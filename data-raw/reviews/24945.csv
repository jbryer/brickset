"InvisibleTimmy","2017-12-19T15:38:31.55Z","“It was opened?” “Just a smidge.”","<p>Box and Instructions</p>

<p>The box is of normal size for a 300 or so piece set. The instructions <span style=""-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);"">came bent.</span></p>

<p><span style=""-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);""><img alt="""" src=""https://images.brickset.com/sets/small/71253-1.jpg"" style=""width: 240px; height: 156px;"" /></span></p>

<h3><span style=""-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0);"">Minifigure&nbsp;</span></h3>

<p>The one minifigure&nbsp;in the set is Newt Scamander. Every part of him is unique: Head, hair, torso, legs, and game pad base. Unfortunately, he doesn&#39;t&nbsp;come with his suitcase. Just a fair warning.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>The build is basic. The Niffler, as is the norm, has no paper instructions. MACUSA doorway, however, does have instructions. Although just a facade, it does have some good depth.The lifts are excellently done.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>These parts are exclusive:</p>

<p>2x3 pentagonal tile, reddish brown</p>

<p>2x2 round tile, macusa print, pearl gold</p>

<p>3x3 game base, trans yellow, Newt Scamander print</p>

<p>Claw, dark flesh</p>

<p>These are rare:</p>

<p>2x2 life ring, reddish brown</p>

<p>Story pack baseplate, dark bluish grey</p>

<p>1x1&nbsp;round&nbsp;tile, transparent black</p>

<p>1x1&nbsp;round&nbsp;plate with bar, dark flesh</p>

<h3>Completed Model</h3>

<p>The Niffler&nbsp;is quite cute. Its snout can be posed to look like it&rsquo;s just been sniffing out some treasure, a pile of which it sits upon. It also has some gold round plates in its pouch to represent shiny things it&rsquo;s stolen.</p>

<p>The MACUSA doorway is aesthetically very pleasing. The &nbsp;build is quite accurate to the film, with the MACUSA&nbsp;logo just above the door. The doors and the back of the lifts are made with the Elves fence. The lifts themselves are simple but look good, with accurate gold grating on the wall.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>The in game playability is obviously quite high, given its Story Pack designation. I don&rsquo;t own the game, so that&rsquo;s all I&rsquo;m gonna say.</p>

<p>The MACUSA&nbsp;Model does have some simple play features. The doors can open, and the lifts can be elevated with a basic Technic mechanism that automatically locks it in place. This actually has practical use, because it frees up two spaces for game figures under the lifts, in addition to the ones on the lifts.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>This is a fun little set. The price isn&rsquo;t that bad if you consider that you&rsquo;re getting $20 of game and $2&nbsp;0of LEGO , but if you don&rsquo;t own the game, wait for a discount (I got mine at Best Buy for only $10 USD). All in all, get it now while it&rsquo;s cheap.</p>

"Ephseb","2018-03-09T17:08:41.487Z","A Dimensions Movie Pack, reviewed by a non-Dimensions-player","<h3>Why did I even buy this?</h3>

<p>Well, the Dimensions sets apparently never sold all that well here in Vienna, so all the Toy-and-Videogame-stores still have some packs from 3 years ago rotting on their shelves at retail price. However, since November of 2017, one chain offers a discount of 25% on all Dimensions sets. This week, I saw that those Dimensions sets that were still left had been discounted even further, by 66% (Fun Packs) and 60% (Movie Packs), with an additional discount of 25% on all Lego items. Since the other Lego sets weren&#39;t that interesting to me, I bought 4 Fun Packs (15&euro; total) and 3 copies of this Set, Fantastic Beasts: Play The Movie (45&euro; total).</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very reasonably sized in relation to the amount of pieces and the final build. Not much else is new..</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set really shines here. Several rare brown parts, including the 2x3 flat Shield-shaped plate, lifesavers, and two long plates, are included. The dark grey plate with a 6x6 circular hole, as well as the fences, wings and small clips in gold are also an excellent addition to any collection. The MACUSA Sigil is printed on a 2x2 circular golden plate, and is already a favorite of mine. The Sigil, and the head and body of Scamander are all exclusive to this set, and I imagine you could build a larger (maybe Modular Building-sized) MACUSA using this set and its concepts as a starting point.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Only one here, Newt Scamander, who looks true to Mr. Redmayne in the movie, and has some great printing on both the torso and the legs. He comes with a brown wand.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone when I express my opinion that the inclusion more Minifigs would certainly have made this set more attractive. If it had been up to me, I would&#39;ve put Percival Graves and/or Seraphina Pickery(?), the US equivalent to the minister of magic, into this set alongside Newt.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty nice, took me less than 20 minutes. It&#39;s annoying that the instructions for the Niffler are in the game and not in the booklet with the rest of the build, but it&#39;s a nice challenge to try and build the animal with only the picture on the box as reference. If the golden wings on the main door aren&#39;t aligned properly, the door can&#39;t be closed, so you need to watch out for that.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a nice display piece. If you want to play with it, you&#39;ll probably have to expand it with bricks and plates from your collection. For now, you can move the two elevators up and down, and open/close the golden door. I will keep one built for now, but add the parts from the other 2 to my ever-growing stock of Lego. The Niffler is well-designed (All important aspects of the animal are included, among them the snout, the claws and the poach), even if it&#39;s not to scale with the minifig.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Using the Technic pieces to lift the elevators is a great idea, and implemented well. Now you need to build a second floor...</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have this yet, and want to get it, I&#39;d recommend to go for it if you can find it for 25&euro; or lower. The RRP of 50&euro; is extremely hard to justify. Depending on whether you own the Dimensions videogame and want this set for its intended purpose - to &quot;Play The Movie&quot; - the amount of money you&#39;re willing to spend may vary.</p>

<p>I guess that the whole concept of &quot;Expansion Packs&quot; (equivalent to DLC) for Lego Dimensions played a part in its poor sales (at least judging from the always-full shelves before Fall 2017), as next to no-one was willing to pay 100&euro; for the main game and then around 90&euro; for every wave of Packs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Note: I always base the &quot;value for money&quot; points on the regular retail price, not the amount of money I ended up paying.)</p>

Two lifts on the side can raise and lower, on top of that it is rather wide. But the best aspect of this Gateway model is the fact that you can store more than seven Toys on the Toy Pad when it is attached. While only seven of them can actually be used at one time, the extra lifts on the side of the Gateway allow you to put two more Toy Tags off to the side for quick and easy access and storage of your LEGO Dimensions toys.</span></span></span></span></p>

It uses parts to great effect. The other two models you can rebuild out of these parts however are somewhat weaker. The Sinister Scorpion is anything but, winding up far too cute and oddly proportioned to be anything truly sinister, and the Vicious Vulture is purely a joke. Neither alternate model matches up very closely with the digital counterparts. </span></span></span></span></p>

These levels range in length and enjoyment with the first level originally having a very bad game breaking glitch late in the game, once you make it to the second area of the first level it had the bad tendency to freeze or pause up, mostly when trying to use the Sword Switch to solve one of the puzzles for a Minikit piece.</span></span></span></span></p>

Again, I haven&rsquo;t much to say about this aspect of the game, but I find that these Arenas are at least all fairly unique and interesting, with possibly one or two exceptions. I believe this Arena represents somewhere inside Newt&rsquo;s case, but I could be wrong about that.</span></span></span></span></p>

This makes a grand total of three separate Adventure Worlds you can visit of New York, here and both versions of the Ghostbuster&rsquo;s New York.

So I strongly recommend tracking it down if you skipped it initially. I found this experience to be relatively enjoyable overall, with very little problems or frustrating game play elements and the physical models and Minifigure look great and add a lot. I do feel that the Niffler is the best of the three creature builds though, and feel the others are somewhat superfluous.</span></span></span></span></p>
