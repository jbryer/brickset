<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Packaging</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Raven and Beast Boy are prominent on this box. We also see something new for this packaging, a sticker, yes LEGO and TT intended to make a Teen Titans Go Level for this game, but due to the failing sales and other issues I have no real idea on what the catalyst was, this level was scrapped, but the cut scenes were combined into a &lsquo;New Episode&rsquo; according to the sticker.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">It&rsquo;s obvious this change came late in the game because they used a sticker instead of altering the package to reflect this. Ah well, the package is still the same other than this and so moving on.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Parts</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This set features a very interesting selection of colours for the elements. One model uses light blue primarily and Raven&rsquo;s model is all black. Making for a unique dynamic, it&rsquo;s nice to see all these elements here, but again this is a Dimensions Team Pack and so the parts are on the low count side and often smaller 1x2 or 1x1 elements.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minifigures</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Beast Boy: Beast Boy is a short-legged Minifigure so he has torso printing and facial printing, but nothing on the legs. His torso is a simple print matching the simple animation detailing of the character, the same for his two facial expressions. One is happy while the other is grumpy or angry looking, he comes with a brand new hair element with sculpted ears for the character. And a banana. I do not own the set with the other Beast Boy so I&rsquo;m not sure if he shares any parts with him, I don&rsquo;t think he does though.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Raven: She is a brand new character as a Minifigure, unfortunately they did not include a hair element for her, so she&rsquo;s always wearing her cloak with hood, her face is printed with a calm expression and an angry unleashing the powers of Azarath expression. Her legs did not take advantage of dual-molding, more than likely because it wasn&rsquo;t as common practice at the time, so there&rsquo;s only regular printing for her boots. She also includes a lightning bolt accessory to simulate blasting magical power bolts.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Spellbook of Azarath: This model is very cleverly constructed to represent an open book with a dark spell being unleashed from its pages. This build is extremely fun and relatively easy to build.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Raven Wings: The book is gone now, in its place you build a small pair of wings with an eyeball in the center representing some type of creature. Most of the parts are re-used as a stand while the wings themselves are relatively small and use much less parts than the main book build.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Giant Hand: This creepy magical hand, reminding me of a Wall Master from Zelda, is built out of the same elements. It climbs up out of the stand built on the base of the Toy Tag and the build itself is fairly engaging and very interesting. All three builds are extremely satisfying.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">T-Car: Welcome to the famous model of the team vehicle, built by Cyborg. This particular build doesn&rsquo;t entirely match what I recall from the cartoon, but then again I&rsquo;m basing this on the original Teen Titans and not the TTG series. Overall this is a decent build though, very nice vehicle model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">T-Forklift: Disassemble a car and build it into a Forklift. Why not? This build is pretty fun if a bit simplistic. It is easy to follow along with the in-game manual to build it so there is that going for it.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">T-Plane: This third build is extremely disappointing. It looks more like a T-Plane Rocket Ride for little kids, way too bulky and car-like as a build. The weakest build out of the three models associated with Beast Boy in my opinion.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

The Giant Hand model is extremely menacing in look, and also a lot of fun, the Raven Wings are just ok, not much to say about them.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">T-Car &amp; Alternate Models: All three of these models can have Beast Boy ride on them thanks to the studs inside of them. They look odd with him sitting on top due to the size issue, but they work. T-Car and T-Forklift are fine, T-Plane is just&hellip; terrible in design, it&rsquo;s mostly due to the large wheels, those things just do not do the model justice. I appreciate the attempt, but the third model is terribly ill-proportioned.</span></span></span></span></p>

Exploring it you will find a lot of familiar faces and voice work from the cast, with many puzzles and quests to get involved in. This is a separate Adventure World from The DC world, so if you bring Cyborg and Robin in here you can unlock their TTG forms. But only inside this world. You can also watch the special episode next to the Adventure World portal on the Shard. The episode itself isn&rsquo;t much to discuss, it&rsquo;s clever and fun witty writing what you&rsquo;d expect from the people behind this game.</span></span></span></span></p>

Her Spellbook can Destroy Rainbow LEGO Objects and Red Demon Objects features a Summon Ability and can Sonar Smash. Her Raven Wings can Destroy Gold LEGO Objects and Red Demon Objects, is a Flying vehicle for Flying Races and can Tow-Bar. The Giant Hand can Destroy Cracked LEGO Objects, Dig and has a Super Jump.</span></span></span></span></p>

His T-Car can Super Jump has Tow-Bar and Accelerator Switches abilities. The T-Forklift can do all three of those things and also use Drone Mazes. The T-Plane can do most of that, but swaps out two of the previous abilities to use Flight Docks, Flight Cargo Hooks and can Sail on Water.</span></span></span></span></p>

You can only access the Special Episode with the Team Pack and Raven is essential for solving a few puzzles. The physical models and Minifigures are all, mostly impressive or fun, and it&rsquo;s the only way to own a Raven Minifigure. I can&rsquo;t help but wonder how the Level was originally going to go, lengthwise and puzzles and all that. Oh well, perhaps someday we&rsquo;ll learn more about that. Strongly Recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
