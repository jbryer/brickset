I don&#39;t have the dimensions game, but LEGO has brought several themes and characters that I like into LEGO form through this. Some of them include The A-Team, Doc Brown from Back the the Future and Gollum From Lord of the Rings (I missed these figures when they first came out), and ET. When I first saw pictures of the Gremlins team pack, I was curious&nbsp;about what they were because I had never seen the movie before. I then watched the movie and instantly fell in love with it. I had to get the team pack. As is the case with all dimensions sets, the builds are ok and relate to the movie (the RC car should be pink rather than red), and the Minifigures are spectacular! LEGO doesn&#39;t slack off on any detail and Gizmo and Stripe look&nbsp;lust like they do in the movie. I don&#39;t understand&nbsp;why they give Gizmo a cookie though since Gizmo doesn&#39;t eat anything in the movie. I also think that they should have made a popcorn bucket piece for stripe since they printed one on his toy tag. All they had to do was include the existing bucked mold in red with white printed stripes, or white with red stripes. Going back to the builds, i think that three of the six possible builds are appropriate to the movie. The RC car, the Flash n finish, and the record rampage player are all things that we see in one way, shape, or form in the movie. The other three have nothing to do with the movie. So over all, I think the only reason why anyone should get this and any other dimensions set is for the Minifigures.</p>

With Series 2 however we got a whole lot more classics from the 80&rsquo;s introduced in a variety of packs. Joining Ghostbusters, Back to the Future and Midway Arcade were such notable classics as E.T. The Extra Terrestrial, Knight Rider, The A-Team, Beetlejuice, The Goonies and of course one of the all-time most horrific Christmas Movies in the PG rating era. Gremlins. Fun Fact: With E.T and Gremlins joining the game we now have three franchises helmed by Steven Spielberg in the same game, a pity Indiana Jones couldn&rsquo;t have been brought back for a pack.</span></span></span></span></p>

Love the look of this package, also the back shows off the Adventure World and that thing looks crazy, with a huge city and a small town side-by-side with only a small snow covered mountain area to serve as a boundary between both hub areas. It&rsquo;s a great look at what to expect when you start playing.</span></span></span></span></p>

No unique prints or other parts will be found here outside of the Toy Tags, however that isn&rsquo;t exactly a bad thing. It means if you want to build the models you can always find the parts from different sources and make the models in this set without picking it up.</span></span></span></span></p>

LEGO chose not to use dual-molding or even print the top of the legs to match the brown on the torso, which means Gizmo is not entirely accurate to his on-screen counterpart. The head is a unique sculpted element and he includes a printed 1x1 stud/plate for a cookie. Just don&rsquo;t feed him after midnight or else&hellip;</span></span></span></span></p>

His legs are re-using the Faun legs from the CMF Series which featured him, most of the detailing adds stripes and other detailing on the torso arms and legs, as well as tiny claws on his feet. He has a unique head sculpt as well which is a great match for the character.</span></span></span></span></p>

Racer: This model was a real treat to build and represents scenes from the movie very well. It&rsquo;s another great car model and we&rsquo;ve seen quite a number of these in LEGO Dimensions, with each build managing to look and feel different enough from one another to not be boring or repetitive.</span></span></span></span></p>

Racer &amp; Alternate Builds: All three of these models are pretty fun, the Racer is a solid build and a solid model, the Gadget-o-matic is wacky and fun with some really curious design choices and the Scarlet Scorpion manages to make a better Scorpion model&nbsp; compared to the one found in the Fantastic Beasts story pack. And this Scorpion model doesn&rsquo;t even quite match up with the digital model in-game, but it is still better implemented than what we got in that other set.</span></span></span></span></p>

In fact, both sections of the world are like mini hubs for both films with the first area being the small town where Gremlins took place and then the large city where its sequel took place. You can engage in a lot of puzzles and quests, be aware though that there is one particularly annoying game glitch in this world. In the small town you can enter the Movie Theatre, this door has a glitch that sometimes causes the load screen to freeze up and force you to shut off the entire system. It&rsquo;s a huge pain.</span></span></span></span></p>

Recommend it. Just get this set, I mean there was that one glitch, but other than that everything else was perfect. The comedy, the style, the adventure; it&rsquo;s all a wonderful digital experience with some great physical toys to add to the fun. It&rsquo;s also a must own set if you want to unlock the entire LEGO Dimensions Shard experience. Highly Recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
