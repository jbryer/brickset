He is holding a plant and his Toy Tag is printed with the iconic over the moon scene on the back. (Meaning behind where the character stands.)</span></span></span></span></p>

The satellite model is also really clever in design and is a great source for making some extra satellites with other parts to populate your LEGO Space/City display.</span></span></span></span></p>

I recommend picking this set up not only for the digital content, but because E.T. as a character is highly fun looking in design and the Minifigure can join your Star Wars alien collection thanks to ILM sticking them into the Senate Scenes in the Prequel Trilogy.

"Studded_Dud","2020-07-20T05:17:22.047Z","E.T. Phone 5 Stars","<p>Building Experience: E.T. has a very good looking&nbsp;flower that he holds. The phone is a very cool build and it actually looks quite like an actual phone.</p>

<p>Parts: There are some pretty good parts including E.T.&#39;s moulded head. It includes a whip which looks excellent as the cord for the phone. There is one printed tile that has the numbers for the phone. There is a silver radar dish on the bottom and of course the trans-yellow 2x2 round brick that all year two Dimensions sets include.</p>

<p>Playability: The physical build doesn&#39;t actually have any real play features, but in-game there is plenty for play. This unlocks many abilities from both the phone and E.T. himself. It also unlocks the E.T. world where you can free roam and complete quests around with all the characters that you own.</p>

<p>Value For Money: Though this set only has 42 parts and costs&nbsp;&pound;14.99 / $11.99 it has very good value for the game as it is the only pack that can unlock the E.T. world which is quite necessary to beat the complete game.</p>

<p>Overall: Overall this is a really great set that deserves 5 stars and to be in your collection especially if you are a fan of the great movie. If you have not seen the movie it is a classic and a must watch.</p>

"Brick_Connections","2020-11-14T20:49:21.177Z","Dimensions does it again!!!","<p>I&#39;ve always loved Dimensions. I got into the game&nbsp;in 2016, shortly after this Fun Pack was released. When I bought the game, I knew I had to get this fun pack. This is one of my most favourite fun packs of the game and love the 80s nostalgia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Packaging</strong></h2>

<p>As always, the Dimensions packaging style is different from normal LEGO sets, but has always been welcomed by me. The picture of the moon is one of the most iconic scenes in the film, and was awesome to see here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Minifigure</strong></h2>

<p>There&#39;s only one minfigure in this fun pack, hence the name &#39;Fun Pack&#39;, but it is an awesome one. It&#39;s also exclusive!!!&nbsp;The printing on the front and back of the torso are fantastic and very true to the source material. The head mold is obviously new for the time and captures E.T.&#39;s head shape perfectly. The addition of the flower is an obvious nod to the popular trop in the film where the flower wilts, but is later re-grown by E.T. The toy tag has some awesome printing as well, including the iconic &#39;bike across the moon&#39; icon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Build</b></h2>

<p>The other build in this pack, labelled&nbsp;<em>Phone Home</em>, is an obvious nod to E.T.&#39;s famous catchphrase &quot;E.T. phone home&quot;. The build resembles a common 80s household caller and receiver. The other builds, called&nbsp;<em>Mobile Uplink&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Super-Charged Satellite</em>&nbsp;are awesome as well. The Mobile Uplink closely resembles the &#39;phone&#39; E.T. builds in the film, while the Super-Charged Satellite resembles a satellite. All three builds and the E.T. minifigure have incredible abilities inside the core game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Gameplay</strong></h2>

<h3>Adventure World</h3>

<p>In the core&nbsp;<em>LEGO Dimensions&nbsp;</em>videogame, the fun pack unlocks the E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial Adventure World. Inside this world is a bunch of nostalgic easter eggs to the film, as well as in-game characters seen. You can accept quests from Elliot, Michael, Gretie, Mary, and Keys and visit locations such as Elliot&#39;s house, E.T.&#39;s spaceship, and the elementary school.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>When you play as E.T. in game, you get many abilities to choose from, some echoing moments in the film. He can do Fix-It spots, echoing his ability to fix things in the film; growth, echoing the flower growing; heart regeneration, echoing his healing abilities; magic, echoing his ability to move things with his mind; and stealth, echoing Gertie&#39;s costume for the alien as well as some others.</p>

<h3>Gadget</h3>

<p>The gadget has some callbacks as well. When a character uses &#39;Phone Home&#39;, it calls in Elliot on his BMX bicycle. You can then ride around on the bike as well as fly it, an obvious nod to the end of the film. Similarly, when a character uses &#39;Mobile Uplink&#39;, a brick-built miniature version of E.T.&#39;s Spaceship appears. You can ride on this as well. The last rebuild, &#39;Super-Charged Satellite&#39; is a flying vehicle that shoots a powerful laser beam out the front.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>The set is price in retrospect when compared price-per-peice, but it&#39;s still a wonderfully designed set and worth the price, even if you don&#39;t have the core game. You can use the figure in the game or out in your own LEGO play or display.</p>
