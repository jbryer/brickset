<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the same size as the Protectors form last year, however it uses a thicker cardboard that will make the boxes not very breakable. The instructions is the standard size same as the protectors with the comic of Lewa and Uxar uniting to defeat Umarak. In the back is the same old mix of posters that they stick in the back of all these sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>this set has some cool system wing panel type parts, two of the new sword parts, the new axle/gears for the gear sytem. Also is more of the now common beast fin/leg from Hero Factory. The unity piece, trans-green bones and a lot of technic bits to form the wings and body. Also some cool new parts are the shadow trap pieces and legs plus the tail pieces.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was rather quick and fun the way I like my action figure sets to be. The gear system is rather cool and has some really nice pieces with the gears.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This set is rather boring without the inclusion of Lewa to have a unite feature. unlike Akida with twin blasters he gets a nice pair of wings and some legs and a head. To activate the action feature you move the tail up and down. The really cool thing about this set is the shadow trap. These are way more interesting and fun the age old spidery enemy thing we have gotten since 2014 with the Jumpers. You can make the legs move but more importantly you can snap shut the trap like a bear trap. This is fun as you can snag Uxar so that Umarak (if you have him) can control him and have him stuck. the tail is cool as it gives you more of the same cool Hero cuff link pieces as stated first seen back in 2012 for Hero Cuffs. The model is fun to fly around but is a little boring.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set should be a good buy if you want to have a creature that fits in with the jungle theme, or if you want all shadow traps, or lastly if you want a creature for Lewa so he can fly.</p>

"Dragon_Master_48","2019-08-26T00:50:42.937Z","A Fantastic Complement to Uniter Lewa","<p><strong>71300 Uxar - Creature of Jungle</strong> is one of the Elemental Creatures of the second year of the BIONICLE Reboot theme, and complements 71305 Lewa - Uniter of Jungle. Although having more pieces than Lewa does, most of those pieces are smaller, and some of them contribute to the shadow trap, which are only included with the smaller sets this year, unlike the Skull Spiders which were included with both Toa and Protectors in the original wave. Aforementioned shadow traps are larger and have a bit more personality to them then the Skull Spiders, although it&#39;s difficult to get them open sometimes, and I personally prefer being able to wear the Skull Spider like a mask.</p>

<p>Uxar has four small limbs that can move into various positions, although the front limbs have better articulation than the back ones. The wings can move if you move the tail up and down, which looks a bit awkward but is an understandable function. I&#39;m not sure if this is an intentional function or just something they weren&#39;t able to fix, but the tip of the tail can also move side to side ever so slightly, which can help if you want to make it look like Uxar is flying in a certain direction.</p>

<p>The build is pretty neat, considering it&#39;s not a standard constraction figure but rather, a constraction creature. It&#39;s especially neat when you consider that the build was devised to be compatabile with Lewa, as the proportions allow it to wrap around the Toa nicely, making use of the special &quot;Uniter&quot; piece on the chest to facilitate a connection. The parts are really good as well, especially the gears with axles sticking out of them, and all the green pieces are great and give Uxar a distinctive &quot;Jungle&quot; look.</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Looks really great on its own and works well with Lewa.</li>
	<li>Pieces are great, especially the green-colored ones.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Having the tail stick up to move the wings is a little awkward-looking.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I&#39;d definitely recommend this set, especially in conjunction with Lewa. I might be biased, but I think it&#39;s probably the best looking out of all the Elemental Creatures!</p>
