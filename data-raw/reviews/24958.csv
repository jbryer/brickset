<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The standard rectangular box for constraction figures. The front shows Chirrut in a battle on Jedha and the back shows him and two panels indicating the features of his modified bowcaster. The Shoretrooper and Baze Malbus are also displayed on the bottom.<br />
There is one rectangular instruction book.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Price per part ratio is as expected for this type of set. The figure includes some nice new parts for the Star Wars constraction range and the cloth kama is superbly made.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Total building time, 10 minutes.<br />
The build is remarkably similar to all other figures in the constraction range with some nice additions to the standard structure that deal with some of the issues from earlier figures. The bowcaster construction is nicely done with care to remain faithful to the on-screen version.<br />
There are no stickers and the printing for the left arm and torso are excellent.&nbsp;<br />
The kama is a single large cloth piece that attaches at the base of Chirrut&#39;s back and wraps around the body twice, fastening each time to remain secure. This can be a little fiddly for those of us with large hands.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Probably one of my favourite constraction figures to date. Admittedly human figures are harder to do because the head and neck part lets the look down. Chirrut&#39;s head is nicely done although a little more attention to his eyes would&#39;ve been welcome. The neck is not really visible from the back due to a wheel arch, serving as folded cloth.<br />
The modified bowcaster is fantastically realised in Lego form and it can be cranked via the upper middle handle, as in the movie, to deploy the bows outwards for firing or folded neatly back for when carried. The inside has a spring loaded missile launcher which is activated by the gold rod on the top.<br />
Standing 24 cm tall, he looks impressive on display, especially if paired with his friend, Baze Malbus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>A fine figure. Plenty of poseability and play potential, coupled with an excellent weapon make Chirrut one of the best in the line to date. My only quibble is that he does not have his staff weapon. For the sake of a half dozen more pieces this would&#39;ve made him complete but it&#39;s easy enough to make with a few Technic rods and lightsaber hilt pieces. This second wave of Rogue One constraction figures is proving to be more impressive than the first.</p>
