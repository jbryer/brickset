"TK_1308","2016-05-09T15:33:06.417Z","""The Droid Army is starting up their shield generators.""","<p>Lego expands the series of Revenge Of The Sith sets with the Homing Spider Droid and a scattering of Separatist and Republic forces.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nice long mid range box. Yoda is the figure of choice on the top. The front shows the Homing Spider Droid and the Dwarf Spider Droid emerging from the water to attack the Republic forces. The back shows a similar battle scene with several panels indicating all the play features and weapons.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The price per piece ratio for a kit of this size is slightly higher than it should be. This kit is about &pound;5 overpriced. Nothing particularly of note in this set.<br />
There are three bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains the Baktoid Armour Workshop DSD1 Dwarf Spider Droid, the 2 B1 series Battle Droids and the middle ring of the Baktoid Armour Workshop OG-9 Homing Spider Droid.<br />
Bag 2 contains the Elite Corps Clone Troopers, the upper body of the OG-9 and the upper leg struts.<br />
Bag 3 contains Yoda, the lover hull, lower legs and underside cannon of the OG-9.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with Yoda, an Elite Corps Clone Trooper and 2 B1 series Battle Droids. Unfortunately, all these are reissues so there&#39;s nothing new here.<br />
Yoda is the nicest figure in the set but is a reissue of the figure released in 2013&#39;s Duel on Geonosis. He comes armed with his trusty lightsaber.<br />
The Elite Corps Clone Trooper is identical as the ones issues in 2014&#39;s Kashyyyk Troopers battle pack. He&#39;s armed with a black blaster.<br />
Finally, the generic B1 Battle Droids, armed with blasters pad out the set<br />
This is a shame as it would&#39;ve been nice to include at least one new figure, like Stass Allie in the 2013 version of this set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 15 minutes.<br />
Nothing unusual in the build and it&#39;s a pretty straightforward kit with regards to construction. It&#39;s almost identical to the 2013 version of this set with a couple of minor cosmetic changes to accommodate the stud shooters.<br />
The DSD-1 takes a couple of minutes to build. The upper antenna and leg colour have changed and there is a forward mounted stud shooter. This is mounted on a ball joint so it has a good range of movement and firing arcs. Each leg is triple jointed.<br />
The OG-9 is almost&nbsp;identical in build with the exception of the upper and lower cannons. The upper hull can rotate around the body, the legs can flex in and out to change the height and standing stance. Now it is armed with a rotary stud shooter on the lower hull.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Both large droids are nothing spectacular but if you missed the opportunity to get the 2013 version then this would be a must for your Separatist forces.<br />
The DSD-1 looks slightly better than the previous releases and the stud shooter makes for a tidier front section.<br />
The OG-9 is fine but to be honest, the stud shooter doesn&#39;t really add a lot to it at all.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Not a bad kit but not one of the greatest either. Almost being a direct reissue from something we had a mere 3 years ago smacks of desperation when Lego could make other sets from Revenge Of The Sith. The lack of anything &#39;exclusive&#39; to this set makes it one for those who missed the earlier release or the total completists. Otherwise, save your money and invest in something with a little more to it.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard packaging and instructions - nothing too special</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nice selection of parts but again nothing special, except the Yoda head mold and maybe the (now more common) six shooter</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Yoda, Kashyyyk Clone Trooper and two Battle Droids.</p>

<p>The battle Droids are a good addition and&nbsp;very common/amassable, however,&nbsp;for &pound;34.99 I would have liked to see a Super Battle Droid thrown in..</p>

<p>Yoda and the Clone Trooper are really where the set fails, unfortunately. The Spider Droid is only seen in RoTS on&nbsp;Felucia and NOT Kashyyyk. Therefore these releases are rather boring and inaccurate. A new 327th Trooper (maybe even an official Bly?) and a live action Aayla Secura would really have made this set</p>

<h3>The build &amp; Model</h3>

<p>Almost identical to 2013 build but slightly updated so not as wobbly with stability of legs improved and a six shooter added. On the whole still a great design and looks perfect! The addition of the Dwarf&nbsp;Spider Droid is also really good and, unlike the one from 7670, includes a transparent piece to hold it up.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The CIS aspect of the set is almost spot on but the set is let down by the lack of any new minifigures/builds such as the 327th Trooper mentioned and suffers as a result.</p>

<p>For the price it is an OK deal - 310 pieces for &pound;35 - but maybe &pound;30 would have been better as this was the RRP of the previous model.</p>

<p>On the whole though this is a great set for many people as it includes the&nbsp;sought after&nbsp;Yoda minifigure, multiple large droids, 2 Battle Droids and a Kashyyyk Trooper.</p>

<p>I would recommend this set</p>

"Kevmiester","2017-07-31T03:10:30.983Z","Great Clone Wars Set","<p>I would give this set a definite four star rating, however I gave it a five star review to balance out with the other two preexisting reviews as of 7/30/17.</p>

<p>This set is built quite differently from the last spider droid Lego released. The legs are somewhat repetitive to build, but it doesn&#39;t take that long to build. The legs can be hard to move, specifically on Lego base plates, but I&#39;m not sure what they could have done better. The spider droid has a big stud shooter at the bottom, and I&#39;ve never been a fan of those. Luckily it&#39;s not easy to accidentally fire them in this set, yet it is easy to purposely&nbsp;do so.</p>

<p>The Minifigures are great. I appreciate that Lego has brought back the old Yoda mold and has upgraded the printing on it. I also like the camo&nbsp;printing on the clone trooper.</p>

<p>All in all, this set is really nice by itself and will compliment any clone wars collection.</p>
