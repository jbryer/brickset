<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I like the Speed Champions boxes, they give a sense of high quality with the black background and racing graphics.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Standard parts for the most part.&nbsp; The rear underbody diffuser to me was the most unique part in this set.&nbsp; A lot of stickers as you would guess for a race car, but I was disappointed that a lot of the details of the car itself&nbsp;were in sticker form, like the vents, grills, lights, and&nbsp;exhaust pipes.&nbsp; Very distracting from the set as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trophy and stand were a nice addition to the set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure has a smirk and a cool R8 shirt on the&nbsp;torso.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This was a fun set for my son (4yo) to build with some of my assistance.&nbsp; No overly complicated steps, but the stickers took time and care to make sure they were properly applied.&nbsp; I liked the use of SNOT&nbsp;to make&nbsp;the trademark R8 side scoops.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This set stays together well and can be played with without falling apart, even with the articulating rear wing.&nbsp; However, the finished set barely resembles the real life R8 race car.&nbsp; The front&nbsp;fascia sticker detailing is probably the worst part of all, yet without it you wouldn&#39;t know it was an R8 (aside from the several stickers in several places that actually say &quot;R8&quot; on it).&nbsp; Mostly, the proportions are entirely too exaggerated.&nbsp; The real car is very wide and very low, so this LEGO interpretation should have been at minimum one stud wider on each side, if not two.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The saving grace for this kit is that it had a fairly low price per piece considering it is a licensed product.&nbsp; I think the other cars in this LEGO line are more true to their real life counterparts.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Box and instructions</h2>

<p>The set comes in a typical Speed Champions box with the LEGO logo and Audi logo in opposite corners. As it&#39;s a race car it&#39;s shown on the finish line&nbsp; with the driver holding a golden trophy.</p>

<p>The instructions are faultless and easy to follow, I assume even for very young builders.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>The parts count of 175 is similar to most of the single car sets. As is obvious from the picture, most of the parts are black and white with a little red thrown in. Some of the more interesting parts are four of the newish big wheel arches, two in white at the front and two black at the back. A good few curved slopes including the new for me 2x3 in black. There are 3 inverted 2x2 tiles in black and some regular tiles. You also get a pair of the 2x2 wedge plates in black.</p>

<p>Speed Champions sets come with stickers, especially the race cars and this one is no exception: 24 stickers go on the car and there are 2 for the chequered flags. Why Lego is not using the existing printed chequered flags for this theme is beyond me. There are two printed parts though, a pair of red 1x1 tiles with the top printed white. As usual the light on dark print does not look good but it doesn&#39;t stand out in the model.</p>

<p>In the bonnet/hood are two white 1x2 plates that I don&#39;t understand. The entire top of the car is covered in curved slopes and tiles, and 1x2 white tiles are used elsewhere in the set.</p>

<h2>Minifigure</h2>

<p>The driver is a bit plain with no print on either his legs or helmet and a head that&#39;s been used in more than 30 other sets. The torso is nice with an R8 branded jacket, printed front and back.</p>

<h2>Building</h2>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting enough build for a small set with a fair bit of SNOT action, more than your typical front and back put on sideways. Putting all the stickers on properly takes a good bit of the build time. To make the car look good you need to be careful and align various stickers. Not that hard with the Fairy liquid trick but time consuming all the same.</p>

<h2>The finished model</h2>

<p>If you know anything about cars you will recognise this as an Audi R8 thanks to the iconic black panels on the side. Given the size of the model they are well done, even if they do need a small sticker. At the back there are stickers for the proper shape of the tail lights and the exhausts and a spoiler from the Tiny Turbo&#39;s to finish the shape. The rear spoiler is built upside down and attached with skeleton arms which is has been done before.</p>

<p>Sofar so good; from the side and rear the car looks pretty good. At the front things go wrong. Audi must have insisted on stickers to accurately depict their grille with logo and headlights and ironically that&#39;s the worst part of the car, it just looks really bad.</p>

<p>These cars are all too tall or not wide enough, whichever way you look at it, and that&#39;s fine, they&#39;re minifig cars. The problem with the stickers at the front is they needed a flat surface to put the stickers on, and that makes the front just too tall in proportion to the rest of the car.</p>

<h2>Play</h2>

<p>Children won&#39;t care too much about how accurate the shape of the car is. It&#39;s a cool looking race car and look, the driver is on the podium with a gold trophy!</p>

<p>It&#39;s vroomable but it doesn&#39;t really have any other play functions. You can swap the wheel covers but as they are black covers on black rims with black tyres it doesn&#39;t make a whole lot of difference.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>At around &euro;0.10 per part it&#39;s decent value for a licensed set with a minifigure. It&#39;s not very accurate as a model but still reconisable and the podium and trophy add some play features. All in all not a bad set.</p>
