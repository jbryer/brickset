<p>The set could be good with just 919 but adding the legendary 917 is just overkill!</p>

<p>both cars look good, both are enjoyable to build and play with.</p>

<p>Minifigures are exclusive and diverse.</p>

<p>the pitlane/pitstop transforms into garage - for storage and additional playability, there is quite a lot of tools&nbsp;for minifigs added. really good set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>on the cons - it&#39;s not a cheap set, and has a ton of stickers (but really they make a great effect!) - but in my opinion it is worth it!</p>

<p>best part is we got this with my 8y old son for Xmas - and had great time puting&nbsp;this together and playing afterwards. - really recommend this to any 24h LeMans&nbsp;fans</p>
