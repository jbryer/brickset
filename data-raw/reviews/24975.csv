<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It is the standard type of Lego ideas &quot;fancy boxes&quot; and nice instruction with the information in the front</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is some pretty cool pieces such as the 12th doctors hair and the sonic screwdriver</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get lots of nice mini figures&nbsp;such as the daleks&nbsp;which are my favorite. The weeping angel is also pretty nice.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was 4 stars because the control center was not the most interesting build, although the TARDIS was pretty fun to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Once built the control center is pretty cool and the TARDIS&nbsp;is a-w-e-s-o-m-e.</p>

<p>the TARDIS opens by flipping up two tiles on the side of&nbsp;the TARDIS&nbsp;and TARDIS&nbsp;connects to the control cent by a peg.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I would recommend this set. $60 for 623 pieces&nbsp;means about 10 cents a piece which is a good value.</p>

"Frogan","2015-12-14T20:04:14.183Z","Allons-y - to the store and buy it!","<p>This is actually my first review on Brickset ever, and English is not my first language, so please excuse my spelling or grammar errors, as I&#39;m sure some have evaded my proofreading. I&#39;ve recently watched the first few series of the post 2005 Dr. Who series, and I liked them so much that a) I got the Lego set, and b) felt compelled to write this small review. But how about we stop the introduction right here and go to the interesting parts. &ndash; &quot;Allons-y!&quot;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes with the usual Lego Ideas box: Sturdy, opens with a flap, nicely printed. The last aspect is also valid for the instructions. I&#39;ve not encountered any quality issues, which where common with earlier manuals under the Ideas brand. As always, the instructions come with comments from the designers, and the occasional in-universe information about characters, monsters or gadgets from the Doctor Who series. I&#39;ve not counted them, but I think they are more scarce than in earlier manuals of licensed Ideas sets. Still it makes for a nice addition, and one could say: &ndash; &quot;I wouldn&#39;t have missed it for the world&quot;.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>With over 600 parts included, this set has got an (at least for me) acceptable price per piece ratio, especially considering, it is a licensed set. I have to admit that the parts are rather small, so the finished model doesn&#39;t look like a 600 parts set, but this has become a trend with the more recent Lego sets.</p>

<p>What sticks out is that there are no stickers, even for the Doctor Who specific parts. For me this wouldn&#39;t be that big of a deal, but I know there are Lego enthusiasts who detest stickers for understandable reasons, so that&#39;s fantastic. Then we&#39;ve got lots of other printed tiles, and parts, which would do good service in a spaceship, be it in a cockpit, or an engine room for example.</p>

<p>The colour palette of the parts used is dominated by grey and blue tones, and especially the earth blue parts used for the TARDIS are excellent.</p>

<p>Last but not least, there&#39;s a specially molded sonic screwdriver, the Doctor&#39;s always handy tool, which has saved his and the life of others numerous times. &ndash; &quot;I like it. Doesn&#39;t kill, doesn&#39;t wound, doesn&#39;t maim. But I&#39;ll tell you what it does do: It is very good at opening doors.&quot;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The &quot;good guys&quot; are composed of three minifigs. All of them have double side printed torsos and printing on the legs. The protagonist is included in not only one, but two forms, namely the 11th and 12th Doctor. Both are rather accurately represented. The 12th Doctor though hasn&#39;t got a double sided head.</p>

<p>The companion is Clara Oswald, the - to date - longest-serving companion in the new show. She too looks good, has a double sided head, one side shows a scared face, the other a neutral one. It might have been nice, if other companions would&#39;ve been included.</p>

<p>A Weeping Angel serves as foe. It has an excellent double sided head, one side showing a neutral expression, and the other with fletched teeth.</p>

<p>While not exactly minifigures, I&#39;ll also mention the Daleks here. The are brick-built, and good imaginations of their TV counterparts. The printed dome is fantastic. It would have been nice, if the lights would protrude like on TV. A note about the colour scheme: In the series it looks rather bronze metallic, the Lego version is in brown tones. While not perfect, it is okay. What is strange is that this version of the Daleks was most prominent during the 9th and 10th Doctors&#39; tenures. Nonetheless, they have but one goal. &ndash; &quot;Exterminate!&quot;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building starts, as usual with the minifigures. Next is the TARDIS control room. The highlight is, of course the centerpiece, the control console, which makes for an interesting build. Next are the 2 Daleks.Finally, the one piece, most of the Doctor Who fans where waiting for, the police box concludes the build.</p>

<p>While there are a few steps one could consider repetitive, they are not very long. The methods used are not that complicated or advanced, and they do their best do make for an authentic representation. &ndash; &quot;Fantastic!&quot;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>My main critique with this set are related to the opening mechanism of the TARDIS. First you have to remove the roof, to connect the box with the interior. And second, there is no way to enter the police box from the front, which would have added to the play value for kids. From an AFOL&#39;s perspective though, this is neglectable.</p>

<p>From a fan&#39;s perspective, one could consider this set a paradox for the following reasons. The control room is from series 7 - till the 12th Doctor renovates it it in series 8. The Doctors are from series 5 to (at least) 9. Clara accompanied the Doctor during series 7 to 9. So this side of the model depicts a rather short timespan between series 7 and 8. What doesn&#39;t fit in this timeline though are the Doctor&#39;s opponents: The Daleks colour scheme doesn&#39;t fit, since it changed in series 5 to a more colorful one, and the Weeping Angel have had only cameo appearances in the later series, they were more prominently in series 5.</p>

<p>So how does the TARDIS hold up after all? Great, I especially like that the stairway leaves the possibility to extend it&#39;s interior to rooms and areas seen ore mentioned in the TV series. You know, like a library or a swimming pool. &ndash; &quot;It&#39;s bigger on the inside.&quot;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Does the mentioned paradox annoy me? Well, actually no, for me it is a good compromise. Should it annoy Whovians? Probably a little, but does it really matter so much. In fact, as there are multiple Doctor&#39;s and foes, the set is pretty versatile and makes for a good play value. One could even think of their own Christmas special and have the two Doctor&#39;s work together. And if, like me, you&#39;ve got no intentions to play with the set, it is an excellent display piece, even if you have to display the police box alone. Personally I would have liked it, if the 10th Doctor was present, so I could say &quot;Allons-y&quot; more often, but maybe he&#39;ll get his own set in the future. The license definitely has got enough material to earn his own line, let&#39;s see, if Lego further publishes DW sets.</p>

<p>I hope you&#39;ve enjoyed my review, and concerning my final verdict: Run to the store and get one, it&#39;s fantastic. &ndash; &quot;I said run!&quot;</p>

"PeteM","2015-12-24T19:24:24.17Z","A Madman With A Box","<p>I honestly can&rsquo;t remember which entered my life first &ndash; Lego or Doctor Who. One of my first and clearest childhood memories is building track for <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7720-1/Diesel-Freight-Train-Set"">#7720</a> across the living room floor, while on television a giant polystyrene statue fell on Colin Baker. Both became icons of my childhood that I&rsquo;ve stubbornly refused to let go of, despite varying lengths of time away from each, so the announcement from Lego Ideas that they would finally be drawn together in an official set succeeded in sending two of my fan genes into overdrive at the same time.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;I always read the instructions&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The box is the same high-quality flip top affair common to both the Ideas and Architecture ranges and is filled to brim with unmarked bags containing the 623 pieces. The instructions are a fairly weighty tome laid flat at the bottom, with the 100-odd steps required for the model well laid out, and clear and simple to follow, easily satisfying the 10+ rating on the box. As with all Ideas sets there are also a few &lsquo;extras&rsquo; &ndash; in this case some background on the programme, characters and the TARDIS, as well as some words from the original designer Andrew Clarke and the Lego designers tasked with translating the submission into an actual set (one of whom is serendipitously related to Doctor No. 8 Paul McGann). There are also numerous bite sized facts about the show and model spread throughout the booklet.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;For some people, small beautiful things are&nbsp;what life is all about!&rdquo;</h3>

<p>It is no surprise that the parts that immediately draw the eye are those in the rather lovely shade of deep blue that make up the TARDIS exterior. These are mostly plate or tile based, as well as the blue window frames and matching solid panes.</p>

<p>There is an absolute riot of printed pieces, most noticeably those used for the TARDIS exterior. The print for each &lsquo;Police Public Call Box&rsquo; sign is split across two 1x3 tiles (for reasons that become clear later), and there is also printing on a total of ten of the window pieces, eight with the window panes design, one with the &lsquo;Pull to open&rsquo; sign and one with the St John&rsquo;s Ambulance crest. There are also two 2x2 round tiles printed with a &lsquo;Dalek head&rsquo; design (lights and other detailing) as well as numerous computer panel type prints, some of which are generic while others are unique to this set.</p>

<p>The only other parts which were new to me were both transparent &ndash; a neck brace with two studs facing outwards, and a single 1x1 tile with a spike on it, both of which are new to sets in 2015. The remaining pieces mainly consist of a wide variety of standard plates and bricks in shades of grey which make up the console room.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;You can&#39;t mend people!&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The Twelfth Doctor is wearing his immediate post-regeneration outfit from the beginning of his debut story (shed less than ten minutes into his first episode and never seen again), a sort of hairy purple suit inherited from the final days of the Eleventh Doctor. Maybe a tad brighter than what was seen on screen, this is none the less an excellent representation of the costume. The new hairpiece is a fairly good match for Peter Capaldi&rsquo;s Season 8 style and is currently unique to only Doctor Who sets.</p>

<p>The Eleventh Doctor is resplendent in his &lsquo;iconic&rsquo; look from Matt Smith&rsquo;s first few seasons, namely the tweed suit and bow tie. The printing from the jacket continues onto the top of the legs, though it isn&rsquo;t a great colour match between the two elements, possibly due to the legs having a brown background colour which may have dimmed the lighter tan printing.</p>

<p>Clara is perhaps the most generic of the selection, though does get some well-done dual-moulded legs with a tartan miniskirt and black jacket, as per her appearance in Matt Smith&rsquo;s swansong &lsquo;The Time of the Doctor&rsquo;.</p>

<p>The Weeping Angel is a fantastic representation of one of the scariest monsters in Doctor Who history, the killer statues that remain stationary while observed . . . until you blink . . . It is complete with dual-sided face, one calm serene expression and the other a terrifying jagged-toothed scream representing the Angel as it attacks it&rsquo;s prey. The torso and sloped &lsquo;dress&rsquo; brick are both printed with a stone-carved drapes design and the wings are mounted onto the back via the transparent neck brace and two clips.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;So yeah, we&#39;re gonna build a TARDIS&rdquo;</h3>

<p>The build starts with fairly simple plate and inverted wedge brick arrangements forming the initial &ldquo;undercroft&rdquo; and decking section of the console room. The time rotor is sub-build all of its own, and consists of numerous elements threaded onto two Technic rods, starting with a large webbed radar disk on top. There is a little repetition when it comes to creating the six sides of the central console as they are all based on an identical base build &ndash; two wedge plates combined at 90 degrees to each other, with a 1x2 clip at the back &ndash; but all feature a slightly different build on the main &lsquo;face&rsquo;. These clip onto a neat little construction at the base of the time rotor build, where two stacked fly wheels hold six pneumatic hose connectors evenly spaced around the outside, cleverly creating six connection points all facing in different directions. The two sets of angled railings around the outside of the main walkway look straightforward &ndash; just three light grey bars joined together by angled Technic connectors &ndash; but they are quite difficult to get in place evenly, despite the fact that the clips that attach it to the floor section are able to both revolve and flex up and down. Much easier are the wide flat computer consoles constructed from a few wedge plates and more printed tiles, which just clip onto the railings.</p>

<p>The Daleks are deceptively simple, with a core of stacked plates and SNOT bricks, onto which wedge plates are mounted on either side.&nbsp; The distinctive sloped shape of the base is approximated by 1x2 plates front and back that are angled on clips. Above this a 1x2 jumper plate allows transition to 2x2 round plates, with the eyestalk piece sandwiched between these and the printed round tile on top.</p>

<p>Finally &ndash; the TARDIS! Starting with an odd 7x7 base, the outer edges are tiled all the way around and the base is mostly in-filled with silver 1x2 grilles. Gaps are left for two 2x2 plates, a&nbsp;cunning way to create a half stud offset without using any &lsquo;jumper&rsquo; elements by adding plates to the layer above. Two of the sides hinge half way down their length, sliding over the grill and plate base to create a square 6x6 area when closed. The panelled walls are simply a series of window frames with the correct blank or printed panes inserted at the right level. These are joined at each corner by 1x1 plates and 1x1 bricks with a stud on the side, stacked to the same height as the walls and with 1x8 dark blue tiles attached vertically to provide the offset pillar detailing. Each of the Police Box signs are mounted onto one side of a corner plate, with the two on the sides affixed to hinges to allow them to swivel upwards. The roof is constructed simply from basic plates and tiles, held in place by two 2x2 jumper plates on the main body which allow for easy removal.</p>

<h3>&ldquo;There&#39;s no point being grown-up if you can&#39;t be childish sometimes.&rdquo;</h3>

<p>If you&#39;ve read this far, it will come as no surprise that I think the completed model is just fantastic. Both parts of the set look great, and the integration of the two is genius, with the TARDIS folding open and the console room lining up with the inside &ndash; perfectly representing the &ldquo;bigger on the inside than the outside&rdquo; feature. In order to allow the box to open, the logic behind having the Police Box signs printed across two tiles is revealed as they are mounted on hinges which rotate 90 degrees skywards and the hinges in the main structure can then fold outwards. This also means that the actual doors don&rsquo;t open, but again, this trade-off for scale and functionality is hardly a problem for an imaginative child, and is perfectly fine for adult collectors too!</p>

<p>Looking at this as a fan there are of course a number of things that aren&rsquo;t entirely faithful to the source material &ndash; there should be an additional row of panels on the exterior of the TARDIS (three rows, then the windows) and the arrangement of the concentric rings at the top of the time rotor hasn&rsquo;t quite been captured, but these are minor quibbles born of obsession,&nbsp;and needlessly fiddly accuracy isn&rsquo;t required when the results are this good. While the TARDIS isn&#39;t perfectly scaled to the minifigs, it is as near a perfect representation of the prop as can be made with Lego &ndash; and it&#39;s worth bearing in mind that not even the show has been consistent with the exterior over the past 52 years!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The arms holding the railings around the console area provide a somewhat rickety solution to that feature and are difficult to make symmetrical, but look great when in place.&nbsp;I like that each face of the console has its own discrete design, with the type and combination of elements placed on the 2x2 space on the top varying greatly. These are a combination of printed tiles and &lsquo;greebling&rsquo;, the best of the latter being the imaginative use of a zip line handle piece as a large old fashioned switch, which is entirely faithful to the prop on the show. Fitting with the established &lsquo;story&rsquo;, the colour theme of the console clearly reflects the final series of the Eleventh Doctor, but to change it to the vivid bright orange of Series 9 should take nothing more than a few carefully selected orders at the third party part seller of your choice (though not necessarily cheap!). The console room construction is surprisingly solid and can even be picked up and flow around (gently!) from the top of the time rotor without it all falling to bits.</p>

<p>The Daleks are as good as could be hoped for and somehow look far better in person than they do in any photos, so long as you don&rsquo;t look at them direct head on where the odd use of a 1x2 jumper plate makes the mid-section far too thin. They don&rsquo;t and can&rsquo;t emulate Ray Cusick&rsquo;s iconic design exactly due to scale, but I&rsquo;d far rather this brick-build solution than the use of any specialised pieces. The advantage of living in the internet ages is that there are numerous other solutions out there if this one doesn&rsquo;t quite satisfy.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to recreate the TARDIS in Lego form for the past thirty years (OK, so there was an 15 year gap while I sorted out dating, marriage and a mortgage, but still...) so to finally have an official version in my hands is a long held dream come true. I can only hope that it is popular enough for Lego to consider a larger range, though if that doesn&rsquo;t materialise then this will still remain as a wonderful standalone set, achieving the rare hat trick of being an interesting build, a good display piece and high in play value. Exceeding my expectations in every area, this was well worth the wait and I wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate to call it my set of the year.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A thing that looks like a police box, standing in a junkyard, it can move anywhere in time and space?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Yes&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;But that&rsquo;s ridiculous!&rdquo;</p>

"Professor_X","2016-01-20T19:19:32.467Z","""It's Bigger on the Inside""","<p>Doctor Who had been something I sort of new about from 1 or 2 friends and I always used to think of it as &quot;that British sci-fi thing that everyone&#39;s into.&quot; I started to pay a bit more attention however with all the LEGO Ideas hype about it, and when it reached 10,000 supporters and was eventually announced as the next Ideas product&nbsp;I wasn&#39;t particularly surprised(SO many LEGO fans are British!, I mean, even Huw and Captain Rex!). But when I saw the set images...man...I knew I had to have it. Reading Huw&#39;s review only made me more mad that I couldn&#39;t have RIGHT now and of course LEGO was irritating enough to release it in December when I&#39;m running around spending all my money on Christmas presents(just kidding by the way, I do like giving presents). Naturally, I put this on my own Christmas list, and when I unwrapped it I couldn&#39;t wait to finally build it! So, is this set a winner whether you&#39;re a Doctor Who fan or not? Or is it another over glorified collector&#39;s item that will only appeal to a certain niche. Read on to find out...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Build:</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lego Ideas and/or CUUSOO sets are such good quality products. The box is reusable and can be opened and closed for storage, which I think is a nice touch. The instructions feature short descriptions of the show, the characters, and even the set designers, along with little explanations and facts about the different things you&#39;re building along the way. The whole thing just screams quality, though the only thing that detracts from this is that since the bags aren&#39;t numbered, you have to dump out all the contents at once and all those pieces are kind of hard to sift through(this model is DENSE). Other than that little complaint though, building this set is a great experience and its nice to know you can get sets of this quality without having to fork over hundreds of dollars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Minifigures:</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The 12th Doctor</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Peter Capaldi): The 12th and current Doctor, while still recognizable, is a bit of a strange variation. While I&#39;m not a Doctor Who fan, I have done my research and have concluded that its very likely this whole set is loosely based on the episode, &quot;The Time of the Doctor.&quot; This episode is the first appearance of the 12th Doctor, and this appears to be the outfit he wears in that episode. Nonetheless, I really like the simplicity of this minifigures design: A purple coat over a navy vest over a white shirt, with a gold pocket watch visible as well. While I think that Dark red might have been a better color choice for the coat, the outfit still looks like something the Doctor would wear and so it doesn&#39;t bother me much. Oddly this minifigure doesn&#39;t have a reversible head, so the stern expression is the only one you&#39;re going to get. the Doctor&#39;s Hairpiece seemed at first to have been made especially for him, but after looking at the Peter Venkman minifigure from Ghostbusters, I assume that the hair was first made for him, then somebody thought it would look good on this minifigure and the Doctor happened to get produced first. While this hairpiece</p>

<p><a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=62810&amp;name=Minifig,%20Hair%20Short,%20Tousled%20with%20Side%20Part&amp;category=%5BMinifig,%20Hair%5D#T=C"">http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=62810&amp;name=Minifig,%20Hair%20Short,%20Tousled%20with%20Side%20Part&amp;category=%5BMinifig,%20Hair%5D#T=C</a></p>

<p>in light grey would probably have been a better choice, I like that the Doctor has a more unique hairpiece to set him apart and overall I really like this version of him.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The 11th Doctor (Matt Smith):</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Being some what of a fanatical minifigure collector, its very rare that I say that a minifgure is frighteningly accurate to the source material. This is one of the few times I must confess that this minifigure&#39;s resemblance is scary! It&#39;s all perfect: The jacket with a striped shirt and bow-tie, the expression on his face, that hair! It all looks so good! The only flaw is that the continued printing of the Doctor&#39;s jacket onto his legs is pretty faded, but this minifigure is so perfect I think I can live with that. His face has two expressions: serious with the hint of a smile, and out right laughing. The Doctor is armed with his trademark Sonic Screwdriver(an extra is included if you want to arm the 12th Doctor as well), and of course a fez. This minifigure is perfect, just perfect! If you&#39;re a minifigure collector this is one you should own.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Clara Oswald:</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Further proving my theory about this set being based on &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;, Clara Oswald is dressed in the outfit she wears in that episode. The black sweater and red skirt look very good together and the detail on her legs is especially impressive. Her legs are dual molded(top half black and bottom half red), and speaking as one who hadn&#39;t seen this before up close I&#39;m really glad LEGO is using that technique more. Clara&#39;s face is fairly generic, one side has a smiling expression and the other side has a confused look. Her hair is also pretty commonplace, reddish-brown draping over the right shoulder, and in my opinion is a very overused piece. while her head and hairpieces aren&#39;t as great as the other minifigures, I still think that Clara is recognizable enough to fit in with the others.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Weeping Angel:</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I first heard of Weeping Angels I didn&#39;t quite understand them, but having done some research I began to really love the concept. This Minifigure, like the 11th Doctor, is extremely accurate as well. Her simple dress is printed accurately and while her wings should probably be in a folded position, I happen to be a fan of these&nbsp;wings and was glad to get&nbsp;some. They are connected to her back via clips which are attached to the new see-through 2x1 neck bracket piece introduced in the DC Comics Super Heroes line. One side of her head is calm and serene, just like a normal statue should be, on the other side however...BAM! Possibly the most Frightening head in minifigure history contorted into a evil scream! The Weeping Angel&#39;s hair piece is typically used for queen minifigures, and this is its first appearance in light grey which I believe will be useful for making minifigures of a certain female monarch. My only complaint about this minifigure...We don&#39;t get more! I think that this minifigures amazing detail will demand a high price from the secondary market and it&#39;s definitely become a favorite of mine</p>

<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>The Completed Set:</h2>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>TARDIS Console Room:</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The TARDIS Console room, while not the most prolific version, is instantly recognizable. Another piece of evidence that this set is inspired by the episode, &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;, this Console Room appears to based on the version appearing during the late 11th doctor-early 12th doctor era, which I think is a good version to base it on considering that this set features both. If you love control panels like I do, this set is a dream come true. Over ten 2x1 control panel pieces are used all over as well several transparent studs, an exclusive printed 2x4 round plate, and 2 printed clip on square pieces representing computer screens. While The console area itself is a bit bulky, it&#39;s variety of controls look amazing and while the whole thing is designed very simply it&#39;s a very excellent representation of the source material. The room itself is simple enough, with some large bar pieces representing the railing mounted with more control panels, some simple stairs attached to a ladder piece, and a small platform attached to a Technique pin that can lock into the TARDIS Model. The console room, on the whole, is excellent, providing a stunning display model as well as something that&#39;s fun to play with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Daleks:</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Daleks are probably Doctor Who&#39;s most prominent antagonists, and were of course an essential for this set. Most likely based on the Daleks currently seen on screen, these Daleks are mostly dark tan in color with a little bit of gold thrown in around the top. While not perfect, I think the Daleks are recreated well and are pretty consistent wit the source material. While they appear to be simple builds, they actually include some interesting parts such as the new see-through stud with nipple piece and their new printed dome pieces. exposed studs around their bottoms of course create the texturing of the Daleks shells very accurately and their respective suction-like arms and weapon arms are recreated pretty well. I really like how the head is constructe, putting to good use&nbsp; the 2x1 round plate with a hole in the center attached to the dome piece via a nunchuk handle. While I&#39;m a bigger fan of the LEGO Dimensions Daleks, these are still accurate representations that I sure will be sought after by Doctor Who fans for army building(I mean, who doesn&#39;t want an army of LEGO Daleks. EXTERMINATE!).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The TARDIS</h3>

<p><br />
The most legendary phone booth in the world, The TARDIS has become a huge sci-fi icon as well as something several builders have tried to recreate. Now, at long last, LEGO has made one in a set and it couldn&#39;t be better. If you&#39;re a fan of dark blue, this model is now your best friend. The amount of useful dark blue pieces here is&nbsp;amazing, from your basic plates, to your printed pieces, to even small windows and window panes used to recreate the TARDIS&#39; outside paneling. One of the coolest things about this model is its use in creating the &quot;bigger on the inside effect&quot; of the TARDIS by allowing it to hook up to the console room. By removing the roof, flipping the top panels up on the left and right sides, and then opening up the back a small interior can be seen, which includes details like the white mirror image of the door and the blue and orange circular lights which can be seen all around the interior in the show. One then only needs to hook up the TARDIS via a Technique pin to the rest of the set, and it recreates a full out, believable TARDIS interior. This model isn&#39;t perfect, mostly because of the fact that its humongous&nbsp;compared to &nbsp;minifigures, but other than that I think its one of the most accurate LEGO models I&#39;ve seen in a set in a long time and its ability to attach to the console room is a great feature</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>&nbsp; I&#39;m not even a Doctor Who fan, and now I&#39;m really interested in the show! This set is such a high quality product, from the minifigures, to the amount of printed pieces, to even the quality of the building instructions. While some may look at this and think it&#39;s a little small for a $69.99 CA/$59.99 US set, not only is a surprisingly dense but you&#39;re paying for a set that&#39;s been made with all kinds of little details to delight hardcore LEGO fans and Doctor Who fans alike. If you love Doctor Who, get this set. If you love LEGO, get this set. If you have $70 that you don&#39;t know how to spend, get this set. Trust me, you won&#39;t be disappointed (I may just have to go and binge watch some Doctor Who on Netflix!)</p>

"HdmLegoLad","2016-04-05T02:58:02.597Z","The Doctor Is In!","<p>Good Evening,Whovians and Lego fans alike! Let us rejoice in the combination of Lego and Doctor Who! This is the Lego set made by Whovians for Whovians! When Andrew Clark Introduced this set on Lego Ideas I knew this was the set I wanted! Months later,I got&nbsp;it as a gift from my aunt and I built it in an hour and 45&nbsp;minutes.Without further ado,let us travel into the blue box that&#39;s bigger on the inside,Allon-Sy!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>On the box there is a wonderful image of the set itself and in the corner there is an image of the Eleventh Doctor and Weeping Angel minifigures,and in the center is the set itself,with a grouchy looking Twelfth Doctor played the wonderful Peter Capaldi,with an unsure Clara running in the TARDIS&nbsp;Console,Two menacing Dalek&#39;s&nbsp;are also seen looking menacingly at the duo! The back offers the same details as the front,and shows info on Lego Ideas.Com, The instructions as all others are easy to follow and even featured bios on the characters and the Police Box itself! It also has a bio on Andrew Clark himself,and an ad for the Lego Dimensions Level Pack also available with the Twelfth Doctor,K-9 and the Police Box.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>We get lots of printed parts,such as the window panes,Police box signage,St Johns ambulance badge,&quot;Pull to Open&quot;door sign,and the doors itself with the panes and lock on the door.We also get the printed pieces to resemble the bits and bobs of the console,and printed parts for the Dalek&#39;s&nbsp;domes.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Minifigures include the Twelfth Doctor in Elevens clothes,Clara in her clothing from &quot;The Time of the Doctor&quot;,The Eleventh Doctor,in his Seasons 5-7A&nbsp;clothes with the trademark bow tie and tweed coat,A menacing Weeping Angel with giant wings attached to a special clip on the back,and two brick built Daleks,with the exterminator ray and the plunger.For accessories The Doctors come with Sonic Screwdrivers and two are included,as in series 8-9,the Twelfth Doctor uses Elevens after he regenerates.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building the set may be a bit challenging for younger builders,as the console can be a bit repetitive,and the bags aren&#39;t numbered,which may be a bit challenging,so color coding the bricks may be easier.However,for older fans building may be faster,and it should take some 1 1/2 to 2 hours.The instructions were very clear,and it was a joy building my very own time machine,I just wish the chameleon circuit would be fixed!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The complete model is gorgeous and was so much fun to build! Although I love applying the stickers,the printed pieces are a lot more convenient.Overall there&#39;s lots of detail,I think it&#39;s cool how the the Police Box itself can actually open,and it could be clipped in to make the TARDIS&nbsp;bigger on the inside! I also like how the lever on the console can actually be pulled down to feel as though the TARDIS&nbsp;is powering up! The only complaint I have is that I wish there were alternative bricks,so you can either make the Elevenths TARDIS&nbsp;from season 7B,or orange blades and clear bricks to make the Twelfths TARDIS.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In the end,I feel this set is perfect for any Whovian&nbsp;who loves Lego or Doctor Who! I do like how it can be played with,even with the lack of play features. I also wish the bags were numbered,so building wouldn&#39;t be too challenging.Besides that I think this set is by far my favorite in my growing collection of Legos,and I thank Andrew Clark for making this set a reality with Legos! In the words of the Ninth Doctor this set is just &quot;Fantastic!&quot;Until next time this was my opinon&nbsp;on the Lego Ideas Doctor Who set, Geronimoooooo!</p>

But as a Minifigure she looks cute, with her dual-molded legs and fun skirt print and her tight looking black sweater. She too comes with a dual-sided facial print with a happy and angry expression, her hair has been seen many times before though and she isn&rsquo;t given any accessories.</span></span></span></span></p>

I know I can&rsquo;t be the only one who wants to see Barbara or Amy or any number of other fun and iconic characters from the Doctor Who universe.</span></span></span></span></p>

EXTERMINATE! Two of the iconic enemies of the Doctor are built-up with bricks in this set, there are printed head plates, however that&rsquo;s the only printed piece. The rest is built by bricks and tiles and two new eyestalk pieces and they both look great.</span></span></span></span></p>

The print detailing is just as good here as it is on his Thirteenth counterpart. He gets his own sonic as well, due to the fact that you get two in the set, and he also has a Fez.</span></span></span></span></p>

Happy Smith, Serious Smith, also since the hair piece isn&rsquo;t underneath the Fez he comes off as an odd two-faced bald Janus or something. But he&rsquo;s still an excellent addition for the set and at least you have two Doctor&rsquo;s in this iteration.</span></span></span></span></p>

He&rsquo;s dressed in Matt Smith&rsquo;s last outfit and so you can swap heads to recreate the iconic scene in play sessions or brick films. Holding the new sonic accessory and featuring a unique new hair piece Doctor Thirteen looks brilliant, the only downside is his lack of a double-sided face. He has only one expression, but his attack eyebrows are completely intact for this little Minifigure.</span></span></span></span></p>

We&rsquo;ve had monsters before in other Themes, but the Weeping Angel is one of the most terrifying creatures that Doctor has had to face in his many travels and this Minifigure captures that quite perfectly.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s so cute too for a little abomination of horror. The print is excellent and the parts are perfect, the double-sided face reveals a horrible secret though for all your other Minifigures. She&rsquo;s ready to devour their entire lifespan in time. The only downside is you only get one, LEGO needs to make some Weeping Angel battle packs somehow.</span></span></span></span></p>

Even I, an AFOL, had some difficulty in getting the top satellite dish pieces to line up and attach properly without applying too much force. The control consoles attached to the rods on either side of the central area were somewhat annoying to line up properly as well, since LEGO did not introduce the new flexible rods yet in models of this type.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The stairs like to move a lot as well, for a small three step ladder it is a bit finicky. And I recall several moments of fidgeting to get the floor panels for the upper control section to attack to the lower portion of the under carriage. It&rsquo;s still quite satisfying once you complete the model though, however I feel the true charm of this set is when you&rsquo;re building the next model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Tardis: This is wholly satisfying. It may not be 100% to scale, but it works with Minifigures and the build, while slightly repetitive in certain steps due to the nature of building a rectangular box resembling an old British Police Public Call Box, it&rsquo;s so much fun. A lot more fun than when you had to build the interior of the control area.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Every step adds to the overall model and by the time you complete the upper roof section and seal it off you marvel at the design and the SNOT techniques in use to minimize the presence of standard LEGO studs on the outside for attaching elements. I found myself having a lot more fun with this model than the larger one, perhaps because of the fact that it was so much simpler to deal with and follow along.</span></span></span></span></p>

The printed detailing is superbly executed and the model can even open up on hinges so you can fit a Minifigure inside. It doesn&rsquo;t open the doors as you would expect, you need to pop the top off and flip some hinged portions to allow the Tardis to open. However I do think it&rsquo;s very impressive.</span></span></span></span></p>

This model is perfect for play as well, not just a display piece, but an excellent LEGO model to use in Brickfilms, or just have fun spinning around and around through the time vortex as The Doctor and Companion rush off into adventure after adventure.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Interior of the Tardis: This is basically the central control area for the Tardis as seen with the Eleventh and Twelfth Doctors (or Twelve and Thirteen if you prefer conventional accuracy with your numbering) and it is a semi-decent display model. I honestly don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the best that could be add, but I do know that it includes all printed elements, no stickers at all.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Some of this build, from what I can recall, was very problematic in getting together. The placement of the railings on the side, the top of the central control shaft and some of the finicky bits to affix the consoles in their proper placement lead to a true 10+ recommendation for the building here. That being said the model itself is quite nice, it works well sitting on any shelf for the interior of the command area of the Tardis. It can fit three Minifigures without issue and attaches to the Tardis model as noted before so that you can display everything as one continuous piece.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I do wish the attachment for the steps was handled more securely, the simple ladder/scaffolding piece used for the base of the tree floating steps leading down further into the Tardis is very lose. If you find yourself moving the model around a lot to dust and alter how it is displayed or where it is displayed this piece will start to flop around quite easily and become very unstable.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s certainly up there as one of the better offerings, if slightly flawed in some of the build techniques. I love the Tardis and the Minifigures and the interior control area is a suitable display base for a decent Doctor Who display. I would hope that LEGO might see more value in giving us further sets from this Theme similar to how Minecraft took off, but that remains to be seen. There aren&rsquo;t too many things iconic enough to be built in LEGO and most of what fans want are Minifigures of all the Doctors and their Companions/Allies with a few more Enemies.</span></span></span></span></p>

The police box closed looks really good all&nbsp; around.&nbsp;It&#39;s&nbsp;cool how the tardis can be opened and attached to the console, which looks decent. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>This set is a great set and is pretty accurate to the tv show. If you are a doctor who fan then you will love this set. All of the minifigures look great and the whole set looks good. I&nbsp;have no problems with this set, everything works well. It&#39;s a fun set to build and display.</p>
