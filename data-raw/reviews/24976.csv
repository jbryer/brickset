"joeymeluso","2015-12-20T00:39:31.873Z","A Great Add-on for any City Fan","<p>In the early wave of sets I obtained from the LEGO City 2016 line, this was the smallest yet one of the most interesting to me. It seemed like more of a build than previous LEGO City sets in this&nbsp;price range, so I tried it out early in my 2016 set building spree. On top of that, this is my first written review for Brickset, after many years of publishing my&nbsp;YouTube video reviews to the site.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is small enough to pack all the pieces. The instructions were easy to comprehend as expected.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There aren&#39;t many unique parts to this set, but a few good ones considering the price. The fire slope on the front of the ATV is printed, which makes it easier for kids building the set and not have to fuss about stickers. The pieces for the window and profile brick assembly is more interesting, since those are two things you can&#39;t have enough of.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure seems a little less than special considering the recycled outfit. The new printing in the face makes it much better. A similar version of another face used many times in the past, but with a lighter color on the facial hair and some additional grey details around the face. I presume it&#39;s from the debris this firefighter works with when fighting fires? It&#39;s hard to make sense of it when his oxygen mask is on. Otherwise, the face can be reused for other jobs such as construction worker, auto mechanic or chef, but it is limited by the grey printing and asks of your imagination to explain why it&#39;s there.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The ATV has a neat and sturdy build. The blue and yellow colors blend well into the model to show where the minifigure can sit, without taking away from the main red, white and light grey/dark grey color scheme. The burning window, on the other hand, is sturdy and does the bare minimum for the play feature. It lacks in realism, unless the building is already burned to a crisp. Or the window can act as a fireman&#39;s simulation while training in the fire department. Either way, very few pieces involved for the window build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The ATV is a great short vehicle for quick emergencies. It has sirens and the red printed slope to signify it it a fire department vehicle, but even better is how it stores up to two tools using minifigure clip-sized plates on the back. A simple yet useful play feature. The wheels roll well, but compared to standard cars in LEGO City, they may seem big for this vehicle. It still delivers the off-road feel of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The window has a simple play feature used from previous Fire sets: a lever on the side can lift the flame pieces to make the scene appear to be on fire. After situating the minifigure&nbsp;with an extinguisher in front of the window, the lever can pull the flames down to make the fire look extinguished. It uses the bare minimum of pieces to create the illusion but it&#39;s still effective.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is a great entry-level set for someone getting into LEGO or even LEGO City. One can understand the basics of building a stationary and a mobile model, while also experimenting with different play features. Technic is gently used in the set with the window fire, to give a taste of what some pieces can do outside of studs-on-studs building. The minifigure is good for the set, but will blend in easily with the fire figures already made due to the uniform. This set can be an okay&nbsp;addition for advanced builders, as it gives them a short and easy vehicle for their collection, but also an added window to their buildings. Price wise, this set is good to pick up - a little more than a polybag set, in terms of value and cost.</p>

"NBJ2016","2015-12-28T18:34:40.463Z","60105: City Fire Brigade: Fire ATV","<p>Fire ATV sets have been around for years, the first of which (in minifig-scale) was <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6611-1/Fire-Chief-s-Car"">6611</a>,* in 1981. The predecessor of this ATV was the one included in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60088-1/Fire-Starter-Set"">60088</a>, and yet one year later, TLG have suddenly produced a much better one, which is a first for the City theme.</p>

<p><u><strong>Box and Instruction Manual</strong></u></p>

<p>The box depicts the firefighter attempting to put out a tiny fire in the window of a non-existent ruined house in a deserted country lane. The sides shout out all the usual warnings, and the top shows off the 1:1 real-size image.</p>

<p>The instruction manual is as unchanged as ever, and can be downloaded <a href=""https://wwwsecure.us.lego.com/en-us/service/buildinginstructions/search#?search&amp;text=60105%2520Fire%2520ATV%2520City%2520Fire"">here</a>.</p>

<p><u><strong>Parts selection</strong></u></p>

<p>The parts selection is pretty good, with a few interesting parts. The most interesting parts in this set are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bright Red: Bion. Eye.</li>
	<li>Bright Red: Mudguard 2x4.</li>
	<li>Bright Red: Plate W. Bow 2x2x2/3 (with 2013 Fire Brigade print).</li>
	<li>Bright Red: Racers Guard 2,5 x 4.</li>
</ul>

<p>The set is very good value if you&#39;re a MOCer, with each part costing only 7.8p (UK) / 10.9c (US).</p>

<p><u><strong>Minifigure</strong></u></p>

<p>The single minifigure included in this set is a normal firefighter. The lack of a crash helmet is slightly odd, given that every modern City ATV / motorcycle driver wears one, but I can&#39;t say I care, as white fire helmets are a lot less common. The head has a new print, and appears in some of the other Fire Brigade 2016 sets. The torso and legs are the same as the ones used on the 2013 firefighter minifigures.</p>

<p><u><strong>The building process</strong></u></p>

<p>The building process is extremely simple, and takes less than five minutes, as is to be expected for a set of this size. The minifigure is constructed first, then the ruin**, and finally the ATV.</p>

<p><u><strong>The completed models</strong></u></p>

<p>I don&#39;t really like the ruin just as it is, as it feels extremely small and unnecessary for a normal City layout, unless you have some of the 2015 Demolition sets, which give the whole set a large boost in terms of play value. The &#39;extinguishing&#39; function can be activated by turning the &#39;Bion. Eye&#39; attached on the left-hand side.</p>

<p>The ATV is excellent, and is a vast improvement over last year&#39;s model. It looks sturdy, suitable for off-road emergencies, and is a really nice, sleek model. Both tools can be stored on the back, and so there&#39;s little chance of accessories getting lost when in storage.</p>

<p><u><strong>Overall</strong></u><u><strong> opinion</strong></u></p>

<p>TLG&#39;s previous attempt failed, but this model is greatly improved, and, for the price, is excellent value. I can&#39;t see a lot of fans liking this if they haven&#39;t got a City layout with a construction / demolition area, but it&#39;s a nice little set, and easily the best Fire Brigade ATV that has been released so far.</p>

<p><em>* I know it&#39;s classified as &quot;Fire Chief&#39;s Car&quot;, but the model is what many fans call an ATV, so I&#39;m going with that.</em></p>

<p><em>* * That&#39;s what TLG calls it, so...</em></p>
