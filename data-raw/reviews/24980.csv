A lot of Digital Media if it doesn&rsquo;t include any brick elements or is sold directly through the LEGO Online Shop will not be catalogued by Brickset from what I recall of the policy in regards this type of product.</p>

<p>That being said, I am posting this review here because the first two discs included in this set is listed on Brickset and discussing all three specials in a single review makes sense to me. Posting it under the two DVDs that is on Brickset should let folks make an informed decision based on the two different offerings of the product.</p>

<p>To differentiate the two reviews text I will add this to review number two. LEGO Friends DVDs in any form are difficult to find on the secondary market, many retailers no longer supply these older releases. Even this triple feature DVD was difficult to come by. That being said, do try to find any of them if you are a fan of LEGO Animation.</p>

<p><b>Presentation</b></p>

<p>Packaged in a generic three-in-one DVD case, the package truncates the unique artwork and write-ups of each of the three &lsquo;films&rsquo; included in this set. Each disc runs 66 minutes and features three individual episodes of the LEGO Friends original Television/Netflix series.</p>

<p>All three discs look quite nice, each one includes some trailers/previews of other LEGO Television series such as Ninjago and Chima. Other than that there are no special features and no commercials for LEGO Friends products.</p>

<p><b>Minifigures</b></p>

<p>None of these discs came with bonus Minifigures so the triple feature version has nothing to build, just the nine episodes to watch.</p>

<p><b>Contents</b></p>

<p>Friends are Forever: This disc features New Girl in Town, Stephanie&rsquo;s Surprise Party and Dolphin Cruise. All three of which are the first three episodes of the original LEGO Friends Cartoon as seen first aired on Disney XD/Family Channel in Canada. Also according to the internet is the entire first season of LEGO Friends&rsquo; original television series. Who knew?</p>

<p>All three episodes are very well done, it can be a tad unusual to watch the stylized animated characters interacting with LEGO elements, as the three specials do feature the physical sets, but the Mini-Dolls in digital form do not match the look of a Mini-Doll. The faces are more defined and more animated, and they have regular hands. Compared to the LEGO DC Super Hero Girls specials which animated the sets and Mini-Dolls in digital form, similar to other LEGO Television series. This serves to make this animation project more unique.</p>

<p>This means that you won&rsquo;t see the Friends remove their hair or do other things that you might see&nbsp;in LEGO Scooby-Doo or LEGO Ninjago. Instead you&rsquo;ll see them attaching bricks together to build an item.</p>

<p>Friends Together Again: The next three episodes are included on this disc. Also known as Season Two, Country Girls, Emma&rsquo;s Dilemma and Friends of the Jungle. All three specials are very well done and the scripts are nice, each of the episodes have featured a lot of the sets and sub-themes of the LEGO Friends Theme allowing you to play along with the adventures with your LEGO toys. If you&rsquo;re so inclined.</p>

<p>Friends Always Together: Was the third single disc release from Warner Brothers and includes the three episodes of Season Three. Andrea&rsquo;s Big Moment, Kate&rsquo;s Island and The Grand Hotel.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see that this animation project featured so few episodes compared to the seasons of LEGO Ninjago, Legends of Chima or other LEGO Television projects, but each episode is very well animated, the plots are extremely enjoyable to watch, even for this AFOL and you can see the sets in action as many of the LEGO Friends sets from the long years of the original look for LEGO Friends are featured in some fashion with these episodes.</p>

<p><b>Overall opinion</b></p>

<p>Originally released as individual discs, it is strongly considered that this three-in-one re-release from 2017 is much better to track down than the individual disc releases on the secondary market. LEGO Friends&rsquo; animated projects are very well done. I honestly prefer the original CGI animation style compared to the cell-shaded animation that the LEGO Friends Reboot used.</p>

<p>This animation style fits more with the LEGO Ninjago and other CGI Cartoons LEGO primarily focused on at the time and you can actually see physical models re-imagined in CGI watching the toys come to life. The newer LEGO Friends Television show may have a decent storyline or good animation, but they fail on showcasing the sets in a digital medium that appears to be blocky, brick-built sets brought to life.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d strongly recommend picking up this three-in-one feature if you can to enjoy watching the original storyline of the LEGO Friends.</p>
