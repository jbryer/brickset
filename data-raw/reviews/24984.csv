"tmgm528","2016-06-08T20:31:14.693Z","The Armies of Evil Arrive In...Buggies?","<p>As I was wandering through a local Target the itch to pick up something from the Nexo Knights theme grew strong, and while the box art and promotional images haven&#39;t done enough to woo me into delving into this theme quite yet, I couldn&#39;t resist picking up this set for a mere $3.50. Is this set a decent polybag for its price? Read on!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>About what you would expect for a polybag. The bag consists of the pictureof the set and attempts to capture your attention. The instructions are clear enough too and obviously there were no issues with them.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For such a small set there are actually some rather interesting/useful parts here! The neon orange pieces which seem to litter the Nexo Knights sets are always a nice addition, and the helmet, golden horn,&nbsp;sword, and catapult pieces aren&#39;t overly common.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set contains one minifigure&nbsp;from the evil side of things and he&#39;s splendid. The printing is wonderful on the body and legs, and I was quite impressed by printing on the back of the head as well, especially considering a helmet is covering it most of the time!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not much exactly can be said about this like most any polybag as it&#39;s fast and simple. No crazy techniques of note to be mentioned either.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Perhaps my biggest gripe with this set is the finished product. The vehicle&#39;s fine &nbsp;and contains decent enough playability with the catapults, however the model itself is just a bit bizarre. Minus the catapults nothing in its design screams medieval, however nothing is exactly futuristic either. It&#39;s simply a bizarre little...car thing. Though for a set under $5 there isn&#39;t much to complain about.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Tis&#39; an odd little polybag but I&#39;d say it still manages to be good! The set itself is a bit odd, but the design is alright, playability is there, some interesting pieces for the price, and the figure is astounding. Whether you&#39;re looking to build up your evil army, or simply curious to give Nexo Knights a taste this set is very good. I must say it&#39;s convinced me to explore Nexo Knights further!&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set comes in a polybag with normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get a few nice parts in this set. You get the two dark brown catapults and two trans orange vents, and three trans orange cones. The brown and dark brown pieces were nice to get as well. The total piece count for the set is 40. Overall a fairly decent piece haul.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Crust Smasher:</strong></p>

<p>The Crust Smasher is a pretty simple figure. He has a black knight helmet. He has a single sided head. He has yellow eyes and an angry facial expression. On the back of the head there are darker maroon circles on it. The torso has printing on both sides of it. On the front of it you have printing of abs and pecks. On both sides he has maroon circles as well. He has printing on his legs with a chain, and tattered black cloth, maroon circles, and claws on his feet. He is armed with a stone sword.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice Nexo Knight polybag. The build itself is pretty nice. It has a primitive feel to it (which works well with the figure). You have a play feature in the two catapults that launch trans orange cones. You have a red lever used to control it. It rolls smoothly across hard surfaces nicely. The figure is pretty simple with some nice detail done with the printing. I recommend this set to any Nexo Knight fan. If you are a fan of Nexo Knight this isn&#39;t a must-have but can still be nice to addition to anyones Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
