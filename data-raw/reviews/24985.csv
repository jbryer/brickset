<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>No box but a fairly sizeable bag with fold-out instructions. Nothing much to be said here but they do the job nicely.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There&#39;s a great selection of parts here. you have the 2 palm leafs which never go amiss, the 2x2 tiles in bright pink and medium azure are nice. The clear goblet and the 4x4 rounded plates with holes are all great. The crab is a nice addition too. There&#39;s also 6 spares which are of the usual variety - rounded plates, the lever and base and spares for Olaf, which knowing my daughter she will lose them most promptly.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>A single minifigure - Olaf. He&#39;s a brick-built figure with a custom moulded head&nbsp; which captures his face perfectly. Overall a great figure.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>I&#39;ll probably dismantle the whole thing so my daughter can make it but it&#39;s fairly simple and nicely put together. 2 minutes to put together, probably 10 minutes for a little kid.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>According to the information, there&#39;s 41 pieces which I believe excludes the individual parts of Olaf. For this amount it&#39;s a lovely model which you can&#39;t really fault (ok, you could but why....) There&#39;s not a huge amount of play in the set but saying that, I can see my daughter singing the song while playing so the play factor is for kids.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For kids, especially those who are fans of the movie, this will go down a storm. For me, I got it for free and I was ordering anyway, it has nice parts and it&#39;s a nice little set as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks LEGO for a lovely little set.</p>

It looks good and the models are a solid build, even Olaf can be fun to play with, if you haven&rsquo;t gotten any of the other Frozen sets it&rsquo;s also a very cheap method for getting him. There is sadly not too much to do with him though, he can lounge on the beach listening to the radio or float around in his little floaty. I would suggest this makes a better companion piece for other sets, still it is worth tracking down and I definitely recommend it for Frozen fans.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Good parts for a small set, however the Olaf figure is now very outdated. The building experience was ok. The price is great for what&#39;s included. The playability is meh.</p>

<p>Olafs summer time fun a great polybag for play , the amount of stuff and the price .</p>

<p>The Minifigures-</p>

<p>The figure has a very nice moulded head with an orange unicorn horn for a carrot nose , his body is built around a 1&times;1 white snot brick with Townsend and a lump of coal connected and the feet is just one 2&times;2 white dome .</p>

<p>The builds-</p>

<p>The small inflatable boat is not bad and fits olaf in easily and has the suggestion of an animal head on the front . The bed and umbrella are also nice residing in a 4&times;4 light tan plate , the bed is tiled off nicely and the umbrella is a two piece build also there is a glass along with a bottle off some sort and a radio with an antenna . The final build is the biggest as it is on a 6&times;8 plate there is a suggestion of sand at the bottom of the tree which is a dry nice build the waves are very well recreated with three 2&times;2 tiles and three 1&times;1 trans light blue studs .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is one of my favourite polybags as I feel as if it has something for everyone and so much stuff in general .</p>
