It is a sweet small build with 105 pieces and fits perfectly in your LEGO city of any sort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box and instructions show a nice park setting with a lady feeding her dog a cookie while she reads the LEGO newspaper. A tall BLEY&nbsp;figure with large pearl gold wings sits atop a cute fountain that should enhance any LEGO scene. There are two four stud long park benches, a dark red trash bin and a lime planter with flowers next to the benches. Her BLO bike is nearby.</p>

<p>The parts and minifigs look like standard fare; not much new there except maybe the trans backpack holder where the wings are mounted on the back of the statue (part 6100958.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a simple build that takes about two minutes and looks instantly adorable. It makes you want to hug the fountain, the dog and the lady....that is how cute it is. There are countless ways to incorporate this into anything you are building. &nbsp;(And we all love chilling out at a park. On rainy days, you can pretend you are sitting on that bench!)</p>

<p>The design is quite nice being compact and yet expandable to fit whatever scene you build. &nbsp;Add some of her friends and family, and you have an instant picnic in the park. &nbsp;A couple of soccer balls and you have an instant match. &nbsp;And don&#39;t forget the other plants and trees, food and drink, and pets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is lovely because it is quite&nbsp;adaptable and so darn cute. With huge&nbsp;playability, it ranks high on my list. Thanks, LEGO, for such a perfect gift. This is one you will not want to miss.</p>

"UKBRiCKS","2016-06-03T10:29:17.513Z","Great colour bike and interchangeable statue, nice! ","<p>This was a giveaway promotion from June 2016&nbsp;with purchases over &pound;50 in the UK and $75 in the US.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We have seen a similar statue in one of the City Square sets from a couple of years back but<br />
this fountain can be used quite easily in LEGO city and Town displays and would look very<br />
effective without the need for customisation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a closer look at what is included in this set. The fountain has some nice water<br />
elements which stick up to demonstrate the water feature. Around the sides there is detailing<br />
with 4 of the gold frogs which I think look very good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The statue is similar to what we have seen before but I do like the golden wings on the back.<br />
One thing I didn&#39;t know about the set before building it is the statue can be changed out for a<br />
Female version, so currently we are seeing the Male version complete with Helmet, Beard and&nbsp;Sword and when you switch out those elements and replace them with Female hair piece and Flag&nbsp;pole and golden flag. I really like they have included these extra elements, particularly the&nbsp;grey hair piece something that is less common.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another great feature in this set is the bike in the new colour, the Yellowish Orange which we<br />
have only seen in one other set before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course we have seen this dog before with this print and is pretty common but again nice to<br />
get in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set also comes with not one but two dark blue park benches which are four studs wide, you&nbsp;can just about fit 2 minifigures on these if you balance them however only one fits on their&nbsp;comfortably but next to the benches you have a pot plant and flowers on one side and a dustbin&nbsp;for your rubbish on the other side.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifig</h3>

<p>We get one minifigure in this set (excluding the statue) which comes with the press pass torso&nbsp;which is always a handy one to get. The face is standard as we get with all LEGO creator sets&nbsp;and the yellow hair piece is pretty standard. She comes with a cookie and the LEGO news tile piece.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I quite like this set, probably more so because it is free LEGO however that asside it is a set I would pay &pound;5 for so I think it is almost big enough and good enough to be a set in its own right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Getting the new colour bike for free without having to purchase in the LEGO Friends set or off bricklink is very good and the interchangable statue is a nice touch.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Score</h3>

<p>I would give this a respectable 72 / 100. There is nothing wrong with this set as it is free LEGO. Perhaps they could have included a couple of LEGO coins to make it a &#39;Wish Fountain&#39;</p>

"indykid","2020-08-14T21:49:16.49Z","Great addition to any LEGO City","<p>I recently got this for free after redeeming some VIP points for it on&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.lego.com"">LEGO.com</a>. It&#39;s a neat little set and the price (free or at least some VIP points) really sweetened the deal.</p>

<p>The build is nothing special but all the parts are great, especially everything included with the fountain. The customizability is a plus. I know the instructions have 2 options for the fountain statue but there&#39;s room to mix and match, especially since the set comes with an extra sword piece. The pearl gold frogs and all the trans blue elements are great. The blue benches are a fun and different color. The trash bin has a super simple yet really effective design. The reporter minifig is good; I collect modulars but I don&#39;t own&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10224-1/Town-Hall"">Town Hall</a>&nbsp;yet so she&#39;s a welcome addition, especially as I am partial to the classic minifig heads in the modular series. The yellow bike is also really cool.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a fair amount of room for playability but it works better when combined with other sets. I know it&#39;s supposed to be a companion piece for the modular series (or at least that&#39;s what the advertising on the instruction booklet implies) but it would fit in great with any City theme set as well.</p>

"Hylocera","2016-06-20T03:04:44.363Z","It's FREE","<p>The title pretty much sums up all I need to say in this review: FREE. LEGO. But, if you want to know more about this &quot;free LEGO&quot; and see&nbsp;pictures,&nbsp;read on...</p>

<h3>Box/Contents</h3>

<p>Nothing special here. Typical square box used for $10 sets, with an instruction booklet folded in half and 2 bags inside: 1 for small parts, and&nbsp;1 for&nbsp;big(ger) parts.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/8/7429/27171742664_77d48d9645_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Goodness this is a good parts pack. It&#39;s pretty much everything you can see: pearl gold frogs, yellow-orange bike, lime green inverted dome, grass stalk with 6 branches, etc. The only things you can&#39;t really see&nbsp;are the trans-clear neck bracket for mounting the statue&#39;s wings, and a 6x6 round medium azure plate on the base of the fountain.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Here&#39;s where it starts to get a little ridiculous.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7523/27749211186_bddb5d6b3d_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Ok, so the lady has a plain smiley face. Whatever. Her torso with the press nametag comes in 5 other sets, the cheapest of which is $40 (the other options are $50, $60, $150, and $200). Needless to say, if you want this torso and other good pieces, this is easily the best option. She has a cookie and a printed (PRINTED) 2x2 white tile with a newspaper design. Admittedly, this piece appears in 16 other sets, but it is a nice addition regardless. As nice as this fig is, what really impresses me is the statue.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7605/27171736074_30ff2e3765_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The statue has plain light bley legs, torso, and head; the torso has dark bley hands, which is unfortunate, but it&#39;s barely noticeable. The helmet is rare-ish in light bley. What&#39;s amazing is that this isn&#39;t the only statue you can make. LEGO could have just left it at this knight guy with wings (before I forget; the golden wings are a bit distracting from the bley color scheme). But instead, they included a hairpiece that you can switch out with the helmet and a flag (not pictured) that you can switch out with, or add to, the sword. Fantastic feature, especially for a promotional.</p>

<p>Oh and there&#39;s a dog.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not much here.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Since this is a free set, the criteria of value and all that changes a little bit. It&#39;s obviously not &quot;value for money&quot;. IMHO, it becomes &quot;does it justify spending $75?&quot; The answer?</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c3.staticflickr.com/8/7598/27749207426_64e548a31c_c.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Yes. Absolutely, yes. It is worth it. The above picture shows the set in its entirety, plus 6 extras. I would spend $15 on this as a normal set, just for all the rare parts and pretty colors, but for free? :)</p>

It&rsquo;s a double-sided print with a red suit jacket, an ID badge clipped on to one side and a black undershirt visible beneath. She gets The LEGO News accessory tile and a printed cookie element.</span></span></span></span></p>

The bench sections are fairly repetitive, the differences is the trash can on one plate and the flower planter on the other. The fountain itself is a much more satisfying build, the fact that you use Chima crystals for water effects is very clever and the four pearl gold frog decorations add to the ambiance of the model, if that makes sense.</span></span></span></span></p>

Building the small waste basket next to the bench is the only irritant, there are four grate style elements used to attach to a four-sided headlight style brick and the clutch power is definitely weaker because of this. It does make for a very nice detailed element though as we&rsquo;ll discuss in the next section.</span></span></span></span></p>
