"Beast76","2016-04-04T13:57:14.96Z","Critical note...","<p>The time was finally there to go and get this modular building. I was very excited as always.</p>

<p>Well. it&#39;s Lego. It&#39;s lovely. It fits in great with the other modular buildings. We all know this and we don&#39;t need to review that.</p>

<p>But while i was building this set a few things sprung to mind.</p>

<p>The ground floor: Super detailed, nice pattern on the floor. Some great detail on the safe and the register. Love the printed windows and the ornament above the entrance. The wall between the laundromat and the bank safe, is quit genius. The only thing that bothered me was the general lack of color. It&#39;s all very grey an gloomy. And what&#39;s with the gap in the wall between the side of the laundromat and the bank? Not very burglar proof.</p>

<p>The upper level, i think, is a bit on the boring side. The black and white interior is a bit boring. Okay there&#39;s a desk and a coffee machine and an office for the bank Manager. but it is not all that detailed. There is a large chimney from which the robbers can enter the bank&#39;s safe area, but I&nbsp; think that is a complete waste of space and bricks. The windows look great though.</p>

<p>The roof area is nicely done. Loads of details on the sides and the chandelier hanging down from the ceiling is nicely done. (better than the one in the shop)</p>

<p>Overall i&#39;m pretty happy with this set. Ik took me about 3-4 hours to build and it looks great next to the rest of the modular building set. Although I would suggest not placing it next to the town hall because it very tiny compared to that one.</p>

"bitsyww2","2016-04-21T14:48:53.307Z","Almost there.","<p>I bought with high expectations after The detectives office 10246 and the Parisian&nbsp;Restaurant 10243 and it just didn&#39;t quite measure up. &nbsp;It&#39;s still a nice set but it isn&#39;t on par with those two. &nbsp;I found it comparable to Palace Cinema&nbsp;10232. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>Bright, shiny box and a nice thick bound book. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>The sand green&nbsp;windows are nice, especially the arched ones.&nbsp; I would have like to see more colors in general. The monochromatic look is pretty dreary. &nbsp;Even swaping out the tan bricks for a dark red or brick red would have been a big improvement. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures:</h3>

<p>Meh. &nbsp;There needs to be an obvious&nbsp;thief mini fig. &nbsp;Just having the pieces to dress one of the existing figures as a burgular&nbsp;isn&#39;t enough. There should also be a security gaurd. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build:</h3>

<p>The back of the laundry/side of the safe was pretty interesting. &nbsp;The technique used to create the roof ornaments on the bank was also a nice. &nbsp;I loved building the chandelier. &nbsp;Overall though it&nbsp;was pretty much a box. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model: &nbsp;</h3>

<p>My eyes just sort of pass over it in my modular lineup. &nbsp;The Laundry is very visually interesting, but the bank itself is not. &nbsp;I think it&#39;s the color choices because there are certainly plenty of details in the facade. &nbsp;The roof access and stepped roofs are a big design plus. &nbsp;The lack of a back&nbsp;alley is a negative. &nbsp;The second floor is also fairly dull. &nbsp;A lot of space is used for the air vent to allow a robber in that could have been used better. &nbsp;I would have rather seen this as a non corner set&nbsp;with an exploding back panel in the alley or some other means of entrance for the bank robbers. &nbsp;The back two sides are almost as bad as the back on GBHQ 75827. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The little tree is a really great mini build and looks convincing, except it uses the same maddening technique as the street trash can in 75827. I really, really, super,&nbsp;extra, hate that technique. &nbsp;It&#39;s the best way to accidentally launch a piece of brick across a room while building I&#39;ve encountered to date. &nbsp;The four side pieces will never ever be straight or&nbsp;even so if you are remotely OCD just don&#39;t even bother with that part.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>I think this is a B+ set that could have been an A with a few changes. &nbsp;I really do&nbsp;not feel this was worth the rise in price. &nbsp;A third floor or better second floor would make me change my mind about that.&nbsp;</p>

"Duq","2016-05-27T01:30:46.737Z","A worthy successor to the Detective Office","<p>Brick bank is a worthy successor to the Detective Office. It&#39;s a pretty building that fits in nicely with previous modulars. The set has a lot to offer but it does have some issues.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is not the most important part of a set to me. This one is very similar to that of the Detective&#39;s office with the front showing the full building, insets of the floors and a front view that shows the dimensions, confirming that this building is an inch lower than Al&#39;s barbers. The back of the box shows the bank in a street with previous modulars surrounded by various scenes, ranging from burglary and money laundering to handing out money and sweets.</p>

<p>The instructions come in a single 176-page book.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><!--StartFragment-->There are 5 minifigs in this set. Keeping with the tradition of the modulars they all have the classic smiley face. There&#39;s a nice variety in hairstyles and torso prints. From the pictures on the box it seems everyone except the bank manager in his waist coat plays various roles.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>2380 of them to be precise, placing this set somewhere between the previous two modulars in piece count. It&#39;s impossible to describe them all but I&#39;ll mention some of the highlights.</p>

<p>One of the most obvious are the sand green windows, for now unique to this set and there are 34 of them. There are also 4 arched windows in sand green. There are 4 glass panels printed with a nice art nouveau pattern and another one with the name of the launderette.</p>

<p>Texture is provided by grille bricks and grille round bricks in white, and &#39;gold bars&#39; in light grey. Zip line handles and &#39;swirley tops&#39; are used for detailing along with many other parts. The floor pattern inside the bank puts Nexo Knight shields to good use while a French balcony uses the &#39;Elves fence&#39; in black for the first time.</p>

<p>A new piece is a brick that&#39;s 5 plates tall with 4 studs on the front and you get no fewer than 24 of them. The last thing to mention is that there are no stickers! All decorated parts (and there&#39;s a few of them) are printed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building these modulars is always joy because of the interesting details and part usage and the Brick Bank is no exception. It kept me busy and entertained for an evening. Having said that though, this set has a fair bit of repetition around the facade when creating the various columns and the stained glass at the ground floor.</p>

<p>The parts are divided over 4 groups of bags; bags 1 and 2 build the ground floor, bags 3 the mostly empty first floor and bags 4 the roof. As the building has no rear entrance or windows there are two tall plain walls to be built. The instructions luckily vary between wall sections and interior details.</p>

<p>The bank manager&#39;s desk is a nice clever design as is the espresso machine. The section that includes the washing machines and deposit boxes contains a dazzling number of small parts. The standout clever parts usage though has to be the glass screens at the bank counters made with doors held in place by the studs that normally form the handles.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>At first sight the building looks great. Some people have complained about the lack of colour but I have no problem with that. The subtle combination of grey, white and sand green works for me. It&#39;s up there with the Parisian Cafe in architectural detail; the sculpted section over the bank entrance is great and the use of the zip line handles along the roof is just genius. The gold bars in grey add just that bit more texture than 1x2 tiles would have.</p>

<p>The interior of the bank is beautiful; the tile pattern on the floor, the glass screens mentioned earlier and the tall open space topped with a clever rooflight all work very well.</p>

<p>Look a bit closer though and there are some issues. The launderette is tiny and its roof is messy. The modular construction has caused the tall windows in the front to be interrupted where the first floor and roof sections meet. There&#39;s no sign anywhere on the outside to tell you this is a bank!</p>

<p>Starting with the engagement ring in the Parisian Cafe there&#39;s been more focus on stories and play features in the modular buildings. In the Detective Office the cookie story was a funny details but I feel in this set too much space and parts are going towards the story. The chimney is pretty big to let a minifig through and the money laundering wall takes up a lot of pieces. The ladder and the big cheque add very little to the set. I would rather have had a Bank sign, some more detail to the first floor interior and an extra two or three layers of brick to add height.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like the set a lot. It is much better than Town Hall and Cinema but not quite as good as the Parisian Cafe which I think is still the best modular sofar. All my other modulars are still original but this one just screams to be modified.</p>

<p>Having said that, the set is a great value-for-money parts pack and it&#39;s a good looking building packed with play features. I can very much recommend this set for any AFOLs and more experienced younger builders.</p>

"Sethro3","2017-01-23T18:47:45.603Z","You can bank on this set!","<p>The modular building line-up is something I look forward to each year. I recently was able to get this set for Christmas. I looked forward in anticipation to the new releases, but money usually means I cannot get it when it is released. Was this set worth the wait? Find out below.</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>- Color scheme. Most people don&#39;t like this, but I actually really like the white building facade with the light gray/dark gray accents and sand green window. The combination works well together and it gives me a more Gringotts Bank feeling (which I love about this set). The laundromat coloring works incredibly well and I would like to see this as a stand alone building for that fact (which I will modify soon).</p>

<p>- As stated, the sand green windows, of course. But I also love the new arched window piece in sand green. This adds a lot of detailing to the style of the building. And adds yet another color for other buildings.</p>

<p>- Neat architectural detailing with the Elve&#39;s keys and the pully along the roof.</p>

<p>- Smart usage of the ingot tiles, now in a new color.</p>

<p>- The vault is really neat how it actually &quot;locks.&quot;</p>

<p>- The chandelier is incredibly clever.</p>

<p>- Oddly enough the manager&#39;s desk and chair are strong little builds for this set.</p>

<p>- Printed pieces! You&#39;d expect as much from Creator Expert, but sometimes they have to throw in a small sticker sheet. I&#39;m thankful they didn&#39;t in this situation.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- AlthoughI love the idea of the play features, they are a bit hampered here. The first floor is too tall to comfortably reach your hand in to conduct the money laundering and/or chimney entry. I realized it was too small for my giant man hands, but even my 7 year old daughter struggled. But there is no way to modify the interior height without removing the entryway detailing outside. Also, the lobby area is really cramped.</p>

<p>- The tree is at least a different style of build compared to most trees (like Fire Brigade), but it doesn&#39;t look effective. The droopy leaves makes it look sad. And it is only connected by one stud which isn&#39;t the sturdiest of connections.</p>

<p>- I don&#39;t love the clock not being perfectly centered on the corner, but it is effective for how it is designed and I can&#39;t think of any other way to keep it attached to the building.</p>

<p>-&nbsp; The roof of the laundromat building is horrible and unfinished. The building comes off as the bank took over that building and combined a few rooms. Yet somehow the roof looks as though it is a set in a movie and has no substance to it. When I modify it, I will surely make that a full looking roof.</p>

<p>- I also didn&#39;t like the lack of space provided for the roof doorway. It looks fine from the outside (as most of the building does), but when you go to actually &quot;play&quot; it is very limited due to size/space. There are bricks blocking approximately 1 stud of the entry, which limits it down to a 3 stud width.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>While I love the set overall, it isn&#39;t without its faults. I was happy to see some new colorings to make other modular buildings in the future. I like the idea of including 2 buildings in one set, but the space isn&#39;t available to accommodate it in this situation.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend this set, not only for completion sake, but also it makes a great display piece on its own. If your children (or you) want to play with it, I would suggest a heavy remodel to expand the interior.</p>

"PSIXO","2017-02-24T13:36:41.053Z","Awesome set","<p>This is one really awesome set.</p>

<p>This is a my first modular building. I bought it because of the colors and parts assortment but must say its completed look is great and the building experience was a really nice suprise.</p>

<p>If you are looking into getting some modulars I would definitely recommend this one first (there are definitely some good earlier ones but they are discontinued and second hand prices are usually insane for boxed ones).</p>

<p>Only thing I didn&#39;t like about the set was the box. Print is great as usual but parts are too tightly packed inside the box and it doesn&#39;t have any special kind of lid or even storage&nbsp;functionality which I expected from such an expensive set.</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-05-21T17:36:52.653Z","Bulky building with surprisingly little interior space","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Brick Bank is quite a bulky building, especially when compared to its immediate predecessor, the Detective&#39;s Office. In general, IMHO it meets the high standards of the modular range. Still, there are some elements that could have been done better, especially in the interior. A nice thing are the additional stories told on the backside of the box. Personally, I like the overall exterior design of the bank. Highlight (to me) is the skylight in the roof&nbsp;with the chandelier underneath.</p>

<p>The interiors are nice, though the height of the walls makes it somewhat difficult to put in minifigures&nbsp;if your hands are above a certain size. The interior of the bank lacks bright colours, but then again, that to me seems more or less normal for these types of buildings. The office chair for the bank manager is a nice little build. That said, the interiors are good, but not super, IMHO. Overall though, I think the set is worth the money: the exterior, the interiors and the potential stories with the minifigures warrant its price.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>Overall, there are 4&nbsp;groups of bags, 20 in total. There is nothing extremely difficult, the most tricky part, IMHO, being the construction of the washing-machine / safety-deposit-boxes wall. The whole of the build took me about 5,5 hours at an easy pace. Overall the build was quite enjoyable, with the designer breaking up the build in such a way to prevent it from becoming tedious. The design of the chandelier and skylight is quite nice. The clock&nbsp;and the coffee-maker were fun little builds, as was the teller&#39;s window. One of the things that left me wondering is why there was no additional stack of bricks (a column) &#39;connecting&#39; the door to the back-office&nbsp;with the teller&#39;s windows. It is small things like that stood out because of the overall standard of design. The use of the cakes and pulley pieces as elements of a frieze for the bank&#39;s gable is very nice.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are five minifigures included, of which two - the mother/photographer, and the bank secretary play somewhat of a double role, as thief and accomplice. Best prints, IMHO are the ones on the child&#39;s torso and that of the bank manager. There is room for a few additional minifigures, but as a whole it does not feel as if the minifigures&nbsp;&#39;disappear&#39; in the set as they do with the Detective&#39;s Office or Assembly Square.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>As said before, the overall design of this set, IMHO, is quite good. The decision to have the gable of the laundromat / manager&#39;s office look like a separate building is a good one. Otherwise the whole structure would simply have been one monotonous blob. Now it remains interesting. Also, that gable is a nice representation of a more modern shop frontage inserted into an older building, as can be found in many European inner cities. The roof of that part seems a bit off, as if lacking depth, but again - many older European inner city structures have higher roofs or top floors&nbsp;(lacking depth) on the front, to suggest the owner being wealthier than he actually was. That said, a little more depth (2 studs or so) would have been nice. Overall the bank exterior is a nice representation of Neo-Classical and Jugendstil design that works well.</p>

<p>The interior feels smaller than it actually is - mostly because the massive opening towards the ground floor leavers little space for the manager&#39;s office and the secretary&#39;s desk. Likewise, the vault and deposit-boxes / laundry machine wall take up a lot of space. The teller&#39;s desk is nice, as is the stair to the upper floor. The interior wall between the bank and laundromat is not built up to full height, arguably to prevent putting minifigures inside being completely impossible. The chandelier looks great, even from the outside looking in. Overall, the massive windows provide very nice view of the interior. The manager&#39;s chair is a nice inspiration for one&#39;s own&nbsp;MOC.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This set has quite a few suble play features - the &#39;automated&#39; teller, the grate in the chimney (giving access to the thief), the vault door, and the laundry-machine. Yet most of them&nbsp;are - unfortunately - not easy to access. As a display set Brick Bank works well, though one should do everything to hide the two back walls, as they are very ugly to look at. The exterior is quite attractive, with quite a few details to look at.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this is a good set. When comparing it to the Detective&#39;s Office, I would say the exterior looks better, while the interior of Brick Bank does not meet the quality of that of its immediate predecessor. The selection of minifigures is nice, and there are enough story elements incorporated in the design to display numerous scenarios. IMHO this is a set definitely worth getting, of you collect the modular series.</p>

"Zapp_Brannigan","2018-12-29T20:53:35.363Z","I wouldn't wanna open an account here!","<p>When I was ordering the Brick Bank, there was an availability scare because I had to make a backorder for the package to be shipped within 30 days, meaning&nbsp;there was a small chance it wouldn&#39;t make it on time for the holidays. This happened during the Black Friday weekend which meant that certain sets were 20% off.&nbsp;Knowing LEGO and considering that this set is a modular, I certainly couldn&#39;t pass up on such a deal. No more than 12 hours after making the backorder, the Brick Bank was sold out and has been so since. I received the order a little more than 3 weeks after placing the backorder, so the 30 day time span was certainly met. I was at The LEGO Store a couple days ago and they told me the set is retiring soon so they don&#39;t plan on obtaining more stock. To say the least, I was extremely lucky to get an official, first hand copy of the set at a discounted price, which I am no doubt very thankful for.</p>

<p>The Brick Bank is the 11th modular building preceded by 10246 Detective&#39;s Office and succeeded by 10255 Assembly Square, being the third corner building after 10182 Cafe Corner and 10232 Palace Cinema. It is my 6th modular building and I&#39;m glad to say that I now own all the modulars&nbsp;successively from 2013-2017, with 10211 Grand Emporium being the sole outlier in my collection. I&#39;m not sure if 10260 Downtown Diner or even the upcoming 10264 Corner Garage will eventually be a part of my collection, as I&#39;m noticing a personal tendency to buy modulars&nbsp;2-3 years after their release.</p>

<p>The premise for the Brick Bank is very similar to the Detective&#39;s Office with play being emphasized more so than modulars&nbsp;from previous years. Nonetheless, the design is spectacular and there is no shortage in new techniques or pieces used in situations I&#39;ve never seen before. Build time was 8 hours and easy building was facilitated since for the first time&nbsp;I used the 9 section bin from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4153-1/Freestyle-Playcase"">4153</a> to sort out all my pieces.</p>

<p>Minifigures include a child, civilian/thief, bank teller, receptionist, and manager. I usually don&#39;t care much for minifigures&nbsp;but I feel that here there should have been an actual robber included as opposed to redressing the civilian as a thief using a handkerchief and cap. All parts are printed which have been the case as in the previous two modulars&nbsp;(the last modular to have stickers was Palace Cinema). These include&nbsp;the cheque, picture frames, and &quot;Soap n&#39; Suds&quot; and bank window panes.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;primary customer service area on the first floor&nbsp;has nothing more than a small table with an envelope and writing quill. However, behind the security glass and door are the counters where the tellers work and there is also a coin counter with four gold coins included. Behind the counters is the centrepiece of the set: the vault. The vault is secured behind a working vault door whose handle needs to be turned to lock and and unlock it. Inside the vault are heaps of dollar bills and three black safes which store various valuables including silver coins, jewelry, and even a gold bar. Above the safes is a section of the chimney where thieves enter through, covered by a vent door.&nbsp;The roof of the vault is covered by a metal grate which can be opened to allow interior access. In the corner of the first floor is a laundromat with a chair, small table, and four washing machines. Beside the washing machines is an orange detergent container whose colour is no doubt a call out to the infamous Tide brand. The top right washing machine is a little strange, indicated by the red light where the other three washing machines&nbsp;have blue lights, because this is where the literal &quot;money laundering&quot; is performed. Putting valuables through this washing machine will land them in the safe in the bank vault. Due to the interconnectedness of the bank and laundromat, and to enable better play, the safes, coin counter, and washing machines are built as one module and can easily be removed, as well as the chimney section sitting above. The stairs are hinged to allow better access to the restricted area behind the door.</p>

<p>The second floor is the receptionist&#39;s and manager&#39;s office. The receptionist&#39;s desk has a lamp and typewriter which apparently uses a modern keyboard. There is a coffee machine behind the desk which sits above a drawer with candy and paper inside. Beside the desk is a fireplace which connects to the chimney used for breaking in. A door leads to inside the manager&#39;s office, which has an ingeniously built rounded corner desk and comfortable chair. There is also a normal chair for the patron and a cabinet with decorative bird sitting on top. The manager&#39;s office overlooks the atrium which I think is a wonderful design choice for this situation as opposed to an entirely covered floor. As always there is a door leading to the roof. The chimney&nbsp;begins at the roof and the thief must make their long descent all the way down to the vault. The arched skylight is amazing and allows light to enter the atrium. The painstakingly detailed&nbsp;chandelier lights up the atrium and&nbsp;is hinged to allow the roof to rest on a flat surface when taken off.</p>

<p>The details of the building are amazing and they include the emblem above the main entrance with wings and microfigure, silver cupcakes above the windows, stained glass, roof shield, corner clock, and zip line handles for the parapets. The green windows and arches are an excellent combination. The columns are actually the same piece as the gold bar but coloured&nbsp;grey to serve as bricks. The main floor of the bank is tiled using Nexo&nbsp;knight shields (technique seen again later in Assembly Square). The laundromat, however, has its own building style which fits with&nbsp;that used in Detective&#39;s Office. The illusion of two buildings is deceptive since the bank manager&#39;s office actually sits directly above the laundromat. Even though the laundromat is narrow, it still manages to pack details in, such as the pants and washing machine decor above the entrance, awnings, and unevenly sloped roof. There is a zip line handle sticking from the roof which is supposed to help the robbers climb up the roof to get to the chimney. The tree and bench are minor additions but also very well and creatively built. Finally, there is a ladder with wash bucket, as well as a rope for climbing up the building.</p>

<p>As with the Detective&#39;s Office, there was a bit of uncertainty surrounding the emphasis on play over design. Personally, I think that&nbsp;for the most part&nbsp;both have been achieved successfully. However, as in the Detective&#39;s Office, the laundromat walls don&#39;t go all the way up to the roof, which was probably deliberate to easier access the laundromat interior. As well, on the main floor, there is no wall or enclosure which shuts the gap formed between the glass door and roof, meaning that all the robber needs to do is climb the first five or six steps and then slide through that space&nbsp;to get behind the door. However, this looks rather uncomfortable from a minifigure&#39;s perspective, so perhaps I can let it slide. I do agree with others that there should be a sign indicating that this is a bank, but I&#39;m not too overly concerned with this.</p>

<p>Overall, the Brick Bank is a great addition to my collection and again I got it at 20% off from $220 to $176 CAD which of course was an offer I couldn&#39;t refuse. According to the official LEGO site there is no label marking this set as &quot;Retiring Soon&quot; in North America, (contrary to European countries)&nbsp;but I&#39;m assuming this and Detective&#39;s Office won&#39;t be around much longer if at all. I&#39;d like to say again I was very fortunate to get my hands on one before it retired because it was very much worth the money.&nbsp;</p>
