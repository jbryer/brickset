<p>Yes, 80s. I can&#39;t shake off this feeling. The colors, the purple roller-skates, the boombox. To me, the boombox&nbsp;is a highlight of the set. It captures the look perfectly and tiny cassette&nbsp;is so cute. And it inserts with almost identical click of plastic as a real one. Right in the feels.</p>

<p>The quantity&nbsp;of colors is stunning: there are like 3-4 shades of each color:&nbsp;pale, core, saturated, cold/warm and they spread across different pieces. To build something mono-colored is nigh impossible. You would get something like this:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://s019.radikal.ru/i628/1707/ca/48cb776d9f09t.jpg"" /></p>

<p>So you have to embrace color as a&nbsp;discrete entity and work around it. This&nbsp;induces to go for a stylized creations, something like this:</p>

<p>It&#39;s a new way for me to think about building and it&#39;s really hard to embrace, so 4-99 year age on the box is very appropriate. Plus, not all the models pictured are present in the instruction manual, so you have to check it online. Actually, I&#39;m all for it &ndash; it bugs me slightly how much paper they waste.</p>

<p>This parrot was made following online instructions:</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure kids would love this set, because of this artistic aspect, online-instructions&nbsp;and strange builds in different scales. But as an addition to the collection it&#39;s ok. Also, I think there&#39;s not enough plates.</p>

<p>Price and parts aren&#39;t impressive. But the building experience was awesome in building the house and the music player. The playability is ok for what&#39;s included.</p>
