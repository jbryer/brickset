"Hylocera","2016-08-04T19:49:41.053Z","Cute Addition to Skybound","<p>Got this set out of a need to complete my Skybound collection, but this is actually a nice little build in its own right.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The plane comes in a polybag with a tiny instruction sheet folded over 8 or 10 times. The instructions are pretty straightforward and most of the plane can probably be built without them.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For a set this size there are a lot of nice parts. The wings are a pair of black katanas, the engines or exhaust pipes are trans-black bottles, and the tail is an anchor. Can never have enough of those parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The pilot of the plane is Bucko; he is the same as the Bucko in other sets so there&#39;s nothing too special here.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very quick, with one or two somewhat interesting techniques, but most of it is &quot;typical&quot; stuff.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished plane is in a word, cute. It looks adorable next to Misfortune&#39;s Keep and some of the larger pirate vehicles. At the same time, it fits perfectly in a display as part of a swarm of the various gliders and small planes the pirates use. My only complaint is the use of katanas as wings, which look way too skinny.</p>

<p>While it&#39;s a nice set with nice pieces, I wouldn&#39;t necessarily get one as a parts pack. However, having 2 or 3 of these mixed in with the pirate army for a Skybound display is great, and for that this set is perfect.</p>

"Red_Five2","2016-12-20T19:39:45.3Z","The skybound plane.","<p>Set 30421 (the skybound plane) comes with one minifig. The minifig has a green hat. The head shows a ginger beard, also it shows a black eyepatch. The torso has a white skull. At the back is one of the sword holders but this one is printed on the torso. The legs are orange and brown. The accessory is a brown pistol.</p>

<p>The plane build is very simple. At the back there is a black anchor. In the front there are two bottles. Also there is a place to sit. Right at the front there is also a brown steering wheel which they have on pirate ships. But there are two black swords.</p>
