"mikemakesmusic","2016-03-13T20:30:16.69Z","Thanks LEGO!","<p>Free from LEGO in March 2016 with qualifying purchase. &nbsp;We ordered the Brick Bank and got this fun little set for free. &nbsp;Nice surprise since I didn&#39;t know about this giveaway! &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Polybag - Very easy to follow instructions</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>39 pcs. Mine had 6 extra pcs including an extra set of the cool triangular throwing stars. &nbsp;The flame pieces are beautiful and would be GREAT pieces for MOCs!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This little guy&#39;s name is Kai. &nbsp;Nice print on his torso and legs. &nbsp;Printed on his back as well! &nbsp;Cool helmet/head wrap that appears to be a single piece but with an excellent dual color application. He comes with triangular throwing stars!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very easy build, but the brick built dragon is far more fun than I anticipated. &nbsp;Nice color palate with the possible exception of the dragon&#39;s yellow torso. &nbsp;It&#39;s the only piece of that color and it seems to me that a red piece may have been more appropriate at the risk of being a bit boring. It does tie in with the yellow in the flames and perhaps that&#39;s the reason for the yellow piece. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Simple, yet sparks the imagination. &nbsp;And THAT is, for me, what LEGO bricks and building are all about! &nbsp;Nice one, LEGO! &nbsp;Thanks!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A fun and simple build with&nbsp;great playability. &nbsp;A definite win for the Ninjago fan in your house!</p>

"Hylocera","2016-04-30T00:53:32.097Z","Nice Little Dragon","<p>Recently got this polybag with some other stuff off Bricklink. I mainly got it for the Skyboud Kai minifig and Mixels joints, but it turned out to be a pretty nice set in its own right.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Instructions come on a single sheet that is folded many times, typical of polybags/Mixels/CMF&#39;s. The poly itself is pretty big, and the dragon/Kai will fit in it even after being built.</p>

<h3>Parts/Minifigures</h3>

<p>There is an extra of each stud (orange and trans-magenta or some color like that), an extra of each cheese slope (dark red and trans-orange), and a pair of extra pearl gold shurikens on a sprue. I&#39;ve always loved the shuriken piece, and it&#39;s nice to get some in such a small set. The way prices for this set are on the aftermarket, this also looks to be one of the better ways to get Mixels joints, those large flame pieces, and Kai.</p>

<p>All the different iterations of Ninjas in this theme makes it pretty annoying to get a &quot;set&quot; of them that all have the same design. Luckily, Kai here has the same design as the other Skybound ninjas.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I was actually pretty impressed with this set once I finished it. My original plan was to sort it once I had built it once, but now I think it might stay on my shelf for a while. The wings look much better in person than in the picture, although they are clipped onto two <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4140585"">1x2 plates w/ stick</a>, which stick out and look unsightly. I would have preferred the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4226876"">3.18 version</a> instead. The neck uses 2 trans-orange cheese slopes, which is a nice break in the&nbsp;color, but using red ones instead would still have looked better.&nbsp;Lastly, the belly is composed of a yellow&nbsp;piece that looks&nbsp;totally wrong in person; it too&nbsp;would look better in red.</p>

<p>For the price I got&nbsp;this&nbsp;set&nbsp;at&nbsp;($3.58;&nbsp;you can get a MISB one for even less on BrickLink), it is great value for money and overall still a nice piece for display or play. It&#39;s a great little parts pack for anybody looking for more substance than just the Kai minifig by itself, and great for anybody looking to add a nice, not too large dragon to their creature collection.</p>

"ZG_Brickfilms","2016-05-23T00:20:32.19Z","The Perfect Little Dragon","<p>As dragons are an important part of the Ninjago universe, getting cheap little dragons that still fit a minifig&nbsp;is perfect.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The set comes in a polybag that includes a free child ticket to Legoland&nbsp;on the back of it. The instructions are on a piece of paper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The set features a lot of bell joints, which are good but only in grey colors. There aren&#39;t&nbsp;t any prints, stickers, or new parts in this set.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>There is only one minifig, which is Kai in his Airjitzu&nbsp;suit. It is the exact same version of Kai from previous Skybound&nbsp;sets.</p>

<p>The Build&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is simple, easy, and fun.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>This is a good model. The dragon has a good look and decent playability. I do dislike that you&nbsp;can&#39;t&nbsp;t move the feet forward but everything else is good.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This makes for a great set. I like the smaller dragons as oppose to the big ones weve&nbsp;&nbsp;gotten. The minifigure is nothing special but is still nice to get. If your a collector of Ninjago I definitely recommend this and I think it will go great with the Cole&#39;s mini dragon. I really hope that each of the ninja get a small dragon like this one.</p>

"Master_Wu","2019-10-22T03:22:32.227Z","Got it for the mini figure","<p>This is a dandy little polybag that can usually be found for a couple of Dollars online. This is a good price for what you get!</p>

<p>The dragon was an enjoyable build with movable feet, wings, neck and tail!</p>

<p>The minifigure&nbsp;was the main reason why I purchased this set, and I didn&#39;t go wrong there! The Fire Ninja has some very nice printing and head piece as well as some cool&nbsp;shurikens.</p>

<p>I would recommend this fun set for any fan of dragons or ninjas!</p>

"Pariah_","2019-05-20T14:29:45.097Z","cool set","<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>I got this set from the travelers championship (golf) and they were giving it out. I thought it was cool so I grabbed 2, one for me and another so I could write this review. It comes with 1 minifigure and is a cheap and common way to get Kai. He comes with a handful of shruikens which is nothing special.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Main Build</h2>

<p>This set includes Kai&#39;s mini dragon and is mostly an average build. The other reason I got 2 of this set is because it&#39;s a fairly good for parts. You get 3 flame pieces, which is good for various MOCs&nbsp;and the golden clips can be used for other builds too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Playability</h2>

<p>It&#39;s Ok I&nbsp;guess. Kai can sit on the top of the dragon and the dragon has fair articulation in the legs,head,neck,wings, and tail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>It&#39;s good if you want the parts and the minifigure but not exactly the best for play. 8/10</p>
