<p>A polybag with the helicopter shown flying over a mountainous&nbsp;background.</p>

<p>The instructions are a standard folded single sheet with 16 build steps.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>47 parts, none are particularly&nbsp;rare or unusual. The two white&nbsp;Brick 1X2 W. 2 Knobs are always handy to have.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As you would expect for a Creator set, the model is fairly realistic despite the small piece count. The model looks like it could be a fairly small helicopter, perhaps like a Robinson R44 or similar, although the model does suggest that it has turbines/turboshafts. The main and tail rotors can be spun, and there are a few nice details such as a tailight. The colours (blue and white) suggest this could potentially be a police helicopter. The set is very similar to the 2010 Creator Mini Helicopter&nbsp;5864.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A decent little Creator Helicopter.</p>
