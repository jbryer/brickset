There are 5 different cars that come in 2 sets, (set 1 10025 and set 2 10022) which contain all the parts necessary to build any of the cars in that set.

The most noticeable feature of these sets is the 1 x 2 silver grille bricks that are used to create the distinctive corrugated metal sheeting affect of the side of the prototype cars. This looks very good and is complemented by the silver backed Santa Fe stickers, which are located top centre of the sides of each car. Bottom centre of the sides is a 1 x 4 tile to allow for the silver backed car number sticker – all necessary alternative numbers are provided – stickers are the same for both sets.  Also included are stickers for the under frame equipment on each car (which differs between sets 1 &amp; 2). There is also a “Super Chief” name board sticker for the 2 x 2 tile on the rear of the observation car – you will only use one of these so have 4 spares.

Set 2 enables you to build either an observation car a dining car or a sleeping car. The construction of all cars is similar with different window/door combinations depending on which of the versions you need. Most of the alternative parts relate to the different detailed interiors – which are much more detailed in set 2 than set 1, but maybe that is because in reality they would be. All or part of the roof sections are removable to gain access to the detailed interiors – which could have benefited from some Minifig passengers – which are not included. 

This set is in my view superior to set 1 in that it contains many alternative parts which can be used for other things, as when you have built all 3 different versions you will have a considerable number of parts left over for your money. If you can’t afford them all definitely go for set 2 cars as you do get more for your money, and they do, in my opinion, look better than the set 1 cars, and definitely rate a maximum score.

(My friend asked me why when I bought it because it looks dull and plain) Many pieces to build.  If comes with some minifig, it will be much better.  Moreover, should use some pieces to describe the engine part instead of using sticker.  I would be glad to know any suggestion to modify this part?  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2008-02-07T08:15:34.53Z","Constructional flaw!","When you buy this set, you can build three different waggons. You won't use all parts for every waggon. This means there will always be some parts left no matter if you build the dining car, the observation car or the sleeping car. This is good because you automatically have some replacement parts if you lose a brick or you can use the bricks for other things you would like to build. 

The interior of all the three waggons is very detailed. Even suitcases are included but no passengers. So you must buy them seperately or use the minifigs that are included in railway stations, for instance. You can also take off the roofs, which always remain where they are when the engine pulls the waggons. I have never lost the roofs, not even at full speed.

I just want to remind you that this set comes with old gray bricks. The same is true for 10025 and 10020. However, set 10022 has a constructional flaw. There are two old gray 2x6 plates on the upside down construction between the wheels. The studs of those plates touch the surface of curved rails. Friction is caused and the motor slows down in curvy parts of your track layout. So you MUST substitute the plates by tiles unless you want to damage your motor and the studs of the 2x6 plates. This problem is only relevant for this set since the upside down construction is one plate lower and closer to the rails than the one of set 10025. This constructional flaw made me rate it 4 instead of 5. 

The BNSF engine 10133 comes with the same constractional flaw. You must also substitute the black 4x6 plate, which is on the upside down construction between the wheels, by tiles, otherwise the studs of the plate will cause friction when the engine goes over curved tracks. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
