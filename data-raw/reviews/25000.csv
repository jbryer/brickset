All three share the same eye pieces and rough scale and as a result they work well together in a display. 30474 was never released through Shop at Home but apparently was available as a promotional item elsewhere. I bought mine through Bricklink, where they&rsquo;re now available at modest prices.</p>

<p>The pair of golden bells and slightly oversized head make this young reindeer a charming and endearing model. The 1x2 dark brown curved tiles used on the outside of each leg capture the svelte profiles of the beast&rsquo;s legs, and the reindeer as a whole has a delicate rather than chunky appearance, which is rare with brick-built creatures. It&rsquo;s a cute rather than realistic model. The beast has many points of articulation&mdash;one for each leg and two for the neck&mdash;so it has a surprising ability to be posed. It can look up or down, and its legs can be splayed out like on an icy surface. Its eyes may be rotated for further variety.</p>

<p>Similar figures have been criticized recently for their jumble of colors, especially when joints are involved, but in this case the jumble doesn&rsquo;t bother me and I think it captures a multicolored or mottled look quite well. The pieces are common, even the little golden bells, but they&rsquo;re all useful parts.</p>

<p>The set&rsquo;s only (and very minor) flaw is its questionable stability. Normally with a set like this I would press the set lightly down on a flat surface in order to straighten out the legs, trusting that their flat bottoms would lead to a 90-degree orientation with respect to the surface. This is not the case with set 30474: the bottoms of the legs are quite skinny because of the curved 1x2 tiles. This means that the reindeer&rsquo;s legs have a propensity to fold inwards when pressure is placed on the body on a smooth level surface.</p>

<p>This little reindeer is one of the most charming seasonal sets yet produced and is well worth seeking out. Five stars.</p>
