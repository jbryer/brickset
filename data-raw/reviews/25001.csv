<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Basic, like all poly-bags, nice background.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>No new ones for me, nice printing on the body &amp; head &amp; especially the dics. The head is exactly the same as Ezra Bridger from Lego Star Wars Rebels (both sides!).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Cosmic Boy, the WHOLE set.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very simple, no instructions!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very nice, not disappointed @ all.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A very nice mini-figure, which is my 1st&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;DC figure.&nbsp;If you can get this online or in store packaged with the movie&nbsp;i recommend getting this, even if the movie doesn&#39;t interest you.</p>

Hopefully Saturn Girl will show up eventually.</p>

<p>Cosmic Boy is a really impressive Minifigure, he&#39;s got a double-sided torso with a great print, loaded with detail for his suit, the colours almost remind me of a Punisher outfit, without the skull logo mind you. His belt is a nice looking detail also with the L symbol for the Legion on his buckle. His legs are plain white with black printing, this was made before dual-molding became more common place I suspect. He&#39;s using Zod&#39;s hairpiece from the MOS sets and his facial expressions are a regular smile and a concerned, there&#39;s trouble we have to deal with, look.</p>

<p>For accessories you get two small radar dishes to attach to his hands to represent his power and a larger dish for him to stand on that shows him levitating with his magnetic powers. All three of which feature printing cosmic looking details in a spiral pattern.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a very nice looking figure and included with a very impressive film, as my review of the film covered. I&#39;d recommend getting him for fans of DC Super Heroes, especially the Legion of Super Heroes.</p>
