<p>This figure is supposed to depict a walking fire hydrant and it does do a decent job at capturing the detail!</p>

<p>There are also some very nice parts in this build! there are some red fenders, some hooks and joints, and a cool water bucket!</p>

<p>While the build itself does not have great play values, I recommend this set for any fan of Lego!</p>
