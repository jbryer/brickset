<p>The building experience was awesome due to the different parts you build for Surgeo such as the drawer, syringe arm, and more. The parts are also great for certain colours and the banana pieces in gray. The value is also great for another good looking Mixel. The playability also offers a lot more compared to other Mixels such as the accessories in its arms.</p>

<p>Also don&#39;t know if this play feature is intentional or not, but Surgeo has a teeth piece on top of his head. So sometimes, I flip the head, and&nbsp;it&#39;s like a different character with a new expression. So that&#39;s some nice added playability.</p>
