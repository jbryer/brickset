The selection is excellent: among other parts, the four white descending teeth, the four white circular tiles with holes in the middle, and the black &ldquo;ice cream cone&rdquo; that holds on the all-seeing eye are all handy to have. For $4.99&mdash;and especially for $3.99, what I paid&mdash;it&rsquo;s worth buying for the parts alone.</p>

<p>Having not seen the television show, however, I admit that I do not understand the character. I found playability lacking: the range of motion is limited and no alternate poses are possible. Furthermore, I&rsquo;m not actually sure what the source material was. Is this surgeon-themed or dentist-themed? An oral surgery theme seems too specific. The combination light/defibrillator suggests an operating room, but Skrubz&rsquo; perpetually open mouth simulates that awkward moment at the dentist when one is being talked at but cannot respond. This sums up the character well, I think: immobile and uncharismatic.</p>

<p>This set also includes a Nixel, who looks unhappy or possibly nauseated at the prospect of Skrubz&rsquo; gaping maw. Again, the parts are excellent: two black arms, a three-toothed black haircut, and adorably piebald black and white legs. Here the Nixel far exceeds the Mixel in character and posability!</p>
