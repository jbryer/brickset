And it&#39;s another Iron Man suit, previously we had the Gun mouting system with Iron Patriot now we have Silver Centurion.</p>

<p>This minifigure is loaded with details, he&#39;s got printing all around his torso, almost all around his legs, on the sides of his dual-molded arms and even on the two tiles attached to the unique armor piece he&#39;s wearing for shoulder armor. Silver Centurion is one of the most detailed suits that LEGO has produced to date, and he looks great. Tony&#39;s face features the same expression as on others, but his alternative facial print includes a beaten and black-eyed Tony Stark, which I believe is unique to this figure.</p>

<p>The customary studs and tubes are included to simulate repulsor lifting power. Overall this is a must have Minifigure and I&#39;d definitely recommend going above and beyond to find one for your collection, he&#39;s got a very detailed print which looks brilliant. Strongly recommended.</p>

<p>Comes in normal polybag figure bag and comes with no instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with 12 pieces. The armor for it is really nice. Also the the two printed pieces were really nice as well. Tony Stark&#39;s head is doubled sided. One side has a black eye and the other side has a grin on it. The printing on the body and legs is great. The detail on the arms is incredible.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>Just building a minifigure.&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is my favorite Iron Man out of them all. The detail on it is incredible. The expressions on Tony Stark&#39;s face are really good. You even get some nice pieces you don&#39;t usually get in these types of sets. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5&nbsp;star rating.&nbsp;</p>

This was a GWP several years ago, but it was mysteriously reissued this year at GameStop. Is this highly sought after figure worth it? Damn right it is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigure and build: The bag comes with a great shot of the Mark XXXIII in flight, though with an Age of Ultron&nbsp;logo instead of a more appropriate Iron Man 3, where the armor actually appeared. The bag has no instructions, but they aren&#39;t needed. The figure comes with the standard Iron Man helmet, though with silver&nbsp;faceplate. Additionally, it has great chest piece with shoulder fins that really make this suit stand out. The front has space for the 1x1&nbsp;square tile, printed with an arc reactor. The back has another specially printed 1x2&nbsp;tile, that while really great when combined with the shoulder piece, cover the printing on the back. I&#39;m not sure there&#39;s a way around that issue though. Speaking of printing, this figure has it everywhere, including and most importantly, the arms and sides of the legs. Wow! The prints are intricately detailed and make this figure perfect. I know it&#39;s impossible from a financial perspective for LEGO to do this on more figures; but, seeing it first hand, a guy can dream. The head is two sided, with a cocky face on one side and a serious one with a black eye on the other. The second face is fitting for the culminating battle in Iron Man 3 when the House Party Protocol helped to defeat the &quot;Mandarin&quot;. &nbsp;Still the worst twist in the MCU.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want to build an expansive Hall of Armor MOC&nbsp;(as I am), you need this figure. I was lucky to get one for the amazing price of free in the reissue and couldn&#39;t be happier, so value for the money is through the roof. Now it&#39;s likely harder to find this at a reasonable price, but check around&nbsp;and grab it if you can.&nbsp;</p>

"Saffroth","2019-03-18T00:30:05.24Z","LEGO Silver Centurion polybag review","<p>Well, I got this in 2019 from a GameStop store that had it as a promotional item with some new Marvel game. I understand that this won&#39;t help everyone, as it&#39;s pretty expensive on the secondary market.</p>

<p>Building Experience:</p>

<p>I gave this a 2 since it&#39;s just a minifig, goes together real easy. It&#39;s a minifig.</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>I gave this a 5 since the parts are very good, one of the best minifigures I own. Everything apart from the four trans-light blue parts is printed, even the helmet piece! The arms are dual-molded and there is front and side printing on the legs.</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>It&#39;s just one minifigure, you can swoosh it around with the included transparent pieces attached I guess. It&#39;s more a display item that you&#39;d have in a case or on a shelf with other Iron Man minifigures.</p>

<p>Value for Money</p>

<p>I got this for free from GameStop, so the value is good. However, this will not apply to everyone.</p>
