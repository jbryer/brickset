By adding a compressor to pneumatic models, you really add something to the set, and you weren't forced to buy the expensive 8868 compressor-truck.

They really should have more of those sets available in retail these days, i'm sure I would be at the store the day they are released to buy at least 4 of them.

Oh shucksss..  I forgot: you also need a 9V motor pack (1990 or 1998)..to use this, and those aren't available anymore either :(.
Really too bad, 'cause extra sets as these wouldn't only make it easier for customers to gain specific parts, it would make them affordable too.

Hopefully to be continued...
