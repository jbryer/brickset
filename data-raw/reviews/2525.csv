Seriously, folks, there is enough parts in here to make 4 cars, all on low wheels.  I find the springy wheels to be especially useful and fun in making dirt bikes and other such things.  They are really multipurpose and such, however you must watch out not to tip them too far to the side, or they will scrape the chassis of your car.  I would recommend this set if you have some bricks already for the body of the car and the windshield.  All around, a good buy for any collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

And the parts aren't even that special. This set is different-it costs 11 cents per part, and contains 2 rare parts-the spring wheels.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>The spring wheels are extremely useful, at least with smaller cars (nowadays the size has made them outdated).<br></li><li>Good parts value<br></li><li>You get a lot of wheels and wheel accessories<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>All service packs seem to be harder to find nowadays since they were released in Service Pack catalogs<br></li></ul>I would highly recommend this set for anyone who likes classic town vehicles. It fits well into the race subtheme, the outback subtheme, the tiny turbos subtheme (mini monster truck!), and many others. If you can't get the set cheap, you can buy the individual parts to make it up on bricklink-it should be quite cheap to do so. NOTE-the playabiltity and build are at one, but they should be N/A-the set really isn't meant for either<br>",TRUE,4,5,1,1,4
