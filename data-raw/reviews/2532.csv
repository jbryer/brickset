Minus the grey antenna, this service pack is almost the same, al be it in a somewhat different size and number of items. Nevertheless, I bought the set from Ebay with this particular service pack in mind. It's definitely worth getting, and can be used to replace lost or broken cannons, and supplement your stock of cannon tubes. They are grey, so they are more easy to find after shooting them than their (older) black counterparts. Also worth getting to make the 6274, which is delivered with 2 cannons but can hold 4, better armed.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
