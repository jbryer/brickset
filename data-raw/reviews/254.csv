"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-02T09:04:45.553Z","LEGO Studios - Movie Backdrop Studio Review","This is an awsome set which is a nice addition in your LEGO collection for sure. I like the way how LEGO made the background moving. We get two different background papers. One has a day scene and the other one a night scene. Both papers have a glue strip which makes it easier for you to close the background. We also get a motor which makes the background moving to the left or to the right. We also get a platform which you can use for the helicopter which comes with it. It's a cool looking helicopter and the pieces there are printed. In fact: This set doesn't include any stickers.<br><br>This set also comes with a cool looking black sports car. It does remind me a little bit of the car from the LEGO Racers videogames 1 and 2 from the character Rocket Racer. You also get a staff which is useful if you want to do a pursuit. I also can't complain about the minifigs as well. We get a police officer, a stuntman and a cameraman who comes with a camera as well. It's a cool set to have around and it's worth the money for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
