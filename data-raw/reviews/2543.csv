"Widdi","2007-03-26T09:28:27.013Z","One of my first sets","I got this set way back in 1992, when I just had turned 4 years old, but played with older LEGO from my mother's childhood days. It has pieces to build anythiung you want to. From small cars, sculptures, to simple houses. The only thing, which is really lacking is a minifigure, since this set didn't come with one. Overall a solid 4/5 fpr this basic set",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MetroiD","2009-01-11T18:42:20.14Z","Nice, versatile set","Got this one as a kid when we had to move away from home for a couple of weeks while it was being refurbished. Since I had no access to my other LEGO collection which was sorted in a box and sealed shut, my mum bought me this set, so that I could still construct stuff whenever I felt like it. I must say that even without any additional parts the bricks included in this one were sufficient to build a non-sophisticated, rather basic version of pretty much anything. Of course, I could always add detail later, once I got my hands on my other LEGO bricks, but during these 2 weeks away from my collection, this set kept me quite satisfied. A thoroughly deserved 5 out of 5.

Pros:
Variety of bricks and plates in different colours
Contain a small baseplate
Even includes wheels, flowers, windows & so on - i.e. quite useful
The set itself is in a box with a handlebar, which is rather handy

Cons:
No minifigs included, but then again it's a ""Basic"" set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
