So I bought this pack and a few pirate minifigs and I was a happy guy. This accessory pack has some pretty cool pieces that can help someone if they've lost a few key pieces or if they just want some additional weapons or something. I'm not sure if Lego still makes these accessory packs for their themes anymore, but it was greatly appreciated back in the day.",FALSE,3,4,1,1,4
