So when this one hit Shop at Home I scooped it up and use it often when making things freestyle.  I like the 25 degree bricks because it dosen't take as many to cover the house and to me the look more realistic.  Hope to come across a simular set one day in black.  Great to have in the closet- will compliment any collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
