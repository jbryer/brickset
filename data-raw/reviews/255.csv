"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-07T12:13:57Z","Not bad","This set has a nice building. The explosion idea is great because young ones sometimes like it to break down the thing they just build up.
I bought the first when it was for sale (25 euro instead of 40) and 2 others when they were for 12 euro.
I have made a bank building with the first set and some other bricks. It has much modern business windows and 2 great plates. the figs are nice but they are all much common.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Com161","2007-09-24T00:16:38.827Z","Kaboom!","The is actually a very nice set. First off, The mini-figures in this set work very well with the set, even though they can be found in other sets. The movie equiptment also looks very realistic, especially the chrome elements on the spotlights. But the main focus of the set is the exploding bank itself, which has a very cool look to it, by the way. However, the part that stands out is the exploding mechanisim which never fails to work. The design of the mechanisim is very clever in the way of just using string and springs. Although it could have used a back ground, this does not take away from the set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"krysto2002","2008-08-01T08:32:07.233Z","Pretty good deal","This set (though it has no camera like the largest from the series) is a good for anyone trying to make a LEGO movie, it has all you need to make one or pretend to make one.
The set is loaded with accessories, has enough minifigures (though a clerk for the bank would be cool), and tons of props!

For anyone who is a fan of the studios series, this is great, since it includes all the necessary items (lights, cameras, a director's chair, and so on...), and for $20 is a fair deal.

The set includes a stuntman/robber on a motorcycle, a director (though no clapboard...), a cameraman and cam-cart (as I call it), fake dynamite and a detonator (for added playability), and the whole set is collapsable, so when the mechanism on the side is pushed, the whole bank falls apart, pillars, safe, windows and all.

Overall, a definite five, but more of a 9.5/10 since the movie has only one actor, but even alone it is still loaded with playability.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-12T10:04:25.193Z","LEGO Studios - Explosion Studio Review","This set is a good addition to your LEGO city. But be careful it's a little bit flimsy because it's high-explosive! The way how to explode this building is really awsome and the main attraction of this set. You get a lever which has the screen with the number 4 and underneath the platform on the bank are two small red LEGO Technic pistons which makes the explosion effect possible. That also explains why everything on this building is very flimsy. But for this play feature it's worth it because this bank should explode. We also get two flood lights, a red motorcycle, a vehicle for the camera which can sviwel full 360Â° and a chair for the director.<br><br>I also can't complain about the number of minifigs we get in this set. We get a cop who has the basic LEGO Town police uniform, a stuntman with a black suit, a black helmet and the face of the LEGO Rock Raiders character Sparks, the director with a gray megaphone, a beard and glasses on his face, a black cap and black pants. The minifig has a printing on the back which says 'director'. The cameraman has a printing on the back as well. On the back you can read the word 'cameraman'. He also has a blue cap, blue pants and the face of the LEGO Rock Raiders minifig Docs. This set also comes with some dynamite pieces and some money. This model is a great built and we don't get any stickers to worry about. It's a cool set to have in any LEGO collection for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"WoutStopmotion","2012-08-14T02:24:19.893Z","BOOM!","A somewhat medium sized set in the Studio's line, which the line popularized Brickfilms and also kind of teached you about movie trickery. I bought this one in the beginning of this year, and its quite well.<br><br><b>Building Experience<br><br></b>The build is quite easy, although it might get a little bit repetitive some times. Also, every time you press the button to make it ""explode"", you need to set up everything again. That's why i gave it a three.<br><br><b>Parts<br><br></b>Now this set had quite some nice parts. The figures look classic, and actually were a bit. You could probably only get them in the Studios sets. Four figs in total which look very nice. Also there are alot of cool parts such as a few rarish ones like two Technic springs.<br>There are some dynamite tiles, money tiles, cameras and lights, and other fun pieces.<br><br><b>Playability</b><br><br>Obviously this gets a good score! What happens in this set is that the Stuntman goes into the building and steals a briefcase. Then he rides away on his red motorbike, and the building explodes! It looks great and is really awesome. In a few different ways using a yellow plate-like piece you can use it as a sort of catapult, too! But... when you're done you'll have to reset the whole thing! And that is the reason why this part didn't get a 5, just a 4.<br><br><b>Value for Money</b><br><br>35 dollars seems a little bit too much for this set. It could have easily been around 20-30 dollars. I mean, its a fun set, but its a little bit overpriced.<br><h4><b>Overall Rating</b></h4><p><br></p><p>A good set, yet it is a little bit overpriced but its fine. Nice pieces, nice playability, although ""nice"" is not ""great""!<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,3
