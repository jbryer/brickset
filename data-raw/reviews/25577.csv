<p>I love the air tanks and head piece it makes it look classic. If you remove the visors the figure still looks great. The flag accessory fits well. I like how the minifig as a whole pays homage to the beloved theme. I never go anywhere with him.</p>

<p>I have big plans for this Minifigure and he has founded plans for my first Lego layout.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To put it shortly if you love the Classic Space theme and love Legos this is definitely a must-have.</p>

<p>He&#39;s loaded with tiny detailing in his print, you&#39;ve got leg printing, side printing for the red red markings on his boots, a single-sided torso with a massive attention to detail for the controls of the space suit and the Classic Space logo on his breast. A white oxygen tank and gold shielded helmet complete the look.</p>

<p>You get a single-sided facial print fully bearded, I guess shaving in space isn&#39;t easy. Plus the awesome LEGO Classic Space flag as an accessory with a very nice silver print detail that makes it pop. This is a great Minifigure from the series, one of the best and most sought after, I&#39;d recommend snatching up multiples for parts as soon as possible if you haven&#39;t already. I really hope they use this print detail on a future figure, where&#39;s our Black Suited Spaceperson? It seems LEGO loves making green, blue, white and even pink space suits, but we haven&#39;t seen the traditional black suit in a long time. Not since the Series 3 Space Villain. Black doesn&#39;t mean evil, a good character can wear black too LEGO... But I digress, great figure LEGO.</p>

<p>Value for money:&nbsp; Depends on your personal impression of the value of a CMF.</p>

<p>Playability: An exquisitely detailed astronaut minifigure&nbsp;with a flag to plant?&nbsp; That&#39;s perfect for exploring many a strange new world and flying many a spaceship.&nbsp; I&#39;d like to get a few of these to crew an Apollo mission and the upcoming Watchpoint Gibraltar rocket.</p>

<p>Parts: Although the torso and legs sections work best together, they match the style of previous generations of Lego astronauts well enough that you could mix and match with City and Space astronauts without too much trouble.&nbsp; The gold-colored helmet visor is great in a variety of settings, and the white air tanks are always nice to have on hand.&nbsp; The Classic Space flag is a must-have for any NCS Moonbase, hangar, or Earth base build, and you can never have too many 4L bars.</p>

<p>Overall impressions: Although this astronaut carries a Classic Space flag, his spacesuit design is much more detailed and realistic than that of any minifigure from the Space theme.&nbsp; Instead, it emulates a real-world EVA suit like those from the 2011 and 2015 City Space sets and the 2017 Creator space shuttle.&nbsp; However, the red lines on the legs and arms bring to mind the lunar spacesuits of the commanders of the Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions, and the presence of the flag suggests that this astronaut has somewhere to go other than Earth orbit - the Moon.&nbsp; This is Lego&#39;s way of making an Apollo spacesuit without actually investing in a model of the lunar landings.&nbsp; I cannot recommend it highly enough.</p>
