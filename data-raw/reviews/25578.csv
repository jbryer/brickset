<p>The costom&nbsp;body, all the way up to the legs, is the highlight of the model, because it&#39;s very detailed and quite unlike other medieval torso&#39;s. The shield complements this well, and since I&#39;m a bit of a heraldy nut I&#39;m happy every time I spot a new shield design.</p>

<p>The color patterns of the shield don&#39;t really match that of the body, and it&#39;s a pity the mace is not one component like most other weapons, but I won&#39;t detract any points for that.</p>

This Frightening Knight is one again. Most of all I hope this will be a messenger of a new Castle bad guys faction !! And yes : with his looks he and <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItemInv.asp?M=cas256"">Vladek</a> could be related.</font></p>

<p><strong>Building 1 brick</strong> : assembling a mini figure can not be called building</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong> : A familiar helmet but for a Knight new shoulder armour. Legs and torso with a great print of course exclusively for this minifigure. The weapon is a new 2 part mace and what I like most is the new <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=bb626pb02&amp;idColor=77#T=P&amp;C=77"">shield</a>&nbsp;which reminds me of <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=3846pb16&amp;idColor=99#T=P&amp;C=99"">the shield of Sir Santis</a> in Knights Kingdom II that showed also a bear as blazonry. The face of this new bad guy reminded me of the <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=3626bpb0219&amp;idColor=3#T=P&amp;C=3"">grumpy grin of Lord Vladek</a> although this face is better and more detailed of course.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong> : Can be used in all your Castle sets and adventures, for a good bad guy bunch get several of them and reward the leader with a green or black cape.</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks</strong> : like all CMF&#39;s &euro; 3,00 is a reasonable price especially if it is a good one like this.</p>

He&#39;s fairly impressive and fits in quite nicely with the LEGO Kingdoms Dragon Knights from our last Castle inspired theme. The colours match fairly well.</p>

<p>This terrifying knight is dressed in a long dark green robe over his chain mail suit. He has dual-molded legs to represent his boots and his arm guards are printed on the sides of the arms. He&#39;s also sporting a single tooth sticking out of his dull unimpressed facial expression, and a scruffy looking beard. His shield is printed with a snarling bear, yes I do believe that is meant to be a bear and not a wolf. And he&#39;s got a buildable mace weapon to attack his foes with.</p>

<p>Overall the Frightening Knight looks extremely impressive. I&#39;d recommend getting a few of them, and owning at least one from this Series is a must because of the impressive level of detail. Strongly recommended.</p>

"lkb57","2017-09-26T06:28:02.57Z","A Perfect Addition to Any Castle Collection","<p>I have wanted this minifig from the moment from the moment Series 15 was announced. I&#39;m slowly building up a Castle/LOTR collection, and I was super excited to finally pick it up.</p>

<p>The design of the minifig&#39;s outfit is fantastic, with a green robe trimmed with dark green fur that is open on the front to reveal a chain mail coat. I think TLG did an excellent job illustrating the chain mail at this scale . . . too small and it wouldn&#39;t have shown up well, and any larger and it would have looked strange. The printing of the robe and armor is continued on the arms and legs.</p>

<p>The shield design is excellent as well, and will make a very versatile part of Castle MOCs. I was also excited about the mace, which is a fairly rare part, as far as I can tell.</p>

<p>In short, I&#39;m very pleased with this guy. I&#39;m planning on using the torso and legs to create another Rohan soldier for an upcoming MOC.</p>
