"8BrickMario","2016-02-16T21:38:00.477Z","This guy just never gets a break...at least, not a lucky one!","<p>The &quot;funny&quot; figure from Series 15, I decided to pick this one up due to the new parts and the creative concept.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Shiny orange. Instructions for neckwear. That is all.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Clumsy Guy introduces two new parts in the influx of new medical pieces; a head bandage and the crutch (two are included). The head bandages look nice, and the crutches can be held nicely at the bottom, top, or middle.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Clumsy Guy is that one guy who always gets injured in unfair ways, and at this point in time, he&#39;s gotten a concussion, a black eye, and a broken foot, all represented well. His face is printed with a very nervous grin, as if his optimism is just barely holding out, and his right eye is surrounded by a bruise and there are crossed bandages on his cheek. He&#39;s the first minifigure to have just&nbsp;<em>one</em>&nbsp;dual-molded leg, which forms his cast, and is nicely decorated on two sides with scribbled signatures which surely contain a reference to a LEGO employee somewhere. My absolute favorite detail about him is his shirt, which shows a wickedly grinning banana peel, symbolizing his &quot;the-world-is-out-to-hurt-me&quot; status in a classic comedic way. This also saves the character for me, turning him from potentially tragic to hilarious.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great figure. He&#39;s a funny concept, and he introduces some very useful parts. Get him while you can!</p>

Ouch.","<p><strong>Set #71011 Clumsy Guy:</strong> This is the first we&#39;ve seen of a certain accessory, before this MOC fans had to rely on building their own crutches. Series 15 is really starting out strong, the first four figures on the list are all very fun and impressive looking.</p>

<p>Clumsy Guy has a simple print, he has a single-sided torso with banana peel image on his shirt and a single-sided facial expression of a very tired and more than likely disappointed expression on his face. He has dual-molded arms which is nice and a single dual-molded leg to represent a cast with some signatures printed on the foot.</p>

<p>His head piece is a brand new bandaged look that Dengar has since borrowed for accurate costuming over in LEGO Star Wars, and he has those wonderful extremely useful crutches. I honestly can&#39;t recommend this guy enough, buy a small army of him if you can because those parts are all quite useful, enough to make me up the ratings for a CMF when I typically stick to a rating of one-star because it&#39;s just a Minifigure. If LEGO makes an inevitable Clumsy Girl I hope she&#39;ll at least look different enough to justify a re-use.</p>

"BlueStation","2017-06-11T03:57:05.01Z","My Comrade-in-Crutches","<p>Earlier this year, on a trip abroad, I suffered a freak injury to my leg. After the initial shock and anger, and an adventure of navigating foreign hospitals and willing myself home, I ended up with surgery, crutches, and time on my hands. Not my best vacation.</p>

<p>It was sometime during this time I was reminded of a collectable minifigure I had my eye on from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Collectable-Minifigures/subtheme-Series-15"">Series 15</a>, which I was not lucky enough to get when I had picked up a couple of the packs at that time. Looking for a sympathetic personification in LEGO to bring a couple of laughs to my pain, I had to track down <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71011-4/Clumsy-Guy"">71011-4</a>.</p>

<h3>The Minifigure</h3>

<p>There is not a weak spot to this figure. The facial expression, sporting cheek bandages, a black eye, and hapless survivor look, is apt. Pretty sure this was how I looked when I stepped off the plane.</p>

<p>The torso features a banana peel (perhaps implying the cause of his misfortune?) and dual-molded arms to indicate this is a banana peel t-shirt - looks great.</p>

<p>The legs feature one side dual-molded in white portraying a cast - this is on the left leg and even features printing of messages written on the cast. Looks like The Clumsy Guy and I had a very similar injury - my left leg has also been on the mend (I avoided a cast though!).</p>

<p>He comes complete with a bandage head piece, and even more impressively, crutches which I believe are brand new pieces and unique to this release. Hopefully he won&#39;t need them for too long!</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>This figure is absolutely outstanding and one of the highlights of the series. In fact I would say that figures like this are a primary advantage of the Collectable Minifigures.</p>

<p>Medical/hospital-related sets have been kind of rare of late in the City theme (an <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/41318-1/Heartlake-Hospital"">impressive hospital</a> was just released in the Friends theme), and often a medical-related set will include a generic city figure who is implied to have been injured, but for playability purposes (and likely to keep design costs down), that generic figure will not really show signs of any injury or treatment. The Clumsy Guy however is well-suited for Hospital and City MOCs in this role - he looks like he&#39;s been through a lot of treatment and needs more!</p>

<p>I went ahead and tracked down a companion figure, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8827-11/Surgeon"">8827-11 Surgeon</a> from 2012&#39;s <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Collectable-Minifigures/subtheme-Series-06"">Series 6</a>, and I now have that outstanding figure displayed next to 71011-4, no doubt explaining his predicament, diagnosis, and recovery timeline.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve gotten some much-needed laughs out from The Clumsy Guy. I&#39;m happy to report that I am recently crutches-free, and with another month or so of physical therapy I should be right as rain. The Clumsy Guy will now be a marker of this time in my life, and hopefully put a positive spin on what had started out a fraught experience.</p>

<p>Clumsy guy is a great figure that introduced two new moulds but also contains a very confusing Easter egg .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The Minifigure uses a bandage head attachment introduced with him , a weary face with a plaster and a black eye , his torso has dual moulded arms and a very evil looking banana peel and his legs have one that is dual moulded to represent a cast with many squiggles but you can make out two things , a smiley face and the signature of an individual called Mikey boi.........ok Lego , sure .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>The accessories include two crutch pieces introduced with him , they are quite nice and are in a silver colour . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a great figure with plenty of character and personality ( Mikey boi ) so I recommend it .</p>

"skywalkerfan52","2020-09-11T04:24:07.763Z","Random minifigure history review: Clusmsy guy","<p>Today&#39;s minifigure review is Clumsy guy from series 15 which released in 2016 and retails for $3.99 with one minifigure per bag. This was only available at retail stores from 2016 to 2017. This guy has bandages on his head like Dengar from Star Wars and has 2 crutches. He comes with a nice Banana short sleeved shirt which was probably the reason he got hurt in the first place because he slipped. He also has a cast on his foot that has a smiley face and signatures. On his face he has a black eye and bandages and a worried expression. I hope you enjoy this little history about the Clumsy guy.</p>
