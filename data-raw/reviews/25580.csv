<h3>Parts - 4 bricks</h3>

<p>The tribal woman comes with ultimately 1 new piece ,the baby, but then the majority of her pieces also have new printing</p>

<h3>The build - 1 brick</h3>

<p>Well it&#39;s a minifigure so not much can be said about &quot;building&quot; it.</p>

<h2>Value for money and playability - 5 bricks</h2>

<p>Well you do het some very nice pieces and indeed playability for a &pound;2.49 minifigure packet So ultimately I think the pricing is reasonable and good.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion - 5 bricks</h3>

<p>Overall this is a very detailed and in my opinion beautiful minifigure, especially if you&#39;re planning on making a native reenactment&nbsp;or village. All I need now is Lewis, Clarke and who ever the French Canadian was.</p>

<p>The Tribal Woman represents another Native American. Dressed in her traditional clothing she features impressive detailing on her single-sided torso print, with beads and tassels visible. Her dual-molded arms also feature tassel prints at the join between elbow and bicep. She features a simplistic design on the legs, but they are again dual-molded. Introducing the dual-mold legs has allowed LEGO to really go all out nowadays.</p>

<p>Her head piece is the same as the Series 1 Tribal Warrior, and the feathered accessory can be placed either in back or on top depending on preference. She includes a back bracket and the first ever LEGO Baby, beating out the new Infant piece introduced one Series later with Series 16. This infant is effectively wrapped in protective clothing and other elements.</p>

<p>Overall the Tribal Woman is quite impressive and I highly recommend finding her if you missed out when Series 15 was available.</p>
