<p>The Flying Warrior is made in mostly gold ABS plastics with fine printed detailing, he features a single-sided torso print for his armour, some leg printing on regular legs, no dual-molding for his boots this time. The print shows off a nice looking armoured skirt piece similar to Roman Soldiers, only in Gold.</p>

<p>Then we come to the accessories. I don&#39;t own him yet, so I&#39;m not sure if these were used first with Hawkman over in DC Super Heroes, but they do certainly look nice. The winged helm would make an excellent use for a Comics Accurate Thor, and the golden wings attach to a nice looking shoulder armour piece that is quite bulky, it hinders arm motions unfortunately so getting him to hold the spear accessory straight in an at-attention pose isn&#39;t possible. Perhaps a sword and shield would have served him better.</p>

<p>Really recommend getting this one, Series 15 has a lot of great figures and you&#39;ll definitely want them all if you haven&#39;t gotten them all yet.</p>
