I can&#39;t say I remember how I felt about LEGO&#39;s fantasy offerings in the early 00&#39;s, but between Elves and the CMF line they have blown that last decade out of the water. I never would have expected LEGO to make a minifigure catering exactly to my fantasy tastes... no wonder they&#39;re at the top of the game!</p>

<p>The Faun/Satyr comes with LEGO&#39;s very first pair of digitigrade minifig legs, with tufts of fur printed on the thighs and hooves on the feet. He sports a playful, almost weary grin on his face and an appropriate goatee. His torso is printed with a muscular build and more chest hair than I&#39;ve ever seen on a children&#39;s toy. A handsome set of curly horns and some floppy ears finish him off, and he carries a flute with five incredibly precise holes printed right on it. It almost feels like we&#39;re being spoiled by such specific new parts made for just one minifigure, but that extra mile is what really makes this unique figure shine!</p>

<p>The only problem is that the legs barely bend forward, making sitting impossible. It&#39;s a shame, but an acceptable sacrifice if it allows these legs to exist in the first place.</p>

<p>This guys is absolutely worth getting multiples of. He&#39;s a perfect fit in any fantasy forest and I plan on reusing the legs to make all sorts of custom figs, because my inner teen can&#39;t think of anything more delightful than a whole village full of fauns. I&#39;m happy to say the hairpiece looks just as good on a female face, so you can fashion a few lady fauns for your village as well!</p>

<p>The Faun is just the latest of the many exotic mythological creature we&#39;ve gotten out of the CMF line, and is in my opinion the best we&#39;ve seen since Medusa. Perhaps we&#39;ll even see an official lady faun somewhere down the road? I hope LEGO wrings that goat leg mold for all it&#39;s worth!</p>

"8BrickMario","2016-02-16T18:21:58.1Z","I'm rather faun-d of him!","<p>Mythology has always been an area of interest to me, so I was very excited to hear that we&#39;d be getting a faun in minifigure form. Having him now, I can say they did a great job!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The S15 packaging is attractive, making the orange different by using a metallic effect.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts on the Faun are pretty useful. His flute is a nice piece that can easily be used elsewhere. His hair is a great new piece molded in two plastics for the ears and the rest, and he has new legs which represent the shape of a goat&#39;s legs, and they look great in profile. Amusingly, the shaping of the legs gives them the opposite articulation; they can hardly bend forward, but backward, they go back much further.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Faun looks great. He&#39;s based on the Roman interpretation of the satyr, in which the creature is half-man, half-goat, and he certainly looks the part. His hair is nice and wavy, with a curl coming down from the forehead, and also includes his goat-like ears and some horns. His torso is printed to show a bare chest with some muscle detail and hair, and some fur at the bottom to blend into the legs. The legs themselves have some dark brown fur and hoof details printed on. His accessory is a flute;&nbsp;a bar piece printed with some holes.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a really nice minifigure. They lavished three new molds on him, and the result is great. I&#39;d recommend this to anyone with an interest in classical mythology and collectors of the mythological characters of previous series.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-04-19T19:00:30.567Z","I'm Mr. Tumnus... Or not.","<p><strong>Set #71011 Faun: </strong>This is one of the lower figures on the totem pole from Series 15, there isn&#39;t a whole lot you can do with him unfortunately, his legs are rather interesting and different from normal figures, but he really stands out in regular LEGO displays. He does look good next to all the other creatures we&#39;ve had in past&nbsp;CMF series&nbsp;though.</p>

<p>The Faun has a single-sided torso print that is a bare chested male chest, if not for the tufts of hair at the bottom of his waist this would be pretty useful, perhaps for a furry shorts wearing barbarian MOC if you want to re-purpose the piece. His hair piece is unique too and looks great, with spiraled goat horns on top and a tuft of curly hair, as well as the large almost elfin like ears.</p>

<p>His legs are brand new, with curved lower section for the more realistic look of the hooved Faun, there&#39;s a nice level of fur printing here too, they have one issue though. Like other creatures he doesn&#39;t have holes in the back to attach to studs for sitting, so he can only stand. The rod piece is printed with flute holes.</p>

<p>Overall one of the weaker offerings from the series, but still recommended if you&#39;re going for all sixteen. He&#39;s certainly not the worst figure in the line and I&#39;m certain his parts will be useful for creative individuals.</p>

"The_creative_box","2016-07-10T18:03:31.41Z","Neat little figure","<p>I bought this set at a BR store in Gothenburg, as I randomly grabbed a bag, hoping to get the faun minifig. And what did I found? read on too see my&nbsp;thoughts, but notice this is my first set review, so&nbsp;it might not be as good as other reviews here at&nbsp;Brickset.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A small foil package, colored in metallic orange, and a&nbsp;small instruction sheet which is the same size as those you&nbsp;get in polybags.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>6 parts (including the 3x4 plate). All pieces which makes up the body are unique, the legs was what i was most impressed of, as&nbsp;it is&nbsp;a brand new piece, featuring printed fur as well as hooves. They really capture the look of a faun&acute;s legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately the hairpiece, which looked&nbsp;great too, didn&acute;t fit very well on the head. Perhaps&nbsp;it was just the case on my figure, but it feels like the quality of Lego bricks is a litlle&nbsp;lower than it was&nbsp;before.</p>

<p>The minifigure comes equipped with a small flute.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The figure is very well decorated with fur on the legs, hair and muscles on the torso and an even better head with a grin which suits the character perfectly.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing special.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Awesome!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great figure for any Lego collector, especially for the ones&nbsp;who love fantasy creatures, such as those in Narnia. Just&nbsp;the legs justifies the&nbsp;purchase. To me this is one of the best figs&nbsp;from series 15.</p>

<p><b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;...he took&nbsp;</b><strong>out&nbsp;</strong>from its place on the dresser a strange little flute that looked as if it were made of straw and he bagan to play.&quot; C. S. Lewis, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Faun minifigure is the seventh minifig from series 15. And what a minifigure it is!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Being half goat and half man, the&nbsp;first most noteable thing is his legs. They are a special mold that are shaped like goat legs and are&nbsp;covered with little tufts of fur and he has two cloven hooves for feet that allow him to nimbly dance and spring and climb up steep cliffs. His chest is dotted with hair and the fur from his goat legs shows up at his waist. His face is happy and&nbsp;cheerful with a grinning mouth but the wrinkles by&nbsp;his eyes have a hint of sadness, as if he remembers better days long ago. He has a little brown goatee that suits him well.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;His hair is brown and curls every way, but is smothed down at the back. He sports&nbsp;two great curved goat horns on his curly head that distinguish him clearly as part goat and can be used for defense if needed. Then there are his long oval ears that sick straight ot and can pick up the slightest noise from far off.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;What is the hobby of a Faun? Dancing! Music! And that is just why this little forest creature carries a fine flute &quot;...that looked as if it were made of straw...&quot; and plays it almost wherever he goes. At one end of the flute is a half circular hole where he blows through and down the length of it are the holes he places his fingers in to play. His most moveing song is... the Narnia Lullaby. You can even hear this song by clicking the link at the top!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This minifigure does greatly resemble C. S. Lewis&#39; character in The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe called Mr. Tumnus. All the minifigure needs to look completely like Mr. Tumnus is a red scarf piece and a black umbrella piece to shield him and Lucy from the falling snow!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The only downside to the minifigure is that his goat legs will barely move forward so he can&#39;t really be sat&nbsp;down anywhere. But I suppose if a faun likes to dance he really doesn&#39;t have time to sit!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So,&nbsp;the conclusion is that this is a great minifigure for almost any one, whether you want to collect all the greek mythology creatures in the cmf series, recreate Mr. Tumnus, make a village of forest fauns, or simply want the useful parts this is one of the really good minifigures to collect in the series.&nbsp;</p>
