<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The same as every series we&#39;ve had so far.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>1st blind bag fig ive got with a double sided face (which is quite appropriate considering what she has to catch!). The hair piece, net &amp; skunk are all new for me &amp; i don&#39;t mind having two because i can display both women with different expressions @ the same time. Also the Hair piece looks like Sailor Jupiter&#39;s hair from Sailor Moon, which will be good for making custom figures!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The figure herself has good printing all over, on the sides of the legs (quite rare), badge on her right arm, short sleves on both arms &amp; good printing on her front but not&nbsp;her back, or the front of her pants. Of cource theres the face, 1 side has a weak smile with the eyes &amp; eyelashes suggesting the same expression, &amp; the 2nd is a puzzled oh no its a skunk&nbsp;expression.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very simple.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Like all blind bag figs theres not much at all.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Certainly a nice mini-fig &amp; one of the only female figs i have overall. The accessories &amp; prints all come together in this nice collectable mini-fig!</p>

She&#39;s just all around a must have character and it&#39;s mostly because of her included accessories.</p>

<p>Animal Control Officer has a single-sided torso with a nice useful uniformed print for official workers in LEGO City animal control, she does still have the curved waist for her torso so using this on any male workers will look odd, but it isn&#39;t as pronounced as other prints of this type. She also includes dual-molded arms with a logo printed on one arm and her legs may appear plain at first, but the sides have a line printed down for added detailing.</p>

<p>She includes a large net accessory to help her in her appointed task, however when she captures her smelly prey she&#39;s going to be repulsed by the scent, as evidenced by her dual-sided facial expressions, one happy the other with a disgusted expression.</p>

<p>The skunk is a brand new animal piece, it looks great and is a welcome addition to the LEGO Animal collection of pieces, it doesn&#39;t fit very well in the net though, probably why she&#39;s stuck in a foul mood after her odiferous prey has escaped to wreck havoc again.</p>

<p>Strongly recommend her, multiples are a must as well.</p>

<p>The animal control officer is pretty fantastic figure that introduces a Lego animal that I never knew that I wanted .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The figure uses the standard ponytail piece in dark brown , a happy facial expression and a very disgruntled one as well , her torso is nice but has no back printing and her arms are dual moulded with one of them having a print showing her profession in an insignia and her legs are dark tan and have side printing on each .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>The accessories include a net piece in white first introduced with this figure and a skunk with printing all over . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a good figure with a very complete design I just find the lack of back printing strange as that is a strange occurrence for a semi modern CMF series but I still recommend it .</p>
