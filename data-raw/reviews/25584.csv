"LilRed","2016-02-07T07:34:04.563Z","I shouldn't be mopping in here anyway...this is a rug.","<p>I have a general weakness for lego sets and figures that display civic services. A janitor, while not a glamarous job, is a perfect little addition to many lego&nbsp;sets.</p>

<p>His facial expression reflects this, sporting a tired almost zombielike&nbsp;expression. If there ever was a good reason to give a figure a coffee cup, this would be it. Unfortunately LEGO didn&#39;t provide him with one.</p>

<p>The Janitor has a nametag printed, though one can&#39;t make out his name, the torso printing shows a stained uniform that has seen better days. He even has rolled up his sleeves to really get down and dirty.</p>

<p>The legs are printed with a belt and a grease stained cloth, great to wash all those stained bathrooms and toilets.</p>

<p>His mop is nice to have as an alternative to the mini broom which we sure have seen in enough sets by now. (Specially if you are into civic services as I am)&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all; I am glad that the collectable minifigure series enables LEGO to make these more specialized figures with prints and accesories that normally wouldn&#39;t. This Janitor is no exception, I&#39;m actually really glad I got multiples.</p>

<p>The Janitor minifig features a plain uniform look with a dirty and splotched overcoat over a white shirt, he&#39;s wearing jeans and everything is a single-sided print. The familiar hat accessory is included here we&#39;ve come to expect ever since it was first introduced with the... Painter, I think it was the Painter or Decorator as the official name went. His mop can be attached either down or up to simulate the look of a mop in action and one damp and dripping dirty suds down the handle. He also has dual-molded arms for the short sleeved look.</p>

<p>Overall a good offering from CMF Series 15 with some useful parts and a fun overall look. The dirty rag hanging out of his pants pocket is a great touch and his mustache looks brilliant. Recommend this guy as always multiply for more parts.</p>

<p>The series 15 janitor is a figure that in theory should be really dull but Lego made this figure interesting .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The Minifigures has a sand blue hat , his face has a moustache , his torso has a jacket and the legs have a handkerchief&nbsp;</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>The accessory is a mop using a long redish bar and a mop end piece introduced with this figure . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a good figure that achieves what it needs to achieve so I recommend it .</p>
