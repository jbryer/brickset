"Zac","2016-11-25T20:31:23.92Z","Swanning Around the Stage","<p>This delightful minifigure represents a classical ballet dancer. She&rsquo;s exciting to me because of her tutu, a new part, but her appeal may be limited given that many people don&rsquo;t enjoy ballet or have never been to a ballet.</p>

<p>For those of us who like ballet, her details are a spot-on representation of a classical costume. The tutu&rsquo;s two layers simulate the many layers of net that give the dress its bounciness, although because of the minifigure&#39;s rectangular waist the tutu is amusingly distorted from its usual circularity. It looks fine from the side, as pictured, but is less recognizable as a tutu from other angles. The legs include printed ribbons and pointe shoes, while her hair is done up in a bun as is typical (to show the neck). The printed flowers on the hair piece are lovely. She&rsquo;ll make an excellent addition to the little ballet studio included in the upcoming Modular Buildings set (10255).</p>

<p>Some of Lego&rsquo;s previous stage-related minifigures have represented specific characters (8831-13, for instance, is clearly a stereotypical Wagnerian Br&uuml;nnhilde), but this ballerina&rsquo;s costume is relatively generic. She seems to be a member of the <em>corps de ballet</em>, and would fit in perfectly in the Bolshoi&rsquo;s <em>Swan Lake</em> and its justly famous <em>Grand pas des cygnes</em>.&nbsp;In this case anonymity is a benefit: unlike the vast majority of the Collectible Minifigures, it&rsquo;s desirable to have more than one ballerina in order to recreate any large-scale&nbsp;scene, in which uniformity is vitally important.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-04-24T22:28:52.13Z","Enter Swan Lake","<p><strong>Set #71011 Ballerina:</strong> Series 15 introduces another impressive minifigure that stands out yet again as a profession that has been inadequately represented in the past. The Ballerina is one of the better female offerings from the series, but honestly all of the female characters in Series 15 are must have.</p>

<p>Introducing a brand new ruffled looking skirt piece which fits between the legs and torso, the Ballerina has given the first non-soft-goods tutu. Her legs feature ballet slippers printed on the front and sides, with nothing else printed on. Her torso is a dual-sided print of a dress top with extra sequins detailing. She features a single-sided facial print with a big toothy smile and her hair has two berets (or flower decorations)&nbsp;printed on top. It&#39;s a brown version of the Sumo hairpiece if I&#39;m not mistaken.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d strongly recommend tracking this one down. She&#39;s got some nice pieces and multiples can fill out a nice dance recital display in any MOC LEGO City theater district. She may not have any accessories for the hand, which is a fairly rare occurrence in the CMF, however she looks stunning.</p>

<p>The ballerina may actually be my favourite Minifigure period , I don&#39;t know why I have no connection or interest in ballet dancing but I just feel as if this is just an incredibly well done figure .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The Minifigure uses the bun hair piece in dark brown with printing on it , a happy face print , a nice torso with nice silver details , a tutu hip attachment introduced with this figure and some legs&nbsp; with front and side printing including the feet .</p>

<p>The stand -&nbsp;</p>

<p>The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is just an incredibly well done figure but I don&#39;t fully know if it is my favourite , definitely in the realm of CMFs , but out of all figures I don&#39;t know I mean , other than series 10 series 15 is my most nostalgic series and this was my most wanted and I am pretty sure that you can tell that I highly recommend this figure to all Lego fans .&nbsp;</p>
