"8BrickMario","2016-02-16T21:50:10.497Z","Good? Or do we remove the ""c"" from ""Mech""?","<p>Well, no one asked for this! After the fairly original mecha-inspired&nbsp;Battle and Evil mechs, this one just seemed redundant. However, it may be salvageable.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts on this minifigure are truly excellent. His blue/silver/black colorscheme is great, and it works really well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is a pretty nice figure! His colors make me think that he may be a loose tie-in to the Ultra Agents theme, which sadly failed too soon. His armor is mostly black and silver, with some nice blue accents. He uses the techno-wings in transparent light blue with some nice black printing. His head is completely blank save for the zigzag line viewed through the helmet. His torso and leg printing really sell the figure for me, though, as they&#39;re decorated in a great muscle pattern including the blue and silver lines. Even without his armor, the figure looks great as a futuristic android, or perhaps an exo-suit for a human hero.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While the premise may seem a bit repetitive, I think the Laser Mech is almost better than his two predecessors. If you like sci-fi, then this is the figure for you.&nbsp;</p>

No doubt fuelled by some kind of electrical energy to stand against any foe. Honestly he&#39;s not one of the strongest offerings from CMF Series 15, however I do like the overall colour scheme and aesthetic.</p>

<p>Laser Mech includes some nice dark silver armour with a matching helmet, the armour piece is designed to clip on two unique wing pieces which tend to serve as blades on LEGO axes or Chima weapons. The torso and legs are printed with some nice armoured detailing highlighted with blue, the head has a wave pattern running across the front of the face, reminds me of soundwaves on old steroes.</p>

<p>His accessory is one of the elemental blades from Ninjago, it&#39;s a nice solid blue with a white lightning design in the center. I&#39;d suggest this figure would make an excellent addition for fans of mecha designs. Recommended.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The laser mech looks so futuristic , cool and menacing that I&#39;m surprised more people don&#39;t like it .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The helmet is very interesting with silver printing and an open area for the visor , the head has a sound wave looking print on a plain black head which looks so good paired with the helmet , the neck attachment has silver printing and two bars at the back to attach two Trans light blue wings , the torso has some zigzag printing that also continues into the legs .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>Its accessory is a blue lightning piece introduced with Ninjago . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a very good fig with fun prints and a very cool design and I recommend it but this was quite biased as this is from my favourite non licence CMF series .</p>
