"Hugh_s_Brix","2016-06-04T11:21:47.253Z","Series 15 Kendo Fighter","<p>My first series 15 LEGO minifigure&nbsp;and I must say, it&#39;s a really good one. Maybe my favorite along with the injured guy.</p>

<h3>Bag/Instructions</h3>

<p>The bag is the general series 15 bag. It is metallic orange with gold question marks on it. On the front it illustrates 9 of the series 10 minifigures. The collector sheet/ instructions has all 16 (as usual) on it. The back gives you instructions on some of the more complex characters.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are 7 parts to the set (including the stand). For a general minifigure the parts are descent. His swords come in a new colour, some off white colour. and the helmet has a nic re-decoration of an old part.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>I love this minifigure! Its awesome! One of my favorites! The legs are dark blue with some black detailing to simulate armor. His torso is dark blue with a very dark blue simulated cloth on his stomach. He has chains that hold armor to his torso. His arms are the same dark blue. Okey maybe&nbsp;it would be cool to have some back printing but that is about the only downside I can think of. His face is yellow with some facial hair detailing. His head has a lue headband on the top which appears through the helmet. Speaking of the helmet, it is so good. Okay it is the same mold as the Ninjago&nbsp;sets but this one has a new colour scheme. It is dark blue with a red stripe and a silver&nbsp;mesh face covering. If you look very closely at the helmet you can see dark blue strips that tie at the back of the helmet. He has the old Ninjago swords in a strange off white colour. (I don&#39;t know what colour it is, Im just guessing.) He comes with two of them.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fine. It is &nbsp;minifigure. Its too short to judge, but I enjoy building minifigures, so this one was good.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks really nice. There isn&#39;t really much else to say say about it, its a minifigure after all.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My overall opinion is that this is a great minifigure. One of my favorites (of the minigures&nbsp;series 15.) He is probably my second favorite behind the injured guy.&nbsp;</p>

What can be said about this particular character? Is he truly worth it? Honestly, he&#39;s not as exciting as the others in the series, but his accessories and overall look is very impressive.</p>

<p>With a single-sided torso print detailing his training outfit and the brief leg printing, the Kendo Fighter includes a familiar looking helmet accessory as seen in Ninjago, he&#39;s got two light tan katana to represent the wooden swords used in the art of Kendo and his facial print shows a serious and determined look with a blue bandana on top.</p>

<p>Overall I wasn&#39;t thrilled with him personally, but he completes the set and makes for a nice colour combination to display with LEGO Ninjago minifigures as an additional character. Make up a name and stick him in a set and you&#39;re ready to play out some fun adventure for the stoic looking Kendo Fighter. Mildly recommended.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigure has some great detailing on his front and back. He has a nice kendo helmet design and the tan swords just match the colors of the rest of him.</p>

<p>I also enjoy this minifigure because he can be used well with Ninjago.</p>

<p>Overall I would suggest this minifigure&nbsp;for any Lego fan!</p>

<p>The kendo fighter is a fine Minifigure with cool accessory recolours and detailed torso and legs printing .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure uses the kendo helmet introduced in Ninjago in an exclusive clout and printing , the head has an angry expression with a moustache and a head band and the torso and legs have his armour with the legs having especially subtle printing .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>The accessories are a nice recolour of the katana piece in light tan . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This is a fine figure which fills its spot as a middle ground CMF , the katanas are especially nice pieces add a fair bit of desire towards getting this figure so I recommend it .</p>
