Whether or not this is a deliberate cash-in on a meme, there&rsquo;s no denying that this fellow is full of his own fishy charm.</p>

<p>The shark body forms the main portion of the costume, with the dorsal fin and tail swooping elegantly down the back and the minifig face peeking out through two rows of teeth. He&rsquo;s got a light blue belly printing which extends, almost unnoticeably, up to the chin and snout of the shark. Combined with gills and eyes styled after Actual Lego Sharks, no detail is spared! Instead of arms, he has a pair of sleek fins to complete his outfit, an echo of the Chicken Suit Guy before him. Although he doesn&rsquo;t come with any extra accessories, he is one of only two figs in Series 15 to sport a double sided head. A casual grin on one side and a sweaty anxious grimace on the other, he perfectly encapsulates the two moods I cycle through the most!</p>

<p>One problem I noticed is that there are faint scratches on the back of the torso where the suit rubs against it. They are minor and don&rsquo;t ruin the play experience at all, but it&rsquo;s worth noting if you like to keep your minifigs pristine.</p>

<p>This guy is a lot of fun to play with. Swoosh him around like he&rsquo;s swimming or decorate your aquarium with him, or gift him to the ocean aficionados in your life. Have him lurking around the boardwalk in your Lego town, or build him his own little home under the sea. He&rsquo;s fun just to carry around with you!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t usually mention the packaging for CMFs, but I think it&rsquo;s worth noting in this case how well the orange of Series 15 contrasts with his medium blue. The shark is clearly meant to be the star of the series, so putting him against an eye-catching complimentary background color is a very smart design choice.</p>

<p>Shark Suit Guy is a treasure from the briny deep, so snap him up while you can!</p>

<p>5 parts, one is one of those black stands, which I&#39;m not using. he&#39;s got legs in a color I&#39;ve never had, probably useful. then he&#39;s got the shark hat, which tails all the way down ( &quot;tails&quot; ! get it? ) to his legs. i like it. if you replace his yellow head with a black head, then he could be some sort of shark mutant. his head is double-sided, with a jolly, cheerful expression on one , side and a scared, sweaty face on the other.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t really play with him, but you could put him in a circus or with your other animal suit minifigs to display him. <em>my </em>Sharky is currently strolling along the sidewalk of the Detective&#39;s Office.</p>

<p>not much to build, cuz there&#39;s five parts.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t complain about the Value for Money because my dad bought him.</p>

<p>Overall, I like him, but then again, I like all my Legos.</p>

<p>tanks for reading!</p>

And this time it&#39;s a dangerous man-eating shark... Better look out, Jaws can walk.</p>

<p>Shark Suit Guy has minimal printing, he&#39;s got a minor bit of marking on the front of his torso and the rest is clear of printing. He&#39;s got a really nice lighter blue colour, and two fins in place of standard LEGO arms. His head piece is very nicely detailed with sculpted gills and printed eyes, as well as&nbsp;a painted white teeth and a minor print that matched up with the torso decoration on his chin. He includes two facial expressions; smiling and happy or nervous and slightly frightened.</p>

<p>Strongly recommended folks, you can&#39;t go wrong with this character. He makes for an excellent addition to any collection, and if you&#39;re a fan of Katy Perry you&#39;ll enjoy adding him to your display for a Super Bowl show.</p>

<p>The shark suit guy of a costume figure that works and introduced a nice new arm mould .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figure uses a shark head attachment introduced with him in 2016 that was later used for orca from the batman movie series one , it has eye printing , his head showcases a happy facial expression and a scared sweating expression for when he is being stuck in a hot suit or being eaten alive , his torso is simplistic but his arms are a piece introduced with this figure as they represent also later used by orca from the batman movie series one and his legs are left printless .</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a good suit figure as it is actually based on a Lego piece or&nbsp;set of pieces ( I&#39;m talking to you elephant girl , plant pot girl , corn on the cob&nbsp;guy , panda guy , gorilla guy&nbsp;and lama suit girl ) so therefore I recommend it .</p>
