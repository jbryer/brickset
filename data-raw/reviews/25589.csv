One of them inevitably becomes the lowest one on the totem and in this case I fear Wrestling Champion just doesn&#39;t do enough to stand out.</p>

<p>While he may be a weak link he&#39;s definitely not unimpressive to look at as far as the printing and detail work is concerned. He&#39;s sporting a pair of light blue trunks on his dual-molded legs and includes a championship belt on his bare-chested torso. The torso is dual-sided and features side-printing on the arms for some fancy looking straps. He has a teeth gritting expression as he holds his trophy accessory up triumphantly and features the first ever LEGO mullet, a great hair piece.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d mildly recommend this one if you&#39;re a wrestling fan, if not he&#39;s safe to skip unless you want a complete set of sixteen.</p>
