She&#39;s one of the best offerings from the Series and another stellar female character.</p>

<p>Her detailing is difficult to make out in muted lighting, but she&#39;s dressed in a black &#39;spy&#39; suit or cat suit, it&#39;s all single-sided printing on the torso with muted blues as well as the black and simple printing for the legs with some kneepads. She includes a diamond and a grapple gun for accessories and is sporting a wicked little smirk with a black mask on her face. Single-sided print of course. And as noted she&#39;s wearing the Black Widow&#39;s hair in black.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend picking her up, her parts are dead useful for some nifty female spy figures and her hair is only available in expensive sets from Marvel Super Heroes, granted it&#39;s in a red colour scheme, but it&#39;s still a rare hair piece.</p>
