"8BrickMario","2016-02-16T18:02:05.927Z","She rules-oh, wait. I already used that joke...","<p>While Series 15 left a surprisingly subdued emotional impact on me upon its reveal, I still enjoyed many of the figures, and the Queen here (why she&#39;s not the&nbsp;<em>Classic&nbsp;</em>Queen, I can&#39;t say) was at the top of my list.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Series 15 returns us to the orange color scheme, which is rather disappointing, but at least it&#39;s been saturated and metallicized, which creates a nice shiny effect. The instructions have continued the instructions from S14, showing the less intuitive assemblies (the Queen&#39;s cape, the Laser Mech&#39;s wings, and the Flying Warrior&#39;s wings).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Queen has some pretty nice pieces. Her cape is the same as the Classic King&#39;s, and her torso could be useful. I was delighted to see the return of Calamity Drone&#39;s hair, as I had missed out on it the first time, and I was surprised to find that it is solid ABS plastic, not rubber. The big new part here is her dress, though, which is a wide poofy style with a flat front and a curved back. Underneath the brick is a 2x2 tube configuration used on most 2x2 bricks, and the sides are hollow to make sure the clutch isn&#39;t too powerful. Of course, the best part is that this piece includes torso pegs which keep the dress securely attached to the body.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Queen herself looks excellent. Her hair is very regal, with a wavy style and a bun and elegant ringlets on the back. Her hair fits a tiara quite nicely. The Queen&#39;s face looks very wise and kindly (good qualities in a ruler), and her cape, while reused, is perfectly appropriate. Her torso has a nice gold-and blue pattern over the red dress, showing a vaguely floral design.&nbsp;Her dress continues the pattern, adding a bit of a playing-card motif with the hearts and diamonds along the bottom, which fits the colors perfectly.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great figure. She&#39;s a really nice stand-alone, but when paired with her husband, she&#39;s even better. I&#39;d definitely recommend getting her.</p>

"Fauch","2016-02-25T22:42:32.64Z","good parts, under average prints","<p>The queen comes with a new mold for legs. The hair I had never seen before but I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s new. The cape appears for the 2nd time I think, after the serie 13 king.</p>

<p>The queen is only printed on the front and the pattern is relatively simple, no particularly subtle details that would be hard to see on a picture. The sides and back are unprinted, plain bright red.</p>

<p>The leg piece is flat on the front and rounded on the other sides. it is 4x2 wide but is only held by 4 studs underneath. It is the same height as normal legs, which is nice since it&#39;s weird to see lego&nbsp;women tower over men.</p>

<p>Very nicely moulded hair with a hole on top for an accessory. The tiara is good but not new, I have several of them.</p>

<p>The cape is made of 2 parts, the red one and the white one. they are attached by 3 points, which forces them into a specific shape, like it&#39;s floating behind the figs. At least it looks so on other minifigs, but with the specific legs shape of the queen, it seems to just follow her curves naturally. I tried the white part with other capes, it worked ok, but since they are attached by 2 point, and the white fluff by 3, that doesn&#39;t fit perfectly.</p>

<p>Now for the flaws, first, there is a noticeable gap between the leg prints and the torso prints. It looks to be at least 1mm. My queen also has a misprint. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s really visible on my picture, I outlined in blue a portion of the torso. For some reason, this portion has a slight shift, it is asymmetrical and so doesn&#39;t fit the legs perfectly.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-04-25T01:40:57.28Z","Her Highness, Queen of England!","<p><strong>Set #71011 Queen:</strong> We received a Classic King in an early series of minifigures. So it was only a matter of time before they gave us a companion for him and what a magnificent looking minifigure she is.</p>

<p>The Queen looks very regal in her flowing red robes with a blue inner robe with floral printing. To match up with the Classic King she&#39;s wearing a red cape and a white collar piece. Her hair is new and includes a gold crown that just plugs in with a hole on top. Her lower torso is a brand new piece as well, massive and designed to act like a regular LEGO brick. She has no accessories, a royal cane or staff or something might have been nice to see.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend her, she doesn&#39;t fit in anywhere aside from a Classic Castle theme, but she looks good and compliments the Classic King, I believe from Series 13, quite nicely. Good job LEGO, all we need now is a Prince, a Pauper and maybe a few more types of Knights to make a fairly fun looking Castle Themed display set.</p>
