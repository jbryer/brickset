<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A typical blind bag. I was able to find the farmer by feeling for the pitchfork.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A very good parts selection here. Everything can easily be reused. Double-colored legs are a pretty cool part to have, in my opinion, as is the pig.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure is a pretty cool figure, as a whole. I wasn&#39;t expecting him to be great, as I got this for the pig, but he&#39;s better than I expected. There is plaid printing&nbsp;on his arms, a Spielberg head, nice hat, two-colored legs. Wow!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s just a farmer.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks great</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Fun figure. There&#39;s been farmers in other themes before, but none have the stereotypical charm that this one has!</p>

<p>Good parts. my dad got this guy especially for the pig, which does disappoint. the pig is quite adorable, with spots of mud upon his eye and assorted places on his body, and he has a stud on his back, which the farmer is currently sitting on, doing some good-ole-fashioned pig wrangling. I&#39;m planning to make and exo-suit for the pig, so he can defend himself against the unknown dangers of the Detectives Office, which this set graces along with the Shark Suit Guy. The pig can&#39;t stay on one stud, so you have to put him on four ( he can&#39;t stand right . . . all the more reason for an exo-suit ) . Anyway, the farmer has dual-molded legs ( ooh! ), arm printing ( sweet! ) and some normal torso printing of overalls and a plaid green shirt. His face has kind-looking eyes behind some glasses, a darkish grey beard, and ( goes without sayng ) eyebrows. His hat i really like, and uses the same mold as the Scarecrow in S11, although without the printing. It&#39;s made of the nougat color in many, many Minecraft sets, and has a texture that feels new for some reason unknown to myself. And he has a pitchfork in reddish brown, which is nice, because this is my first pitchfork piece.</p>

<p>One minifigure, which I have previously described to you. Great fig.</p>

<p>Overall, really nice. That pig will have an exo-suit yet.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-04-19T17:24:51.883Z","E I E I O","<p><strong>Set #71011 Farmer:</strong> Series 15 continued the impressive traditions of LEGO CMF and for its first slot we get a pretty decent deal, the Farmer is a simple design, but he includes a LEGO Pig and the price hadn&#39;t raised yet so it was pretty good bargain for your dollar.</p>

<p>The Farmer features dual-molded legs with a light-blue upper section and lower brown boots. His torso includes some nice side-arm printing with a patchy looking pattern that reminds me of some flannel shirts. The facial print is decent enough with an old man&#39;s beard and mustache and a nice pair of spectacles. For accessories you get the Scarecrow&#39;s hat (so you can attach a Crow to his hat as well due to the hole on top) and a regular LEGO pitchfork.</p>

<p>The pink and brown splotched piggy is nice, although it&#39;s a bit darker in tone than the image would seem to indicate. Perhaps a change in colour parts was made before production began. Overall a fairly decent offering from Series 15 and one worth tracking down for some fun Farm displays in MOC Cities.</p>
