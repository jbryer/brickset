<p>The bag the parts are bagged is an excellent example of minimalist packaging, and the bag is reseal-able too.</p>

<p>Instructions are minimal - the star destroyer is complete within 3 steps, and the TIE fighter in just one. Interestingly, the Star Destroyer instructions are all shot from a 3/4 view, and the TIE fighter is actually made with it facing upwards.</p>

<p>Please note that the model shots used to promote the set, the round 1x1 stud plate used on the Star Destroyer command post is actually used on the TIE fighter.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are no standout parts in the build, and no spares are included, which caused me to go on the floor when the translucent stud round plate used for the TIE fighter made an escape bid.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing out the ordinary, and with 21 parts, it&#39;s a simple build, taking me less than a minute to complete.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>What immediately sticks out - from the fact panel included in the magazine - is that the Star Destroyer can fit 72 TIE fighters within itself, so clearly the scales are completely different, which almost makes me suspect the individual models were considered separately and combined because on the own they seemed to be too small an offering.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For the price of the magazine, this is an excellent &#39;freebie&#39; and sure to keep kids (and adults) &#39;swooshing&#39; them by.</p>

<p>The micro star destroyer and TIE fighter are a combo that works but also doesn&#39;t with scale .</p>

<p>The builds-</p>

<p>The builds , starting with the star destroyer has a 2&times;4 plate as a base , some angle wing plates ontop for the dagger like design , a modified plate at the back which features the three main&nbsp; thrusters in which the middle protrudes more than the other , there is further wing plate building ontop and it leads up to a peculiar bridge using a 1&times;1 clip . The TIE fighter uses a 2&times;2 black tile for each panel and a 1&times;1 snot brick for the middle with thrust at the back and a windshield at the front .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a good set of builds but not one I would rush out to get , but if you like the look of it then I recommend it to those who do so .</p>
