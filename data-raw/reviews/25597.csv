"bitsyww2","2016-01-28T17:50:57.067Z","Oh the details!","<p>I grew up with the Ghost busters movies and cartoons and I loved this set! This is also one of my first set reviews despite being an AFOL for years and owning several of the&nbsp;advanced sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions: The box isn&#39;t the clearest about what side opens. &nbsp;It took a couple seconds to puzzle it out just from the outside. &nbsp;I really like the new format of a bound book for the larger lego sets instruction manuals. It makes them so much easier to use and page through.&nbsp;I thought the horizontal orientation of the manual was a good choice and helped the build flow really well. &nbsp;I did think their were a couple times where steps could have been easily combined but overall it wasn&#39;t too simplified.</p>

<p>Parts: there was a big variety in pieces. &nbsp;A lot of nice dark red and smooth bricks. &nbsp;I liked the fire pole piece.&nbsp;I actually received two in my set,&nbsp;one was slightly curved&nbsp;but looked like it could be straightened&nbsp;easily. I wish there would have been more printed pieces and fewer stickers. &nbsp;I&#39;m really not a sticker fan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: &nbsp;I love them all but my favorite is probably Jeanine. &nbsp;Lego&nbsp;managed to capture her distinctive bemused smirk really well. &nbsp;The ghosts are a really standout feature too. &nbsp;All the images show them mounted on the outside but I opened up the firehouse and was able to find all sort of places to mount them so it looks like they are buzzing around the interior. &nbsp;Most importantly Slimer can be attached to the fridge door by his hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: This was a lot of fun. I really like mini builds and this set is absolutely loaded with them. &nbsp;The toaster and the arcade game are great little builds. As is the fire alarm. &nbsp;I loved how the kitchen came together from all of the tiny pieces.&nbsp; I found it challenging and some of the techniques&nbsp;were new to me. Over all I felt the build used&nbsp;new and old techniques blended nicely to keep it&nbsp;interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually did not find the walls to be all that repetitive&nbsp;especially when compared to something like the Grand Emporium. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately there is one part of the build I truly hated and despised and wish hadn&#39;t been included. &nbsp;The trash can on the street is stupid&nbsp;and I hate it WAY more than I should. I couldn&#39;t get the pieces lined up and when I tried to put it place it kept flying apart. &nbsp;After some not so nice language I decided it wasn&#39;t necessary. That thing can go straight to the spare parts bin. &nbsp;No five pieces of Lego should ever be the annoying :)</p>

<p>The completed model: &nbsp;The detail is freaking outstanding. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know why I&#39;m so stuck on the toaster but it sits on little pink ectoplasm dots, there is shampoo and soap in the shower, the kitchen is stocked, Egons lab shelves have all sorts of tools and specimens on them. The lockers actually hold the proton packs and open. &nbsp;I wish the containment unit was more prominent but that&#39;s minor complaint as it still actually opens and you can put a trap in it. &nbsp;My husband is not an AFOL and he came over and was commenting on all the details. &nbsp;From the fire extinguisher in the upstairs hall to the alarm bell and AC units in some of the windows it&#39;s just remarkable.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a huge fan of how the second and third stories attach&nbsp;on the right side when open. It&#39;s a bit tipsy and could be more stable with additional hinges.&nbsp;I also wish that side opened 180 degrees instead of just 90. I also would have liked the hinged walls to be flush with the edge of the base.&nbsp;I didn&#39;t care for the sidewalk wrapping around three side of the building. &nbsp;Also the back is just bad. &nbsp;There&#39;s&nbsp;no&nbsp;avoiding it, it&#39;s obviously done to keep costs down, it just is what it is. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall opinion: I really liked this set and found it to be a good value. &nbsp;At first&nbsp;I was put off by the price and unsure it would live up to the tag and hype. &nbsp;I feel like it surpassed my expectations all around. &nbsp;I truly enjoyed it and would have no problem recommending it to someone who was on the fence about buying it. &nbsp;The details really make up for all the things I dislike, well except maybe for that trash&nbsp;can ;)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only thing that really lets this set down is the way they&#39;ve decided to have the building open. All of the hinges are on the bottom floor except for one at the roof and the different floors aren&#39;t very well connected. I&#39;ve found that I had to order extra hinges and replace some of the tiles with regular Lego bricks so that when I open the upper floor, the bottom two come with it.</p>

"teambeamer","2017-09-26T05:43:32.1Z","Delightful Build and Building!","<p>This was one of my most enjoyable builds, I spent 3 days and loved&nbsp;every minute! An absolute must for&nbsp;every collector and AFOL, there was nothing but total&nbsp;joy in this! &nbsp;All the pieces were fun to see come together, although pay careful attention to the garage walls, that was a slightly confusing area. The overall product is amazing and priced very well. My favorite set so far!</p>
