<p>How does this figure stack up? Let&#39;s read on.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overview:</strong></p>

<p>The figure was released with a deluxe edition of the LEGO Star Wars The Force Awakens video game in 2016. So far this appears to be the only product this figure is officially&nbsp;tied to.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p>The figure comes in a polybag and as such is simple to assemble. But it fares well with the weathered First Order Stormtrooper prints front and back. The figure also comes with the same head as that of the Finn minifigure released on the Falcon and the Battle of Takodana sets of 2015 and 2016 respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see aside from the weathering and the lack of a helmet his print is the same as that of a regular FO Stormtrooper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For TFA completionists this figure is likely a must-have as it allows one to recreate FN-2187&#39;s desertion from the First Order.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For anyone else the code on the polybag cover is widely known and it&nbsp;gives you access to the same figure in the video game it was released with itself so there is not much you are missing out on. If you have a regular Finn from another set you can swap his head out with a regular trooper&#39;s and recreate any scene you wish.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>I like The Force Awakens so I am very glad to finally have a copy of this figure in LEGO form, however, he is not for everyone so you are not missing much if you have plenty of First Order Stormtroopers and a Finn figure from other sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, he is lacking a helmet, probably lost in the TIE fighter he deserted on, but I am sure its inclusion would have made many folks happy. Overall this polybag is on the average end of the spectrum, though I do greatly appreciate the weathering on the armor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Firstly I will talk about the parts.Only five parts come in this poly bag.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The weapon is a standard, medium sized blaster that can fit inside Finn&#39;s hand. I think this is a good weapon for Finn because it is nothing too over the top and just works well.</p>

<p>The torso and legs have a design that suggests that he is wearing rusted armour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hair is&nbsp;black. The head is double sided. One side has a straight face and the other is a kind of shocked face.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Overall, I think Finn is such a good character and a really good character to make in Lego. And they have made a great polybag here that I am really lucky and happy to own.</p>

<p>Hope everybody liked my review! :)&nbsp;</p>
