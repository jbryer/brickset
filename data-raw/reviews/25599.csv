<p>One of the many polybag Star Wars releases. &nbsp;After getting my kids the Tie Fighter polybags for Christmas, this just seemed like a no brainer. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Nothing spectacular. &nbsp;The orange and silver pieces stick out on this model, as well as the clear pink pieces used for the engines.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very straight forward. &nbsp;Pretty ingenious build for centering the cockpit and front of the ship off the rear engine build. &nbsp;It all stays together relatively well too.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Classy. &nbsp;Captures the look and feel of Poe&#39;s X-Wing in small scale. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My boys each have their own, and now have two more. &nbsp;This might be their favorite polybag ship so far. &nbsp;And most have an extra orange circular one stud piece which they attach as BB-8. &nbsp;</p>

The colours alone for Poe&rsquo;s X-Wing really make it pop and this scale is very good for the build in question. The material included in the DK Reprints with this set is basically the same, however some new material was added for the Resistance X-Wing sets produced in this scale, microfighter scale and I believe the larger Minifigure scale version as well. It is a decent set and worth tracking down, I&rsquo;d strongly recommend it.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>This set comes in a normal polybag with normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You only get one part worth mentioning. You four trans pink cones, which are used as the energy coming out of the engines which look really cool. The black and orange colors with a little bit of dark grey and silver work really well together to capture the Sequel version of the X-Wing Starfighter. The total piece count for the set is 64.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is another really good polybag from Star Wars. They have consistently produced good quality polybags that resemble the larger scale models. The orange and black colors look and work well together. The trans pink cones are great to get as they aren&#39;t overally common. The wings are a little flimsy and can fall off at times. The wings can move around a little over 90 degrees. I highly recommend this set to any Star Wars fan/collector. This set will also make a nice addition to anyones Lego collection. This is another very good polybag from Star Wars. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Denthur","2020-03-22T07:00:39.317Z","Nice microscale display piece","<p>Got this set for free with a kids magazine in 2016, pretty good deal for $7</p>

<p>The pros:</p>

<p>Parts are nice, especially the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6125698"">trans-medium reddish violet cones</a> on the back. Fairly accurate to the T-70 for a microscale, and it feels really sturdy on the nose. Looks great alongside other microscale vehicles</p>

<p>The cons:</p>

<p>The wings feel a bit loose when you move them, and the design for them is repetitive and finicky, especially when lining the plungers up on the ends. The back of the model also feels too big compared to the front</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>4/5</p>
