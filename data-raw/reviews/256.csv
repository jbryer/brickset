It also comes with lot's of stuff like a catapult, a staff which you can use to move the car, some flood light, a camera and a ramp with a barrier. The camera and the flood light sviwel and the car looks really cool with the engines on the front. I also like the rear wing and the cockpit of the vehicle. The barrier is also very neat desinged. If the car hits the barriers the ground will disappear which is a cool feature of this set.<br><br>The stuntman minifig has a black suit with a zipper, a black helmet and the same face which we've seen on the LEGO Rock Raiders character Sparks. The cameraman has a nice white suit with some cool markings on it and a 'cameraman' printing on the back. He has a blue cap and blue pants and the face is the same which we've seen on the LEGO Rock Raiders minifig Docs. It's a great set to build and it's very sturdy. You also don't need to worry about stickers.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
