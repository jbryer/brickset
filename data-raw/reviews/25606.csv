<p><strong>The luggabeest is an excellent build</strong> - I tried to assemble it without using the instructions and quickly realized that this was impractical due to the large&nbsp;number of parts assembled using fairly complex SNOT techniques. &nbsp;I followed the instructions and was impressed by the solid construction and clever tricks used. &nbsp;It also features great colors which aren&#39;t as common in recent models. &nbsp;It&#39;s a 10/10 excellent model.</p>

<p>The play structure is a simplified re-creation of the structure on Jakku where Rey sells parts in exchange for &quot;portions&quot; of food. &nbsp;It is not terribly faithful to the movie, but does include some clever play features such as opening up to access the interior of building, and a hidden compartment with a gun. &nbsp;It is lackluster compared to the Luggabeest;&nbsp;<strong>a pretty average 5/10 rating for the&nbsp;play structure.</strong></p>

<p>The set is not&nbsp;a very good value at a retail price of 59.99, but it felt like a fair value at 25% off so I gave it a try.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion, <strong>I think this would be an even stronger set if the Unkar Plutt&nbsp;structure and figure were excluded and the price were around 35$</strong>, but the play features are actually pretty well thought out for this relatively small set.</p>

"Mr_T","2017-03-08T04:31:28.67Z","Amazing set, but a bit too expensive","<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Highly playable</li>
	<li>Luggabeast is a gorgeous build and the new leg mold just makes it perfect. The head tilt is a bit limited, but captures the look and feel of the &quot;beast&quot; (specially when it&#39;s angled down)</li>
	<li>The folding of the tent is just amazing for storing and reducing the foot print of the set</li>
	<li>The plastic sheet tent like roof works perfectly well and I don&#39;t think it could be done with regular pieces</li>
	<li>Has a great atmosphere, mostly due to so many small details all over the stall: a weapon, mug, jar, studs for the weapon, a safe with food &quot;portions&quot;, bars all over the windows, light on the wall, the hidden gun (with very nicely designed lock mechanism), the droids parts, etc</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s an expensive set, not just in terms of price per parts, but once built it&#39;s quite small in overall volume for the&nbsp;price tag</li>
	<li>I don&#39;t like the exposed liftarms, specially the light gray one</li>

This set features two figures we&rsquo;ve seen before and two brand new figures, which isn&rsquo;t terrible, until you see the price of the set. I feel LEGO really missed the mark on the price-per-piece ratio on this front, for a set representing Jakku and Unkar Plutt&rsquo;s exchange station scene it&rsquo;s certainly missing a few things. A large cast of characters would have helped it greatly, however it&rsquo;s still a decent enough set as we&rsquo;re about to delve into.</span></span></span></span></p>

A large electro pike accessory is included which is built up with three elements, a LEGO nozzle piece, black lightsaber hilt and flagpole element. Definitely not a bad little accessory, at least it isn&rsquo;t a stud shooter.</span></span></span></span></p>

The head is equally full of greebling and detailing with some very nice steps to add all of the details. Two printed circular tiles are used for the eyes. Overall a great fun build for an awesome model.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s a fairly quick build with only a few repetitive steps. Nothing struck me about it here, but as always, I strongly suggest building on a solid surface and not somewhere like a bed or anything similar, as it does cause issues of attaching the parts.</span></span></span></span></p>

Basically this is the front, previously you were constructing the back of the structure. Nothing too difficult here, aside from the roof section, as it attaches with Technic pins you will need to push both in around the same time to avoid any breakage, or stressed parts, once it&rsquo;s attached though you&rsquo;ll be done and ready to start bag five.</span></span></span></span></p>

Once everything is done it&rsquo;s time to attach the soft plastic awning to the entire build, this moment may require a little help to make sure it goes on alright, but I doubt it&rsquo;d be that difficult.</span></span></span></span></p>

Not a lot of play features here though, you have a stud shooter for Unkar, but there&rsquo;s also a slide-out section with a hidden regular blaster, which means he can fire with two weapons when facing against Rey. Hidden amongst the various locations are enough parts to build an Old Republic era Battle Droid, extra defense against intruders perhaps.</span></span></span></span></p>

This is a terrible price for this set, the model is not as large or involved compared to other 75$ sets, even taking into consideration the pricing of Star Wars sets this does not justify such an asking price.</span></span></span></span></p>

I got this through Costco during 2017&rsquo;s holiday season and I believe it had been marked down to 50$ or even lower than that, my mother got it for me as a sort of Christmas present. (I opened and built it long before December 25<sup>th</sup> though, AFOLs sometimes don&rsquo;t stick to just opening stuff on Christmas Day.)</span></span></span></span></p>

Fans of The Force Awakens who wanted Unkar Plutt as a Minifigure had to buy this set, if it was 75$ though I still feel it needed at least two more Minifigures, possibly Finn who was also in this scene and maybe another Unkar&rsquo;s Thug or even First Order Stormtrooper just for added play. I feel the new leg parts for the Lugga Beast may have tipped the price up a bit since they are brand new, but considering they re-used them in the 25$ Black Panther set they couldn&rsquo;t have cost that much to engineer and produce.</span></span></span></span></p>

Not sure I&rsquo;d recommend it for folks looking for this set on the secondary market since it doesn&rsquo;t really offer much outside of the Unkar Plutt Minifigure and the Lugga Beast mold.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Loadaimshot","2017-08-23T15:56:59.943Z","Better than expected","<p>When this set was announced I thought, firstly, that it was way overpriced (Norwegian list price&nbsp;is 799 NOK = 79 GBP / 110 USD(!)), and secondly, that it didn&#39;t look to be&nbsp;up to TLGs standard. The only reasons I purchased this set was because it was on sale (60% off), and I thought that it would make a decent mini display combined with 75099&nbsp;Rey&#39;s Speeder. I am happy to report&nbsp;that I actually was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p>The set is divided into five parts, two&nbsp;for the Luggabeast and three for Unkar Plutts&nbsp;shack. The Luggabeast&nbsp;is a fantastic little build. The&nbsp;dark azur pieces, though not exactly true to the original,&nbsp;makes it standout and I think it&nbsp;looks quite good. The shack starts well. There are some nice details on the corners&nbsp;and the brick yellow entrance gate (at least I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s supposed to represent), though simple, has a&nbsp;nice&nbsp;shape. Then comes the roof... It is made up mainly by&nbsp;a 8X8 Grid Plate and a unique printed plastic &quot;sail&quot;, perched on top of technic beams. The beams coupled with technic pins sticking up and out, looks awful. I get that it supposed to be a shack&nbsp;for scrap scavenging on a desolate&nbsp;planet, but it&#39;s just not right. Maybe if the &quot;sail&quot; had been made out of cloth and had pieces hanging down it would have looked more authentic (?), just a thought.</p>

<p>When it comes to minifigures&nbsp;the selection is quite good. Both Teedo and Unkar&nbsp;Plutt are exclusive to this set, and until the release of 75178&nbsp;Jakku&nbsp;Quadjumper this was the cheapest set to include BB-8.&nbsp;Rey isn&#39;t particularly interesting, but of course has to be included in a set of this kind.</p>

<p>Other than the roof construction, I actually&nbsp;found this set to be a relatively fun build, with some good parts and nice, though not exactly innovative, techniques. The biggest problem, in my opinion, is the price point. At list price (at least the Norwegian price), the set should have included a couple of hundred parts more, or like 3 or 4&nbsp;minifigs. However, because I got it at such a&nbsp;reduced price, I am not really entiteled&nbsp;to complain.</p>
