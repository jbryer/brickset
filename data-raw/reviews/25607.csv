I ended up with one anyway when when my sister egged me to complete the Rogue One cast during a holiday clearance at Target.&nbsp;In spite of the&nbsp;negativity (or maybe as a result of my lowered expectations)&nbsp;the set actually surprised me.<b> </b></p>

<p><meta charset=""utf-8"" /></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Unlike Baze and Chirrut, my first two buildable figures,&nbsp;Jyn features a gearbox, and as a result contains more features than the other two, which&nbsp;are basically normal action figures. In addition to making the build more interesting, this means she comes with two bonus weapons to use with the gear function: technic-built tonfas. Unfortunately they are built to spin freely, so they always flop downwards, but when in use, spin they do! There&rsquo;s even a place to store them on her back, upping playability.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">And of course, her primary weapon, a gun. I&rsquo;m not sure what kind of gun really. To me it looks like a sniper, but Brickset calls it a rifle. Either way it looks gorgeous, and contains blue bolts (my favorite color!).</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Can&rsquo;t go on without talking about her torso either. She is the first set to use a new female torso shell. While it does the job of looking feminine, it makes the torso feel a bit small compared to the rest of her. The&nbsp;smaller shell means she has smaller shoulders as well. Haven&rsquo;t quite figured out whether I like it or not, but it does give her a unique silhouette.</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The only thing I can really say negatively about this set are the legs.They look&nbsp;a bit freakishly long, which I think is the fault of the thinner torso since the legs and torso are the same length as on other figures.&nbsp;Giant legs and a small, feminine torso reminded my sister characters from&nbsp;the manga &ldquo;One Piece&rdquo;, which is pretty accurate. The set is taller than her movie counterpart. Jyn, a 5&#39;3&quot; character, is as tall as Baze&nbsp;in set form, a 5&#39;11&quot; character. I find myself forgiving this since the set pulls off it&#39;s look pretty well.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Beyond that, I&rsquo;d say she is the best of the Star Wars Buildable figures I have so far. Overall fantastic and unique appearance, well designed gun, a gear function, and two additional weapons. I&rsquo;m really not sure why this set isn&#39;t well liked in the community, but then again it&#39;s only my third buildable figure, so maybe there&#39;s a lot I&#39;m missing that other sets have already done. But as my third Star Wars Figure, 75119 Jyn Erso is fantastic.</p>

The prices in my opinion are a bit on the high side for sets of this sort, but that probably stems from the fact that these figures are licensed and require additional costs to cover that licensing. Be that as it may, I&rsquo;m still picking some of these up for certain characters which interest me and on sale to avoid spending too much on sets that do not fit in fully with the Star Wars LEGO collection I currently own.</span></span></span></span></p>

Jyn&rsquo;s box uses a very nice shot of the set in fully built mode on the front with some effects to make it appear as if it is raining. The back shows different features of the character and additional sets which can be purchased in the line. All-in-all a passable box design, quite functional and designed well enough.</span></span></span></span></p>

They also include some cross-promotional imagery of regular LEGO sets and a nice shot of the other buildable figures in Jyn&rsquo;s wave, with a very impressive action shot on the inside back-cover of Jyn and K-2SO.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The build</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

You get to build quite differently as you are building a fully articulated action figure style kit, these figures also include geared action features using Technic parts to simulate some sort of action feature. (It varies by model.)</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Jyn&rsquo;s build is relatively short and easy to follow, with little to trip up experienced or novice builders joining the Constraction style play pattern. All of the parts snap together quite nicely and there isn&rsquo;t really anything of note to mention. It&rsquo;s similar to building a LEGO Mech, only without the bricks and using snap-on ball joint elements for all of the parts. I honestly enjoy these builds because it is such a different approach and you get to see the figure come about as you build it making for a satisfying construction project. It&rsquo;s kind of like model kits, but without the hassle of taking the parts off of plastic trees and then misplacing the little pieces you need to finish up the kit.</span></span></span></span></p>

Her head is a uniquely sculpted piece featuring her hat with goggles on the top. She&rsquo;s very nicely proportioned for a buildable figure and features a pair of tonfa weapons as well as a large buildable blaster with real-firing missiles.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Her geared gimmick allows you to move both arms up and down, this feature is meant more for the tonfa-like weapons as she can swing her arms up and down and attack Imperial enemies. It&rsquo;s a very nice looking figure, I appreciate all of the nice detailing and the feminine style in Constraction form has come a long way since the earlier days. There is a lot of good use of joints as well allowing Jyn to strike very dynamic poses, which balance quite well due the use of the constraction ball and socket skeleton pieces for great effect.</span></span></span></span></p>

While the skeletons are mostly the same, the use of armor pieces to differentiate them and uniquely sculpted heads makes for some great likenesses. I would recommend this set if you&rsquo;re interested in these types of figures, buildable model kit like sets that are very better than actual model kits. Still I&rsquo;d recommend getting figures like this when on sale or part of buy one get one deals so you don&rsquo;t have to over pay for what you&rsquo;re getting here.</span></span></span></span></p>
