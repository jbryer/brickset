"TK_1308","2016-10-01T13:50:47.187Z","""The Captain says you are a friend. I will not kill you.""","<p>Lego releases the first wave of constraction figures from Rogue One, starting with Cassian Andor&#39;s enforcer droid, K-2SO.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard mid range constraction figure box nicely style in black. Full shot on the front, a nice upper body close up on the left side, the standard head shot on the top and the back has the blue tinted tech spec style details showing the play features.&nbsp;<br />
Price per piece ratio is as expected.<br />
There is one instruction book and a sticker sheet.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A good number of parts in the kit and several new ones for my own collection. Those that may have collected other buildable figures from other ranges in the past may find nothing new but a lot of potential in the pieces for MOCs.&nbsp;<br />
There are 4 bags in the box. One contains the head and the other three contain the rest of the kit. They are not numbered.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 10 minutes.<br />
Unlike most of the constraction figures, this one takes a leaf from the Vader build and has a more complex design for the torso. There are some interesting play features included within the upper torso and good use of hinges and ball joints add to the look of the droid.<br />
The redesign of the hip area is nicely done and adds to the droid&#39;s height.<br />
Nothing particularly complex but still very nicely done and with a good level of detailing and more parts than on other figures.<br />
There are 2 stickers which are applied to the centre and left chest plates.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>K-2S0 stands an impressive 29 cm tall and looks great with the black colour scheme, highlighted with grey and silver components. The head is a very interesting design, looking something like a cross between a BX series Commando Droid and the forerunner of the EV series supervisor droids.<br />
There is a small grey plate on the back which activates the play features. By putting your thumb on it and moving it side to side, the droids arms swing backwards and forwards in an alternating fashion, making it look like the droid is punching an&nbsp;enemy. By pushing the plate inwards, both fists converge in front with a double punch action.<br />
As an enforcer droid, K-2SO does not need a weapon, but could be armed with anything from other figures if desired.<br />
The painted detailing of Imperial insignia on the shoulders is nicely worn and the battle damage marks to the head are also a nice touch.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The buildable action figure range was made for droids and I&#39;m surprised it&#39;s taken Lego this long to create one. As a cyborg, General Grievous doesn&#39;t count on that score but the potential of B1 and B2 series battle droids is huge.<br />
A fantastic figure, a great display piece and good fun for kids and adults alike. This is probably the best of the range made since the impressive Grievous from 2015 and worth adding to your collection.</p>

To that end the parts used and the build itself is slightly different from the standard Constraction Skeleton, as far as the arms are concerned&hellip; But let&rsquo;s go further into that during the build portion of the review. This is arguably one of my favorite new characters, and I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m not alone in that regard, so it&rsquo;s nice to get him in any fashion.</span></span></span></span></p>

Since I bought both of them at discount I forget if they were both 30$ CND initially or not. The images on the front and back are in keeping with the design showing some great action and of course some fun display pieces. These boxes, I should note, do not include the corner artwork seen on all the other regular LEGO Star Wars boxes, which is an interesting thing to note.</span></span></span></span></p>

This is a relatively simple manual to follow along with and the same promo images will be found in the back of the book.</span></span></span></span></p>

And his build is very similar when it comes to the legs, though he is quite a bit more long-legged compared to his human companion. His arms feature a thinner design and LEGO captured that with this figure by relying on the Technic Tubing part. It makes him rather long and gangly looking, but this build was super fun, I especially enjoy the detail of the antenna which uses the LEGO Minifigure Epee or Rapier sword piece in black. A highly sought after part I&rsquo;m sure for most MOC fans.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The torso and head sculpt are loaded with personality and great detailing. I&rsquo;m particularly enamored of the scuffs and scratch marks on his head. It should be noted that the detailing on the torso relies on stickers, small stickers, but stickers none-the-less.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The constraction figure</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">As noted above K-2SO is much taller than his human ally, he stands almost ten inches tall give or take and has long gangly limbs that can be posed in numerous poses to achieve some interesting action displays. His play feature isn&rsquo;t as decent as Jyn&rsquo;s, the gimmick is meant to let you push on his back and create arm swinging action as if he&rsquo;s punching out Imperial Troopers. Unfortunately the design of the gimmick in the back doesn&rsquo;t allow for a lot of room for the arms to actually move, it isn&rsquo;t geared, it&rsquo;s just a push down on two parts and release to let his arms return to their original position.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">His legs are angled using some interesting building techniques, this does limit some of the poses you can get him to take for stable footing, but not by much and he is a droid, they typically don&rsquo;t require truly dynamic poses for attacking enemies. I&rsquo;m actually surprised LEGO hasn&rsquo;t given us a Battle Droid in this style yet.</span></span></span></span></p>

In fact it might be a better alternative compared to the more expensive set featuring him. I&rsquo;d still recommend that you get this during a sale, as the asking price at full retail is a bit high for the number of parts in the set due to the Star Wars tax, as the saying goes.</span></span></span></span></p>
