<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard mid range constraction figure box nicely style in black. Full shot on the front, a nice upper body close up on the left side, the standard head shot on the top and the back has the blue tinted tech spec style details showing the play features.&nbsp;<br />
Price per piece ratio is as expected.<br />
There is one instruction book.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A good number of parts in the kit and several new ones for my own collection. Those that may have collected other buildable figures from other ranges in the past may find nothing new but a lot of potential in the pieces for MOCs.&nbsp;<br />
There are 4 bags in the box. One contains the head and the other three contain the rest of the kit. They are not numbered.<br />
All the pieces are printed so there are no stickers, which will no double delight some collectors.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 10 minutes.<br />
Like most constraction figures, this has the standard torso, leg and arm build with nothing out of the ordinary in the basic skeletal design. The use of grey pieces in the joints and limbs do stand out which is a shame, but presumably these are not available in black. That said, you can ignore that minor quibble when you see finished model.<br />
Where the Death Trooper shines is the level of detail and plating applied to the trooper to make it look as armoured as possible. The front torso plate is superbly detailed in grey and silver.<br />
The shoulder pauldron is one large flexible plastic printed piece which is held securely under the left shoulder and neck joints.<br />
He comes armed with 2 weapons, a rifle with a spring loaded launcher and a small pistol.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is a very impressive trooper and hopefully the first in a long line of Imperial soldiers to be added to the buildable figures line. He stands at 26 cm tall, which is a little disappointing as, while a good height, Death Troopers should stand as tall as K-2SO in this form.<br />
The helmet is beautifully detailed and the green lenses and breather vents as a touch of colour to the shiny black and grey. The rangefinder on the left is nicely done.<br />
The pauldron is a unique piece and the three pouches from the left side are built with bricks and secured through the plastic itself. This is nicely done but when assembled they do have a tendency to flap about. I used a tiny piece of blue tack just to hold them in place. The pouches on my armour certainly don&#39;t move that much.<br />
The large rifle doesn&#39;t really conform to any Star Wars weapon design but that&#39;s because the Death Troopers used specialised rifles similar to the BlasTech DLT-19 but not identical.&nbsp;Lego have given us a good, solid weapon with a spring loaded shooter built in. It fires a clear red projectile and there are 2 included. The spare can be clipped to the side if desire but this does look very odd. The extended stock on the rear is a nice touch.<br />
The smaller pistol is very similar to the BlasTech SE-14C and not a bad likeness at all. This can clip into the hole at the top of either thigh plate.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>An excellent figure and a must have for any collection. It displays well on it&#39;s own and looks even more impressive in a squad. Solid and playable for kids and a nice piece for adult collectors, the Death Trooper is one of the best in the range to date.</p>
