<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong><br />
The box is the size you&#39;d expect with a set in this price range. This set includes a whopping 5 instruction booklets! In book 1 you build all the components&nbsp;of the fortress. Book 2-5 focus on putting together all the different&nbsp;models this set has to offer. More about that later in this review.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong><br />
This set contains 6 numbered bags and 1 bag with some plates. There are some nice&nbsp;printed banner pieces with a creeper design&nbsp;on them. This set also includes a un-printed&nbsp;Steve head piece for the armor stand.&nbsp;Besides that the new horse head piece there are no other special pieces in this set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
This set contains 4 minifigures and 2 brick build animals. Steve wears a full golden armor which is exclusive to this set. The mobs in this set are 3 skeletons, all equipped with a bow. One skeleton gets an iron helmet piece and one skeleton gets an iron body armor piece.&nbsp;The included animals are a&nbsp;sheep and a horse. The horse is a really cool animal which Steve can ride. But first he needs to tame it...how do you tame a horse in Lego&nbsp;Minecraft??</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong><br />
The build is very easy and straightforward,&nbsp;it is kind of boring and repetitive too. There are many large plates and a lot of 2x2, 2x4 and&nbsp;2x6&nbsp;bricks. You can put this set together in under one hour&nbsp;easily. That is such a shame for a set of this price range. There are no challenging building techniques and the &#39;hardest&#39; part of the build was the opening mechanism for the front doors.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong><br />
There are instructions for 4 different&nbsp;variations of this set. The one displayed on the front of the box is the best one in my opinion. It is very easy to reconfigure your set because&nbsp;it are all separate builds. You can also very easily make your own variations outside of the ones where the instructions are provided for.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong><br />
So here we are, answering the title question; How strong are the walls of this Fortress? As you know, a wall has two sides and this is no exception. Let&#39;s start with the bad side of the wall. This set is very under whelming in its build and in its stability. Once you&#39;ve put together a configuration of this set you like there is no way to pick it up and moving it without taking it apart. Some parts of this set are very easy to knock off in play as they have a weak connection with a 2x2 jumper plate.</p>

<p>On to the good side: This is one of the better playsets of the line. In just a few minutes you can change the appearance of the fortress completely. The doors on the front can be opened with a nice mechanism and there is a iron door which can be opened with a level like part. All 5 variations of the sword are included to arm Steve for battle. There is space for two&nbsp;animals in the stalls and they all got a nice door to access&nbsp;them. The fortress in completely lit by 8 torches and 3 nether rack fires, just like you would in the game to scare off any mobs for the night. There is a small farm inside with a pool of water. You also get 4 plant pots, some flowers and one tree with a apple hanging form in which you can pick to fill Steve&#39;s tummy. Yu can also fire two flick fire missiles&nbsp;from the wall which I guess are meant to replicate dispensers to fend off any mobs in range.</p>

<p>Final verdict: Very under whelming&nbsp;build, excellent playset! Overall 3 out of 5 points for this set.</p>
