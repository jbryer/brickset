"Walter_Bruges","2016-09-14T04:42:07.44Z","Keep the light burning bright","<p>I&#39;m a parent of a two-year-old who is a bit too young for the sets I&#39;m building, so I have to admit they&#39;re for me right now. I&#39;m just getting back into Lego and falling hard for it.</p>

<p>This is an excellent set in my opinion.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>First thing that blew me away was the size of the instruction booklet. It&#39;s like a small magazine or catalogue. Actually, that&#39;s not true, the first thing was the image on the box... This was an impulse buy because it was 20% off the RRP and I was taken by the red and white lighthouse snuggled up to a little cottage. Cute and cosy and somehow nostalgic for me (no, I&#39;ve never been a lighthouse keeper but I think the idea of work-home-remoteness has some kind of romantic connection for me). I did think &#39;cute&#39; and I wasn&#39;t that keen on the orca based on the box image, but got it anyway and I&#39;m so happy I did.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Plenty of parts in the set and I soon realised that I left it late in the evening to start this one. Nothing really stands out too much except the colour of the little dudes pants were interesting to me - a very earthy green. There are some special pieces here and there, like the light brick and the pieces for the lighthouse build, but most of them are pretty conventional pieces used in interesting ways. I really like the little sailboat picture (printed, not a pesky sticker) that goes inside the house.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Cute couple. The female fig is &#39;child&#39; size with the shortened legs. Not sure if this is supposed to be a father/daughter combo, but I think she is supposed to be petite (I&#39;m thinking that because my wife is petite, so maybe that&#39;s just me). she has cute freckles and the hair is a good match. The guy has a hat and I like the pants as I mentioned before. Printing on the torsos is all good but no second faces on the heads (might have expected it on the female). I do wish figures with hats, helmets, caps came with hair too, so you could interchange. Would be nice sometimes to have that option.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s the biggest set I&#39;ve built so far. Although the Temple of Airjitzu is on its way and I&#39;ll make sure I start that one in the morning. Well, the first thing you build is the orca and it is quite a neat little build with a good amount of pieces put together in a complicated way to produce this decent sized model. So I said I wasn&#39;t particularly interested in it from the cover (the generic cartoon eyes maybe) but in the flesh it is very cool. I love the pink tongue and it just looks great as a stylised rendering of an orca. I&#39;ll quickly say the seagulls are also surprisingly cool for such simple little builds and look great placed on the finished lighthouse. On the cover they are &#39;flying&#39; and don&#39;t look as good. The house is a cool build too. Pretty logical, so nothing to report, except to note that I like the colour palette. The Lighthouse is simple and, of course, repetitive to get the tower built, but the light brick addition and how it works gets your attention back into it toward the end.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This looks fantastic. It&#39;s a decent size without taking up too much space. The colours work very nicely together. It is a 3-in-1 Creator so there are two other builds: a house/cottage with boat and a small lighthouse with a ferry/houseboat. I&#39;ll probably just stick with the lighthouse... BUT... in the booklet they show three (maybe four. I don&#39;t have it in front of me) different configurations of the house and lighthouse, including one where you have two dwellings and a lighthouse. So this is kinda like a 7-in-1 set and I was pretty blown away by that. It also looks great in either opened (as on the box) or closed positions and you can separate the lighthouse off completely from the little house to spread out the &#39;scene&#39; if you wish.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Right now it is a model sitting in my studio but once my wee girl is old enough the lighthouse will be a site of adventure and intrigue (think Famous Five) or maybe just some extraordinary little &#39;dollhouse&#39; with a lighthouse at its side. Who knows. For me it has a feeling of escapism and, ironically enough, a sense of peacefulness... damn, I need to live in a lighthouse.</p>

"lentil","2017-01-06T18:07:12.917Z","Beautiful and Fun","<p>This is one of my favorite two Creator sets of 2016 (the other one being #31052 Vacation Getaways). It looks super on display, has some neat parts and building techniques, and is really fun to play with too! I have only done the main build as yet.</p>

<h3>Pieces</h3>

<p>Obviously to make the lighthouse, you get lots of cool macaroni bricks in red and white (24 of each color!). Also useful various cylinder and 1/4 cylinder plates, black curved railing pieces, two half cylinder trans elements for the light, and the lightbrick itself. There are also a few fun shaped (slanted/curved/tiled) pieces used to build the orca, as well as blue plates in slanted and cylinder shapes for the watery base. The medium blue and dark gray bricks used to build the house are certainly nice too, as are the sloped bricks in black, gray, tan, and dark tan which make up the roof and the rockwork. And then there are some ball-joint connecting pieces as well. Really not a dud piece in the lot!</p>

<h3>The Instructions</h3>

<p>As with other recent Creator models, the instructions are bound into one large booklet (bound, not stapled). This makes for a nice presentation and feels very substantial, but it is a bit annoying to me that although the pages are numbered, there is no table of contents. There are of course three different models to build in a 3-in-1 like this, but if you wanted to do e.g. build #2, you&#39;d be stuck flipping randomly through the booklet trying to find where it starts. The bound booklet also does not lay flat as well as the smaller stapled versions.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>Bags are not numbered (of course, since they don&#39;t know which build you want to do first), but there are not too many pieces. I did some minimal sorting but it was not too bad. It is a fun build, especially the orca.</p>

<p>The building has a surprising modular construction. It consists of six separate sections which you build separately, then snap together using technic pins: the house (hinged), lighthouse, front pier/porch, front &quot;yard&quot;, and two side pieces with rocks. You can assemble the modules in various configurations to create different looks - the assemblage on the cover is just a suggestion (although it is a very nice looking one).</p>

<p>The lighthouse also consists of four separate subsections (+ the base) which are attached using studded tiles, and one of the roof sections also detaches easily. You can rearrange these in many different ways too, putting e.g. all or part of the lighthouse on the roof, or rearranging the lighthouse sections. This really adds some fun elements to this model.</p>

<h3>The Finished Model</h3>

<p>I think this set is just downright adorable! The orca is beyond cute - perhaps among the best brick-built animals I have seen. His lower jaw is hinged on a ball joint, so it can be manipulated all around to give him a really goofy lollygagging expression. His pink tongue is just precious. His tail is also jointed in two places, and his flippers are also on ball joints. He has a lovely overall shape and it&#39;s really fun to pose him.</p>

<p>The house is small, but has a bright, attractive color scheme and cozy design. I really like the inclusion of a few random dark tan bricks here and there on the lighthouse - somehow adds just that perfect touch of ramshackle realism. The tile printed with a ship painting looks charming hanging on the living room wall.</p>

<p>The rockwork is also very well done, especially the little trans clear cheese plates used to represent water droplets - they really make the set sparkle.</p>

<p>I was also tickled by the two little seagulls - they are very expressive and seem to be squawking loudly, despite being constructed from only 6 little pieces.</p>

<p>The lighthouse makes use of a lightbrick, of course, but there is also a clever &quot;lantern&quot; hanging from the ceiling of the globe which consists of several trans clear and yellow bricks. The lantern floods with light very effectively when the lightbrick is pressed. The lever mechanism for pressing the lightbrick is also interesting.</p>

<p>Overall this set is designed very artistically, with a kind of Japanese minimalism and attention to detail. Every brick seems to be happy in its place.</p>

<p>The only thing I perhaps am not entirely satisfied with is the technic connections. Because the modular sections snap together with technic pins, the sections attach somewhat loosely and jiggle. They are not in any danger of falling off, of course, but the jiggly technic connectors just lack that satisfying &quot;snap&quot; of tight lego stud connections. When you pick the model up its various parts wiggle all around and make an irritating noise. This probably means I need to see some sort of doctor... but I somehow find this bothersome :-)</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>Despite being pretty small and not having many traditional &quot;playable&quot; features, this set has great playability power! First, there&#39;s the fact that you can arrange and rearrange all those modular parts into many different configurations. Second, the orca is really fun to pose and play with. There is a bucket of silver fish that the little girl or her dad can feed to the orca, and he can actually catch them with his mouth. Third, it is always fun to press the lever and light the lighthouse lamp! Finally, the interior of the lighthouse is not accessible via doors and windows, but since it consists of four little subsections that can be easily snapped on and off, this creates lots of secret places to hide stuff! Perhaps smugglers are hiding contraband goods there? Forgotten pirate treasure? Or a runaway orphan, or robbers, are secretly bunking inside? (A minifigure will fit into each compartment, if seated/curled up.) This set really has lots of great possibilities due to its inventive construction.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This set is a bit pricier per piece compared to other Creator sets, but I think it&#39;s totally worth it considering the nice range of valuable pieces you get, plus the beautiful design.</p>

<h3>Alternate Builds</h3>

<p>The Quick Build is a little houseboat with a separate lighted buoy. I have not done this one yet, but from the pictures it looks like a legitimately interesting alternate use of some of the bricks. The houseboat looks really cute, and it&#39;s a great idea to use the lighthouse pieces to make a buoy.</p>

<p>The Medium Build is a smaller house with some of the lighthouse bricks used to make a raised pier. There is also a little white speedboat. The lightbrick is used as a porchlight in this one. This one looks less appealing to me - more or less a scaled down version of the main build, but without the lighthouse. Both alternate builds are attractive in their own right though.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>An excellent Creator set that is a winner on multiple levels: display value, playability, comoponents, and creativity of design. I hope we continue to see Creator sets on this level in the coming years!</p>
