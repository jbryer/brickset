"The_Brick_Guy_87","2016-12-18T20:07:53.37Z","The best LEGO camper yet.","<p>I got this&nbsp;set when me and my parents visited the mall that that dad had involvement in its building (he is an engineer). I am very happy to have it in my collection. Read to know why. This review will cover the main model.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are 792 pieces, mostly in white. Two extra parts, that don&#39;t seem to belong to the main model: 2 grey technic parts. Some rare parts are the brown 1x2 plates that connect the bear&#39;s legs with the body, the printed map and the yellow 1x4 inverted thingies&nbsp;at the underside of the boat. Great selection of parts overall.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>It takes about 2 and a half hours. The front windshield section of the camper is build interestingly with the parts upside down. The build is sometimes a bit repetitive but enjoyable nonetheless.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>We get 2 of them: a mother and a child. The mother has a brown ponytail, the common female expression with the smile, green torso with necklace which was seen&nbsp;in the 2015 City Dune Buggy transport set and dark blue legs. The boy has a dark blue cap, the common child face with the smile and freckles, the 2015 City undersea exploration and tan child legs. Not bad minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>The camper is awesome! It is a very&nbsp;well built American-styled RV with enough room for two minifigs to sit next to each other properly. The interior is quite detailed with the mini kitchen, toilet, table and bed. Speaking of the bed, you can pull it from the outside, so there can be enough area for a minifig&nbsp;to pass from the back to the front. The back area can be split into two, which is neat. The yellow shelter is a neat feature and there is a ladder on the back.</p>

<p>The boat is simple in design and the green looks odd on the floor but it is effective nonetheless and adds playability. Accessories include a table, two chairs, barbecue grill. The bear is good, although the grey parts that connect the head with the body stand out a bit too much in my opinion. Brown or dark brown would have worked better.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This is an excellent Creator set. It features good parts and offers great playability and is good as a display model as well. I recommend it to all ages and it will be perfect for a Breaking Bad moc. If you find this review unhelpful, please contact me to give me some advice to make better reviews. Goodbye for now!</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<ul>
	<li>Absolutely charming main build from start to finish</li>
	<li>Astounding variety of pieces, no more than 12 of any particular piece (impressive considering the amount of white pieces in a set that has almost 800 total pieces)</li>
	<li>Efficient use of spaces and small details, including the table, chairs and grill</li>
	<li>Delightful and silly bear that is unable to ever eat that fish</li>
	<li>Cloth awning is soft and is integrated perfectly into the set</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
	<li>Merely adequate mini-figures, nothing too special</li>
	<li>Upper level, front section of the RV seems a little unfinished, especially compared to the back</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Secondary Builds</strong></p>

<p>Pros</p>

<ul>
	<li>Both builds are completely different than the primary RV</li>
	<li>Variety of pieces allows for unique details in each of the smaller builds</li>
	<li>No colorful blemishes that usually&nbsp;hinder the secondary builds of these Creator sets</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons</p>

<ul>
	<li>Can&#39;t avoid using green plates for the interiors of builds like the yacht</li>
	<li>Mini-figures&nbsp;are stuck in the same configuration for each build</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is an excellent set all the way around. &nbsp;Price per part ratio is solid, but as the set is often found at a discount online, it is usually even better. &nbsp;Each build has a unique but detailed design, and has been mentioned before, each could be a primary build for a set. &nbsp;I was blown away by the huge variety of smaller pieces that are inspiring in my own building. &nbsp;By far my favorite set of 2016 and thankfully not one which breaks the bank!</p>
