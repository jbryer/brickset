Great looking and awesome play features!","<p>The Summer 2016 Creator sets have been almost totally eclipsed by the truly excellent Vacation Getaways set, and I have to admit, when I first saw pictures of 31053 Treehouse Adventures, I was not impressed at all. &nbsp;Already owning 31010 Treehouse from 2013, this set did not seem like an improvement at all. &nbsp;Needless to say, after buying it and putting it together, I love it and think its far superior to the 2013 Treehouse!</p>

<p>The set comes in a standard thin cardboard box that does its best to showcase the features and alternate builds. &nbsp;Inside are a few non-numbered bags and three sets of instructions (one for each build) in a bag with no cardboard backing. &nbsp;There are no stickers in this set.</p>

<p>Parts wise, there is a nice variety of parts and colors but not enough of anything to make it a good parts pack for any particular project. &nbsp;There are a decent number of brown half arches/tree branches along with a couple other unique parts, only two small white windows, two brown fence sections, the printed map and cookie and a frog. &nbsp;The only slightly rarer colors in the set are small quantities of dark green and dark reddish-brown.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set comes with two minifigures, both kids with short legs. &nbsp;A boy and a girl, both with dark brown hair and freckles. &nbsp;The torsos are common ones but with appropriate and nicely done prints. &nbsp;The minifigs come with a hammer, a paint roller, orange hat, cookie, map and a brick built squirt gun. &nbsp;There is also a brick built cart for the kids to carry their stuff around in.</p>

<p>The build was delightful. &nbsp;There are tons of extra details and hidden features that the box just cant do justice. &nbsp;There are plenty of SNOT techniques and I liked the use of ball joints to give flexible, natural looking leaves to accent the structure. &nbsp;The mechanism for dropping and raising the bridge/ladder works flawless and is very well done. &nbsp;The set looks very natural and level of detail is impressive. &nbsp;I also like that the play features in no way detract from the look and feel of the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model looks great and is wonderful to play with. &nbsp;The set looks solid from all angles and is hinged in the middle to allow it to be posed on a long front with the bridge up connecting the two trees, or it can be hinged closed for a more compact design with the bridge down as a ladder and the set looking more like a single big tree. &nbsp;While both ways look great from most angles, I think it looks best opened up with the bridge up, but in this position the back is the weakest looking side. &nbsp;When closed up, the ladder is not great looking, but the set looks better from all angles.</p>

<p>One thing that is hard to truly visualize until you build the set is how smooth the bridge feature works. &nbsp;There is an angled technic arm hidden under one platform and on the other platform there is a very natural looking branch sticking out the back. &nbsp;When you hinge the set closed, the branch activates the technic arm to lower the bridge. &nbsp;When you open it back up, the action of the branch moving back out resets the arm and automatically raises the bridge. &nbsp;It works perfectly every time, is very smooth, looks great and its nice that it does both the raising and lowering completely automatically. &nbsp;There is also a hidden compartment in one of the tree trunks that you can store some of the accessories. &nbsp;There are a number of other fun details, a well built yellow lawn chair, a nice brick built telescope, a yellow flag, brick built blue jay, small water fall covering the base hinge, two lanterns, a desk and a ladder leading from the main platform up to the roof were the telescope is.</p>

<p>A rope is also included that the kids can use to lift up supplies or the one tan (unpainted) board. &nbsp;The board matches the size of the painted boards on the main room, so the idea is the kids can lift the unpainted board up, use the paint can and paint roller (which matches the paint color) to paint the board, then the included hammer can be used to attach it to the treehouse.</p>

<p>I absolutely love this set, it looks great, works great and my daughter has played with it for hours, all for a fairly low price of only $34.99. &nbsp;I would highly recommend this set!</p>

"ab21","2017-02-24T23:11:18.493Z","Alternative models that seem to be meant as inspirations","<p>When my dark ages ended, I sometimes longed for the time when boxes had pictures of alternative models on the back. Sometime later, I read that Lego decided that &quot;officially&quot; depicted alternative models should be subject to the same standards as the main models, and from there it was only a short step to including their instructions as well...and born was the creator line.</p>

<p>In several of brickset&#39;s&nbsp;official creator set reviews I saw request for pictures of alternative models with the leftover bricks, so I set out to provide just that here.</p>

<h3>The main model</h3>

<p>I was not terribly impressed by the images (neither on the web nor on the box), especially the slanted from of the house, but I liked the both the (119-step) build and the result more than I expected and find the play features quite impressive.</p>

<p>As I write this, there is a user review &nbsp;by thoughtsonblocks focusing on this model and an official review by MeganL with whose assessment I agree mostly.</p>

<h3>The second model</h3>

<p>The second model is a house next to a tree-like structure, as opposed to a house on a tree-like structure (the third) and ... a house and a platform each on one tree-like structure (the main model). The upper deck, which includes a leisure facility (a sun bed) and something ladder-like to reach a small platform higher up the tree, is easily detachable to reach the interior of the house, which includes a table and is decorated with a&nbsp;map on the wall.</p>

<p>The model is build in 85 steps and seems to use only about 70% of the parts. The remainder is sufficient to expand the tree and the surrounding &quot;landscape&quot; (&quot;grass&quot; with some colored spots and a small river in front of it) a bit, or to build another tree trunk with an area to stand on on top (pictured).</p>

<h3>The third model</h3>

<p>The third model is even smaller than the second (although taller) and completed in 76 steps. There are even more parts unused, enough to build another structure not much smaller than the actual model (the larger parts are enough for a &quot;landscape&quot; with about the same footprint).&nbsp;This time, however,&nbsp;there are not enough green pieces left to build the leafy part of anything resembling a tree.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am not quite sure what it is that I build here, but I quite like it. Maybe I could put the official tree house on top of my structure and expand the landscape at the base?</p>

<h3>Overall thoughts</h3>

<p>While there are creator sets that offer a medieval temple, a snowy mountain scene and a submarine all build from the same parts (I exaggerate), this one offers a tree house, a tree house and a tree house. To me it feels like the latter two are meant more to serve as inspiration for one&#39;s own variant of a (you guessed it) tree house rather than to impress as models in their own right. I do not mean this as a bad thing, and&nbsp;they do quite well -- there aren&#39;t many different ways to build a latter here, but the attachment mechanism is different for all three sets, so is the manner in which the &quot;leaves&quot; are build, one model has a rather slim tree with a house on the side, one has a thick tree trunk with a small comparment in it...and so on. If you want to build something other than a tree house, you&#39;re on your own (which is not a bad thing...but wait, doesn&#39;t the second model, seen from the back, look a bit like the face of an owl...?)</p>

<p>I put this set on a wishlist&nbsp;because I thought the part selection would easily allow to build MOCs that integrate with my daugther&#39;s&nbsp;Elves sets, and while I did not yet get around to build any, I still think so. For a house in a natural scene, some actual tree leaves elements would have been nice, and possibly these larger flower stems -- that the green parts of the trees do not look very tree-like is probably the thing that bothers me most about this set (but not that much overall).</p>
