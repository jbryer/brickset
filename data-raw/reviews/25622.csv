<p>This set has some cool parts, like 2 telephone hands or 2 prison doors and&nbsp;few slick plates 6x1.</p>

<h2>Surprises, moving stuff</h2>

<p>There is a cool main gate that can slide down, triggered by part of the roof. Right and left prison cells (floors) can move. And 2 more I will not elaborate as one should see by themselves. Very playable.</p>

<h2>5 minifigs</h2>

<p>Should I tell more? Just the minifigs are worth the price alone, and one gets extra bricks ;-)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I highly recommend!</p>

<p>we get;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kai - the red Ninja on a rescue/jailbreak mission. He is the newer print and comes with the new one shoulder pauldron.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prison stripes Zane - the Titanium Ninja in jail. A delightful fig.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Giant Stone Warrior - in prison stripes. This is the first member of the Stone Army that the ninjas face. Originally awoken in the History Museum. Now in prison&nbsp;and a reluctant ally. He is glorious in his 4 armed white and grey form.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prison stripes Captain Soto - Ugh! We finally get a Captain Soto fig. First Captain of the Destiny&#39;s Bounty from back when it was a pirate ship, and it&#39;s the prison uniform instead of his normal pirate gear. Oh well he&#39;s still great to have. ( you can actually make a full TV Captain Soto by combining parts of this fig with the torso and parts from the CMF Pirate Captain figure)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jail Guard - more civilians are always good. He seems a friendly sort.</p>

<p>The Build and Main Model is acceptable. A nice little scene with a cell, a visiting room, a dropping gate and a launching table with bread. It forms a nice backdrop, and it&#39;s elements can be used to flesh out a larger Ninjago&nbsp;display. It also works well with any Super Heroes&nbsp;set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall it&#39;s a nice set at a great price. The minifigs are pretty much unique. Lots of play value and collectability.</p>

<p>The Minifigures included are:</p>

<p>Skybound Kai, a common but still nice to get</p>

<p>Prison outfit Zane, a nice overall figure</p>

<p>Prison giant stone warrior, a great 4-armed figure</p>

<p>Prison Soto, would have liked to get regular Soto, but this is good enough</p>

<p>Prison guard, a civilian most don&#39;t really care about but is still a nice figure</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set was disappointing to most people as they wanted a bigger, better kryptarium prison to display, but I think this is a good playset as it has lots of minifigures and play features e.g. a door that can be broken open, a toilet that can be used to escape, a bread launching table and an exit gate/ cage for giant stone warrior</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall would recommend this to kids and collectors who don&#39;t mind that it is more of a playset than a display piece, good minifigure pack and nice playset</p>
