"Faefrost","2017-01-03T21:01:37.067Z","A great set only flawed by some strange fig choices","<p>This is one of the better Ninjago Mech sets. The Salvage Mech is bold, distinctive and different. To my eye it ranks up there with the all time classic original Samurai X mech. The only mildly disappointing element of this set is&nbsp;the figure selection. Not so much for who they included, as for the missed opportunities and for who they did not.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions -&nbsp;</strong>The box theme and trim matches all of the other Day of teh Dead sets. Largely unchanged since Air Pirates save for the storyline identifying logo in the lower left. In this case the Lantern. The main art is a nice bold energetic picture showing the Salvage Mech in Combat with Frackjaw&#39;s smaller Skeleton Battlesuit against a dessert badlands backdrop. It does the job well and catches the eye. Instructions are the normal folded stapled and mutilated booklets stuffed haphazardly in the box, along with some interesting detailing stickers. The stickers do add quite a bit to the character of the set so I would consider using them.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs -&nbsp;</strong>The minifigs are both the sets strength and it&#39;s biggest disappointment. We get four rather nice figs. Krazi, Frakjaw&nbsp;Nya and Ronin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nya - Comes in her more solidly burgundy ninja garb, not the Samurai X suit nor the blue and red version we have seen. Her markings are similar to the boys Sky Pirates torso&#39;s with her Water Emblem being the central symbol. She comes without a hood, instead having a hairpiece. She also includes the one shoulder gold pauldron/scabbard. Pictures and instructions all show her bare faced, although the set does come with an extra of Ronin&#39;s Ninja Face Scarf, which is also color appropriate for Nya. Dark Red.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ronin - The star of the set. A new version of Ronin, with all new torso and leg printing, and a hair piece instead of a hat. he also comes with a flintlock rifle and a dark red face scarf. Overall a great and distinct figure. The most unique figure in the set.</p>

<p>Krazi and Frakjaw - The two skeletons share the same printed skeleton torso, boots and arms. The y each have distinct faces with Krazi having some derranged looking mouth makeup and frakjaw having some riveted damage. krazi has a classic blue and red jesters hat. Frakjaw has a spiky shoulder&nbsp;pad and an aviator helmet with goggles. Both torso&#39;a have thinly printed loincloth&#39;s and some rivets near the shoulders. These guys have nothing we have not seen before, but it has been a long time since we have seen them. Younger or more recent Ninjago fans will be delighted to get them in a current set as aftermarket prices for wave one Ninjago sets are obscene.</p>

<p><strong>Parts -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The set is a parts bonanza. My personal favorite is the large printed &quot;Kendo Mask&quot; Canopy that the mech derives so much of its flavor from. There are also some Olive Green Cars type hoods, Some nice bright orange parts, and a ton of nice dark red. Plus it gives two more classic Ninjago spinner tops in pearl gold.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build/Model -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;First up we have Frakjaws little mech suit. I love it. It is similar to the Polybag Ninja small mechs from last year, or the more recent Nexo Knights Battlesuits. It&#39;s really a tiny little mecha. Pretty much a Mixel that a figure can pilot. Not alot of articulation as it doesn&#39;t have knees or elbows. But it is so adorable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Salvage Mech is the main build, and it is a really really nice mech. Fantastic colors both make it feel like it is made from junk parts, while still keeping it a coherent an d visually pleasing design. The legs don&#39;t have a ton of movement as the knees like many modern mechs are fixed crouched, with movement only at the hips and ankles. But they work well. The right arm has a bow with a spring shooter. The left has two stud shooters, one of which gets rigged with a rather interesting new net launcher mechanism. The net has a dish and stud attached so it can be fired from a stud shooter, rather than the classic Airplane Engine/Net Cannon design. The back of the mech, while not as nice as the front, is surprisingly robust and complete for a Lego Mech. It doesn&#39;t look or feel skeletal. This is a Great Mech</p>

<p><strong>Overview - </strong>This is a very distinct set. Everything that comes out of teh box is fantastic. And the price is about right. So good all around value. The only flaw with it comes from some confusion and a little bit of disappointment regarding the minfigure selection. While I understand that the sets often do not perfectly match up to the TV show. This one seems a bit egregious. somehow this set leaves the impression that this is a new Nya Samurai Mech&nbsp;to a casual glance. It is actually Ronin&#39;s craft. In the on screen scenes Nya does not appear (She is off fighting Master Chen with her Brother). The Ninja in this set should have been Jay. Which is honestly trivial. But more disappointing is this would have been the perfect set to finally give us two of the major supporting and recurring characters that we have never gotten in actual Lego form. The scene the set is depicting revolved around Jay&#39;s parents Ed and Edna. It just feels like a missed opportunity there. Overall I would call this set a must have for the Ninjago collector. The distinct and definitive Ronin figure and the superb mech make it so.&nbsp;</p>

"lego_collector_123","2020-06-30T07:45:33.8Z","Fantastic set!","<p>Ninjago often has great success with mechs, and this one looks awesome. It has good articulation, lots of action features and nice minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Ronin: This is the second Lego set to include Ronin. The TV show figure wears a hat on his hair. As such a Lego part doesn&rsquo;t exist he only has a hair piece which is a good compromise. I&rsquo;ve always been a fan of Ronin and I think this figure is fantastic. He has dark orange shoulder-length hair and a dark red bandanna. His face only has a single expression with a smirk and an eye piece. I also like the shoulder piece which stores his two katanas. The torso and leg print is amazing, it&rsquo;s made of sections of weathered armour plates which mimics the design of the mech. He carries two black katanas and a musket. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Nya: I&rsquo;m a little confused as to the inclusion of this version of Nya. The set is part of the &lsquo;Day of the Departed&rsquo; sub theme, but she wears her old &lsquo;Skybound&rsquo; robes. I would much prefer the inclusion of her new &lsquo;Day of the Departed&rsquo; clothes. Despite that, the figure is well detailed. She has her standard straight black hair and a smiling expression. I wish the figure had two faces. She has gold shoulder armour which holds her two katanas over one shoulder unlike Ronin who has them over different shoulders. She has black robes with dark red highlights and a blue symbol and wields two black katanas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Krazi: The &lsquo;Day of the Departed&rsquo; subtheme re introduces classic Ninjago villains, an idea that I love, and Krazi is from the original wave of Ninjago. He has a red and black jester hat which looks great and his face print is a skull with red lipstick which shows his personality. I very much like the design of the Ninjago Skulkin body, arm and leg pieces, which remain unchanged from 2011 when they were first introduced. The torso looks like a skeleton with a printed belt adorned with a skull. The arms are in an upright position&nbsp;so they can hold weapons but the hands can&rsquo;t rotate. Each &lsquo;Day of the Departed&rsquo; set contains a collectable glowing weapon and this one has an axe. I like the transparent greenish yellow colour and it has a gem in the hilt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Frakjaw: This Skulkin character is less detailed. He wears an aviator helmet and goggles which look great. He has a different face to Krazi but the same torso, arms, and legs. I love his spiky shoulder armour which doesn&rsquo;t come in many sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Sidebuild</strong></p>

<p>A small mech is included in the set for the Skulkins. The mech is driven by Frackjaw. The front of the mech is detailed with a nice skull sticker and opens forwards. Skeletal arms are used on the sides to represent the rib cage to good effect. The arms have great articulation; the shoulders are attached with ball joints that can angle in every direction and the elbows can move as well. Each hand clasps a large sword that can double as Frakjaw&rsquo;s weapons. The legs look ugly; the feet resemble the boots worn by the skeletons but the legs look incomplete and are grey not white. The legs move well however, with both the legs and feet attached with ball joints. The back is completely undetailed. While the articulation is good, this small model looks severely under detailed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Set&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I like quite a few Lego mechs and this one promises to be great. In universe the mech is built out of scrap metal, so the design and the colour scheme of dark red, olive green and orange looks good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the most important features of a mech is the articulation. The arms are attached with ball joints and the elbows use hinges. This gives the arms a great range of motion which I appreciate. The hips are on a turntable that can rotate almost 180 degrees. The legs also have good poseability; they are attached with ratcheted joints so they stay in position and can be posed well. The feet use ball joints so they can always stay flat however you position the legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quite a few nice features are built into the set. The left arm has two stud shooters that can fire either studs or a net. Extra studs, a sausage, and a gold nugget are stored in a cool looking launcher. The right arm features a crossbow. It uses a black spring-loaded shooter which looks great and has gold blades that represent the bow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The front of the body is nice. It has a printed canopy piece and several sticker details. The canopy opens forward and the driver stands in the cockpit. Two clips on the back can store Ronin&rsquo;s swords, which I love. The back is detailed with a removable glider. The gold blades from the bow can be easily removed and attached to the front of the glider as wings. The glider is a great inclusion and has space for one figure. The right leg has more stickers and a clip for Ronin&rsquo;s musket. The left leg stores a stickered skateboard which is cool.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a fantastic set. It has nice articulation, it looks amazing and it has tons of action features built into it. The minifigures are all great inclusions except perhaps this version of Nya, and the side build while not perfect still adds to the set. $70 seems fair and I definitely recommend this set.&nbsp;<br />
