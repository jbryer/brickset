"TechnicMan","2016-09-15T16:40:50.56Z","A great addition to the Ninjago dragon family!","<p>Picked this set up recently for &pound;31.99 on Amazon, nearly 25% off. I am a fan of dragons and have collected all the large Ninjago ones.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nice design as usual. Great picture on the front and back and smaller ones demonstrating the play features.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing amazing but I do like the cow skull used on the catapult and there some nice&nbsp;fluorescent green parts. Nice mix of System, Technic and constraction pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Not a minifigure fan, but they look ok to me. They have been added to my (rapidly growing) minfigure&nbsp;pile.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty straightforward. Some nice SNOT techniques on the body and head and the Technic wings are well designed.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Ninjago dragons always look better in real life than they do in the pictures and this is no exception.The head is very well designed, not quite on a par with Master Wu&#39;s Dragon 70734, but it looks great. I particularly like the way the designer used green horn pieces to give shape to the eyes.</p>

<p>The tail is also worth a mention&nbsp;as it splits into two and even has stud shooters on the ends. It&#39;s very posable too and helps to stabilise the model when its standing, although it&#39;s not really needed as the legs and feet are very stable.</p>

<p>The <em>piece de resistance</em> however are&nbsp;the wings. They are constructed mostly&nbsp;from technic axles and connectors which gives them a great skeletal look and also allows them to fold up when they&#39;re not being used for flying. The cloth wing covers are delightful, with a mottled green effect on the top side and a dazzling gold and green pattern on the underside. Beautiful!</p>

<p>I suppose I&#39;d better mention the other two parts of the model: a&nbsp;catapult and a sort of cave/watchtower thing. Neither are particularly inspiring but they do give added play value for younger builders. These have been disassembled and the parts have gone straight in my parts box.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love it! A fantastic display model. If you like dragons then buy it,&nbsp;you will not be disappointed. A great addition to the Ninjago dragon family!</p>

"Hylocera","2017-02-08T03:33:55.117Z","Another Quality Skybound Set","<p>I got this set when it came out last year, and still have it intact on my desk. As a MOCer,&nbsp;I think that right off the bat says something about the quality of this set. Apologies in advance for the dark photos.</p>

<h2><b>Box/Instructions</b></h2>

<p>The box is standard fare, although it is much wider than it is high for a set at this price point. The instructions and stickers are loose inside the box. Also inside are 4 numbered bags, and a pair of wings in their own sealed packet. Mine came a little bent, but the cloth is soft (I think it might be the same as the type used for the new capes), so there was/is no obvious damage to them.</p>

<h2><strong>Interesting Parts</strong></h2>

<p>As is typical with Skybound sets, this one comes with a whole lot of interesting, unique, and rare parts. I think this time I&#39;ll let the pictures speak for themselves. I will at least say that the tassel piece is very, very nice and, that this is the first set I&#39;ve seen with bigfig arms not on a bigfig.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/600/32621730162_623f0c4b41_n.jpg"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/732/32395070140_2798a417d4_n.jpg"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/768/32621726422_9e7bba3fed_n.jpg"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/297/32395067690_9805538c5d_n.jpg"" /></p>

<h2><strong>The Build</strong></h2>

<p>The build is split into 3 parts: the catapult, the tower and the bit of landscaping it sits on, and the dragon itself. The first 2 are fairly simple and not particularly interesting - the tower especially. It is laughably small compared to everything else in the set, including the catapult, which stands at about the same height as the tower. The dragon of course absolutely dwarfs it. Honestly I&#39;m not sure why it&#39;s even included. The Vikings theme covered similar subject matter like in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7021-1/Viking-Double-Catapault-versus-the-Armoured-Ofnir-Dragon"">7021</a>&nbsp;without any sort of structures, and did so very successfully. The longer I have this set displayed on my desk, the more superfluous the tower feels.</p>

<p>But the dragon. Let&#39;s talk about the dragon. This was easily one of the most satisfying build experiences I&#39;ve had in a while with an official set. There are all sorts of ingenious techniques and parts usages, like the beautifully detailed head and bigfig arms which I&#39;m assuming are meant to be some sort of shoulder muscle. The&nbsp;tails are&nbsp;a bit monotonous with all the Mixels joints, but they go fast so don&#39;t detract much from the overall experience.</p>

<h2><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></h2>

<p><strong><img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/480/32395066360_ab8fa1e1d9_c.jpg"" /></strong></p>

<p>This has to be one of my favorite sets of 2016, if not of all time. The details are well done and the build is loaded with interesting techniques. I still think the tower is unnecessary, though I&#39;m not sure what the parts could have been used for - maybe a more substantial tail for the dragon. The legs feel a little big compared to the body (they look better than in the official image), and the use of the A-frame for them is a bit strange, and the tails likewise feel too short, but all things considered these are minor issues. For the price this is a fantastic offering, and it&#39;s even better considering the discounts you can get from Amazon or Bricklink. Definitely recommend this set.</p>
