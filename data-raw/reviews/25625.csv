"Fredaholic","2017-05-20T14:25:32.117Z","The Lighthouse Siege Is Amazing","<p>To be started the Lighthouse siege was a setting back in season 2 When the team met Dr.Julien after Samukai&nbsp;Prisoned Him after he left we thought no one was on the lighthouse anymore ,but in skybound&nbsp;We Learned that a Echo Zane and Tai-D Robots were still there.</p>

<p>Minifigs:</p>

<p>Jay:Its the basic Jay for the airjitzu&nbsp;Outfits and Skybound series,Hes Normal and has a Sword Holder on his back to hold 1 Sword he also is the Main holder of the Zip Line Holder</p>

<p>Nya:Same As Jay but has her color Maroonish&nbsp;Red and also has a Sword Holder But She Has only 1 Sword</p>

<p>Echo Zane:EXCLUSIVE Yay The Printed Torso has a Spoiler for Hands of time as Echo Zane&#39;s Heart is a Clock as for Dr.Julien couldn&#39;t&nbsp;make the same Zane with the only parts from the lighthouse</p>

<p>Tai-D:The Exclusive {I think} Printed Piece is super nice and his Body is Great Detailed</p>

<p>Villians:The Wicked Djn and his Sky Pirates:This set includes:Nadakhan The Djn Himself,Flinlocke Loyal as any pirate and First Mate,Clancee a Unknown Snake Tribe that holds a Broom with 2 Pieces,and Squiffy&nbsp;One of the 2 Newest Mates the other is Bucko Not included</p>

<p>Whats That Flyer You see:</p>

<p>Well the Sky Pirates have flight in almost every set and in this set They come with a New Flyer a Very detailed and playable Flyer</p>

<p>-Able to Hold 2 Figures at Once</p>

<p>-Has a Flame to Activate the 6 Stud Shooter</p>

<p>-Wings are Made Super Good</p>

<p>-Has 6 Extra Orange Studs incase You Lose One</p>

<p>-Control for the Driver and a Thing to hold for the passenger</p>

<p>THE LIGHTHOUSE:</p>

<p>starting at the Front Bottem Left theres a Little Thing on Water making sense because this is a Lighthouse,it&nbsp;is nicely Detailed with swords and a Line connected to the Main Build.Overall i&nbsp;think its a great Little Addition not to make the Lighthouse look Plain and i look foward to lego doing the same thing to other big sets like they did with the City Of Stiix</p>

<p>Now going to the lighthouse I will start at the Very top where there is a Wind Thing and if u push down on it {It Looks Loose when you touch it but it wont go out Trust me} a Light will appear</p>

<p>Next theres a nice detailed Roof Thing Surrounding the Wind Thing and Below It has some Cross Bow Stud Shooters which are great because you can fight the Flyer in the air</p>

<p>the Below level has a Interior of a Hidden tiger widow Venom which can be hidden as a Table then pop up,theres also 2 Seats next to it.On the opposite side of that theres a Tnt Launcher which has a Bright Red Nob That Shoots tnt to below,If your Precise Enough you can hit someone Next to the door below,In the Show this was Nya and Jay Throwing Pans and Pots</p>

<p>Speaking of Below this is the Level with the Entrance,When you open the door you can activate a Spring Loaded Shooter Which acctualy&nbsp;Happend in the show,Clancee Opens the door and a spring comes out.Interior includes a Blueprint,Table,and tools for the falcon,a Bin to keep the Tnt,and the spring of course</p>

<p>Did i mention the entire thing opens up? No i did not well when you do a Ladder falls down so Minifigs can get into the basemeant which has a Prison Cell and Mini workshop which Dr.Julien used to Make the robots and things</p>

<p>The Stairs Have a Feature theres 1 vine that you pull to open the Ground up and it will drop to the prison cell,didn&#39;t remember this happening in the show but ok its still fun also the first half of stairs is made with technic Pins so it can Slide up but no one paid attention to that</p>

<p>theres also a zip line and a tool a Minifig can use to Zip Down</p>

<p>Overall Great set 100% Good in My Opinion Definatly Recommend</p>

"BrickNerd2k16","2017-05-25T22:53:03.423Z","A Real Underrated Gem of the NINJAGO Line","<p>After seeing&nbsp;the preliminary images of this set I knew this was one I wanted. My first impressions were that it included many of the minifigures I hadn&#39;t got from the first wave and the exterior&nbsp;looked really good as a display piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So the bar was raised high for this set, let&#39;s find out whether it met my expectations...</p>

<p>Before we begin I want to mention that this set is based of the Season 6 scenes on the island, not the Season 2 scenes. if you need catching up on what happened&nbsp;<a href=""http://ninjago.wikia.com/wiki/Lighthouse_Prison"">Click Here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>The box features the new &quot;Day of the Departed&quot; Logo at the top featuring Cole with his new ghost scar. The bottom of the box shows all eight minifigures which we&#39;ll look at in a minute.</p>

<p>The back of the box shows of many of the play features on this set and gives you a better look at the interior of the lighthouse.</p>

<p>Inside there are six bags and a variety of large base-plates&nbsp;for building up the floor.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>This build can take a while, especially for younger builders. It probably took me at least a couple of hours. Much of the building however is fairly basic and there isn&#39;t much technic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As always a brick separator&nbsp;is included if you need to take parts apart for any reason.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>As always I&#39;ll list a few of the most interesting/new/rare parts in this set.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6156679/tassel"">6156679</a>&nbsp;in Black</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6157554/plate-1x1-round-w-3-2-shaft"">6157554</a>&nbsp;in Black</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6156256/shoulder-armour"">6156256</a>&nbsp;in Dark Green</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6064023/skeleton-leg"">6064023</a>&nbsp;in Light Bluish Grey</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6121787/fx-light-2x3x1-1-3-yellow"">6121787</a>&nbsp;with Yellow Light</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6147213/mini-wig-crewcut"">6147213</a>&nbsp;in Pearl Gold</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>A whooping Eight minifigures are included in this set! According to the database five are exclusive to this set, however this includes minor changes like the shoulder armor on the pirates.</p>

<p>Jay has a new double-sided head which shows a worried expression on one side and a confident grin on the other. He uses the same torso print found in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70602-1/Jay-s-Elemental-Dragon"">70602 Jay&#39;s Elemental Dragon</a>&nbsp;and sports the one sided shoulder armor which can hold the twin Katana&nbsp;found in the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nya is identical to the version found in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70604-1/Tiger-Widow-Island"">70604 Tiger Widow Island</a>&nbsp;and like Jay she has the shoulder armor and the two Katana. She only gets a one-sided face and it would have been nice to give a more worried expression as well.</p>

<p>Tai-D (Gizmo) is a small housecleaning robot whose is more of a brick-based build than a minifigure, but &nbsp;looks good all the same. He uses a new print on a 1x1 Cylinder and while a 1x1 Cone would have been more accurate I can understand the choice to go with the cylinder. He also has a helmet which is way to big for him. It looks even weirder when you put the goggles down. I found you can solve this problem by just adding a stud in-between&nbsp;to raise the helmet just enough to make it look better.</p>

<p>Echo Zane is going to be a huge draw for big fans of the show. The printing on this character is done really nicely to show that he has gotten run down after Dr. Julien left. I also like that it bears resemblance&nbsp;to Zane himself, especially on the face. It&#39;s nice to see that hairpiece in Pearl Gold for the first time which is another reason to get this set.</p>

<p>Squiffy is again identical to his appearance in&nbsp;70604&nbsp;Tiger&nbsp;Widow&nbsp;Island&nbsp;which I think is fine. It&#39;s nice to get more of these generic pirates and Squiffy is the closest to that. He still has some nice printing on his torso and legs. I can&#39;t really complain as I&#39;m always glad to get lots of minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Clancee&nbsp;is my favorite pirate from the series. I already had the other version of him from&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70603-1/Raid-Zeppelin"">70603 Raid Zeppelin</a>&nbsp;but I really like his head mold so I don&#39;t mind getting him again. He has the same torso and legs as before. The only difference is he gets the armor on his shoulders.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flintlocke&nbsp;is similar to Clancee in that he traded in the Epaulettes&nbsp;for shoulder armor. He also uses his hairpiece instead of the helmet which we saw in other sets. Apart from that the printing for the torso and legs are identical. I do like that LEGO tried to make the set as accurate as possible by giving each character their correct accessories instead of just reusing the old minifigures. I like that each of the pirates have their own personality which makes them much more fun to watch than other enemies in NINJAGO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nadakhan makes his second appearance&nbsp;in this set, this is a slightly cheaper alternative to getting him if you don&#39;t want the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70605-1/Misfortune-s-Keep"">70605 Misfortunes Keep</a>. He uses an exclusive mold for his extra two arms, although because of the printing for the sky pirates logo it makes it hard to use this piece elsewhere. The rest of the figure is very simple as far as printing goes. I&#39;ve had trouble getting the hairpiece to stay in place, but I found&nbsp;adding in a black 1x1 hollow stud solves that problem.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Set</strong></p>

<p>There are plenty of videos and pictures that show of the play features of this&nbsp;set, so in order to not have this review drag on I&#39;m just going to touch on my favorite and least favorite parts.</p>

<p>The overall look of the model is really good. I currently having this sitting on top of my desk and it looks marvelous. It doesn&#39;t bother me that the back is open because if you find the right angle for this you can have it so you never notice. I also really like the sheer number of little details on the interior which can really expand play. I really think kids will get a lot of fun out of this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of the trapdoor feature you really have to pull the actuator just right and even then the hole isn&#39;t big enough for figures (especially with accessories) to fall down.&nbsp;I also don&#39;t like the look of the zipline. It works well in play but for display I would recommend removing it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You also get a small flyer for the pirates which makes it more of a fair fight and it&#39;s a nice little small build.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I think this really checks a lot of boxes for me. I found myself really enjoying the play features and the look of the building. There aren&#39;t many random colors that stick out and it just looks good. There aren&#39;t many sets that have amazing minifigures that I feel are just as good as the build, but when I find one I really have to appreciate the work the designers do to make these fantastic models. This is a really underrated gem of the Ninjago line and I would highly recommend this to anyone who is into LEGO at all.&nbsp;</p>

"Lego_gend_of_zelda","2018-05-17T12:52:18.31Z","A great set on all acounts for all lego fans","<p>At first when i got this set i mainly wanted it for the minifigs&nbsp;(plus it was 30% of) but after the build (which&nbsp;was fun and not in the least repetitive) i found it was an extremely great display set looking much better in person then on the box and Even&nbsp;i who mainly collects sets for seting up displays found this set extremely fun to play with &nbsp;recreating&nbsp;a siege is great so with the collection of minifigs&nbsp;and the build itself i think this set is perfect for display with extremely collectable minifigs&nbsp;and it is also a great set for kids to play with&nbsp;</p>
