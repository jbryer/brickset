<p><strong>Overall rating: 15.3 / 20 (= about 4/5)</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
I have not bought this set: this opinion was based on the presented visual and video reviews. This is not a review of actual use, but rather to verify details!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience: 3 /3.5</strong></p>

<p>Although I did not build this set, the speed-build reviews gave me some information:<br />
New techniques and constructions parts are interesting to discover in this set. Only a small something can disturb manufacturers seeking new techniques: a hand variants of colors and some pieces that move from one side to the other, it is a fairly repetitive construction ...<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Gaming Experience: 2.25 / 3</strong></p>

<p>Pretty good game experience. The four vehicles have easily removable air, the set seems to be pretty convenient to store. It may be a little cumbersome, but it is also part of the good points of this set (or bad depending on the intended use). The plane Zane offers pretty cool features, although, for some, including those who know the old model, the lack of gold wings, pointed out in a review of LEGO site in English, which is still not very annoying in the game. Too bad Nya Lloyd and do not have their place in this multi-vehicle.<br />
<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Price: 3.8 / 4</strong></p>

<p>A rather attractive price for the number of pieces of this set and the collection of figurines. It may be a little expensive by views, but I think it is a good acquisition.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Quality: 0.5 /0.5</strong></p>

<p>As always with LEGO, I assume that all parts are present (including the famous double not specified on the notice, but that&#39;s not a reason to increase the price or budget ...). Discover some of the two windshield pieces which have a shape, volume and interesting design.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Figurines: 3/3</strong></p>

<p>Varied and manageable figures, as usual with LEGO! The collection of four ninjas full, exclusive for the moment this set. various weapons and presence of big &quot;villain&quot; of the season.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Personal rating: 2.75 / 3</strong></p>

<p>A good set that will surely delight gamers with its design and, perhaps, LEGO collectors! Too bad the Cole motorcycle wheel does not tire and Nya and Lloyd are not there ...</p>

"FlameSteve24","2020-05-12T18:04:27.95Z","One of the best Ninjago sets I own.","<p>This Set has a very neat selection of Minifigures which Includes Kai, Jay, Cole, and Zane in their Day of the Departed attire. It also includes Master Chen and one of his henchmen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build consists of 5 main builds. The first being Chen&#39;s dinosaur. Next is the main bike portion. Then the two side bikes. And lastly the jet copter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The play features include combining the four vehicles into one large one. Note* Master Chen&#39;s Dinosaur will not connect unless modified using additional pieces&nbsp;not included In the set.* Other features include&nbsp;2 &ndash; 6 studed&nbsp;shooters on the main bike, 2&nbsp;spring-loaded shooters,&nbsp;one on each&nbsp;bike, A&nbsp;small jail cell on the underside&nbsp;the jet copter and fold out wings.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build process is pretty simple using mostly the traditional interlocking brick system with some technic techniques here and there for attaching wheels, bike treads, and structural support.</p>

<p>Overall, this is Easily one of the best Ninjago sets I have the pleasure in owning.&nbsp;</p>
