Having recently seen the Ninjago movie I decided to build it once before putting it to other uses. &nbsp;To be honest it was quite a fun build.</p>

<p>Once fully built the set is pretty big and really gave me the impression of good value for money. &nbsp;The underground cave is hidden by an impressive animal skull. &nbsp;Once inside, there is an impressive mechanical system that moves the platforms inside where walkways move and swing into place. &nbsp;There are computer screens and secret hiding places for weapons and blueprints and an array of different vehicles/MECs for the Ninjas to use,&nbsp;all of&nbsp;which made me think of Batmans&nbsp;cave in some ways. If i was a kid I would have loved this set, and once finished my 4 year old played nearly 2 hours non-stop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a good selection of minifigs&nbsp;(good &amp; bad guys) too&nbsp;which makes the set feel complete and good value.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an adult though, there are flaws. &nbsp;Parts of the set are a bit fragile and some parts lack clutch power. &nbsp;There are a few gaps around the place which from my perspective equates to a lack of attention to detail from the designer but to be honest that can be overlooked as it allows access for little fingers and makes it a really good playset for youngsters.</p>
