<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The usual box and instructions are on full display for Ultimate Axl but it suits his character well. The rest of the contents are par for the course. Two bags full of useful parts and a manual.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Interesting axe blades in trans-yellow and some fun weapon builds are all at your disposal with this set. When you are finished you will have this set of parts left over.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Like all the ultimate sets the figure is what makes it pop and this one is no exeption. Axl here looks brilliant in his light orange armor and trans-yellow parts. The included Nexo Powers also fit his personality. His primary power being probably the most useful for close up encounters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike regular minifugres&nbsp;Axl&#39;s torso is fused together. The arms are attached via technic pins fused to his arms. The weight of the torso and figure actually help him to stand on his own better than his other ultimate friends.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He comes with two faces and both are quite useful for his character and for play.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is like most of the ultimate sets in this line and are simple and come with some techic pieces for complete some major assemblies.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks great with the swiveling fists and a great variety of weapons for Axl. The color scheme also fits in very well with the rest of his friends and looks great on display as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this line of knights. The vibrant colors and arsenal of weapons are great and Axl&#39;s&nbsp;gets the same treatment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Great for any Nexo fan and great for those fun parts as well. Plus the builds taught here are great for similarly themed dioramas.&nbsp;</p>

One thing I may not have mentioned yet is the utter lack of anything truly technological in the packaging design imagery. The colour choices are just as bland and uninspired as the box designs of the larger sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

His printing is limited to his legs though and a small portion of the underside of his torso, unlike the other knights he does not have any back printing on what little you can see of his back underneath the large armour.</span></span></span></span></p>

Overall Axl is fairly impressive, he&rsquo;s halfway between a standard Minifigure and a Bigfig in size.</span></span></span></span></p>

The NEXO Power element is printed with a fun looking armour fist striking something and cracking it.</span></span></span></span></p>

His axe weapon switches out for a tiny buildable magnet using red and blue sloped elements as the different sides of the magnet. Like with most Ultimate sets the large fists on his back are meant to stay.</span></span></span></span></p>

And a helicopter-like stone smashing four-bladed weapon that spun around his head would have been quite deadly.</span></span></span></span></p>

I still recommend these sets for the parts and the Minifigures though. Axl is a must have figure and this is the cheapest set to get him.</span></span></span></span></p>
