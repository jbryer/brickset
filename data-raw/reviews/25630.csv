<p><strong>Packaging and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>In keeping with the line of NEXO Knights the packaging is nice and showcases our hero within.</p>

<p>Inside we get a booklet and 2 bags.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lance comes with plenty fo trans-orange and navy blue parts though Lance himself is decked in white and trans-clear pieces that make him seem more like a diamond knight than anything else.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also get a few parts in silver and two megaphone pieces and a dull dark bley color.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your left over parts are par for the course for the Ultimate series in NEXO.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>We get one figure with this set and it is Lance Richmond himself. His gear made him difficult to photograph with my current set up but like all figures in this line so far he is well printed though his weapons do take some adjusting in order to get him to stand up correctly.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build and Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>The build came together quickly as it follows the pattern of all the Ultimates so far. The strangest build was his backpack. The wings are fully poseable and make quite the display piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model with Lance on top looks pretty good. The NEXO&nbsp;powers included are decent though as with all of these some are better than others. Still it is &nbsp;fun little set and for completionists it is a must knight to add to the collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>As with all things NEXO this set alone is will not last long but it is a good playset. The knight comes with plenty to do and plenty of options for his arsenal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you can snag it on sale jump on it. He looks great(though somewhat silly with that big diamond studded lance)&nbsp;with his diamond armor and lance.&nbsp;</p>

This is one of the last ones I needed to get all of the NEXO Knights in their Ultimate forms, and this one is&hellip; strangely amusing considering the character involved. It&rsquo;s a fun little set, however not as strong as some of the other offerings from the line, here&rsquo;s the review to discuss how the set holds up.</span></span></span></span></p>

However it has been a while since then. I&rsquo;m still much fonder concerning these sets compared to the old style of collectible sets from Ninjago and Chima in the past.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Ultimate Lance: This version of Lance includes numerous print detailing, however the truly impressive aspect of this figure is that his legs, torso and armour are all done to give the impression that Lance is the White Knight. He features a white torso and legs with highly detailed printing for his armour and the slide-on shoulder armor is completely clear Abs plastic.</span></span></span></span></p>

I particularly like the one eye winking with the big smile on his lips as it is just so full of character. His main accessory is the NEXO power shield and a buildable lance weapon which uses the Space blaster for a base&hellip; It&rsquo;s a very impressive looking lance tipped with a diamond, a really fun looking weapon.</span></span></span></span></p>

Let&rsquo;s move on to the NEXO Powers.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Take Off: This Power includes a jet pack, it&rsquo;s a minor looking build with some nice slightly adjustable wings, the wings are attached via Technic pieces and so can only be angled slightly, but they can rotate and are able to fit in a flying pose and a resting pose for when Lance is standing on the ground.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Sea Dragon: Not much here, it&rsquo;s a stud launcher weapon. There are no new attachments for the backpack, Lance can keep the jet pack, but it isn&rsquo;t much of a change.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Charge Attack: This also has very little to it when it comes to accessories. Two old school LEGO megaphones are featured with orange studs on the tips, these are some kind of energy launchers I suspect, though they can&rsquo;t launch or fire. It&rsquo;s really not much of anything.</span></span></span></span></p>

That being said if you can find this in a clearance section somewhere this set is definitely worth picking up. I&rsquo;d recommend this to finish off the Ultimate NEXO Knights and have the full set, however if you missed out on this one it&rsquo;s safe to skip it. Mildly recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
