<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box shows a brave Royal Guard attacking the Glob Lobber! I hope he knows what he is doing.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The usual trans orange, deep black and brown pieces and red. Oh yeah and a few teeth! Though I was perplexed by having a whole plate left over when I was done. I keep fearing I missed a step in the build.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>With the line less than a year old already the expectations are high on the quality of the prints used on the figures and as with their twin brethren in other sets these do the job quite nicely.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A rather simple build but the color scheme matches those of previous sets thus unifying all your attack sets for your Lava monsters.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I feel rather sorry for this Royal Guard. With only his spear he has no chance against a fully armed Glob Lobber and its Flame Thrower operator who can also use the Glob Lobber&#39;s decorative elements as weapons!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I have been totally won over by this line. Having this little set along side the other smaller Nexo Knight sets really starts to sprout a fun diorama of armor and machines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you love this line then you will likely enjoy this set for the play features, wonderful and well printed minifigures. A great addition to your Lava Army arsenal.&nbsp;</p>
