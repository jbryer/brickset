"sparrownest","2016-05-26T21:25:43.05Z","Macy commutes in style","<p>The summer wave of Nexo&nbsp;gets a good start with a sleek racer trike&nbsp;for Macy, dual rotating cannons swivel up for taking care of business (Lord and mundane)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Two small booklets made it an easy build (age 7), as the steps are clear and gradual. Box art almost to scale of finished build. Total of 8 pages inside for ads, due to printing set up but still ...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Great selection of trans orange, including a full extra set of &quot;bullets&quot; (more than 24 in total). Sleek windshield and rotating gears hidden to raise the two rotation&nbsp;guns. Five pointed &quot;pyramids&quot; for the mace, and a shield with holder - being Nexo after all.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Macy and bot both with dual faces, great printing and small details. Bit strange that her red is so close to the Crust Smasher / lava monsters. Definitely need to pick up a pack of extra monsters either as followers or foes, as the lone one is sorely matched by the bot alone, never mind the full awesomeness of the Thunder Mace.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy and straight forward build, but he has quite a bit of experience, so 8-14 not to far off. The wheels took some adjustments to get rolling freely, was easy to fix to hard (similar issue with Skybound&nbsp;Ninjago bikes)</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Was almost surprisingly good, looks and runs smoother than the box art gave impression of. The half height windscreen looks strange with Macy sitting there, but on its own lifts the impression. Handful of stickers add to the model, but could be left off for more flexible rebuilding.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Good set, we picked it up at the (<i>soon to become</i>) traditional &quot;few days early&quot; roll out at BR Leker, giving some extra bonus points at school. It impressed by sleekness and being solid while drive around. Having the guns rotate rather than just flip up probably helps overall stability.&nbsp;</p>

"Japanbuilder","2016-08-19T16:05:12.717Z","Macy crushes everything!","<p>Macy&#39;s Thunder Mace is an average set. However, this is made up for by the nice selection of figures which really add to your Nexo Knight collection.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box art shows off the action features though even here the action is pretty bland since there is only one opponent and he may as well be fighting this thing barehanded. He brings only two swords to this cannon fight.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As usual for this line there are lots of navy blue pieces and trans orange pieces to be found. The set also comes with huge wheels and rather long technic beams. There is also a single sticker sheet with 9 stickers included in the set. When you finish you&#39;ll have a sword and a printed tile left over. This along with a lot of trans orange studs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set has great mini figures. I don&#39;t believe any of them are new. But it is great to get Macy in this slightly cheaper set. The prints are phenomenal in the Nexo line and these are classic examples of why the line is fun.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build involved a lot of technic pins and sadly left a huge chunk of the holes native to technic exposed all over the model. It was an average experience and younger builders may be frustrated by the attention to pin placement as the main play features of the vehicle do have technic gears to activate the play items.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>To me this model felt too bland. The Lava monster included stands no chance which makes getting this set by itself probably not that great for a builder looking for more action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The set is so-so, however, if you happen to have a few other sets in the line this can be the lead vehicle while the other sets you own act in support.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even a small and simple diorama of Nexo Knights will look sharper with Macy leading an assault on the lava monsters! If you don&#39;t have Macy then this is a decent enough set to but just to get her. You can always use the parts with other Nexo&nbsp;sets to make something even cooler. Or you can combine with a few other sets and liven up the rather stale offerings of the set.&nbsp;</p>
