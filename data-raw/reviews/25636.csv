I wish that he had done it quicker, because this set is awesome to play with!</p>

<p>I have only built this set once, and it was quite fascinating to see how the entire thing holds together when it converts from its six-wheeled, lying-down mode, to the four-wheeled, standing-up mode you can see in the picture. It was a surprise for me to see the way that the top and bottom make a massive head with big white teeth, as I hadn&#39;t even noticed that when my brother built it. I admire the LEGO designer&#39;s ability to do such strange things in the Nexo Knights&nbsp;series, which has many other strange transformations like this one.</p>

<p>This model&#39;s colour scheme is quite simple, with mostly reds and browns dominating the set. The bricks that sit between the wheels are very interesting, but I am yet to find something to build with them. The set has many tooth and claw bricks, so if you plan on making some sort of creature, this set is a great source of teeth and talons.</p>

<p>The set is very fun to play with. The jail cell is well positioned, as a minifig&nbsp;can be placed inside, then when the vehicle folds down, they are trapped. It is super-easy to transform the vehicle, all you need to do is lift up the back end. The wheels also look pretty cool when you are driving it around the place at high speeds. It is almost exactly the same size as Axl&#39;s&nbsp;tower carrier, another awesome Nexo&nbsp;Knights set, so buying these two sets as a pair works very well.</p>

<p>This set is very cleverly made to feature an awesome-looking and easy transformation, and has many unique orange, red, and brown blocks. It is very playable, and features many nice tooth pieces. I cannot give you a description of the Nexo&nbsp;Powers in the set, however, because I do not play the game. But, even without the Nexo&nbsp;Powers, this set is certainly worth buying.</p>
