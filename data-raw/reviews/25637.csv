It is my favourite&nbsp;&#39;Good Guys&#39; vehicle in the series, but the Burnzie monster is a cool bad guy too.</p>

<p>This set was very enjoyable to build, particularly the front of the vehicle. I like the way that it uses a variety of different joint pieces to make a stunning bumper for the vehicle. However, I did feel that the six wheels were a little lazy. I really like brick-built wheels, rather than single-piece wheels, and the LEGO group haven&#39;t even bother making these wheels look nice a all! Although, I do like the way that some bricks fill the gaps between the wheels to make them seem as if they are part&nbsp;the vehicle, rather than simply stuck on the outside like most wheels.</p>

<p>If you are looking for blue parts, then this set is for you! Most of the decorations are stickers, so you won&#39;t have to worry about all sorts of buttons and stripes ending up in a&nbsp;brick-built ocean! Burnzie&#39;s hammer has two cool-looking black pieces on either end, sort of like massive cogs. This set features some interesting pieces, but unless you are looking for blue pieces, I would not buy this one.</p>

<p>This set is interesting one to play with, the main feature of it is that the tower mounted on the back can detach and drive around freely. I wouldn&#39;t recommend sending the tower barrelling down a slope, as it will probably fall over. Once free of the tower, a catapult can unfold from the carrier, giving more space inside, and a cool-looking weapon to fling bricks at Burnzie with! This set makes a nice pair with General Magmar&#39;s Seige Machine Of Doom, which is basically the &#39;Bad Guy&#39; equivalent of this set, but with a different cool feature.</p>

<p>This set makes both a brilliant model and toy, with interesting uses of pieces and cool features, but I would not buy it for it&#39;s pieces, unless I wanted some smooth blue bricks, or some massive black wheels. Overall, it is a great set that would make a great addition to your Nexo&nbsp;Knights collection.</p>
