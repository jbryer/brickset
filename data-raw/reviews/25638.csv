It is jam-packed with removable items, moving parts, and funny builds. I got this set for Christmas and I am absolutely awestruck with it.</p>

<p>Building this set was amazing. My favorite part was probably the massive, spinning monster beside the lava-fall. (A&nbsp;waterfall, but with lava!) It kind of reminds me of the Sarlacc&nbsp;from Star Wars. This set contains many funny and odd builds that keep it very entertaining to build. Some examples of this are the red-and-black checkered bed, and the bathtub complete with a yellow rubber duck.</p>

<p>This set may look like it is dominated by blacks and oranges, but there are many very awesome small pieces throughout it, including, but not limited to; a chicken piece inside a cage in the kitchen, about a bazillion tooth pieces, a generous amount of black slope pieces (these are good for making roofs on houses with), and transparent orange chains. I don&#39;t know where I would use these chains, but they look really cool.</p>

<p>This set has heaps of cool features. Both Jestro&#39;s and Lavaria&#39;s&nbsp;seats easily disconnect from the bulk of the set and become little flying vehicles. A clever combination of gear allows the Sarlacc-monster to spin around RIDICULOUSLY fast, and the trapdoor-bridge above it allows for some fairly epic (if not cheesy) story-making. There is a library with a few of the monster books behind a wall capable of being blown apart, and a prison with an easily topple-able wall feature.</p>

<p>I usually have something bad to say about a LEGO set, but this one has ticked every box nicely. It is relatively cheap for a set of it&#39;s size, and has quite a few cool and helpful pieces. The only thing wrong with it is the age recommendation - this set is so awesome that&nbsp;<em>everybody&nbsp;</em>should be allowed to build it. This set is a brilliant way to finish off your Nexo&nbsp;Knights collection, and also a great starting set, as it displays greatly the amazing creativity and ingenuity found in all the Nexo&nbsp;Knights sets of the original series.</p>
