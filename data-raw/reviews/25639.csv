"TheBigBB","2016-04-09T08:26:13.81Z","Small for what it's supposed to be; should have been a bigger set","<p>I was interested in this set as soon as I saw it because of the Ava figure and the fact that it&#39;s supposed to attach to the Fortrex, which is my favorite set in this theme.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The depiction on the box is perfectly accurate, and the instructions are excellent as almost all Lego instruction manuals are.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Basic Nexo Knight&nbsp;parts that&nbsp;are plentiful&nbsp;in in other much&nbsp;better sets like the Fortrex. The only things I can think of&nbsp;that might be exclusive are the small bits like the book and the Nexo powers.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The highlight of the set is the exclusive&nbsp;Ava figure, who is also&nbsp;one of the relatively few female figures in Nexo Knights. She has a really nice hair piece.</p>

<p>Lance appears in a few sets in various forms, and has a cheaper set that bears his name. This version differs a little from the others in what gear he has.</p>

<p>Crust Smasher appears in one of the $10 sets, but I find all of these bad guys to be almost the same in appearance so I never get a set based on them.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The middle tower is fun to build while it lasts. It is stabilized by a technic element so it&#39;s a lot more than just stacking bricks.&nbsp;The walls aren&#39;t that interesting as they are so small and contain so few pieces.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The tower is perfectly fine from the front, but the back has inexplicably exposed technic racks that could easily have been covered up with some flat pieces. There isn&#39;t much room to place the figures on, as the thing is so tiny. Attached to the Fortex, it&#39;s kind of ridiculous because it just makes the Fortrex&nbsp;easily accessed by the enemy who could simply step over the tiny walls.</p>

<p>There is a projectle that shoots out of the front, but since the tower doesn&#39;t actually move, the enemy would have to walk right into its path to be struck.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a small enemy vehicle that&#39;s clearly only there to make the set playable by itself, but&nbsp;it &nbsp;actually might be able to take on the somewhat unimpressive&nbsp;Merlok Tower.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t see how this is really a library or a reasonable attachment to an impenetrable&nbsp;beast of a castle&nbsp;like the Fortrex. The walls are way too small. The main reason I would recommend buying one of these sets is to get Ava, and because it&#39;s really not that expensive.</p>

<p>If you want to buy two (or more) Merlok Libraries, you could make it a much better set by making the walls much higher. If you bought enough of these, you could even assemble a whole castle! However, I would not recommend doing something like this unless you already own the Fortrex, which is a much more unique and cool castle than anything you might make with Merlok&#39;s Library.</p>

<p>Anyway, I only can recommend this to Nexo Knights fans. If you&#39;re not sold on this theme, start elsewhere. Even the $10 catapult would be a better starting point.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts included are the norm for this line. Browns and oranges for the &quot;bad guys&quot; and blue and reddish orange for the knights. 2 bags are included in this set along with a sticker sheet with 7 stickers. Every single sticker is clear in nature and quite a hassle to get on straight as they&#39;re also quite long. Needless to say despite superhuman patience you will end up with smudged images and fingerprints all over these stickers. You&#39;ll have some trans pieces as spares along with a few spiky tiles and some fangs, not to mention a number of technic pins and connector pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You also get two nexo powers, though in relation to others powers in the line these are not as useful.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigure selection is quite good for the knights but very dry for the lava monsters. We get Lance along with a jet pack build and Ava with her signature hand held gaming device. The Crust Smasher has been in a few sets but retains its wonderful prints throughout. The Book of Monsters included is excellent. The new book design is fantastic it has printed work on the cover and on the inner tile and can be held by figures while still functioning as a book.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was average though again with reliance on plenty of technic parts. These may be difficult for younger builders to bear with but they are crucial in the stability and play features of the enemy craft and structure.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks pretty decent. It can also be connected to the Fortrex&nbsp;for added play. For a set called a library, however, the inclusion of one book seems some what odd. It looks more like an outpost or gatehouse that the knights can use to delay a major enemy attack at best, a simple bump in the road at worst. The figures make up for the very small nature of the set and it comes with a fun version of Lance since he has a jet pack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest flaw is the stickers. Since two are applied to trans-orange red pieces they need to be transparent. They were hard to line up and despite my best efforts still ended up off-kilter. That the rest of the stickers which are applied to solid colors were also transparent also didn&#39;t help much.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vehicle for the Crust Smasher is actually the better build. It works and looks fantastic plus the printed ball element it uses as ammo is awesome looking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[url=https://flic.kr/p/KuXjDA][img]https://c5.staticflickr.com/9/8156/28550996804_c88f88fab5.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/KuXjDA]P8231867[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/139708441@N07/]Macster Tome[/url], on Flickr</p>

<p>[url=https://flic.kr/p/KuXiko][img]https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8310/28550992384_579746b0ee.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/KuXiko]P8231874[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/139708441@N07/]Macster Tome[/url], on Flickr</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall it is an average set. The bad guy actually has a powerful vehicle and it seems like the knight has no chance against it either as he can be knocked over by that ball rather easily despite his heavy equipment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For imaginative play, however, the possibilities are endless. The walls can be folded in and out quite a ways. With multiples of these you can make an actual mini fort though I would recommend the Fortrex&nbsp;instead&nbsp;as that is a proper fort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with a few of the sets in this line having a few other Nexo sets livens up the scene and adds more to do for an imagined adventure. Also buy it when it is on sale if you do really want it.&nbsp;</p>

It&rsquo;s ability is obviously to launch a stream of poison or something similar at the Lava Monsters&hellip; Pretty dangerous if Lance aimed at the wrong person and accidentally hit a friend.</span></span></span></span></p>

I&rsquo;m not a fan of the price for it though as we&rsquo;ll discuss more shortly. Overall this model isn&rsquo;t terrible, however I will note that it could have stood to have a slightly taller external wall structure for better defense, the middle sections of the walls should have had more parts added to make them taller and add more places for characters to stand while keeping the connector elements on both side at the same height for matching up with the Fortrex.</span></span></span></span></p>
