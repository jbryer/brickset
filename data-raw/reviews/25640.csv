"TheBigBB","2016-04-21T08:02:05.873Z","A versatile monster construction that's a blast to play with.","<p>The title of this set&nbsp;is potentially&nbsp;a bit misleading. Infernox only captures the queen if you want him to. For me, this set is &quot;Infernox&nbsp;Captures Mungus&quot;. (more on that later)&nbsp;In any case, I was happy to pick this&nbsp;up to give the King&#39;s mech&nbsp;a suitable rival for the first wave of Nexo Knights sets, but I was pleasantly surprised by its overall&nbsp;playability.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Excellent box that shows everything about the set very clearly. One instruction booklet, great quality as usual. There could have been two, but it&#39;s a small enough set that it&#39;s not an issue.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Virtually all Nexo Knights sets&nbsp;have at least a few exclusive printed pieces because of the Nexo&nbsp;Power pieces. This set also has printed projectiles with funny faces on them. Some of the translucent orange&nbsp;pieces stood out, like&nbsp;Infernox&#39;s&nbsp;spiky shoulder pieces. The chest/mouth&nbsp;has those thick angular pieces that have a mix of black and translucent orange. Aaron has a crossbow that shoots orange pieces that look kind of like microphones. Basically, it&#39;s a&nbsp;decent selection of parts for a 253 piece set. These&nbsp;could certainly be useful for some MOCs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two minifigures isn&#39;t that great, especially when Lance&#39;s Mecha Horse got three for fewer pieces. However, you are getting an exclusive and important character in Queen Halbert.&nbsp;Her&nbsp;look is distinct&nbsp;within this theme;&nbsp;she has a printed piece for legs, a cape, and a special hair piece.</p>

<p>Aaron, on the other hand, is a pretty typical Nexo Knight figure, but that&#39;s&nbsp;only natural for this theme. Almost every set has a Nexo Knight, and they should.</p>

<p>Each figure has two expressions on the face depending on how you turn the head, too. Aaron can be concentrating or grinning. The Queen can look stoic or completely pissed off.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There isn&#39;t anything too complex or interesting going on with the build. The set&#39;s minimum suggested age is 8, but I think you could let a younger child build this one. This isn&#39;t a negative necessarily, as there is nothing wrong with the build. It just happens to not be a memorable one.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Aaron&#39;s hover&nbsp;horse is has a nice aesthetic to it, other than the somewhat ugly green used on a few of the pieces. I like that it has holders for the weapon and shield. If you turn the crossbow&#39;s holder a bit from how it&#39;s shown in the instructions, you can make it point directly forward rather than awkwardly sticking out diagonally. I like that the head of the horse can be moved to help depict its momentum. When compressed, it looks like it&#39;s&nbsp;sitting still. When elongated, it looks like it&#39;s rushing forward.</p>

<p>Infernox is a highly posable&nbsp;monster&nbsp;with two ball joints on each limb, a mouth and&nbsp;chest that opens up from three points, a tail that can be raised, and moving claw fingers. He holds his&nbsp;hammer cannon weapon using&nbsp;a technic hole, so it&#39;s not likely to fall off&nbsp;during play. You have plenty of space to fit figures inside of him, too. I was able to fit Mungus from the Chima theme in there, even. Mungus is a GIANT figure that&#39;s literally 5x as large as a normal minifigure, so it&#39;s really impressive that he can fit inside Infernox. Granted, the mouth can&#39;t completely envelop him, but he fits and stays put. Infernox can pretty much eat anyone short of the giant man on the Superhero Airport Battle.&nbsp;I love that.</p>

<p>The only downside of the completed build is that Infernox looks kind of awful from the back due in large part&nbsp;to the uncovered technic racks. I guess you can just get some extra pieces and do it yourself if it bothers you. I just don&#39;t understand why this wasn&#39;t part of the official build.</p>

<p>One last thing to mention is that you can hitch Infernox to Jestro&#39;s Evil Mobile to pull it instead of the standard figure that comes with that set. I would rather have Infernox&nbsp;out doing battle and eating people,&nbsp;but he does look good pulling it&nbsp;due to his much larger size.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s an okay value at exactly 10 cents per piece. Queen Halbert is a nice&nbsp;figure to have, and Aaron&#39;s horse is cool. Infernox is sturdy and&nbsp;very fun to play with. His ability to eat just about anyone offers plenty of opportunity for amusing scenes with your Nexo Knights collection. If you don&#39;t have any other Nexo Knights sets, have a blast making Infernox&nbsp;show up to unrelated themes and eat stuff. The set earns a 5 overall rating even if just for the playability. I think anyone who actually plays with their Legos will love Infernox.</p>

"Wookiesmasher13","2016-05-29T13:24:52.26Z","A Nexo Knights Test, and it passed.","<p>Box/Instructions I bought this set to see if I like the Nexo Knights Theme, and it has passed with flying colors. I thought that, at best, I would have a decent starting point. At worst, I would have some nice parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;After Built, I am very pleased.</p>

<p>Parts &nbsp; &nbsp;The Robo-Horse has some neon-orange wrenches and a motorcycle frame. The shields are new and I am not able to obtain the app. I prefer displaying the green and orange one instead of the red dragon because it matches Aaron better.</p>

<p>Minifigures&nbsp; &nbsp;The Aaron Fox &nbsp;looks exactly what a space knight should, thick armor, heavy weapons, and neon elements. Queen Hama Halbert looks very regal, not what I&#39;d wear to get eaten by a lava monster, but who knows. Both have double faces, Halbert with one royal and one looks like she&#39;s really mad. Fox has one normal face and one with a big smile. I don&#39;t understand how come his bow comes with flames, when he is fighting LAVA monsters, but that can be changed or replaced with one from a different set.</p>

<p>The build &nbsp; &nbsp; The Robo-Horse looks a bit clunky carrying all his gear, but is still acceptable. It is a nice hover-bike, but the meat of the set in Infernox. Infernox&nbsp;is about the size of the Hulk buster, and&nbsp;he has a nice club and some other features&nbsp;and I do not like the club shooting feature, it just seems out of place. It might be a play-feature, but not really something I want to accidentally shoot whenever I move it around. The mouth is completely diffrent, I think it does provide a good play-feature and looks alright for capturing Queens or transporting Lava Monsters.</p>

<p>The completed model &nbsp; I was skeptical of Nexo Knights in the beginning, but I am completely convinced now. The completed model is basically what Lego should be: a set that can be on a shelf or scattered on the floor equally comfortable. The entire set is great as a whole.</p>

<p>Overall opinion &nbsp; I love this set as a whole.</p>

While missing a crown for her head, she still looks quite regal. Her torso is double-sided with printing of her courtly robes, including a fancy necklace. Her lower torso is a sloped brick printed on front with a sash and the Halbert family crest.</span></span></span></span></p>

Her hair was used for the Weeping Angel in LEGO Ideas. I believe it was used for CMF Series 7 Bride first, it certainly looks quite familiar. She has a cape, the older style, not the soft-goods style used in more recent Super Hero sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

I have no idea what the power does, perhaps it lets Aaron travel through time briefly to prevent a disastrous event from happening during his quest to rescue the queen. Ok print, not sure what other uses it could have for MOC fans though.</span></span></span></span></p>

Then you build the central torso and lower jaws of the Lava Monster. This build is pretty fun, the little mechanical horse is a great little build and uses the LEGO Motorcycle chassis in a very clever way.</span></span></span></span></p>

The build winds up looking hollow, but that&rsquo;s to accommodate his gimmick. His two lower jaws are on separate hinges and their construction is pretty impressive.</span></span></span></span></p>

Then we come to the legs and arms. There&rsquo;s certain elements of repetitiveness in the builds of the limbs as they are mirror twins of each other. Lastly Infernox gets a massive hammer which includes the disc launcher we were introduced to in Chima. Overall not a difficult build and pretty fun as you slowly put a giant hulking monstrous beast together to prepare to attack.</span></span></span></span></p>

Most younger fans might not know about this, but these robot horses remind me a lot of Bravestar. It isn&rsquo;t exactly the same design, but it&rsquo;s certainly one of the more impressive looking models. It uses the motorcycle chassis to great effect to make a swooping flying horse, it also stores Aaron&rsquo;s weapons effectively. Overall a great little model.</span></span></span></span></p>

As a bonus it can interact with other sets quite nicely, Infernox can capture the queen, store her in his mouth and then take over from Sparkks and tow Jestro&rsquo;s Evil Mobile into battle. Definitely a great set and slightly better deal for 30$ than Merlok&rsquo;s Library, mostly due to the slightly larger piece count and more solid looking design.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Hashem1983","2017-06-15T11:32:08.45Z","Exceeded My Expectations","<p>Most of my Lego purchases nowadays are online, and as long as its with a reasonable price and the set worth the purchase I go for it.</p>

<p>Though when the reviling of the first images of the theme I wasn&#39;t too much interested in it until I saw the High Quality images and getting into the details it was then the interest begun.</p>

<p>As any Lego set, the box has the Nexo Knight label theme, the front&nbsp;displays the monster capturing the queen while Aaron riding his Hover horse attacking the monster to save the queen, as for the back it displays the features of the set.</p>

<p>Inside the box 1 Instruction booklet and 2 numbered bags that contains the parts.</p>

<p>The set has two&nbsp;Mini-Figures:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Aaron: he has double printed torso in grey metallic and lime green with printed legs, he also gets an Armour&nbsp;and a lime green helmet and holds a crossbow shooter as a weapon, and finally for the face, double printed face, a happy face and a very much HAPPIER face expression.</li>
	<li>The Queen: one of the most unique mini-figuer in my entire Lego collection, as this is the first mini-figuer I get with a dress outfit instead of legs, her torso is double printed in blue, the arms are in lighter blue and has white hands as gloves and she is also wearing a dark blue cape. As for her hair piece, it is modest as how a queen should look with a whole on top that you could place any kind of accessory in it like a tiara. She has a double sided face, a modest smiling face and an angry face, and that face is used when the monster captures her.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The building experience for a mid size set was interesting from the Hover Horse to the monster itself,&nbsp;though I thought the building of the monster&#39;s legs and arms are&nbsp;going to be a bit dull boring due to its simplicity but it was not. The most building experience was in the main body of the monster as it did require a bit&nbsp;of attention. I liked how the mouth and eyes were built, especially the mouth that adds a good play feature in this set.</p>

<p>The complete model is nice, it has lots of playability, plus I could see in this theme that the bad guys section or the monsters section could be mixed with the normal Castle themes. I also see that the monster could be used as a mech for disguise.&nbsp;I just want to ass that I do have an extra tiara that I have put on the queen and yet I was able to place her inside the monster and close the mouth completely.<br />
My only 2 problem with the set are the ball joints it gets loose too often and sometimes it slips, I try to make it in a standing position and suddenly I find out the legs are spread wide. Also for Aaron or any set that has a Hover Horse, try not to let the Minifiguer&nbsp;in the Hover Horse for too long as the legs gets loose.&nbsp;<br />
But in General the set is quite beautiful and worth the purchase.<br />
I do recommend it</p>
