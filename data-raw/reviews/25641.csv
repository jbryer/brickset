<p>The box comes in a Medium size that has the Nexo Knights label on front that displays a fight between Robin inside his Black Knight Mech against the lava monsters. On the back you see the set and its features.</p>

<p>The set has 2 Instruction booklet that are easy to follow but needs a little attention, because building the set was more than wonderful and enjoyable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The Parts, in terms of colors, are mostly a&nbsp;mixture of Blue, Black, Grey and transparent Orange with some dark Brown and Dark Red. As for the pieces there are lots angle bricks, angular plates, different shapes of plates, some technic bricks and pins, ball joints and holders as well as the usual normal bricks and plates. There are so many kind of bricks that I am unable to describe.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>This set has 4 minifigures, 2 of them , to me, are unique and new to my collections:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Whiperella:</strong> The most unique figure in this set, as a lava monster, she&#39;s all red and has a printing on her torso that represents ashes&nbsp;with some yellow and orange shades, her back is also printed, as for her bottom, its not legs but the Snake lower part which make her unique, it is also printed on the front part only, the bottom part is made from hard plastic but the tale is a rubbery material. She has an angry face, although no double face but there is a printing on her back of the head that shows the ashes, she has a very unique hair piece in black, I don&#39;t know if because of that hair piece Lego didn&#39;t make her with double sided face, because I did try her hair piece on all my figures that had double sided face and it did cover it very well.</li>
	<li><strong>Ash Attacker:</strong>&nbsp;another villain, not my second favorite, more of the third favorite. The torso is double sided printed with an evil look to it, red arms and black hands, the legs are also printed including the toes. He wears a black Shoulder Armor and an evil looking helmet on his head with 2 orange horns on the side that you apply. Speaking of his head, its in red color and has 2 sided face, the eyes expressions are the same the only different thing is one side has the mouth closed and the other side is open ready to attack. He also holds a buildable&nbsp;spear that I really like, not one of those molded ones</li>
	<li><strong>Squire Bot:</strong> this is my second&nbsp;favorite figure in this set, because its unique. However, the poor thing is buildable, you add his arms and hooks, legs, the 1x1 tile with the Knighton logo on it, and a normal head shape in metallic color that has two sided face, one looks like if his mouth shut or powered off, the other face is smiling with a single tooth is missing, and it got&nbsp;a blue helmet on his head. Why did I say &quot;The poor thing&quot; because it is the one in prison to rescue.</li>
	<li><strong>Robin Underwood:</strong>&nbsp;my least favorite figure, not that I hate it but its not unique, to me. his torso is in black with double prints on it and wears one of the Nexo knights armor in gun metal grey, short black legs, as he is a kid, he also wears a helmet in gun metal grey. He has only one face printed, that is a smiley face.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The</strong><strong> Build:</strong></p>

<p>You start building the set with the minifgures, only Robin is built up later, then you build the monsters hover which has few nice tricks in it, the only thing I didn&#39;t like are the string shooters on the sides as just a simple touch makes it shoot.</p>

<p>The second Build is a small defense for the monsters, its built on an octagon dark grey silver plate, has a side for a catapult, and the other side a small buildable cell prison for the bot. It also contains a simple armory build that holds 2 type of swords, a dynamite and a buildable dagger.</p>

<p>The Third build is the Mech, and that is a very interesting build, you start up with the torso and all the way up, then you start with the legs, a little tip, both legs are the same build you just need to turn the nob on top one to the left and the other to the right. Finally you build the arms, now the shoulders have the same technique build, but in the right arm you build the entire thing with the hand and the sword, while the left arm its where it holds the shield.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Complete Model</strong><strong>:</strong></p>

<p>The Overlook of this set is wonderful and BIG, even if the mech&#39;s torso considered to be a bit bulky or blocky, still it looks nicer in real life than in images, and&nbsp;I do like keep on opening the visor and the entrance door of the mech which is on the center of the mech&#39;s body, inside there were you place Robin and there are 2 controls, one on each side. I even tried to place one of the other Nexo&nbsp;knights inside with his/her armor, and I was able to close it without any trouble in a seated way, I tried to seated on the studs but it was a bit difficult, still you are able to put a normal minifigure&nbsp;inside.</p>

<p>I also got to say about the legs, the knees the don&#39;t bend, I was accidently going to but I didn&#39;t, and the reason why because its built with a two&nbsp;angle technic pieces, 2 on each leg, that for me, it gives it a look of a hydraulic system, which are not.</p>

<p>My only cons with it are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The ball joints gets loose sometimes that makes the mech hard to stand and hard to pose the arms, sometimes the arms lower down by it self</li>
	<li>The back of the shield does not look that nice.</li>
	<li>on the back of the mech, there&#39;s a place I did not like how its look so I added transparent Orange studs from the extra parts that I have.</li>
	<li>The prison cell gets disconnected easily and sometimes its hard to place the bot inside</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong><strong>:</strong></p>

<p>The &quot;70325&nbsp;Infernox captures the Queen&quot; set was my first mech and I loved it, as for this one I loved it more, so whether this is your first mech of any kind of Lego theme you&#39;re going to love it and enjoy its building as I did, I even placed it on my desk in the office among other Lego sets.</p>

<p>Enjoy... :)</p>
