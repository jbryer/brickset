<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>On the front of the&nbsp;box there is some really good art of the set. On the back of the box it&nbsp;shows you some of the features of the mech and has advertisements for the Nexo Knights app.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set comes with some&nbsp;very good parts like small pyramid pieces in gold, a new mold of a sword in silver, the new Nexo Knights sheild&nbsp; and Nexo&nbsp;power piece and two bowcaster accessories. Also the price per price ratio is good because it 8 cents per price and it comes with 375 pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures that come in the set are King Halbert, Flamethrower, and the King&#39;s not. King Halbert has some very good printing on his legs and torso, Flamethrower has abb printing on his torso and some very detailed printing on his legs, and last but not least the King&#39;s Bot is brick-built and uses new molds for its torso, legs and shoulders and has a printed one by one tile with the King&#39;s symbol on it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build of the mech&nbsp;was very straight forward. Not too challenging and not too easy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks very nice. The space where the King&#39;s Bot sits detaches to become a ship. There are many joints on the mech so you can get some very good poses out of it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I think this set is very good in my opinion because its the only way to get King Halbert and you can get some very useful prices in a cheap set.</p>

"Plural","2016-04-24T18:39:21.163Z","A Mech that's Suit for a King","<p>The King&#39;s Mech was the Nexo Knights set I was personally looking forward to the most. Does it live up to my hype, though?</p>

<p>The answer is kind of obvious, but let&#39;s take a closer look.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>LEGO is known for having fantastic boxart, but I&#39;m not too happy with this set&#39;s. Don&#39;t get me wrong; The minifigures are shown off extremely well, the back displays all the important functions and play features included, and the border art looks amazing, but the mech&#39;s pose and action just makes it lose a few points in my book. It&#39;s seen deflecting a single stud, a feat that has been shown in previous boxes as a simple task. It just makes the mech seem a bit less powerful than it actually is, which is further orchestrated by its somewhat static pose.</p>

<p>The instructions are your average, run of the mill manual, with 72 pages in all. Besides looking a bit dark because of the two shades of blue included in the set, it&#39;s fine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m the most fluent when it comes to new molds and recolors in sets, so I&#39;ll just list some pieces that interested me.</p>

<ul>
	<li>King Halbert&#39;s&nbsp;hair piece is the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/71008-1/Classic-King"">CMF Classic King from Series 1</a>3, but recolored to orange. I personally prefer this variation.</li>
	<li>The King&#39;s bot includes two new pieces: a torso piece and two shoulders that attach to the aforementioned torso&#39;s sides. I personally don&#39;t know what a moccist can do with them, but they&#39;re cool nonetheless.</li>
	<li>The set comes with quite a few weapons, including two of the new stud-shooting crossbows, a long sword, and a new blade piece that I believe is exclusive to the Nexo Knights theme.</li>
	<li>As with all NK sets, there are two Nexo&nbsp;Powers included: The Storm Dragon and Backfire. Their prints are nice, especially the Storm Dragon.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, I would say the set comes with a nice variety of pieces that could be somewhat useful to those who need them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The King&#39;s Mech includes three minifigures, two of which are exclusive to the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First up is King Halbert, ruler of the Realm. He&#39;s really neat, but I would be lying if I said he doesn&#39;t have issues. Let&#39;s start off with the face print. Underneath his large beard lays another, printed with a different, brighter&nbsp;shade of orange. From what I can tell, this is inaccurate to the character model in the show. He seems happy with his inaccuracy, though, with a slight smile laying inbetween&nbsp;his nearly neon orange&nbsp;beard. As I&#39;ve mentioned before, I really like his hair piece. It&#39;s a nice, natural looking orange with a crown molded onto the top. The piece is not dual-molded; the coronet&nbsp;&nbsp;painted gold. If nobody told me otherwise, I would&#39;ve guessed that LEGO took the former route. It was done that good. His body is gold, with mechanical bits and bobs mixing with the knightly armor&nbsp;and his kingdom&#39;s insignia sitting on his chest. It does what it needs to do, although the gold could&#39;ve been toned down slightly. He also has back printing&nbsp;which, although a nice thing to have, is unneeded with with the inclusion of a cape. His legs continue the printing seen on the torso, as well as keeping the same base color of gold. His aforementioned cape is dark blue, using the matte finished version of the piece. This is kind of an issue, since he&#39;s supposed to sit in his cramped cockpit with it still on. It&#39;s one of the few times where I think the new, thicker cloth cape was necessary.&nbsp;He&#39;s a cool minifigure, but with some minor faults.</p>

<p>Next in line is his companion, the King&#39;s Bot. He&#39;s a little grunt, standing quite a bit shorter than your average minifigure. His face is a metallic silver, with a double-sided head. One represents the binary appearance of the robot, a more stiff, less characterized blank stare. The other shows what happens to the android overtime with a cracked tooth and a grin. I personally prefer the more stern look, but both were well done. The Bot includes an average castle helmet, nothing too different.&nbsp;His Torso is blue, using a printed 1X1 with the King&#39;s insignia to differentiate him from his&nbsp;brethren.&nbsp;An azure version of the piece&nbsp;would&#39;ve worked better since it would&#39;ve matched its shoulders, but it still looks good. His legs are silverfied&nbsp;versions of the Ninjago&nbsp;Skeleton&#39;s, with the usual black boots. He&#39;s probably my favorite minifig in the set, just from its personality.</p>

<p>Finally, we have Flame Thrower, the only non-exclusive minifigure in the set and my personal least favorite. His face print is actually really nice. It&#39;s&nbsp;red and intimidating with scales all over. Included&nbsp;with this is his abnormally yellow eyes that differ from an average minifigure&#39;s. All though I&#39;m not a fan of it normally, it works well here. Flame Thrower also includes printing on the back of his head, &nbsp;but it&#39;s not a new face, but scales. It&#39;s not unheard of, but it&#39;s still a cool touch. My major gripe with the fig stands with his hair. Now I like the Mohawk mold, but I don&#39;t really like it on him. I can&#39;t pin point why, but it just doesn&#39;t seem right. The torso is left bare with no armor. Printed to show his scaly red eight pack. Included with this is his back printing, which is mostly unseen from his arrow back quiver. His legs have fantastic printing, detailed to a tee. It&#39;s just remarkably done. Just to wrap this up, he&#39;s a great minifigure, but lightened down from my own personal taste.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>It was pretty enjoyable to build. I especially liked how the legs came together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, including the [over exaggerated] minutes it took to apply the stickers, the build took a good and fun&nbsp;forty five minutes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Completed&nbsp;Model</h3>

<p>The King&#39;s&nbsp;Mech is&nbsp;muy magn&iacute;fica! A fantastic model that leaves very little for a fan to not enjoy.</p>

<p>It just looks great. With silver and dark blue laid out evenly throughout the mech, it includes trans. orange and blue to make it more fun and not too dark. In fact, I would summarize this model with that one word, fun. It just screams it with the knightly plume standing on top of the visor, a little crank on the back to make it seem like a wound-up toy. &nbsp;It even includes a little spaceship shield to put your little King&#39;s bot in. The legs look really, really good. Filled with mechanical details, it still keeps a semi-regal structure that I love.&nbsp;The cockpit is quite possibly my favorite part. It holds the king well and covers him enough to make it look like a nice protective barrier. There&#39;s also two shoulder covers that make it even more knightly.&nbsp;My only real gripe look-wise is with his plume, which&nbsp;stands a bit too short.</p>

<p>Moving on to its features, this set has many. For one thing, the shield ship can separate from the main model and &quot;fly&quot; around, giving the bot something to do while the king is fighting. It also includes stud-shooters, which helps with its&nbsp;playability. When the ship is gone, we can see a hidden arm gun. It&#39;s a bit lackluster, but a nice touch. On the back of the mech, there&#39;s two clips. These hold the heroes&#39; weapons. Again, a touch that they didn&#39;t even need to add. Speaking of the back, there&#39;s two giant wing-like flaps attached with Mixel joints. They&#39;re pretty stinking cool.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, we get to the crossbow shooter. It keeps with the whole vibe that stands around Flame Thrower. It&#39;s okay, but kind of forgettable next to&nbsp;the mech.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, The King&#39;s Mech is a fantastic set. It does have its faults, but is still a worthy purchase.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The now familiar color scheme for the box art is on full display here. The cover is attractive and highlights what to expect from the build well. Inside you will find one fairly large instruction manual 3 numbered bags (2 are labeled 1) and a sticker sheet with 12 stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set is a treasure trove of Nexo Knights parts. Many of which are very useful, the new sharply sloped pieces in particular are great and you get a good mix of them in 2 or 3 colors. When you are done you will have a pile of good parts left over too.</p>

<p>Of note is a spare printed tile for the King&#39;s bot and King Halbert&#39;s beard piece which is a nice accessory to get for other &nbsp;figures to use. You also get 2 Nexo&nbsp;powers but both are fairly weak compared to many others. Kind of sad for the King but I suppose he knows what he is doing with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[url=https://flic.kr/p/L4zLkF][img]https://c6.staticflickr.com/9/8058/28920235133_44d6de156f.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/L4zLkF]P9082010[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/139708441@N07/]Macster Tome[/url], on Flickr</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The figures in this set like all Nexo Knights figures are simply amazing! The Flame Thrower and bot are not that new but feature the usual prints either side of the head and the Flame Thrower looks cool with his back print for the torso and his mohawk! You can never have enough mohawks!</p>

<p>But the stand out figure is by far King Halbert! He features only a single sided face print but it is awesome. His equipment and cape complete the look. I really love his appearance as&nbsp;he looks much more kingly here in his battle get up than his normal blue garb we mostly see in the animated series.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>In all honesty this is my first time building a Mech with LEGO parts and basically all of the parts and techniques involved to accomplish that are new to me. Unlike the other small to medium sets I have reviewed for this line I was really taken with the build for this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The experience was super fun and as the mech slowly came to life it really felt like I was the one rolling it&nbsp;out of the kingly factory and adoring it with all the necessary tools for combat!&nbsp;</p>

<p>This thing is SUPER FUN to build and is very sturdy once you are done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The smaller build for the Flame Thrower is also decent and makes me wish two were included in this set since they look the part as decent static defense points.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is fantastic it towers over minifigures and even the small emplacement for the Flame Thrower. The mech has a good amount of poses it can twist into and the gear he has on&nbsp;definitely looks amazing! The shoulder guards are slightly hinged and the arms and legs have a good range of motion! This thing is awesome to just look at and makes a fantastic display piece just by itself! The two clips in the back for the king and the bot&#39;s weapons are great. I really cant stop gushing at how awesome this thing is in person and in play.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is thing is amazing. Definitely worth the money just for the joy of seeing it on display. But do not let the esthetics of it fool you. This thing is a full on play model. It has a huge range of motion for something of its size and weight and the figures included are amazing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only minor gripes I have is the lack of a proper left arm. But the rocket shield he has in its place is novel and fun. Though I feel sorry for the bot as he has to apparently get clobbered a bit there. Also the &quot;back side&quot; of the sword is very bland but thankfully the set comes with enough spare parts to really spruce it up! Go trans-orange!</p>

<p>[url=https://flic.kr/p/M1B4hM][img]https://c2.staticflickr.com/9/8121/29542894545_140cdb6dda.jpg[/img][/url][url=https://flic.kr/p/M1B4hM]P9082020[/url] by [url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/139708441@N07/]Macster Tome[/url], on Flickr</p>

<p>The stickers were also not a chore on this set and really accent the build quite well. But do be careful a handful of the 12 are clear-backed. So smudging and fingerprinting them is sadly too easy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now my king must defend the library from Ultimate Lavaria&#39;s legion of doom! Fight on brave Knighton&nbsp;Knights!&nbsp;</p>
