Instead, he became the final Bionicle hero to be produced; with the announcement of the line&#39;s second cancelation coming out nearly a month after this set was released. So what many felt was the sign of thing to come with Ekimu, turned out instead to be one final swansong&nbsp;for the line.</p>

<p>With this being what is likely the last Bionicle hero for the foreseeable future, I decided to go out and buy it with some spare cash I had at hand. Does Ekimu make a fitting end to the storied theme?</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t normally talk about packaging, but I will mention that the 2016 wave of Bionicle sets used the same hexagonal box from the 2015 sets, but with thicker cardboard to prevent the box from being crushed due to rough handling.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The stand out piece in this set is the Mask of Creation casted in transparent blue. This unique masks helps to give this figure an ethereal appearance. The 2016 torso shell is also cast in transparent blue with gold printing, and doesn&#39;t look nearly as garish as it did on some of the figures from earlier this year. The new crystal shell is also included to make up Ekimu&#39;s hammer. A gunmetal and trans-orange Umarak mask is also included with the set.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>One of the strengths of the 2016 Bionicle wave, was the reintroduction of Technic building into the CCBS system. Ekimu&#39;s frame uses the rather new torso beam with a Technic structure built around it to mount the 2015 gearbox onto his back. Most of the build is straight forward, with very little surprises for seasoned CCBS builders.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>Ekimu looks great as a finished model. When early photos of Ekimu were released, I feared the transparent blue used through-out would be garish; but in person it balances well. Particularly the transparent colors look great in bright light.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two play features are a fun addition to the model. The waist swivel works well; the arm swivel though has a lot of friction on it due to the construction used; making the function a bit stiff. The weapons of the model are a throwback to Ekimu&#39;s form from last year; with a large hammer and a saw shield. The hammer is large enough it does feel a little awkward to move around, but it looks great as a display piece. The saw shield is designed to be easily replaced with the polybag&nbsp;BIO601602-1 Ekimu Falcon; which sadly saw only a limited release in some European countries.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, I feel this is a very solid Bionicle figure. At the base price of $15 USD; it feels like a quality purchase. While it is sad that this is the final Bionicle hero set; it marks &nbsp;a great way to end the series.</p>

"Cjhpkns","2016-12-29T21:17:24.783Z","Good set, great after some mods to the design","<p>In my opinion, Ekimu the best representation of Gen. 2. He has perfected &nbsp;(for the most part) the gear feature introduced with the Masters. He also incorporates the Uniter&#39;s waist feature, adding more posing&nbsp;to the figure. The build was enjoyable, while nothing impressive. Nonetheless,&nbsp;I appreciated&nbsp;the way that&nbsp;both gear features were merged. It looks good.&nbsp;The extra mask included is nice, and I found it can be placed on his hip.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a figure, he looks good, but he is quite shorter than I expected, actually closer to Gali Uniter&#39;s height. However, one major con is that when you use the hammer gear function, the hammer is too heavy.&nbsp;His color scheme is very nice, with trans blue being his primary color, and featuring gold accents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;MODS-</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I decided to go ahead and edit the figure so that he would look better, and work better:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I switched out the trans blue bone&nbsp;pieces that were his lower legs, and replaced them with the bone piece&nbsp;with two extra pin holes, which I also had in trans blue (Kopaka).</li>
	<li>I replaced the gray upper bone piece with a light blue bone piece, like the one on his other arm, so as to add articulation to the arm with the hammer.</li>
	<li>I added friction adders to both arms at the shoulder joint.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the end, he was taller and&nbsp;his arms were slightly longer (and had more friction in the shoulder), which gave the figure an improved stature and presence, per se. It also allowed for more movement in his ankle, as the armor was previously blocking most foot movement when posing.</p>

<p>FINAL NOTE</p>

<p>Overall, a good figure. He is a good representation of what Bionicle Gen. 2 accomplished, getting stable waist and arm gear functions, while keeping the look intact.&nbsp;</p>
