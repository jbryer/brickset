<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong>The construction is fun in a few places. &nbsp;The legs are different from the this and last years Toa. &nbsp;The set also comes with hands with separate fingers. &nbsp;The head &amp; jaw is as distracting as the other villains. &nbsp;Primarily because Lego went with a transparent neon green instead of a trans red fitting with the rest of the color scheme. &nbsp;A potential deal breaker is the wrist blades which look clunky and needlessly bulky.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Parts: </strong>Parts of interest to MOCers include a lot of transparent red parts like bones and ribs. &nbsp;The chest piece is a highlight. I&#39;m a little surprised it hasn&#39;t found its way into a Nexo Knight set. If the set had a transparent red skull piece it would be worth buying for that alone. Another piece for MOCers is the transparent black rock shells. They especially work with the trans red to give a smoky, smoldering look. The beast head is the same mold found in Quake Beast and Storm Beast. &nbsp;The black and red is really the best version of that piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Fun:</strong> It is fun to build, but the play value once it is assembled is limited. &nbsp;The wrist blades are a pain to reposition every time you want to strike a pose. &nbsp;I just took them off and gave Lava Beast a different weapon. &nbsp;The fingers are a lot of fun to work.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Verdict: </strong>Overall, this is a good set for the price. It&#39;s like a base model to the other villain set. The trans red and black color scheme really sel it. &nbsp;This wouldn&#39;t look too out of place with Rock Raiders or Nexo Knights sets. &nbsp;For builders who like to create their own sets, there is a good mix of parts in black, gunmetal gray and transparent red.&nbsp;</p>
