"Square","2016-06-04T23:22:26.857Z","Puppet Beast","<p><strong>71314 Storm Beast</strong> Is one of &quot;many&quot; horde Beast in the 2016 Bionicle villain wave summoned by Umarak, this creature is somewhat a hybrid of water, ice and electric judging from the &quot;mini-comic&quot; from the back of the box. Also to note that it&#39;s consider to be a store exclusive from Toys R&#39; Us.</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></h3>

<p>The box the same cardboard material as all the other 2016 Bionicle sets. The booklet request 51 step of building <em>(Pg.3-38). </em></p>

<h3><strong>New Parts/Recolor:</strong></h3>

<p>The set contain 3 new parts and 5 new recolor and a printed chestplate.</p>

<p><!--StartFragment-->The claw and head uses transparent fluorescent green and the same goes partially on both mask; <!--EndFragment-->Storm Beast mask is the same mold as all the beast share with a rugged asymmetrical mess similar to <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/71310-1/Umarak-the-Hunter"">71310: Umarak the Hunter</a>. <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/71311-1/Kopaka-and-Melum-Unity-set"">71311: <!--StartFragment-->Kopaka Unity</a> mask looks unhealthy and the blend of white make it &quot;unique.&quot; <!--EndFragment--><!--StartFragment--></p>

<p><!--EndFragment-->The new crystal armor in transparent bright blue only have connection for ball joint and I can see some potential for mocing.</p>

<p>The 4-long shell is the only earth blue piece (beside the mask) on this entire set.</p>

<p>The chestplate tries to represent the crystal stack and I think it translate ok.</p>

<p>Last the jaw piece is in gunmetal, I can&#39;t really say anything good on this and I would go to the con later in this review.</p>

<h3><strong>The Build:</strong></h3>

<p>The build is slightly complex from the hand(arm?) and leg with technic pieces. The back build is what make this set interesting and unique compare to all the other beasts; its arm and tail are connected to a bar that move depending what direction you move the tail.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></h3>

<p>Storm Beast appears very bland as a build but with very light and dark colors scheme, the function what make this diverse. Like I mention in the build, the tail can move the arm simultaneously; the function take time to get used to and can make posing difficult to some. Also to note the shadow trap on the tip of the tail help weigh it down to keep the arm up.</p>

<p>The arm is a lengthy mess, the hand have expose ball socket on the &quot;risk&quot; and have no proper elbow. This is probability intentional from the set designer to keep the arm light weighted but I believe they could of done a better job. All the villain from this wave can pose their clawed finger but Storm Beast can swivel his thumb.</p>

<p>The head attachment is badly executed, I wish they used a ccbs bone to freely move but they instead used a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4560108"">4560108: Beam 2 With Ball</a> (Glatorian Neck) that limit movement. The mouth is gappy and can&#39;t close, attempting it would pop the mask out which is a problem in all the.<!--StartFragment--></p>

<h3><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong></h3>

<p><strong>Pros: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Great color scheme</li>
	<li>A pretty fun and unique function</li>
	<li>Contain a decent amount of parts</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons: </strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Arm feels incomplete</li>
	<li>Jaw can&#39;t close</li>
	<li>Posing can be hard for some</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp; Overall, Storm Beast is probably the best character in this wave in terms of functions, I recommend getting him for any constraction fan to feel the complex gimmick.</p>
