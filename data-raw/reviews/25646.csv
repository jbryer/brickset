It definitely caught my attention as the best looking of the models that were a part of the promotion.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is typical for its kind. Displays the model in an action pose on the front, gives the name, etc. Back has a few highlights of the play features, and&nbsp;small text-less&nbsp;comic giving a&nbsp;back-story, as well as displaying a mix-and-mash character that can be built by combining this model with sets 71313-73136. The instructions seemed longer than they should have been, and contained the same information as the back of the box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I feel like some parts of the model were unnecessary, notably&nbsp;the two large&nbsp;bear-trap jaws. However, the set does have a few exclusive parts (no new&nbsp;moulds I don&#39;t think), such as Quake Beast&#39;s mask, Onua&#39;s mask, and the printed breastplate.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It took me about twenty minutes to build the model, I didn&#39;t have any issues with building, except for the part where I had to attach the bear-trap jaws to the Quake Beast&#39;s left shoulder. The instructions didn&#39;t do a great job showing what part had to be attached to the shoulder, and the perspective should have been changed, in my opinion. Another issue was the manner in which the Quake Beast&#39;s actual jaw pops his mask off. This particular play feature is meant for the mask to pop off when he is &quot;punched&quot; by any enemy, however, in actuality, the jaw has to be pulled forward, rather than be pushed back, which honestly seems lazy to me. There is probably enough empty space in the head-and-neck area to actually implement such a mechanism.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>71315 suffers from having too many play features. The right side of the model is much heavier than the left, and attempting to stand up the Quake Beast was a bit difficult as he leaned to one side. The crank which moves his bashing fist forward and backward is just terrible. The arm is pretty much inarticulate. The mechanism really serves no purpose as it doesn&#39;t do anything &#39;cool&#39; - it just moves the arm. It&#39;s painfully obvious that the designers were just trying to add extra parts in to raise the price. The bear-trap jaw is also unnecessary, and although its does serve a purpose (to hold one of the protagonists&#39; masks), it just looks bad in the final build. Quake Beast&#39;s arms and legs are also very inarticulate in general - they are <em>designed</em> to limit how to degree to which his&nbsp;joints can move, which is, in my opinion,&nbsp;just a terrible idea overall.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Like said, 71315 suffers from an excess amount of play features, and&nbsp;is a stiff,&nbsp;inarticulate, and unbalanced&nbsp;model. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this set.</p>
