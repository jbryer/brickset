His upgraded form, Umarak the Destroyer, is not any of these things. (I&#39;ll call them UTH and UTD for time&#39;s sake.)</p>

<p>This set is trying too hard to harken back to the Bionicle Titans of old. There were large, well made sets like Brutaka and Axonn that were well loved by the fans. UTD is so focused on being like those sets, what with the Technic legs and the function-based arms, that it fails to realize it could be its own thing with the new elements of the time very well.</p>

<p>This set comes in a large cardboard hexagon like many of the other Bionicle reboot sets. The model itself is only a tiny bit taller than the box, so it is easy to judge whether or not you want it.</p>

<p>There are some great pieces. Lots of good Technic bits, a healthy portion of trans lime green, the all-trans-green head, and of course the collectible Mask of Control. If you are looking for a parts pack this is actually a good buy. It represents all of the newness of Bionicle&#39;s reboot in one set.</p>

<p>The build is fine. It is a bit more involved compared to the other Bionicle sets which is very welcome. There are functions in the torso and both arms which must be rigged carefully.</p>

<p>The completed model I am not at all a fan of. It is clearly trying to be an organic, tortured monster but it fails horribly. There are so many exposed Technic pieces that do not mesh well with what the trans lime green is trying to convey.The chest detail is pretty cool but unfortunately it is a pair of stickers.</p>

<p>The massive claws have a gear-operated opening and closing function, which is actually pretty cool, but again it&nbsp; sticks out like a sore thumb. The torso also has a knob on the lower back, allowing the whole waist to pivot left and right. Again, cool feature, but somewhat unnecessary and awkward.</p>

<p>The worst part by far is the neck. It is a large, ugly, unmasked collection of Technic beams. It looks awful from the side and top. Only a straight-on or low angle view can save the set&#39;s appearance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is an okay set. It is sturdy and fun to play with. However, it tries to mix a cool aesthetic with a cool building style and the two just don&#39;t mix. Buying this as a display piece or for the cool factor just isn&#39;t worth it. I would recommend it in the parts pack or action figure sense, though. And, of course, the Legendary Mask is essential if you are a Bionicle collector.</p>
