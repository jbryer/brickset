<p>This is a Lego star wars magazine weapon rack so you already know it&#39;s not great .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build is on a nice 6&times;6 radar dish style piece and has some more basic bricks and colour onto but there is a great 2&times;2 trans red brick the best thing in the set . The Accessories include two lightsabers one blue one been a regular blaster and a longer rifle .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>if you like weapon racks then good for you get this you&#39;ll love it but if you like me and don&#39;t then building it should not be a priority just part it out its not that interesting .&nbsp;</p>
