"roostercogburn","2016-03-02T08:22:07.05Z","""They look like ants from up here!""","<p>So this is big&#39;un&nbsp;for this series of MCU Lego sets this year, and on the surface, I thought it looked like a bit of a mess. I&#39;m a completionist, so I was destined to buy it anyway, but while my first impressions weren&#39;t wonderful, due to a few elements, this set definitely has grown on me. Yes. that was a pun. For those of you who didn&#39;t skip ahead, it&#39;s big Ant-Man.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box depicts an action scene at, surprise, an airport with the various super heroes at each others&#39; throats. The back of the box shows the various play features as well.</p>

<p>We get a comic depicting the events leading up to the showdown at the airport, which of course includes the two other sets released with the launch. Spoilers may occur.<br />
<br />
The instructions are fine, although I did have a small problem distinguishing black from dark blue in the latter sections of the of the booklet, but luckily there wasn&#39;t a lot of overlap.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A lot of sloped blue parts, a transblue&nbsp;windshield and the lower cockpit section that have been tokens of the Quinjet are included. Also, the inverted high window pieces and large, white wall sections of the tower are some other standouts, along with six fence pieces. The yellow baggage cart also has an old school four stud wide chassis used in older town cars. That was an expected blast from the past!</p>

<p>Aside from the myriad&nbsp;of black, grey, white and blue pieces, we also get a two stud high curved cylinder piece with Paul Rudd&#39;s visage plastered on it, so that makes it a must have for MOCers too!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Iron Man - The details on Iron Man have been updated from the Avengers 2 version, but it&#39;s the same old minifigure plan. Helmet with lifting&nbsp;faceplate, blue studs on his hands for stabilizers, small transparent columns for his thrusters, the only big differences comes from his &quot;weapon&quot;, a lightsaber blade and small satellite&nbsp;dish meant to be a blast from his thruster. A neat&nbsp;addition, but I&#39;m positive I&#39;ve seen it MOC&#39;d. His faces are the usual smug/cocky and focused/angry.</p>

<p>War Machine - This version is brand new. The black accents make him look more...aggressive. Also, his printing are different then the new Iron Man pallet swap, and I think looks better then the original in every way. He has the same smug/angry face combo though.&nbsp;The other details that have been updated are the way his blaster (now a stud shooter instead of a clip and lightsaber&nbsp;handle!), as well as an antenna of some kind on his back. The comic shows him holding it menacingly as a weapon...so did they give a guy with a robot suit a club? Now I&#39;m hooked.</p>

<p>Captain America - This version looks very similar previous versions, especially the Age of Ultron and Helicarrier versions. Same formula as always, one&nbsp;sided printed head, printed torso to look like his WW1 costume, oddly one tone legs,&nbsp;and his token shield, which compared to his more dulled colour scheme (compared to the cartoon version released earlier this year) seems to stand out. It&#39;s not a good way or a bad way, it just stands out.</p>

<p>Winter Soldier - So for those of you that missed the polybag version that came out two years ago (how time flies!), this is one of the first two sets to have him included. The other version has an SMG, where this version has double blaster, but otherwise seem identical. His double print head features two new faces, stubbly smirk or stubbly angry. His arm is printed with more detail too, and definitely seems like a better fit in the MCU style sets.</p>

<p>Agent 13 - A brand new figure, and a prominent woman in the movie it seems to boot! Her hair is like a longer Bilbo Baggins hair piece, she&#39;s got a cute smirk/focused face set, and has a black torso printed almost like that of Nick Fury from the Helicarrier set, with plain grey pants. She also has a SMG, perhaps stolen from Winter Soldier from the Crossbones set. A solid addition.</p>

<p>Scarlett Witch - Along with Agent 13 and Black Widow (surprisingly separated from the Quinjet this launch!), she is one of an increasing number of female co-stars to get a Lego minifigure. This version has the same head and very similar torso (if not the same) as the Hulkbuster set from last year, but this version has a cloth skirt, because let&#39;s face it, it&#39;s not a super hero set without a cap or skirt or some cloth element! Her hair is brand new to me, and flows back and over both shoulders at equal lengths. Her accessories are magic disks (?) made from transpink studs and satellite&nbsp;dish pieces.</p>

<p>Ant Man - Micro figure! The same scale as tiny little SHIELD soldiers from the Helicarrier, and the detail is great on this guy. I got two for some reason, so I feel pretty stoked on that. He is also a brick built figure I will go into detail on as part of the build.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was broken down into 5 bags, all with either one or two smaller bags, and it simplified things.</p>

<p>The first bag was the baggage cart&nbsp;and the lower half of the tower. The handler was pretty straight forward, the basic concept is probably super familiar to old school Town/Space fans, and the exploding luggage play feature didn&#39;t take anything away from the display value. The tower was pretty straight forward, although I definitely thought I missed a step looking at the gap on the second floor.<br />
<br />
That was solved pretty quickly in booklet two, which completed the wall, which breaks away during the fight presumably. It also finished a play feature which seems a little big for what it does: The exploding boxes. It&#39;s not a bad feature, and it doesn&#39;t take anything away from the model, but it seems very big for fairly little reward. Also, without having seen the movie, so far into the build it seems like the heroes of this little tale have the aim of storm troopers. I don&#39;t know, either that or everything at an airport explodes in this universe.</p>

<p>The third bag was my favorite: Mega-Ant-Man! Made mostly from angled bricks, two technic pins hold his legs together, and the smaller ball joints keep his technic piece hands together. His head uses some SNOT techniques, and is the most authentic part of the figure. Everything is to scale, his hands can hold a regular minifigure, and the range of the motion is similar enough to minifigures to recreate poses you can make with his smaller counterpart from the Ant Man set do. I can&#39;t stress how neat I think this part of the set is. On the down side, this section has a lot of stickers, and unlike so far into the build, these add details that, if are skipped, leave it looking plain. Also, spoilers, maybe? I know there was an uproar when the box of the Iron Man 3 helicopter attack set showed Pepper in the Iron Man armour, so points off?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bags 4 and 5 are used to build a miniature version of the Quinjet. The previous two iterations of the Quinjet&nbsp;were in and of themselves&nbsp;a large set, and if I am to be honest, I like this scale better. The build is pretty straight forward, starting at the cockpit, then the lower frame, and the bag split happens between the two wings. It is a pretty simple build, but as I said, perhaps due to lighting, or darker ink used for the dark blue, but I did find myself looking for a black piece when it was a blue, and vice versa. The small size is an asset here, as it makes it more swooshable, and would be easier for a kid to play with, which seems to be the main target for the set.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is definitely a play set as opposed to the usual display pieces we see at this price point. That doesn&#39;t bother me at all, as it still a cohesive set, and includes a &quot;base&quot; and two &quot;vehicles&quot;. The minifigure selection is great and compliments the narrative that this set and&nbsp;even the movie are hinting at. My favorite part of the completed set is giant Ant Man/Goliath, which just seems so original in terms of modern Lego, that it almost overshadows the other elements.</p>

<p>The minifigures are the other reason this set stands out, as we get new versions of Winter Soldier and War Machine, and updated versions of Scarlett Witch, Captain America and Iron Man, and a brand new Sharon Carter, in addition to the mega and micro versions of Ant Man I won&#39;t shut up about.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;d be a swell set if it were an airport theme, with the control tower and some kind of weird luxury jet, but the super hero theme means it will have a good selection of minifigures at this price point. Six minifigures, one (in my case two) micro figures and a brick built 5 inch figure made this one stand out to me though.The tower is nothing special, but adds back ground and play features to the battle. The giant Ant Man figure is great, that&#39;s covered. The Quinjet variation I like a lot as well, as it doesn&#39;t have to dominate the set as the previous ones had. The seeming odds and ends do add together to make a set that would have gotten my attention if I was younger and looking to play with it, but as an AFOL, it seems harder then other sets to display easily.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d say its a great set, but being Canadian...it cost me $100. I don&#39;t know if that would be up, or down, or about the same in the U.S. or Europe, but it did seem small at this price. On the other hand, I got the last one from my local Lego Store (shout out to Guildford!), so it must be proving popular in&nbsp;spite of the price. I&#39;d say buy it for a gift for a KFOL to play, or buy it for the minifigures, or even for Mega-Rudd (I found one that stuck!), but be prepared for most of the value to come from those three elements to me. That doesn&#39;t make it a bad set, just it may not appeal to everyone.</p>

"weirdbricks","2016-03-12T12:57:29.743Z","Hands in the air iron man!","<p>What a excellent set! This set is just so good!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is quite small compared to what you get! On the front the box shows that the &#39;quinjet&#39; is attacking&nbsp;iron man and war machine.&nbsp;In the back off the box it shows all the play features, and a small cartoon what says: &quot;comic book included&quot;. The instruction in this set is really small and thick, you only get 1 instruction in a 850 pieces set!(not very often). It also include a small comic book.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A great and huge selection of parts in this set. Ant mans mouth is a printed piece, you also get a mini ant man that has a really good print on it! You also get a great sticker sheet with around 20 stickers. It is &quot;some&quot; big parts in this set but many of them are normal parts, except minifigure parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Super selection of minifigures! You&#39;re getting 6 normal figures, one brick built figure and one mini at man with the size off a &#39;round brick&#39;. The figures are: captain america, Bucky Barnes(winter soldier), agent 13, mini ant man and big ant man, Scarlett witch and iron man and war machine. Bucky Barnes has a new and excellent looking torso&nbsp;as i think is super awesome! I think lego did a phenomenal job with the figures!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build tok me around 3-4 hours and was just like normal builds!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model off this set looks just fantastic! My favorite part of the set is the &#39;quinjet&#39; this thing looks just so good, it also has a nice mechanism who lets the plane shoot, the other cool think about the quinjet is that it is a bit smaller than the last one but still got alot more in to it; you can put 3 figures on the plane.The little yellow luggage car&nbsp;can shoot luggage in the air: by pushing a button back on the car! The control tower looks more finished than the other control towers that lego have done, it can also shhot some more luggage;-) In total a excellent set!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Out off words! So good.</p>

"A_Brickset_user","2016-08-05T20:46:53.7Z","""Has Anyone Seen That Really Old Movie, The Empire Strikes Back?""","<p>I bought this set immediately after seeing Civil War in late April, and is quite something. Few sets manage to nail the balance between great figs, a fun build, and a satisfying end product, but this one ticks all the boxes.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Box is the usual size for &pound;70 set, and the instructions come in a nice perfect bound booklet, as is the practice for larger sets these days.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The only particularly interesting part is the new 2x4x2&nbsp;windshield-thingy used for Giant-Man&#39;s helmet. I look forward to seeing other applications for it in the future.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is where it gets good. I&#39;ll do this by team, starting with Iron Man&#39;s squad (the best, in my humble opinion)</p>

<p>Iron Man Mk46 - I am an avid collector of Iron....... Men? and this suit is easily one of the finest yet. It&#39;s certainly movie accurate and has printing galore. I won&#39;t bore you with an in-depth breakdown, because you&#39;re probably bored of Iron Man printing analysis by now.</p>

<p>War Machine - Wahey! They finally got the right suit in the right movie! Also stunning, though I would recommend swapping the face for the old Rhodey one, and maybe changing the stick clip for a smaller gun like on the older suits.</p>

<p>Team Cap (Booooo!)</p>

<p>Cap himself: Same as usual. Nice torso, nice head, print legs, make shield darker, blah blah blah.</p>

<p>Bucky/Winter Soldier: Pretty good. Torso printing is ace, and is very easily transferable to other spy-type dudes - I used mine for a Bobbi Morse - but the legs could use some printing. His arm has been through some serious stuff since his really rare,&nbsp;then kinda rare, then common as muck polybag appearance last year, and now looks suitably worn, which is accurate to the movie. His hair is on point, but it&#39;s gave I have the biggest issue with - I didn&#39;t know Chris Pratt played Bucky. I don&#39;t mind re-using faces (Though Gandalf for Pym? Unacceptable) but my problem is two people who co-exist in the same universe having the same face. I think for this reason, Bucky should have gotten a new face print.</p>

<p>Scarlet Witch: And the award for most improved player goes to..... Wanda has seen some serious changes both in movie form and in Lego, but they&#39;re both similar, which is good. Her hair is now accurate, her torso printing is great, her powers actually look like...... her powers, and the skirt really tops it off.</p>

<p>Micro Ant-Man: To quote Hope Van Dyne: it&#39;s about damn time. A great little fig&nbsp;all round, with accurate printing. And they give you two, so you can stick one in your Ant-Man set! I&#39;ll get to his BIG brother in a bit.</p>

<p>Last and, let&#39;s not kid ourselves here, least - Agent 13/Sharon Carter/To-paraphrase-Quicksilver-who-didn&#39;t-see-that-one-coming?: I guess she&#39;s pretty accurate or whatever, but I didn&#39;t really enjoy her character, and I feel the same way about the fig. The jacket print&#39;s pretty nice, so do the smart thing and use it for an accurate Black Widow instead.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fun fun fun. You start off with the usual miscellanies; this time it&#39;s a (surprisingly versatile) luggage cart. It explodes, and you can put Ant-Man in below. The suitcases have stickers from Billund, Sokovia and Wakanda. Then you do the tower. Also fun. More explosion features. And it houses the (sacred?) fire extinguisher. Then you should do Giant-Man, but I strongly recommend saving him for the end, because he&#39;s brilliant. Not brilliant? The&nbsp;Quinjet. It&#39;s an okay build, but it&#39;s easily the most&nbsp;boring part overall. Giant-Man. Oh yeah. This is why you buy the set. Great fun to build, great fun to play with, and an homage to genius.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Outstanding. I cannot describe with words how good it all looks together. Giant-Man is a serious achievement in terms of modelling figures, and the tower is easily on par, if not better than, the average City control tower. The Quinjet is something of a disappointment, and I must confess mine is currently on eBay, having been swapped out for the (more movie-accurate, on top of other things) 2015 version. There are also a lot of Easter eggs. On top of the aforementioned suitcases, there is also a cool sign saying &quot;authorised minifigures only&quot; on the tower door, and those boxes (which can be blown away by Ant-Man) have Stark Industries, Hanmer, and AIM on the top of them.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Buy this set. Even if you&#39;re not too fussed about having complete teams, or even if you&#39;re not even a minifig person, but this set. The figs are great, the models are great, even the price is reasonable. And if you are looking for&nbsp;more,&nbsp;76067&nbsp;Tanker Truck Takedown is the perfect add-on, not just for rounding out the teams (though it does&nbsp;leave&nbsp;you with only three gaps in the team line-ups), but as well as being a great set in in its own&nbsp;right, it will enhance your experience with this set as well. Even on its own, however 76051 will probably always be remembered as one of the finest superhero sets of this era. Just buy this set.</p>

"TK_1308","2016-07-02T14:35:38.653Z","""What do we do?"" ""We fight!""","<p>The largest set in the current Captain America: Civil War range brings a great range of characters to the Lego MCU and some nice set pieces for the Super Heroes collection.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The usual large scale rectangular box for kits in this price range. Iron man is the figure of choice with a battle scene of all the mini and micro figures next to him. The front shows all the kit recreating the airport battle scene. The back has more of the battle scene with several panels showing the play features of the Quinjet, control tower and figures.<br />
There is one square solid spine instruction manual and the usual comic book as well.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A good number of parts for a kit of this size with a nice mix of colours present. Some nice new pieces for me as well in the set, especially the grey 2x2 tile half wings.<br />
There are 3 bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains the lower half of the control tower, the baggage truck, Iron Man and Agent 13.<br />
Bag 2 contains the upper half of the control tower, the gate, Scarlet Witch and Ant-Man microfigure.<br />
Bag 3 contains Captain America and our first giant minifigure Giant Man.<br />
Bag 4 contains the main body and port wing of the Quinjet along with the Winter Soldier.<br />
Bag 5 contains the upper hull and starboard wing of the Quinjet along with War Machine.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with a rather pleasing 6 minifigures, a microfigure and a giant figure.<br />
Iron Man comes with the usual great details printed on the torso and legs. He has the standard double sided Tony Stark head with the smiling / angry faces. As well as the standard blue repulsar effects, he also has a repulsar blast and disc effect for his hand.<br />
War Machine is excellent and has even more detailing than Iron Man. This is far superior to the 2013 version in every way. He has the standard red repulsar effects, a stud shooter for the left shoulder and a staff weapon on the right. Rhodey&#39;s head is double sided with smiling / angry faces.<br />
Captain America is probably the weakest of the minifigures and comes equipped with his trusty shield. Nice torso printing front and back and on the head piece.<br />
The Winter Soldier is great, especially if you didn&#39;t get the polybag version. The detailing on his body is well done, particularly on the left arm. His head is double sided with smiling / angry faces and he comes armed with the usual double barrelled pistol.<br />
Scarlet Witch is excellent, and much better than the 2015 version. The torso printing is great and the dark red coat tails are well done as a cloth piece, much like a Snowtrooper&#39;s. She has two pink clear discs for her hands to simulate her powers. Her head is double sided with smiling / power wielding faces.<br />
Agent 13, Sharon Carter, makes her first appearance as a minifigure. The S.H.I.E.L.D. Tactical top she wears is nicely done. Her head is double sided with smiling / concerned faces and she&#39;s armed with a black pistol.<br />
Next we have the microfigure of Ant-Man. A nice little figure and stands well alongside the other versions of Scott we have so far.<br />
Finally we get to our first giant figure, Giant Man. Most of the detailing for this is done with stickers but the figure looks great. Having kept the design to simulate a big minifigure, he has the same range of movement with hips, head, shoulders and hands, although the last two are more mobile than his smaller counterparts. You can even flip down the mouthpiece to see his face.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 75 minutes.<br />
There are four builds in this kit and none are particularly challenging but are still fun to put together.<br />
The Control Tower is a nice set piece with lots of pay features and design elements to add detailing.<br />
The baggage truck is quite basic, but again has added features to add to the battle scene to be played out.<br />
Giant Man makes good use of Technic pieces, hinges and ball joints to create a highly poseable giant minifigure. Nicely put together although it&#39;s a shame there&#39;s no detailing on his back. He stands a good 14 cm tall.<br />
Finally, the Quinjet is a scaled down version of the 2015 Age Of Ultron release, solidly built with several play features.<br />
The designer has tried to incorporate a lot of playability in this set and it comes across very well, without compromising too much on the build, design or detail.<br />
Yes there are stickers, 26 to be precise, but they do add to the set. I like the novelty labels for the parcels with Stark Industries, A.I.M and Hammer Industries on the top. The ones on the suitcases for Wakanda and Sokovia are also a nice touch. Strangely enough, the piece with Giant Man&#39;s eyes are printed and not a sticker.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Control Tower is one of the nice set pieces in this range. It features a moveable gate, opening door, tool rack (with the ever popular red fire extinguisher!) and rotating radar dishes and bars. The second floor control room with computer, mug and exploding front wall which bursts out in 2 sections. The upper control booth has a &nbsp;swivelling chair, controls and computer screens. There are three parcels which sit on the loading dock. By pushing Ant-Man into a hole in the back, the parcels burst forward. This is okay but I can see the Ant-Man microfigure being easily damaged when doing this. The tower measures 21 cm long (with gate extended), 8 cm wide and 27.5 cm tall (to top of antenna).<br />
The Baggage cart features opening doors, 2 light sticks and a trailer with 3 suitcases on it. There is a tip plate mechanism in the trailer so you can catapult the luggage everywhere. It measures 15 cm long, 3 cm wide and 4.5 cm tall.<br />
Finally the Quinjet. A nice compact fighter craft version of the iconic plane, this dark blue craft has both its charms and its drawbacks. It&#39;s a very solid plane, very flyable ad great for kids. By turning the wheel cog on the top, the gun arm swings out from underneath to deploy the dual stud launchers. The wing tips have double joints and can fold up for landing mode. The opening cockpit seats 2 figures.<br />
However, there are a couple of flaws in the design. The rear door opens and has an attached linked rope but if a figure used it to enter the plane, there&#39;s nowhere to put it as the hold is taken up with the cannon. It seems an unusual feature and just a plain aft hull would&#39;ve sufficed. I was excited to finally see a dual seat cockpit but the design leaves a little to be desired. The pilot&#39;s seat is too high and the figure has to lean back until almost laying down to fit inside. This also means they knock heads with the person sitting in the second seat. Removal of a couple of pieces solves this issue, but it&#39;s strange the designer didn&#39;t think of this before release.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you buy one Civil War set this year, make it this one. It has a great selection of very detailed figures, set pieces, a jet and Giant Man. The set is packed with play features and makes a welcome addition to any collection. For those who love Ant-Man, you now have all three versions of Scott and with the exception of the Quinjet flaws, this is one of the best Marvel sets Lego have made to date. With the Tanker Truck Takedown set coming out later this year, the rest of the Airport Battle scene and characters will make this almost complete.</p>

"Built_It_Better","2016-03-15T02:39:41.477Z","Exemplifies the Best (and Worst) of Super Hero Sets","<p>First things first: This is a fantastic super hero set. Everything people love about super here sets is here, and is fantastic. At the same time, this is a super hero set, so keep that in mind when reading this review and deciding if this is a good set for you.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box follows the comic book caption style that is expected now with super hero sets.</p>

<p>Instructions are clear and get the job done, although I do wish that with sets this size they included cardboard packaged with the booklet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Useful pieces are included here. There aren&#39;t many standout pieces, but Giant Man&#39;s face is printed and that&#39;s just really cool. I also like the cockpit canopy of the Quinjet.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Lots of people buy super hero sets just for the minifigures, and if you&#39;re one of those people this set will not disappoint. You get Iron Man, War Machine, Scarlet Witch, Agent 13, Captain America, Winter Soldier, two Ant-Man microfigures, and one buildable Giant Man. Both sides of the Civil War are well represented here, so it&#39;s nice that the largest set gives you enough to reenact scenes from the movie. All of the figures are good, but most are not exclusive to this set, so you might either have them or can get them in cheaper sets.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is very simple. Nothing too complicated. That being said, building the Giant Man was one of the most enjoyable builds I&#39;ve experienced in quite some time. It&#39;s just so cool to build a giant version of a minifigure. Between Giant Man, the airport tower, and the Quinjet, the build was varied and enjoyable throughout.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I like every part of this set individually, but combined the set is disjointed. I like this version of the Quinjet. It&#39;s smaller, but I love the deep blue color and the shaping is excellent. You can fit two minifigures in the cockpit and store one in the back. Turning a nob on top of the ship lowers two stud shooters on the bottom. A neat feature but I don&#39;t like the look of the nob. You can also open the back door and swing out a rope with a minifigure attached. I think this is a great play feature and doesn&#39;t detract from the build or display value of the ship.</p>

<p>The airport tower is small for being the main build, but I like what&#39;s here. The bottom floor has a wrench and fire extinguisher, plus an area where you can slide the Ant-man microfigure to activate an &quot;exploding&quot; crate feature on the other side of the wall. This play feature doesn&#39;t really work for me. It&#39;s awkward and difficult to apply enough force to actually make the boxes &quot;explode&quot;. The second and third stories have the usual cabinets, rotating chair, and computer screens. The second floor also has an exploding wall feature that is activated by turning a simple technic piece that pushes the wall out in two sections. It works well and doesn&#39;t sacrifice the look of the tower.&nbsp;There&#39;s an attached gate to the tower but it looks incomplete with nothing attached to the other side. I like what&#39;s here, but it doesn&#39;t feel complete. It actually reminds me a lot of the tower in the Hydra Fortress Smash set.</p>

<p>The Giant Man feature is without a doubt the highlight of the set. While there are stickers to apply to the front of the figure, they are easy to align and really add a vital level of detail to the figure. As far as I&#39;m concerned, this build is perfect. It articulates where it should, is accurate to the design of normal sized minifigures, and just looks really, really cool. My only minor complaint is that it is completely bare in the back, but since the front is so cool it doesn&#39;t matter to me.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a small vehicle build with a luggage carrier. This looks fine, and there&#39;s a play feature to &quot;explode&quot; the luggage. However, I don&#39;t think this is something that should have been included in this set. It just seems like a waste of parts to me, considering the build just isn&#39;t very interesting. Why would super heroes use this piece of equipment in the first place? I just don&#39;t get this vehicle&#39;s inclusion in this set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The only thing I don&#39;t like in this set is the small yellow vehicle. Everything else is very good. But combined, this set lacks cohesion and the main build leaves a bit to be desired. This is a common complaint of super hero sets. The builds themselves are often second fiddle to the minifigures. I don&#39;t really expect amazing builds with these sets, but the growing trend in sets looking incomplete (for example, the airport tower with a gate that doesn&#39;t connect to anything) concerns me. The price per piece ratio here is good, but looking at this set as a whole, there seems to be something lacking. Personally, I think the yellow truck should have been axed, and while I really like this version of the Quinjet, we&#39;ve already gotten several versions before. On the whole, I like the individual parts of this set, especially Giant Man, but combined this set leaves a bit to be desired for me. It lacks cohesion. Still, that Giant Man build is great and definitely worthy of display (and maybe worth buying the set for).</p>

"IJS07","2016-07-04T19:25:19.323Z","One Of The Best","<p>When I first saw this set in December, I immediately decided I wanted to save my money to buy it. It felt like forever but it finally was released and I bought it along with the other two civil war sets. But was it worth it? Lets find out.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong> The box is just your average $80.00&nbsp;set box. The dimensions of the box are&nbsp;&nbsp;54 x 28.2 x 7.8 cm. There are 5 bags and one thick instruction&nbsp;manual&nbsp;which is inside another smaller bag with the stickers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;There are&nbsp;807 pieces in this set and the price per piece is 9.9 cents. Among the many unique pieces, my personal favorite&nbsp;is&nbsp;the face piece used on giant man which is printed.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures: There is a total of 6 minifigures.&nbsp;(8 if you count giant man and micro ant man). Each of these is splendid and have a good amount of printing.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Captain America: This is the same Captain America that comes in most other avengers sets. ( I now have 4). The printing on the torso is great and reminds me of his World War II suit. The printing on the head piece is also great and really detailed. The shield is the same as always with the red white and blue.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Iron Man: Iron Man makes his only appearance in any of the civil war sets with his new mark 47 armor.&nbsp;The legs are printed with the gold details which is great. The torso is just magnificent with super detailed printing. The helmet piece is the same as the one his mark 45 armor from the quinjet aerial battle. There is a transparent blue plate with a transparent blue stick piece. This gives the appearance that he is shooting/blasting&nbsp;an enemy. This is great for people who like to display their lego sets.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Winter&nbsp;Soldier: The Winter Soldier makes his second appearance since the polybag&nbsp;that was released for the winter soldier movie. This version has a different facial appearance as he does not have his mask. The torso printing is the same as the poly bag with black jacket and the superb printing on his robotic arm. He comes with a gray gun to fight with.</strong></p>

<p><strong>War Machine: War Machine also makes his second appearance since the extremis seaport battle. He has a black suit compared to his gray one in the seaport battle. He also has a stud shooter and a black stick piece on the back of his suit. The printing is just so great&nbsp;that I can barely begin to&nbsp;describe it. He has silver printing on his mask and red eyes. The printing on his torso and legs is a lot like Iron Mans. Overall&nbsp;he is my second favorite minifigure in the set.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Scarlet Witch: Scarlet Witch also makes her second appearance since the Hulk Buster Smash set from the Age of Ultron movie. This time though, I feel like the minifigure is much better with better torso printing and a new hair piece. There are also transparent pink plates attached to studs to represent her powers. I think this is much better than the blue pieces used to represent it in the Hulk Buster Smash. Overall this is another great minifigure.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Agent 13/ Sharon Carter: This is an okay figure, although she is my&nbsp;least&nbsp;&nbsp;favorite in the set. Compared to all the other people I don&#39;t feel like she fits in, considering she wasn&#39;t even in this scene in the movie. I&#39;m just glad we even see this figure at all though. There is good printing on the torso and the hair piece is great. She comes with a black gun and is overall okay.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Giant Man/ Micro Ant Man: Micro Ant Man is just like the micro-figures you get in the shield helicarrier &nbsp;and he has great detail for such a small figure. I feel like this is a great and much needed addition to the set. By far my favorite and the coolest in my opinion is giant man. He just looks great. There are quite a few stickers used for the detail, but this is okay with me. The detail much resembles the Ant Man minifigure from the final battle set. There is no stickers for the back though, which to me is a minor complaint considering the rest of him is fantastic. The face piece is printed and great. There is a part of his mask that flips down to reveal his mouth as though he is pulling the mask off. There is tons of posability&nbsp;for those who like to display there legos. Overall he is the greatest attraction to this set in my opinion and a must have for any Marvel Superheroes fan.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The build: </strong>The build took me about 3 hours and was nice and pleasant with not much complicated structure. My favorite part of the build, however, was the airport tower.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The completed model:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The model looks fantastic when finished. The airport tower is much bigger than I was expecting. There are two&nbsp;great play features there. The first is one where you can attach a box to the side of the tower and then put the micro Ant Man in a hole in the back and push his head through. This then pushes the box out which acts like an exploding function. The second play feature is an exploding wall on the second story. This is a great feature and adds a lot to the set. There is a door leading into the first floor where the exploding box play feature is. The crates have stickers on them, one with Stark Industries, one with Hammer, and the last with A.I.M. This is a great addition and is really neat.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a fire extinguisher on the wall.&nbsp; There is a computer on the second floor with a cool 1 x 2 printed keyboard piece. On the third floor is the control tower with a bunch of screens for monitoring air planes. This floor is magnificently done with the windows giant gray windows and the antenna and satellite dish on the top. The fence on the side of the bottom floor is a nice addition to the set as well. Another play feature appears on the luggage cart. This one is where you push down on the back and send the luggage flying off. I wish there was some kind of worker though to drive the cart around or work up in the tower. The suit cases are really cool with the stickers and is a neat little addition. One of them is labeled Bill, one from Sokovia, and one from Wakanda. When I finished the quinjet, it was smaller than I was expecting it to be. It is about a third smaller than the Age of Ultron. The cockpit is about the same size only this one has enough space for two minifigures and there is a neat control panel to steer the quinjet with. There is a nob at the top that you turn and it lowers a twin stud&nbsp;shooter. This is a neat function which I think is much better than the one from the Age of Ultron quinjet. The back ramp of the quinjet can be lowered to reveal a rope that a minfigure can hold on to. One of my complaints is that there isn&#39;t more room for other minifigures in the back, and that there isn&#39;t some kind of barrier between the back and the compartment where the stud shooter is. Overall though this isn&#39;t that bad.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion:&nbsp;</strong>This is a must have for any Marvel Super Heroes fan just because of the minfigures. The set though is nice and there are some cool parts such as the airport tower. The quinjet&nbsp;is also&nbsp;nice, even though it is a bit small.&nbsp;If you are buying this because of the quinjet, I would recommend getting either the Age of Ultron&nbsp;one or the original S.H.I.E.L.D one from the first Avengers Movie. These are much better in my opinion and have much more space and better play features. Overall though, I must give this a 5/5.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"Faefrost","2016-12-16T07:30:26.763Z","May be the best Marvel set of the year","<p>This might be the best Marvel set we have seen recently. It has it all. Broad clear scene to recreate from the movie. Some highly off the wall builds and not typical subjects, and utterly fantastic minifigs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The unquestioned Star of the set is the huge brick built Ant Man/Giant Man. He is amazing in every way possible. He will quickly become part of you permanent display.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Runner up is the Quinjet. This is the third Quinjet we have gotten, and unquestionably the best of the bunch. It&#39;s the smallest by a wide margin, but is better for it. The lines, curves and colors much better match the on screen craft. It replaces gimmicks with good shaping and a solid build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs are great. The standout is the new War Machine. We also get a Civil War print Captain America with his full cowl, a Civil War print Iron Man to add to the armory. Scarlet Witch in a more updated outfit, The Winter Soldier who has become common, and the unique to this set Agent 13 Sharon Carter. Agent 13 is both a delight to get and a meh figure. As with ALL of the Marvel females they gave her the wrong hair color. She should be blonde. Very blonde. Famously so. The standard yellow blonde ponytail hairpiece would b a much better selection for her. We also get a teeny tiny incredibly painted Ant Man mini statue fig.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remainder of the set consists of serviceable destructible things for the heroes to toss around. The control tower and the baggage cart.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this is this years standout Marvel set. The Giant Ant Man figure is something we have never seen before, and is amazing.&nbsp;</p>

"LegoMoose","2017-11-17T15:10:04.547Z","LegoMoose's Super Hero Airport Battle review","<p>This is a great set!</p>

<p>From the playability to the building, this is just all in all a great set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is fun and easy. You don&#39;t need to be a very experienced builder in order to construct this set.</p>

<p>The control tower is nice, and it has a little play feature where you can blow out part of the tower. The set doesn&#39;t come with any actual minifigures to operate the tower. You also get this little luggage cart. The tower does make a good addition to a Lego City airport one might build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The quinjet&nbsp;is really nice. It has a sleek design with a bunch of play features&nbsp;integrated into the build. The cockpit can hold two minifigures, however they are a little hard to get in there just right. You can twist a little gear at the top and a gun will come down from the inside. You can open a hatch in the back and fit a minifigure in there if positioned right.</p>

<p>The Giant ant man is awesome! It&#39;s the first style of this build that we have gotten. It is an amazing build. It is sturdy and well detailed. Some people have bought this set just for the giant ant man.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigures&nbsp;are good, with Iron Man, War Machine, Captain America, Bucky Barnes, Scarlet Witch, Agent 13, and a microfigure ant man. (You actually get two of the microfigure&nbsp;ant man.)</p>

<p>This is just the poster child of a lego play set. Great features, minifigures, and builds. The price is set right, and you get a good amount of pieces. I am giving this set a solid <strong>5.0</strong> out of 5.</p>

<p>Have a good day/evening and happy building!</p>

"Bowtie_Bricks","2021-08-13T17:27:44.833Z","The perfect Marvel set","<p>This might be my favourite Marvel set. For it&#39;s $80 retail, it was well worth the money.</p>

<p>The figures in this set stand out; an exclusive Iron Man, War Machine, and Scarlet Witch. While Cap and Bucky aren&#39;t new or exclusive, they are a great inclusion, and allow for people to recreate scenes from the movie.</p>

<p>Ant-man deserves his own paragraph; the micro figure is a phenomenal&nbsp;thing to get, and even better, you get 2! But the real reason anyone bought this is for the giant man build. This was the first brick built lego figure, and all other ones have stemmed from it. While the stickers aren&#39;t ideal, the build still holds up. The mask fits the iconic character, and allows for you to fold down what covers his mouth, revealing a grin. He can even hold figures in his hands, great for recreating scenes!</p>

<p>I could go on all day about Giant-man, but the rest of the set is great as well. The tower is an easy build, but adds to the atmosphere. With spots for the Ant-man micro figure to be put, where it activates a play feature to explode boxes. I enjoyed the tower, and it looks good in a city as well.</p>

<p>The quinjet.... the worst part to the set, in my opinion. It&#39;s not a bad quinjet, but the 2015 version is hard to beat. The build is very sturdy; I&#39;ve dropped it so many times, but it hasn&#39;t broken. The only complaint it the lack of an interior. A knob can be spun to reveal stud shooters on the underbelly, but the small spot to put a figure doesn&#39;t satisfy after the roomy Age of Ultron version.</p>

"Gridlock007","2019-02-11T00:50:28.803Z","Avengers disassembled","<p>This set is very cool and detailed for a Marvel. I feel Lego Marvel doesn&#39;t&nbsp;get (as much)&nbsp;attention compared to DC. It was mostly accurate to the scene in the movie&nbsp;(Captain America: Civil War). I liked the references on&nbsp;the boxes. However, my pet peeve is Agent 13, who was not in the scene. I think she could have been replaced with Hawkeye, a normal sized Ant Man,&nbsp;or Spider-Man. As always, the Iron Man suit is exclusive. War Machines suit is awesome. It could fit into easily to your Lego City Airport. The Quinjet is The most accurate one yet.</p>
