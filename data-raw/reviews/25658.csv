What I hadn&#39;t realised though is how engaging my whole family would find it. My wife has declared it her favourite set, and that it&#39;s remarkably good value for how much entertainment we&#39;ve had already. My kids have been patiently waiting for their turn to play, and giving me feedback on new maze designs.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Like all Ideas sets this is a solid box with a proper opening lid, that can be re-used. The background design is very nice with a maze pattern all over. If I was rating just this area, I&#39;d probably knock a half point off because they didn&#39;t use the castle maze on the front (in fact it&#39;s not at all obvious that there are other maze options unless you look carefully).</p>

<p>The instruction book is perfect bound and the parts added on each step have a red outline. It can be quite a challenge to follow the maze construction with all the 2x4 tiles being added, and the outline helps.</p>

<p>Bags are not numbered.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is potentially&nbsp;a great part set. The price per part isn&#39;t out of line, but many of the parts are very large: 16x8 plates in black, 16x1&nbsp;and 12x1 bricks in tan, and then loads and loads of 2x4 tiles in tan and green, and a baseplate, of course.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>N/A</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is pretty genius. Hidden parts are colour coded in red, yellow or blue, so that you can definitely get things the right way round. It&#39;s got some interesting areas where things are strengthened (horizontal and vertical connections), which are quite interesting. The mechanism to tilt the maze is very clever.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>I think this looks great. We&#39;re leaving it out, and everyone who comes around has had a go. Complete as per the instructions is, of course, just the start because you then have the opportunity to build your own mazes. Should be great to see what others do. We did create a few straight away. I found that getting the mazes in and out was a bit of a tight fit, but no problems generally. I built a relatively heavy maze and found it find in terms of the mechanism (although very heavy bits needed to be central).</p>

<p>Here are a couple of mazes we did in the first weekend.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>Great value for just the parts, what Lego should be about, and hours and hours of entertainment for the whole family in just the first weekend - what&#39;s not to like.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the same quality you would expect from the other ideas sets - nice and sturdy sealed with tape on flaps so you do not have to destroy the box to open it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not really that knowledgeable&nbsp;on parts as my MOC ability is sorely lacking in ability but there are lots of flat tiles and baseplates. Also a big range of technic pieces as well.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was the most fun I have had in building a Lego set for a long long time. I have never built anything with technic pieces before (that was meant to move around) and so I was fascinated to see and figure out how the pieces came together to create the mechanism that lets the Maze work.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks fantastic. You get bricks to build to different mazes in the set, but you can only build one at a time as both mazes use some of the same bricks. I chose to go with the medieval maze and I ordered the extra parts I need to make the other maze - so I can just swap them out whenever I want rather than waste time rebuilding the mazes over and over and over and over again.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set has the most playability I have ever seen in a Lego set - in particular for adults I think. We all had little games like these come in our Stockings every year but now you have the added novelty of being able to design your own and it being made out of Lego of course. Mastering the controls can be a bit tricky but once you have that done the fun is timing yourself and seeing how fast you can get through each time with being caught in a trap. And then doing the maze in reverse and repeating the whole process again.</p>

<p>I cannot stress how awesome this set is. Go and buy it now!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a little tough to build but at the end it is wroth it. The playability&nbsp;is amazing!! The fact that you can change the maze is just great. Kids and Adults of all ages will love this set. I think that the gear tilting&nbsp;needs to be better though. I loved how it came with four balls because sometimes you might lose them. I think this set is a great set to get.&nbsp;</p>

The different layouts were fun and challenging. I&#39;m actually (pleasantly) surprised at how much of the thing is brick-built! Well worth the money;&nbsp;great parts;&nbsp;10 out of 10!</p>
