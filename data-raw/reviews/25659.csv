<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes with a small box and a small instruction. At the front the box shows a piggy car and the yellow bird, the yellow bird is flying after the piggy car. At the back of the box it shows all the play features, actually it,s only one; the flick fire missile. The box also have a smooth surface.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;ll think the part selection in this set is really bad! 74 parts in a 12.99$ set. You are getting some of the new &quot;egg&quot; parts which is really cool. The bird parts are also rare and quite nice. The other parts in this set is just normal bad parts, you can build the car from your own pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You are getting two figures: one yellow bird and one pig. If you want the set only for the figures i&#39;ll think the price is waay too high.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took me around 8 minutes and was boring. Maybe the build is more challenging for younger kids but for me the build was just a boring normal build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Suuuper ugly and bad! You actually pay just for the figures. The car looks like a TMNT car(my opinion).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overpriced bad set. Maybe someone like it but NOT me!</p>

Well it would seem that we were wrong. This is the smallest set from the range and so I nabbed it to get a feel for this new Theme. What follows is my review of the set and how I feel concerning LEGO&rsquo;s attempt at making sets based on a film that many considered coming out far too late to take advantage of the interest in the franchise.</span></span></span></span></p>

I can&rsquo;t recall many Themes that use a base white colour for their box designs before adding the images to them. The front of this box shows off the set, the back also shows the set with a nice artwork image used in the background. The features are shown, what few there are, and the figures are there. Overall a fairly decent design for this theme.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: Fairly straight forward Instruction manual here. As is customary from LEGO the step-by-step build instructions are represented quite nicely with clear and concise indicators. The manual is also not broken up, some of these smaller sets in years have decided to break the build up between numbered manuals, which still confuses me. Thankfully that isn&rsquo;t the case here. There aren&rsquo;t very many images in the back though, just a page showing off the website and nothing else for cross-promotions.</span></span></span></span></p>

You&rsquo;ll find three in white and one in bley, which is great because this is a relatively cheap set to get those parts in it. Though if you want multiples it may be easier for MOC fans to hit up Bricklink.</span></span></span></span></p>

Chuck is the speedy yellow bird and his sculpt is fairly interesting. There&rsquo;s some nice printing for his face and a softer plastic like rubber is used for his tail and tuft of hair on top of his head. The same plastic is used for his beak.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s an interesting piece, and captures the likeness of the movie model from the animation quite nicely. Some may find the seam line between the two halves of the sculpt to be ugly. It is unfortunate LEGO chose this route for this sculpt.</span></span></span></span></p>

Of the two characters in this set I&rsquo;d say that Piggy is the better of the pair. He looks better, the sculpt is awesome and the facial printing is hilarious. He includes three eggs to steal for accessories.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s almost not worth discussing however I believe in being thorough with these reviews.</span></span></span></span></p>

It doesn&rsquo;t have much, but it works for the simplistic design of the film and I really think this is a pretty solid model.</span></span></span></span></p>

LEGO Fans in general may not be as interested in this, there are few rare parts, the Minifigures in general or of a stylistic design that may not appeal to everybody and the model can be seen as rather weak. Especially as it didn&rsquo;t actually appear in the film proper in use, merely as a stuck in storage vehicle on the Piggy&rsquo;s ship.</span></span></span></span></p>

Everybody else may prefer to stick with such Themes as Ninjago and the like. The main play pattern for the larger sets isn&rsquo;t even featured here, there are no Catapults, no Breakaway elements for simulated Angry Bird attacks and not much in the way of accessories or decent parts.</span></span></span></span></p>

"J14T14","2019-05-06T17:43:02.867Z"," Egg-cellent Set","<p>I got this set for my birthday as kind of a gag gift due to how off putting the movie is. I love LEGO&nbsp;(thanks captain obvious) and I liked the Angry Birds game, so I didn&#39;t mind getting this despite it being based off of the movie. I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised&nbsp;by this set.</p>

<p>The minifigures are odd. The same mold is used for all the pigs but just with different face prints. I thin that this works and I like the look of this pig. The facial expression reminds me of the game after you use up all your birds and the pigs start to laugh. The only articulation is the arms and the hands, which are just standard minifigure arms and hands. Chuck is also great. I don&#39;t like the mold-line going down the center of hs body, but it isn&#39;t too bad. His beak and hair are rubber since they are so thin. The feet are painted on, so the only&nbsp;colors used is yellow (hard plastic), as well as black and orange (both are rubber). The arms are new molds used on most of the birds in this wave. I don&#39;t like the lack of articulation in the hands, and I don&#39;t like how they can&#39;t hold onto the undersides of studs like regular minifigures. The arms can move back and forth and that is it.</p>

<p>The Piggy car itself only briefly appears in the movie when the birds open a door when they are on the pig&#39;s boat. It can be seen in the center of the screen on a turntable for a couple seconds. In comparison to that, it looks accurate. I like the flame coming out the back and the new egg piece being used in light gray&nbsp;for the jet engine intake. I also like the cupcake flick-fire istle included. This adds some play value and it is something that I could see the pigs using. There is also a nest on the back that holds two eggs.</p>

<p>Overall, I really enjoyed this set. It is not for everyone, but it is an interesting thing to add to your collection.</p>
