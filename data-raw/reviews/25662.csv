"TheBrickPal","2016-04-23T20:26:10.573Z","A STELLAr set from a license I was scaRED about!","<p>Like many others, I was apprehensive when The LEGO Group announced in June 2015&nbsp;their deal with Rovio Entertainment to produce sets based on the highly anticipated (in my point of view)&nbsp;film adaption of the most popular&nbsp;mobile app series of all time;&nbsp;Angry Birds. However, I was willing to give LEGO the benefit of the doubt in hopes that the sets could be up to the quality standard the company has provided us with for as long as we can remember.</p>

<p>When images of the six sets emerged in December, the community became much more positive about the existence of a LEGO The Angry Birds Movie license&nbsp;and therefore began to await&nbsp;the release of the theme in April 2016. Now it&#39;s release&nbsp;month. When the aforementioned images released, I found myself most attracted to&nbsp;75824 Pig City Teardown for its unique cartoonish look, the&nbsp;accurate&nbsp;portrayal of a&nbsp;location which will feature prominently in the film, its&nbsp;range of minifigs, and playability replicating what made the Angry Birds games so fun in the first place.</p>

<p>Seeing as Huw has already supplied our staff review for the homepage, I&#39;m resorting to sharing&nbsp;my opinion using this method. I&#39;m going&nbsp;out of my way to review&nbsp;this intriguing set because it deserves all of the praise it can possibly get. So without further ado, let&#39;s begin!</p>

<h3>Source material</h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/YvSXF4b.jpg"" style=""width: 300px; height: 161px;"" /></p>

<p>While looking at a quick shot from one of the trailers, the set compares very favorably with the source material! Though no hot dog stand in sight...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box of 75824&nbsp;surprised me, to be honest. The material it is made of is very glossy and reminds me of the packaging used for The LEGO Movie sets in 2014 and early 2015. Very high-quality! On the box itself, we have some very beautiful and colorful art. The back illustrates the play features, and believe me... there are a lot!</p>

<p>Inside, there are two large instruction booklets and three&nbsp;bags. The flexi-tube&nbsp;pieces used for the zipline&nbsp;come loose; while only two are needed&nbsp;to build&nbsp;the set, an extra is included anyway.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>MEDIUM AZURE. NUFF SAID.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In all seriousness, there&#39;s so much to drool over here. Five of the new egg piece&nbsp;is&nbsp;included, which look great. A red umbrella also features, which is brand new for me. Of course, the birds and pigs are all new molds, which I&#39;ll get to in the next section.</p>

<p>A lot of stickers are used, which I actually&nbsp;don&#39;t mind applying, unlike others. Plus, these ones are made much better than the stickers in a lot of sets from&nbsp;previous years. And the set really isn&#39;t &#39;complete&#39; without them.</p>

<p>And the one thing that has everybody&nbsp;excited: a hot dog bun. A FLIPPIN&#39; LEGO HOT DOG BUN. The original sausage piece clips into it and fits snugly. An anti-stud is located at the bottom in order for a minifigure to hold it or for it to fit on other bricks.</p>

<p>Drool session over.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Before I begin, I must say that the birds come packaged in their own little plastic bags: this implies that these pieces are&nbsp;made in China, while the pigs aren&#39;t. Not an issue, I&#39;m just saying!</p>

<p>Also, the minifigs&nbsp;ended up being&nbsp;much smaller than I thought they would be; shorter than the typical minifigs&nbsp;who resemble humans!&nbsp;All&nbsp;of the&nbsp;minifigs&nbsp;in this theme may be odd, but they sure are accurate and that&#39;s all I could possibly ask for from LEGO.</p>

<p>Now...</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Red&nbsp;</b>is the main protagonist of the Angry Birds game series and thus the movie itself. While he has four other variations across the sets in this theme, this specific version is my favorite as the face printing most closely&nbsp;matches his classic, generic&nbsp;angry&nbsp;expression.&nbsp;Nothing can be done to improve the figure, in my opinion.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><b>Stella</b>&nbsp;is a fan-favorite Angry Birds character, even having her own spinoff game, so her appearance here is very welcome. On closer inspection, most of her body&nbsp;is regular plastic, while her beak is rubbery.&nbsp;She is one of&nbsp;only two female characters represented in this line. Stella is the tallest minifig in the set, which makes sense given that she is one of the&nbsp;tallest birds in the film. Her molding and printing are awesome, and her height means she is the best bird to use when launching at Pig City&#39;s many targets! It will be interesting to see how important of a role Stella ends up having in the film itself.</li>
	<li>The iconic, green and mean &#39;Bad&#39;&nbsp;<b>Piggies</b>&nbsp;have made their way to becoming&nbsp;LEGO minifigures! Two are included and look absolutely perfect and accurate to their appearance in&nbsp;the film. Each has their own hilarious facial expression; one cheerful fellow to run the hot dog stand, and the other a&nbsp;scared zipline-riding&nbsp;swine! The pigs are more related to the typical &#39;system&#39; LEGO uses for their minifigs, due to&nbsp;them having regular arms attached to the new molded body. My&nbsp;only criticism is the fact that they both use black hands. I have no idea why;&nbsp;they&nbsp;could have easily been lime green to match the rest of the figure&#39;s color.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build took a tiny bit over an&nbsp;hour in total, but that might just be me and my distractions (I like doing other things while I build; multitasking for the win!). Overall, it was pretty fun, but aggravating at times. I found myself accidentally activating some of the play features while I was building, so it was a bit annoying to keep&nbsp;having to reset them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>LOVE. Love love love, love love. This has got to be one of my most favorite location-based LEGO sets of all time. The little details like the Pig Fone (yay,&nbsp;the piggies&nbsp;are as dumb as they have always been!) and the crate of TNT (an object carried over from the games)&nbsp;make it all worthwhile.</p>

<p>Of course, the play features designed to help the birds steal back their&nbsp;eggs&nbsp;are the main draw. And while they all work as they are supposed to, trying to activate them using the (might I add nicely&nbsp;designed) catapult can be a challenge. This doesn&#39;t bother me too much,&nbsp;as I enjoy testing my skills and it adds to the play value in a way,&nbsp;but it may be an issue for others. Everything else severely outweighs this con, making it an otherwise fantastic set.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Overall opinion</span></h3>

<p>GET THIS SET. For $40, it&#39;s everything it looks to be&nbsp;and&nbsp;more. If you get set one set from LEGO The Angry Birds Movie, make it this one. Get it for a fun afternoon play session. Get it for a parts pack. Just get it.&nbsp;Even if you don&#39;t think you&#39;ll like this theme, go for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;I sure did, and now it&nbsp;stands proudly on my shelf amongst&nbsp;Star Wars and Super Heroes.</p>

<p>I keep taking it off the shelf and setting it&nbsp;onto my bedroom floor to play with it, and <i>that is</i>&nbsp;saying something; I never play&nbsp;with my LEGO sets anymore. That&nbsp;sentence alone should show you the power of 75824 Pig City Teardown.</p>

"dRevan","2017-12-14T18:52:12.257Z","Pig City Teardown","<p>Angry Birds line is a weird theme for me. The sets were okay but the minifigures are bizarre. The minifigures are heading towards the Mega Blocks Minions type of figures but retaining the crisp Lego quality. The figures are not bad, in fact they are very movie accurate, but stand out amongst minifigures and mini dolls. Another problem is the articulation: the figures are one complete mold and unlike minifigures do not need to be assembled.</p>

<p>Pig City Teardown is a set that is very reminiscent of the Angry Birds game. The set has 4 figures, 2 builds, has 386 parts and retails for $49.99.</p>

<p><strong>Set</strong>:<br />
The build consists of the Pig City and a small catapult for the birds. The catapult is a simple build but has some cool parts. There are 2 1x4 printed tiles used to add texture and a flesh coloured bucket piece to hold a minifigure.<br />
The whole premise of the set is to knock over parts of the Pig City which consists of a hot dog stand, zip line, payphone, chicken coop to hold the eggs, and a dynamite container.&nbsp;<br />
The small pay phone is a nice touch and besides that is trough containing four ice creams. Leading up to the steps is the hot dog stand. The build is good enough to place in a City with a few modifications. The hot dog bun accessory is an fantastic piece and makes the set worth it just for the piece. The stand also has a grill and condiment dispensers.</p>

<p>Joining the coop and the hot dog stand is a ramp containing more of the 1x4 wooden tiles. There are three balloons holding the ramp and when the balloons are hit, the ramp falls down bringing down the person on it.<br />
<br />
The chicken coop is actually a decent build. It is enclosed on the sides by the 1x4 picket fence pieces, has a small entrance via a 2x2 yellow flag piece and has a light on top. The inside is spacious and contains 5 of the new egg pieces. The egg mold is another fantastic accessory. On top of the coop, is the mechanism for the zipline and a crank to hold the huge boulder. The zipline is a fun feature and has a set of lights on top and a boulder which holds the trigger to launch the zip line.&nbsp;<br />
The crank is part of another play feature. Holding the crank in place is a small fan which acts as the trigger. When hit, it falls back, activate the boulder which falls down on to the crate of dynamite below. The dynamite then falls over and you would expect an explosion. The dynamite stand has a 2x2 print of TNT which is a nice nod to the game. The tile only appears in this set and the Pig Castle set.&nbsp;<br />
The play features are fun and thoroughly entertaining. The build is cool but the base of the build is mediocre as 8 2x4 bricks are used to hold the whole thing together and give it some height.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong>:<br />
- All Angry Birds are exclusive to their own set which is a cool thing I have never seen before Lego do.</p>

<p>1. Stella: The figure has a pink colour scheme with a plume of feathers on top. Her beak is made out of rubber which is a bit flimsy. Due to the plume, the figure gains extra height compared to other figures.</p>

<p>2. Red: The figure has a determined expression which is not bad but I would have preferred an angrier expression.</p>

<p>3. and 4. The pig are unnamed. One has a open mouthed aaah! face which is really funny and the other has a smug smile. Both are funny and adorable figures.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong>: The set satisfies the price point and has enough figures for it as well. The parts are what I initially bought the set for like the hot dog bun piece and the egg piece. The build is not good as a displat piece but when taken apart is a treasure of fantastic parts. I bought the set at a 40% discount which more than justified the price for the set.</p>

<p><strong><em>Rating: 3.5/5</em></strong></p>
