<p>As the movie&#39;s now been out for a couple of weeks I can say my thoughts on it... it was alright.&nbsp; Way better than expected for a movie based on an app, with the rapid and hilarious comedy from the cast keeping me entertained throughout, although it isn&#39;t particularly memorable or intelligent. I&#39;d say more, but this is more of a review of the set based on it, and this wave captures the look and fun of the movie excellently.</p>

<h3>The Box</h3>

<p>The box is abnormally large for a set at this price point--it&#39;s the same size used for the recent TIE Fighter only much thicker as a bonus. Nonetheless, it&#39;s size and eye-catching color really got me excited when I picked it up.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/FOQJ9Ck.jpg"" style=""width: 1224px; height: 1632px;"" /></p>

<p>Inside, you&#39;ll find six numbered bags of parts, with a bag containing the cloth sails, and a single thick-bound instruction booklet with 113 pages of building.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are lots of very interesting parts in the set, of which a good amount are brand-new recolors, shown below. Some of them of note are a Tub and two six-spoked hexagonal plates in medium nougat, a large airplane roof in brown, and a small one in dark bley, two different sizes of cupboards in new colors, with 2 of each, two pennants in tan, and a large, inverted arch in brown. The gold 1x1 round plate, the magenta 2x3 arch and the large brown girder are not new, however only appear in a couple sets.</p>

<p>We also see plenty of new prints (luckily no stickers are in the set). There&#39;s a generous 10 1x4 tiles with a plank print, a large shield with pig nostrils, and a very useful-looking recipe to cook eggs fried, just as the pigs like &#39;em! Four of the theme-exclusive eggs are included.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/KIoIkoQ.jpg?1"" style=""width: 1280px; height: 1280px;"" /></p>

<p>More importantly is the inclusion of the cloth sails that keep the ship sailing, as it includes three differently sized, egg-shaped sails, along with fourth pennant with a pig logo. They&#39;re made of a papery, water-resistant material, and they&#39;re printed with amateur stitches. Sheesh, no wonder they end up being beaten til&#39; they can&#39;t breathe...</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/oChC5B5.jpg"" style=""width: 1280px; height: 1280px;"" /></p>

<h3>The Birds and the Piggies</h3>

<p>There are four figures included--two of which are bird and two pigs. The birds are <strong>Red </strong>and <strong>Bomb. </strong></p>

<p><strong><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/UEgvhOd.jpg"" style=""width: 1632px; height: 1224px;"" /></strong></p>

<p>Despite some flack from the fans for their designs, this isn&#39;t Lego&#39;s fault. They are very good representations of the characters in the movie with their very round and organic shapes, complete with poseable feathered arms and rubbery tails. Red, voiced by Jason Sudekis and offering a great exxagerated but relatable grump, isn&#39;t particularly angry unlike every other set, and appears more annoyed and bored than anything, but still gives off plenty of expression. Bomb, voiced by Danny McBride is exclusive to this set, and that&#39;s kind of a shame given he&#39;s the biggest and best bird to be knocking the pig&#39;s stuff down with that catapult.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/HTzn903.jpg"" style=""width: 1632px; height: 1224px;"" /></p>

<p>For the pigs, we get both the overly charismatic Leonard, voiced by Bill Hader, along with a generic pirate. They both use the same mold with standard minifig arms, and both offer very goofy expressions. As for the color, bright green would be preferable but these are still good.</p>

<p>Unfortuantely, the door is too small to fit a pig inside, and no ramp is included so that Leonard can make his dramatic entrance.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>I had a blast building this set. I haven&#39;t taken photos in-build, but I have one showing the internal mechanism, which in play rotates the water mills and flips the oars simultaneously.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/wGwwEFm.jpg"" style=""width: 1224px; height: 1632px;"" /></p>

<p>While it may look like a jumbled mess of colors, which it is, this works by having a set of wheels underneath. It&#39;s not a &quot;ship&quot; if you take that literally, but they&#39;re connected to a gear, which is connected to another gear, which spins the mills at their axis. That same gear has a crank connected to one of its pinholes, which pushes a few bricks that are clipped on to the oars, moving them forward and back in a circular motion with varying speed. It&#39;s a genius trick and it works phenomenally.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most of this is blocked by the walls and roof of the deck, however the undersized door that Leonard couldn&#39;t squeeze in to serves as window to the inside, so with a little light, a happy kid could show the inner workings to his or her friends. It&#39;s a nice touch :).</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/JVwSv4i.jpg"" style=""width: 1280px; height: 1280px;"" /></p>

<h3>The Model in all it&#39;s Glory</h3>

<p>And I thought the box was oversized for the price point. This thing is really big, measuring 45 centimeters tall and 30 wide, or a foot by a foot and a half! While much of this may be due to its thin width and the cartoonishly tall masts, it makes it both impressive to have it show up and crash Bird Island, and it has lots of surface area to launch the birds at them, like in the game.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/FZQvsNA.jpg"" style=""width: 1224px; height: 1632px;"" /></p>

<p>The ship&#39;s also kind of a joke with it&#39;s all-around smooth walls and really bizarre proportions. I was initially really confused which side the bow and the stern were! It&#39;s even equipped with a huge steampunk gear, and a wrecking ball that used for the anchor (and unintentionally, a wrecking ball when it crashed Red&#39;s house).</p>

<p>It&#39;s an even bigger joke next to MetalBeard&#39;s Sea Cow...</p>

<p>Another good engineering trick is that the gear and the anchor actually act as a winch! It&#39;s a lot simpler than the main gearing, but it&#39;s still really fun as it involved threading the string in the weirdest places, but operates smoothly and can cause major destruction.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/8mk7unG.jpg"" style=""width: 1224px; height: 1632px;"" /></p>

<p>In the back, the eggs are also hooked onto a nicely folded net, and there&#39;s a large rudder that can rotate.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/JLjXs4y.jpg"" style=""width: 1224px; height: 1632px;"" /></p>

<p>The arguable most important feature, though, is that of launching the Angry Birds at the ship to save the eggs that the pigs are gonna eat. It&#39;s dark when you realize they&#39;re cannibalizing children in the kitchen... (although there&#39;s also a crate of bananas and tomatoes in the back so that could buy some time)</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/bCENzBI.jpg"" style=""width: 1224px; height: 1632px;"" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately the only place that it can hit off easily is the net of eggs in the back, and while that&#39;s the only thing that matters in the movie&#39;s context, the rest of the model is super sturdy, and while it&#39;s lighter than I thought it&#39;d be, it&#39;s still hard to tip over and destroy. That&#39;s definitely good for sailing the thing around water, but if you&#39;re looking for a good game-style beating you&#39;re gonna have to make some adjustments. Luckily I&#39;ve found it&#39;s simple to loosen a few of the connections that appear precarious, suck as the tall mast, the bowsprit, and the poop deck.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/0iVKEK1.jpg"" style=""width: 1224px; height: 1632px;"" /></p>

<p>Then with a little target practice, you can dismantle the establishment board by board! Saw the tables of charity in half! Gnaw on the foundations of big business!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;m surprised that this line of sets have been as excellent as they have, as all of the ones I own have been a ton of fun to play and cause complete chaos to the point where even I take it off the shelve and play with it on the floor frequently, and these have also been a huge hit with my little brother for those same reasons only more hyper and exhausting. I imagine the millions of kids buying this would be extremely happy. If you&#39;re an adult fan, however, this is may (keyword MAY) be too playful and cartoony for your own good, and if you love the game (which is unlikely given Rovio almost filed for bankrupcy), sets like the Pig City Teardown are far better. However it&#39;s be interesting to look at for its new parts, and I&#39;d take a look at the instructions as a lot care went into the build. And at the very low price of $59.99 next to both the volume and the play value, I&#39;d buy it as soon as you can!</p>

<p>Whats in the box?</p>

<p>110+ page instruction book</p>

<p>6 bags containing 620 parts</p>

<p>The Build</p>

<p>The build took me 1.5 hours and was fairly easy except for the winch which was challenging. The model used many fascinating techniques and pieces</p>

<p>The Completed Model</p>

<p>At a foot long and 18 inches tall, it is very tall but it plays illusions as it is very narrow and slim but I don&#39;t find it an issue. The 4 figures are good and well-printed though I wished they did add one more pig on the ship. I also wished the back tower was more intricate and a bit taller.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>620 pieces for $60</p>

<p>Fun build that isn&#39;t to hard</p>

<p>2 exclusive figures (Bomb and Pirate Pig)</p>

<p>fun for display and good for MOCs</p>

"Matt_Z_","2017-06-11T07:08:35.17Z","Surprisingly Satisfying","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>75825-1 Piggy Pirate Ship is a unique, fun, and playable building experience that offers something for everyone. This licensed theme in particular is not one that I collect personally, but I was able to acquire this set at a considerable discount. I&#39;ll run through some pros and cons and finish up with a recommendation.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<p><strong>Extended playability:</strong> There are a lot of moving parts in this set, which leads to high playability. The crane with rock, descending fishing net, side oars, water mill feature, and bird launcher all bring action to this set. This helps make this set ideal for kids and teens who often seek out Lego sets with numerous play features.</p>

<p><strong>Inviting colour scheme:</strong> I was pleased to see a variety of colors in this set. The interior&nbsp;design incorporates yellow/red/green pieces. The outside of the ship brings a pleasing mix of brown, beige (sails), nougat, with hints of light green from both the printed sail and the figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Fine parts:</strong> The printed wooden plank pieces in nougat are a welcome addition for those wishing to source this set for parts. Those who despise stickers need not worry here. This set also had 4 white eggs which are rare and a printed &quot;fried egg recipe&quot;. Additional accessories such as sword, apple, ice cream, etc help add value.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bizzare design:</strong> As a functioning ship, the design itself isn&#39;t the most appealing. High to low verticality issues on the hull offer up an unorthodox ship, and the sails themselves don&#39;t necessarily make sense. However, due to the target audience (kids), functionality and playability win out over design here. AFOL&#39;s won&#39;t build it for the look, but would be better served to source this set for parts.</p>

<p><strong>Price point:</strong> For $75.00 CAD, I&#39;m fairly confident I&#39;d pass up this set. For $45.00 CAD, this was a great deal, offering an unheard of 7.26c/p ratio, well below the average for licensed themes. It&#39;s real hard for me to write this as a con when I received the set at a discount, but again, paying full retail price would be expensive.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion and Recommendation</strong></p>

<p>This set offers something for everyone. Kids and TFOL&#39;s will likely find rewarding play features and color schemes in this set that offer many adventures and extended play time. AFOL&#39;s&nbsp;will be best served to source this set for harder to find pieces and colors. If you&#39;re able to grab this set at any sort of discount, I&#39;d highly recommend it. I grabbed one for my cousin who absolutely loves the play features, and personally, I sourced the set for parts which was also rewarding. Both of us walked away satisfied.</p>

<p>Until next time,</p>

<p>Matt Z.</p>
