It is a good deal with 859 pieces, and 3 exclusive minifigures. The outside looks very detailed. It also has a very wacky but charming feel as the technology of the pigs differs from ours. One weak spot I would like to address is the catapult. At first, I was looking forward greatly to the catapult that looks like a slingshot but the problem is when launching, it falls apart very easily. The castle also has a very bland interior and I believe they should have focused more on making an interior and play features based on the movie scene. I personally believe they should have added 400 more pieces to make a more detailed interior and play features based on the movie. Even without those, this set has some amazing pieces a magnificent outside look and fun catapult features.</p>

<p>lacks the ability to create movie scenes</p>
