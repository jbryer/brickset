"xboxtravis7992","2016-06-16T19:51:59.58Z","My First Full CMF Set","<p>I have been a bit of a Disney-phille my whole life. Disneyland has been a frequent destination vacation for me; and a lot of the classic Disney films were commonly viewed by VHS tape in my childhood. As I have grown I have grown to recognize the rather amazing story in how Walt Disney was able to build arguably&nbsp;<em>the&nbsp;</em>entertainment empire of the world from a small studio making short cartoons; and how that empire has evolved in the years since his passing. The selection of Minifigures&nbsp;Lego has produced has given us a slice at that history, from Disney&#39;s roots as small studio; to their reinvention&nbsp;in the 1990&#39;s; to their modern works shared with subsidiary studios such as Pixar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With my admiration for Disney; this is the first CMF series I have finally made an effort in collecting in its entirety. Amassing&nbsp;the collection required frequently checking small town Wal-Marts, and other&nbsp;stores in my local area; and even acquiring a few of the figures at Downtown Disney in Anaheim outside the gates of Disneyland itself. I owe my collection to the valuable help and patience of my parents and sister; who helped buy a few figures and even stood in stores with me feeling the polybags with me (my sister is fully responsible for feeling the bags for my Captain Hook and Aladdin figures). It has been quite a journey to amass this collection!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since CMF lines are hardly traditional Lego sets, this review will focus solely on each unique minifig. I will try and place figures in a rough chronology of the release of their original source material; as I feel the collection is best viewed as a slice of Disney&#39;s history.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Mickey Mouse</strong></p>

<p>Created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks&nbsp;for the film&nbsp;<em>Plane Crazy,&nbsp;</em>Mickey debuted publicly alongside Minnie Mouse in the film&nbsp;<em>Steamboat Willie</em>, one of the earliest films to use sound. The Lego version of Mickey is based on his &quot;standard&quot; appearance in red shorts with yellow shoes. Unfortunately this is one of Mickey&#39;s most bland outfits, and that diminishes the appeal of the Lego version. Despite its standard looks, the figure does feature a new molded head (shared with Minnie) and dual molded legs. Ultimately I am satisfied to have this figure, although it is likely its value will increase using the head with different outfits to represent Mickey&#39;s different guises over the years.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minnie Mouse</strong></p>

<p>Minnie fares far better than her boyfriend of 87 years. Her pink dress is similar to Mickey in the sense it is a &quot;standard&quot; look for her in the modern era. However the figure is full of detail, the new skirt piece being a highlight. Minnie also uses dual molded arms and legs which greatly enhance the figure. A pink bow attaches to the head to finish the figure.&nbsp;Like Mickey though, she comes with no additional accessories.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Donald Duck</strong></p>

<p>Created in 1934, Donald is the famed short tempered duck of Disney&#39;s animated short films. He is an interesting figure, and is dressed in his &quot;standard&quot; sailor outfit. The head is a new mold shared with Daisy; and I have noticed is already appearing in a lot of MOCs in the Lego fan community.&nbsp;The hat is unique, and connects to Donald via a peg connector. The tail piece is a soft rubber, and the legs are dual molded. Donald is a great figure, and is fun to have.</p>

<p><strong>Daisy Duck</strong></p>

<p>Daisy is a bit more of a bland Lego figure than Donald; as the muted pink colors used on her don&#39;t stand out as much as Donald&#39;s bright blue colors. She still uses dual molded legs and arm, and comes with the same rubber tail piece as Donald. Her bow is the same mold used for Minnie&#39;s; but lacks the complex printing. Daisy was created in 1940, and represent the last of the figures from Disney&#39;s &quot;short cartoon&quot; era. After the release of&nbsp;<em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs </em>in 1937, Disney began an increased focus on theatrical films which will be the source of the rest of the Lego figures in this theme.</p>

<p><strong>Alice</strong></p>

<p>Based on the character from the 1951 film based on Lewis Carrols&#39; writings; Alice was a figure I wasn&#39;t to excited for and was my last acquisition while collecting the line. However, once I had the figure in hand, I was surprised by how great it is. Alice comes with dual molded arms, and a skirt piece from the same mold as Minnie&#39;s. Alice&#39;s hair piece is new, and is rather smooth and &quot;cartoony.&quot; The best part of Alice is the addition of a cookie and glass bottle to represent the &quot;Drink Me&quot; and &quot;Eat Me&quot; concoctions from the film. Alice was a figure that far surpassed my expectations.</p>

<p><strong>The Cheshire Cat</strong></p>

<p>The first of three figures which use short legs, the Cheshire Cat is a unique figure. His headpiece is new, and his tail is the same formerly used for Rocket Racoon in the Guardians of The Galaxy line; but now in a new pink color. The short legs are a unique subject... I can&#39;t tell if the stripe on them is a high quality print, or a new example of Lego &quot;tri-molding&quot; a piece. The figure is impressive, but suffers from it&#39;s humanoid form since the Cheshire Cat is in the film a four legged creature, and loses part of its personality standing on two legs here in Lego form.</p>

<p><strong>Peter Pan&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The hero from the 1953 film of the same name, Peter Pan originated as a stage character that would gain additional fame in Disney&#39;s film. The figure is accurate; and has a new hair/hat mold, and dual molded arms and legs. The one strange part is the dual knifes that come with the figure... which are molded in a strange pearl gold which differs from the packaging&#39;s (and film accurate)&nbsp;silver color. It is also strange to see him wielding two knifes; although this is a necessity due to the sprue molded nature of the Lego piece. This figure is fun; and I can&#39;t help but wonder how he would look with the recently released Big Ben set...</p>

<p><strong>Captain Hook</strong></p>

<p>The antagonist from&nbsp;<em>Peter Pan</em>; Captain Hook&#39;s outlandish behavior in the animated film is iconic, and I am glad that Lego has succeeded in capturing his character! His face is comically villainous, and his hat/hair piece is a wonderful mold. One of my favorite figures in this wave.</p>

<p><strong>Maleficent&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The villain from the 1959 film&nbsp;<em>Sleeping Beauty</em>, it is strange that she is included in the series; but not any other characters from the film. Still the figure is a wonderful sight, with two cape pieces to build her robes, a golden staff, and a hard rubber hat piece that gives the figure uniquely villainous horns. This is the last figure representing the classic Disney film era. Walt Disney would die in 1966 from complications with lung cancer, and for the following decades The Walt Disney Company would wander a bit aimlessly. Things began to slowly change first with the release of the 1988 film&nbsp;<em>Who Framed Rodger Rabbit&nbsp;</em>which was co-produced with Amblin Productions; but the definitive return to form for Disney would occur with the film represented by the next to figures in the Lego series...</p>

<p><strong>Ariel</strong></p>

<p>The 1989 film&nbsp;<em>The Little Mermaid</em>&nbsp;was a resounding success, and fully launched Disney animated films back into the public spotlight. The success of the film would inspire future Disney films, an effect that is seen in almost all the following films represented by the rest of the Lego figures in this series. Ariel is a unique figure with her mermaid tail which has been previously seen in other CMF lines, but is now seen in unique colors and prints for Ariel. Areil&#39;s hair piece is a spot on representation of her animated hair, and looks wonderful. She comes with a clam with a gem, a small accessory which isn&#39;t entirely needed but is fun to have.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ursula</strong></p>

<p>One of the most unique figures produced in this line, Ursula comes with a new molded body piece to represent her octopus form. A new hair piece rounds out the look of the figure. Ursula is one of the least poseable figures in the line, but her unique looks help cement this as a favorite figure of mine.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Aladdin&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The 1992 film <em>Aladdin</em>&nbsp;continued Disney&#39;s wave of hits in the early 1990&#39;s. The figure here is a great rendition of the figure; and many Lego fans will enjoy having new pieces in a rarely used skin tone in the Lego palette. My only critique is the inclusion of the same lamp included in the Genie, missing out on the opportunity to include Abu in Lego form. Aladdin is still a great figure, and a great addition to the CMF lineup.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Genie</strong></p>

<p>Also from the film&nbsp;<em>Aladdin,&nbsp;</em>Genie was voiced by the late Robin Williams; whose rather recent passing makes this figure feel like a very fitting part of the lineup. The figure uses a tail piece used in previous CMF Genies, and also includes the same lamp that comes with Aladdin. The head piece is a new mold, and comes with a unique hair piece that connects via a peg. A great figure for the line.</p>

<p><strong>Buzz Lightyear</strong></p>

<p>With the success of <em>The Little Mermaid</em>, and later <em> Beauty and the Beast,&nbsp;Aladdin,</em> and <em>The Lion King</em>,&nbsp;animated films spiked in popularity. Even while Disney was beginning to churn out hit after hit, interest was sparked in a new form of animation using computer generated images. Pixar a computer animated division of George Lucas&#39;s Lucasfilm studios, until it was spun off.&nbsp;Ed Catmull&nbsp;(of my alma mater) headed Pixar as a new independent company in 1986, when Steve Jobs bought the firm from George Lucas. Under Steve Job&#39;s ownership, Catmull&#39;s&nbsp;leadership, and (the now controversial) John&nbsp;Lasseter&#39;s creative lead, the firm produced the first theatrical length animated film&nbsp;<em>Toy Story</em>&nbsp;which deputed in 1994 and was distributed by Disney.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buzz has appeared before in Lego form, in the 2010 Toy Story Theme, but his new minifigure shows several updates. His molded head has been replaced by a standard minifigure head.His body features new leg and arm prints, even including the &quot;laser&quot; on his right arm. The torso print is bland, but complements his bulky space suit armor. His visor is always half open, a feature which disappointed my mother when she tried to &quot;close it&quot; not knowing about the piece&#39;s limits. Still it would be difficult to build a closing visor in Lego at this scale, so it is likely this is now th definitive version of Buzz Lightyear for the time being.</p>

<p><strong>Little Green Man</strong></p>

<p>Arguably the most controversial figure in this series, many FOL&#39;s have criticized it for featuring few changes from the previous 2010 version. This is my first version of this character, so I am not complaining; however other than updated printing there is not anything new in this figure. This might be a pass for those who own the 2010 Toy Story Sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Stitch</strong></p>

<p>As CGI began to dominate the animation industry; Disney began producing fewer films in classic hand drawn animation.&nbsp;<em>Lilo and Stitch&nbsp;</em>was one of the last hits of the era, being released in 2002. Stitch would become one of Disney&#39;s biggest icons, his merchandise including everything from plush animals to pins depicting Stitch dressed in the guise of Star War&#39;s Emperor Palpatine. It is no surprise that this hit character is included in this CMF line. His head piece is a unique and highly accurate mold, and the look of the figure looks like his &quot;Earth Dog&quot; look, representing the parts in the film were he is hiding his second set of arms and his alien spikes. However the use of short legs limits the ability to pose the figure and recreate the four legged guise used in a large part of the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Incredible (Bob Parr)</strong></p>

<p>The 2004 film&nbsp;<em>The Incredibles</em>&nbsp;was one of Pixar&#39;s last films made before being fully acquired by Disney in 2006. Mr. Incredible comes with dual molded legs and arms in Lego form, and a new hairpiece that shows balding. The red suit does look a bit plain in Lego form though. The figure comes with a new print on the classic 2x2 tile; that has a great super hero poster on it. One of my copies of this figure is the only printing error I have seen in my Disney CMF collection, a domino mask that is a bit &quot;smudged&quot; extending it higher than the correctly printed figure.</p>

<p><strong>Syndrome (Buddy Pine)</strong></p>

<p>The archenemy&nbsp;of Mr. Incredible, is highly detailed in Lego form with dual molded legs and arms, and Lego and arm printing. His blue eyes are a bit strange for a Lego figure, but complement the sinister look of the figure. His 2x2 tile is printed with controls for the Omnidroid, and will surely appear in many sci-fi&nbsp;MOCs yet to come. His hair piece is new, and he is a great looking figure.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I have never before felt the desire to collect a CMF line like I did with this one, and having them all in hand I am rather impressed. Despite some weaker figures, the final collection shines. This is an awesome collectible figure line; and I am hoping Lego does a second wave, since Disney has many&nbsp;characters that could translate well into Lego form! This is definitely a must buy series.</p>

"ShadowWolfHount","2023-02-07T03:22:56.473Z","Mickey's collection of friends","<p><strong>-STITCH-</strong></p>

<p>A nice beloved character to be lucky to get from the first packs of bags, for my case I got 3 of him. Having a&nbsp;head mould and simple printing with a nice touch of that fur on the chest.</p>

<p>Though I sadden that he wasn&#39;t paired&nbsp;with Lilo, which is strange to why as he and&nbsp;Maleficent are the only two that aren&#39;t paired.</p>

<p><strong>-MALEFICENT-</strong></p>

<p>A nicely&nbsp;accurate figure, though a find it doesn&#39;t need to cape aside the collar part but was nice to get. The headwear is a very cool&nbsp;looking piece and could be reuse outside the character for demon horns.</p>

<p><strong>-ALIEN &amp; BUZZ LIGHTYEAR-</strong></p>

<p>Return of Buzz Lightyear with more detail printing and a minifigure head rather than the <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/toy004/buzz-lightyear"">head mould</a> we got in 2010, we did get return of the bodywear pieces in the exact same prints. In which the Alien head mould have the same thing of reusing&nbsp;the same print.</p>

<p>A bit sad that Woody isn&#39;t in it to have more detail printing for his arm and legs, though you can do many things with&nbsp;multiple aliens and can change the&nbsp;duplicate Buzz head&nbsp;to make Star Command.</p>

<p>However, good thing Woody wasn&#39;t in it as year later we got <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Toy-Story/subtheme-Toy-Story-4"">Toy Story 4 sets</a>.</p>

<p>-ALADDIN AND GENIE-</p>

<p>A great pair choice with simple design and nice mould headwear, though it expected for them to be reused again in the future for the same characters in minidoll form.</p>

<p>The odd thing about the two is both of them having a&nbsp;Genie Lamp, it would be great to get Abu from one of them.&nbsp;Who know when we&#39;re getting that monkey.</p>

<p><strong>-ALICE AND CHESHIRE CAT-</strong></p>

<p>The first time we&#39;re getting&nbsp;Alice in Wonderland stuff, and in minifigure form first rather than minidoll.</p>

<p>Alice coming off as very doll like, could imagine the figure actually being used as a doll in a large room model. The&nbsp;accessories bring us new bottle and cookie with nice printing, could imagine the bottle being used for something else.</p>

<p>Cheshire Cat have nice moulded head that holds that creepy look. It&#39;s the first time we got the tail printed, with the&nbsp;tail is design could bring us more different kind of printing for this piece. The rest of the body I could see being used for PJs.</p>

<p><strong>-DAISY, DONALD, MINNIE &amp; MICKEY-</strong></p>

<p>Outside from Goody, we got all of Mickey and his friends in their iconic look, outside from Donald who been reused in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71040-1/Disney-Castle"">Disney Castle</a>&nbsp;(if he was in a very cheaper set, I would have been very annoyed).&nbsp;</p>

<p>They all have head moulds we would keep seeing again in the future with a pin hold on the top of their head to attach stuff into. Having this as the character of a hat/bow.</p>

<p>While we see these characters again, I&#39;m glade that they keep the outfit exclusive.</p>

<p><strong>-MR. INCREDIBLE &amp; SYNDROME-</strong></p>

<p>Sadly for this, Mr. Incredible was reused again years later that I wish they could try to keep this exclusive proof&nbsp;and went with his old costume from his Glory Days. But instead we got that costume in a printing.</p>

<p>Syndrome is a lot better compared with the detail on the arms and nice silver on the shoes. I love the hair and like with Kai&#39;s hair I wish they could be reused for some sort of fire.</p>

<p><strong>-PETER PAN &amp; CAPTAIN HOOK-</strong></p>

<p>Even though it shows Peter having silver dagger, they are actually gold, must have been change in the last second after already making all the official pictures.</p>

<p>Outside that the two have great design, Captain Hook having that big headwear that would be impossible not to detect in the blind bag.</p>

<p>We got&nbsp;tinkerbell in the Disney Castle set, but I wish Peter could have a statue of her, as this is also the first Peter Pan aside from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10526-1/Peter-Pan-s-Visit"">Duplo set.</a></p>

<p><strong>-ARIEL AND URSULA-</strong></p>

<p>The two bring us more of those fish legs for any demi minifigures, wishing that Ursula along with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71024-13/Hades"">Hades from series 2</a> legs could make a return in some way.</p>

<p>The printing and accessory are given are very nice, along with accrete hair. Even though Ariel&#39;s hair look fake looking, probably why they kept using the one from the minidoll for her and this hair remain CMF exclusive.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Outside of Mr. Incredible, this is a fine selection for the first series of Disney CMF, with many of the iconic characters.</p>

<p>However, aside from Mickey and Friends, I wish the Disney CMF was more focus on turning the Minidolls into Minifigures. Rather than character that we could see in sets as minifigures as we see with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/subtheme-Incredibles-2"">Incredibles</a> and Toy Story.</p>

<p>I very much recommend collecting these if you&#39;re a fan of Disney overall but suggest getting the sets variants of the minifigure character if they are cheaper than the CMF.</p>
