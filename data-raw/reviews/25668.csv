"BlueStation","2016-08-06T22:23:51.153Z","""Forgot About My New Toys.... Let's Go.""","<p>Summer 2016 marked the cinematic return of the Ghostbusters franchise, with a new story and new characters to bring us back into the world of proton packs, PKE meters, and paranormal comedy. Expanding on the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/tag-Ghostbusters"">recent releases</a> in the Ghostbusters theme, 75828 brings the key players of the new film and builds on past sets with upgraded designs.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a distinctive box with slime-soaked design and the orange striping seen on the new Ghostbusters&#39; uniforms. The front of the box depicts 3 of the Ghostbusters in action against Mayhem, the winged-demon/dragon ghost haunting the concert scene of the film. Holtzmann is seen pulling up the new Ecto-1 with Kevin alongside in his motorcycle - dubbed the &quot;Ecto-2&quot; in this set.</p>

<p>The back of the box features several angles of the new Ecto (a Cadillac hearse from the 1980s), along with many of the Ghostbusting accessories and equipment from the movie, and a possessed Kevin.</p>

<p>The instructions come in a single bound book (much appreciated!) and the first few pages feature images from the new film, breakdowns of all the characters and the new vehicles.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>New <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6158294"">2x2 round slide-shoes</a> feature the new Proton Pack designs printed with spot-on film accuracy. Combined with the new <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6156991"">black ingot pieces</a>, these proton packs are an even further upgrade from the superb previous packs from the standpoint of Lego accuracy/design.</p>

<p>The useful new <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6153264"">shaft w/knob</a> allows for construction of the Ghost Traps featured in the film. <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6131726"">Reddish-orange stick w/holders</a> are included to construct the PKE meter used by Abby in the film, and the spare parts in the set allowed construction of a second PKE meter to add to the equipment.</p>

<p>The <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4215618"">transparent 1x1 angular brick</a> was a new piece to me though has apparently been in use since 2010. It&#39;s unique application here made for the front lights of the Cadillac to look very realistic.</p>

<p>Printed parts such as the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6156951"">red &amp; gray striped 2x2 plate with bow</a>, the previously used <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6092269"">Ecto license plate</a>, and the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6092268"">plate with bow Ghostbusters logo</a> round out the impressive printed parts in the set. I don&#39;t plan to use this set as a parts pack, but you would have no shortage of interesting parts to utilize in Ghostbusters MOCs, a science lab, or who knows?</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Perhaps most impressive in this set are the minifigures. The quality of the minifigs in this release brings Lego Ghostbusters to a new level.</p>

<p>6 figures are included in total, with the 4 new Ghostbusters, their secretary Kevin, and the previously mentioned Mayhem.</p>

<p>Similarly to the original Ghostbusters designs, the torsos for the new team feature the character initials on the nametags. The printing is phenomenal, with every wrinkle, pocket, fold, and accessory brought to life. Each uniform features the orange stripes and arm printing with the GB logo. Subtle differences in how the uniforms are worn are shown on each torso: Patty&#39;s &quot;P&quot; necklace, Holtzmann&#39;s bandolier, Abby&#39;s collar hanging down. Erin and Holtzmann wear dual-molded leg pieces to show their black boots. The printing on these pieces feature additional cargo pockets, as does Abby&#39;s uniform; Patty&#39;s have side pockets. The details are film-accurate and lovingly reproduced here. This is where this set shines brightest.</p>

<p>Each character has a base/neutral emotion printed on one side of the face, and then an alternate print on the opposite side with more expression. Erin shows surprise, Abby has a huge smile, Patty grits her teeth, ready for a fight, and Holtzmann wears her distinctive yellow-lensed glasses. Abby and Holtzmann look the most like Melissa McCarthy and Kate McKinnon, but Erin and Patty come close too.</p>

<p>Aiding this film accuracy are three new tremendous hair pieces for Abby, Patty, and Holtzmann. Abby&#39;s simple brunette hair pulled back in a bun is reproduced here and will no doubt be easily applied into your MOCs, mixed-and-matched with other minifigures. But Patty and Holtzmann&#39;s pieces are where the set really goes above-and-beyond. These hair pieces are EXACTLY like the film. Holtzmann&#39;s sideswept-punk-mad scientist blonde style is not like anything I&#39;ve seen in Lego before, and perhaps more crucially, Patty&#39;s elaborate dreadlocked-updo represents some much-needed diversity in the Lego minifig world. I hope to continue to see new elements like these, which will be mixed-and-matched into new MOC creations and more and more reflect the world we actually live in!</p>

<p>The final two minifigures are Kevin and Mayhem. Kevin wears his own Ghostbusters jumpsuit, with a duct-taped &quot;Kevin&quot; written on the nametag (a hilarious detail!) and looks exactly like Chris Hemsworth in the film. The alternate facial expression shows him red-eyed and possessed, which while not entirely how he appears in the film, gets across the idea of his role in the third act and gives the set an additional playability element.</p>

<p>Mayhem is the only figure that may be considered a slight disappointment. Utilizing previous molded elements with new printing, the Lego designers are able to mostly capture the visual element of Mayhem (though far more red than I recalled from the green glow in the film). However the scale is not quite right. With this version at minifig size, it doesn&#39;t exactly get across the idea of Mayhem. In one of the film&#39;s memorable gags, he perches on Leslie Jones&#39; shoulders and his massive size is not reproduced here. Still he&#39;s an interesting figure providing a playable element to the set. It&#39;s a shame there is no attempt at reproducing Rowan&#39;s Ghost, or the terrifying Gertrude Aldridge ghost from early in the film - but the draw of this set is the new team.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>First up in the build are Kevin and Mayhem, and the remaining figures are built in different stages throughout - I love when a set is like that. It&#39;s like a bonus in each building stage.</p>

<p>All four proton packs are assembled at the beginning, and then Erin. Two Ghost traps are built to accompany her. The Ghost Trap looks pretty close to the film version, though the use of a round 1x1 trans-blue brick was confusing to me. I think the idea was that one trap is empty and one trap is full - but I don&#39;t recall seeing the trap look this way in the film. I may be mistaken in the intention here.</p>

<p>Kevin&#39;s Ecto-2 is assembled next and features a tiny GB logo sticker added to the front. Some kind of equipment is attached to the back for added detail.</p>

<p>The next stage brings us into the base for the Ecto-1. Abby is built at this point, along with the PKE meter and her &quot;Proton Glove,&quot; a melee-type offensive weapon Holtzmann built for her. This piece was already existing and does a good job getting across the idea of the Proton Glove.</p>

<p>The vehicle begins with some slight technic assembly which will mostly be used for the axle and wheels later. The base for the seating area is then built utilizing <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6092590"">brown 1x2 plates with knobs</a> - this will be one of the key design elements in allowing the 4 Ghostbusters to all sit in the vehicle (one of the key criticisms of the otherwise wonderful <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/21108-1/Ghostbusters-Ecto-1"">21108-1</a>).</p>

<p>Lots of <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4654580"">angular plates with studs</a> and similar elements are utilized in this stage to setup the exterior paneling. The front section of the car and the grill are assembled, and looks exactly like the Cadillac in the film. This sectioned is combined with the rest of the base as more of the structural support is laid out. This stage of the build can get a little tedious as it&#39;s all about lining up the right plates and studs to make sure everything is connecting evenly later.</p>

<p>Most of the bottom half is complete as we move onto the next stage. Holtzmann is assembled at this point, and features (I believe) some kind of proton gun that does not resemble what she uses in the film. I believe Erin used equipment like this, but Holtzmann&#39;s signature slow-motion scene features her taking out two pistol-sized proton guns and plowing through the ghostly onslaught. I went ahead and MOC&#39;d this with just the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/459926"">black tap</a> piece and a trans-red stud.</p>

<p>The hood of the car is finished and then the interior is fleshed out, with a dashboard sticker added showing some equipment and a radioactive symbol. The structures for the back supports and the sides are finished, with the red walls of the hearse section added. Large red stickers with additional detail are applied on these sides. The back bumper is added and disappointingly features two stickers to represent the brake lights. The back door is cleverly assembled with multiple hinging features and even a trans 1-2 brick for the window. This door swings out accurately to the film and has another sticker instructing cars to stay back. The tops of the hearse section supports are added to prepare for the top of the car.</p>

<p>We now come to one of my favorite features which are the functional front doors! While no side windows are included, the doors being able to swing open with the minifigures comfortably able to fit inside is a huge draw of this version over the original Ecto-1. It may inspire some easy MOCs on the original Ecto-1 to mimic this design. Utilizing simple clips, bows and slide-shoes, the doors open-and-shut with ease and excellent design.</p>

<p>The windshield is added and is intended to have side-stickers applied to resemble the red framing. I opted not to include these stickers as transparent stickers have been difficult to apply without some smudging or damage. I don&#39;t feel that it affected the look of the vehicle but apply at your own preferences.</p>

<p>We then move to the final stage of the build. Patty is assembled, and is given a dark blue toolbox. Her accessory in the film has been referred to as a &quot;ghost chipper&quot; and I am hoping that is not what the toolbox was supposed to represent, as it would not be close to an accurate look. I plan on MOCing together a version of her equipment instead.</p>

<p>The wheels and tires are added, utilizing red-on-white hubcaps which look great with the color palette established. The top of the hearse section is applied, with a small step-ladder on the side (similar to the original Ecto-1). We then begin the equipment section on the top of the car. Utilizing clips and gate/door pieces as a structural frame, we begin adding accessories meant to mimic the dangerous nuclear equipment Holtzmann added to the top. Caution stripes and radioactive stickers are applied here as well. I love builds like this as it shows you how easy it is to make the simplest bricks (studs, plates, clips) and make them look like complex scientific machinery. The roof is then attached to the car (easily removed and re-added to seat or remove the minifigs), antennae elements are added, and you&#39;re done.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is a spot-on recreation of the vehicle in the film. Utilizing new techniques for the doors, and maximizing the scale, Lego has found a way to have a more functional and playable Ecto-1 than ever before.</p>

<p>Few details are left out. The hearse section does not have a sliding element to allow for loading of equipment, and I also believe that the supports in this section are bulkier than necessary to hold up the roof. The reason why this is a problem is that you can&#39;t store much equipment in the back. The proton packs, however, do take up a lot of space especially with the whip/cord so it may not have been possible at this scale anyway.</p>

<p>Still, to fit all four Ghostbusters is a huge success of this design. And the more angular/squared shaping of the new 80s-era Cadillac is translated accurately here (just like the way <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/21108-1/Ghostbusters-Ecto-1"">21108-1</a> did it&#39;s best to mimic the curves of the 1959 Cadillac ambulance of the first film).</p>

<p>To pack this much detail and functionality at this density is the mark of a major success in Lego design.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Just like the 2016 movie itself, 75828 pays homage to it&#39;s film-and-Lego predecessors with all the Ghostbusting action, humor, equipment and vehicles you would expect.</p>

<p>The design of the main model is outstanding and I would easily consider it among the best sets of the year so far in terms of functionality and aesthetics.</p>

<p>Even so, the minifigures steal the show. The attention to detail and the subtlety of each character is brought out distinctively and entertainingly. The new Ghostbusters are hilarious and bring their own personaility to this franchise and it will be a lot of fun to create MOCs mixing them with the original crew.</p>

<p>I highly recommend this set for AFOLs and kids alike. There&#39;s plenty of playability and displayability.</p>

<p>I also highly recommend the film. Nothing quite matches the original film, which was lightning in a bottle - but this new crew and story bring life back into the Ghostbusters franchise and 75828 captures every ounce of it.</p>

It&rsquo;s not a bad set, unless you really hated the reboot movie, which might explain why this was such a hard set to sell and why it was found on shelves for quite such a long time after the fact, which is a real shame. This set actually looks quite good and despite what you may think of the movie, the car is always a nice model to have.</span></span></span></span></p>

The image on the front showcases the set quite nicely with a great looking action shot and a backdrop of the New York City streets. On the back we include a few shots, showing the vehicle, accessories and features highlighting what the vehicle can do. It is an exceptionally nice box design and looks great, just a shame there are no other sets to complement it.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s relatively decent, but the pages are all on a black background, this made it slightly harder to follow along with the build when darker colours were shown in use during the construction phase. I understand what they were going for in the design, but having all black pages with colorful images to show what you&rsquo;re doing doesn&rsquo;t work the best for the darker spectrum of colours LEGO employs in their sets. It&rsquo;s the same problem I had with the original LEGO Batman Theme.</span></span></span></span></p>

I mean sure there are a lot of useful parts in the set, but as a fan of Ghostbusters having access to some printed logo pieces is always a good thing in my book if you&rsquo;re looking to MOC something out of the Franchise.</span></span></span></span></p>

There is a lot of printed detailing on the torso and legs capturing the look of the jumpsuits worn in the film quite nicely. Her accessories include a version of the PKE Meter, something I believe was called the Ghost Shredder in the movie and a very nicely built proton pack with a nice printed element for the faraday cage on the back.</span></span></span></span></p>

Her Minifigure shares parts and detailing from the Erin, the differences in the torso are her name tag and a bandolier with what look like ghost grenades attached. Her proton pack is identical to the others in construction and appearance, her extra accessory is one of the Proton Pistols she used in the film, she includes dual-sided head with goggles and a determined expression on one side and a more neutral expression minus the goggles on the other.</span></span></span></span></p>

He doesn&rsquo;t include any accessories, but does include a dual-sided head which represents when he is possessed by Rowan in the movie. His hair piece is rather nice too with a very nicely detailed sculpt in a great light blonde colour. He features no dual-molding.</span></span></span></span></p>

He&rsquo;s got a nice bit of printing on the back of the gargoyle wing piece and the head of course, but it is a shame that they didn&rsquo;t have the final image to work with.

This too is a solid build and fundamentally very well executed. They&rsquo;ve improved considerably on the design of this new, modern interpretation of the Ghostbusters&rsquo; iconic vehicle, the only real problem is they have you leave the rear door open after building it, which can get in the way unless you just close it and ignore what LEGO told you to do. Placement of the sticker for the dashboard is also done here, which I feel is a step back considering most of the other details are printed elements.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 4: This final step of the build features Patty Tolan and a host of unusual equipment included on the top of the car. I think this makes it more cluttered than the original Ecto-1, but I suppose there&rsquo;s a lot of equipment Holtzmann wants to test out attached to the vehicle compared to Egon and Ray&rsquo;s ride. You&rsquo;ll also attach the tires here, which is a very creative way to attach them, but does require precise placement of two Technic axles for the tires to attach to. Overall a satisfying build.</span></span></span></span></p>

While the two vehicles share similar traits, this model includes several key upgrades, chief among them is the ability to fit all four Ghostbusters inside the car. The back door opens much nicer as well and allows you to place the Ghost Trapping gear inside. I would love to see them use this overall improved design to make an Ecto 1-A from Ghostbusters 2.</span></span></span></span></p>

The dashboard, side-detailing on the back of the car and the side-stripes found on the windshield are all stickers, naturally they would have been better as printed details, but alas it was not to be.</span></span></span></span></p>

Not much really to say about it, aside from the fact that I believe this is the first time we&rsquo;ve gotten the motorcycle chassis in white as I do not recall that colour being used previously. There&rsquo;s a few nice details to show Kevin&rsquo;s &lsquo;additions&rsquo; to the model to try and make it an official Ghostbuster vehicle.</span></span></span></span></p>

Is some of the criticism justified? Honestly I think there are some truths to some of the critiques on how things were handled, that being said, the film was still very fun and most of the good parts overrode the bad. To that end I&rsquo;m really impressed and glad that LEGO gave us this set, they honestly did not have to.</span></span></span></span></p>

The model is great, the Minifigures are very nicely put together and the accessories stand out as very nicely chosen. Strongly recommended for fans.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Tediousity","2017-07-04T19:08:47.417Z","Who ya gonna call?","<p>This is a great set. Let&#39;s go into details.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>Abby Yates: This figure looks startlingly like Melissa McCarthy. Her suit looks suitably baggy, and her initials are on it (of course). She comes with the fist from the movie: quite a good representation. She does not have dual-molded legs.</p>

<p>Patty Tolan: Huzzah! A black, female Lego figure! Finally! Seriously, I think the last one was Storm, back in 2014. That said, this figure is quite good. Looks sufficiently like Leslie Jones, and the hairpiece (custom-molded) is outstandingly detailed. Her legs are also not dual-molded.</p>

<p>Erin Gilbert: Erin...doesn&#39;t look too much like Erin. I think it&#39;s the hairpiece: her hair was down for most (if not all) of the movie, so seeing it up is a shock. Beyond that, she&#39;s fine. New head. Unlike the first two, her legs are dual-molded to represent boots.</p>

<p>Jillian Holtzmann: Beyond being (In my opinion) the greatest character in the movie, Holtzmann has a double-sided head: one side goggled and grimacing, the other un-goggled and smiling. She looks like Kate McKinnon. Her and Abby are some of the best representations of real people in Lego I&#39;ve ever seen. Her hair is custom-molded and beautifully sculpted. Her legs are also dual-molded.</p>

<p>Kevin...uh...we&#39;ll stick with Kevin: Kevin has a home-made suit with a piece of tape on his breast pocket with &quot;KEVIN&quot; scrawled on. He&#39;s got new-Superman&#39;s hair piece in blond (a different shade than Holtzmann&#39;s) and a dual-sided head: one side possessed, one not. He&#39;s pretty cool.</p>

<p>Mayhem: I honestly hadn&#39;t a clue that this was Mayhem. To me it looks nothing like Mayhem, but works well as a generic ghost and has some nice trans-black pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Build:</strong></p>

<p>This is a great set, despite its large number of stickers. Fortunately, the doors and bars on the sides of the car are not stickered, but just about everything else is, down to the tiny nuclear sign on the back of the roof. That said, it fits everything! Well, all the people. Everyone can fit comfortably inside the car, excepting Kevin, who uses his motorbike. The trunk opens and can fit all the accessories and one proton pack (if you&#39;re careful). Unfortunately, the others must be either left out or strapped to Kevin&#39;s bike (I did this).</p>

<p>The car itself is gloriously detailed, with some...<em>interesting </em>apparatus on top. It also includes four clear Erling bricks in the headlights, which are a rarity. The doors open (the front ones,anyway) and the interior steering-wheel-area is stickered with one large sticker showing something nuclear strapped to the passenger side of the dashboard. The rear lights are stickered, as are the bars on the sides of the windshield, the caution bar on the roof, and a warning sign on the trunk.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>Despite the huge numbers of stickers, this is a great set for anyone looking to expand their Ghostbusting repertoire or bring some diversity to their city. At a price point of $59.99, it&#39;s leaning on the lightly overpriced side of things but I&#39;d still recommend it without a doubt.</p>
