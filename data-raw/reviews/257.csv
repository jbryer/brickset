"Jedd_the_Jedi","2006-07-07T04:34:01Z","A flight of fancy, but a great set anyway","Although this by no means resembles an actual gimbal rig used in movie studios, it looks interesting and amusing, with the dino head formed beautifully, and mostly by regular bricks. The kitten and the baby dinosaur are cute touches too. I like the turnstile and the great grip minifig. I also enjoyed the alternate model of a juncle boat, which I tried and loved.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Smallsam99","2008-04-26T14:36:46.857Z","Dino Head is Huge!","This set is a old set from about 2002. I got it as a present and it's good! The set has a baby dino and a rare cat. I includes a grip and girl johnny minifig. The dino head is very cool and looks menicing. If you put new spikes in the place of the round cone pieces it looks better. It also could be used to eat minifigs and is built to scale. The set altogether is good and is a deal for 5-10 dollars. I rate the set about a 7.5/10 and it has some uses!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"rabk295","2008-07-18T19:53:25.857Z"," Uh... Well... about this set.....","This is a good idea for a set, but there is really no point to this set and there is really nothing you can do with it except pretend it's a real dinosaur or use the pieces for something else. All-in-All, I don't think this set is worth the money.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"LEGOParadise","2010-12-04T14:44:17.95Z","Dinosaur=ROAR!  Dinosaur Head/Half of Dinosaur=RO...","<p>I purchased this set off Amazon.com for around £10, but decided it would be worth the money a bit more if it cost £7 or £8. Unfortunatly, Brickset&nbsp;does not&nbsp;hold&nbsp;the original retail price of Dino Head Attack for me to compare the value. Anyway, on to the review...</p>
<p><strong>Minifigures: 8/10</strong></p>
<p>There are two minifigures in this set: a&nbsp;female actor and a Grip cameraman. The actor or explorer, has a very suspiscious similarity to the Adventurers&nbsp;"" Pippin Reed "" minifigure. Her torso is decorated with pockets, a camera, a pen, and a belt. The Grip cameraman has a microphone-headset printed on his head, an ID badge, screwdriver and sunglasses on his torso and he wears blue jeans&nbsp;with a matching baseball cap.</p>
<p><strong>Dino Head: 10/10</strong></p>
<p>Considering the variety of bricks available in 2001, LEGO designed a pretty good dinosaur head. The Technic arm allows you to control the dino&nbsp;without touching the head allowing you to make life-like movements, however, this feature does not prove very useful when making stop-motion films, the purpose LEGO studios was designed for. The cameraman can sit in the raised controls platform to pretend to operate the dinosaur head.</p>
<p><strong>Cool Pieces: 9/10</strong></p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Baby dinosaur brick</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> White cat</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Green boat-front piece</p>
<p><strong>4. </strong>Black turntable brick</p>
<p><strong>5. </strong>Cameraman's torso</p>
<p><strong>6. </strong>Rare white chair</p>
<p><strong>Overall: 8/10</strong></p>
<p>The dino head and the minifigures are both very good but there is still room for improvement. Overall, (I allways seem to say that at the end of my reviews) this is a good set with cool minifigs and&nbsp;lots of green bricks, it offers good playability and a sturdy model in the end result.Get it while its still a reasonable price! Hope you found my review helpful!</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,3

<p>Pros: pippin reed, grip, the green boat hull, the Dino cub, 1x2 green&nbsp; half pyramid,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons: my copy was missing a piece but the piece was easy to replace.</p>
