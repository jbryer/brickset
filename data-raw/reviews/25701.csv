"Galaxy12_Import","2019-10-16T00:20:33.28Z","All the Elements of a Brick-Built Universe","<p>LEGO Space ties the reader into the story within the first few pages by presenting a LEGO version of humankind&#39;s current reach toward&nbsp;the stars. Within a century or so that &quot;small step for a man&quot; has led to orderly space stations within our solar system and a professional Federation at the helm of a golden age of Space Exploration. The story arc brings forth nostalgia of the now-classic <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terran_Trade_Authority"">Stewart Cowley era</a>; think&nbsp;<em>Great Space Battles</em>&nbsp;with a historically-minded LEGO flavor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The plot is occasionally sprinkled with short building instructions for the smaller models featured in the book, allowing readers with a decent collection to make their own copies of the impressive and compact builds that grace the pages. Edge-to-edge full color pictures allow the characters and spaceships to come to life, brick-built landscaping used where possible and expansive star fields&nbsp;offering the perfect backdrop to the larger structures.</p>

<p>Much LEGO design and storytelling effort has gone into this work of optimistic fiction, providing a&nbsp;short but fulfilling read for a rainy day. The intersection of LEGO and space exploration opens an endless&nbsp;platform for any who care to write within it; Reid and Goddard have provided a volume that covers lightyears and paves the way for your very own minifigure cadets to find their place in the cosmos.</p>

"ra226","2022-06-26T06:39:52.873Z","Fun, Inspirational, maybe a little immature--but in the best way!","<p>Lego Space: Building the Future tells an imagined, optimistic future-history (beginning with real history) of human space exploration, all via the medium of Lego.&nbsp; The book is composed of dozens of models and full vignettes, representing thousands of hours of design and building.&nbsp; It tells the story of Sputnik, the first steps on the moon, the first lunar base, expansion to the outer planets...&nbsp; as well as the sinister origins of the Blacktron empire under Lord Kazak and mankind&#39;s first expansion beyond our own star.</p>

<p>The stories and brief write-ups of the individual ships, ground vehicles, and robots all remind me of something I might have written when I was a late teen.&nbsp; In that respect, they&#39;re a bit immature, but also absolutely endearing and as an AFOL, reading this book brought me back to those times.&nbsp; The authors tie together the Classic Space, Ice Planet, Blacktron, Space Police, and Futuron themes into a single, cohesive story line.</p>

<p>The models are mostly pretty great, and either direct re-imaginings of real, classic models, or evolutions of those classics, following a &quot;form first&quot; philosophy.&nbsp; One of my favorite models was a smaller model inspired by #918 early in the book, but stripped-down, with several panels missing undergoing repairs.&nbsp; Then of course there&#39;s the famous Exosuit, which has its origins in the work of these authors and eventually became the fantastic Ideas set #21109.</p>

<p>With the recently launched (pardon the pun!) #10497 and the less-recent (but still later than this book) #70816 Benny&#39;s Spaceship, the designs can feel a bit over-detailed, but for the most part, they still look very good.&nbsp; A few are a bit bland in terms of color (one ship is almost completely grey and could have used a bit of dark grey here and there).</p>

<h3>Good</h3>

<ul>
	<li>It&#39;s Classic Space (re-imagined)--what&#39;s not to love??</li>
	<li>Tons of inspirational models, and a story to tie them all together</li>
	<li>Also offers building instructions for a few of them</li>
	<li>Undeniably nostalgic.&nbsp; Did I mention it&#39;s Classic Space?</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bad</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The models are excellent but already a bit dated.&nbsp; Book was published even before the first Lego Movie, and is nearly a decade behind in recently introduced parts.</li>
	<li>Writing is a bit immature at times--every ship is &quot;fast for its size&quot; and &quot;a favorite among pilots&quot; etc--but I found this charming (and reminiscent of my own writing style as a teen building and documenting my own creations).</li>
	<li>The building instructions cover only the smaller, more basic sets.&nbsp; Would have been nice to get instructions for a few of the bigger models like the LL-497, etc.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The designs tend to favor form over function--the large ship on the cover, for instance, looks like it might carry a large cargo module, but that&#39;s not the case.&nbsp; Still, this to me is just part of the style.</li>
</ul>

<p>I had heard about this book back when it was published, and then forgotten about it until I saw it at the local library recently.&nbsp; I checked it out, and it was pretty much what I expected.&nbsp; A fun journey through the imaginations of some very talented builders.&nbsp; It&#39;s absolutely worth having a look through, and really gives you that care-free feeling of making up stories with your creations as a kid.&nbsp; Which is exactly what Classic Space has always been about.</p>
