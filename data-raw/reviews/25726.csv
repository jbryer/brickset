<p>The set portrays a scene more typical of an Australian summer Christmas, a banana lounge, esky&nbsp;(drink cooler) and sun umbrella, with Santa sucking on a popsicle.</p>

<p>They all sit on a 6 x 6 dark tan plate, representing a sandy beach.</p>

<p>There is not a lot of playability with this set, but it makes a really cool little display ornament to adorn the mantle piece around Christmas time.</p>
