I&#39;m pretty sure i built the display correct. Or, maybe it is like this intentionally to show the ship banked slightly. I don&#39;t know.&nbsp; What i do know is that unless you are displaying this thing at eye level... It blocks your view of the title card stand as well as the minifigs&nbsp;that come with it (assuming you choose to display them on the stand as shown).&nbsp; To me, that kind of detracts from the whole scheme of the UCS theme.&nbsp; SO... I had to do a little correcting on my own and modified the display slightly so that it didn&#39;t lean.&nbsp; Yet still it just doesn&#39;t stand out like some of the other UCS sets.</p>

<p>That being said.&nbsp; It&#39;s still a must have.&nbsp; It appears to be very movie accurate and very well detailed. Aside from the back covers that go over the canons.&nbsp; I&#39;m pretty sure the movie version shows that cover going straight across the back (not indented the way this set is).&nbsp; But to me, that&#39;s very minor.&nbsp; The scale is fine with me. The bigger and more detailed the better as far as i am concerned. But don&#39;t try putting your minifigs in the cockpit.&nbsp; It&#39;ll look like the kids when they sit in the front seat behind the wheel of their parents Ford Expedition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build&nbsp;was fun and interesting as usual. Took me the better part of a saturday to put together.&nbsp; I will say this tho.... In most reviews that i watch on youtube of star wars lego sets... Most reviewers tend to not like stickers too much.&nbsp; With this set i finally joined that crowd. Too many stickers.</p>
