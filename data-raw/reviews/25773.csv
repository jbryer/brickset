However, it was pretty lame and very repetitive, and I was cringing when I was supposed to be laughing. In the end, I was glad to have finished it, and I&#39;m now going to sell it on eBay to try to get my money back! The book is very short and doesn&#39;t even offer an hour of reading, so it&#39;s not really worth the money, and if you are a female, prepare to be offended because this book&nbsp;seems to think&nbsp;that AFOL can only be men! I&#39;m a male and even I was annoyed by the obvious sexism in this book. The final negative point is that there are also spelling mistakes and grammar mistakes in the book...how did this get past the publisher?!</p>

<p>Overall? I definitely wouldn&#39;t recommend it.</p>
