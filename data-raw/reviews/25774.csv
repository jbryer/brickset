<p>The book takes an&nbsp;in-depth look into&nbsp;how the first two CEO&nbsp;outside the Christiansen family led the company. One taking a top-down approach and the other taking a collaborative approach to leadership. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Along the way, you learn about the products that worked and the products that did not. &nbsp;It was under&nbsp;J&oslash;rgen Vig Knudstorp&#39;s leadership when the company started seeking input from the community on&nbsp;products and this is when you see the growth of LEGO. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This book&nbsp;provides lessons learned from a company that was on the verge of bankruptcy while giving you a history of LEGO and insight into the future of this worldwide company. This is a great read and insightful! &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
