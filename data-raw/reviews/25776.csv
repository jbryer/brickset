"Sebastian","2016-04-17T20:43:50.167Z","Good encore to the Ideas birds set","<p><font face=""Helvetica"" size=""3"">Normally I don&#39;t buy many books&nbsp;about Lego published by other AFOLS as there are countless pictures of breathtaking Mocs for free on the Internet and I don&#39;t really like to replicate somebody else&#39;s work using their instructions. To me, this book is an exception as it can be seen as a continuation of the&nbsp;IDEAS birds set (which I liked)&nbsp;and therefore has a semi-official touch.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Helvetica"" size=""3"">The book includes a good assortment of birds both in terms of colour and (part-) size. Again, Poulsom chose a variety of&nbsp; birds (15)&nbsp;from different parts of the&nbsp;world. The book has a soft cover but appears to be sturdy even after flipping the pages&nbsp;many times. The font is easily readable and seems appropriate for that volume. Under artificial light the instructions are sometimes a bit hazy, especially if red parts are shown.&nbsp;The photographs of the birds both in Lego form and in nature are very clear, however I would have liked some more&nbsp; shots of the birds in the wild as the summarising double page in the back of the book&nbsp;really is the only one on which you see them in real life.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Helvetica"" size=""3"">It&#39;s really fun turning the pages and to see what&#39;s coming next and I immediately wanted to start building. When the first picture of the book appeared last year my attention was immediately drawn to the red-capped robin chat on the cover page so it&#39;s no surprise I built that first. I started bricklinking some of the parts I was missing a couple of&nbsp;weeks ago as I had come by a preview page of the parts list. Didn&#39;t manage to get all the orange parts in the&nbsp;correct size but these could easily be substituted by similar parts of the same colour. It doesn&#39;t bother me that much as it&#39;s not an official set anyway. By the way this also applies to most of the other birds, especially for the parts used in the interior without noticing that anything is different. Having completed the one bird now, I think all of the waiting and BL ordering was worthwhile as&nbsp;it really is an elegant little thing and looks good as a home decoration next to a flower or plant.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Helvetica"" size=""3"">I decided to build only four of the birds, namely the ones&nbsp;I like most and even that is quite a project. I probably&nbsp;have half of the parts for each bird in my collection so it will be quite an effort to&nbsp;get the rest&nbsp;from bricklink even for the remaining three. The book will definitely keep me busy Lego-wise for a long time so value for money is totally on hand. Some parts are hard to come by on bricklink which is a bit of a nuisance. I won&#39;t tell here&nbsp;which ones&nbsp;and I hope prices for them won&#39;t rise dramatically as many people want to buy them because of the book. Another aspect&nbsp;I considered when deciding which birds I wanted to build is the fact that &quot;illegal&quot; building steps are used&nbsp;in some of&nbsp;the birds. This occurs in some of the SNOT connections and especially in the wing designs. I don&#39;t like it and this is a knock-out criterion for me.</font></p>

<p><font face=""Helvetica"" size=""3"">Conclusively I have to say that the birds project in general has made me more aware of these animals in my environment. It&#39;s a good thing to focus and enjoy the moment when walking outside,&nbsp;I guess and it&#39;s cool to transfer this to the living-room. If you liked the IDEAS project I totally recommend the book.&nbsp;</font></p>
