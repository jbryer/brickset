I was interested in it since it was cheap enough for me to buy at the time and it wat LEGO. It was also the first time that I&nbsp;got the 40-tooth gears so I was interested to see what it was all about.</p>

<p>The set consists of 112 parts according to <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?B=9781591747697&amp;name=Crazy%20Action%20Contraptions%20Book%20(Klutz)%20Vol.%202&amp;category=%5BIdea%20Book%5D#T=S&amp;O={%22iconly%22:0}"">Bricklink</a>. Depending on the book you buy, some of the parts that should be black will be dark-gray and some parts that should be light-gray&nbsp;will be black, so expect some variation if you pick this up (Bricklink&nbsp;also says that this book came out in 2008 while Brickset says that it came out in 2010, so there is some&nbsp;conflicting information). There are also some rubber bands included and a couple of o-rings for the larger tires. The rubber bands do snap relatively easily compared to other rubber bands so be carful when using&nbsp;them.</p>

<p>Al the builds are unique and fun to build. my personal favorites&nbsp;are the main car shown on the front of the book, the noise maker,&nbsp;and the grabber arm. There are a total of 16 builds that you can make and the instructions are included in the book. Following&nbsp;the true spirit of LEGO, the book also encourages you to create your own contraptions using the included pieces.</p>

<p>Overall this is a fun little book that also comes with come fun parts and I think that LEGO should make more books like this in the future. Kids should love it and adults may also enjoy the neat little builds. I have seen these still being sold in some stores, so if you see one you should pick it up and give it a try.</p>
