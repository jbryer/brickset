Comes with a cameraman and an adventurer, along with a scorpion and a 'skull' head.  I really liked this set because it came with enough pieces to make some nice alternative models.  Overall, a good selection of pieces make this set a good one.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-08T18:32:01Z","Yea!","GreatGreat little set. I like it because it has a great special effect. Johnny Thunder figs are always welcome in my LEGO collectIon, as well. I got this at Stonecrest Book AndTOy last week for $12.50. A little pricey, but well worth the $$$$$$$. Good camera, too.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-05T22:41:35Z","Great source of parts!","This is one of my favorite sets in the Studios line, mainly because it has Johnny Thunder! The main feature of this set is very fun (Very... Indiana Jones-ish...). It's also a great source of minfig acceories, such as the ruby, the pistol, and the camera. If you ever find this set at a store, I suggest you buy it!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2006-07-03T01:57:59Z","Just like a real movie set!","This set is loads of fun, and is a pretty good representation of how a real action movie set works, with Johnny Thunder as a great action hero mascot. the tumbling tiles are very fun, but would be better if constructed higher above the ground. That way Johnny will have some way to fall. The camera rig is okay, though not as impressive as the camera setup in the &quot;cameraman&quot; set.

Very satisfactory overall.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"deluckybrick","2007-07-23T17:41:52.5Z","Very fun and engaging set! ! ! ! ","This set was my first moviemaking set, and boy, did it live up to my expectations!  The set is sooo fun to play with (I would put the guy on the floor thing, pull out the panel, and WHAM!)!  Definitely worthe any money you pay for it, the set also has a cool cameraman.  As if that werent enough, it also has a ruby, which are hard to come by these days.

Very good set overall.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-19T11:04:22.82Z","LEGO Studios - Temple of Gloom Review","This set reminds me of set 7411 (Tygurah's Roar) from the LEGO Adventurers (Orient Expedition) theme. This set has the same play feature where you can slide a floor away and then the other plates on the top will fall on the ground. This is the only play feature we get in this scene but we also get a skull, a stand for the camera and a translucent red gem. For some reason we get another Johnny Thunder minifig. I know that he's a popular character but I think he's in too many sets. We also get a cameraman who controls the camera.<br><br>The built of this set is very easy and the model is very sturdy too. You also won't have to complain about stickers. It's a cool and fun set to have.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T12:26:49.623Z","Studios... Not For Everyone","<p>My first ever review of a Lego set, telling others what I think of the set. I figured I'd go numerical order so my first review on Brickset is a review for set #1355 Temple of Gloom. Now I am going to be perfectly honest, the Studios theme of Lego has always interested me, not because it allows you to make movies with the CD-Rom stuff, but because it represents something that every Lego collection should at least have one of. Hollywood Movie Making.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am a huge fan of films in general so when I first discovered the Studios theme of Lego I wanted it all, I wanted to add them to my City display as part of the movie making studio area. Where all the magic happens. So I started off small.</p>
<p>This set is a nice set for what you get, two figures, an actor (Represented by Johnny Thunder) and the cameraman who films all the action. I'd have to say that this is a stunt shoot (at least in my Lego Universe) due to the gimmick of dropping the floor out from under the Hero.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will admit though that not everyone will enjoy the set. It's fairly basic, with one tiny 'set' and a camera for the cameraman to film the 'stunt/action'. You get two mini-figures, a skull and a scorpion, plus of course the prize. A red jewel. Lego however is all about imagination and using what you have to build something more. Even though the gimmic can get old after the ten millionth time, you could always come up with something else with the parts supplied.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But if you're like me and you want to make a Movie Studio for your Lego City, then all you need is a couple Studios sets and you can do anything you want. The Cameraman included with the set could even be used to film City sets in action, such as the Police Officers chasing after the Crooks, or if like me you enjoy mixing up your themes, Brickbeard the Pirate invading Fort Legoredo for the Gold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rate this set overall with a four, I know a lot of reviewers do the whole pros and cons things, but I can't seriously find fault with my Lego sets so I forgo that particular aspect of reviewing. If you're thinking of expanding into the Studios theme I strongly recommend testing the waters out with one of the smaller sets before going for the larger stuff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this set makes a perfect opening.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,3
