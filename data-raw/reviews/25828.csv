"Mr__Thrawn","2019-01-01T19:22:52.57Z","The Essential Book for Serious LEGO Fans","<p>As a kid, I had THE LEGO BOOK, LEGO&rsquo;s 2008 compendium of interesting facts and photos. Then came this book, in 2015. I was immediately interested, as DK had asked the Brickset community which sets they should include, and I was pleased to see that one of my recommendations had made the front cover. I got the book for Christmas, and found it excellent. Whereas THE LEGO BOOK lacked depth and coverage of the pre-2000s&nbsp;themes, GREAT LEGO SETS included sets from as early as 1955! The book is really a great look at the evolution of LEGO through the years, beginning with Town Plan and ending with Elves. The only bad thing about this book is that it makes me want to spend hundreds of dollars on vintage LEGO!</p>

The book itself is superb, going through so much detailed lego history, with lots of insight into how and why certain sets are made. Who made the sets. and their popularity and affect on buyers. A must have for someone interested in older legos</p>
