<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The zombie minifigure is top notch. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s Chinese plastic (eat your heart out, Huw), and the back of the legs weren&#39;t cracked, as sometimes happens when minifigures are assembled.</p>

<h3>The read</h3>

<p>(I scored readability as playability, to the left)</p>

<p>Each page has a large picture of one minifigure, an intro to that figure (2 or 3 sentences), and 3-4 fun facts about the minifigure. Some pages also include references to similar minifigures. The minifigures chosen seemed kind of random. A lot aren&#39;t what I&#39;d call iconic, but most of them aren&#39;t obscure either. Each minifigure was given a rarity rating, which was totally arbitrary. It ranged from 1 (most common) to 5 (rarest). Most figures were 2 or 3. Some ratings seemed wildly inaccurate. For example, chrome C-3PO&nbsp;and Ogel&#39;s&nbsp;head minions from Alpha Team were both rated 4.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>At the full price, this book isn&#39;t worth it. I wouldn&#39;t pay more than about $7 for it. The minifigure is great, but the book itself isn&#39;t anything special.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-11-16T18:09:34.19Z","Another Zombie for your army of Undead","<p><strong>I Love That Minifigure: </strong>Yet another DK Publishing LEGO book with an exclusive Minifigure. DK seems to make two to three of these each year, and all of them are either for a specific Theme or in the case of this title a specific aspect of LEGO that many fans can enjoy. From building inspirations to Minifigures and their history you&rsquo;ll find a book for everything. We&rsquo;ll go over all of the standard observation points and then give an overall thought on this title.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>The front cover has a large word balloon for the title and the letter A is a plastic window bubble to see the exclusive figure. All around it are shots of Minifigures running the gamut of the history of the Minifigure. The back cover carries this visual design and it works well, you can see more of the Minifigures as the writing has been reduced in size.</p>

<p>The page design for the book is pretty good too, with large shots of each Minifigure for each page and fun facts, overall the design is standard by this point.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Zombie Skateboarder: This is a pretty interesting bonus Minifigure. Celebrating Minifigures and the CMF series in general it would seem as this guy, right down to the print, is a faithful recreation of the Series 1 Skateboarder, if he was bitten by a zombie and turned into one.</p>

<p>His legs have torn open knees revealing dead flesh underneath and includes some nice jeans print, and his torso, while single sided, looks just like the sweatshirt he wore back when he was alive. The difference of course being the ratty look and the fact that he now has a skull and crossbones on the front with dead eyes. Even the single-sided facial print is very well received, with the same impressive smile and a pair of spooky red eyes sticking out from under that mop of unruly hair. He includes a blue skateboard piece as an accessory.</p>

<p>All-in-all a really great looking Minifigure and a great addition to your Halloween/Monster Fighter minifig collections.</p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>

<p>208 Pages of Minifigure Madness, that&rsquo;s basically what you&rsquo;re getting here. And the Minifigures run the gamut of Themes and Eras broken up through Eleven Chapters. It&rsquo;s interesting to read honestly and fun to see just how many of these Minifigures you have in your collection. DK has selected a Minifigure from pretty much every Theme with few exceptions, you&rsquo;ll find Town, Pirates, Classic Castle, Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, Ideas and many more.</p>

<p>Each chapter groups the Minifigures of a certain type, there seems to be some odd choices of some of the characters though, like having Super Heroes and Super Villains in the same chapter that has nothing to do with Super Heroics. There is also a lot of Star Wars content, twenty-four pages worth to be exact which is something you&rsquo;ll enjoy or find repetitive due to the fact that many of these Minifigures are also found in the Character Encyclopedia. In fact Boba Fett has three pages scattered through this book showcasing three unique versions of his Minifigure.</p>

<p>I personally enjoy this, there are some write ups on Minifigures that are very rare, stuff you probably won&rsquo;t have seen unless you were present for their giveaways. Such as First LEGO League and Fan Weekend. Overall the contents seem well thought out, despite the repetitive nature of the Star Wars choices, and there&rsquo;s even a page dedicated to Sheldon Cooper from Ideas Big Bang Theory.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Personally I&rsquo;m really impressed by this book. It gets a tad repetitive due to the nature of including far too many licensed character pages for my liking when classic Minifigure eras are pretty much minimal, however for what&rsquo;s here it&rsquo;s a decent enough title with what you&rsquo;re used to from DK publishing as far as this style of book is concerned. The inclusion of a zombie version of the Series 1 CMF is fairly ingenious and I&rsquo;d say really brings this book up in my estimation as a recommendation goes. I&rsquo;d say pick it up, the fans of the Minifigure have yet another fun little book to read through and older collectors will enjoy the bonus figure here as a unique reinterpretation of an older Minifigure from the CMF line.</p>

"Red_Five2","2017-02-14T08:02:24.157Z","Cool dude!","<p>I got this book at Christmas from my Mum and Dad. This includes cool minifigures and there status.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifig:&nbsp;</strong>First of all, there is black hair. The face is grey with red eyes. The torso has a skull with some rips in his jacket. Finally, he has blue legs with rips again. The accessory is a blue skateboard which could be a reference to the skateboarder in Series 2.</p>

"J14T14","2020-09-04T18:35:16.737Z","I Love That Nerdy Book","<p>I love random trivia, so this book was an instant interest to me as it goes through some cool minifigures from LEGO&#39;s history. The exclusive minifigue was also interesting and drew me into this book</p>

<p><strong>The Book</strong></p>

<p>The book is full of high-quality pictures of many cool, rememberable, and rare minifigures from throughout LEGO&#39;s history. Each minifigure had some information on it as well as a rating from one to five minifigure-heads on how rare it is (though some ratings they give are debatable as some rated a 4 cost less and are easier to get on the secondary market than some figures rated a 2). This book is good for those of you who love random trivia on LEGO and also want to see a couple of rare figures that most people don&#39;t know about since they almost never show up for sale online or at conventions.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The minifigure in this book was a pretty cool inclusion. It is a vombified version of&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8683-6/Skater"">8683-6</a>&nbsp;Skater from Collectable Minifigure Series 1. While he has the same hairpiece and skateboard, he has an exclusive head and torso print that have some cool, and some funny jokes about how he is now a zombie (he has the same smirk and the eyes on the skull on his torso are now &quot;X&quot; s instead of being open). One cool upgrade is that this minifigure now has some cool ripped-jean printing in his legs while the original minifure has unprinted legs. This minifigure is a great continuation of this character&#39;s story and is a cool addition to any LEGO fan&#39;s&nbsp;collection.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This book is a great addition to anyone&#39;s collection. The book is a great source of information and the minifigure is pretty cool to have. I would highly recommend this book to any fan of LEGO.</p>
