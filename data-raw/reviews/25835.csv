<p>The book consists of pictures of LEGO Star Wars sets and minifigures in cool scenarios that look like they were taken directly out of a fun and sillier version of the Star Wars universe. It is really cool and I love the idea. The photographer is defiantly talented at capturing these moments and making them look as realistic as possible.</p>

<p>I have been inspired by this book and I have taken pictures of some of my LEGO Star Wars sets in a similar way and posted them to my Brixtar account along with my own creations.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great book and it is really inspiring. Some people may be disappointed that there is no exclusive minifigure or build included, but that is okay. This book is so good that it doesn&#39;t need any of that. It is a great book that is capable of inspiring people without any extra perks.</p>
