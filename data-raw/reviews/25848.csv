"penguin3332","2016-08-22T06:32:45.28Z","A Castle That Looks Good From Every Angle!","<p>Ever since I visited the grand Neuschwanstein Castle, I have found the Romanesque-revival palaces to be very interesting. So it is not surprising that when LEGO created&nbsp;a set based on Disney&#39;s Cinderella&#39;s Castle (which takes inspiration indirectly from Neuschwanstein Castle), I was very excited for its release. I knew that a fairytale castle could never fully be replicated in a smaller set (&lt;$200), so I was even more pleased when the Disney Castle turned out to be a large, $350 set.</p>

<p>I must admit, I am not a huge Disney fan, I have never been to Disney World (or Land) and I have only seen a few of the movies referenced by this set,&nbsp;so my comments on accuracy to the castle&nbsp;are confined to the pictures I have found on the internet.&nbsp;With that in mind, this review will look at the Cinderella&#39;s Castle from the view of a LEGO&nbsp;fan&nbsp;who happens to really enjoy the style of architecture that the castle is built in.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is appropriately gorgeous, with the castle easily distinguishable from the nighttime background due to the castle&#39;s prominent use of light bluish&nbsp;grey, tan, and white. Fireworks surround the castle recreating the fireworks show that happens every night at Disney World. The box itself is similar in size to the box for the&nbsp;Ghostbusters&#39; Firehouse, and about 2/3 the size of the Death Star box. The sides are mostly blank with a small inset showing the same image as the front of the box and the five included minifigures are displayed on the top. As expected, the back of the box showcases the back of the castle in detail with other insets for showing the minifigures interacting with the scenes contained within the castle.</p>

<p>Inside the box is a second, smaller&nbsp;box which holds about half of the bags for the set. The box seems to have been added more for structure than for organization as the bags contained within were in no discernable order, with some of the same numbers being both inside and outside of the smaller box. The instructions are a single 492 page perfect-bound booklet that comes wrapped in its own bag (no cardboard). For larger sections of the model where it might be difficult to find the added pieces, the pieces are outlined in red. I only had a slight trouble differentiating between tan and dark tan for one step, but otherwise the instructions are very clear and easy to understand.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As&nbsp;expected, this set has a large and broad collection of white, tan, and light bluish grey elements. In addition, the castle contains a large amount of&nbsp;slopes and cones&nbsp;in dark blue; several of which are new in that color. The quantity of parts is very substantial because there is a good variety of larger and smaller elements which allows the castle to reach a substantial height, but still maintain excellent detailing.</p>

<p>While this set contains a large amount of elements (4080 to be exact), only a smaller portion of the set is basic bricks. This makes this castle an excellent parts pack for people looking to add details to a castle or people who would like to build tall towers, but a poor set to start with to try and make a more traditional, sprawling castle. For a builder that already has a number of more basic bricks in his/her collection, this set contains a number of exciting newer elements in a variety of colors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are 13 elements in new colors:</p>

<p>Also included in this set are a number of new printed elements including a&nbsp;target (on a White 2 x 2 Round Tile), a clock face (on a Reddish-Brown 2 x 2 Round Tile), a clock face (on a White 4 x 4 Dish), a wall pattern (on a White 1 x 6 x 5 Wall Panel), an &quot;Empire Biscuit&quot; (on a Medium Nougat&nbsp;1 x 1 Round Tile), bedpost decorations (on a Reddish-Brown Unikitty&nbsp;Tail), and the White 1 x 2 Tile and Reddish-Brown Book Cover&nbsp;printed with fairytale decorations.</p>

<p>Of course, very few sets are without a sticker sheet, and this set is no exception. However, given the price of the set, the sticker sheet is minimal. The sheet contains 17 stickers printed on a metallic backing. 3 are used for the shields, one for Disney&#39;s crest (on a White 2 x 2 Tile) above the gateway, one for the Magic Mirror, and 6 of each type of brick detailing. All of the stickers seem to be of good quality&nbsp;and are not likely to peel over time.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>All of the five included minifigures are superbly detailed. In fact, some of the some of the minifigures (Minnie Mouse) have some of the most detail that I have seen on a minifigure. My thoughts on each of the minifigures are shown below in the order that they appear in the build:</p>

<p>Mickey Mouse looks almost identical to the costume in the park;&nbsp;the minifgure has his large yellow boy tie, his white vest, red pants with white polka dots, black shoes, and black jacket. The minifigure even includes a black pinstripe running down the side of the red legs and a new cloth element to represent his coat-tails. While the head may be the same as the Disney Minifigures version, it still is a great sculpt that accurately represents the head of Mickey Mouse. Strangely enough, Mickey does not have any back printing, although given the look of his suit jacket, it is unlikely that there would be much detail to add.</p>

<p>Minnie Mouse is one of the most detailed minifigures that I have ever seen. the minifigure has here park accurate red dress with white polka dots, red bow with white polka dots, and even yellow shoes printed on her dual moulded legs. Her arms are dual moulded in red and black to get the short sleeves of the dress and have a printed white cuff line. Minnie&#39;s head sculpt is accurate too with great printed eyelashes.</p>

<p>Donald Duck is the exact same minifigure as the one in the Disney Minifigures; however, this does not decrease the quality of the minifigure. The minifigure contains all of the necessary details including yellow bands on his shirt sleeves, dual moulded legs in white and bright light orange, a special duck-tail element,&nbsp;and a great head sculpt with separate hat. His head sculpt is detailed enough to even include a pink tongue inside his mouth!</p>

<p>Daisy Duck is another very detailed minifigure with medium purple bow, pink shirt with medium purple frills, and dual moulded legs in white&nbsp;and bright light orange similar to Donald Duck, only Daisy has medium purple shoes printed onto the minifigure&#39;s feet. From my bit of research, the medium purple shoes should probably have been printed in pink instead as most versions&nbsp;of Daisy Duck in the park&nbsp;seem to have pink shoes. Aside from the shoes, Daisy Duck is about as accurate as one could get given minifigure proportions.</p>

<p>Tinker Bell&nbsp;is the final minifigure in the set. Her inclusion most likely references her part in opening the fireworks show at Disney World&nbsp;by flying across the castle. As a minifigure Tinker Bell&nbsp;accurately represents the character&#39;s look with blond hair tied up in a bun, light blue fairy wings, and a lime green dress. Her legs have lime green shoes printed on the front of the toes only to make the shoes seem closer to the light slippers that Tinker Bell wears than the heavy shoes that Minnie Mouse and Daisy Duck wear. A wand is included for her as she holds one in the fireworks show at Disney World.</p>

<p>Some might complain that five minifigures in a $350 set seem a bit low, but given the scaling of the castle and the excellent quality of the included five minifigures, five seems just about right. One benefit of less minifigures is that&nbsp;more of the set&#39;s budget could be put into making the castle larger and more grand, which was certainly appreciated me. The exclusion of Cinderella from the minifigure line is certainly interesting considering that this is a recreation of her castle; however, her minidoll has already appeared several times in Disney Princess sets, so I expect that it was intended that you could get her from any of those sets instead. Plus, seeing as this set is based on the park, the included minifigures make complete sense as they are the&nbsp;most notable costumed characters from the Disney World.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The Disney Castle is an enjoyable build the entire way through despite some repetition. It took me a little over 10 hours at a leisurely pace&nbsp;to complete the set, but I imagine if less time was used adjusting&nbsp;parts to make sure the LEGO logos were all facing the same way it could be completed in about 7-8 hours. Marco Bessa put a lot of work into making sure that the castle had details from every angle.</p>

<p>Several interesting techniques are used in the creation of the angled subset tiled floor of the ballroom, the white decorative elements below the windows of each of the turrets, the windows on each of the three round turrets, and the railings of the main tower. Some details that are built into the castle are really only seen while building the castle like the four arches around the inside of the ballroom which each have a smaller light bluish grey arch and two taller tan half-arches that create a beautiful decorative arch.</p>

<p>As expected with a large castle, the set does have some repetitive steps; however, these builds are kept small and so infrequently that the build never becomes tedious.The build is divided into 14 sections/bags and three main sections of the castle (the base with the walls and gatehouse, the main tan building, and the final three floors of the tall spire. Each bag contains little details that make it so that no bag has a boring build.</p>

<p>Bag 1 builds the base of the castle and includes the small scene devoted to the Princess and the Frog. The next bag contains Mickey Mouse, the first minifigure, and builds the six elaborate pillars of the ballroom. Bag 3 starts build of the gatehouse and Bag 4 contains the elements needed to finish off the interior of the ballroom. This bag also includes the archery range from Brave and a grandfather clock that ties into Cinderella.The two knight statues (which are full minifigures)&nbsp;are included in Bag 4 as well. Bag 5 contains Minnie Mouse and builds the left wall of the castle, with Bag 6 building the right wall of the castle. Bag 6 also builds the Flying Carpet and Lamp from Aladdin. The next bag finally finishes off the gatehouse. Bag 8 introduces Donald Duck and starts the work on the upper portions of the left turret with Bag 9 finishing off the turrets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bag 10 begins work on the main tan tower and contains Daisy Duck. This bag also includes references to Beauty and the Beast&nbsp;(Lumiere&nbsp;and the rose in the glass jar) as well as the Little Mermaid (the kitchen) and Cinderella (the pumpkin). The next bag continues to build up the tower including references to Fantasia (mops, buckets, and wizard hat) and Sleeping Beauty (spinning wheel).Bag 12 finishes up the main tan tower with the Walt Disney Dream Suite and the base of the tall spire. This bag also includes a glass slipper for Cinderella and the Once Upon a Time printed&nbsp;book.</p>

<p>Bag 13 contains Tinker Bell, the final minifigure, and builds most of the tall turret excluding the gold spire. This bag references Tangled with&nbsp;a treasure chest filled with&nbsp;a hair brush, scissors, and a black lock of hair as well as Snow White with the Magic Mirror and the Poisoned Apple. Bag 14 completes the tower as well as the castle&nbsp;by adding the gold spire.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As I build the model, I realized that the Disney Castle would be very tall, even with that knowledge, I was still surprised by just how tall the completed model was. The castle easily dwarfs all my other tall sets by a large margin. The clever choice of tan for walls and white for detains on the main part of the castle allow the extravagant detailing to easily be seen and keeps it from being drowned out in a sea of white. The dark blue roofs complement nicely with the white, tan and light bluish grey and give the castle a royal feeling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unlike many models, this set looks great from almost every angle and could even be displayed with just the interior facing forward (although the exterior is still more impressive). Details are everywhere on the castle, including the sides, which makes the model feel more like a complete castle even though it is really only&nbsp;the front half of the real-life castle.&nbsp;Some especially impressive details include the white 1 x 2 plates and 1 x 1 tiles that form the supports for all of the battlements and walkways along with the strategic use of brick textured&nbsp;bricks only on the tops to accentuate the upper parts of each wall. The use of the six&nbsp;Light Bluish Gray&nbsp;Wedge 16 x 4 Triple Curved pieces around the three turrets combine with the rounded panels to create a gentle tapering shape which suits the fairytale feel of the castle.</p>

<p>This castle walks a fine line between minifigure scale details and a scaled model. Parts of the castle such as the steps to the entrance and the interiors are scaled to minifigures while the upper portions of the exterior are obviously not minifigure scale. Yet, even with two distinct scales converging in the same model, the finished castle does not feel like it compromised the look of the&nbsp;interior or the exterior to stay within scales. The tiny&nbsp;windows of the turrets and covered walkways look excellent and are far enough removed from any minifigure elements that the scale difference is not as obvious.</p>

<p>The large pieces used in creation of the main tower and in the lower walls of the castle do not reduce the detail of the castle, but instead provide some necessary contrast to the ornate details of the rest of the castle. Without those sections, the human eye would be unable to focus on any part of the set for very long.&nbsp;The brickwork stickers help to add detail on some of the larger panels, but even without them, the castle would still look just as impressive. It is also worth noting that the stickers in this set are very easy to apply. The stickers either filled entire surfaces (ex.&nbsp;the shields)&nbsp;or were forgiving on placement (ex. the&nbsp;brickwork).</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As is probably obvious from my glowing review of this set, I hugely recommend this set Disney and castle fans alike. With Nexo Knights replacing traditional castle sets for the time being, this set should help tide castle fans over to the next grand castle set. In fact, I am dubious if a more ornate castle set could&nbsp;be produced for the next long while.</p>

<p>It is easily worth the $350 entry tag, as this castle is quite large and easily surpasses the usual size cutoff for in this price range. I would even argue that this set could still be a great seller at the higher price of $400 (but there might be more people complaining about how few minifigures are in this set).</p>

<p>With an excellent range of new, rare, and useful parts, five superbly detailed minifigures, a build that is never boring, and an awe-inspiring final model, The Disney Castle is one set I would not pass up.</p>

"M_Boss","2016-12-03T23:58:42.92Z","One of my favorite sets","<p>Being a Lego fan and Disney fan, I knew had to buy it when I&nbsp;first saw it. So on the Saturday before Black Friday with double VIP points and the snow globe it bought it. Upon receiving the package and opening the box, I noticed that a bag a had opened during shipping, but luckily no pieces were missing.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The build began with a technic frame and 16x16&nbsp;plates. The build&nbsp;continues&nbsp;by building up the front door and surrounding parts. Then the side walls are attached after being assembled in a sub-build.&nbsp;The interior details are finished&nbsp;and then the spires are built on the lower section of the build. The spire builds are very repetitive and to my only complaint with the build.&nbsp;This lower, gray part of the castle is now finished and is set aside for the rest of the build. Next the tan part in back is built and will eventually be attached with 2x2 jumper plates similar to the modular buildings. &nbsp;The build continues by first building up the structure and then adding the interior&nbsp;details. Many of the classic Disney movies are referenced in the interior rooms. Finally, the tallest spire is built&nbsp;and attached also by 2x2 jumper plates. The finished castle is a wonderful sight and the build took me about 8 hours over 3 days.</p>

<p><strong>The Good</strong></p>

<p>One of my favorite things about the castle is its similarity to the real thing. The exterior is very realistic. Another part that I enjoy is the interior references to the Disney movies. All of the interiors represent thier movies very well.&nbsp;The minifigures are also great renditions of the characters they represent in real life and it is exciting that they are exclusive to this set.&nbsp;I don&#39;t know what else to highlight here as most of the castle is amazing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Bad</strong></p>

<p>I feel the worst thing about this castle is the amount of stickers used. I understand the use of the stone stickers along the exterior and the mirror sticker, but I feel all of the shields and&nbsp;2x2 tile, should have been printed. Another thing that is disappointing to me is the lack of minifigures. The ones that were included were great, but a few more would have been nice and I would have happily paid and extra $50 to get Cinderella, Merida (from <em>Brave</em>), Sleeping Beauty, and others from the movies referenced. The last complaint I have is the repetitiveness of the build, but there is not much you can do about it.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I feel this set is a great representation of the Disney&nbsp;Castle, and for the money is a great value.</p>

"RogueSquad","2016-08-28T20:28:51.703Z","The best set I've ever built","<p>This set is full of surprise and was probably the best build I&#39;ve done. There was always something to look forward to building whether it be a little detail hinting to a Disney movie to just getting to milestones in the build such as that next tower or that next wall. &nbsp;I have worked with a great Youtuber&nbsp;while building this and you can find a time lapse of my build here with a review to come later this week on this same channel.&nbsp;https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uEStW4CmwLA</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is quite interesting for this set as bags 1 3 5 9 12 and 13 are found inside a smaller box within the sets main box. The smaller box inside here is about half the size of the main box. &nbsp;The instructions are definitely much different from those of other expert sets such as the modular buildings. The set has one extremely large instruction booklet with approximately 850 steps in it. The book itself if very sturdy and you don&#39;t have to worry about destroying the instruction booklet as you build.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a lot of great new parts made just for this set that I am very happy with. If I had to guess I would say about 30 new pieces whether they are brand new or existing pieces in a new color. The only complaint I have about the parts is I wish there were a few more printed parts so I did not have to mess with stickers too much but with how many new pieces there were can&#39;t complain about 20 stickers.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Minifigures are great for this set representing the theme parks castle but wish there were a few different ones. I wish we did have a Cinderella to go with her castle and also wish there was a variation between Donald from the minifigures series and the one found in this set. Other than that good to have 4 brand new Disney figures commonly found in the theme parks that go with the set nicely and also I&#39;ve heard some criticism about Tinker Bell and trust me, she looks better in person.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build does not take that long and for anyone that has built any other expert set should take no more than 7-8 hours. &nbsp;It took me about 6 and a half hours to complete and it was probably my favorite build. The build is so much fun because of all the detail that exists within the set. It is so awesome to be building and you go to add something that doesn&#39;t really seem to fit then you are like oh I know what movie that&#39;s from. Also finding all the different pieces that are new is nice and just keeps you waiting to see what&#39;s in the next bag.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is huge and I had trouble finding somewhere to display it. It was so difficult to display because I had to chose between showing the front or back of the castle. While the front of the castle is the reason the people buy this set the back of the castle has so much detail and relates to so many Disney movies I was torn between the two. In the end my Lego side trumped my Disney side and I decided to display the front of the castle with the Disney minifigure series. &nbsp;There are 10 different movies represented within the build and all are shown so well. &nbsp;One thing I&#39;m not a huge fan of with the model is the &quot;fireworks&quot; launcher but overall helps the playability factor of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall defiantly one of my favorite sets to build and one of the best looking sets I own. I can only hope they will include more sets based on the Disney parks in the future as I am sure this set will do very well and do well for a long time to come.

",TRUE,5,5,5,4,4
"lentil","2017-02-07T14:53:27.107Z","Stupendous!","<p>I should start by admitting that I love 1) castles, 2) Disney World, and 3) Lego, so a Lego Disney Castle set pushes multiple big buttons for me just by existing! I did have very high expectations for this set though (especially given the pricetag), and can honestly say that they were EXCEEDED. Truly remarkable!</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The bags are separated into 14 numbered sets, containing from 1-3 bags each. This makes for a very streamlined and efficient build. I did some minimal sorting at the beginning of each step, but really only because I like to.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the minifigs do not come first all at once as they do in most sets (in my experience at least). Instead, they are distributed one at a time throughout the build, beginning with Mickey in bag 2. I personally prefer this, since I always want to start putting some walls up right away. Obviously you can go in and fish out the minifig parts (or set them aside for later if you prefer), so this probably doesn&rsquo;t matter that much either way&hellip;, but I thought the change was potentially notable.</p>

<p>The base of the castle is built first, and it is exceptionally stable and sturdy! It consists of a matrix of technic squares and pins, sandwiched between two layers of plates. Sloping pieces at the edges attractively hide the inner contents of this strong 1-brick high base from view. The strength of the base is fantastic &ndash; you can in fact support the entire castle by the front steps alone with one hand (if your grip is strong enough) without it cracking! Compared to, for example, #4842 Hogwarts Castle (2010 version), whose fragile construction has made me curse in surprising ways so many times, the excellent engineering of this castle is much appreciated. The walls and towers of the castle itself are also very sturdy and well bonded together. There are many small decorative details that will be prone to getting accidentally knocked off or askew during play, but this hefty fellow is certainly not going to fall to pieces every time somebody sneezes like #4842.</p>

<p>The build is of course long, but not tedious at all. There is some symmetry to the castle, but lots of asymmetrical elements as well to keep things interesting. Some of the other large sets that I have built (e.g. #10214 Tower Bridge, and #10247 Ferris Wheel) have been so repetitious in parts that it actually felt like a bit of a slog &ndash; there were definitely times that I was just pushing through to get done, and not really enjoying the process (despite the fact that I generally love building with legos). Not so with the Disney Castle &ndash; the build was fantastically varied and a sheer delight to build! The only mildly tedious element I&rsquo;d say was building the little white crenelated decorations (there are several dozen of these), but they are interspersed throughout the build so it&rsquo;s not too bad. In general each step drew me onwards with fun new elements, and I found it hard to stop once I got going.</p>

<p>A variety of interesting building techniques are used throughout the castle: lots of SNOT, as well as offsetting and floating bricks on tiles to create interesting angles. The decorative elements, especially around the front entrance and on the towers, show some brilliantly creative use of pieces for lovely visual effects. Overall this castle is by far the most impressive Lego set I have personally built in terms of solid engineering and creative building design. The designer did an amazing job on many levels here! Often there seems to be a bit of tension between aesthetic considerations and structural ones, but here these principles have been executed harmoniously and at high levels!</p>

<h3>The Interior</h3>

<p>One of the things that I think was a brilliant design decision for this set is that although the exterior is modeled on a real building (the Cinderella Castle at the Magic Kingdom), the interior is a complete fantasy. And this fantasy surely resonates with many children (past and present) who have ever visited Walt Disney World &ndash; isn&rsquo;t it the wish of every child, on first entering the park, to go inside the castle and explore? We imagine it to be a maze of staircases and rooms, inhabited by numerous Disney princesses, heroes, and fantastic creatures. We long to run from room to room and discover its magical secrets. How disappointing when we learn (if we are allowed inside at all) that it contains nothing but a hair salon and an overpriced restaurant serving warmed up casserole! Fortunately, the Lego Disney Castle contains everything we wish the real one did &ndash; room after room filled with treasures from favorite Disney movies. I like that they chose to represent a variety of movies from different time periods &ndash; including older films like Fantasia and Snow White, as well as more recent ones like Brave and Tangled, and some in between.</p>

<p>In general I thought all the little interior decorations were fabulously done, with two small personal quibbles being 1) the bed and curtains in the bedroom completely obscure the window, which seems weird, and 2) Merida&rsquo;s archery range area is sandwiched on a narrow landing between two layers of towers and is extremely difficult to access for play (my daughter commented on this right away).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The only major-ish criticism I have, which has been mentioned by pretty much every reviewer, is the quantity and choice of minifigures. First of all, most sets in this size/price range include 2-3 times the number of minifigures (for comparison, #10247 Ferris Wheel has 10, #70751 Temple of Airjitzu has 13, #10217 Diagon Alley has 12, #75059 Sandcrawler has 14). The Disney Castle has a piddly 5. Maybe they were marketing it solely to adults (a mistake, I&rsquo;d say) and figured (wrongly, I&rsquo;d say) that adults aren&rsquo;t interested in minifigs? 10-15 would have been a more appropriate number for a set of this size/nature.</p>

<p>Secondly, the particular selection of minfigs included is a bit disappointing. Mickey and Minnie are musts, of course, and Tinkerbelle is a nice touch, but the lack of a Cinderella fig (since it *is* Cinderella&rsquo;s Castle, after all) and her prince, or really any princesses and princes, seems really odd and limits playability. Especially if you&rsquo;re only going to have 5 figs, Donald and Daisy could have been swapped out for something more interesting. At least one exclusive prince/princess duo should have been included, and a villain or two would have been awesome! Some pets/animals would also seem appropriate (Cinderella&rsquo;s mice/birds/dogs come to mind). All the little rooms alluding to various Disney movies are so cute - an assortment of figures to go with some (or all) of these really would have made sense.</p>

<p>That being said, it&rsquo;s not terribly difficult to supplement the minifigs by purchasing more on the side (obviously at additional cost to yourself&hellip;). We supplemented with #10729 Cinderella&rsquo;s Carriage, which includes Cinderella, Prince Charming, and a small but cute little carriage. My daughter also happened to already have #41052 Ariel&rsquo;s Magic Kiss (Ariel &amp; Prince Eric), and #30116 Rapunzel&rsquo;s Market Visit (a polybag with Rapunzel). We had also picked up a few of the Disney Collection figures and happened to get the Genie, Maleficent, and Ursula &ndash; all relevant additions to the playset. There are several other small Disney sets featuring various characters that are available as well. (Hm, maybe &ldquo;encouraging&rdquo; you to buy more like this was the secret agenda here&hellip;?) Some of these will obviously be miniDOLLS rather than figs, but if you and/or your child are not too puritanical about this sort of thing (we are not), then you have plenty of options.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>In addition to being a show-stopping display piece (from both front and back, by the way), this castle would be the dollhouse of many children&rsquo;s dreams. My 10 (going on 11) year old daughter has been chomping at the bit for me to get it finished, and started playing with it even as it was a half-built work in progress. Again I do think adding at least a handful of minifigs/dolls from your own child&rsquo;s favorite Disney characters is almost essential for full playability though.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>I was able to purchase the castle with double VIP points, and also got a nice promotional item that I really wanted, which took the sting out *somewhat*, but obviously it&rsquo;s still a very pricey set. I have not seen it sold discounted as yet (do sets of this type ever go on sale&hellip;?). However, I&rsquo;d say even at full price it represents a fair value (relative to other LEGO sets): 1) the price per piece is actually quite decent, especially considering that it&rsquo;s a licensed set, 2) the pieces included are not just little piddly 1x1s &ndash; there are a large number of hefty, interesting pieces that would be useful for any number of builds, and 3) it represents outstanding creativity, beauty, and playability value. Compare for example #10214 Tower Bridge, which has slightly more pieces but a significantly lower price: the Bridge is mostly 1x plates and other tiny pieces, mostly in tan, includes 0 minifigs, and has little to no playability. The Disney Castle involves a whole heck-load of ABS, quite a bit of it in gorgey Earth Blue and various interesting slopes, etc. If an item in this price/size class is in the budget for you, I&rsquo;d say this one is actually the most attractive value proposition of its class available currently, obviously if the theme has appeal for you.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Stunning beauty and impressive size. Brilliant, strong, creative design. Fabulous interior and exterior details. Fun, imaginative play opportunities. Certainly the most incredible Lego set I have personally encountered. I really hope TLG produces more sets at this level!</p>

"rhyde","2017-03-09T21:18:25.32Z","Awesome! Awesome! Awesome!","<p>This is hands-down the favorite set that I own. At over 2 1/2 feet tall, there&#39;s room for all kinds of hidden treasures. I&#39;ve had people look at it multiple times and they&#39;re always finding something new.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its a bit of a stretch however to state that you get 7 minifigs, when 2 of them are knights that are part of the building and not a character.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other than that, this is an incredible set - expect to spend somewhere in the neighborhood of 14-20 hours assembling it and a lifetime enjoying it.</p>

"LSWFan","2017-09-15T13:29:46.08Z","A simply stunning rendition of a Disney landmark","<p>Having been fortunate enough to have visited Disney World a few times, I ordered this set as soon as I heard about it, and am very glad I did. &nbsp;The model is based squarely on Cinderella&#39;s castle from the heart of the Magic Kingdom theme park and LEGO have done an incredible job of coming up with something reasonably accurate, bearing in mind the scale used.</p>

<p>The box even has photographs depicting the completed model outside the real castle, so you can compare the two. &nbsp;Although some of the colouring isn&#39;t quite right, considering the limitations the designers had to work with, they have done a remarkable job.</p>

<p>Taking into account the piece count and the price, the Disney Castle comes in a large and attractive blue box. &nbsp;Inside, there are a number of bags, some of which are housed in a secondary white box, plus the instruction manual. &nbsp;A bit of sorting is required here, as the bags are numbered and that&#39;s it, so getting them in order is useful. &nbsp;I was disappointed that the packaging was so basic. &nbsp;My previous experience of a large LEGO build, the original <em>Star Wars</em> Death Star, consisted of numbered internal boxes and a ring-bound manual. &nbsp;That isn&#39;t featured here and as a result the box bulges a little with so many bags jostling for space. &nbsp;Overall you could see some cost-cutting in the packaging which was a shame at a premium price point.</p>

<p>Anyway, the build itself is magnificent and every bit as good as the finished model. &nbsp;I spread the build over a number of days and you are talking about several hours in total, but that is part of the attraction in a set like this, for me at least. &nbsp;The base is a whole lot of grey but thankfully broken up by a stunning mosaic floor in the middle. &nbsp;Once the base is complete, it&#39;s all about walls and the fantastic themed rooms inside the castle.</p>

<p>Although LEGO have obviously stuck with the strict castle design on the outside, imagination has run riot inside. &nbsp;A number of Disney movies are referenced:&nbsp;a bow and arrow plus target from <em>Brave</em>, the magic carpet from <em>Aladdin</em>, Cinderella&#39;s glass slipper, Snow White&#39;s mirror, hair brushes and so on from <em>Tangled</em>, Mickey&#39;s magician&#39;s hat and a mop from <em>Fantasia</em>&nbsp;plus much more. &nbsp;There are even frogs outside the castle, presumably representing <em>The Princess and the Frog</em>. &nbsp;It&#39;s fantastic, a lot of fun to build and then play around with when completed.</p>

<p>The castle&nbsp;is modular in as much as the upper floors can be detached as their own unit very easily in order to better access different aspects of the model. &nbsp;There are a few good play features, and in the latter stages you find yourself suddenly putting together what seems to be a set of guns, only to&nbsp;find they are &#39;firework&#39; launchers to go in the main tower. &nbsp;A nice touch to represent the real castle. &nbsp;Overall though, the castle has the feel of a display piece more than an out-and-out toy and in my house, it sits in our dining room as exactly that. &nbsp;Which isn&#39;t to say it doesn&#39;t get rotated around to show the inside and move the minifigs&nbsp;about, of course.</p>

<p>As with all that can be good, there is a but. &nbsp;And that is the aforementioned minifigures. &nbsp;There are just five, and that is staggeringly low for a set of this size. &nbsp;To reference so many Disney films and not include related minifigs&nbsp;is really surprising. &nbsp;You get Mickey and Minnie, which is fine, and Donald and Daisy, which seems a little odd but they&#39;re okay. &nbsp;Lastly, there is Tinkerbell, which is a great inclusion and a really nice figure. &nbsp;But a further five (Cinderella, Snow White, the Genie, Merida and so on) would have surely made a lot of sense.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a deal breaker as the main attraction is the castle itself and it&#39;s magnificent. &nbsp;Standing at around 30&quot; tall it will catch anybody&#39;s eye. &nbsp;It&#39;s just a shame that with so much to see on the inside, there aren&#39;t more minifigs to adorn it. &nbsp;But don&#39;t let that put you off. &nbsp;If you love Disney and LEGO this set is the very definition of a no-brainer. &nbsp;If you can, treat yourself. &nbsp;You won&#39;t regret it.</p>
