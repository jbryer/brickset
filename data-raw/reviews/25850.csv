"Witolman","2016-01-23T14:31:05.1Z","Awesome magazine gift","<p>I live in Poland so I could get this set with Donald Duck magazine which costs 2,50$!!! (10zl)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Surprisingly interesting. I like building polybag sets without instructions, because it&#39;s way more fun that way and I think you should try it too.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s bigger than I thought (9,5cm high) and has many details for a polybag set. It uses <span class=""short_text"" id=""result_box"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">binoculars as cannons and even has a ramp which is very impressive when you look at the scale. Sadly it&#39;s again grey instead of black and the wings can&#39;t make that V shape, but it&#39;s just a 43-piece set, so I&#39;ll let it pass.</span></span></p>

<p><span class=""short_text"" lang=""en""><span class=""hps"">I think it&#39;s a very good mini model. I&#39;ll recommend this over the big one.</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong>Nothing unique in the set. The only piece that was nice to get is the light grey bioncular pieces that are used for side cannons on the wings.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong>The build was really easy not hard at all. The build took me under 5 minutes to build the shuttle.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Complete Model:</b>&nbsp;When the ship was finished I wished it was a little bigger although it is a polybag so I can let it slide. I wish that the made the wings go into the V shape like in the movie, and/or have the wings retrack down and up like in the movie. Other than that the set was perfect. They have a ramp under the front of the shuttle and the cannons on the side were also a nice touch as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b>Overall opinion minus my opinion on the wings it is a great polybag and really nice to display on a desk or to be played with as well. My overall opinion on this is a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

The ship is not in the correct color (Black) and cannot move its wings out like it does in the movie. There is some playability in that you can move it with your hands but the thing is, its not that kind of ship that fights in combat so it doesn&#39;t really move quickly in the movie an it actually moves rather slowly. I would recommend not buying this at all, unless you find them on sale for less than a dollar and want to part them out.</p>
