Showcasing the talents of everybody behind the LEGO Star Wars creative team, and even involving several clever jokes.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The case is decent enough with a very nice image of the LEGO Star Wars Droid Tales character roster in a standard Star Wars looking design. The menus are fine as well, and the animation is crisp and highly visually impressive. The detailing of the LEGO Characters are sharp and easy to identify who is who, and the voice work is very stellar with a great cast. Unlike The Yoda Chronicles release they included all of the episodes, so you aren&rsquo;t missing anything.</span></span></span></span></p>

What we get instead are three Topps trading cards. A card for Darth Vader, a card for Stormtroopers and a card for Rebels with brief write-ups on the back. Honestly this is a bit unfortunate, there is a brand new print option for Chewbacca at the end of this special that could have made for a great pack-in Minifigure, similar to the medal sporting Darth Vader in The Empire Strikes Out.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The fact that one was not included is a real head scratcher as pretty much all of the specials so far have had Minifigures included, even if they were weak releases like the Scooby-Doo special. However since this is a five episode mini arc similar to the Yoda Chronicles I suspect LEGO chose not to include a minifiure, which as I&rsquo;ve said before, is a real shame.</span></span></span></span></p>

The five individual episodes of Droid Tales are the only included visual elements. They make for a great almost two hour special to watch, however I feel it might have been nice to have a behind the scenes making of featurette or some other short featurette included, perhaps some sort of digital game similar to a look-and-find adventure hunting for R2 in various busy images.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The special alone is great and loaded with the comedic charm of LEGO Star Wars specials and shows of the past, but there isn&rsquo;t much else to do here after it&rsquo;s been viewed, except watch it again and again, which I&rsquo;m certain the younger viewers will enjoy doing.</span></span></span></span></p>

The LEGO Specials of this type have always been solid presentations and fun to watch. The only knock against it is that they seem to be shying away from producing these, or including Minifigures in each release to add greater value to the videos. I&rsquo;d still recommend this, it&rsquo;s a fun and funny romp through the galaxy far, far away re-telling events from the complete saga and an episode of the Rebels cartoon from the point of view of Star Wars&rsquo; own Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. (C-3PO &amp; R2-D2 respectively.) Recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-08-10T06:32:23.243Z","This is how you watch Star Wars with toddlers","<p>This is Star Wars episodes 1-6 but appropriate for toddlers. Basically it is a 5 show miniseries, the first show covers episodes 1 &amp; 2. The second covers episode 3 and I believe Star Wars Rebels (I&rsquo;m not sure however as I&rsquo;ve never seen that show). Then the next 3 episodes cover each movie in the original trilogy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Basically the shows begin at the very end of Return of the Jedi, C3PO is cleaning up after the celebration on Endor&nbsp;and starts telling the story&nbsp;of how it all began as R2-D2&nbsp;gets kidnapped. So C3PO&nbsp;goes to save him and continues telling his story to whoever is there to listen. Of course at the end of the last show there is a happy ending to this new story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Basically the prequel trilogy gets run through very quickly and is not very detailed. The original trilogy however gets covered in full detail, or at least as much detail as you can fit into 20 minutes per movie. The story of course is mainly told from C3PO&rsquo;s point of view, but still covers events that he would not have witnessed but our necessary for the story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While you might consider this a spoiler for your kids, my son has so many Star Wars books that we read every day that he already knows the whole story in much greater detail. As for adults and older kids, it is still fun to watch and has some pretty good jokes in it. However, I&rsquo;m not sure if you would ever choose to watch this over the actual movies. This is really just a great miniseries for kids too young to watch the movies. The only problem with it is that it is broken up into 5 separate shows so my son knows he is watching TV shows and not a movie, and at 2 hours in total length it is a little bit too long.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would highly recommend getting this film. It is Lego&#39;s best one yet!</p>
