"AddictedToStyrene","2016-10-24T00:47:13.787Z","Excellent book, great model - how will you build it?","<p>Updated&nbsp;review of this book, with my thoughts on the book, the build and suggested substitutes for some expensive parts. The book&nbsp;is still for sale (October 2019) at the Arvo Brothers&#39; website www.arvobrothers.com for 26 Euros (about US $30).</p>

<p>The book is excellent. It&#39;s a hardback, clearly printed and beautifully illustrated. More than the instructions for the Arvo Brothers&#39; version of the bike from Akira, it&#39;s a story of their decisions and challenges during the design and build. The book is written in good&nbsp;English although a&nbsp;couple of sentences aren&#39;t very clear (but 100% better than my Spanish.)</p>

<p>The story starts with the brothers&#39; thoughts on the bike itself, how the movie artists developed it, and how accurate (or not) the various toys and models of the bike are. The build follows, broken into three sections as they construct the front, body and rear in order. In each section they build the workings and chassis, before the outer shell goes on. The build (and parts list) make two versions of the front wheel and forks, so you can choose to build either or both.</p>

<p>The build has a lot of very interesting techniques. Stacking of plates and slopes. SNOT and inversions. Places where pieces are put together but don&#39;t connect, until the next stages surround them. Hinges and technic pieces that turn just enough to make the right shape. Possibly the most extreme technique is stretching large Lego tyres over medium size wheels to give a curved profile. Take your time with this, it&#39;s hard to do but very effective. My tip: soften the tyres in hot water first (kitchen tap, not boiling! I also&nbsp;used a paper towel to wick away the water so it wasn&#39;t trapped in the tyre).</p>

<p>The Arvo brothers admit that their bike build is not 100% accurate to the movie design&nbsp;(which is not consistent throughout the movie) or any single toy replica. The brothers explain their design choices pretty well. They are as interested in the &#39;workings&#39; of the bike as much as the outside shape, and that has translated into the Lego build. They also acknowledge that lots of the pieces are very hard to find and/or expensive.</p>

<p>However, if you are buying this book you are probably capable of making your own substitutions. Will you still build the bike in the&nbsp;&#39;original&#39;&nbsp;red? Will you add different details? What will you add, change or leave off? Will you buy entire MISB sets just to get those parts?</p>

<p>The book also comes with a sheet of two sets of die cut stickers, accurate to the movie bike. You could ignore those, or make up your own. Purists who are building with alternate Lego bricks/colours might want to look at various Lego stickers to decorate their own interpretation. I found most of the stickers went on without any issues (although some cover multiple parts). However, the &#39;Canon&#39; sticker seems to be too large. I recommend trimming the red border off.</p>

<p>As a book and a design story, Kaneda&#39;s Bike is very good quality and a great read. Even if you never build the bike, this book is a great addition to a Lego library. As a set of instructions for a model there are some personal choices by the Arvo brothers which experienced Lego fans might question - but the brothers explain themselves well. It&#39;s up to the reader to take on the challenge of finding the parts and building their own.</p>

<p>The two versions of the front portion of the bike are a movie version and a &#39;naked&#39; version, because the Arvo Brothers like the structures and machinery there. So, when you are collecting parts for the bike you only need&nbsp;four X-Pod upper dishes, not six. Check the instructions as well as the parts list, before you head to your favourite resales site.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My suggestions for part substitutions, particularly&nbsp;when the original parts are stupidly expensive:</p>

<p>- for&nbsp;the red 5 wide Scala dishes, use dark bluish grey with a matching &#39;boat stud&#39; inside. (I am not kidding about this. Price check as of September 2018: dark bluish grey&nbsp;on Bricklink&nbsp;is between US 23c and $1.11 while&nbsp;red is between US $28.00 to $111.00. Around 100 times the price!)</p>

<p>- ten of the 1 x 1 brick with one stud&nbsp;on the side and four 2 x 2 round plates are invisible when the bike is complete, so they can be any colour. These aren&#39;t&nbsp;rare pieces, but when you are building this set, you will want to save&nbsp;some money for other parts.</p>

<p>- for the red 2 x 2 x 2 turntable bricks, use black, or build a similar piece from bricks, plates, brackets and/or technic pieces. On some toy versions of the bike, these details are a dull silver colour, so any grey&nbsp;or silver shade will do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- for the black 1 x 3 x 6 curved windscreens, use red, light bluish grey&nbsp;or trans-black. These parts are mostly hidden by the seat and rear wheel structure. Alternatively, find the&nbsp;Ninjago set 70504 Garmatron, which has two. It&#39;s not too expensive for a second hand set and will be a good source of parts for other projects.</p>

<p>- the dark bluish grey 10 x 10 dishes inside the front wheel&nbsp;are hidden by the X-Pod covers, so you can use any colour. Trans-clear and light bluish gray are inexpensive. Remember you only need four&nbsp;if you are only building one version of the front wheel.</p>

<p>- the rear tyre&nbsp;(part 32296) was only available in one&nbsp;Technic Ferrari&nbsp;set (8674) and is very expensive. Consider using one of the variants with printing on the sidewalls, perhaps buying it as an assembly with the wheel as this can sometimes be cheaper than just the tyre. Either 32296pb01&nbsp;from set 8458 or 32296pb02&nbsp;from set 8461&nbsp;should be a fraction of the cost of the blank version. The sidewall writing will be hidden from view by the wheel covers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- the X-Pod caps are critical to the build and red ones have been very expensive since this book was published. If you find the original X-Pod set (4349 Wild Pod) at a bargain price for a &#39;complete set&#39;, make sure the seller is including the pod pieces, not just the polybag from the inside!&nbsp;The pod pieces are available in several other colours, if you want to build the bike in a colour&nbsp;other than red. But, remember that some of the pieces in the body will not be available in the same range of colours as the pod lids. One solution is to build the bike in two major colours. For&nbsp;instance: main body in white, with some details and the wheel covers&nbsp;in lime green or orange</p>

<p>- the 2 x 2 trans clear plate and tile that make up the headlight can each be replaced by pairs of 1 x 2 pieces. These parts are well hidden by the windscreens of the movie version of the bike and the difference will not be obvious.</p>

<p>- if you are building in a colour other than red, consider that the 1 x 6 x 3 windscreen (part 64453) on the rear wheel mount&nbsp;is only available in limited colours (not white, for instance). I brick built a similar arrangement from plates and brackets. A bit more complicated but it&nbsp;looks OK.</p>

<p>Finally, the bike is mostly solid once built. The wheels do not turn so it&#39;s definitely a display model, not a toy.&nbsp;However, the middle section is weaker than the rest. If you are moving the bike, you should remove the front section and hold the main body&nbsp;carefully around the middle to ensure the side fairings don&#39;t come off or the&nbsp;bike doesn&#39;t break apart there. If you are storing or moving the built bike I recommend separating the front section from the main body.&nbsp;</p>
