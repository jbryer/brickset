<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Bridge Model is designed quite nicely with a good use of clips and bars to connect everything together, small size of model also captures a cute look very nicely.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Includes printed map tile piece and a small frog pond additional build that looks very fun.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Olivia Mini-Doll included features cargo pants in dark blue and sleeveless dark rose top. Also has camera and satchel accessory pieces.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Difficult to find if you missed it during the giveaway.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Scale of bridge can only accommodate the one Mini-Doll at a given time.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Model easily falls apart from the base, single large plate should have been used to strengthen the base of the model.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This is a great Friends Polybag, the model is super fun and offers up some great play opportunities, especially when added to the larger Adventure Camp sets. It&rsquo;s also got a great parts-per-price ratio considering it was free at the time. Recommended.</p>

<p>The frog on a rock is a nice change of pace from those on lilypads. Either way, it&#39;s appropriate for the water setting; Friends sets often have animals that don&#39;t fit the set&#39;s topic, like the hedgehog in 41120 Adventure Camp Archery. I also liked the new backpack piece.</p>

<p>It would be easy to combine multiple copies if you got them cheap, which I didn&#39;t. I missed it as a promo, and later saw some at the LEGO Store for $5. Usually polybags start out around $4 and can be found discounted. I was still glad to get a few towards the then-current promo and to complete my collection of the theme.</p>
