<p><br />
391508 Bulkar was one of the foil packs I picked up from a LEGO Chima magazine.<br />
<br />
I recently dug up my very small but substantial Chima collection to relive some of my childhood memories (which is an important part of my life now that I am in my teenage years).<br />
<br />
I found this entire set unopened in one of my shelves, so of course I had to review it on Brickset - I just love reviewing lesser-known sets for people who just might be interested.<br />
<br />
<strong>Packaging</strong><br />
<br />
The packaging is just a small rectangular foil bag, which is common packaging for magazine gifts that come with the&nbsp;Immediate Media LEGO magazine publishings.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
One small issue with this specific kind of packaging, is that the opening flap is always glued too tight to the pack, which is a bit of an issue for people who don&#39;t want to rip or crinkle the foil. If I&#39;m patient, I take my time (about a minute or two) and carefully peel the flap, but sometimes I just whip out the scissors.<br />
<br />
The art on the foil pack is pretty attractive, with&nbsp;age specifications, name of character included, and a &quot;Limited Edition&quot; label. (technically, the figure <strong>is</strong> limited edition, but only because all of the parts included have never been in this same configuration).&nbsp;Of course, there is also a beautiful Chima logo with an icy design on a fiery background, which contrasts really well.<br />
<br />
<br />
There&#39;s also a nice CGI rendering of Bladvic (not Bulkar, but is a member of the Bear tribe and is close enough) and an image of the LEGO Bulkar minifigure.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<em><strong>There is also a packaging&nbsp;art error here!!!</strong></em> On the foil pack, Bulkar is displayed with the normal pearl gold Chima armour, and I was pleasantly surprised to find out that he indeed came with the more sought-after peal gold <em>heavy</em> armour. This is a minor detail, albeit important.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contents and Build</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Bulkar</strong>&nbsp;is made up of six pieces: the aforementioned pearl gold&nbsp;heavy armour, a Fire Chi 1x1 trans-orange printed&nbsp;round tile,&nbsp;torso, legs, head and extended bear head piece.<br />
<br />
His weapon has three pieces: a gold blade piece from LEGO Ninjago, a pearl gold <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4640843/%C3%B83-2-shaft-w-cored-knob"">shaft with cored knob</a>, and a relatively&nbsp;rare flame blade piece that has not once been used outside of Chima. (which is a shame in my opinion, considering that this piece could be very useful)<br />
<br />
Foil packs like these are usually gifts that come with LEGO magazines published by Immediate Media, and these packs usually don&#39;t come with instructions - the instructions would be included on pages of the magazine. Since this set is essentially just a minifigure, this is not much of an issue - it is very easy to build, even for the most inexperienced of beginners. (however this may be a bit of an issue for other similar foil packs like Star Wars ships and locations microbuilds)<br />
<br />
It took me half a minute to put everything together, which is to be expected, but there really wasn&#39;t much of a process.<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigure</strong><br />
<br />
The Bulkar minifigure is quite rare, only appearing once in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70223-1/Icebite-s-Claw-Driller"">70223 Icebite&#39;s Claw Driller</a>, so I was very happy to acquire him in such a cheap set. Even now, this foil pack still goes for a reasonably affordable price on the aftermarket.<br />
<br />
The figure has more than reasonable accessories - as I mentioned, the fire blade piece is now very rare so I am very happy to have got my first one in this set.<br />
<br />
The printing on this figure is excellent too. It captures the most distinctive features of the Bear tribe. There is a wide streak of medium nougat fur across the torso where a bear&#39;s belly would be. A&nbsp;metallic gold chestplate design with Fire Chi plugged in adorns the front of the torso, which continues onto the back with a nice gold spine guard with brown straps.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A nice dark brown pouch hangs&nbsp;from the chest plate on the right side of the figure with a small bee print, which I think represents honey that Bulkar carries with him. The hands are actually dark brown, which is different to the reddish brown of the torso.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The legs have similarly detailed printing - metallic grey armour plates below dark bluish grey hips with intricate gold hexagonal patterns running across, not to mention realistic battle wear.&nbsp;There&#39;s also nice metallic gold knee pads with nice beehive symbols on them, and these have dark brown straps around them. There are also printed white&nbsp;claws on the feet.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Streaks of fur are also positioned&nbsp;across the entire figure, giving some realistic detail, even on the extended head piece, which also has a medium nougat snout tip which contrasts well with all the reddish brown.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Bulkar&#39;s head has two expressions, which are actually very similar and are only differentiated largely by the positioning of the eyebrows&nbsp;-&nbsp;one is a slightly happy face with a raised eyebrow, the other is a slight frown with level&nbsp;eyebrows. As good as these face prints are, I would have loved to see some more variation, for example a sleepy bear face.<br />
<br />
To top this figure off, you can add on his pearl gold heavy armour with the&nbsp;1x1 trans-orange printed&nbsp;round tile representing&nbsp;Fire Chi. You can also leave it off though, because the printing on the torso is more than good enough for display.<br />
<br />
<strong>Playability</strong><br />
<br />
The playability that this set offers is extremely limited, but children would have fun swinging Bulkar around hitting invisible enemies or ones from their own collection. I would say that this minifigure would best fit in Chima Fire vs. Ice&nbsp;LEGO dioramas and MOCs.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall thoughts</strong><br />
<br />
391508 is a great foil pack with a very rare (and technically exclusive) minifigure from the long-retired Chima theme, and I would definitely recommend it to any fan of Chima - Bulkar is a great Bear to have among your ranks of Chima warriors.</p>
