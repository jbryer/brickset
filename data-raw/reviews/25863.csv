<p>The snowspeeder is one&nbsp;of the original trilogys&nbsp;most iconic vehicles and Lego has produced many renditions of the craft .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build is simplistic but affective certain elements make this build look accurate the 1&times;4&nbsp;bars and binoculars make for very nice forward cannons and harpoon and tow cable .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a very nice little build perhaps my personal nostalgia has an influence on my opinion but I do think it is good . It is very much a shame that the magazine AT-AT looks so atrocious they could have looked great next to each other .</p>
