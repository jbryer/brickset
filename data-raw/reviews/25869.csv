<p>Police Chase is a promo I remember getting in 2016&nbsp;and back then I wasn&#39;t too fond of it and today my opinion is unchanged .</p>

<p>The builds and cardboard-</p>

<p>The builds are a police car and a getaway car and they are both just fine made out of basic uninteresting pieces and the only playability is driving them around . The horrible cheap cardboard ramp and score board are just a cost saving measure and is something that I never bothered to keep in 2016&nbsp;and I still don&#39;t regret that decision I prefer only having the cars&nbsp;.</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is one of my least favorite owned sets and I wish Lego&nbsp;would stop including cardboard that is intended to interact with the bricks its not part of the Lego system so stop using it .</p>
