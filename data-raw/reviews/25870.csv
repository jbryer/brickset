<p>Welcome&nbsp;to my review of the First Order General, a character who made a brief appearance in The Force Awakens.&nbsp;He/them was/were&nbsp;seen in the background during General Hux&acute;s speech, alongside with other prominent officers from the First Order. While the speech was a bit controversial due to&nbsp;similarities with Hitler during Nazi meetings in Nuremberg, I hope You still want to read this review (:</p>

<p><strong>The figure </strong></p>

<p>The printing over the torso is pretty simple with a belt and some wrinkles, and looks better than the printing on General Hux, as it isn&acute;t striking and gives the figure a more &quot;real&quot; look, especially when the wrinkles aren&acute;t too obvious.&nbsp;On the back the belt printing continues The legs are plain black, and I feel&nbsp;that there is&nbsp;room for a slight improvement here, as they look a bit odd compared to the details overall.</p>

<p>The headpiece/cap looks nice and it&nbsp;is has only appeared on one other character; General Hux. The arm printing is what makes this figure so special; it is small, yet detailed and probably indicates the rank of the general. This is a major change between his imperial counterparts, who wore the rank symbols (or what they are called) on the chest.</p>

<p>However, my favorite part of the figure is the face. It looks a bit confused, perhaps worried, and suits the character excellent, as you may expect working for Ren and Hux can be hard even with maximum effort. He has dark grey eyebrows, so he&acute;s been around for a while.</p>

<p>Printing and detailing score: <strong>4</strong> out of <strong>5 </strong>possible stars. It&acute;s a great fig, but for being a promo, I feel the lack of leg printing a bit disturbing, and the lack of an accessory doesn&acute;t really add to the play value.</p>

<p><strong>Show-accuracy</strong></p>

<p>The character appears only for a brief moment in one scene&nbsp;of the film, so it isn&acute;t instantly recognizable at first glance and the source material is pretty much nothing but one blurry picture on him. The face and the printing over his body is, from what I&acute;ve seen,&nbsp;very accurate. The only thing which bothers me is that the First Order insignia is printed using the same shade of grey/light as the torso printing, which actually isn&acute;t really accurate. It could have been done using a more flashy color, and the insignia itself isn&acute;t pentagonal in the movie, more rounded and circle-shaped.</p>

<p>Aside from that, there isn&acute;t&nbsp;anything else&nbsp;to complain about. It is a very show-accurate fig for being Lego, and gets a score of <strong>4.5 </strong>in terms of show-accuracy.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>I found this for&nbsp;1.90 bucks&nbsp;each in a local toy store and bought five of them, which I don&acute;t regret now. It&acute;s a great figure, and it costs only&nbsp;4.99 GBP + shipping on Amazon if you want to buy it. If you&acute;re building a First Order army, or just want to expand your minifigure collection, this is a good choice. However, I&acute;d love to see it coming with a blaster pistol and leg printing.</p>

<p>It gets an overall score of <strong>8.5</strong> out of <strong>10</strong>. Now I only have one minor problem: I haven&acute;t got&nbsp;a single First Order Storm trooper, so my generals have no army...</p>

&nbsp;</p>

<p>The First Order General has a lot of detail for only 4.00.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Box/Instruction Manual:</strong>&nbsp;The First Order General comes in a polybag and has no instructions. The bag only shows the general and thats&nbsp;it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong>&nbsp;There are 4 parts to the set with the pants, body, head, and hat. The only unique piece is the generals hat with a unique look to it and has some very good detail on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifig:&nbsp;</strong>The First Order General has a lot of detail on him which is very nice to get in a minifigure from a polybag. He has normal black pants but his body is very good with his rank printed on his right arm. The face looks older than what the bags shows which surprised me right away but was nice since most officers in the Empire and First Order are older or look older. The First Order General does not come with a weapon which is the only negative thing I have about this polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong>I don&#39;t really think I have to say anything since all you build is just a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:&nbsp;</strong>Not really much I can say here to execpt that I was surprised by how much older they made the general look and how much detail they put into him as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong>Overall this was great to be able to get for just 4 dollars. The amount of detail on him was very nice from the rank on his arm to the detail to his face and even the hat he wears was very nice with the detail and look it had. Overall I would give this a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A polybag without instructions, nothing specific to add.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Simple minifig without anything special, which explains the rating.</p>

<p><b>Minifig/Usefulness</b></p>

<p>The First Order General is a well-designed minifig, especially the hat, and the torso with a nicely printed detail on the left arm. However, the lack of detail to the legs is a minor con, according to me, and lowers the excitement of the exclusiveness of the figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The anonymity of the figure&#39;s identity increases its usefulness in different MOCs since the context in which he is presented is irrelevant, if you would want it to be displayed according to the film(s). A major pro of the set.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>Since its retail price was, as I understood it, free, getting the set&nbsp;when it was available in store was of course worth it. Even buying it on the after-market, which I did, is worth it if you appreciate the exclusiveness of these kinds of sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Overall a decent minifig polybag set, but nothing special. If you feel that there is one for a reasonably low price he is a nice addition to your collection.</p>
