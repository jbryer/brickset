"TK_1308","2016-08-04T18:09:21.17Z","""Oh man! I thought it was a water truck!""","<p>Lego releases it&#39;s fourth kit from Captain America: Civil War and continues with the &#39;airport battle theme&#39; with the Tanker Truck Takedown.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Mid range size rectangular box for a kit in this price range. The price per piece ratio is slightly higher than other kits in this class but seeing as there are two new minifigures in the kit, that&#39;s understandable.<br />
Spider-Man is the figure of choice on the top with a battle scene of all 4 figures next to him. The front of the box shows the four superheroes battling around the tanker and the back has more of the battle and 4 panels showing the play features and 2 devoted to the figures on each side.<br />
Oddly enough, this small kit has 2 small rectangular instruction manuals where 1 would&#39;ve been quite sufficient. Unlike other MCU sets, this one does not contain a comic.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A nice number of parts for a kit of this size with a good mix of colours present, more than you would expect from the set as it&#39;s displayed on the front. It also included some nice new pieces I haven&#39;t had in my collection before and I like the darker yellow colouring for the tanker.&nbsp;<br />
There are 3 bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains Captain America, Hawkeye, the windsock and stand, flame effects, motorbike and the Avengers health and safety favourite, the fire extinguisher.<br />
Bag 2 contains Spider-Man, some webbing, the cab and lower trailer of the tanker truck.<br />
Bag 3 contains Vision and the remaining parts for the tanker trailer.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with 4 minifigures.<br />
Firstly we have Captain America. This is the same as previous Civil War releases and he comes armed with his trusty shield.<br />
Next we have Vision. For those who missed out on this figure in the Quinjet City Chase of 2015, here&#39;s your chance to get this great character. It&#39;s the same figure as the previous release (with the mind stone now the right colour)&nbsp;and has the excellent torso and leg detailing and the nice golden yellow cloak.<br />
The other two figures are new additions to the MCU and very welcome to finish off the current set.<br />
Hawkeye hasn&#39;t been seen in a set since the Hydra Showdown set of 2015 so it&#39;s nice to see him again but in his new black and purple outfit. The detailing on his torso (front and back) and his legs is superb. A nice touch with the flesh arm / covered arm in the design. He has a double sided head with smiling / shouting faces. He comes armed with his black bow and maybe one day they will actually give him a quiver of arrows too.<br />
Lastly we have the new Spider-Man and this is probably one of my favourite figures released in the MCU to date. The detailing across the whole figure is excellent, especially the two tone paint job on the arms. He comes armed with a spray of webbing which he can hold in either hand.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 25 minutes.<br />
It&#39;s a very straightforward build with nothing very complicated in the construction.<br />
The designers have taken care to incorporate some nice play features into the set. Good use of hinges and rotary lift mechanisms nicely conceal the play features until used. Assembling the tanker trailer was fun, especially as you see how the features work.<br />
The tanker truck is a good, solid build and very playable. The windsock is also surprisingly sturdy as well.<br />
There are stickers, 8 in total, which are primarily labelling. There is one on each fuel drum, 5 on the tanker trailer and 1 on the motorbike.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The windsock adds to the Airport Battle theme and is a nice little piece of scenery. When the pole is knocked, the fuel barrels fly out and windsock falls to the ground. There are two small flame effects which can be put by the exploding barrels. It measures 5 cm long, 3 cm wide and 14 cm tall.<br />
The motorcycle is rather nice with the purple colour scheme. It measures 6 cm long, 1.5 cm wide and 3.5 cm high.<br />
The tanker truck is the star of the set. The cab has easy access by removing the roof panel. There is a hinged joint to the trailer but also a standard trailer coupling underneath so you can attach the baggage trailer from 76051 if wanted. The trailer has a dial on the left hand side. When turned, the top of the tanker explodes upwards, jettisoning the aft plate and flames leap into existence from within. This is a great play feature, easy to reset and adds to the whole battle, especially when thrown by Giant Man. The truck measures 24 cm long, 5.5 cm wide and 6.5 cm tall.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>An excellent set and a must have for any Marvel collector. &nbsp;It nicely rounds out the theme to add to 76047 and 76051, and it&#39;s great for dioramas. The selection of minifgures finishes off both sides for the showdown and the addition of the new Hawkeye and Spider-Man makes this one of the best purchases I&#39;ve made this year.&nbsp;</p>

"A_Brickset_user","2016-08-05T19:06:27.97Z","Small but Perfectly Formed","<p>First of all, let me say I&#39;m sorry for the boring title - someone already took &quot;I thought it was a water truck&quot;, so I was struggling for ideas!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I bought the first three Civil War sets just after seeing the film in late April, and they, like the film, were excellent all round. Then, when this set was revealed in May, I was exceptionally pleased with it - not only did it fill all the gaps in the teams, it was a nice model and reasonably priced. Now I&#39;ve bought it and built it, I can tell you my initial impressions have actually been beaten!</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Pretty standard fare. 2 stapled instruction booklets. I thought the box was a little bit on the small side, but hey, we&#39;re saving the environment here!</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Nothing particularly interesting - the new web piece and accompanying holder, but I&#39;ll get to those later.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>One of the main draws of this set, the figs are all absolutely stunning.</p>

<p>Captain America isn&#39;t new, but is nice nonetheless. I would rather have had an updated minifigure-scale Ant-Man, but there&#39;s still the alleged polybag!</p>

<p>Vision is very similar to his (still excellent) 2015 version, barring that his forehead gem is now the correct yellow colour - the sort of prime treatment I would expect for an infinity stone!</p>

<p>Hawkeye is also new, and excellent as well. The purple looks great and is good and movie accurate. My one complaint would be that he could benefit from a dual-moulded short sleeve on his left arm, and I would have have added one myself, but they are still very rare in the UK - maybe when Ethan Hunt comes out!</p>

<p>Spider-Man is undoubtedly the main draw minifigure-wise, and he does not disappoint - this a no-expense-spared, fully printed and moulded&nbsp;figure, and the finished result is gorgeous - the leg printing/moulding is highly accurate to the brilliant Tom Holland&#39;s boots in the film, the arm printing is also excellent, and the torso and head prints are exceptionally movie accurate as well. This does make Spidey&nbsp;a real challenger for superhero fig of the year, but I still prefer the Silver Centurion.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Short but sweet. You start with the obligatory-to-superhero-sets random smaller models, including a windsock, barrels, and of course, a purple dirt bike. Oh, and the compulsory fire extinguisher. The build then moves on to the front of the truck, then the bottom of the trailer, and finally the top. It&#39;s satisfying to see it take shape, and building the explosion mechanism is very fun, as is adding all the SNOT to give it its rounded shape.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Excellent. The explosion feature works wonderfully and is well hidden, the tanker is accurate to real airports (albeit not to the not-a-water-truck in the movie) and there are enough figs that it functions as a playset in its own right, and not just an add-on to 76051.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I can&#39;t really recommend this set enough. It&#39;s brilliant. With some minor changes,&nbsp;(and a few other sets) you an create a very satisfying and accurate airport battle scene. I&#39;ve swapped Spidey&#39;s web for the white ropes used in earlier sets and wrapped him round Giant-Man, which makes quite a centrepiece to any display!</p>

"Faefrost","2016-12-16T18:58:30.787Z","A great companion set for the airport battle","<p>this is a neat set with some fun play features. It has some great minifigs. It only suffers a bit because the play feature detract a little from the main build. Really it&#39;s purpose is to flesh out the big Airport Battle in Captain America Civil War. This set gives us the three heroes missing from the larger 76051 set. Vision, Hawkeye, and Spider-Man, plus another Captain America. The best of the figs is Spider-Man who Sports the new two color legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main tanker truck build is ...alright... it looks a little awkward as it really needs a second trailer axel. Plus the trailer hooks much too far back on the tractor similarly looking odd. Finally the main action feature revolves around a huge unsightly knob sticking out of the tanker. On the positives it is well shaped with some really neat colors and markings. It also has some destructible terrain and fire bits. The main feature is with a turn of the lever the tanker catches on fire. Cleverly executed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kids will have tons of fun with this. But at the end of the day it really is a value add for 76501, and completes that scene and battle.&nbsp;</p>

"lhustwait","2017-05-01T22:09:36.677Z","Great Addition to 76051 Super Hero Airport Battle","<p><u><strong>Summary:</strong></u></p>

<p>This is a great set that really compliments the Superhero Airport Battle Set. It is an exclusive to Toys R Us and has some minifigs that are only available in this set. I bought this set as I believe it has the potential to become very collectible, whilst being a great set to play with my son.</p>

<p><u>Build: 7/10</u></p>

<p>The build is relatively straightforward. The only bit that required a bit of concentration was the mechanism for the exploding tanker, which because I was watching TV at the same time as assembling, I had to revisit to get right.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Parts / Design: 8/10</u></p>

<p>I think the parts used in the set are great. The yellow colour scheme is great, and the design of the tanker great. It looks like an airport tanker. The explosive barrels are great and the use of stickers isn&#39;t too excessive. I really like the web for Spider-man although not massive fan of the jumping accessory, although this does add to the playability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would also have liked a stand on the motorbike to make it easier to stand unaided.</p>

<p><u>Minifigs: 10/10</u></p>

<p>This is where this set really excels. I was unaware when purchasing the set, but if Brickset is correct, two of the four included figures included in&nbsp;are exclusive to this set, and as the set is an exclusive, these have the potential to be very collectible going forward. (Spider-man and Vision).</p>

<p><strong>Hawkeye:</strong> This is the second version of Hawkeye that I have, and I much prefer this one. The first was a polybag I got free from a newspaper, and whilst it was ok, this is more in line with the Marvel films version. The main difference between the two is the hair. This one gets the hair right. The head is double sided, one with a smiling face and one with an angry face. I have heard criticism of this, but I quite like it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Captain America: </strong>This is the standard Captain America that is available in multiple other sets, and whilst it is a very minifig, its likely that most will already have this, and considering the number of characters present in the airport scene in the film, it would have been nice to see one of the others. However, I won&#39;t complain too much as the Vision and Spider-man make up for it.</p>

<p>Vision: I love this figure. According to Brickset, its is exclusive to this set, and the detail on it is great. I think there is another similar Vision, but from a previous review that I have read, the colours on this set are more accurate. The cape is great, I have not seen this yellow / gold colour before. It is also the soft fabric type, rather than the paper cape that comes with some minifigs.</p>

<p><strong>Spider-man: </strong>This is another gem. Currently (again according to Brickset) only available in this set. This is my fourth Spider-man, the other three all being SH038, so its nice to have a different paint job. Where SH038 is mainly blue, this one is seems to have more red and a darker blue. Its a nice addition to the set.</p>

<p><u>Playability: 9/10</u></p>

<p>I have a great test as to how playable a set is, and it involves letting my 4 year old son play with it. If the set holds his attention, and stays assembled, it gets good points!</p>

<p>Firstly, my son loves this set and it is very playable. There are two main interactive parts, the first being the windsock. You line the two explosive barrels up on the bottom of the windsock, and when it is tipped, the barrels fly out, and there are a couple of flames to spread along the ground as a result of the explosion.</p>

<p>Secondly, the main part is the tanker. There is room in the cab for a driver, or though none is supplied, and the knob on the side can be turned to make the tanker &#39;explode&#39; with the top splitting into two, and three large flames popping up. Also, the end of the tanker pops off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mechanism is well designed, the knob is easy to turn even for my 4 year old, and he was able to quickly reassemble the tanker when he was ready to play again. Add to this Hawkeye&#39;s motorbike, and there is hours of fun to be had. Also, I am very pleased with the method used to attach the trailer to the cab. The tanker as a whole can be driven around with some force and the trailer does not easily come off, unlike the other Lego truck that I have (3221) where this connection is the week part of the design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, the design is very robust, and after an hour of playing with my son, there were no instances where the set broke (except for where intended!).</p>

<p><u>Value for Money: 8/10</u></p>

<p>I got a good deal on this, as I had a free &pound;10 gift card from a recent promotion, and a &pound;10 off &pound;50 spend voucher as well for being a gold card member, but even at full price, I think this is good value for money. With four minifigures and good playability, I think it is one of the better of the recent sets, and its exclusivity can only result in the value of the set increasing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>Why should you buy this set?:</u></p>

<ul>
	<li>Complements the&nbsp;76051: Super Hero Airport Battle set, increasing the playability and allowing you to recreate the Captain America: Civil War airport scene</li>
	<li>Great selection of minifigures that you won&#39;t get in other sets</li>
	<li>If you are interested in buying sets as an investment, this has the potential to increase more than others as exclusive to Toys &#39;R Us</li>

<p>I first saw images of this set on The Brick Fan and as soon as I saw it, I knew I had to get it. Vision and a new Spider-man? A must have set. There were a few disappointments, but I&rsquo;ll talk about those as we go. Minifigures first.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>&nbsp;Well, actually I guess I&#39;ll start here.&nbsp;I don&#39;t rate my sets much on box or instructions. Most box designs look great. It would have been nice to get one of those nifty little comics about this set, but oh well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Vision: I have wanted to get Vision for a long time but I never did because the Quinjet City Chase was too expensive, so when I saw that this set had Vision, I was super excited when this set was revealed. Vision has superb printing and he now has a yellow gem in his head instead of the incorrect blue. His cape is a really nice shiny yellow. The sand green and dark pink paired with the yellow looks amazing. 5/5 stars.&nbsp;<meta http-equiv=""Content-Type"" content=""text/html; charset=UTF-8"" /><meta http-equiv=""Content-Style-Type"" content=""text/css"" /> <meta name=""Generator"" content=""Cocoa HTML Writer"" /><meta name=""CocoaVersion"" content=""1404.47"" />

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/3v2vq9bf7/Vision.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<p>Captain America: here is disappointment #1. Cap again!?!? I mean, come on! Why couldn&rsquo;t it&nbsp;have been a new version of Antman? Oh well. He&rsquo;s a good minifigure if you don&rsquo;t already have him ten times.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/oiwxr979v/Cap_(front).png"" style=""width: 599px; height: 599px;"" /></p>

<p>Hawkeye; disappointment #2. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, Hawkeye is really awesome, but using Cap&rsquo;s face? That was lazy. Come on Lego! You could have done better! I switched out the face for the one shown in my picture below. It sort of looks like the Age Of Ultron Hawkeye face. I wish Lego would just have used one of the previous Hawkeye heads and re-colored the glasses. The body and leg printing is really great though. Also, including a black quiver might have been nice, instead of printing it on his back. 3/5 stars. Could have been better. Now, enough bellyaching about Hawkeye.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/wuxa68u1f/Untitled_2.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>On to Spider-Man!! I&rsquo;ll start with this: 10/5 star minifigure. Yes, 10/5. Lego has outdone themselves with him. Dual color legs, dark blue and red color scheme, arm printing, leg&nbsp;printing and a new web piece. The dark blue looks so much better than the typical lighter blue. The regular version of Spider-Man has a blue torso with red printing, but this one has a red torso with blue printing. The extra red is nice. The printing on the arms show some red with black web printing and a black band. The legs are the first dual color legs with printing that I have seen. The printing is fairly simple, just another black band on each leg and some contour lines. The head is brand new with squinting eyes outlined with silver. The Civil War Spider-Man mini figure is my favorite 2016 minifigure .&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/hwa9y2plf/Spidey.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<h3>The build(s)</h3>

<p>Now, on to the builds. We&rsquo;ve got the tanker truck, the windsock and Hawkeye&rsquo;s motorcycle. We&rsquo;ll start with the motorcycle. It has a silver frame with a purple cover. There is one sticker on the front showing the Avengers logo in silver. The purple color, paired with the dirtbike design looks perfect for Hawkeye. 5/5 stars.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/3nang0b2r/Dirtbike.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<p>The windsock: a simple design, but great. The sock part is built with a 2x2 orange cone and a re-colored chopper astromech droid body. There&rsquo;s a spot to set the two gas tanks labeled with Roxxon stickers. When you launch a super-jumper at it, the windsock topples and flings the tanks. Also included is a few extra flame elements to add to the chaos. Overall a nice&nbsp; build with a fun play feature. If Lego had added a small supply shed attached to it, that might have raised the value a bit, but&nbsp;oh well. They didn&rsquo;t. 5/5 stars. <em>(A quick note on super-jumpers: they are really fun to use if you remove the minifigures correctly. Sometimes in the instructions, they&rsquo;ll show you how to do it right. If not, then watch this video to see how to do it:&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLhY-MXN4iQ"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLhY-MXN4iQ</a>&nbsp; (all the videos on that channel are family friendly. There&rsquo;s also my review for this set on that channel that you might want to check out). </em></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/wm4rdfnkj/Windsock.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<p>Finally, the tanker itself. In my opinion, the whole build is perfect but I&rsquo;ve heard some people say that they hated it. I can&rsquo;t see how anyone could hate it. The colors fit well together, the design is excellent and the function works super well.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/a8ndfrqxf/Tanker01.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 388px;"" /></p>

<p>The amount of butter yellow pieces is epic. I&rsquo;m glad Lego decided to do that rather than the regular yellow.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/lnofy4snn/Tanker03.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 388px;"" /></p>

<p>The cab detaches easily from the the tanker piece. That might bother some people, but it can be remedied quite easily by changing the technic pin. Some of the stickers were a bit tough to get on straight.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/6djzd77rn/Tanker02.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 388px;"" /></p>

<p>On the side, the Roxxon words are made up of two stickers. Rox on one. Xon on the other. Those were somewhat of a challenge. There&rsquo;s also a sticker on a control panel in the cab. That one wasn&rsquo;t as hard. On the side of the tanker is a knob that has a sticker, but that one wasn&rsquo;t really that hard. Above the knob is an exposed stud that could&rsquo;ve used a smooth tile to cover it up, but it&rsquo;s easily overlooked and not a huge deal. If you turn the knob, the tanker explodes and flames shoot up.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/jke0qgsur/Tanker04.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 388px;"" /></p>

<p>The roof of the cab can come off and a minifigure can fit inside. The set doesn&rsquo;t include a driver, but you can easily make one with pretty much any pieces. You can see mine in the picture below.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/y60g0z09f/Driver.png"" style=""width: 500px; height: 440px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;Pros: Spider-Man!</p>

<p>Vision</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons: Captain America</p>

<p>Hawkeye&rsquo;s head</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final notes: You can get the head shown on my Hawkeye in the Star Wars Rebel Alliance battle pack. This is one of the few $30.00 sets with four minifigures. If this set didn&rsquo;t include Spider-Man, then I would give it 4/5 stars. But it does, so&hellip;8/5 stars! A must have for anyone! Now go buy it! Here&#39;s Some more pictures. This is my first review here, so the picture placing&nbsp;is kind of odd.&nbsp;<br />
