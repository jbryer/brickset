<p>What we have here is a fairly accurate representation of the small trains that slowly travel&nbsp;around LEGOLAND parks to let the passengers admire the landmarks made of bricks. However, at&nbsp;LEGOLAND Billund, the original and oldest park,&nbsp;the train has a totally different design. The build is 4 studs wide, whereas the real-world trains are 6 giant studs wide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A train station where all the rides begin and end is included. It features a nice little map of the park which shows the train&#39;s route. You get four pretty ordinary minifigures, some of which have alternate faces. The roof of the car can be removed to let the passengers in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a simple build which you will complete fast, but you will as usual be annoyed by the&nbsp;stickers. You are presented with one locomotive and two cars. If you buy multiple 40166 sets you can easily connect more wagons to make the train more realistic. The model train has very small wheels, but it rolls nicely over most flat surfaces; hence play value is quite good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obviously this set was designed to make you smile---and it succeeds. You will be delighted to see it on display, making you remember your LEGOLAND visit. The childish combination of&nbsp;old-school Lego colors brings back fond building memories from times when Lego builds were a little less complex.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summing up,&nbsp;I think any Lego collector should make it a priority to get this set as a souvenir when visiting a LEGOLAND park.&nbsp;</p>
