<p>Over the years this popular and highly playable theme of small vehicle has developed through many versions of which I have a number of them so when I found out about this latest incarnation I immediately searched one out.</p>

<p>At the time of writing this is not generally available in the UK but I was able to source an example via EBay. &nbsp;I fully expect this will become available over here before too long, probably as part of a promotion.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging is a poly&nbsp;bag of standard size and format and contains an instruction sheet that unfolds to just smaller than A4 size with one and a half sides containing the twelve fairly straightforward instruction stages whilst the rest is the usual montage photo of Lego City with images of various 2016 sets, all being part of the Fire subtheme.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A total of forty five pieces make up the set with the numbers being swelled by a pneumatic drill and a small barrier accompanying the dumper truck and some 1x1 round tiles in dark brown to represent some soil for a load plus the usual duplicate spares for the small parts and tools in the form of a shovel and broom.</p>

<p>It is one of the higher parts counts for this type of vehicle, 607 for example was made up of just 23 parts whilst another predecessor,&nbsp;6507 from 1989 had 30.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifig&nbsp;is nice but nothing outstanding. &nbsp;The &#39;blue dungarees&#39; torso is nicely printed on both sides whilst a surprise is the choice of hat, not the classic ribbed hard hat that has adorned the head of pretty much every construction worker in my collection since 1979&#39;s number 607 set but a modern baseball cap in red.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As per most of these small vehicles and poly bag sets, the build is very straightforward, taking twelve stages. &nbsp;During the build a couple of features in particular caught my attention, the usage of a silver alien gun is used for an exhaust pipe, slotted into the side adjacent to the steering wheel whilst a somewhat bizarre seating arrangement has been provided with a pair of yellow 1x2 plates with centre stud being used to provide the securing point for the driver.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is a nice playable and everyday vehicle, six studs wide thanks to the balloon tyres that has been standard on the most recent incarnations of this vehicle type plus the familiar bucket section, this time in grey rather than yellow which has been more common until now. &nbsp;The tools clipped to the back are also a nice touch and add to the playability.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As the City/Town dumper truck is essentially the Genesis point of my life long enthusiasm for Lego, this latest version was a must have as soon as I found out about it. &nbsp;Having now acquired and built it I do think it is good but has one major weakness, that seating arrangement with the centre stud plates is odd and with the minifig sat on it he does look a bit awkward.</p>

<p>Overall however you can rarely go wrong with a City poly bag for a quick fix of playability but mine will be modified with a proper seat before it is allowed on any construction site and its operator will be getting a regulation hard hat too!!</p>
