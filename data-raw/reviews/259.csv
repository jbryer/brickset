This set has a nice selection of pieces along with one of the cool 'director' minifigs.  I managed to find a few with a really great price and really like them.  Overall, a cheap little set but worth every penny!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-03T02:45:49.92Z","Stephen Spielburg (director) and stunt man!!!","Set cost 4 US dollars and you get two mini figures. The stunt man really flies across the room. You also get some very useful pieces in this small set. It does something (action) and small ones will love sending the stunt man on a trip across the room. It is the only set I know of with Stephen Spielburg in it, its worth buying for that reason only.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"omgbrick","2007-08-09T15:14:44.24Z","Lots of  good pieces.","For 4 dollars this thing is a bargin. The director is pretty cool he looks the part and comes with some nice stuff. The stunt men is great mostly because of his torso and helmet which are very versitile and can be used for soilders or any one you need them to be used for. The little catupult doesn't work very well ( It usally sends the guy straight into the fire). Still it and the fire have lots of good pieces( ladder fire the yellow printed bricks).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"yaraelpoof","2008-08-15T08:38:17.78Z","Awesome set, with an awesome theme!","I loved the studios theme, and any set that went with it. It was no surprise that I loved this set the minute I finished it.a
The stunt man is awesome, and even includes a cool torso. Steven Spieldburg looks cool too with his megaphone in hand. The ladder is used for a catapult that can launch the stuntman over three flames. I love this set and give it a five.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2009-07-14T12:34:34.437Z","works better than it looks","while it has no springs, no rubber bands, and no teeter-totter style lancher, it actually works!! sometimes. you have to quickly push the ladder and the guy flys. not very well usually.

its a small set and an over easy build with barely any pieces. however the director with his board and megaphone it a very cool figure and the other guy is fine too.

the reason it gets a 4 is because it kinda isnt much. both structures feature less than 15 pieces and it really shouldnt be gotten alone. maybe if it came it a bigger set with a lot more stuff it might be really good but it really just looks like a dinky model on the back of the box of an under 10$ set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BionicleBOOM","2009-01-29T16:17:53.403Z","3, 2, 1, and Action!","A really neat little set!  I got this back in 2005 (don't know how I was able to find it to be honest), and still have it to this day.  In fact, it's sitting in front of me on my desk as I type.
This miniature Studios set includes a stuntman in a stunt costume and helmet, Steven Spielberg with a megaphone and clapperboard, and some flames. It's pretty fun to play with, and well worth the money.

Pros:

-Clapperboard

-Steven Spielberg

-Stuntman

-Catapult

Cons:

-None

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-05-26T13:10:57.51Z","LEGO Studios - Stuntman Catapult Review","It's a really small set but it's a great accessory to any the LEGO Studios theme. We get a row of fire and a small catapult. The catapult was actually made out of a basic ladder piece which has a stand for the minifig. We get a clapper board and a megaphone for the director whose face reminds me a little bit of George Lucas. The other figure we get is the stuntman who comes with a black overall and we also get the face of the Rock Raider character Sparks for him which really surprised me.<br><br>The set is built very quickly. O.k.: it's a smaller set. So what do you expect? The way how to launch the minifig is that you have to flick the ladder piece. Quite frankly this feature doesn't work really well but if you're a fan of the LEGO Studios theme or if you need pieces and minifigs for MOC's and brickfilms I would only pick that up if I got the bigger sets first.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good model and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T12:41:48.98Z","Ready for my close-up Mister Spielberg","<p>This is set #1356 Stuntman Catapult. What can one say about this set? It is one of the low price points for the Studios theme, really an impulse set compared to the larger more detailed items from the theme. It is a cheap way to get the Lego version of Steven Spielberg. (And yes, I'm confident that's who the director mini-figure is supposed to represent.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as what you can do with this set... Well to be perfectly honest, not much. The instructions show you how to build the stunman catapult, the flaming stunt thingie (what would you call it precisely?) and of course the little clapper.</p>
<p>On the back of the instructions is a brief alternative model pictured&nbsp;that uses a few of the pieces to make what I suspect to be a stunt ladder for simulated climbing scenes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only drawing point for this set that I can really see is the mini-figures. If you want a director to run around your LEGO City, but don't want to spend money on an expensive Studios set then I suggest going for this one. (Unless you'd just like to pick up the mini-figure on E-Bay or something.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It isn't much fun on its own though, but if you add a few other Studios sets then you'll find that it can be quite amusing. Especially if you have the JP III Studios sets, the Stuntman could be catapulted out of the reach of the dangerous Velociraptors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall rating for the set, 4, but that's mostly due to the mini-figures.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3
