<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set is packaged in a polybag and includes a fold-out instruction paper. Nothing about either of those things is special.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some of the parts of the set are rather large for a polybag, including a 2x8 black plate, two yellow car midsections (the bottoms of the pontoons), and two 3x8 white wing plates.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The single pilot minifig in this set is fairly generic, but looks good nonetheless. The prints on his torso and legs are well done and look great.&nbsp;He is equipped with some handcuffs and a radio, both of which can be clipped onto the seaplane for storage.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build of the seaplane is very short, but very nice. Nothing too advanced about it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The final model looks very nice for what it is. Everything is there, from the twin propellers to the floats on the bottom of the craft. The craft itself is much bigger than it appears in pictures, which is good. The only thing I would ask for is some guidance lights on each of the wings, but that is easily fixed with some red and green transparent 1x1 round plates. The model is also capable of leaning back and staying in a landing/takeoff pose, which I much appreciate.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For $3.99 USD, this set is fantastic. The seaplane looks good and has good playability, as well as looking good on display in a harbor setting. I fully recommend this set, and will keep it in my city harbor proudly.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-07-07T17:48:12.01Z","Terrible Name Choice, Great Polybag.","<p><strong>Set #30346 Prison Island Helicopter:</strong> Another year, another line of LEGO City Polybags and this one is no exception, it&rsquo;s another police based polybag for the Prison Island sub-theme. Read on to hear the pros and cons of the set and then the overall thoughts on whether it&rsquo;s worth getting.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Prison Island Helicopter model is fairly large for a Polybag of this sort with a decent use of pieces and works greatly. Placing the Minifigure on the model is also easy because of the method used for the cockpit attachment.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Police Pilot Minifigure looks very well detailed and includes handcuffs and a walkie-talkie.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Price-Per-Piece ratio is very good here.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Model is rather back-heavy, the tail does not work well as a balancing agent and so the model will fall backwards on the shelf or display very often unless the pilot is in the cockpit.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Cockpit does not lock in very well and can move too much out of joint due to the design of the model.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>This is not a helicopter, this is a small one-person sea plane. Very confusing use of name here.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This is a fairly decent polybag. It&rsquo;s a nice add-on for the Prison Island sub-theme and the design is fairly interesting despite a few minor problems. You can even clip the accessories on either side for storage, I am scratching my head at why LEGO called it a helicopter though. Helicopters typically are vertical take-off and landing craft, this model does not feature a VTOL engine design, the engines are stationary facing forward, which means it should have been called a plane, as that&rsquo;s what it is. It wouldn&rsquo;t be difficult to mod both engines so they could function as VTOL engines with a use of certain moveable parts. Anyway, a decent polybag and I recommend tracking it down if you haven&rsquo;t already added it to your collection.</p>

"vikings","2020-06-01T03:24:43.403Z","Nice Plane (Not Helicopter)","<p>Just going to get this out of the way before I go into to everything else.The name of this set is not accurate as it is not a helicopter but a seaplane.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a polybag&nbsp;with normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some nice parts in this set. You get two black propellers, a white 2x3x2 rudder, a trans blue 2x5x2 cockpit, a black walkie-talkie, and handcuffs. Overall some nice pieces for a polybag. The total piece count for the set is 46.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Police Pilot:</strong></p>

<p>The Police Pilot is a pretty simple figure. He resembles a lot of other cops used in previous sets (I&#39;m referring to the torso and legs). He has a white helmet with a trans grey visor. The officer has a single sided head. The head of the officer has sunglasses over his eyes and a neutral expression for his mouth. The printing on his torso has a badge, a pair of zippers, and a small blank rectangle on the upper left part of his torso. The printing on his legs has a zipper and some sort of map like thing (I can&#39;t tell exactly tell what it is but it looks like a map). The officer has a walkie-talkie and a pair of handcuffs that are equipped on the seaplane. Overall a decent figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a good Lego&nbsp;city polybag. The plane itself is fairly large (for a polybag). It has two propellers on either side of the plane that&nbsp;looks great. There are two clips on either side of the base where you put the walkie-talkie and handcuffs. The cockpit glass piece doesn&#39;t connect the best and isn&#39;t very secure. The look of the plane is really good. The cop is an okay figure to get. He isn&#39;t really distinguishable from&nbsp;a lot of the other cops you get in other sets, so there is nothing there to get excited about. I do recommend this set if you are a Lego city fan or just to add to your Lego collection. This is a nice set for 4 bucks (USD). Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"HuskyDynamics","2020-07-24T20:05:38.037Z","Prison Island Helicopter (not floatplane)","<p>Although this may be the least helicoptery helicopter in the history of helicopters, this set is pretty good for a polybag.&nbsp; It&#39;s a nice twin-engine&nbsp;<strong>helicopter</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;a floatplane) that has a seat for the&nbsp;<strong>helicopter</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;floatplane) pilot while he flies around doing&nbsp;<strong>helicopter</strong>&nbsp;(<strong>still </strong>not floatplane) things.&nbsp; The floats even have attachment points for the pilot&#39;s equipment!</p>

<p>Overall, this set is a good&nbsp;<strong>helicopter </strong>(absolutely isn&#39;t a floatplane), and I would recommend purchasing this if you (or anyone you know) appreciates&nbsp;<strong>helicopters</strong>&nbsp;(but not floatplanes) or simply is a fan of small police sets like this (which is clearly a helicopter and&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;a floatplane).</p>

<p>No chance of this being a floatplane.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; It&#39;s quite the helicopter though.&nbsp; It does helicopter stuff really well.</p>

<p>11/10 for helicoptery-ness</p>
