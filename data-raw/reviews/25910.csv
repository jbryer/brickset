I had seen Just2Good&nbsp;review it, and wanted to get one myself, to add to my city&#39;s growing fire fighting squad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see that this set had a quite nice and very useful printed 2x2 slope piece with the modern day City subtheme fire logo. I will be using this piece in later mocs.</p>

<p>Other then that, I like the inclusion of a trash can, as my city population could always use another place to store their trash. The mini figure is basic, but still nice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I give this set a 9/10. For only 4 US dollars, you get a nice printed piece, and trash can, and a good assortment of red pieces.</p>
