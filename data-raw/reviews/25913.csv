<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The clamshell box is a nice touch.&nbsp; The front has a nice image of the guard and it folds out to show a nice little depiction of the Nexo Knight&#39;s sci-fi/fantasy countryside.&nbsp; The blend of the two genres has intrigued me since the first pictures of the first wave came out last year because it reminds me of what I always imagined as a kid playing with my Castle and Space Legos at the same time.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The only parts are for the minifig</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifig is very detailed for a generic character.&nbsp; His legs have intricate armor plates printed on the front.&nbsp; This printing carries onto the front of the torso.&nbsp; The back of the torso is also printed with what appear to be overlapping plates to protect the guard&#39;s spine.&nbsp; The chest has the King&#39;s crest.&nbsp; The shoulder plates are nicely detailed and have studs on the back to attach accessories or bricks (not included) and a cutout in the front to allow the crest to show through.&nbsp; The head is two-sided, with a concerned look on one side and an angry grimace on the other.&nbsp; While wearing the helmet, only the eyes are visible, but the two expressions do have distinctly different eyes so that works.&nbsp; The only negative thing I can say is that mine was a little loose in the connection between the legs and the torso; the legs did not lock in as securely as most minifigs.&nbsp; Since I only have one of these, I don&#39;t know if that is common for all of them or if I got one that was a little off.&nbsp; It is still tight enough that the legs don&#39;t just fall off, so I can live with that.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The minifig comes pre-built, so there is no real&nbsp;&quot;build&quot; to this at all.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>See minifigure section</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As I said in the beginning, I like this minifig and am very happy with my first Nexo Knights addition to my collection.&nbsp; I certainly wouldn&#39;t mind getting my hands on a few more to make a nice little entourage of futuristic guards.&nbsp;</p>
