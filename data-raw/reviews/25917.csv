"andyh1984","2016-05-30T21:37:49.443Z","My favourite Â£20 set","<p>I wanted&nbsp;this set from the moment I saw the advance pictures as I really like the character Ghost Rider but had thought that (along with Punisher) he was a bit too violent in comics to fit the child friendly Lego criteria for a set. Ghost Riders motorbike is the star of the three builds but the others give something for each Minifigure, a flyer for Hobgoblin and a traffic light that you can attach Spiderman to the side without the lights on.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is very eyecatching&nbsp;on the shelf and the instructions&nbsp;are good/clear as you would expect, you build the glider then the traffic light then the motorbike so the highlight is the finale to the build.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are some parts that are unique (I think) which are the flame elements on the bike, also&nbsp;the street light and glider contain&nbsp;some brighter colours to contrast with the mostly black and flame orange bike</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>These are great, Ghost rider is excellent he has flame showing through&nbsp;his&nbsp;leather jacket but plain black legs also his &quot;hairpiece&quot; is permanently attached to his head (so his head is one sided)&nbsp;maybe the trans-orange piece&nbsp;is fragile when separate? he also has a flame orange chain accessory, Spiderman is an older Minifigure but they are probably waiting for the 2017 Spiderman film to do&nbsp;an update he has a web accessory that connects to a sort of stud with handle that I haven&#39;t seen before (there was a spare in my set), Hobgoblin is a nice different baddie and his orange and purple colour scheme look suited to the set in a way Green Goblin might not, he has a double sided head Grinning and snarling) a tattered cape and a pumpkin bomb</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>&nbsp;Hobgoblins glider looks nice&nbsp;with purple wings that contrast against his mostly orange Minifigure&nbsp;and a black front that&nbsp;kind of simulates a bat head.</p>

<p>The traffic light has two newspaper racks (for the Daily Bugle and Frontline) in red and blue and street sign/traffic light in yellow and green&nbsp;, Spidey can be attached to the side of the traffic light with the back of his legs.</p>

<p>Ghost Riders bike is the star of the set and is an enjoyable build for the set size and the flame elements are very nice, the pieces are mostly black, grey&nbsp;and red.</p>

<p>Stickers are for the newspapers the street signs and the sides of the newspaper racks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>The three pieces look nice either separate&nbsp;or together and would add to any super hero street scene</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Excellent set for the money and a great way to get three good characters, I usually break down my sets after a few days but I enjoy looking at this so it may stay up a while.</p>

"davy_jones","2016-06-02T16:38:28.863Z","Epically great flaming debut","<p>Some Lego sets a rational acquisitions while others are emotional ones, rarely does a set come along where one finds uncontrollable impulse urging the purchase and then being extremely satisfied with the money spent. This is one such set which is definitely worth investing in.</p>

<p>The Good:</p>

<p>1) The set delivers absolute bang for buck. While Spiderman precedes on the set name, it is Ghost Rider who steals the show. This is truly an epic way to make a minifig debut as flamboyant as the character himself. Ghost Rider is given a look that is an amalgam of the Danny Ketch look from the comics and the movie version. His flaming chain has to be one of the best minifig accessories.....ever. Ghost Rider simply trumps almost all other minifigs on cool factor alone. Doing his best to keep up is Hobgoblin and manages to keep his own. The color scheme for Hobgoblin&#39;s minifig is spot on and the minifig comes with dual printed head piece. While Spidey, who is supposed to be the titular hero is mentioned last in this review, it doesn&#39;t mean the minifig is inferior in any way; just too normal to keep up with the other two. But he does get a new web piece which is awesome.</p>

<p>2) Two vehicles are actually part of this set. Ghost Riders legendary flaming motorcycle is an interesting build that even uses some technic pieces. While the size may be a tad too large, one really shouldn&#39;t care when it looks epically awesome just sitting there parked. Hobgoblin gets his own flyer which is inspired by the comics and increases set playability with its shooting missiles.</p>

<p>3) The set actually can support its own story as it comes complete with props such as a street lamp for Spidey to swing from or Hobbie to destroy, newspaper dispensers, a trash can with trash and Hobbie&#39;s jack-o-lantern faced bombs.</p>

<p>The Bad:</p>

<p>Nothing. You don&#39;t want to get penance stared, do you?</p>

<p>The Verdict:</p>

<p>I had said in my opener that it was worth getting so go ahead folks, let&#39;s celebrate the rider&#39;s debut.</p>

"Deathcakes","2016-08-11T14:35:51.98Z","Of flame, pumpkin and cobweb","<p>Ghost Rider, Hobgoblin, Spider-Man, flames, bikes, gliders, webs, grenades... What&#39;s not to like?! I picked this set up at the only official Lego store in Sweden. When possible I pick up sets&nbsp;affiliated with films I see at the same mall. This time I got this set and then went to see Suicide Squad.</p>

<p>...What? Yeah, yeah - I know, I know... Oh&nbsp;shush, you!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box follows the new standard of the 2016 Spider-Man sets. The changes, as I see them, are: They changed the brick-spidey in the upper right corner for&nbsp;a &quot;realistic&quot; comic-book looking Spider-Man. The minifigure&nbsp;&quot;dashboard&quot; has been placed on the left instead of the right and they also ditched the &quot;Ultimate&quot;-bit. These new sets are thus just &quot;Spider-Man&quot; sets.</p>

<p>Aside from this nothing is really new, you&#39;ve got the presentation on the front, details on the back, a minifig scale up top.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions are as always quite clear. The only piece I had a problem with was the black half-dome with wings (nr&nbsp;4218581). In the instructions it was really hard to see which way that particular piece was meant to go on. However it becomes quite clear after assembling that part you&#39;re working on. I was also a bit confused as to how far I was meant to bend the back of the seat and the &quot;hood&quot; of the bike. However that too became obvious after a while as the Ghost Rider couldn&#39;t sit down in his seat or that the hood was in the way of the &quot;forks&quot; of the front&nbsp;wheel.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>First off, the only parts I&#39;m not really satisfied&nbsp;with is the sand beige&nbsp;connector parts in the middle of the wheels. Considering how pretty much the whole bike (except for the flames) are black, dark grey or light grey these connector parts just pop out too much. It&#39;s a little thing but it would&#39;ve made a difference in my opinion.</p>

<p>Other than that there&#39;s not much I can really say about the parts. However there are a couple of new-ish&nbsp;elements in here: The purple parts of Hobgoblins glider, Spider-Mans cone shaped web, &#39;Goblins grenade and the traffic light post. The latter two did surprise me to be new. The Goblin Grenade could easily have been a Halloween/horror themed part but I do appreciate that they took the time to craft a new one that perhaps suited the Goblin better. The traffic light post surprised me not only in that it&#39;s a new part for this year but that it was there, because I had just&nbsp;expected the post to be made of more individual bricks.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Ah, the minifigures! Now then, if you&#39;ve had a set since 2012 that featured a regular Spider-Man then chances are you&#39;ve already got the Spidey that&#39;s in here. Don&#39;t get me wrong - It&#39;s a good design, so why change it? However I kinda do wish that they&#39;d make the red-booted Spider-Man the standard. The amount of blue on the Spidey in this (and many other) sets&nbsp;just strike me as a bit too much. Spider-Mans suit is a well balanced mix of blue and red and the boots would offset the blue by a healthy amount.</p>

<p>Now to the new guys on the block - Ghost Rider and Hobgoblin! Both of these are brand new minifigs we haven&#39;t seen before, which is exciting!</p>

<p>Where to start? Let&#39;s go for the villain in the set and have a look at Hobgoblin. First thing I noticed was that they gave him boots! I feel bad for Spider-Man now... Anyway, besides this being a new figure there&#39;s another reason as to why I&#39;m happy to see Hobgoblin in the Lego family: He was always one of my favorite villains in Spider-Man! &quot;Why, was it because of his personality or relation to Spider-Man?&quot;, you ask. No, he just looked cool and weird! I don&#39;t even know anything about his personality, he just looked awesome and I&#39;m happy to report that he does so in Lego-form as well!</p>

<p>There are a couple of things that are nitpicky but annoyed me a little anyway: His suits blue parts of not scaled, as it is represented in many sources. His satchel, while present, is printed on the back. I realize that this is the only place to put it but it&#39;s hidden by the cape, which is a shame. While we&#39;re on the subject of the cape - While really cool with it&#39;s tattered edges and holes I really wish they could&#39;ve made it out of the new felt-like material rather than the old, rigid, non-floppy material. Capes are supposed to be floppy!</p>

<p>Then we have the Ghost Rider, AKA Johnny Blaze I think? Although we do not get to see the person beyond the &#39;rider, the &#39;rider himself is plenty! I was a bit worried that the Riders suit (black leather jacket and pants) would be kinda&nbsp;boring to see but luckily that is not the case - The overall design is pretty straightforward with some pockets, zippers and whatnot. Then the fun details begin to show when you look closer: First, the Ghost Riders signature chain is strapped around his jacket and waist, which is a really good design because it cuts the jacket off from the simple solid black pants. Another look reveals the torn up holes in the jacket and through them we can see the fire burning beneath!</p>

<p>The other signature feature of the Ghost Rider is the ever-burning skull! This feature is of course represented in the set, although in a way I was not quite expecting: Instead of just having a skull head piece with a fire-wig attatched, the whole thing is one sculpted (or glued together) part! Not exactly disappointing but fire-hair would&#39;ve been a nice addition to your arsenal when doing random character builds.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was pretty straightforward, no special operation needed. There were stickers (*gasp!*) but they were all meant for surfaces that made it quite easy to center them so I managed alright. They went on the street signs, the newspaper dispensers and the newspapers themselves. Signs always freak me out a bit when it comes to stickers because I feel that they should be pretty straight. The newspaper are kind of more forgiving because if you see a newspaper it&#39;s not really always straight. They&#39;re folded weird or have fallen and gotten crooked and it&#39;s fine.</p>

<p>It&#39;s been a while since I bought a set that&#39;s just not a figure and some accessory so I was actually impressed by how the bike was put together and how narrowly the fire parts are to the wheels without being able to touch it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The models that come in this set is divided in three - A street corner with traffic lights and newspaper dispensers, the Hobgoblins air glider and the Ghost Riders motorcycle. In my opinion these three are&nbsp;just a treat in so many ways - The streetcorner is a neat little addition to pretty much any contemporary setting, be it a simple City themed display or your coolest super-hero battles. The glider is not very big or advanced but it doesn&#39;t need to be. It&#39;s a small tech device meant for taking the Hobgoblin around and taking the Spider out.&nbsp;It&#39;s got wings for the former and missiles for the latter! Since I don&#39;t really play with my sets I tend to just turn the missile&quot;bodies&quot;&nbsp;around and instead make it into a turret looking weapon.</p>

<p>Then we have the piece de res... Piece... Bah! We have the big bad a**&nbsp;motorcycle! The Ghost Riders personal carrige is suitably something that seems taken straight out of a heavy metal song or album cover. My initial reaction was that the MC needed more flames, cause that&#39;s what the &#39;Rider is all about. However in the long run I think this design is just delicious in not only how it looks pretty darn good on its own but also in how they&#39;ve balanced flame and machine. Like I mentioned earlier, I would&#39;ve liked to see the beige connector part to be grey instead as it just would&#39;ve followed the bikes overall colour-scheme better.</p>

<p>I was also a bit skeptical about the big red bits coming out at the sides by each wheel. &quot;This will just look silly...&quot; I thought to myself as I continued to build. However when the flames got on there, they flowed really well as the red in the connector bits flowed into the flame bit quite naturally.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall I&#39;d say that this is a pretty great set. You get never before seen figures, you get some brand new parts, display-worthy vehicles. Like I mentioned earlier, I don&#39;t really play with my sets but I can certainly see the play value coming into play here. Spider-Man launched from the super jumper to get face-to-face with the airborne Hobgoblin while the Ghost Rider is ready to give chase on his cool looking motorcycle.</p>

<p>Considering how much I just love how the motorcycle looks, the nostalgia of the Hobgoblin and some great new pieces the price is maybe not the best but I feel that I got my fill with this one!</p>

"ChubsnFlubs","2016-07-10T18:38:06.74Z","Hobgoblins Prey","<p>As a teenager who at the moment doesn&#39;t have a job, it&#39;s hard to buy expensive sets on a regular basis. So when I first saw the new Spider Man summer sets, I thought I would have to give it a miss. But as soon as I saw the Spider Man Ghost Rider team up set, I thought it was a must have. I was not wrong.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is fairly average, depicting a fight scene between the three figures and the builds of the set. Inside are two bags , a relatively thin instructions booklet and one small sticker sheet which focuses on details on the curb/crossroad build thing.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There were a couple of pieces here that were new to me here, including a new part for the traffic lights and bits and pieces in ghost riders bike. But my favourite part is what clips the webbing to spider mans hand. It can be use for many things, and is generally something useful. Hope to see more of this piece.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Undoubtedly the best part of the set is the minifigures. Spider-Man is the same generic figure we&#39;ve seen for a while, and could use with an update, but the other figures make up for it. Ghost Rider is absolutely amazing. Despite there being no printing on the legs, the detail on the torso is amazing, which includes chains wrapped around the body and flames escaping through rips in his jacket. His head is one moulded piece, which I kind of annyoying, but still looks really awesome. As in really awesome. He could possibly be my favourite figure. And then there is The Hobgoblin. The ripped orange cape matched with an amazing double sided head with an evil grin and angry face matched with a detailed body would be nice enough, but the duel moulded legs really bring the character together. As someone who recognise Hobgoblin from the comics, I can confirm they captured the character perfectly in Lego form.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not particularly excting, I&#39;ll be honest. I mean, it was cool to see the bike come together, because some of the techniques were different, but the rest was just simple builds to get from point a to point b. It took me about 30 minutes to build it, but again, I am a slow builder.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Luckily, the complete model makes up for the uninspired build. The glider is bulky, but it&#39;s still nice to look at. The main problem is the flick fire missiles. I don&#39;t think Lego can go one set without including that feature. It&#39;s totally unnecessary, but you can look over that flaw to see a fairly good build. The corner is there mainly to fill up the set, however, it can be incorporates into other themes, it a not an eyesore, and the references to the comics are an excellent touch. Lego make up for the missiles with their superb attantion to detail. And then others the bike. People say it&#39;s too big. I love it. The size just makes the character look more awesome, and the flames are really quite majestic (the flames on the model are a new piece, I believe). The way it is built was strange, and consisted of many different sections, but it came together quite nicely.it&#39;s a really nice representation (getting tired of the word nice) and brings the set together.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For &pound;20, this set is worth every penny. Playability is good, and the figures are awesome. A cheap must buy, as simple as that.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Standard small kit box. Spidey is the figure of choice on the top. The front shows a battle scene between the three characters. The back shows more of the battle scene with panels wit show off the play features.<br />
There is one instruction book and the standard mini comic book as well.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The average per piece ratio for a kit of this size.<br />
There are two bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains the scenery piece with the traffic lights and newspaper boxes, Hobgoblin and his glider, some explosion effects and Spider-man with his super jumper.<br />
Bag 2 contains Ghost Rider and his motorcycle.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with Spider-Man, Hobgoblin and Ghost Rider.<br />
Spider-Man is nothing particularly special and nothing sets the figure apart from other versions. However. The web spray piece which you can attach to his hand is very good.<br />
The Hobgoblin is a great figure. The colour and detailing are excellent. He has a double sided head with a laughing face on one side and an angry face on the other. His cloak is particularly well done and captures the torn look quite nicely. He comes armed with a trademark pumpkin bomb and 2 flame on disc effects to represent exploded ones.<br />
Finally, we get to the best figure of the bunch, Ghost Rider. This figure is excellent. The detailing on the figure, even down to showing the hell fire underneath, is superb. The skull and hair are all moulded as one piece and look great. He also comes with his &#39;glowing&#39; chain to ensnare his enemies.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 15 minutes.<br />
Nothing unusual in the build and it&#39;s a pretty straightforward kit with regards to construction.&nbsp;<br />
The scenery piece does contain 8 stickers (the signs, news box sides and one on each newspaper bundle) and he dustbin contains bones and vegetable bits to spill out when knocked over.<br />
The Goblin Glider is nicely done and quite well realised, given the scale.&nbsp;<br />
The best by far is Ghost Rider&#39;s motorcycle. It&#39;s a good, solid build and the use of angular plates and Technic pieces lend themselves to the design very well.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The scenery is a nice piece and great for expanding your dioramas. A shame that it doesn&#39;t have traffic lights on all four sides though. However, the discs are so abundant as spares in other sets you can change this yourself.<br />
The Goblin Glider is fun and comes armed with 2 flick missiles. The wings and side plates are positionable. Nice to have some more purple parts. It measures 5 cm long, a maximum of 8 cm wide and 2.5 cm high.<br />
Finally, the motorcycle steals the show. The use of angles and 8 flame effects effectively convey the feel of the machine. Nice wide rubber tyres give a lot of stability and easy play. It measures 17 cm long, 5 cm wide and 4 cm high.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A fantastic little set and well worth the &pound;20 price tag just for being able to have a Ghost Rider figure in my Marvel collection. Easily adds to any of your other Marvel sets, especially if you&#39;re collecting the Web Warriors series.&nbsp;</p>

"WaffleKing","2016-07-27T00:20:36.477Z","Fantastic Fight!","<p>I went on vacation to Holland, and since they are close to Denmark, they had the summer sets early. I really wanted the Harvest of Fear set, but I chose this set because it was the smallest set of the summer wave, thus making it easier to carry in the airport. Was it worth choosing this set over the Harvest of Fear set? Read on to find out!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has nice details, but nothing too special. 3/5</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are great! The glider is composed of some nice purple parts, and the motorcycle has some really good fire pieces! Even if you are not a fan of Technic (like me), this set doesn&#39;t have too many Technic pieces. The lamppost piece is cool too. 4/5</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are easily the star of this set. Hobgoblin is really awesome, sharing his dual-molded boot with Deathstroke. He comes with a pumpkin bomb. Spider-man is the same old spidey as 2012. I would have liked red/blue dual-molded boots on spidey, but two sets of dual-molded legs in a $20 set is just fantasy! Ghost rider is cool, but he does have the most flaws of any figure in this set. I would&#39;ve appreciated some leg printing or him, because his lack of leg printing makes him look like he is wearing a full body suit. His flames are molded onto his head, limiting the possibilities of using the head/flames. Even with these minor flaws, I absolutely love these minifigures! 5/5</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The builds for the motorcycle and the street corner are pretty boring an uninspired. I did take guilty pleasure in building the glider, though. I like building smaller vehicles. If you don&#39;t though, you should probably like the motorcycle. 2/5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is pretty nice. I feel it is a good set for display, or for play. It is following the pattern of other great $20 superhero sets. Three cool figures, one larger vehicle, one smaller vehicle, and one bit of scenery.&nbsp; 4/5</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>When this set comes out in retail, absolutely get this set! At a score of 18/25, I give this set a B!</p>

"sudorum","2016-12-16T21:35:57.827Z","Hobnobbing with the Hobgoblin","<p>To my knowledge Hobgoblin and Ghost Rider have never encountered each other in the comics, but there&#39;s a first for everything and I suppose this Lego set&nbsp;is it. The minifigures are just about perfect. Hobgoblin looks like he just flew out of the 1980&#39;s on his goblin glider, and I love that Lego chose to include his&nbsp;signature smirk with upturned eye expression.&nbsp;Lego has also chosen to bend time a bit&nbsp;and include what appears to be a&nbsp;1990&#39;s&nbsp;rendition of&nbsp;Ghost Rider (judging by his motorcycle design). I was surprised/slightly disappointed that the ball of fire blazing&nbsp;on Ghost Rider&#39;s head isn&#39;t a separate head piece and therefore can&#39;t be removed, but it&#39;s not a big deal and doesn&#39;t detract from the minifigure itself. Ghost Rider&#39;s swirling&nbsp;chain is a character&nbsp;necessity&nbsp;that takes the Lego form of an orange translucent chain. Ghost Rider&#39;s bike is oversized for minifigure scale&nbsp;and is closer to the size of a car,&nbsp;but I suppose the alternative would be a generic bike piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The street corner with two mailboxes and a stop light is a nice addition, if not awe inspiring in its construction. Too bad for the blokes on&nbsp;Bleecker street though... I doubt that&nbsp;a combination of Ghost Rider&nbsp;hellfire and pumpkin bombs is&nbsp;very appealing, least of all to residents&nbsp;who have to worry about fire trucks navigating through Manhattan traffic.&nbsp;</p>

There&rsquo;s even some nice set dressing included for action shots in LEGO Brick Films. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Read on and find out the good points and the not so good ones for the set.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Box: The box is standard fare from LEGO Marvel Super Heroes. The front image showcases the set brilliantly and there&rsquo;s a lot of shots in the back. This set features a Super Jumper, one of the only few to still rely on that piece.</p>

<p>Instructions: The manual is standard fare from LEGO and as is typical breaks the instructions up between the numbered bags in the set. I believe LEGO refers to this as Modular Design, though there really isn&rsquo;t anything modular here compared to typical modular sets. There are no difficult elements here.</p>

<p>Comic: Focusing on the Spider-Man sets from this wave the little comic book shows off everything in a fun and enjoyable fashion and includes a Minifigure checklist for the wave.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This set includes a few nice parts. The most useful of which are the new hand accessories for Super Heroes, with a stud on one side and a bar to hold on the other these versatile little beauties offer the opportunity for so much more. There are also a lot of nice flame pieces in the set which attach to the bike and a Nexo Power Shield in plain black. Really fun and versatile parts to be had.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Ghost Rider: This Minifigure looks astonishing. His torso is dual-sided with chains and Hellflame visibly leaking out from underneath the torn jacket. His head is a brand new unique piece which has permanent flames attached, so it&rsquo;s a single sided print with a skull on the front, he&rsquo;s smiling for his expression. His accessory is a flame-orange chain piece so he can lash out at those who are guilty.</p>

<p>Hobgoblin: This is a fun looking villain for Spidey to fight. He&rsquo;s got some great printing with a dual-sided torso revealing belts and pouches as well as the armour underneath. His legs are dual-molded with the top being dark blue and the bottom being orange. His face is double-sided with a cackling evil expression on one side and an angry at being defeated expression on the other.</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s got a ratty looking orange cape, which I think is re-used from The Hobbit Theme&rsquo;s Witch-King. And his accessory is a printed Minifigure head with jack-o-lantern pattern and a flame sticking out to represent his pumpkin bomb.</p>

<p>Spider-Man: Spidey is the same as we&rsquo;ve come to expect for his Minifigure. The biggest change to him is the new accessories, the new single studed clip piece allows him to attack with a brand new webbing accessory showing it flowing out in a wide stream as he&rsquo;s about to ensnare his current Rogue&rsquo;s Gallery Villain.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Bag 1: Spider-Man and Hobgoblin begin their battle at the corner of Bleeker St. and Fourth Ave. and you get to build that action scene with this bag. There isn&rsquo;t a lot involved with this portion of the build, there is of course the street signs with traffic light, garbage can and paper dispensers. And the Goblin Glider, which is the most fun portion of this build in my opinion, I definitely like this glider compared to past models we&rsquo;ve seen.</p>

<p>Bag 2: Ghost Rider joins the battle with his motorcycle, he&rsquo;ll need to build it first naturally and that&rsquo;s where you come in. This portion of the build is relatively easy to follow. As with most builds of these sorts you work in sections, each section is very straightforward and hardly requires much that would concern an experienced builder. The biggest trouble spot would be the wheels as there are quite a number of Technic elements used here that require axles to be pushed through three or more various sizes of Technic plates.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Ghost Rider&rsquo;s Motorcycle: This is a vast improvement over the bikes found over in the DC set with similar price point. While there are still a lot of Technic elements used to build this, the regular bricks and overall design in construction make up for it. Also as Ghost Rider is known for his off-the-wall looking motorcycle I&rsquo;d hesitate to say that this is even too tame compared to what we&rsquo;ve seen in the comics. Not enough flames or other elements.</p>

<p>Still this is a great looking motorcycle and offers up some truly impressive looking design cues, from the front, the side all around this bike truly speaks to me and the model could have been a lot worse. Just look at what Harley got in Gotham City Cycle Chase.</p>

<p>Hobgoblin&rsquo;s Glider: This little model is all kinds of awesome. You&rsquo;ve got two flick-fire missiles to launch at the heroes and a solid looking Goblin Glider. I can safely say it&rsquo;s ten times better than the old Studios based Movie version I used to own. That is to be expected with the increase in available parts to use and better design options for one of these things.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous: A street light on a corner is what you get with this portion of the parts count. There&rsquo;s a trash can on the side and two newspaper holding machines with bundles of Daily Bugle papers inside, represented by printed 1x2 tiles. Compared to the similar model seen in one of the LEGO DC Sets this is a bit of an improvement, as the paper is secure and not lose so it doesn&rsquo;t fall around or get lost.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a couple of flame elements on radar dishes to represent enemy fire from Hobgoblin. I love the fact that with this and the LEGO TMNT Karai Bike set you have two street signs for New York City, true they&rsquo;re stickers, but should you own them both they&rsquo;d make for great display elements in a LEGO New York Heroes display.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>All I can say is this set is a must own set and I strongly recommend it. Spider-Man isn&rsquo;t anything new, but the others, especially Ghost Rider drive this set up high on my must own Marvel Super Heroes list. The motorcycle model is excellently designed, even if it is a bit large, and the villain is a great looking character too. Strongly recommended.</p>

"Faefrost","2016-12-19T02:39:21.98Z","Fantastic Value and amazing Ghost Rider Minifig","<p>This is a great sub $20 Marvel set. In fact possibly the best at this price point that we have seen in awhile.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box and Instructions -&nbsp;</strong>The box art is striking and catches your eye. The instructions are as usual simply stuffed in the box to wrinkle. There is a very small sticker sheet. But it has great play and modeling value. I think even those normally averse to stickers will consider using them for this one. The stickers are the street signs designating the location of our scene as the corner of Second Ave and Bleeker St. As well as creating some rolled up newspapers and newspaper boxes for The Dailly Bugle and Frontline papers.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures -&nbsp;</strong>The best part of this set. The three minifigs, with two distinct to this set.</p>

<p>Spider-Man - Just our regular old Spider-Man. The common one without the two color legs. He is however improved by having the new 3mm stud piece that lets the figs hold all sorts of things and the new spraying web piece.</p>

<p>Hobgoblin - A great fig. In all his blue and orange glory. He has dual colored legs, front back printing a nicely tattered cloak and I believe the first time we have gotten the hood piece in orange. He also has a flaming pumpkin bomb to throw. About the only thing bad about him is his face is kind of lacking something that I can&#39;t quite put my finger on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ghost Rider - The centerpiece of this set is the new magnificent Ghost Rider figure. he is wonderful. He is unique in that his head is two seemingly glued together parts. The flames are not simply a hair piece as we expected. Rather they are permanently attached to the skull head. The result is quite impressive as his flaming head looks much better than the piece used for Heatwave in the Agents 2.0 line. The mold will also work well should they ever make a Human Torch figure. The body is nicely detailed with front and back and leg printing. He includes a nice trans orange chain for his weapon. He is one of the most distinct and eye catching figures Lego has yet produced. He will find a permanent place in your display.</p>

<p><strong>Parts -&nbsp;</strong>There are some really nice parts in this one. Moreso than normal for a $19 set. You have the already mentioned Orange Hood and Trans Orange Chain. Ghostriders unique head. Tons of nice dual color flame pieces. A nice black Nexo Knight Shield tile. The 3mm grip studs and the web piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Model/Build -&nbsp;</strong>The main build is Ghost Riders flaming chopper. And it is quite well executed. It&#39;s a normal Lego oversized chunky motorcycle, not unlike the various Bat Man Cycles and Ninjago ones. But this is one of the best of the breed, with some really clever lines and technics. The bike also makes some clever uses of color as the red technics pieces blend in well as mounts for the fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Hobgoblin gets a small glider. It has a pair of flick fire missiles and is otherwise pretty unremarkable. It does the job and gives him his expected ride to swoop around on.</p>

<p>Finally there is a nice chunk of street scenery that is remarkably detailed and useful. It is a corner of pavement with a Traffic Light with street signs and the above mentioned newspaper&nbsp;vending machines. It is a great little build. Even better the components are really great for adding detail to a City or Modular display. The Bleeker Street sign can be particularly useful for those seeking to do a bit of MOC&#39;ing. For those not aware 177A Bleeker Street is the Greenwich Village address of the Sorcerer Supreme, Dr. Strange.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall -&nbsp;</strong>Just a fantastic set with incredible value for the price. From parts to figures to just all around usefulness. This set is a must have for the Marvel Collector. And what kid doesn&#39;t like a flaming demonic skeleton as the hero? When you have a small inexpensive set in which Spider-Man is the most boring thing in it, you&#39;ve got a good set.&nbsp;</p>

"IJS07","2017-03-12T22:35:21.89Z","GHOST RIDER!!!","<p>When I first saw that Ghost Rider would be making an appearance in Lego, I was thrilled. I saved up all of my money to get this along with a bunch of the other summer Marvel released.&nbsp;I ordered it&nbsp;the same it&nbsp;was released: August 1st&nbsp;(I know, I&#39;ve waited a really long time to review it).&nbsp;Was all of my excitement worth it? Read on to find out.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong>The box is standard size for a $20 Lego set. The front has an overall image of what&#39;s in the set while the back shows some of the play features. The instructions are just the&nbsp;typical size and is relatively thin.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong>There are 217 pieces. Some of the notable parts include the orange hood for Hobgoblin and Ghost Rider&#39;s head piece, as the flaming hair is attached to his head as all one piece. There is also the new web spray piece.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong>The build took me about 30 minutes at a moderate pace. It contained&nbsp;no complex steps (at least for me).</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong>There are 3 minifigures in the set:</p>

<p><strong>Spiderman:&nbsp;</strong>Spiderman is just the typical, standard Spiderman you see in every set. Nothing new except for that he is equipped with the new web spray part. Spiderman is due for a much needed update, hopefully sometime soon. In the meantime there is the Spiderman from set 76067 Tanker Truck Takedown. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Hobgoblin:&nbsp;</strong>Hobgoblin is an interesting choice for the villain as he is not very well known. None the less he is still an excellent minifigure. The bright orange color contrasts really well with the dark blue. I like the cape used for him as I think it adds to the overall figure. His torso is&nbsp;printed with a reddish-brown belt. He has two facial expressions: One with a crazed smile and the other with an angry face. He also has a flaming pumpkin bomb and there are some flames to illustrate destruction.</p>

<p><strong>Ghost Rider:&nbsp;</strong>Ghost Rider is undoubtedly the main draw for this set. His torso is printed with a chain stretched across it and there are little holes in the jacket as well. Sadly there is no printing on the legs. He is equipped with a flaming chain.&nbsp;I love the head piece though as it looks marvelous on him. It is strange that the flaming hair is attached to the head in all one piece. This is peculiar as I don&#39;t see why this is done. All in all though this doesn&#39;t really matter unless you would have liked to use it for MOCs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:&nbsp;</strong>There are three main parts to the set: Hobgoblin&#39;s glider, the little street corner, and Ghost Rider&#39;s motorcycle. First up is Hobgoblin&#39;s glider. The purple color is looks nice and I like the engine in the back. The glider looks bulky overall though. This may be because of the missiles. It&#39;s nice that it is different then Green Goblin&#39;s glider from 76057 Web Warrior&#39;s Bridge Battle as making them the same would just be lazy. Overall though it isn&#39;t that bad.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Next we have the little street corner. It is a relatively small build, but it contains a lot of great detail. At the bottom there is a gray trash can that has some little pieces of trash inside it. There is also two newspaper bins: A Daily Bugle one that has a newspaper saying `Spider Menace` on it and a Frontline newspaper with the headline `Vulture Preys Over City`. There are two white 2x1 tiles in each one has a sticker&nbsp;with a little folded newspaper with the headline on it. These look really great, almost like the real thing. I also love the reference to the Vulture since he comes in set 76059 Doc Ock&#39;s Tentacle Trap. Next to the newspaper bins is a street light. The two street signs are Second Avenue and Bleecker&nbsp;Street. Sadly, Bleecker is spelled wrong and Second Avenue and Bleecker Street don&#39;t actually share a corner. At least the effort was put in though since these are both important places in the Marvel Universe, for example, Bleecker street is the location of Dr. Strange&#39;s Sanctum Sanctorum. I wonder if this was just coincidence or if this was on purpose since Dr. Strange&#39;s Sanctum Sanctorum was released at the same time. Overall this is a great little addition to the set.</p>

<p>Since Ghost Rider is known for riding his Hell Cycle, it is important that this is done correctly. Luckily it looks amazing and really accurate. The flames are incorporated into the model really well and look great. There really isn&#39;t any visible gaps in the spacing between the wheels. I love the use of the Nexo&nbsp;Knights shield piece and the tiny spikes for the handle bars. I love the seat rest as I think it looks really cool. The two different size tires add a lot of detail to the set as well. If I had one complaint, it would be that the bike is too big, although this leaves a lot more room for details. All in all an almost flawless bike.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong>This is a great little set and for only $20! There are some flaws, but they are easily overlooked by the great detail and references. It is obvious that the Marvel line has been releasing this size sets with great minifigures ever since it started. This set is no different and provides some excellent minifgs and a really good overall model. This is definitely a must have for any Marvel fan just for Ghost Rider. I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a Marvel fan/collector and there are also some interesting parts and stickers for Lego cities. I hope you found this review useful and that it will help you with your decision.&nbsp;</p>

I bought it two years ago and it&#39;s one of my favorite sets because of the Ghost Rider and Hobgoblin minifigure&nbsp;. For it&#39;s price it has alot&nbsp;of pieces . 217 pieces to be exact . The corner is the most boring thing to build from the set . It isn&#39;t that special it&#39;s just decoration that you actually don&#39;t need for display . Also they put detail in the garbage can . Because you can put in a bone and stick or something else . <strong>Spider-Man is the same minifigure&nbsp;over and over again .&nbsp;</strong>Why not put in a different Spider-Man&nbsp;minifigure&nbsp;?&nbsp;Overall this set is great it comes with three minifigures&nbsp;lots of accesories&nbsp;. I give the set a 14/20&nbsp;and i defenitly&nbsp;recommend the set you will have fun with building the motorcycle and glider !&nbsp;</p>
