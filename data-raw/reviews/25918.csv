<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I find any and all lego set boxes to have good designs and they&#39;re nice to look at, so I liked this box. Especially this one. It has a nice mix of black, yellow, and blue, and it&rsquo;s got a big airy background of a road and a few buildings. It makes me wish LEGO included a build of it in this set. This set includes two instructions. One is for the Croc Chomper, Katana, Captain Boomerang and Batman. The other for the Bat Tank, Red Hood and his motor bike. Plus you get a little comic.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most of the parts in this set are black, yellow and gray. Which they should be for a batman set. It does include some new parts which I find very cool, the first of which is the Blue Boomerang pieces. They are a very useful and nice addition to this set, I really enjoyed it. The piece has a one single stud on the top and the bottom and the edge of it is a pole so the figures can grip it on both sides. some other of the new parts\ newly colored parts, are the teeth on Killer Croc&rsquo;s chomper. LEGO has had pieces this color before so it is not a new color. but they have not made the teeth piece in this color. I think it looks very nice and matches the chomper. It almost makes look like it&rsquo;s chewed up so much stuff they turned from white to yellow (He needs to brush it&rsquo;s teeth). And let&#39;s hope Batman wasn&rsquo;t one of the things it chewed.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>&nbsp;My favorite figure in this set is probably Red Hood. He looks so nice! with a mix of red, gray and the dark-tan color LEGO uses. The front side of the torso looks like his wearing a trench-coat but it does not go as far down as a trench-coat would. Under his coat it looks like his wearing armor like Batman only I think is the slitest bit cooler. Hint, hint, Batman. On the back of the torso it&rsquo;s just got some small creases and coat detail. Farther down on the torso there is another line across the back with very small vertical lines, to make it almost look like elastic. The head printing looks amazing, it&rsquo;s almost SpiderMany. with the red head piece and white eyes, just more mad. The legs are all black with no printing. I do think it would of been nice if LEGO would of included some printing, like knee pads or red boots or something. But I really like this minifigure and I&rsquo;m glad they chose this figure rather then someone else.</p>

<p>On to Captain Boomerang, I think this is addition to this set. But I he looks almost to normal. He&rsquo;s got good printing and all but he looks like a regular guy (Just a littler meaner looking). With no armor and only boomerangs he does not seem like a challenge for Batman. His head is one sided and and when he is wearing it the beanie makes him have a disappointed look. But I still enjoy this figure and I&rsquo;m glad he came with this set.</p>

<p>Next up is Katana, I am not a huge fan, so it was an ok figure. the one thing I do not like about this figure is that her face is gray. I do not understand why LEGO did that but the arm and torso printing aren&rsquo;t bad. I AM NOT SAYING IT IS A BAD FIGURE!. Part of her arm printing is from a different set, the Web Warriors Bridge Battle that come out around the same time this one came out. Her torso has cool hi-tech looking armor. This was not a bad figure, just not my favorite. Now we have Batman. This is just the typical Batman from the Beyond Gotham game. That maybe they&#39;ve done in to many sets.</p>

<p>But! Lastly! &nbsp;KILLER CROC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I just love this big fig IT IS AMAZING!! They chose the same green as the Hulk figure. But a new body mold with spines traveling down his back and head. And the face printing!! He just looks so evil!! and scary!!! AND AWESOME!!!!!!!!! and the contrast between the sand blue and the green! There&rsquo;s been a MAJOR modification sense the first one and this one! M.A.J.O.R!!!!!!!!!!!! I think LEGO did a very good job on him! Go LEGO!!!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start with the Croc Chomper. I really liked this build, some people did not. It was a fun build, and I like the chomping function on the build. It can be a little flimsy some times. And with Captain Boomerang&rsquo;s seat tower thing, I think it looks nice for him. Not for Croc.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/yo9u5faxf/Chomper.png"" /></p>

<p>Now the Bat Tank. I heard some people hated it, I how ever do not. It looks so armored and awesome! The function is ok, you twist a booster on the back and it flips half of it up forming a battering ram. The pieces fit nicely together. It was like watching a 3D picture unfold. I like how they used the angles to cover some things up and give it more detail.<br />

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p><br />
The completed models for both of the builds are very clever. There is not much more to the Croc Chomper. So on to the Bat Tank. I think it is the best part of the set. I think this set is very worth getting for it&rsquo;s price. I&rsquo;d say 5/5 stars for this set.</p>

"AETerry","2021-02-18T03:52:18.01Z","A So-So Set","<p>Call me old school, but the only real appeal for this set is that it&#39;s Batman and features a number of minifigures for Killer Croc (Maxifigure), Captain Boomerang, Katana and Red Hood in addition to another Batman minfigure.</p>

<p>Really, this is one of those sets where you pick it up mainly for the minifigures.<br />
<br />
The two vehicles have a standard complexity for build with the theme.<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t even know what to call that Bat Tank, it has treads and serves as yet another vehicle for Batman&#39;s growing fleet. It&#39;s on raised treads, suggesting it should be an all-terrain type.<br />
<br />
And the vehicle piloted by Killer Croc baffles me. It has an &quot;outpost&quot; hanging off of it for Captain Boomerang to attack from. The entire thing comes off as impractical.</p>

<p>And a third vehicle in the way of a red motorcycle for Red Hood, that&#39;s worth grabbing too.</p>

<p>Was it worth it for the figures yes. Toss the rest of the pieces into the parts bin for other builds.</p>
