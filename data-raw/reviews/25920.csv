"Chat_Li","2016-05-16T20:03:17.8Z","At last my first Clone Turbo Tank","<p>I am collecting SW Lego for several years. In the last years I have got AT-TE, AT-AP, AV-7 and other sets of the republic army. This set is a good addition for my collection.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>It is a big box. Not much to say. The rear side displays the functions of the model. nothing special at all. The new instruction book has good quality. Well done. By the Way, There are NO&nbsp;STICKERS in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are 80% grey. That is normal for a republic vehicle. AT-TE and AT-AP are also grey. So far so good.&nbsp;There are 3 control panel which are printed. They are new I think. No other printed part for the Tank.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Commander Gree is just like the one in the AT-AP. Same the Scout Clone Trooper. 2 Standard Battle Droid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two Jedi are both new. They are not in Clone Wars design. Good to not have a Other Anakin, Obi-Wan or Master Yoda here. I mean they are in so many sets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The chassis of the model is okay. Only suspension on the middle axis. I don&acute;t have a early version of the CTT, so I can compare it. Feel a bit cheap, but okay. The Size of the Tank is not really big. It is a little bit smaller then the AT-TE from 2 year ago. In fact the Turbo Tank should be 50m long and the AT-TE&nbsp;around 15m. So this is just a Clone Turbo Tank LT. You can put 3 minifigs in this model. The mini AT-RT takes the whole space in the Tank. Compare to the AT-RT of 501st. This is also an AT-RT LT. You got 6 missiles. 4 on the rack. 2 can be hide inside the tank. Other weapon can be put in to a box, which can be stored in the middle part of the tank. You got 2 thermo&nbsp;detonators, too.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When you are finished. The tank can start to attack the two battle droid with its whole fire power. The droids should not be worried, because i have already deployed MTT, Spider Droid and other reinforcement. The Battle of the Green Carpet can begin.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A good model no matter the size. Even it is a Turbo Tank LT. I think the Droids should have a STAP or other weapon. The CIS just looks to poor.&nbsp;</p>

"Echolord","2016-06-14T01:51:59.37Z","Send in the Big Guns","<p>The Battle of Kashyyyk was one of the last battles in the Clone Wars, fought between the Droid Armies of the Confederacy of Independent Systems, and the Grand Army of the Republic. The Republic troops served under the command of Jedi Generals Yoda, Luminara Unduli, and Quinlan Vos. Among the numerous vehicles used by the Republic in this battle was the Clone Turbo Tank, a massive, ten wheel monstrosity that crushed droid lines in battle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back in 2010, the LEGO group released their second iteration of this awesome tank, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8098-1/Clone-Turbo-Tank"">8098 Clone Turbo Tank</a>. That set was amazing, and sadly, I was not able to get it at the time. Now, in 2016, LEGO has once again released an amazing model, and this time, I was not going to let it slip through my fingers.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Turbo Tank is packaged in a large box, depicting the Tank in an action position, with the two Jedi included in the set running along side it. The tree cities of Kashyyyk can be seen in the background, which I think is a great detail. On the top, Master Luminara Unduli sports the actual size reference, with the other five minifigures included displayed at&nbsp;a slightly reduced scale. On the back, as typical with Star Wars sets of late, there is a section with &quot;blue prints&quot; of the set, and an advertisement for the Force Builder App.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instruction manual is a single, thick booklet. This comes in its own separate bag, protecting the pages.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The 903 pieces included in this set come in six numbered bags, and a separate bag with the ten wheels inside. I will note now that there are no stickers in this set, only printed elements where there is a design that called for unique print.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Luminara Unduli:</p>

<p>The last time this Jedi was released, back in 2010, she was fighting the separatists on Geonosis alongside Captain Rex. That minifigure was great, for the Clone Wars animated series. This minifigure though, is a much needed update. Her face is once again printed in the style of standard LEGO minifigures, in regards to the eyes. Her skin tone is the brick yellow color, as are her hands. This makes her skin look somewhat green next to the light nougat of standard minifigures. Her torso and legs are molded in black, and feature detailed printing, both front and back. The front of her torso has her belt, cloak clasp, and simple dress, while the back continues the belt, and also shows a hood. Her legs continue the belt, and show the long sash that the character wore in the movies. This is printed with some bronze and gold designing. Her headress is molded in dark brown for the first time ever, a decision that I greatly approve of. The cape piece included for the minifigure is a spongy cape, also in dark brown. While I do not like the lack of solidity these capes offer, I do appreciate the flexibility, and possibilities they represent. She has two expressions, one calm and serene, and the other angry. Both faces show her blue eyes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quinlan Vos.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I never expected the Grey Jedi Quinlan Vos to show up in a set again. And especially not in this form. The robes he is featured with are the ones he wears in the old comics he appeared in, not what he wore in the Phantom Menace, where he is clad entirely in dark brown, with sleeves. Just the same, this is the Classic Quinlan Vos design, and I love every bit of it. The torso is a new, updated print, with some better creases, and wear applied to the armor. The back printing has also been updated, and looks great. The legs are amazing, with the continuation of his sand yellow tunic, and a black stripe representing his pants beneath his tunic and boots. The legs also look great when attached to his 2011 torso. The head is great, with some stubble, and two large eyebrows printed on both faces. His yellow tattoos are also well done, with the large one fading into his stubble, accurately. The two above his eyes are questionable as to whether they are official or not, but either way, look great. One of his expressions is calmer, like Luminara&#39;s, and the other is angry, and ready for action. I think this face looks great on the character, given his history with the dark side. Finally, the use of the Thorin/Fili/Kili/Corsair hair piece is amazing. That wig is great for Vos, showing his dreadlocks quite well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remaining minifigures have all been released before, and I won&#39;t waste your time ranting about them. All four are great additions to the set, especially Commander Gree.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The Build is split up into six bags, starting with the AT-RT walker, and the main technic frame&nbsp;of the tank. Bag two adds more to the frame, and starts on the body. Bag 3 does more body work, leaving only the wheels and armor panels missing. Bag four is the wheels, all ten of them, nothing else. Bags 5 &amp; 6 are the armor plates. I loved the amount of technic elements used in this set, as expected, and I think It turned out great. I spent roughly an hour and a half on this build.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Wow. Just wow. The completed tank measures about 18 inches in length, and a good 6 in height. (With the lookout tower completely retracted) The tank is incredibly durable (I dropped it four feet onto my desk, and nothing fell off. That may have been sheer luck though.) The detailing is great, given that there are no stickers used. I love the fact that it is possible to fit every part of the set inside the Tank, even the battle droids. I have also found that it is very easy to modify the main section of the tank to provide a troop bay, which can fit 6 troopers. I think the maximum capacity I can do is 11 minifigs (with one on the lookout tower). The suspension/steering system works very well, with flawless turning and rolling. I rolled it across my bed, which had the sheets all bunched up for this purpose, and it stayed generall&nbsp;level, with some slight leaning as it moved, given that 8 of the ten wheels are fixed in place, I think this was pretty good.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love this set. It may have been a little pricey, but the detail level is great, and it looks awesome in my Kashyyyk display, alongside my AT-AP, Kashyyyk Troopers battle packs, Droid Gunship, and Tank droid. If you do not have a turbo tank already, get this one. And if you have a previous version, this one is still great, though definitely smaller than the 2010 variant. May the Force be with You</p>

"TK_1308","2016-12-19T14:47:31.443Z","""Sir, the droids are starting up their power generators.""","<p>Lego reissues the Kuat Drive Yards HAVw A6 Juggernaut, otherwise known as the Clone Turbo Tank, for the third time.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The standard large rectangular UCS black box. The Black Squadron Pilot is displayed on the top with side and front shots of the fighter. The front shows the TIE Fighter in the Death Star trench from the Battle Of Yavin, and also a smaller image of the ship on its stand. The back shows a close up of the ship on the stand and 7 panels illustrating the features.<br />
There is one thick A-4 instruction book.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The price per piece ratio is average for kits in this price bracket. While the majority are light and dark grey, there are some nice maroon, clear and dark sand coloured pieces included.<br />
There are 6 bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains the lower hull, the AT-RT Walker, the Elite Corps Clone Trooper and the 2 Battle Droids.<br />
Bag 2 contains parts for the aft main hull and some of the internal structure.<br />
Bag 3 contains the central cargo hull structure and the roof.<br />
Bag 4 contains the wheels, the extended axles and Quinlan Vos.<br />
Bag 5 contains the hull panels for the sides of the storage compartment, the aft cabin, aft central upper hull plating, sniper post, upper cannons, forward cabin roof and Commander Gree.<br />
Bag 6 contains the opening side panels for the main hull, the front and side panels for the cockpit and Luminara Unduli.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The set comes with six minifigures.<br />
Firstly we have two B1 Battle Droids. Both are armed with black blasters and while it gives the Republic troops something to shoot at, they&#39;re not really that exciting.<br />
Next we have an Elite Corps Clone Trooper. This is indentical to the previous release from the 2014 Kashyyk Troopers battle pack. He has the standard &#39;angry clone&#39; head and is armed with a black blaster.<br />
Moving on, we have Commander Gree. Again another reissue last seen in 2014&#39;s AT-AP Walker. Sadly he still comes with the &#39;angry clone&#39; head. He&#39;s armed with a black blaster and some grey electrobinoculars.<br />
Next we have Quinlan Vos. Last seen in 2011&#39;s Republic Frigate, he&#39;s undergone a couple of cosmetic changes. While the double sided head with smiling and fighting faces remains the same, he now sports nicer detailing on the torso and printed detailing for his legs. He&#39;s armed with his trusty green lightsaber.<br />
Finally we have Jedi Master Luminara Unduli. This is probably the best figure in the set. Her head has the calm and fighting faces and her headpiece is excellently done. The detailing on her torso and legs is superb, especially with the reflective gold and silver elements. She is equipped with a brown cloth cloak and her green lightsaber.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Total building time, 70 minutes.<br />
The build is very straightforward with no major problems with the construction. The mechanism for the suspension and vehicle turning is the same as 2010&#39;s Clone Wars version. There are a lot of hinging panels to allow access to the interior of the vehicle.<br />
The designed has taken some care to rectify the stability issues of the original version and the kit is very sturdy and solid once finished making it very driveable for kids and adults alike.<br />
There is a &#39;carry handle&#39; located at the back of the central hull but this tucks away neatly on the roof when not in use.<br />
There are 4 of the spring loaded missile launchers on the tank, two on the upper port and two on the upper starboard hull.<br />
The AT-RT is nicely put together and folds up so it can be stored in the central hull section. A nice tidy design and the dark olive green colour scheme is a good look. It has a ball jointed stud shooter on the front and seats one minifigure. The legs are triple jointed for poseability.&nbsp;<br />
Refreshingly, there are no stickers at all.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The AT-RT Walker is a nice little piece and while not as good as the 2010 release, it&#39;s still a great minifigure vehicle and would be a prime choice for future battle packs. The detailing in the build is excellent but it is let down by the stud shooter when the old style cannon assembly looks much better. That said, the ball joint allows for a lot of range with cannon firing.<br />
The AT-RT is 4.5 cm wide at the foot base, 6 cm long from cannon tip to antenna rack and 10 cm tall from foot to antenna tip.<br />
The Turbo Tank itself is a good, solid, playable vehicle but not without it&#39;s drawbacks. You can see what the designer has tried to do by rebuilding the 2005 version with elements from the 2010 release. I know I have made several comparisons to the Clone Wars issue of 2010, but that kit is just better than this version.<br />
The carry handle seems superfluous for a vehicle with wheels. It might have been better to make an attachment that would allow it to be carried by the LAAT-c from 2009. The central hull that stores the AT-RT is smaller and just has the one vehicle, over the 2 from the other release. Also, when you access the area to get the walker out, the whole side of the vehicle opens, exposing the cockpit interior as well which is not so good.&nbsp;<br />
The sniper post has always been a tricky design for a vehicle in this scale. It would make more sense to just build a small version of a turret than to try and get a minifigure in it. As such, it just looks a little silly on the top. That said, the new tooth and gear mechanism for raising and lowering the post is better than any issue beforehand.<br />
The Turbo Tank measures 14.5 cm wide at the wheel base, 33.5 cm long and stands 17 cm tall from wheel to sniper post.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a bad set but to be honest, it&#39;s not one of Lego&#39;s best efforts either. If you didn&#39;t get the 2005 or the Clone Wars 2010 version then this is a must have. If you have the previous issues then this one could be an easy miss in favour of other kits.<br />
Essentially remaking the 2005 release, this set does rectify some of the issues with the first version but still falls short of the quality of the 2010 one.<br />
The minifigure selection is not that great and by sacrificing the obligatory battle droids, you could&#39;ve had a squad of Elite Corps Troopers to man the vehicle instead.<br />
It has lots of playabilty for kids, is very &#39;driveable&#39; and sturdy and does look good on display or in dioramas but let&#39;s be honest, isn&#39;t it about time Lego made a UCS version of this vehicle and did the Turbo Tank justice?</p>
