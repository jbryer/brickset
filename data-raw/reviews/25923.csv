"Hanzo581","2017-07-14T03:19:07.977Z","It's not that bad....","<p>Got this on sale at Amazon for $35, this was crazy overpriced at $50 RRP, and probably even at $35 but I do not think it&#39;s as bad as a lot of reviews say. &nbsp;My biggest gripe is the cargo area, I can&#39;t understand why they didn&#39;t make it where the doors actually shut, instead they lower but little makes contact to the fuselage so when you pick it up by the belly it does squish a bit. &nbsp;The connection of the forward part of the ship to the cargo area could be better, but while feeling loose it does take some effort to detach, so it doesn&#39;t seem like it would come off while playing with it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>As long as you aren&#39;t looking at this as a sleek starfighter or transport and understand it&#39;s just an industrial scavenger I don&#39;t think it looks bad for what it is. &nbsp;On the playability scale I&#39;d say that&#39;s where it shines. &nbsp;You land, detach the cargo area, the cargo area opens and out comes your walker. &nbsp;My daughter took to it immediately making a pile of bricks and scooping.</p>

<p>Is this something you&#39;d build to display and look at for its beauty? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;Is this something you can have fun playing with? &nbsp;I sure think so. &nbsp;We watched the show so we may be biased but if you see this one for a good sale I don&#39;t think it is a bad buy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>75147 StarScavenger is not your typical LEGO Star Wars set.&nbsp; It isn&#39;t a sleek fighter, and it isn&#39;t a walker.&nbsp; It&#39;s (as the name implies) a junk scavenger.&nbsp; It has a scoop that can extend from the bottom of the cargo bay, or it can even deploy a small salvage walker (with the same scoop).&nbsp; The cargo bay section can open down the middle for easy access, and the cockpit also hinges open, with seating for multiple minifigures.</p>

<h2>Pros:</h2>

<p>This set is very good for playability</p>

<p>Quite sturdy, despite the skeletal back half</p>

<p>The forward section of the ship is very strong, and can detach from the rear half (and is reminiscent of set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75025-1/Jedi-Defender-class-Cruiser"">75025</a>).</p>

<p>Very few stickers for a set of this size, and these can even be left off if desired.</p>

<p>The rear half of the ship opens completely for easy access to the salvage walker.</p>

<p>Great minifigure selection.</p>

<p>Spring-loaded shooters (if you like them).</p>

<p>Guns mounted on the forward section have a full 360 degrees of swivel mobility.</p>

<p>Parts.&nbsp; This is where this set really shines.&nbsp; In addition to having a few large wing plates, this set has a large quantity of both dark blue and dark tan elements, in particular&nbsp;smaller ones.&nbsp; It also has a large quantity of transparent light blue 1x1 round tiles.&nbsp; All of these pieces are very useful for MOCing, and the minifigure components are similarly useful.</p>

<p>Decent price-per-piece</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Cons:</h2>

<p>The back half of the ship is entirely hollow, with large gaps on the rear and sides.&nbsp; It looks okay when the salvage walker is stowed inside, but when it is removed the entire rear section of the ship looks hollow and incomplete.</p>

<p>The salvage walker itself is very unstable on surfaces that are not perfectly flat, due to its tiny feet.&nbsp; It also has very limited movability in the legs.</p>

<p>Spring-loaded shooters (if you don&#39;t like them).</p>

<p>Seems overly expensive due to the fact that you essentially get 2/3 of a ship because of the hollow rear section</p>

<h2>Overall:</h2>

<p>Overall, 75147&nbsp;StarScavenger is a fairly decent set in terms of playability but has very little display potential.&nbsp; It looks rather unappealing from most angles due to the hollow and exposed rear half (particularly when the salvage walker is removed), but provides a large selection of parts in somewhat uncommon colors, particularly dark tan and dark blue.</p>
