<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The parts come in a silver bag attached to the front of the January comic with the instructions inside on the back of a poster.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not many parts, but mostly gray. A couple of 6 X 6 circular pieces are probably the best parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A simple build but for the size enjoyable.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>An ok representation of the Millennium Falcon, although the round dish does not match with the Episode 7 images on the packet.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this, but would have liked it more if all the parts were in it!&nbsp;Unlike normal sets you get no spares. With small 1 X 1 studs these are needed. I only had two of the four&nbsp;dark gray ones required to go on the top at the back. Overall it&#39;s good for a free set.</p>

<p>Bag attached to comic. Instructions are in the comic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Simple selection of grey parts</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple but fun for a small model</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Quite a good version for its size</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As I&nbsp;said in the title any version of the Falcon is good so I am pleased to add this to my collection. I don&#39;t think you could ask for more in a comic giveaway and at this&nbsp;size.</p>
