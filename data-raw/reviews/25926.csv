<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Typical City box with one instruction book. &nbsp;The instructions do have an accounting of the parts at the back.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing special though you do get two of the blue crystals along with one red boulder.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is where the set could have been awesome. &nbsp;4 figures is great for the price but they don&#39;t give you the coolest&nbsp;figure in the Volcano line - the dude suited up in silver with the logo on his chest. &nbsp;This figure only comes with the two most expensive sets (60124 &amp; 60125), so it would have been nice if you could get one here. &nbsp;Anyway, you get a female scientist, female explorer suited up, and two guys, one suited up.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Anyone who has ever built a City ATV will find nothing new here.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The little volcano is kind of sad and basically a waste of parts.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great way to fill out your Volcano layout with explorers&nbsp;and at a decent price. Shame they never had a set like this for Arctic!</p>

"BlueGalaxy47","2017-05-26T17:43:48.45Z","Cool City Set","<p>The Volcano ATV included in this set looks nice as I like the lime green colour. I absolutely love the printed Volcano logo piece on the front, and I like the detail of the front section as well. The back also looks pretty nice with lights, an antenna, and a clip. I especially like the inclusion of the chain to link the ATV to the lava boulder.</p>

<p>The build of the volcano is nice, using a good amount of pieces. On the other hand, I feel like space&nbsp;to the side of the volcano is wasted.</p>

<p>The volcano action feature is actually pretty good and will be extremely fun especially for kids to do.</p>

<p>The boulder&nbsp;looks special and mysterious, which is a nice look for what it was going for.</p>

<p>The minifigures and accessories&nbsp;included are really really nice and effective for this Lego scene.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a fun set which includes some very nice stuff.</p>

<p>The only thing they could do better with this set is to add more stuff to the side of the volcano.</p>
