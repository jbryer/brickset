<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Typical bright City box showing play features and minifigs.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some cool parts here, particularly the parts that make up the roll cage in the front and on the windshield. &nbsp;Also at least 16 1x1 clips allows you to customize the vehicle easily by moving things around. &nbsp;And I love the big chunky tires that come with this vehicle.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two standard Volcano explorer minifigs. &nbsp;Nothing special here but just right for the set. &nbsp;One suited up for exploration and one dressed to drive.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>While rather typical&nbsp;to other 6-wide City vehicles, it also has some interesting aspects that allow you to build the roll cage parts. &nbsp;I don&#39;t mind the stickers but the Volcano logo is a bit corny.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This is where the set shines. &nbsp;It is a rugged, realistic though futuristic looking 4X4 that appears dependable and tough. &nbsp;The drill piece swivels easily and looks cool in a number of non-working positions. &nbsp;You also can put a&nbsp;black bar piece (included as extra) on a clip on the side of the vehicle to let a figure ride standing on the runner and holding on. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Excellent vehicle that will be a steal on sale at $20 USD. &nbsp;&nbsp;I do wish City would have an overarching &quot;Explorers&quot; sub-theme that would encompass the arctic, deep sea, etc... so the sets and figures would all be a bit more compatible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rating of this set depends on what you expect, as in most cases. From the pictures I saw, I expected an average-sized truck or smaller, nothing too fancy. Well, all said: I was proven wrong!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing special. Standard box, one booklet, that&#39;s enough. Once again, the instructions are VEEERY detailed, so the booklet comes out quite long for a set this size...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Standard LEGO parts for a vehicle. Additionally, some TECHNIC parts for the drill arm. What I liked is the abundance of gear for the minifigures in such a small set! You get a jackhammer, a walkie-talkie, a ground detector-thing and a lava rock with a carrying device (?).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with two minifigures: a female scientist with a breathing apparatus and a male bearded driver for the ATV. The number of figures is good for a set this size, some older sets only have one minifig.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy, straightforward build, starting with the chassis and finishing with the drill arm and the tires. During the build you realize, this is going to be one really tough tracker!!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Even though it has nothing too special on it, it looks very cool! Personally, I like the green design, it&#39;s something different than just the normal white and grey and red from standard CITY-sets. The bulky tires support the overall strong and sturdy impression of the set. After the build was finished, it came out much bigger than I expected!!<br />
I also liked how you can switch between the drill and the hook to attach to the arm. The other part can be attached to the lower back of the truck, so everything stays together.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A nice set for a good price (I got it for 15&euro;). What makes it that good is the potential in playability! You can combine it nicely with other trucks and it fits really good into the whole Explorers-Subtheme (I call it that way). I can&#39;t find anything negative to say about it, maybe only the original price of 20&euro;, which is a little too high IMO. Would be a nice present for all lovers of LEGO trucks!</p>
