<p><strong>Build &amp; Model</strong></p>

<p>An interesting little build, putting the links together for the tracks was a tad tedious but the rest more than makes up for that. The Crawler&#39;s cab section is fairly typical for a City vehicle with it&#39;s removable roof plate but the little details and rear drill section make for a fun experience.</p>

<p>The quad bike and scenery piece are quite simple, but look okay for the parts used.</p>

<p><strong>Features</strong></p>

<p>The crawler has a rubber tyre underneath connected to the middle wheels, enabling the tracks to rotate on pretty much any surface. Rolling it around is smooth and satisfying. The rear drill tool can rotate 360 degrees and reach around quite well. It features an elastic band for some simple pneumatic action. It&#39;s designed to break open the new rock shape which features a hole in the top and splits vertically. You&#39;ll have to put it into the included scenery or attach it to some studs though or it tends to fly away!</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>The crawler looks good built, really good. It oozes presence and style without being too over the top while retaining the City playability we know and love.</p>

<p>Sadly the quad bike feels tacked on and unnecessary for this set. I feel the scenery part could have been a little larger instead, or perhaps the crawler could have some way of transporting the rock at the rear of the model.</p>

The price of this set is actually quite cheap for European countries (Norway, Denmark, Sweden). But for the set: it&#39;s actually a fantastic set. It fits perfectly in with the rest of the volcano line. For this set i will try to make it as detailed and complementary as possible!</p>

<h2>Minifigures:</h2>

<p>In the set we&#39;re getting three volcano-workers; two males, and one female. Two of them have bluish legs. The other man, has a volcano-suit with a helmet, and a pickaxe. I think the figures are great, nothing too special, but works fine with the set.</p>

<h2>The set:</h2>

<p>We get two vehicles; the main big crawler and an atv. The atv have a green front, and seat for one person. It also have a chain at the back to pull the orange volcano rock/stone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The crawler: th crawler have two big belts. The front is lime-green, with protection for the window. It also has four yellow lights at the top of the protection. The main&nbsp;<em>body</em>&nbsp;is light-bluish gray. &nbsp;At the back of the steering-cabin, there are two exhaust pipes. At the very back of the crawler, we have the yellow big pick-ax. You can rotate it, move it upwards, and use it to open the volcano rock.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>What i think could of been better:</h2>

<p>A known issue is that the belts can&#39;t move on a normal table or surface. You need to play with it at a carpet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also think that it looks a little bit unfinished some places!?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Total:&nbsp;6.5/10</p>

<p><em>Thanks for reading! Before disliking, please remember that our opinion could be different! Thx in advance.</em></p>

The only problem I had was the price. I could have expected more from this set like small mountain or something like that. Building it was pretty fun, but a little too easy. Overall pretty good.&nbsp;</p>
