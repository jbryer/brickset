The set consists of three parts, chopper (with a winch), a small caterpillar-vehicle (with a claw) and a drill-thingy. It came at a special discount-price of 40&euro; (normally 50&euro;), which I personally think is still quite a lot for a rather simple and&nbsp; only nearly medium sized set...</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The parts</strong></p>

<p>Not much to say here. Standard parts for a helicopter build. The lava-stones look nice, so do the blue crystals inside. I also liked the big claws of the caterpillar-vehicle!</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with three minifigs, which is good for the size of the pack. You get a helicopter pilot (standard pilot-face-guy...), a hardy driver for the claw-machine, who wears a breathing apparatus and a female scientist. I marveled at the helmet/hair combined part for her!! Back in my days, you had to decide: headgear OR hair! Nice!</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>Once again, not much to say. Pretty straightforward, starting with the drill, the caterpillar and then, in two parts, the helicopter. The most annoying thing was tying the string of the helicopter&#39;s crane to the winch! It took me nearly 10 minutes to tie seven consecutive knots onto each other to get a ball big enough to not slip through the hole in the winch! Quite frustrating...</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s... a helicopter! The most interesting thing about it is its color! ;-) It has a hatch in the back, which I personally prefer over the big plastic parts, most other helicopters have there. Inside the hatch is a toolbox to store the connector between the crane&#39;s hook and the lava stones. The winch of the crane wheels smoothly and the cord has quite some length. The helicopter also features a video camera on the outside.<br />
The small caterpillar-vehicle and the drill-station make a nice addition to the set. When you put a lava-stone under the drill and push down the drill-head, it fits into the small opening at the top of the stone and cracks it open. That&#39;s one nice little gadget!</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Since I am collecting LEGO helicopters, this one had to be added! I think I wouldn&#39;t have bought it, if I was not. For the price of 40-50&euro;, I would expect more than a rather small-medium helicopter and two tiny gadgets. It has good playability because of the nice functions of the different parts of the set. All in all, this set bears no surprises, just basic LEGO, which is nice, but not at this price!</p>
