"TioBella","2016-10-01T14:46:48.433Z","Lots of Fun, a Little Pricey","<p>I got this set for 10 cents a piece ($82)&nbsp;and at that price it is excellent.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Not that large of a box for a MSRP&nbsp;$120 set. &nbsp;4 books and book 4 has an accounting of the parts.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>If you can find this set for under $90 you will not only be getting a fun playset but also a good&nbsp;parts pack. &nbsp;12 BURP can fill out the terrain on any display. &nbsp;&nbsp;A bunch&nbsp;of small black connectors and specialty pieces are also included. &nbsp; See the build below for worst aspect of the parts.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Even with 6 minifigs the crew seems stretched thin once you build everything up. &nbsp;Also you only get one of the silver-clad&nbsp;explorers (and the only other way to get one is in 60125). &nbsp;However as noted above, you want to get this set on sale and then you can&nbsp;use $10 of the money you save to get 60120 to fill out your ranks. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The volcano is a simple build and the main base is fun to build and makes good use of 4187209 on top. &nbsp;The seismic display is one of the best uses ever for 4296152 which is tired of just being an antennae or control stick. &nbsp;The little UAV is a simple and fun build as well. &nbsp;The cockpit of the crawler is great using two different windshields and cage in front.</p>

<p>The problem with the build&nbsp;is with the treads on the crawler. &nbsp;They are made of roughly <strong>80&nbsp;</strong>small links that you must tediously link together one by one (part no. 6047885). &nbsp;This part does not work within the system and inspires no creativity or imagination. &nbsp;This aspect of the build was boring and the end-product is actually not that functional (the tracks roll with the help of two hidden wheels but not all that well). &nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Altogether a great playset&nbsp;that can serve as the foundation of a very fun layout. &nbsp;Somehow&nbsp;the rubber-band on the drill of the crawler makes it fun to poke at the lava rocks as well as the volcano itself. &nbsp;It is actually easy to fill out the inside of the base which is a little baron. &nbsp;Both side walls (which open) have a lip inside that is one stud wide. &nbsp;Whichever side you don&#39;t plan to open you can easily put a computer terminal or other small build (I used the terminal from 60077 and needed no modification).&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great set if you can get it at a discount. &nbsp;Sadly this seems to describe more and more City sets lately. &nbsp;</p>

"Sobel","2018-01-11T11:59:27.717Z","An OK set, high playability, but some major flaws","<p>This was the last set from the &quot;Volcano Explorers&quot;-subtheme, that evaded me so far. The regular price of nearly 100&euro; is FAR too much, to be straight! I got it at a special sale for 70&euro;, which is still enough, but OK.<br />
I gave this set 3 stars overall, because it has strength in playability and parts/minifigures, but (IMO) some major flaws in design, build and functionality.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Big box, robust, a lot of preview on the backside, as always.<br />
Also as always, four very detailed instruction booklets, so even the most incompetent builder understands how it works.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As with most trucks: big, chunky tires, baseplates, windows and stuff. A lot of gear, like a crowbar, camera and more. A lot of &quot;mountain-parts&quot; for the volcano, transparent-orange lava stones and parts and two moveable lift-arms/cranes. All in all a good variety of standard and special parts.<br />
BUT... those crawlers of the drill-caterpillar-thing... 84 teensy-tiny parts you have to clip into one another? This must have been the most tedious process I have ever encountered in my whole time as a LEGO fan...</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Six minifigures are included in this set, which is a good number. There are two female and four male explorers, so all SJWs get riled up. ;-P</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The small vehicles, the truck/trailer and the drill-caterpillar are an easy, straightforward build. Only exception: the crawlers of the driller, as mentioned before.<br />
The volcano must be built on an even surface, otherwise it will always break apart, when you apply pressure to put on one if the upper parts. That being said, the build took me around two hours, with no hurry, and aching fingers after the 84 crawler pieces...</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished set has an OK look to it. Nothing too special, except maybe the caterpillar.<br />
The drone and the small dumper are OK, nothing exciting, but they serve their purpose.<br />
The truck is bulky and massive, which is nice. It has a small crane on its back, to give it some additional use.<br />
The trailer is not that big, but high enough so that minifigures can stand inside of it. The inside of it disappointed me a lot. There is one single chair next to a seismometer with a cupboard above it and a crystal observation station. That&#39;s it. No more computers, no table, not even some clamps to hold gear! The camera and a pickaxe have to lie around on the floor. The opening mechanism of the two big hatches works fine, but it leaves an open spot in the roof of the trailer. Once again, couldn&#39;t this been fixed better?<br />
The drill-caterpillar looks cool, crawlers run smoothly. The drill itself does not work as good as the ones in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60122-1/Volcano-Crawler"">60122</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60125-1/Volcano-Heavy-Lift-Helicopter"">60125</a>, it tends to shift a little when pushed, what makes it a little more difficult to crack open the lava rocks.<br />
The volcano looks A LOT better than the one in 60125, but the eruption-mechanism was a disappointment. Only one lava rock fits in the &quot;crater&quot;, a second one has to go on top of it, sticking out above the volcano. In fact, when triggering the &quot;eruption&quot;, the lower rock tends to get stuck, because the &quot;crater&quot; has only the exact width of the rock. And again: such an expensive set, such a big volcano, was there no other way to put this into effect??</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As mentioned often before, I was a little disappointed. The set has a great playability, many minifigures with a lot of gear and some cool functions. So for kids who just want to play, it is good, solid four, if not even five stars.<br />
BUT, as an AFOL, I also like to consider other aspects. Like with a lot of modern LEGO sets, there are these parts and constructions that seem... unfinished, not thought through, unloving, something like that. For a set with a regular price of nearly a hundred Euros, I expect more. The 60125-set has a much more &quot;Base&quot;-like feeling to it!<br />
Nonetheless, it fits pretty well in the whole theme.<br />
That being said, this set is definitely no must-have, but if you have kids, it is sure to become a great source of fun, even for two or more!</p>
