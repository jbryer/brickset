<p>The box is nice and large. There is plenty of room for all of the parts and instructions with no crowding. All parts are bagged in numbered bags. The instructions are a thing of beauty. Two perfect bound booklets that were packed together with the sticker sheet. Each book has instructions for the two different builds that are possible with this set.</p>

<p>Very nice job, Lego!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts mix was very good,&nbsp;with a number of 1x2x4&nbsp;tiles and 2x2 slopes included in dark grey. Many of the parts are 2x4 slopes in white and red.</p>

<p>The included long brick and plates&nbsp;give the build a great&nbsp;stability, enhancing play without disaster.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minfigure&nbsp;selection is good with three males and one female. Two of the males are Employees of the station as indicated by a very nice, new torso piece in light blue with Octan&nbsp;logos. The other male is a worker in safety orange attire. Our lone female is apparently a customer in street clothes.</p>

<p>All are nice additions to the population of Lego City.</p>

<h3>The build&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The build was very straight forward, with no issues. I do wish that the main building was a little deeper than five studs. The Lego wall behind the checkout&nbsp;was a nice touch as was&nbsp;the dining area. I feel a 2x plate&nbsp;would have really&nbsp;improved the interior&nbsp;with&nbsp;&nbsp;a few extra studs in width, but that might have sacrificed stability. The gas pump and canopy are very realistic appearing when completed.</p>

<p>I like the look of the signage. I&nbsp;am NOT a sticker fan, but they&nbsp;help convey the whole &quot;feel&quot; of a real service station.</p>

<p>The vehicles were built by my four and six year old grandsons in &nbsp;a short amount of time... The street&nbsp;sweeper&nbsp;seemed to be the biggest challenge, taking the most time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honestly,&nbsp;the blue truck was never finished. Instead the&nbsp;oldest boy used the&nbsp;parts to build, in his words, a tow tractor! &nbsp;PERFECT,&nbsp;the reason we LEGO in the first place, imaginative&nbsp;play!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The set looks very nice when finished.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I&nbsp;cant wait to see the looks on my grandsons faces when they see the newest City addition! I&nbsp;am already planning to purchase a second set to build the alternate service area.</p>

<p>PS</p>

<p>They have already enjoyed an hour of nonstop play!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I highly recommend this set,&nbsp;although the price&nbsp;is well over the .10 per piece mark. The multitude of large tiles, door frames in light grey,&nbsp;three vehicles and four minifigs, make it worthy of the cost.</p>

<p>I really like the perfect bound instructions at this price point!</p>

"Scott1","2016-06-05T01:08:27.387Z","Wonderful Set, but Absolutely Nightmarish Price","<p>I really tried to justify the price on this set. I really did. But I just can&#39;t accept almost 18c a piece for&nbsp;a City set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Your standard City box and instructions, each with the new 2015 logo. I personally prefer the old 2005 one, but that&#39;s just me.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A great selection of parts, useful for building a great variety of&nbsp;vehicles if you buy the set for parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>You get four minifigs: a woman, two Octan gas station&nbsp;workers and a street sweeper driver. Pretty standard stuff, but they all look great.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Pretty standard too; it took me about an hour to build. There are a lot of stickers, however, so if you don&#39;t have steady hands those might become problematic for you.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Man, does this set look great when finished. I love this set. BUT... and it comes with a huge BUT...</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>When I saw the price at first, I thought it was a typo. I was expecting a $40-$50 dollar set. The price is ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE. I&#39;m sorry if&nbsp;I might sound harsh, but there is no excuse. There are no bigger pieces, no licensing, nothing. Just your standard set, but the price has been risen about $50. Luckily I bought mine at a discount, but even then I felt cheated. If you see it at full price, don&#39;t buy it. If you see it at 30% off, don&#39;t buy it. If you see it at 50-75% off&nbsp;(if that even happens) then you should consider it, but a toy should never have to be marked down 50% to even be remotely reasonable. Ever. &nbsp;</p>

"Harmonious_Building","2016-06-11T18:20:29.91Z","Make service stations great again?","<p>Even the most casual consumers of our favourite plastic brick is aware of certain tropes that have been running through official LEGO City sets pretty much from their inception: police stations, fire stations, airports, big trucks, and the occasional medical facility. Those who are slightly more in the know, on the other hand, are also aware that other lesser-known structures have a tendency to pop up from time-to-time: a harbour scene, a residential dwelling or two, and this: the service station.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last time Octan decided to provide a location for good citizens to fill up their vehicles was way back in 2007 with <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7993-1/Service-Station"">7993</a>, a set that has more than just passing similarities to our 2016 iteration and was famously still on a baseplate, a feature which is now all but extinct save for the annual Expert sets (by the way, as far as I&#39;m aware, 7993 was also infamously expensive on the second-hand market, though I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s still the case). The slow death of baseplates has been <a href=""http://brickset.com/article/19387"">famously debated</a> on numerous outlets, and I suspect that those who find themselves nostalgic about them can conceivably make a case here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a lot to love about this set, and I&#39;m not going to repeat what one can clearly see on the box. For those of us who have been collecting LEGO for some time, this service station really is a wonderful nostalgic throwback to 2007 or perhaps <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/1256-1/Shell-Service-Station"">even further</a>, before Octan&nbsp;pushed the evil Shell Corporation out of the way. It&#39;s essentially a modernisation of the aforementioned 2007 set, with an expanded retail area at the expense of the car wash. It is otherwise structurally identical and has a really good mix of &quot;basic&quot; bricks which are used to build up the structure as well as a lot of great tiles and curved pieces to give the station a more modern flavour, and it all works really well without being overly fussy. Stickers are a bugbear that plague nearly every modern City set nowadays, and while there are a number of stickers used here, I think that they are mostly used to very good effect, and in any case I&#39;m not one to complain about Octan stickers because I love having them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What I did not know about this set before buying it is that there is an official alternate build, and by &quot;official&quot; what I mean is that there is a full printed instruction book that tells you exactly how to put it together. This alternate build consists of a car wash and a repair garage, as well as slight alterations to the vehicles. I have personally not put this alternate build together, but it does add a really nice extra dimension of playability to the set for the younger crowd as well as help along their inspiration for MOCs of their own. As a side note, I reckon that this, too, is quite the throwback to back when retail boxes always showed alternate builds on the reverse, though this is one step further and provides instructions as well, much like the Creator line, I suppose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, this set cannot be discussed without mention of the price. US$90 for 500 pieces - why, LEGO? With reference to what I said about baseplates earlier, if there was ever a reason for a non-Expert set to bring them back, this is it. There&#39;s no way around it: the price is a serious turnoff here, and the only thing that mitigated it for me was the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/40221-1/Fountain"">free fountain deal</a> that was going on at the time, and even then, at 600 pieces and an extra Minifig, that&#39;s still a bitter pill to swallow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nonetheless, this is a great set with wide appeal: longtime collectors will be tickled by what it references, newcomers will definitely be able to enjoy a simple build that yields a beautiful result, and kids will certainly have a lot to do with the number of vehicles, Minifigs, and features involved. Balance this if you will against the rather exorbitant price - and this is by LEGO standards, mind you - and see if you think it&#39;s worth it. For my part, I can only assume that Lord Business has become the victim of a Middle Eastern oil embargo or something.&nbsp;</p>

"BrickyMcBrick","2016-12-28T01:07:39.047Z","A really nice edtion to anyone's city.","<p>Set number 60132-1 is, in my opinion, one of the best Lego city sets of the past two or three years. It has a very nice look to it and overall is a well designed set. Although it does not have much playability in terms of actual play features.</p>

<p>Box/instructions: The box is a appropriate size two hold all of the pieces and the two baseplates.Two instruction manuals are included, one for the main build and one for the alternative build, which is a mechanic&#39;s shop of sorts.</p>

<p>Minifigures: this set includes four minifigures, they are as follows: a tow truck driver with a blue Octan shirt and blue legs as well as a blue baseball cap, a woman with a rather nice green jacket over a red and white shirt with blue legs, a municipal worker with a orange jumpsuit/hoodie with plain orange legs and a attendant who features the same torso as the tow truck driver but with navy blue legs instead of light blue.</p>

<p>Building experience: Very easy with mostly just brick atop brick building, with a little bit of Studs-Not-On-Top at the base.</p>

<p>The final product: the actual service station looks to me like a gas station out of the 1950s-60s U.S. what with all the slopes and curves almost ever logo and design is a sticker (Arrgg) but non the less it looks splendid. It come with a total of three vehicles with includes: a small blue and white tow truck with large tires for getting over rough terrain, a yellow street sweeper with a very nice bristly brush for cleaning the streets and a burgundy car which could more then likely hold two minifigs at least.It also comes with a bike. The station has two pumps for gas and one pump on the side for air as well as a cash register and two shelves with drinks and even a small Lego set. The other room features a table and two chairs so that minifigs can &quot;eat&quot; a pizza. The sign looks very nice and realistic in terms of looking like a real world gas station sign.</p>

<p>Overall thoughts: Set number 60132-1 is a welcome addition to anyones Lego city although the only drawback may be the $89.99 price point but non the less this is a lovely set that is very well designed.</p>

"Kierloway","2016-09-24T10:33:40.66Z","Great set, now showing up at discounted prices","

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Very clear instructions and an alternate build to boot. In fact, once discounted further or on clearance, I can see myself picking up a second set and combing the alternative build with the main build next to my city square area. The box is attractive of course, but small for a $90 set.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t have a lot of white so I was happy to get those and many of the curved pieces as well. The vehicles are okay but nothing special. I do wish the street sweeper was a couple of inches longer and wider to justify the price.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Nothing special at all. In fact, I would say that for the $90 price tag, at least 5 or 6 mini-figures should have been included....not four standard figures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was very cool. I have only built the main one as it is part of my Lego city and what city doesn&#39;t need a gas station? I did enjoy the different aspects of building and I&#39;d say the gas pump was my favorite portion of the entire build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It just looks great aside from the tiny street sweeper. Of course I always wish these sets had complete walls, but I can fix that and that would just increase the price even more so no big deal and I can&#39;t dock them for that. It also means it can be played with.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you&#39;re building a city and don&#39;t have a gas station, this is a must have. &nbsp;It is now for sale at Walmart for about $67 so the price per part ratio is much better than before. Just go to any TRU, Target, or Walmart and they&#39;ll price match it for you. I wouldn&#39;t buy this for $90 though, just based on principle. I&#39;m very&nbsp;happy with it though, I must admit. On a fun note, if you own the city square set, you can use the pizza delivery person/bike for this pizza place if you&#39;re into photography or stop motion&nbsp;film work. Happy building!</p>
