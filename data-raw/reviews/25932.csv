<p>The box is way smaller then I was thinking it would be but considering it&#39;s mostly minifigures it makes sense. &nbsp;I liked the on box inventory of minifig parts and suggestions for swapping components to make different figures. &nbsp;I did not think this set needed three instruction booklets and steps. &nbsp;It could easily have been all in one. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts: &nbsp;</h3>

<p>There is not a lot of brick in this set but what little there is used interestingly. &nbsp;The specialty pieces like the soccer ball, baby bottle,&nbsp;and food pieces are great. &nbsp;This set includes the&nbsp;new hot dog bun piece.&nbsp;The wheel chair piece is unique and looks like it could be adapted for other builds fairly easily. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures:</h3>

<p>This is the heart of the set and they are amazing! &nbsp;You get 5 male, 5 female, 4 kids and one baby. Each has a different hair piece or hat and a different face. &nbsp;Two of the women and one of the kids have double printed heads for even more options. &nbsp;The one child figure is paired with a torso printed with Benny and the classic space logo on white with red sleeves, I would love to see this as an actual shirt available to buy from Lego in kids and adult sizes :) The details on the torso&#39;s are impressive. There isn&#39;t a boring one in the lot. &nbsp;The grandpa cardigan is the only one that doesn&#39;t include back printing.&nbsp;Some have been seen before but that doesn&#39;t take away from the set for me. &nbsp;Only one set of legs is printed, those are the painters and they are nicely done with paint splotches on the toe and waist to match the ones on the rest of the leg and torso. &nbsp;The baby was surprising. &nbsp;I thought it was going to be one piece and be just&nbsp;like the micro figures found with the&nbsp;games. &nbsp;It&#39;s not at all like those pieces. &nbsp;The head is actually it&#39;s own piece it has a small opening that only fits on the torso peg. The peg on top of the head is too small to connect with any standard bricks.&nbsp; The torso appears to have been&nbsp;done with the new two part molding techniques that allows the hands to be cast in one color and the body in another. The arms do not move but are at&nbsp;least included unlike the micro&nbsp;figures.&nbsp;The babies body does fit on a standard&nbsp;peg.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion: &nbsp;</h3>

<p>I loved this set. If you have a city you have to have this set. &nbsp;If you like story boarding you have to have this set. &nbsp;If you like minifigures you have to have this set. &nbsp;There are so many versatile characters to swap out and work with. &nbsp;You get a variety of ages,&nbsp;occupations, faces, and colors. &nbsp;I&#39;m really really happy with this one and I hope Lego releases more sets like this in the future!</p>

"Plural","2016-05-31T03:50:22.717Z","CITY's Magnum Opus","<p>When this set was first shown in the Toy Fair circuit, fans across the internet went crazy. Does the set deserve the love, though?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Fun in the Park- City People Pack uses the usual blue borders and city logo, nothing too special. The scene depicted in the box is the exact opposite. Life is booming in the park shown: Employees cleaning the grounds, kids playing soccer, a grandfather helping his grandchildren on the merry-go-round. It&#39;s teeming with energy, something that can catch a kids eye on a shelf, without overwhelming them with an abundance of stuff.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The top features the roster of minifigures in the set, which looks quite a bit bigger than I initially thought it was going to be.</p>

<p>On the back, the box art designers came up with an ingenious way of displaying the different events of the set; through pictures. Well, &quot;pictures&quot;, since the figs are standing in a non-existent world of non-bricks. I really like the effect, though, since the inclusion&nbsp;a step that really gives you the feeling that this is an experience. Also included is a little reminder that you can move around the different figs&#39; pieces.</p>

<p>The instructions are separated into three tiny booklets, all of which could&#39;ve been combined into one.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not exactly the most fluent when it comes to the different parts featured in LEGO&#39;s massive inventory, but you do get a few, emphasis on a few, interesting pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First off is probably my favorite; The hotdog bun. Although it first appeared&nbsp;in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-The-Angry-Birds-Movie""><em>The Angry Birds Movie</em></a> theme, the fact that the bun isn&#39;t going to become another forgotten book in the library of LEGO is a nice one. To accompany the bun are two hotdogs. They&#39;re just the usual piece, red and all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Secondly, I must mention the wheel chair. Exclusive to this set, it is quite the wonder. the piece that is used as the frame holds the minifigure compactly with the classic chair design acting as the backing. On the back is a pair handles. Their intended purpose? To allow another fig to have the ability to pull the chair around. It&#39;s a welcomed feature, adding more to an already grand piece.&nbsp;It uses new wheels too, almost like upscaled&nbsp;bicycle wheels with the pin inverted. This is, of course, one of the main reasons to pick up this set.</p>

<p>Speaking of bike wheels, let&#39;s talk about all of the smaller inclusions that I personally found fascinating. Of course, the set includes a bicycle. They&#39;re a pretty cool piece, especially when you have a hoard of cyclists running through your city. The City People set also includes a non-colored soccer ball (football for non-American FOLs) and a matching goal. Again, cool. The accessories of a few minifigs are pretty dweet, like the basket from the&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8831-16/Grandma-Visitor"">Grandma Visitor</a>&nbsp;CMF, the paint roller,&nbsp;and the baby bottle.&nbsp;Finally, there&#39;s the skateboard wheels; a total of five of them at all. None of&nbsp;these weren&#39;t used for the initial purpose of the part, which I personally find great.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Starting us off is the man who&#39;s prominently shown in the wheelchair. He&#39;s wearing a gray beanie, a piece I&#39;ve grown quite fond of. His face is the somewhat generic and extremely common open mouth smile that lays supreme in the CITY line, especially in pedestrian minifigs. The body piece depicts a hoodie over a dark red shirt, with the hood printed on the back. This is one of my personal favorite torsos out of the bunch, just for its practicality. His legs are in earth blue, which I&#39;m guessing are supposed to imitate jeans. He&#39;s a pretty cool minifig, all things considered.</p>

<p>Next up is the hotdog vendor. He uses&nbsp;the hat from the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8827-14/Butcher"">Series 6 Butcher</a>&nbsp;as his headdress, something that hits my fancy as I always loved the mold. His face displays an orange set of eyebrows and a nice handlebar mustache. His torso is chefish in appearance, with the little, red ascot&nbsp;and the white coat of a cook. Down below sits a pair of sand yellow pants, which don&#39;t look too jarring from the rest. Not going to lie, I love this guy. There&#39;s just something about him that just makes the vendor&nbsp;hilariously fun.</p>

<p>The businesswoman follows, Burnett bun included. On the top of he aforementioned hair piece sits a friends hair accessory pinhole, so you can add any bits you want. Her face shows a somewhat&nbsp;confident looking staring and a slightly opened, lipstick-applied mouth. Her torso and leg combo is a matching suit, dark blue in color. The blouse tries to get to the usual LEGO white, but is a shade too dark. Same with the slight yellow shown, but it&#39;s not too noticeable. She&#39;s an okay fig, definitely not the best in the line-up.</p>

<p>Following is the first out of four kids in the set. He uses the spiky hair piece in cool yellow, which is its first appearance. Following it is a childish face with some freckles on each sides and a slight, yet noticeably happy smile. He&#39;s one of the few minifigs&nbsp;who have a secondary face; a reverse of the previous emotion. The child wears a dark azure hoodie, unzipped to reveal a green-striped polo, and&nbsp;his short&nbsp;legs&nbsp;are sand yellow. The kid is a pretty nice minifig.</p>

<p>To accompany the previously mentioned bike, the cyclist rolls his way in. A white helmet lays on top&nbsp;of&nbsp;his grinning face, overly happy like most minifigs. The torso features an obviously spandex suit with bright yellowish green highlights and sleeves. His lower legs are completely black. He&#39;s alright, though not as great as the other minifigures.</p>

<p>The elderly man is quite an interesting minifigure. He uses the common and rather old hair piece in medium stone gray. His face print includes a pair of thick black glasses with slight bags under his eyes. The print also includes a gray mustache. The torso depicts a sweater, a little pattern shown on the middle. This sadly doesn&#39;t carry on to the back, which is kind of disappointing&nbsp;since it is a nice visual. The legs are just a simple pair of reddish brown slacks, but it fits the overall style of the minifigure. I don&#39;t know why, but he, and his following partner, are some of my favorite minifigures&nbsp;in the set.</p>

<p>The elderly woman is another one of my favorites. Using a pure white curled hair piece, it fits the more senior look of the minifig. The face print is a rather good one, with her&nbsp;golden&nbsp;wire-framed glasses with crow&#39;s feet on the sides of her eyes. She also shows a slight smile. She wears a light royal blue&nbsp;button-up sweater with a neat design on it. Unlike her other half, the design carries to the back. The legs are brick yellow and fits the character perfectly. As mentioned before, I think she is pretty great</p>

<p>Next is the painter woman. She has her medium nougat hair up in a ponytail, with a slightly tired looking face. She is one of the double-faced minifigures, the other face looking completely terrified. She wears some overalls in medium stone gray, a long sleeve white shirt underneath. The thing that makes these unique are the little blotches of paint applied throughout the outfit. It just adds that slight step of realism in the fig.</p>

<p>The next minifigure is probably the most anticipated child in the set. He has an average, non-detailed bright blue baseball cap. His face print follows the usual kid&nbsp;set up, freckles and all. The child also seems to be throwing a slight smirk. The shirt is the print most were waiting for, since it includes everyone&#39;s favorite named 1980&#39;s Space Guy Benny&#39;s head over the Classic Space red spaceship. This was printed onto a long sleeve shirt, white and bright red in color. His tiny legs are just a solid black. He&#39;s a definite selling point of the set and an obvious choice for the best child in the City&nbsp;People Pack.</p>

<p>His companion in the young boy&#39;s soccer endeavors is a little girl, with sand yellow, short, neck-length hair. She&#39;s wearing a pair of hot pink glasses, freckles accompanying it on either side. The shirt is a striped pink tank top accompanied by a cat on its left side. Below her lay short pants of the light royal blue color. She&#39;s a pretty cool minifig, but not &nbsp;my favorite in the world. I think it might be her somewhat jarring combination of the pinks and blue.</p>

<p>A Billy Mays lookalike magically appears in the set when we look at the Father minifigure. He uses the combed over hair piece in black, which perfectly lines up with his beard print. His eyes have little crow&#39;s feet forming on the sides, showing that this is not his first day in the park. He&#39;s wearing a bright red flannel, unbuttoned at the top by a single button. He has some generic bright blue legs, nothing special. He&#39;s a neat fig, but nothing to rave about.</p>

<p>Next is his daughter; a little girl with a cool yellow ponytail. She has single-sided freckled face, happy in appearance. She&#39;s wearing a purple T-shirt with a star in the middle, a light royal blue hoodie covering the rest. The legs are a shade of purple lighter than the shirt&#39;s, a medium lavender. She&#39;s pretty cool, the torso being the most reusable part of the fig.</p>

<p>The Mother figure is my personal least favorite out of the bunch. She has dark orange Black Widow hair, with a previously exclusive Juniors face. The first side depicts a slightly amused looking face, accompanied by some pretty thick lipstick. The opposing head shows her wearing sunglasses and a slightly opened mouth, now&nbsp;showing teeth. The torso is a flannel/tank&nbsp;top&nbsp;mixture of violets and purples, a small printed necklace being the most prominent outlier. The legs are light royal blue, no printing like most of the other leg pieces. As mentioned, I&#39;m not too big of a fan of her. She isn&#39;t bad per se, but just doesn&#39;t fit my fancy.</p>

<p>The last average&nbsp;minifig is the gardener. She uses the longer ponytail hair piece in dark brown. The head&nbsp;shows a rather generic female face, with a slight smile with lipstick around the lips acting as her expression. She&#39;s wearing overalls, similar to the previous painter minifigure.This specific pair is bright red and dark green, the flannel holding the former&#39;s color and the overalls themselves the latter. She&#39;s a pretty cool minifig and it&#39;s nice to see more variety when it comes to maintenance-based&nbsp;jobs.</p>

<p>Finally, we have the selling point of the set; the one, the only baby minifig! It is fantastic! Standing less than half the size of a regular minifigure, the baby is extremely tiny. This makes it really seem like an infant. Not only could it be held from the bottom through the brick-sized connection at the bottom, but it can also be held from the hand, since the baby is the average size of a handle. If nothing before this sold you, this tiny little piece will.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>There&#39;s nothing really to mention here, since the set is mostly figs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has some interesting moments, such as the construction of the baby stroller, but besides that, not much.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>The set, not counting the minifigs, has a few small parts. It&#39;s not an issue, since the figs were the selling point, not a complete and elaborate model.</p>

<p>With that said, there are a few things included. Since there&#39;s not much to really mention here, I&#39;m just going to list them and mention anything that makes it unique:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A Picnic Table</li>
	<li>A Merry-go-Round with a prettybright&nbsp;color scheme of bright yellow and light royal blue</li>
	<li>A fence segment</li>
	<li>A lawnmower</li>
	<li>A Hotdog Stand with a hotdog storage area</li>
	<li>A Soccer Goal</li>
	<li>A Stroller that holds the baby solidly but can&#39;t roll</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, simple builds that get their respective jobs done.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not going to be long with this. Buy. This. Set. It is darn near essential for any LEGO fan. Are you a collector? This set would look great on any shelf. A moccist? quite a few useable pieces and unique minifig elements. A storyteller? The story basically writes itself.</p>

<p>This set is fantastic for so many reasons, so please make a fantastic purchase and buy&nbsp;<em>Fun in the Park.</em></p>

"HarleyMeenen","2017-04-19T17:57:03.993Z","Amazing for Minifigs","<p>I wanted this set since I first learned of it, and I have no regrets about purchasing it, even if it is a little pricey for the piece count.</p>

<p>The overall scene is fantastic. There are tons of details put into the design, from a hot dog bun at the food cart to a bucket for the painter. And everything is highly versatile- there is infinite possibility for storytelling or even just different arrangements to shake things up and make a new display.</p>

<p>There are some features as well. The merry-go-round is very cool, and the soccer goal is a nice touch as well. The stroller is wonderfully thought out, and easily one of my favorite parts of the set. And, of course, there is the much-talked-about wheelchair, which is absolutely amazing. It is well-designed, perfectly functional, and a great element to have added.</p>

<p>The main feature of the set is the variety of minifigures. There are 10 &quot;adults,&quot; 4 &quot;kids,&quot; and a baby. Each one has unique clothes, accessories, and faces, with a few double-sided heads. Aside from the fact that there are already a bunch of amazing characters, the instructions specifically call attention to the fact that there are a huge number of possible combinations and encourage mixing-and-matching to create new ones. And I have to acknowledge the baby figure, which is a great little addition and absolutely adorable. I love this one and hope to keep seeing it in sets.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great, unique buy. It&#39;s a quick and easy build, but there is huge potential with this set for coming up with new ideas and really making it your own, which is a great feature we don&#39;t always see, especially to this degree.</p>

"SuperBrixBros","2017-10-05T00:04:02.71Z","Great People pack, a bit expensive, though","<p>Got this at Wal-Mart yesterday, and it turned out to be a great decision.</p>

<h2><strong>M</strong><strong>AIN </strong><strong>SET</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Wheelchair:</strong><b>&nbsp;</b>This appears in only one <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6154097"">other set</a>&nbsp;and institutes a new mold in light bluish-grey for the body and another for the wheels which&nbsp;appear&nbsp;in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6167307"">three other sets</a>. A pair of skateboard wheels are clipped onto the front to finish off the build.</p>

<p><strong>Hot Dog Cart:&nbsp;</strong>This build is simple, but manages to capture the look very well. I especially like the transparent middle refrigerator section and the hot dog bun which appeared for the second time in this set. Honestly, This hot dog cart wouldn&#39;t work in real life as the door for the refrigerator opens on top which would cause everything to fall off, but it doesn&#39;t really matter.</p>

<p><strong>Bus Stop:</strong>&nbsp;Not much to say, just a light bluish-grey <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6003098"">Standard With Foot 2X2X5</a>&nbsp;with a printed bus stop sign clipped onto it.</p>

<p><strong>Merry-go-round:&nbsp;</strong>Once again, simple design, but works well. The base is a large green round piece that is used as bilbo&#39;s door in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/79003-1/An-Unexpected-Gathering"">79003-1: An Unexpected Gathering</a>&nbsp;with added printing. A black turntable with a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6029690"">medium azure 6x6 round plate</a> and four yellow gates finish&nbsp;off this section of the set.</p>

<p><strong>Trees:&nbsp;</strong>Just two of&nbsp;your average everyday small pine trees</p>

<p><strong>Bike:&nbsp;</strong>Just your average everyday red bike with a yellow light on the front. Wish it came with a different colored bike though, as all my lego bikes are red.</p>

<p><strong>Flowers:&nbsp;</strong>Just pink flowers on a normal green stem, but I didn&#39;t have any pink flowers of this kind&nbsp;before, so that&#39;s cool.</p>

<p><strong>Park Bench:&nbsp;</strong>Nice dark blue color scheme and I like that the back is secured with click hinges instead clips and bars. This bench just looks great to me.</p>

<p><strong>Fence:&nbsp;</strong>White fence on a green&nbsp;2x4 plate</p>

<p><strong>Soccer Goal:&nbsp;</strong>This incorporates the 6x2 windshield frame piece very nicely</p>

<p><strong>Picnic Table:&nbsp;</strong>Some nice criss-crossing techniques used to create this table, don&#39;t like the light grey all that much, though.</p>

<p><strong>Lawn Mower:&nbsp;</strong>Looks great, but the wheels don&#39;t move, So works better for display than play</p>

<p><strong>Stroller/Perambulator:&nbsp;</strong>pretty cool, but the canopy is a bit small and awkward, prefer the one in Assembly square</p>

<p><strong>Dog:&nbsp;</strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/colour-Medium-Nougat"">Medium nougat</a>&nbsp;with black spots on the muzzle and sides. Looks like a german sheperd.</p>

<h2><strong>MINIFIGURES</strong>&nbsp;</h2>

<p>I&#39;m going to review these from worst to best (my opinion)&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>15) Lawn Worker:&nbsp;</strong>Green overalls, red shirt with blue criss-crossing stripes and silver clasps. She has a generic face, but thankfully it&#39;s not <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4651443/mini-head-no-893"">this one</a>. Her hair is a long dark brown ponytail that is pretty common.</p>

<p><strong>14) Hot Dog Chef: </strong>Dark tan pants, a normal chef shirt, a face with an orange mustache and a peaked hat. He would be higher on the list if I hadn&#39;t gotten the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71018-6/Hot-Dog-Man"">Hot Dog Man from Series 17</a>&nbsp;(not to be confused with the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71008-14/Hot-Dog-Man"">Hot Dog Man from Series 13</a>) Anyway, that minifigure&nbsp;makes this hot dog chef look boring.</p>

<p><strong>13) Dad:&nbsp;</strong>Blue legs, red plaid shirt, face with black beard, and nicely parted hair. He comes with a normal Lego croissant.</p>

<p><b>12) Mom:&nbsp;</b>Medium blue legs, medium lavender jacket with pink shirt and necklace printed on it.&nbsp;Smiling face on the front, pink sunglasses on the back,&nbsp;and <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sh186"">Black Widow&#39;s</a> hair. She also has a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/colour-Flame-Yellowish-Orange"">flame yellowish-orange</a> basket and a red apple, which is nice, because a lot of my Lego&nbsp;apples are green</p>

<p><strong>11) Grandpa:&nbsp;</strong>Brown pants, a believable grandpa sweater with the diamond thingies on the front, a face with big, square glasses and a huge mustache, and gray hair. The funny thing about this figure is that his almost exact replica is in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60154-1/Bus-Station"">another set</a>, except the legs which are dark red in the other set.</p>

<p><strong>10) Blue Hoodie Kid:&nbsp;</strong>My least favorite child in the set, but by no means a bad figure. Dark tan small legs, a&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/colour-Dark-Azur"">dark azure</a>&nbsp;hoodie with a lime green striped shirt, an excellent freckled face&nbsp;design with two sides, and to top it all off, a light yellow spiked up hair piece.</p>

<p><strong>9) Biker:&nbsp;</strong>Normal black legs, but his torso is really what completes the figure. Black with lime green arms, shoulders and pockets, a silver zipper at the top and some crease lines at the bottom give it a realistic coat look. His smiling face and white bike helmet finish off the minifigure. Especially the helmet&nbsp;because I&nbsp;have&nbsp;like, 7 bike helmets.&nbsp;One is red, and the other ones are all lime green from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71001-6/Skydiver"">Skydiver</a> from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71001-17/LEGO-Collectable-Minifigures-Series-10-Complete-(except-Mr-Gold)"">Series 10</a>&nbsp;who I got&nbsp;<em>six times.&nbsp;</em>(not on purpose, either)</p>

<p><strong>8) Grandma:&nbsp;</strong>Tan legs, <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/colour-Light-Royal-Blue"">light royal blue</a> sweater with light&nbsp;and dark blue printed patterns to create a realistic grandma-ish&nbsp;sweater, she probably knitted it herself. She has a face design that is very reminiscent of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71002-14/Grandma"">Grandma from series 11</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71004-6/Mrs-Scratchen-Post"">Mrs. Scratchen&nbsp;Post</a> from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71004-17/LEGO-Minifigures-The-LEGO-Movie-Series-Complete"">The Lego Movie Collectable Minifigures Series</a>. Her hair is also very similar to the aforesaid grandma, but in white, which is neat because the only white minifigure hair&nbsp;I had before was from <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sh180/quicksilver"">Quicksilver</a>, and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71019-21/LEGO-Minifigures-The-LEGO-NINJAGO-Movie-Series-Complete"">TLNM&nbsp;CMF</a> <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71019-10/Zane"">Zane</a>.</p>

<p><strong>7) Businesswoman:&nbsp;</strong>Dark blue legs, a torso printed with a snappy dark blue suit with a white shirt underneath and two gold buttons. Her face is almost identical to the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71002-11/Scientist"">Scientist in Series 11</a>&nbsp;and her business-like hair is included in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6146924"">two sets</a>, this being the first. She also has a brown briefcase, I used to have another one until it broke in two</p>

<p><strong>6) Painter:&nbsp;</strong>These are the only printed legs in the set. They&#39;re grey with one white paint splotch, one pink paint splotch, one light blue paint splotch, and three green paint splotches. Her torso completes the overalls look and has one white paint splotch, one green paint splotch, two pink paint drips, two blue paint drips, and two more blue paint drips on her white shirt. Her face has a dreamy look on one side and a scared expression on the other side. Her hair is a medium nougat ponytail and she has a grey bucket with a dark tan handle, and a black paint roller with a white 1x1 round brick for the actual paint.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>5) Gold Star Shirt Girl:&nbsp;</strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/colour-Medium-Lavender"">Medium lavender</a>&nbsp;short legs, which first appeared on <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sh060/the-penguin"">Penguin</a> from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-DC-Comics-Super-Heroes/subtheme-Batman"">Batman line</a> from 2013, a light royal blue jacket over a purple shirt with a gold star displayed prominently in the center, and a freckled face which calls to mind that of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8831-16/Grandma-Visitor"">&quot;Grandma Visitor&quot;</a> from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8831-17/LEGO-Minifigures-Series-7-Complete"">Series 7.</a>&nbsp;Her light yellow hair suggests that she is <strong>Blue Hoodie Kid&#39;s</strong> sister.</p>

<p><strong>4) Cat Shirt Girl: </strong>This child has Dark Azure Small legs (this set institutes a plethera of unique colors for minifig parts), a pink striped shirt with a cat face in the corner, a face that&#39;s basically just the <strong>Gold Star Shirt Girl&#39;s</strong> face with glasses slapped on top, and dark tan short straight hair, which has only appeared in this set.</p>

<p><strong>3) Space Shirt Kid:&nbsp;</strong>I already had two pairs of dark blue children&#39;s legs from&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sh384"">Rocket Raccoon</a> and an <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw710/ugnaught-(75137)"">Ugnaught</a> and as neither of&nbsp;those two have a&nbsp;desire to lose their legs, these new ones are a welcome addition. This child&#39;s torso is brilliant! With the spaceman logo in the center and the red trim around the top, it&#39;s one of my favorites from the whole set. His facial design is equally good, a sly smirk with one eyebrow raised and a smattering of freckles make this child look like he&#39;s up to no good. I wish he came with the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-11303"">new style of hat</a>, though, as I already have plenty of these.</p>

<p><strong>2) Teenager:</strong>&nbsp;This parkgoer&nbsp;has dark blue jeans, a dark red shirt covered by a light gray jacket, a generic smiling face, and a dark gray beanie. The jacket is quite unique, having only appeared in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6153512"">five&nbsp;sets</a>, and the beanie is absolutely perfect with its&nbsp;detailed wrinkles, it kinda looks like a smiley face on the back :)</p>

<p><strong>1) Baby:&nbsp;</strong>This was Lego&#39;s first&nbsp;baby minifigure&nbsp;that wasn&#39;t <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/tag-Maggie-Simpson"">ridiculously oversized</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71011-5/Tribal-Woman"">wrapped up so you can&#39;t hardly see it</a>, or <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/5233-2/Bedroom"">just a normal minifigure.</a>&nbsp;I remember seeing the preliminary images with the baby&nbsp;and thinking,&nbsp;<em>I&#39;ve gotta get my hands on that set.&nbsp;</em>Well, now I do! The baby&#39;s body is small and white with no movability whatsoever and dual-moulded with yellow hands. The head that came in my set was different than all the pictures except <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6204394/mini-figur-baby-head-no-1"">this one</a>. mine has a head shape closer to that of a minifigure&nbsp;with a neck and an open stud on top, while <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/cty668/baby-white-body-with-yellow-hands"">this picture</a> shows no neck and a closed stud on top. I have two other babies that I bricklinked, and they have normal heads. And they all say lego&nbsp;on the inside of the head, proving that they&#39;re all genuine pieces. Anyway I have no idea what&#39;s going on, because as far as I know, Lego didn&#39;t make two different baby heads.</p>

<h2><strong>FINAL VERDICT</strong></h2>

<p>Excellent set! the minifigure&nbsp;selection is great, comes with some unique parts like the baby and the wheelchair (custom professor x&nbsp;options just rose to whole new level) The price is a bit high, but it&#39;s worth it. Overall, it&#39;s a great set all around!</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s all! Thanks!</p>
