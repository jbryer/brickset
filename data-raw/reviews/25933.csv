Being fans of the story, both my daughter&nbsp;(4 years old) and I were thrilled to build and play with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simple build with many large pieces. Younger children will need help with building the characters as there are plenty of 1x1 pieces like flowers and even the build-up characters.&nbsp;Characters like Beauty and the Beast are expected to be the highlight but i think Cogsworth and Wardrobe&nbsp;are both very cute. The swivel action of their faces makes my daughter laugh every time she plays them. Good inclusion also is that the Beast can become the Prince with an easy swap. Also, the &quot;stained glass window&quot; showing the final scene in the Disney cartoon is very nicely represented with a transparent sticker over a transparent piece. A very very nice inclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After build, the castle is smaller than expected from the box/packaging. For the RRP of AUD$75, i would expect more scenes like a library or the snow-laden garden with birds or even the ballroom with dining table to seat Beauty and the Beast on either end will be lovely. Still, my daughter enjoy playing with it very much and even my 21 months old daughter (not recommended for under 3) love playing with the figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, fun and has most memorable scenes with iconic Enchanted Rose, mirror showing Belle&#39;s father - Maurice, Belle&#39;s book, many many characters and swelving&nbsp;dance table &amp; turn table. A must have for any Beauty and the Beast fan.&nbsp;</p>
