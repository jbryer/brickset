<p>the whack a frog part is&nbsp;great.</p>

<p>the targets are great to hit with the new water stud shooter gun, and the basketball game is fun to have with that technic style launcher lever,</p>

<p>i also love mia&#39;s new tank top with the water melon design,</p>

<p>this is the second mia set i,ve bought my daughter this month&nbsp;and the new outfits on the &nbsp;adventure camp and&nbsp;theme park&nbsp;minidolls are fantastic, creative and colourful,</p>

<p>The build is pretty simple and can get repetitive with things like assembling the targets, but it&#39;s quick and there&#39;s enough variety between the three games to keep it sufficiently interesting. There is only one mini-doll, which is reasonable for such a small set.</p>

<p>The real feature here is the playability of the set. Its nice that it looks good, but its even better that it plays well. Each of the games is fully functioning. The frog game is the least interesting, as you just press a lever to make the frog appear and disappear and hit it with a mallet when it is raised- this could be more of a challenge with two people. The other two games can be played solo and feature more of a challenge. The shooting gallery in the middle allows you to aim for the targets and knock them over using launched studs. Finally, there is the basketball game, which is pretty self-explanatory. The games offer a nice challenge and were surprisingly fun.</p>

<p>For such a small, simple set, this one packs a good punch. I was hesitant about this one, but was quickly blown away.</p>
