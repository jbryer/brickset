"HarleyMeenen","2017-04-22T02:25:29.267Z","Great Durability","<p>There is admittedly not much to this set, as it&#39;s one of the smaller ones in the line. There is an ice cream cart, which adds a simple but nice touch. Next is a photo booth with an attached camera. I haven&#39;t yet put the stickers on, and I suspect it would look much better with them. Overall, though, there&#39;s really not much to say about the side builds.</p>

<p>The main feature is, of course, the space ride itself. The build is quick and a bit repetitive, especially with building the rocket cars, but they&#39;re easy and fast enough that I didn&#39;t really mind.</p>

<p>I was worried that the ride would not really work, but was definitely wrong. My first instinct to test my fear was to violently spin the ride with a mini-doll seated in it. And it worked brilliantly. The figure stayed perfectly in place rather than flying out as I expected. The arms work as intended, with the ships lifting at higher angles as the speed increased.</p>

<p>This set is a perfect depiction of a classic ride, and I couldn&#39;t be happier with it.</p>

Classic Space fans might not appreciate the colours, but the logo is used quite effectively for this type of ride.</span></span></span></span></p>

The big difference from past boxes is the use of some nice amusement park themed lighting and trim at the top of the box including the look of the Friends characters to match their available costumes in this sub-theme. This is a really fun box design, much more than past Friends boxes.</span></span></span></span></p>

There&rsquo;s also a checklist for the LEGO Elves sets released at the same time on the inside back cover.</span></span></span></span></p>

I advise caution as this could spread to sticker sheets with creases or tears in them due to the nature of the loose sheet.</span></span></span></span></p>

Overall a great new part with a ton of uses.</span></span></span></span></p>

Her top features magenta and white stripes and she looks quite nice, I will admit though I do wish that the characters might get different hair pieces sometimes for unique appearances. She pretty much looks the same here like any other Olivia Mini-Doll. No unique-to-her accessories either, not even a pair of sunglasses to affix to the top of her hair, unfortunately.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 1: Olivia gets to experience the fun of helping you build the ice-cream stand, the photo stand and the central portion of the main ride. This build will include sticker placement, the only tricky portion of the build in my opinion is lining up the stickers just right to adhere properly to the parts. It was a very satisfying and enjoyable build for this set, the little ice cream freezer thing was fun to build too and helps to add another level of playability.</span></span></span></span></p>

Each one is built the exact same way, and once again there is a lot of sticker placement here which can be tricky, but it&rsquo;s a fast build once you get to understand the steps and also quite fun to finish off the ride and watch it all come together.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Space Ride: This thing is loaded with charm and enjoyable nods to LEGO&rsquo;s Classic Space era, in fact all of the markings on the rockets themselves are stickers with the Classic Space logo on it. This model would even look good in a LEGO City Amusement Park, despite some of the traditional LEGO Friends colours Amusement Parks are known for their colorful appearances after all.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The play feature to spin the ride is very simple and very well executed. The sticker detailing on the ride itself are slightly reflective and show stars and other space elements. The new connection piece is a godsend here as it allows the three rockets to spin and ride up and down.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Ice Cream Stand &amp; Commemorative Photo Booth: These additional models include more play value, there is a large commemorative photo booth with a camera attached to the top and angled to face the ride to catch the riders as they spin around in a circle. The model is fairly simply build and looks like what you&rsquo;d find at an amusement park.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Ice Cream &lsquo;Stand&rsquo; is more of a simple push cart freezer, not an actual stand, I&rsquo;m guilty a bit of fudging the name a little to make it simpler. It&rsquo;s a simple little build too and uses some parts to great effect. Pop open the door and you can claim a Popsicle or a scoop of chocolate ice cream. Two cones are attached to the outside, one of them already adorned with strawberry flavored ice cream.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">These two little models offer more to do with the set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

The introduction of a new piece helps enhance the playability of this set, and that playability is very fun. You can spin the space ride around and around or let go and watch it spin after twisting it.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The current price at Costco of 13$ is a great value for this set, I find myself tempted to get a few more for the parts alone. Perhaps if time allows. I very strongly recommend picking this set up if you haven&rsquo;t done so already, it is a great little set and this entire Sub-Theme is brilliant. LEGO Friends continues not to disappoint.</span></span></span></span></p>
