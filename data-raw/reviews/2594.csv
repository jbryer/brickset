You get a minifig and a good number of bricks in red, yellow, and blue, as well as some windows, wheels, and a door. Plus, you get a 16 x 16 baseplate. I have very fond memories of trying to build the alternate models to this set, which have the edges of bricks drawn in black - very helpful to a preschooler! I wish sets like this were just kept in circulation.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>This was my first set that introduced me to the LEGO world. It was very basic but it helped a lot to get my imagination flowing.</p>

<p>I remember to have built the different shapes and figures that the instructions suggested and then my parents saw that this was the best way to keep me busy and stop bothering them so they kept buying me more.</p>

<p>I&#39;m 30 now and still keep all of my LEGO stored in a big plastic box for whenever I have a kid.</p>
