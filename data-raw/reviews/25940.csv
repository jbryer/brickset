And while I do love the look of the set, that is, unfortunately, about all there is to love.</p>

<p>For me, the main appeal is that the set does come together nicely with some clever building techniques to make the unique hot dog shape. The end result really is quite nice looking, and the set includes some well thought out details, such as condiment bottles and a grill inside. It also includes two of the new hot dog bun pieces which seem to be fairly popular.</p>

<p>Beyond that, though, there isn&#39;t much to it. Most of the build is simple and not particularly interesting. The van can drive around, but it&#39;s a bit unwieldy. The side builds are quick and don&#39;t add much to the set.</p>

<p>Overall, this one is a nice visual detail or background piece. Personally, I didn&#39;t initially intend to buy it, and I probably would have been just as well off skipping it.</p>

<p>The actual building experience was simple and fun.</p>

<p>The photo booth really highlights the carnival feel of the Amusement Park theme. Someone wearing a product-related costume is a more common promotional device. However, this set and especially the photo setup had an overabundance of small models to go with the main build.</p>

<p>As usual for Friends, the smooth furniture isn&#39;t actually useful to seat minidolls, so I either don&#39;t build it or replace tiles with 1x2x1 panel with center divider (part 93905). The long plate for a roof is a bit flimsy, so I braced it with a plate underneath. A 2x6 isn&#39;t enough. A 6x10, which fills the whole space, is too tight. A 6x8 fits great.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a better food cart than 60150 Pizza Van and is a good complement to the Friends pizzerias 41092 and 41311.</p>

<p>The price was a bit much for the piececount, but the set was often on sale.</p>

<p>Perfect building experience, parts, and playability. However the price is not perfect and is just ok, due to the use of larger pieces. Should have been $25 though.</p>
