I was a little intimidated by its size, but once built it was considerably smaller than I feared it to be. If you have limited space at home, that&#39;s important.</p>

<p>The set contains a complete funfair, including a roller coaster, ferris wheel, and spinner. The build is pretty straightforward with some trickier steps with Technic elements. We have four minifigures and many minibuilds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As usual with Friends, there&#39;s a lot of thoughtful attention to detail. For instance, there are cameras attached to the rides&nbsp;so that the minifigures can purchase pictures of themselves screaming. Another nice thing is the battery-powered lamp in the train&#39;s first car. For me the ferris wheel stands out as the most interesting and educational part. You can learn a lot about physics by playing with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Usually with the Friends range, a lot of elements aren&#39;t attached to anything and consequently get sucked up by the vacuum cleaner. While there are such elements in this set, they are fewer than normal and that&#39;s a very good thing.</p>

<p>This set is clearly&nbsp;nice as a display piece, but the crucial thing here is of course its playability. Well, the set <em>partially</em> delivers. It is generally fun to play with and my daughter likes it. What&#39;s problematic is stability and how the minifigures attach (or rather&nbsp;don&#39;t attach) to the rides. They fall out a little too easily&nbsp;and that should have been addressed. The ferris wheel should have had standard feet attachment&nbsp;bricks&nbsp;(like the spinner has)&nbsp;so that the minifigures aren&#39;t jettisoned. I don&#39;t understand why the designers&nbsp;did it this way.</p>

<p>The roller&nbsp;coaster is fun with some cool action features but the center of gravity sits too high when the minifig is seated. And when empty, the car is too light, all resulting in frequent frustrating derailments. So the minifigures will definitely need life insurance before embarking on these rides.&nbsp;I also&nbsp;feel more than just four minifigures is&nbsp;justified for a set like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, I think this is a nice set which feels similar in quality to other sets in the Friends range. I think I got good value for my money, given that I purchased this on a sale. Otherwise, I think you can do better with your money.</p>

<p>There are three main builds along with several smaller side builds and a total of four mini-dolls. It would have been nice if another figure or two was included to fill up the area a little more, as it is a little sparse with three times more ride seats than people.</p>

<p>The side builds offer some nice little additions and character. There&#39;s a popcorn cart, rounding out the park&#39;s food offerings offered in other sets, and a small dining area in which to enjoy it all. There&#39;s also the turnstile at the entrance and an information stand, which adds to the feeling of a complete park.</p>

<p>The first of the major builds is the roller coaster, which was actually probably my least favorite of the three rides. It&#39;s a simple oval track with a hill up and a hill down. There are several features along the way which the cars interact with, which admittedly is not very realistic, but adds some interest. It would, of course, be nice if the cars were powered rather than having to be pushed along, but even so it looks nice and provides some fun features.</p>

<p>The second ride is the drop tower. You can push the car to the top and it spirals down. It also includes a camera to snap a photo of the riders. It&#39;s a pretty simple build with a really cool end result. There&#39;s nice attention to detail with things like the restraint bars. There are some minor issues- if you take the car all the way to the top, it gets stuck and needs to be nudged back down (though this actually works well to create a moment of suspense by holding the car at the top before dropping it.) As with the other rides, I was afraid of having the figures fall out, but they stayed secure through the whole drop.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the Ferris Wheel. This is a quite repetitive build, as there are two sides with lots of studs, and there are six cars which are all one of two very similar builds. It&#39;s a little harder to fit the figures into the cars, but they do fit. And while it was a bit frustrating to build, the wheel looks great and functions well.</p>

<p>Overall, I love this set. It offers a nice time commitment and excellent value. Kids can definitely get hours of play from the rides, and it makes a good display for older builders.&nbsp;</p>
