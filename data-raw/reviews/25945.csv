"xboxtravis7992","2016-03-28T18:38:21.443Z","Great Impulse Buy!","<p>So this morning my dorm room bathroom ran out of soap, and I left to buy some&nbsp;more at the store. Luck was on my side, as I noticed while browsing the Lego section that this polybag&nbsp;was on display for sell. I snatched it up along with &quot;Olaf&#39;s Summertime Fun&quot; which was also on display. This polybag has been a great little set to piece together. I was excited to build the polybag, since its set designer Justin Ramsden was recently interviewed by Brickset.</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>I don&#39;t normally care for packaging, and this is just a simple polybag. The instructions are on one piece of paper, which was details on both sides.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>There are a lot of parts here that will excite a Lego builder. There are FIVE minifigure heads decorated with a print to represent Venom&#39;s mouth. There are a few &quot;Mixel joints&quot; in the arms, and there is also one example of this 1x2 plate with teeth:&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>The minifigure&nbsp;included in the set is the plain and simple Spider-Man that has been produced since 2012, with a Super-Jumper as his only accessory. I know fans have mixed feelings about this version of Lego Spidey, and I still profess that my favorite Lego Spider-Man is the highly detailed version made for the&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2 </em>sets&nbsp;a decade ago. However I am glad to finally have this &quot;basic&quot; Spider-Man, especially since it appears his MCU appearance in <em>Captain America 3</em> will look a lot like the cartoon versions of the character. My only complaint is I wish he had come with a rope for webslinging instead of a Super-Jumper.</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>I don&#39;t own any Mixel sets, but I felt building the Venom Symbiote that I was building a &quot;Marvel Mixel.&quot; The build is centered on building a frame, and then attaching limbs and appendages to it. It is basic, but surprisingly satisfying for a $5 set.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>The finished Symbiote&nbsp;is about the size of my palm. It has a lot of limbs and legs that can be adjusted, and when the legs are placed so the figure is as tall as it can go, it is about 2 1/2 times taller than a standard minifigure. The disjointed look of the build suits the nightmarish nature of the Venom Symbiote as seen in films and comics.</p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Overall opinion</span></strong></p>

<p>This is a great impulse buy set. I feel like it was worth the five dollar asking price, and I feel like it is a worthy addition to my Marvel themed sets. I found mine at a Smith&#39;s Marketplace, although judging by rumors online it might be more commonly seen in Target stores (at least in the US). If you are lucky enough to find this set in a store, don&#39;t pass on the opportunity to get it!</p>

<p>The package is, well, a polybag. &nbsp;Notoriously difficult to get a decent scan of, but otherwise, just a printed bag to be torn open, have the goodness ripped out, and then discarded.</p>

<p><strong>We grow, Sssspider! &nbsp;We grow!</strong></p>

<p>The instructions are pretty easy to follow, as you would expect from a single sheet. &nbsp;I modified the sub-build in step 8, swapping around the parts on one copy to add a more pleasing bilateral symmetry. &nbsp;However, having said that, intentionally breaking the symmetry - which I plan to experiment with - adds to the creepiness of the symbiote. &nbsp;Go with what pleases your aethetics the most.<br />
<br />
<strong>We come together to be sssstronger!</strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s a fairly big part count for this polybag, and having five Venom heads, and seven claws makes this a part-tastic set. &nbsp;I love the 1x3&nbsp;toothed plate - which makes the body the sixth head in effect. &nbsp;The clear 2x2 round on the bottom is a smart way to lend stability to the model without making it look clunky.<br />
<br />
The Mixel joints are used to great purpose. &nbsp;While I don&#39;t care for the Mixels line in general, I am so grateful for these wonderful parts I associate with it.<br />
<br />
If I could make one change it would be to swap out that awful, awful jump plate thing for a web line. &nbsp;They are taking up a small section of my tacklebox storage, unloved, and probably never to be used - save&nbsp;as a cautionary tale.<br />
<br />
<strong>You are sssssmall and weak, Sssspider!</strong></p>

<p>The Spiderman minifigure is nothing new for long-time collectors like myself. &nbsp;But, imagine you&#39;re a kid getting her first superheroes set. &nbsp;This is awesome! &nbsp;You get a hero and a spine-tinglingly cool villian, for instant playablility without breaking the bank. &nbsp;If there had been a new print job, or a rarer one, for this Spiderman, secondary market prices would quickly push the set to well beyond the reasonable. &nbsp;It&#39;s going to become expensive enough in the future as it is.<br />
<br />
And I think that something we tend to forget as AFOLs, is how much we wanted things like this set when we only had a few dollars&#39; worth of allowance. &nbsp;If it gets more kids into LEGO because more parents can justify the cost, then I&#39;m all for it.<br />
<br />
Finally, while it&#39;s not &quot;officially&quot; a minifigure, the Venom Symbiote is totally going in the minfigure display. &nbsp;If anything blurs the lines of how I&#39;d classify a minifigure in my soul, it&#39;s certainly this beautiful black baddie.<br />
<br />
<strong>WE ARE COMPLEEEEEETE!</strong></p>

<p>This is serioulsy one of the best sets I have. &nbsp;It&#39;s awesome, and totally fun to build, and then make a wee diorama for. &nbsp;Even as I write this, my daughter is reconfiguring the claws to make them look more like they are attacking Spiderman. &nbsp;I will probably switch out as many of the grey parts as I can for black, just to appease my tastes, but most kids aren&#39;t likely going to care, because the Symbiote is just so frikken&#39; amazing!<br />
<br />
<strong>Now we are the mosssst powerful!</strong></p>

<p>I paid $6 CAD for mine. &nbsp;I bought three of them. &nbsp;One for me, one for my daughter, and one for whatever reason compels me to buy multiple polybags. &nbsp;Maybe as a gift in the future for my grandchildren. &nbsp;I seriously think I should go buy more - and use the parts to make my Symbiote bigger and badder. &nbsp;It really is excellent value for money. &nbsp;It will definitely go up in price later on the secondary market, so if you see it any where, pay retail! &nbsp;This is a must for any LEGO Marvel Superheroes collection.</p>

"Faefrost","2016-12-16T05:17:22.183Z","A delightfully creepy little Polybag set","<p>Ok there isn&#39;t too much to say about this one. It is a strange and completely unexpected Polybag set. One based around one of the cooler and more disturbing Lego creations ever dreamed up. From Spider-Man we have the Venom Symbiote. This is not the traditional &quot;Black Suit Spider-Man&quot; Venom symbiote bonded to Eddie Brock as we got in an earlier set. This is the amorphous shape shifting un-bonded goo form. The tentacled Lovecraftian Horror. And boy is it MAGNIFICENT! It&#39;s like a macabre evil demonic Mixel. Simply wonderful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What you see on the bag is what you get. Standard traditional Spider-Man (sadly not the 2 color leg version) A useless Super Jumper (otherwise known as the &quot;Leg Breaker&quot;) And the parts for the Symbiote. Lots of angles and hinges. Black Chima type Spider Legs, and Count Em! Five! FIVE! Glorious Venom heads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is possibly the creepiest minifig&nbsp;Lego has ever released. It will give your kid nightmares. But in the best and most fun possible way. fantastic Value for a cheap Polybag.&nbsp;</p>
