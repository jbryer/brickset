<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The standard rectangular box for constraction figures but a little deeper than most. The front shows Baze in a battle on Jedha and the back shows him and two panels indicating the features of his pulse rifle and power pack. The Shoretrooper and Chirrut Imwe are also displayed on the bottom.<br />
There is one rectangular instruction book.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Price per part ratio is as expected for this type of set. A great range of constraction figure parts in a nice dark sandy brown colour and some good red armour elements as well.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Total building time, 10 minutes.<br />
The build is remarkably similar to all other figures in the constraction range with some nice additions to the standard structure that deal with some of the issues from earlier figures. The upper body is where it differs from other figures to allow for to extra layer of armour.<br />
The power pack and pulse rifle are nicely put together and a pretty good attempt at capturing the on-screen look.<br />
Unfortunately, besides the lower right leg pieces, all the other details are stickers. There are 8 in the set, 3 on the torso, two on the chest armour, one on the neck armour and the two pouches on the belt.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>A great figure and a close second to Chirrut Imwe. The head is nicely done and the scar&nbsp;under his left eye is present as well. Due to the armoured pack around his upper body, the issue a lot of people have with a figure&#39;s neck joint is completely concealed for a better overall look.&nbsp;<br />
The power pack and it&#39;s connecting conduit attach securely to his back and the pulse rifle is well done. It has a spring loaded missile launcher which can be activated with the trigger mechanism underneath. There is a connector on the left side to allow you to secure the second red blaster bolt is wanted.<br />
Standing 25 cm tall, he looks impressive on display, especially if paired with his friend, Chirrut Imwe.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Another excellent figure in wave 2. Baze has plenty of poseability and play potential. The only quibble is that the torso piece is not printed like all the other figures and it&#39;s a little reliant on stickers for some of the detailing. That aside, it&#39;s still a great display piece and worth adding to any Star Wars collection.</p>
