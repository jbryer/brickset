<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The standard rectangular box for constraction figures. The front shows the trooper in a battle on Scarif and the back shows him and two panels indicating the features of his E-22 blaster rifle and one of the armour markings. Chirrut Imwe and Baze Malbus are also displayed on the bottom.<br />
There is one rectangular instruction book.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Price per part ratio is as expected for this type of set but for the cost, alternate armour pieces could&#39;ve been included.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Total building time, 10 minutes.<br />
The build is the same straightforward design of the basic constraction armoured figures. A couple of differences to allow for the thermal detonator to be put on the back. The E-22 rifle is nicely done with two firing parts, one spring loaded and one stud shooting.<br />
There are no stickers and the printing for the helmet, left arm, torso and shins are excellent.&nbsp;<br />
The kama is a single small plastic piece with a 4 section pouch printed on the area for the right thigh on the front.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Armoured troopers make for good figures and this one is a nice display piece alongside the others.&nbsp;<br />
The helmet is excellent, nicely styled and beautifully detailed with all the vents, battle damage and markings.<br />
The blue, white and yellow markings on the chest and left arm, coupled with the red flash on the right arm solidly identify this as the Shoretrooper Squad Leader and not the generic Shoretrooper.&nbsp;<br />
Poseability is what you would expect from any figure in the range.<br />
The BlasTech E-22 rifle is nicely done with the double-barrelled weapons represented with a spring loaded missile launcher and a stud shooter underneath. Side range sight and extended stock round off the appearance nicely.<br />
Standing 24 cm tall, it looks great when displayed with any other Rogue One figure, but I have mine alongside Vader and the Deathtrooper.</p>

<p><br />
Overall opinion</p>

<p>A great figure but unlike Chirrut and Baze, this is not without its faults. Making the trooper the Squad Leader doesn&#39;t allow for army building. With the same price point as Baze but over 50 pieces less, a few more plain armour pieces could&#39;ve been added to allow builders to choose what they wanted - much like the options on the Technic Battle Droid from 2000.<br />
Also, as the Squad Leader, the kama is too short as it should come to the knees and it&#39;s the wrong colour, so I custom made a proper one. Also, the Lego copyright text is too prominent and really would&#39;ve been nicer on the reverse side.<br />
It&#39;s also a shame that his thermal detonator is not detachable. This could be easily done but it&#39;s a permanent fixture.<br />
Still, these are minor quibbles to what is still a great figure. While not in the same class as the other two in this wave, it&#39;s a good display piece and another trooper for the armoured forces collection. Hopefully now we have this new helmet design, the Hovertank Pilot will not be released soon.</p>

Anyhow, this was the second buildable figure I wanted after Chirrut on account of how colorful it was. Almost every set so far has been dominated by black, white, gray, or brown, so this was a breath of fresh air.</p>

<p>Starting off with the build, it was a standard figure and therefore a standard build. Only my fourth Star Wars buildable figure and I can already see what people are complaining about when they say the sets are repetitive. The most intriguing part on the figure was&nbsp;the assembly to attach the skirt. Otherwise, it was snap-snap-snap.&nbsp;Building the gun was more fun than I&nbsp;expected. While it lacks in complexity, this set <em>greatly </em>makes up for it in appearance.</p>

<p>Featuring light tan, brown, sand blue, and a dash of red, this figure is the liveliest of all the Star Wars Buildable figures yet in 2018&nbsp;(except maybe the new Boba Fett, but I don&#39;t have him). The prints add an incredible amount of detail and life to this trooper. The detailed shin armor, the stripes on his arm, the brown pouch on the skirt, the sand blue and brown details on the torso, I love it all!&nbsp;And of course the head sculpt is absolutely gorgeous.The gun too has a solid and unique double barreled design.&nbsp;There&#39;s hints of battle damage/wear and tear throughout the printing, giving the sense this is an experienced soldier who knows their way on the battlefield.</p>

<p>As for playability, the set features all 13 standard points of articulation. Incredibly, the skirt barely hinders the set&#39;s poseability, in contrast to my expectations. The soft plastic bends enough to allow the legs to go up nearly 90 degrees. The double barreled gun has&nbsp;<em>two</em>&nbsp;firing features: a spring loaded shooter on top and a stud shooter on the bottom.</p>

<p>While 75523 Scarif&nbsp;Stormtrooper isn&#39;t the most interesting build, it results in a&nbsp;colorful and well detailed figure. It has all the necessary articulation and looks great in many poses. He&#39;s extremely fun to play with, and I can say with certainty he&#39;s one of my favorite constraction figures.</p>
