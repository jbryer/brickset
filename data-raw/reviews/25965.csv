Obviously this","<p>Welcome all to my review&nbsp;of a New York Exclusive Magnet set, The New York Minifigure Magnet is exclusive to all LEGO Stores in the New York state and retails for $4.99 and has 6 pieces giving him a price per part. of 83c.</p>

<p>The magnet is packaged in a plastic box with a cardboard backing. Let&rsquo;s look at everything on offer.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The minifigure included has a nice exclusive torso with &ldquo;New York&rdquo; written but the o in york is a lego apple to represent the Big Apple, all that is printed onto a white torso with blue arms. His legs are fairly rare with the hip piece printed with a belt but the rest of the legs are plain white. His smiling face is a common print with just a smile, eyes and brown eyebrows also his hat is just a common blue cap.</p>

<p><b>Accessory (Magnet)</b></p>

<p>Now this minifigure&nbsp;magnet obviously has a magnet but it isn&rsquo;t a tacky one oh no, it&rsquo;s a awesome hard to find red LEGO&nbsp;magnet piece that is one mold that looks like a 2x4 brick with a a plate hanging out for the&nbsp;figure to attach to. Attached to the front studs is the second exclusive part a 2x4 white tile with the New York skyline printed on in just black lines.</p>

<p><b>______________________________</b></p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>To conclude this review i&rsquo;d say that if you visit any of the NY LEGO Stores get this magnet&nbsp;,or the Statue of Liberty Magnet or the figure in this magnet but in key chain form, instead of a boring postcard. I wish all LEGO Stores had a exclusive magnet or keychain like New York and London Leicester Square. The 2 exclusive&nbsp;prints are awesome and useful. It&rsquo;s a nice thing to have on display as well.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Great USD price, Awesome&nbsp;parts, neat little gift (better than a postcard)</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>None to mention</p>

<p>(This is exclusive to the Flatiron District store and Rockefeller Centre store as i know of but i believe all the other NY Stare stores have this as-well but not&nbsp;100% sure)</p>
