<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Very Simple, the box itself is the actual room of the station, with a slipcover to</p>

<p>prevent any damage to the box.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Actual plastic parts are very few, 9 to be exact, the largest been a 8/16 plate which unfortunately is glued on, a holographic display (with a sticker to put on), 6 other pieces to connect it to the plate, 8 small character trading cards (the 5 Knights &amp; 3 Villains), a double sided play mat featuring the kingdom &amp;&nbsp; volcanic region, instructions (if you call it a piece).Lest but not least what i believe&nbsp;is an Exclusive Nexo power for a knight to use (please don&#39;t ask me what it&#39;s called, but please tell me if someone else knows!)&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are none! (unless you consider the Merlok 2.0 hologram one, then yes).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very simple, so simple the instructions aren&#39;t&nbsp;even needed. The hologram can be moved toward the left &amp; back right.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very simple, just like everything else.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Not overly impressed (opinion hasn&#39;t changes since 1st seeing it). However its not useless, its unfortunate that the plate cant be remover with causing damage (I do like the box), but it can be used as an armory &amp; storing all the contents. So despite yje low opinion of the set, its nice to receive as a freebie.</p>

<p>The nexo&nbsp;knights theme never interested me and Lego promos with cardboard are one of&nbsp;my main Lego pet hates .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build is constructed on&nbsp;a 8&times;16 blue plate which is a cool piece but is ruined by the fact it is glued onto the cardboard yes glued , there is also a small articulated assembly for a digital wizard on a cool piece and there is a nexo knight shield print also included .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>I am just confused what you supposed to do with this set it leaves way to much to the imagination that it isn&#39;t possible to recommend it .</p>
