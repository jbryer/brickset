<p>Aladdin looks great, he&#39;s got bare arms on a double-sided torso print with his little open-chest vest and the belt around his waist. His legs have minor printing, no dual-molding for his bare feet here, and his head is single sided with a happy looking smirk and the scruffy looking hair piece with little fez on it is a great new sculpt.</p>

<p>For accessories he includes the Genie lamp piece. Aladdin is a great minifigure and one of the must-have from this sub-theme. Here&#39;s hoping we&#39;ll see a Disney Series 2 so Jasmine can be included, and Jafar, can&#39;t have an Aladdin without a Jafar. Strongly recommended.</p>
