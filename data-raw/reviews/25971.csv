She&#39;s just a bit of an odd-duck, not a Princess and not one of the more well-respected characters compared to some of the others she&#39;s a bit of a curiosity.</p>

<p>Alice features some nice dual-molded arms with a very sharp blue coloured torso, she features dual-sided printing for her dress and apron... or should that be pinafore? The new skirt piece slides on between the legs and torso and continues the printing fluidly, her legs are plain white with minor black printing on the feet for her shoes.</p>

<p>Her face has a very good print to it and her hair piece is thick and vibrant, a brand new sculpt. She has a small printed stud/tile to eat and get large, while her bottle accessory is printed with drink me on the side for when she needs to get small.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d say she&#39;s a very solid looking figure, the only flaw is in the looseness of her large hair piece and the new skirt limits the movement of her legs, she can&#39;t actually sit down while wearing it. I&#39;d still recommend her, she makes for a nice companion character to display next to Pan and Hook and has some very interesting new parts. Recommended.</p>
