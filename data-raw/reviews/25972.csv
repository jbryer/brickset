<p>Toy Story first came out in 1995 and since then the Aliens have&nbsp;been remembered as the iconic plush squeeze toys&nbsp;who inhabit a claw vending machine they refer to as &quot;The Claw&quot;.</p>

<h3><strong>About the minifigure</strong></h3>

<p>The minifigure is quite spectacular, however the magenta belt should&#39;ve been a dark bluish&nbsp;colour instead. The head piece has appeared in five different sets to date, including&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7598-1/Pizza-Planet-Truck-Rescue"">7598 Pizza Planet Truck Rescue</a>. The most attractive feature for many would of course be the back print and the print on the legs. It is an easier way for people to get their hands on the Little Green Men. On the other hand, the price is not the most attractive part of this set, as with three pieces (excluding the stand), it comes with a high price tag of RM12.90. (USD 3.99).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The printing on the front is superb, except for the belt which for reasons stated above seems slightly different from the original colour seen in the films.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the back print in view, it is quite obvious that the belt print extends round the back of the minifigure, yet the leg&nbsp;print doesn&#39;t. In fact, there appears to be some bleeding around the edge of the legs as the dark blue print stains the bluish leg when seen from the back.</p>

<p>Lastly, the image above shows the side-by-side comparison of the Alien head with a normal minifigure head. It is considerably wider and taller, perhaps due to the fact that the head has o accommodate three eyes.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a great minifigure and the will probably lower the price on the secondary market for the Little Green Men. Now it&#39;s time to wait for Lego to revive the Toy Story theme proper....</p>

The CMF version is re-using parts and doesn&#39;t have much to differentiate it from the original release in the various Toy Story sets.</p>

<p>There is a bit more detailing here. The legs have more printing on the boots and the top is sharper looking I feel compared to the original version. Probably due to the different manufacturing plants involved with the Minifigures. He includes no accessories.</p>

<p>Honestly this is a throw-away addition for the Series, it&#39;s basically here as a re-use of existing LEGO parts from the Toy Story era. I would recommend this to folks who didn&#39;t get the character back then, want a complete set of 18 or really, really love the Little Green Men from Toy Story. Otherwise it&#39;s safe to skip this particular figure.</p>

<p>Again, the best version of Alien, mainly because of the boot printing on the legs that&#39;s also carried on to the side, which&nbsp;is something that the 2010 and 2019 version both didn&#39;t have. The torso is also different to the other versions as well, the belt and collar (the color of the belt is actually inaccurate to the movies, but I really don&#39;t mind, since it makes this version look very unique) printing on the torso are carried on to the back and the Pizza Planet logo on the torso looks very nice as well. The head is still the same mold used for the character, which is fine, the head mold is perfect and accurate to&nbsp;the character, I also noticed that the printing of the eyes were lowered just slightly from the 2010 version. Unfortunately this figure has no accessories, a problem with some figures of this series.</p>

<p>As a minifig that I own, I love it and it&#39;s perfect. This figure was clearly an improvement from the 2010 sets. The problem is, as a figure selection for a minifigure series from Disney, it&#39;s pretty mediocre. There were so many other interesting character choices from the iconic movies that they could&#39;ve picked, and as 1 of the 4 Pixar character choices for the series, it was a pretty odd choice, especially as a figure who already existed in minifig form. I won&#39;t be too hard on the figure though, it&#39;s still a great figure, it&#39;s probably the best figure of the series to get multiples of anyway. I&#39;m glad I own this figure (especially as a huge Toy Story fan), and I still highly recommend if you can find it for a good price.</p>
