<p>Ariel is just another Mermaid Minifig, but she&#39;s got a brand new hair piece that truly captures the look&nbsp;of the character and a unique torso print compared to the previous Mermaids. The print carries over onto the back of the torso, again she only has the one facial expression. I believe this marks the first CMF Series not to include double-sided faces in&nbsp;a long while, at least available at full retail. She has a poor selection of accessories, instead of a &#39;dinglehopper&#39; or Sebastian figure she&#39;s got a clam with a jewel. Not exactly something Ariel concerns herself with.</p>

<p>Strongly recommended. She&#39;s just so well executed and looks so strong, even with the poor choice in accessories Ariel is a must have figure. Ok LEGO, bring on Disney Series 2 for January next year.&nbsp;</p>

The hairpiece&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t really have any lines to simulate strands of hair, which makes it look cheap and unrealistic. Because of this, it doesn&rsquo;t work well with other figures, either. The rest of the figure is kind of &ldquo;meh&rdquo; as well, but the designers didn&rsquo;t have much to work with on her. The clam is the only halfway decent part.</p>
