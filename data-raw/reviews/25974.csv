"Odeinoichus","2017-05-24T16:59:02.64Z","TO INFINITY AND BEYOND!","<p><strong>Set #71012 Buzz Lightyear:</strong> Again we find LEGO giving us another re-use of parts, only this time Buzz is the most detailed he&#39;s ever been and instead of a sculpted head piece he uses an ordinary LEGO minifigure head with proper printing.</p>

<p>Buzz is looking great here, he&#39;s got very detailed leg printing with side-printing to carry the design over to the sides. His torso is mostly bare, with only a slight bit of printing on the bottom to indicate where the bulky armour piece ends. He&#39;s got some side-arm printing for his &#39;laser&#39; and wrist markings. Having never owned him before I have to admit the unique armour piece with the wing attachments is almost perfect. I don&#39;t understand why LEGO chose to make it a half-dome instead of the full dome it&#39;s meant to be when he&#39;s wearing his full space suit, but it just looks phenomenal.</p>

<p>A great minifigure, really worth tracking down if you missed it. Even without any accessories to hold he&#39;s a great looking and highly detailed minifigure, very recommended.</p>

"BigGuy4U","2018-12-25T03:51:20.693Z","Buzz Lightyear to Star Command, come in Star Command.","<p>Buzz Lightyear was one of my favorite characters as a kid, so I knew I had to have this new version of him when it came out.</p>

<p>Buzz comes with three unique parts: his chestplate, helmet, and two wings. These remain unchanged from the original minifig in 2010, although there is little room for improvement other than adding his nametag.</p>

<p>He also comes with a standard minifig head, replacing the original molded head from the Toy Story theme. I personally prefer this head over the original molded one, although it makes him look out of place when displayed with other Toy Story minifigs, like Woody or Jessie.</p>

<p>The real star of the show here is the upgraded printing on his legs and the addition of arm printing and printing on the side of his legs. Unlike the original, there is no torso printing behind the chestplate, although given that this was hidden anyway, it&#39;s not a big deal. The arm printing lacks Buzz&#39;s laser button and Star Command emblem though, so there is slight room for improvement there.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a fantastic improvement on the original Buzz minifig, and I would highly recommend it to any Toy Story fan.</p>
