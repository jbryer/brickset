<p>Hook features a very distinguished and elegant look, decked out in red from head to toe he has dual-molded legs this time with some printing on it for his black boots. He has a lot of nice detailing for his long red coat on the top of his legs and both sides of his torso, he even has his little cuffs printed on the side of his arms. With a pearl gold rapier and a brand new hair piece with his long hair and hat Hook is a masterfully done minifigure.</p>

<p>I definitely recommend Captain Hook. All of the choices for Villains in this Series are rock solid and feature some great looking parts.</p>
