<p>With a uniquely sculpted head piece the Cat&#39;s big grinning smile is unnerving and still innocent. His torso is a rare colour, a pity the printing for the character makes it only useful as his torso, he even has striped arm printing. The legs this time are dual-molded, this gives the stripes on his legs more weight and helps to make him look proper. He also has no accessories, a lot of the Disney Series unfortunately suffered from this.</p>

<p>Do I recommend the Cheshire Cat? Partially, he&#39;s not&nbsp;a bad minifiugre and he&#39;s got a very unique look and colour scheme, but he isn&#39;t a big name Disney star and not a lot of folks will probably be interested in him when they can get more iconic and impressive looking characters. So partially recommended for folks who enjoy collecting every figure from a set or true hard-core Disney fans that want as many official characters in LEGO form as they can get.</p>
