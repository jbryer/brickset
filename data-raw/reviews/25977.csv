Daisy is a later addition compared to some of the others, but she&#39;s still a very iconic character and Donald&#39;s main squeeze.</p>

<p>Daisy has some great parts. She has a dual-molded torso and dual-molded legs, there&#39;s very little printing involved, her white feathers are pretty much white LEGO parts and her outfit is a molded piece. Her feet have printing for her shoes and her torso has a bit of printing for the neckline, but other than that there&#39;s very little printing going on here. Her head is a unique piece, again with minor printing for the eyes and features a hole on top for her iconic bow to plug in.</p>

<p>Daisy has no accessories, no purse or anything, so I can only mildly recommend her as a must have for fans of Disney, I&#39;d strongly recommend her if she&#39;d at least included something especially for her price. The Disney series started another price-hike. She does have a new tail piece though for the duck tail, I really hope they can give us the Nephews and Uncle Scrooge at some point in the future.</p>
