<p>Donald uses the same basic techniques as Daisy, and all of the same pieces except for his hat, which plugs in where the bow would on Daisy&#39;s head. He also includes no accessories and limited printing, as well as dual-molded legs. Donald has a bit more printing with his bow tie, sleeve markings and the back printing for detailing on his outfit. There&#39;s really not much more to say.</p>

<p>Donald is strongly recommended, he&#39;s just a huge favorite character of mine and unlike Daisy I&#39;m really impressed with him. Both of them together compliment each other very nicely. Again strongly recommended.</p>
