<p>The Genie is a very simple design, similar in most aspects to the Series 6 Male Genie, even in similar blue colours. His tail is printed with the red belt and his arms have printing for the golden shackles he wore, his head uses a regular minifigure head with a new head piece with large ears and the Pirates/Forestmen feather piece attached to a small hole for his little tuft of hair. He includes a lamp too.</p>

<p>Genie has a great looking facial print that truly captures his look on screen, however he isn&#39;t much of a great Minifigure. It might have been nice to include an extra pair of regular legs for when he walks around with feet instead of floating around with his tail. I&#39;d still recommend this figure because he&#39;s just a must-have character. And so far the only representation of a Robin Williams role in LEGO form.</p>

It&#39;s one of those figures where it looks better when you physically have it.</p>

<p>He&#39;s got some great printing all around, like his genie bottom piece having a red line printed on there, which is also printed on the side and back which is some amazing detailing. The torso has basic printing for the front and no back printing (which is fine, not really that necessary for this figure), and the arms have his bracelet cuffs printed on them with a gold shine to it which looks phenomenal. The face print really captured the look of the character in my opinion with a big and somewhat sincere grin and it was my favorite part of the figure. His top head piece was a new mold introduced with this figure , its got the two big genie ears with a gold earring molded on the right ear and not molded on the other side, which was some great accuracy to the character. There was also an accessory hole at the top where you place his tuft of hair on, the hair tuft piece seems like it was printed in pearl gold and painted &nbsp;black for the hair portion (if you have the Scrooge McDuck minifigure, you could put his top hat piece on it, and BOOM, you got&nbsp;an entertainer Genie). The last&nbsp;part of the figure is the lamp accessory, it kinda sucks that it was the same one as Aladdin&#39;s, but this figure IS&nbsp;the Genie in the lamp, so it&#39;s probably more so&nbsp;the problem with the Aladdin figure, so I don&#39;t mind the inclusion here because it makes sense.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll admit this ain&#39;t one of the better figures of the series, but its&nbsp;got a lot of good qualities and the general appearance was very accurate to the iconic character. The parts you get here are pretty good as well and overall, I think this is a great figure and is still a bit underrated for this series, if you&#39;re able to find this for a good price on BrickLink,I highly recommend it for a purchase, especially if you&#39;re a Disney fan.</p>
