Certainly the strongest female villain they ever created, though some may argue that point.</p>

<p>Maleficent is of course a standard robed minifigure, meaning that she uses the sloped brick for her lower torso. Her printing is very iconic with the rich black robes highlighted by purple trim. She includes two cape pieces, both of which have some dual-sided coloured materials. One side is black, the other purple a nice royal purple. Her staff is pearl gold tipped with a yellow jewel and her head piece is a new part with her iconic horns made out of a softer abs plastic.</p>

<p>Overall Maleficent is one of the big winners of this series, and arguably the best villain in the set. I definitely recommend this one, she is just gorgeous and really fun.</p>
