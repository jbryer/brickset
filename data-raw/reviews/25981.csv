<p>I would say Mickey is the weakest figure executed out of the four Disney Icons included in this series, mostly because his torso has no printing and his legs suffer. The little buttons that attach to his shorts are printed too low on his dual-molded legs. It would have benefited from including printing on the lower torso to make the shorts he wears look better attached.</p>

<p>I&#39;d still recommend Mickey, he&#39;s one of the most iconic characters known worldwide, but honestly I think the version in the Disney Castle is much better as a representation for folks just looking to own one version of the character. If you&#39;re out to get a complete set of 18 you&#39;ll need him, otherwise just get the Castle.</p>
