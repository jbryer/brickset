<p>Minnie, like Daisy and Donald before her has dual-molded legs, her feet are printed for her shoes, her torso is also dual-molded for the arms with the short-sleeved look. Like with Donald before her she has more detailing than Daisy, with printing around the waist for her belt, and a bit of printing with a button and&nbsp;neck-frill for her top. She&#39;s using the new skirt piece which is printed with polka dots to match her bow accessory, which plugs in to the top of her unique sculpted head piece just like with Donald and Daisy.</p>

<p>Overall Minnie is one of the stronger offerings and I&#39;d definitely recommend her. Be aware that like Alice she can&#39;t actually sit while wearing that new skirt piece, it&#39;ll need to be removed if you want to put her into any vehicle models.</p>
