<p>Mr. Incredible is the Parr family Patriarch, this is the version in his red outfit. He&#39;s got dual-molding all around, with dual-molded arms and legs. Single-sided torso printing featuring his iconic logo and some printing for the tights around his... you know. He includes a printed tile with one of his old posters and a unique new hair piece that&#39;s only him. Still no duald-sided head though, none of the figures so far has had more than one expression.</p>

<p>Definitely recommend Mr. Incredible, and I really hope Elasti-Girl, Violet and Dash will be included in a future Series or two. There are enough Disney characters they could continue producing CMF sets for twenty years if they wanted.</p>
