<p>Peter features a brand new head piece with his little green hat, scruffy hair and elfin ears and the red feather, it&#39;s a great new piece with so many potential uses. Again he has dual-molded legs and torso, with short sleeves on the arms and minor printing for the frayed edges of his shirt-sleeves and extra printing on the legs to enhance the look. His accessories are actually gold, not silver as the official image indicates and I&#39;m not entirely sure why they changed it.</p>

<p>Overall I strongly recommend Pan, he&#39;s one of the better offerings from this series and has so many uses with his parts and print.</p>

<p>Peter pan is an iconic character that Lego nailed in 2016s Disney series one , but one part of the figure was falsely advertised .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The hat , hair and eat combo is an exclusive dual moulded part accurate to the 2D animated character , the head showcases a thrilled expression , the torso is simplistic but perfect , the arms are dual moulded and feature subtle rip prints on the sleeves and the legs are also dual moulded with side and front printing .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>His accessories include two GOLD daggers which for some reason are advertised as silver everywhere which is really false advertisement . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is an exceptional figure from an exceptional series and ignoring the false advertisement&nbsp; it is just too good not to recommend .</p>
