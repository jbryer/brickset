<p>Stitch first appeared in the movie&nbsp;<em>Lilo&nbsp;&amp; Stitch</em> as the 626th&nbsp;creation of&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Lilo_%26_Stitch_characters#Jumba_Jookiba"" title=""List of Lilo &amp; Stitch characters"">Dr. Jumba Jookiba</a>&nbsp;who aspired to create a creature capable of causing havoc and destruction across the galaxy. However, throughout the course of the movie, Stitch ends up developing a more loving soul.</p>

<p><strong>About the minifigure</strong></p>

<p>It is a wonderful minifigure&nbsp;as is entirely unique in terms of parts as the entire minifigure&nbsp;has superb printing across its medium-blue body and head. The head alone has four different colours, excluding medium-blue. The protruding ears even have small notches, which reflects the figure&#39;s accuracy to the film. Each leg has four dark-blue toes printed upon it. My only criticism would be that the torso piece seems to be a different shade of blue than the rest of the molded parts, including the arms and hands. Perhaps a different batch of plastic?</p>

<p>With the back print in view, it&#39;s clear that Stitch is an outstanding minifigure, where the dark-blue prints are used to bring out Stitch&#39;s unique fur colours.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s a great minifigure, but as usual it the only qualm I have seems to be the price&nbsp;of RM12.90. (USD 3.99). Yet, who doesn&#39;t want to have in their possession the creature that taught us the meaning of&nbsp;<em>ohana</em></p>

The first Disney inspired sets included Mickey, Minnie and Winnie the Pooh. Then they strengthened their bonds to the point that we finally got some impressive sets, and now a great looking Collectible Minifigures Series.</p>

<p>Stitch as a Minifigure is pretty impressive, he&#39;s got a fully sculpted and molded head piece that captures the look of this character perfectly, with large expressive eyes and huge ears for detecting sounds everywhere. His torso is printed on both sides, the belly on the front and the markings on the back, and his legs included limited printing for his toes. He includes no accessories.</p>

<p>Stitch is a strong contender, however he&#39;s a bit lacking without Lilo to pair him up with. Hopefully a future series will include her as a companion for her best friend. I&#39;d also like to see a costumed Stitch in the future as a variant with his space suit on and futuristic energy blasters. Like with most of this series I strongly recommend him, I&#39;m just a huge Disney fan and this series of CMFs is superb.</p>
