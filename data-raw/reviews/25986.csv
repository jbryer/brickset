No one will be...""","<p>As a loyal, slightly obsessive Pixar fan, as well as a loyal, overly obsessed minifigure collector, when I found out that there was going to be a series of Collectible Disney Minifigures I crossed my fingers and hoped that some Pixar characters would leak into the mix. When I found out that two of those characters were Mr. Incredible and Syndrome, I was extremely excited! Popping into the store right on May 1st, I was able to get my hands on both, and while Mr. Incredible was great, Syndrome stood out in a way that he just didn&#39;t. Naturally, my fandom makes me love this minifigure, but to the average LEGO enthusiast, is this figure worth killing your fingers trying to feel for in the blind bags? Or is it one that can be passed on in favor&nbsp;of others? Read on to see for yourself...</p>

<h2>The Completed Minifigure:</h2>

<p>Let me just say this right now. In terms of accuracy to the source material, this minifigure is <em>amazing.&nbsp;</em>Like,&nbsp;<em>italicized amazing.</em>&nbsp;Every detail you&#39;d expect to see, such as the large &#39;S&#39; insignia, the flame-like hair, and the evil (in a nerdy sort of way) grin on his face are there, but plenty of little details like the controls on the gauntlets, the silver attachments on his boots that provide the rocket boot function (something I&#39;d never noticed before) and the freckles on his face are all captured wonderfully. The only detail I can see that isn&#39;t here, is that in the movie, the inside of Syndrome&#39;s cape was dark blue, but looking at all the other aspects of this minifigure this can definitely be overlooked! The part themselves on this minifigure I think are also very useful, as his legs and arms are dual molded parts: I can especially see the arms being repurposed&nbsp;because of the gauntlets. Syndrome&#39;s single accessory&nbsp;appears to mimic the tablet-like device Mr. Incredible is given by Mirage to brief him on the mission to take down the omnidroid (the tablet at one point shows the schematic of the omnidroid, as can be seen here:&nbsp;<a href=""https://qntm.org/files/omnidroids/omnidroid_07_4.jpg"">https://qntm.org/files/omnidroids/omnidroid_07_4.jpg</a>) While Syndrome is never seen with this, I think that the tablet is a unique and creative accessory to give him, making me wonder why LEGO couldn&#39;t apply this same thinking to many of the&nbsp;other Disney minifigures that lack accessories.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts:</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re a Pixar fan, this minifigure is undoubtedly a must have. Probably my favorite collectible minifigure&nbsp;of all time, Syndrome makes for a fun minifigure who successfully&nbsp;mimics the source material, contains some great parts, and has more playability value than some of the others in this series since his adversary Mr. Incredible is also available. Whether&nbsp;you can try to snag online&nbsp;or you&#39;re dedicated enough to feel for it in store, I highly recommend that you get yourself a Syndrome Minifigure. You will not be disappointed.</p>

He has a sinister looking expression and a dangerous plan to put an end to Supers everywhere, watch out Mr. Incredible and The Avengers.</p>

<p>Syndrome has dual-molded arms and legs again. Honestly this is he largest set of figures to feature dual-molding outside of the Simpsons I believe. He&#39;s got some nice printing for his boots and arm tech, and includes a printed tile with the blueprints to his Omnidroid 07.</p>

<p>Syndrome is a great character and only the second villain included in this Disney Series. I recommend him, he&#39;s very well detailed and looks truly sinister. Even his hair piece is menacing with that flaming orange colour choice. Recommended.</p>
