"dcmal","2016-05-17T00:04:06.157Z","Poor unfortunate soul","<p>This minifigure is a decent representation of Ursula, the sea witch from the Little Mermaid movie. It is certainly a decent representation of the character, including&nbsp;a print of the little&nbsp;snail shell holding Arielle&#39;s&nbsp;voice.</p>

<p>To the best of my knowledge, this is the first Lego minifigure with an actually protruding bosom. Unfortunately, the bosom is part of the lower half of the minifigure. This means that if you try to recombine the tentacles with other minifigure parts, the result always looks like Ursula somehow.</p>

<p>Another missed opportunity is that the octopus tentacles cannot actually hold on to anything. Although two tentacles on Ursula&#39;s right are precisely positioned and shaped to accommodate a rod, there is no clutch at all and nothing can actually be fixed to the figure. On Ursula&#39;s left, the tentacles are not even shaped accordingly. None of the curling tentacles&#39; vertical holes have been sized to accommodate a minifigure tool grip either.</p>

<p>Overall, the minifigure works quite well as Ursula, but not very much beyond that.</p>

<p>Ursula&#39;s detailing is all in the torso and face, she features a nice dual-sided torso print with her black dress and purple skin visible, her head has that sinister looking smile and her hair piece is unique in white with grey markings printed on the sides. Her accessory is the Trident piece of course, and her lower torso is just so well designed and executed for a minifigure, it reminds me of the awesome pieces created during the Atlantis era.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend Ursula, she&#39;s a great looking minifigure and that new lower torso is just so creative and fun. I hope we&#39;ll get many more Series to come with a lot of great villains in the future.</p>
