<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed figures look amazing and are well detailed. The Ice Queen ( I am guessing is her name) has wonderful printing on her torso and slope piece, the face is very fitting and I love the misty pieces of trans-clear ice powers. These are held in place by 2 of the new spider web pieces released for Spider Man this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Boxer Girl (I think that is her name) also looks great she comes with dual faces and is very expressive in both iterations. There are no swapable&nbsp;hand pieces included but you do get a cylinder piece to hold her protective helm while she is not using it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mariachi Player looks great as well. He has priting along the side of his legs and his chest print is also very well done. The mold for his guitar, however, is the highlight for me. He can hold it in many ways thus allowing for great poses. Sadly, it does not seem to be held fully by the hands but that is OK.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Spy has great printing on his legs and torso as well as a small print on his left arm. He comes with a rope piece in black a new hair mold that allows for visor pieces to be inserted and a nozzle (gun) piece. In addition he gets a backpack(parachute pack) which looks nice.&nbsp;The only downside I have noticed to him his the goggles tend to droop a bit since there is nothing beneath the hair piece to actually hold it in place. Moving the goggle piece upside down into the pins seems to remedy this a bit better.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great start for my collection of these figures. Having never owned any of these from any series before I was pleasantly surprised by both the quality of the prints and the parts included for these figures. Now I gotta cross my fingers and hope I get the babysitter and hiker figures my next trip to the store.&nbsp;</p>
