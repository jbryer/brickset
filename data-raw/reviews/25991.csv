"8BrickMario","2016-08-09T22:11:31.673Z","Seriously cool!","<p>The Ice Queen was one of the first Series 16 minifigures to attract me, and I sought her out when I saw them in stores. How well did she live up to my expectations?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Series 16 packaging uses a bright yellow color. All of the minifigures are shown nicely on the checklist, and instructions for the Ice Queen and Cute Little Devil&#39;s assembly are shown. Since&nbsp;<em>LEGO Minifigures Online</em>&nbsp;is no more, the back features an advertisement for the Minifigures site on Lego.com instead.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Ice Queen&#39;s parts are very nice, especially the two &quot;blast attachment&quot; pieces which are used with the ice beams, recolored Elemental Blades from Ninjago.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Ice Queen looks great. Her color scheme is silver, white, and blues, and she looks suitably powerful and cold. Her tiara is a new piece, which is chunkier and more geometric, which, along with the translucent blue color, makes it look like ice. Her hair is the queen hairstyle we&#39;ve seen on Mrs. Claus before. Her skin is light aqua, and her face shows an frowning expression, with jagged eyebrows, white spiky eyeshadow, and silver lips. Her cape and collar are&nbsp;soft, and sparkly on one side, with an uneven jagged edge. Her torso and dress slope are well-printed, using&nbsp;minimal spiky ice printing&nbsp;which harkens back to the classic figures of LEGO&#39;s&nbsp;early days. Her dress is nice, but the straps on the front look out of place, considering that she has sleeves and a cape. Some white jagged designs feature on her arms, at the cuff area. The Ice Queen can hold her icy blasts as if punishing an unlucky servant.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This figure is very pretty and very useful. Anything winter-themed will suit her, whether in a holiday or fairy tale setting, and she&#39;s gorgeous on her own. She&#39;s definitely one of the best figures of the series.</p>

<br />
This looks like it should be a main antagonist in a revised Fantasy Castle theme. &nbsp;Sword weilding snowmen, armored yeti, crystaline&nbsp;ice demons bearing down on the slumbering valley kingdom, in fearsome war sledges, riding polar bear cavalry, all at the command of the Ice Queen of the Unknown Northern Realms.<br />
<br />
Actually, now that I see that written down, it seems even more awesome than I thought. &nbsp;TLG, I don&#39;t care if you take that idea and run with it, I just want gratis copies of all sets.<br />
<br />
I like every piece of this minifigure. &nbsp;The blue ice crown in the sable hair. &nbsp;The two part sparkly cape, &nbsp;The printed silver, blue and white body. &nbsp;The new barred studs that hold the beams of icy power. &nbsp;The frosty frown and subtle eye-shadow.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s the must-have minifigure, destined to be released only in the largest set of a sub-theme I think we need to see happen.</p>

To start it off is number one on the checklist the Ice Queen, our first female minifig from the set and one that many compare to a certain extremely popular Disney franchise.</p>

<p>The Ice Queen is a blue-skinned character, her dress is a sloped brick with a regular torso as is often the case with some great printing, she has a mixture of icy blues and white with silver highlights making her torso and sloped brick lower body look quite beautiful. She features side-arm printing and a unique pair of light-blue hands.</p>

<p>Her hair piece was used quite a few times before, I believe I first saw it on the Series 7 Bride, however it may have been introduced as a part before then. All I know is this time it&#39;s white and includes a clear blue crown piece. Her cloak is made with two cape pieces with a shimmering effect on one side. For accessories LEGO used the new single stud grip parts quite effectively to give her ice blast effects using Ninjago blade elements in ice blue colours.</p>

<p>Overall this is a great looking Minifigure and a great first offering from Series 16, and so I&#39;d strongly recommend her as one of the better offerings from this set. If you don&#39;t already own one I&#39;d track one down ASAP, she&#39;s a must have figure.</p>
