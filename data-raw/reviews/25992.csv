<br />
Honestly, I&#39;m very easy to please with the CMF lines. &nbsp;I like variety, and that&#39;s enough to keep me buying all of them.<br />
<br />
However, my like for this minifigure&nbsp;goes well beyond that.<br />
<br />
I could see him easily paired with a twin guard, forbidding entry to the Caliph&#39;s chamber, or protecting the treasury from theives.<br />
<br />
I could see an infantry of these guys locked in battle with Crusaders and rival kingdoms.<br />
<br />
I like the green turban, and the hint of pointed boots. &nbsp;The bare chest is a nice touch, rarely seen on warrior figures.</p>

<p>But mostly, I&#39;m pleased to get some minifigures of a Middle Eastern origin. &nbsp;One day, I plan to build a Museum of History in my City, and I would love to have more than just Egypt representing the varied people of that region. &nbsp;I would love to see even more minifigures inspired by Arabs, Persians, Israelis, the various people of Africa, and more.<br />
<br />
I really hope this is just the first of many more to come.</p>

<p>Desert Warrior features dual-molded legs with minor printing for a sash which carries down from his torso print which is a bare-chested look with a belt and strap. This print is dual-sided, his face is plain and simply with a small beard and mustache. Using the new turban in dark green completes the overall look and presenting a brand new massive scimitar-like blade for him enhances his appearance. (I believe this blade is new, though it may have first seen use long ago in the Orient Expedition sub-theme, or at least be a new piece inspired by the older blade.)</p>

<p>Overall this is a pretty decent offering and a great looking army builder for fans of large displays and MOCs with generic looking soldiers. He&#39;s got some good parts too, so I definitely recommend picking this one up.</p>
