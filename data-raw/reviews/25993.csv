<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are pretty decent, but I think the armor and the translucent orange hollow stud will be the most useful in different contexts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure.&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The Cyborg is the second lady to use the Larry hair, here in medium blue with silver streaks, which looks nice and suits her military vibe. Her face is great, with a vaguely sci-fi&nbsp;edge to her makeup on the human side, and the robot side is really cool, being done in metallic silver with azure&nbsp;outlines and green circuitry-style skeletal features that imitate the classic LEGO skull. On neither side is she very amused. She reuses the Galaxy Trooper/Ultra Agents armor, and it&#39;s decorated with more blue lines&nbsp;and a metal plate that matches the rest of her bionics, as well as her squad number, 4-9. On the left shoulder pad is an emblem of a half-skull classic minifigure head inside a gear&nbsp;to match her, Her torso underneath is unprinted, which is fine, but her right arm is printed with more robotic detail, and her hand is grey to hammer the bionics home. Her legs have some similar lining and blue hips, with another metal plate, and the side of her left leg is printed with machinery, making her entirely asymmetrical. She comes with the Galaxy Squad gun with a stud attachment, which can be clipped onto her armor when not in use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>She&#39;s a really cool figure. She definitely stands out among her fellow LEGO ladies, and she&#39;s just a fun sci-fi&nbsp;design with lots of detail. She fits neatly into a lot of space-style stuff, and she&#39;s a nice figure regardless.</p>

<p>The Cyborg is a female character with a plain black torso, her right arm is the only printed element, she&#39;s wearing a bulky Galaxy Trooper armour piece over her plain torso to bulk up and feature more printing. Her legs have a lot of printed detail work showing the mechanical detailing of this part person, part cybernetic character.</p>

<p>Using the Two-Face print technique she features some great mechanical detailing on one side of her face while the other side is ordinary, so ordinary in fact that she still finds time to put makeup on her face, as there&#39;s some eyeshadow and lipstick there to show that she&#39;s a girl. Her hair piece is a newer one, possibly first seen on Sabine Wren, or perhaps similar to it, the electirc blue colouring makes it difficult to identify 100%, but it&#39;s a great colour for a unique looking figure.</p>

<p>I&#39;d strongly recommend this one for the parts, she&#39;s got a lot of potential for fans of MOCs. Even if she is just carrying an ordinary space blaster piece with a clear orange stud attached for the barrel. Great figure.</p>
