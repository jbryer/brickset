<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are really nice, with the reuse of the Gargoyle&#39;s wings, yet another pumpkin bucket, a black trident, and a devil cap and tail.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>While I&#39;m slightly disappointed that this minifigure is a costume, not a real monster, I still like him a lot. His cap is a new piece, though similar to the Bumblebee Girl&#39;s. It has a widow&#39;s peak shape and two black horns. The face is cute, being the child style in a goofy smile with his tongue sticking out. His wings are solid red, but appropriate. His torso print is very simple, showing a sweatshirt design with pockets and a zipper. He has a new tail, with the pointed end typical of the cartoon devil, and its shape has some nice movement to it. He has short red legs. His pumpkin bucket is very similar to the Skeleton Guy&#39;s but it features a cuter face print. He carries a black trident for the archetypal pitchfork.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This minifigure is very cute, and a great addition to the Halloween scene. His parts are very useful for custom devils or demons, too. I&#39;d recommend him.</p>

"Zac","2016-10-25T02:22:38.123Z","Trick or Treater","<p>Some of the Collectible Minifigures seem rather one-dimensional, but this &ldquo;Cute Little Devil&rdquo; has a great deal of character. His grin is endearingly ambiguous, inviting us to make up a story for him. Has this little devil just played a mischievous prank, or is he only enjoying some treats?</p>

<p>The part selection is remarkably versatile. The pumpkin could be used as either a trick-or-treating bucket or a jack o&rsquo; lantern; the print differs from last year&rsquo;s &ldquo;Skeleton Guy&rdquo; in its round eyes and toothier smile, which give it a classic spooky quality compared to the previous year&rsquo;s laughing pumpkin. The pumpkin printing continues onto the back. The trident in black could easily be appropriated for a graveyard ornament, farm tool, or architectural detail. The torso simply represents a sweatshirt and could appear on any street scene.</p>

<p>The costume elements&mdash;tail, wings, and horned beanie&mdash;could just as easily adorn a Mephistopheles or a fancy partygoer as a trick-or-treater, and their detail is outstanding. The wings are made of polycarbonate and are harder than the usual ABS while the tail is made of a softer plastic (I don&rsquo;t know the name). Both are wonderfully curved.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised by the cute character of this trick-or-treater, and certainly recommend him.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-09-04T17:27:23.593Z","Belated Halloween Costumed Character","<p><strong>Set #71013 Cute Little Devil:</strong> Another Halloween Costume that we&#39;ve all seen many times on October 31st.</p>

<p>Dressed all in red the Cute Little Devil is a boy out trick-or-treating. He&#39;s got a unique head piece with tiny horns on the top, which would have quite a few uses for fans of gothic horror or Halloween inspired display pieces. His torso is simple with a zipper print and some pockets. He has red gargoyle wings on his back and a forked tail piece, his accessories include the printed pumpkin bucket piece and a black pitchfork.</p>

<p>A somewhat weaker offering from the Theme, but a charming looking figure and one I&#39;d still recommend as he&#39;d fit in quite nicely with the Holiday Vignettes and other sets such as Monster Fighters for Halloween displays or MOCs. The fact that he&#39;s sticking his tongue out is all-the-more reason for having some fun with this figure.</p>

"redbeardlegoman","2017-06-03T05:16:19.913Z","All Treat, No Tricks.","<p>The first and most obvious benefits of this little darling&#39;s release is that 1) the skeleton costume guy has a friend to go trick or treating with, and 2) that jack o&#39; lantern bucket is going to be cheaper to get in larger quantities.<br />
<br />
I would love to see another bucket - a skeleton, or a witch face.<br />
<br />
And though realistically you could pretty much make any minifigure a Hallowe&#39;en costume just adding the bucket, I rather like that there&#39;s another purpose-made one.<br />
<br />
I love that those demon wings are available in another colour as well. &nbsp;If I get my wish, they&#39;ll be released in green, which I will automatically mix with the Alien Trooper&nbsp;from Series 13, and make him the Cthulhu he was always destined to be. &nbsp;A green tail would help, too, hint hint TLG.<br />
<br />
Of course I also want to make a real Satan figure out of this, and/or a horde of demons, because that would be awesome! &nbsp;I could even have my moc&#39;ed up Satan fighting against the Series 15 Flying Warrior (or even armies of the same).<br />
<br />
And that face... &nbsp;I love it! &nbsp;He is totally a mischievous imp. &nbsp;Put it on some guy coming out of a bar, bottle in hand, and instant drunk!<br />
<br />
I love this little guy. &nbsp;He&#39;s one of my all-time favourites.<br />

The figure itself can be used in a Halloween/Trick&nbsp;or Treat MOC, The top piece&nbsp;can be used to make an actual&nbsp;devil, his head can be used just about anywhere, the wings and tale, as well as the red midget pants, are also useful. The red shirt print tops this minifigure of.</p>
