<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Spooky Boy&#39;s parts are very nice, featuring some nice edgy clothes and Larry&#39;s hair in black. If you needed a LEGO spider, you can get one here.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Spooky Boy is a bit tonally different from his predecessor, but he&#39;s still nice. Like the Girl, he&#39;s entirely monochrome. His face shows a worried or skeptical frown, sunken eyes, and a pointy tooth. Maybe he&#39;s a vampire, maybe he&#39;s just plain spooky. His torso shows a simple black t-shirt with the classic LEGO skull, and his sleeves are dual-molded. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a coincidence that his lower sleeves are grey with black stripes, as this matches the design of Pugsley Addams&#39; shirt. I like these subtle homages with the spooky kids.The Spooky Boy is wearing grey pants with a belt and a chain which goes around the side of his left leg. His legs are dual-molded to show heavy black boots with metal toes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His accessories are a simple spider, and a book of Spooky Tales. This is the older style of book, but it fits the feel of an ancient tome.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Get him! He&#39;s a great successor and companion to the Spooky Girl, and another spooky character to add to your collection.</p>

<p>This minifigure features dual-molded legs and arms, and much like the Spooky Girl he is mostly monochrome in design and print with grey/white and black colouring. His print features is really fun, the pants feature some light tears a long chain and his feet have boots on them. The LEGO Skeleton is on his shirt and he&#39;s got black stripes printed on his lower sleeves.</p>

<p>The accessories are also quite suitable, with an older LEGO Book piece printed with cobwebs and the title Spooky Tales, and a regular black spider element. his hair piece is straight black and his facial print is very somber looking with a snaggletooth sticking out one side of his mouth, perhaps this Spooky Boy has vampiric tendencies?</p>

<p>He&#39;s a great looking figure, I&#39;d definitely recommend this one as a must have, especially for the parts and print details that look great and will make excellent outfit parts for mix-and-match MOC figures.</p>
