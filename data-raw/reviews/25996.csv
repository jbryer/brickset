<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The Hiker comes in a foil pack, as do all CMFs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Hiker comes with appropriately tousled hair for an adventurer of his caliber. His backpack is a new mold in light and darker blue. It accurately reflects a typical backpacker&#39;s backpack. Two tiles are included: a map and a compass. The map is a 2x2 tile referring to the Greeble Trail, an allusion to the small detailing often found on larger MOCs to break up blank spaces. The compass is a clear 1x1 tile with a compass pattern printed upon it. Both are excellent accessories and quite useful in other applications.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Hiker is attired with a&nbsp;brand new windbreaker torso which includes printed straps for his backpack. The legs are nicely printed with pockets and double molded to give the impression of hiking boots.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The Hiker is a pretty basic minifig with no special construction requirements.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Again, it&#39;s the minifig.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The Hiker is probably not a figure you want an army of, but it is worth picking&nbsp;up. The backpack element and compass make him&nbsp;quite attractive.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This set comes in a mystery pack, so you don&#39;t know what minifigure out of the 16 in the series you will end up with!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has some very cool parts!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The backpack is a very cool, good looking part. It has duel&nbsp;molding in two different colors of blue. It has a rolled up sleeping bag that is molded in light blue with the rest of the backpack in dark blue. The two prints in the set: The map and the AWESOME compass are both out of this world! The head has a second side that has a very realistic lost-face!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The figure itself is also very cool. The torso has a print that has the backpack straps from&nbsp;the backpack looking very realistic. He is wearing a green zip-up hoodie. His pants are duel molded also, in tan and brown.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This set is very easy to build, considering&nbsp;that it only had 8 parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>THIS SET IS AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! it looks sooooooooooooo cool when you are done building and is ready to set off on a hike.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is well worth the $4.99 price!!! I love the backpack and compass so much. I recommend this set for any LEGO fan!</p>

<p>The Hiker features dual-molded legs with plain brown boots and light tan pants, or possibly hiking shorts. He&#39;s got some pockets and a belt printed on it, the torso however is very detailed with a slightly darker green plain ABS used showing a multicoloured jacket with blues, greens and whites, some dark blue straps meant to evoke his backpack element is also included.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the first double-sided facial print, with a big happy smile on one side and a lost looking expression on the other, apparently even with his printed map and compass elements he&#39;s gone and gotten himself lost. The backpack accessory is brand new and looks great, I can&#39;t wait to see this part used in LEGO City Camping sets in different colours for some great reuses of the part.</p>

<p>While being a bit of a weaker offering from the set he&#39;s still got a strong overall look to him and would fit in perfectly with your Fun in the Park set or other LEGO City displays. I&#39;d recommend him because of that and his very useful new map print, which features something different from the same old Pirates map prints we&#39;ve seen time and time again in the past.</p>

"donner89","2020-08-07T16:23:07.55Z","Awesome minifig - my favorite from Series 16","<p>As an avid hiker myself, this minifig immediately got my attention and was one of the first CMF I went out of my way to obtain.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start at the top and work our way down:</p>

<p><strong>Hair </strong>- A&nbsp;good set of hair, nothing crazy or special to point out</p>

<p><strong>Face </strong>- He has two expressions - a joyfull smile and an uncertain/second guessing smirk. I think both work great with this guy. When posing/playing with this, you can make him happy that he&#39;s out and exploring the world&nbsp;or you can have the uncertain expression to show an &#39;uh oh, i took a wrong turn&#39; look.</p>

<p><strong>Upperbody </strong>- While the back is just green, the front makes up for it and really pairs well with the backpack. You&#39;ve got a green/blue jacket and then the straps from the backpack coming in, which really complements the backpack accessary nicely. The backpack itself is nice too - it&#39;s a great blue color with a rolled up sleeping back at the top.</p>

<p><strong>Lowerbody </strong>- Decent set of cargo pants with some brown boots</p>

<p><strong>Additional accessories</strong> - You get a compass and a map. The compass is straightforward and the map has some good details, the &quot;Greeble Trail&quot; is a nice reference to a certain building technique.</p>

<p><strong>Overall </strong>- It&#39;s a great minifig, easily my favorite from Series 16.&nbsp;</p>
