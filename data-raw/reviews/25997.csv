<br />
I love that my daughter gets to see that kind of positive reinforcement of the idea that she should follow her dreams whatever they may be. &nbsp;Getting that message out to children early may be one of the ways we redeem our species.<br />
<br />
So I find it very nice to see a woman working as a wildlife photographer in the antarctic.<br />
<br />
I also find it pleasing for two other biographical reasons.<br />
<br />
1) &nbsp;I once applied for a job working at McMurdo base as a cook. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t get it, and went to Japan instead. &nbsp;Which turned out just as well, because my wife and daughter are Japanese.<br />
<br />
2) I&#39;m a life-long photographer, and would certainly have been taking photos of penguins at every opportunity. &nbsp;Now, I can make my sig-fig do exactly that.<br />
<br />
And that&#39;s because in yet another delightful addition to the Lego Zoo, we have a penguin!<br />
<br />
I love the brick built penguins that usually come with Batman v The Penguin sets, but I would be a filthy liar if I said I didn&#39;t also adore this molded penguin.<br />
<br />
However, the pure icing on this cake of utter awesome is that I firmly believe that it was inspired by Science Please Penguin.<br />
<br />
If you don&#39;t know Science Please Penguin, do yourself a favour and Google that right now. &nbsp;You&#39;ll be so glad you did.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-09-04T19:29:47.75Z","Another Great New Animal","<p><strong>Set #71013 Wildlife Photographer:</strong> Here comes a great Minifigure and a great new animal piece, the first of its kind and different from the LEGO Friends version of the creature.</p>

<p>This photographer would fit in well with LEGO City Arctic, she&#39;s got a dark red and blue winter outfit with dual-molded printing for the legs, the arms and a double-sided torso print for her jacket details. She&#39;s wearing the new fur-covered hood piece and has a nice dual-sided facial print, one side with a smile and wearing protective goggles the other winking, or perhaps peeking through the viewfinder with one eye closed as some professionals are known to work.</p>

<p>The penguin is a great accessory, he&#39;s a brand new piece with a stud on the back to attach things to and excellent looking detail work. She also includes a camera, and is often the case, a single hollow stud is used to add depth to the lens of the camera.</p>

<p>I strongly recommend getting multiples of this one if you can find anymore, I wish I&#39;d at least gotten two for that neat new animal piece, but I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll see it again now that it&#39;s been introduced. Overall a great minifigure from Series 16.</p>
