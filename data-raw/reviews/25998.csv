Who knew?","<p><strong>Set #71013 Kickboxer:</strong> Another use for those boxing gloves, instead of being an ordinary female boxer this one is a Kickboxer, however it&#39;s clear she&#39;s meant to be the counterpart to the male from Series 5.</p>

<p>With dual-molded legs to show her wearing white shorts with red boots, there&#39;s a lot of great dual-sided printing for her torso and some side-printing on her legs to show the shorts. She has bare arms and a brown ponytail headpiece which we&#39;ve seen many times before in past CMF Series. She also has a dual-sided facial print, one is smiling and ready to start, the other is determined covered in sweat as she&#39;s exerting herself in physical combat.</p>

<p>Extra accessories include an extra protective head piece and a cylinder piece to attach it to when not in use. Overall this one&#39;s not very bad, in fact she&#39;s pretty great, however I will note that she may not be one of the most sought after despite her parts being good for gym goers in LEGO City MOCs.</p>
