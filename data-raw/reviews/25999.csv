<p>The Scallywag Pirate features dual-molded legs with some nice white stripes printed over dark green leggings, or short pants, or whatever you&#39;d care to call them. His torso is dual-sided with the print, showing a bare chest covered by a ratty tattered looking blue vest and a brown belt to hold up his pants. An anchor tatoo is on the side of his arm. He&#39;s got the traditional looking eyepatch with scraggly beard on his face and features a brand new balte pate scalp piece with a red bandana tied around it.</p>

<p>For accessories he&#39;s got the ordinary looking Pirates sword and a treasure map which features a more recent print, possibly even brand new for this figure, it&#39;s so hard to tell when you&#39;ve seen so many different map prints over the years. Overall, while I love the detailing I&#39;d have to mildly recommend this one, Pirates just aren&#39;t everybody&#39;s cup of tea sadly and despite trying unique and different looks the CMF Pirates tend to get a little repetitive or uninspired. Next time can we get a brand new red coat or blue coat? It&#39;d be nice to see the heroes of LEGO Pirates show up in the CMF line.</p>

The X on the map is a suburban area west of the city - I wonder what treasure is buried there?</p>
