"KLOKRIECHER","2012-01-15T04:48:38.257Z","LEGO BIONICLE (Accessories) - Bionicle Master Builder Set Review","This is a very cool set to have and it's fun to play with as well. There're lot's of models you can build and each one is very easy to build. There're also no stickers in this set to worry about. The legs of this main model you can see on the front of the instruction can be moved and if you turn the tail on the back you're able to move the head up and down. The mouth can be opened and the arms can sviwel as well. As I told you in the beginning: It's a very cool set to have - even for pieces which you can use for future MOC's (My own creations and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
