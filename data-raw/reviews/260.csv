"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-27T20:56:46Z","Oh, boy! A camera!","This was my 2nd LEGO studios set. I love it! How could you not? No alternate models. That sucks. But, I do wish they would make more studios sets. THEY ROOL! (sorry about the spelling.) I also wish that there would be more studios crew members, with the names on the back of their shirt. More than just: DIRECTOR, ASSISTANT, GRIP, and CAMERA MAN. like, you know, like, TOUR GUIDE, or something like: PROPERTY MASTER, or, somthin' like, SECURITY GAURD, or, like, MEDIC. I have my own LEGO studio, and the MEDIC would come in handy, as my actors get hurt a lot. I would like a tour guide to give all the movie-fanatics a tour. LEGO Studios is great.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-31T21:53:27Z","yay!","my first Studios set, and it's a good one. Yeh get all these neat little parts for $4 Canadian! (My fave's the 1x4 danger stripe tile, comes in handy.) And it comes with a camerman, although I wish he was a gaffer (a lighting guy). ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2006-07-04T06:33:34Z","My first Studios set!","My first set, and one that truly is great! Studios is the perfect real-life theme, and with these sets is a fantasy that can come true. Even for such a small set, the pieces, design and minifig is great stuff! I also tried and loved the alternate building model of a crane camera, which was almost better than the actual set!

Good Set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"deluckybrick","2007-07-23T17:45:54.007Z","Affordable, classic!","This set is very well-priced and affordable for what you get.  The cameraman minifig is a creative one, and so is the camera.  I like how the lamp moves back an forth, along with the camera.  I think this set is definitely a classic of Lego Studios, and it is a must have for any town, movie set, brickfilm, ect,ect.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-08-22T00:44:14.083Z","Lights, Camera, Action","This is a small set (the smallest if I'm not mistaken) in the Studio series. It is a nice little series having lots of cool parts, vehicles, people and alot of playability in the sets. The series had a working camera that came with set 1349 but the camera is now quite old, cheap and of very poor quality, but still a nice addition. This particular set is a camera man.

The set itself is quite simple. Camera operator, camera and a light. But is it actually more than just this. The camera operator has a special body with movie ID on it, the face is different to most normal faces and quite nice to use. The camera isn't just a basic LEGO camera. The have added pieces to it to make it bigger and more complex also there is a tape that goes inside the camera removable from the back. 

The lights is pretty standard but it is nice and tall and both the light and camera are on the new style hinges  which are good for setting the light and camera in exact positions. Also the black and yellow check plate on the floor is quite usable.

Overall its a great little model and well deserves a 6/10. A nice addition to any town,  a good model for any collector and part of a good, interesting set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"rabk295","2008-07-19T06:35:30.513Z","I don't Know......","There is really nothing wrong with this set, but I gave it a three because I do not think that there is much you can do with this set unless you have a lot
of other studio sets (Which I don't). If you have other sets to use this set with, than it is probably a great set, but I have no use for it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"just2good","2009-05-30T10:57:44.483Z","Good Studios Starter (GSS)","This would be good to start any studios collection. It comes with a Cameraman (duh!) and a camera.

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T12:55:01.133Z","Lights, Camera, Action!","<p>Set #1357: Cameraman, an impulse set if ever I saw one, but a good impulse set. This set allows you to build a stationary camera for filming anything and everything in your LEGO display, not just your LEGO Studios theme. Pair it up with Stuntman Catapult (#1356) and you have the perfect tools for a little scene, with the cameraman, the director and the stuntman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or you can send your Cameraman and his little camera off to the world of LEGO City, where action abounds, and the news has to be told. (Anchorman or Achorwoman&nbsp;not included.) In LEGO Atlantis the Cameraman can film the expedition. (Underwater Breathing Accessories not included.) The big battle between the Imperials and the Pirates needs to be saved for posterity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is just the best for fuelling the imagination of its builders. There aren't that many pieces, but for what you get you get quite a lot of play value. (Even for the AOFL crowd, such as me, LOL.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can however see where you may be dissapointed in this set if it was the only Studios set you owned, but as pointed out above the Cameraman is a fun and great little set that can be used for anything and with any theme. All that's required is the imagination of the builder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall rating five, because this set is just that much fun, even if it is simple to build and uses a grand total of seventeen pieces.</p>",TRUE,5,3,2,4,3
