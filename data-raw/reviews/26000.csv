<br />
As we sat on the curb, sharing an oxygen tank so graciously provided by the fire department, I told my grateful new friend about my undying love of LEGO and penguins.<br />
<br />
That person had a connection I can no longer recall to TLG, and demanded that somehow, in honour of his boozy saviour, the next series have not one, nor one style, but two different variations on the excellence of penguinity.</p>

<p>It could have happened.</p>

<p>The truth is, I&#39;m not concerned how it happened, but somehow, in one series, I got a molded penguin, and this adorable penguin costume.<br />
<br />
I think the use of the&nbsp;Series 15 Shark Suit Guy&#39;s fins is pretty slick.<br />
<br />
Just look at those painted little toes! &nbsp;SQUEE!<br />
<br />
I love the costume minifigures, and having one as a little skating penguin has filled a hole I didn&#39;t even know I had.</p>

<p>Penguin Boy has very limited detailing, there&#39;s printing on the front of his torso for his white belly and some minor printing on his short legs for the toes of his penguin feet. In point of fact I believe this is a rare occurrence for the short legs, they rarely get printing.</p>

<p>His only accessories are the pair of skates he&#39;s wearing, perhaps this costumed animal child is performing in the Ice Capades?&nbsp; An awesome figure for certain, and a very nice re-use of the Chicken Suit torso, I&#39;m hopeful we&#39;ll see Flamingo, Peacock or Eagle/Falcon/Hawk Suit characters in future. Strongly recommended.</p>

"LegoHobbitFan","2018-11-29T20:23:32.243Z","Penguin Boy","<p>I am a huge penguin fan, so the CMF Series 16 Penguin Boy was a must-have for me. All 4 of his parts are unique to this figure. He has mini black legs, but they have a unique printing on the feet to represent a penguin&#39;s feet. His torso also has unique printing on it, as well as flippers instead of regular arms. These flippers sadly can not hold accesories, although they look great! His head has an adorable expression on It, and his helmet is shaped like a penguin&#39;s head, and has a hole through which his head can be seen. Since he cannot hold accesories, he comes&nbsp;with a pair of ice skates. CMF animal suit characters tend to gain value over time, making them a good investment, and the fact that so many of his pieces are unique also gives him&nbsp;value. It is a great minifigure, and I highly recommend it, wether for play, display, or value!</p>
