<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As all CMFs&nbsp;are,&nbsp;the Rogue is ensconced within a foil pack, that double edged sword of anticipation and frustration to which most&nbsp;readers of Brickset&nbsp;have surely&nbsp;been exposed to.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Rogue is fully equipped for roguish deeds of derring-do&nbsp;with a quiver and bow. The hood is perhaps the most striking part included, as it covers the mouth, unlike the ubiquitous hood found through out many collections.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Rogue is attired in a unique vest, sash, pouch, hood combination that looks quite classy. The legs are double molded to give the appearance of boots. The top of the left arm is red, perhaps in continuation of the cape, which is held by a wolf head brooch. The effect is indeed roguish.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a minifig. Pretty standard. No cloth capes to fiddle around with.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>See above; it&#39;s the minifig.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The Rogue is quite a delightful minifigure. You get a character that could be well suited to a more individual role, or that could be repeated, perhaps with some variations,&nbsp;to create a merry forest band.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finding the Rogue in the blind pack is&nbsp;simple; feel for the quiver or bow&nbsp;and use the one you didn&#39;t find first&nbsp;to confirm.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
I love the print on the torso, with the possible homage to The Wolf Pack (a theme sorely in need of reissue). &nbsp;The single dual molded arm, and opposite single glove are nice touches that speak to the asymmetrical nature of archery. &nbsp;Dual molded boots, which may be the new norm, are nice. &nbsp;I am totally in love with the hood piece. &nbsp;I might even go so far as to say it would be an improvement on any non-Ninjago ninja sets (you know, TLG, if you&#39;re listening).<br />
<br />
I kind of wish it came with a cape. &nbsp;I&#39;m sure one of the new, soft capes would work with a quiver on the back, but I&#39;m not sure that they were available when this series was released.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s an excellent army builder figure, and I hope that similarly outfitted figures are due out for future Castle sets.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-09-04T20:09:03.223Z","The Wolf Ninja?","<p><strong>Set #71013 Rogue:</strong> Not to be mistaken with the X-Man of the same name, this Rogue is taking cues from classic Castle Era villains/anti-heroes the Forest Men. As far as the colour scheme is concerned.</p>

<p>He&#39;s got dual-molded legs with brown boots and green pants, there&#39;s a lot of printed detailing on his legs and torso, in fact he has dual-sided printing on his torso in case you lose the quiver accessory. With a small beard and side-burns it is difficult to determine if this is meant to be a villain or not, but it is interesting that one of his arms is dual-molded and the torso print features a wolf head pin on the long scarf he&#39;s wearing. Perhaps a hint of the old Wolfpack Sub-Theme from Classic Castle.</p>

<p>The hood accessory with full covering face mask is a brand new piece, he&#39;s carrying an old bow accessory too. Overall this figure is one of the stand outs for me from LEGO CMF Series 16 and one you will definitely want to track down, possibly even aquire a bunch for a small army of new Wolf Pack team members. (Despite not being officially identified as a member of that unscrupulous group of Castle era villains.)</p>
