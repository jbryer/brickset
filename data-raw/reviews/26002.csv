<p>This character is a huge draw because of the little dog he&#39;s got, another new animal, with a cute little tongue sticking out print on his muzzle. The large trophy accessory has been used quite often before, here we have some printing on it with the image of the breed of dog, I think it&#39;s a Corgi or something to that affect. One of those small dogs that many people breed and adore.</p>

<p>A simple torso print with a standard suit jacket, tie and undershirt appearance for this character is included, he&#39;s got a doggie treat in one pocket and the first place ribbon on his jacket. He&#39;s happy to have won as he&#39;s smiling and his hair piece is a new sculpted piece in blonde.</p>

<p>Overall I recommend him as one of the ones to track down, especially for dog lovers who want more LEGO dog breeds to populate their LEGO City displays.</p>

<p>The dog show winner is a fun figure with one great accessory and another good one .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>His hair was newly introduced with this figure and was later used for the Lego batman movie Bruce Wayne and Cedric Digory , the head showcases a thrilled expression , the torso is a light blue suit with a first place badge and a dog biscuit and the legs are unprinted in the light tan colour .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>His accessories include a fun metal grey trophy with subtle printing and a newly introduced West island white mould which means a lot to me personally and is very nice . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this a nice figure with an accessory&nbsp; which means loads to me and has surprisingly not been reused and I recommend it , now just waiting for a border collie (sheep dog) mould to come out .</p>
