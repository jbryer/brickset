<p>Compared to Series 2, this Mariachi band member is using a brand new acoustic guitar piece to play music, and is sporting the LEGO mustache piece instead of a facial print. He&#39;s dressed all in black with a single sided torso print showing a big silver belt buckle in the shape of an eagle, a red tie/kerchief around his neck and a fancy silver highlighted jacket, the silver detailing is included on his large hat.</p>

<p>Overall this is a lazy re-use of a name for a second character that can become part of a proper Mariachi band, the first member in Series 2 had the maracas, this one brings the guitar to the set, here&#39;s hoping the third member will have a saxaphone. Definitely recommended for his parts and guitar.</p>

This&nbsp;minifigure is my favorite because it is introducing and exposing others to Mexican traditional and culture that they might not otherwise get. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The issue that I have with the CMS series is the cost per minifigure. I thought $3.99 was high, but now, they are costing $4.99. &nbsp;To me, this a negative. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this a great minifigure to owe.&nbsp;I have been trying to collect all the CMS minifigures that represent different cultures. &nbsp;</p>
