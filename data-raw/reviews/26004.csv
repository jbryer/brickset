I was kinda bummed at first the I didn&#39;t get one of the&nbsp; three I hoped for, (Rogue, Banana Guy, Hiker) but the spy grew on me. As you can see in the title above, he is actually Dash Justice from the Alpha Team video game and subsequent theme. Honestly, this is one the best callbacks Lego&rsquo;s ever done, at least in my opinion. It&rsquo;s always nice to see Lego acknowledge their past themes.&nbsp;Anyways, his prints are nicely detailed, his accessories fit the spy motif, and his face, goggles, and hair are great. The hair and goggles in particular are very cool, as the hair can attach any visor-like accessories to it, and the goggle piece are a very nice mold, and can find use on your other figures (such as power miners) when the spy isn&#39;t using them. The accessories do fit him well. I love the rope, because a spy needs a rope to hang from the wall to gather intel from those he is spying on. I know the gun is somewhat controversial, but this is a nice inclusion in my point of view, because a spy needs to defend himself if he is found by those he spies on. All in all, great figure, and you should hope to get this one if you pick up a bag or two!</p>

<p>Spy is dressed all in black, he&#39;s got a black jacket full of belts and pouches, a grey turtleneck is underneath it, he has more pouches and knee pads on his legs and there&#39;s a wrist device of sometime attached to his arm/printed on one side of his arm. His hair piece is brand new designed to accommodate the new night vision goggles that attach to his hair and cover up his facial print.</p>

<p>Speaking of which his facial print includes a microphone communicator on one side. The logo on his chest is an updated Alpha Team design. As far as accessories go he&#39;s borrowing a lot from past figures, he&#39;s got the rope from the Mountain Climber, a black parachute from the Skydiver and a pistol from... well LEGO Agents used them last as that type of accessory, it&#39;s also used in many droid builds for leg joints.</p>

<p>This is a great looking Minifigure and I&#39;m thrilled at the call back to LEGO Alpha Team on the torso print. I recommend this one as a must have from the series, multiples make for a great MOC army of updated Alpha Team members for your collection.</p>
