<p>Not much to discuss here, no prints on the legs or torso. He has double-molded arms for the short-sleeved look and his face has a big grinning smile with a pair of &#39;cool&#39; shades on it. The new sculpted suit piece is brand new and looks great, it too features limited printing with a Banana sticker on it.</p>

<p>Overall this dude is set for some fun, a shame he didn&#39;t include an accessory to hold like a banana piece, however I&#39;d suggest keeping this guy away from Gorilla Suit Guy, unless he wants to experience some unapeeling bad times. Heh... Strongly recommended.</p>
