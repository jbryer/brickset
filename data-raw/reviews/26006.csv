It&#39;s definitely one we want to see more of, but for now just get as many of her as you can find.</p>

<p>With dual-molded arms for a short-sleeve look and a double sided torso print this Minifigure has no other detailing, there&#39;s no printing for her legs. Her hair is the same as the Zombie Cheerleader, perhaps this is what she looked like before being bitten. Her accessory is of course a baby bottle and a LEGO Baby, yep she&#39;s got a little baby to take care of which means you get two minifigs for the price of one in this set.</p>

<p>I would strongly suggest buying multiples, while her shirt design is a bit goofy looking, the parts alone and the baby are definitley well worth the asking price for this pack.</p>

<p>The girl&#39;s hair is pretty nice though. I think it&#39;s exclusive.</p>
