"Upsidedown98","2016-07-30T22:06:32.003Z","Micro Y!","<p>The first Build Your Own Adventure LEGO book has just been released in stores and it comes with an exclusive &#39;Microfighter&#39; style Y-Wing Starfighter. Microfighters seem to divide opinion - some dislike the proportions though I have developed a soft spot for them over the last few years. My local ASDA Walmart has been good with the DK LEGO books recently and this continued the trend, being available at just &pound;8 (cover price is actually &pound;17.99). I grabbed a couple and headed home....</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The sturdy outer slipcase holds both the box containing the pieces and the Build Your Own Adventure book. Inside the box is a polybag with the LEGO pieces. There is no instruction leaflet within the bag as the instructions are actually contained within the book itself.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are mainly light grey with a splattering of yellow and white for the cockpit sections. Nothing extraordinary&nbsp;as is&nbsp;expected for small sets, though the minifigure does include a blaster.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Our hero minifigure is Zin, based on the standard rebel pilot figure. None of the parts appear to be new, and the figure is comprised of existing parts and prints (inlcuding Dack&#39;s helmet). As stated he comes with a small blaster pistol.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build itself is straightforward with clear instructions. Though not complicated, there is little repetition and so it comes together&nbsp;nice and&nbsp;quickly.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This isn&#39;t going to change people&#39;s opinions of the Microfighter range. Those that don&#39;t like the proportions will still dislike these, but for those that are fans this will be a desirable addition. Whilst obviously aimed at younger children, the book itself is also noteworthy in that it offers some ideas for further Microfighter builds including Podracers and Slave-1 as well as scenery&nbsp; and other assorted ships mini-builds. If you can find it at the discounted price that&nbsp;I did it&#39;s well worth adding to your collection.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A very interesting difference here. &nbsp;The model comes as part of a book set, and the instructions are the first pages of the book. &nbsp;It&#39;s not unique, but it&#39;s not that common, and my first such set.<br />
<br />
I have to say I&#39;d have rather had a separate instruction booklet, to keep with all my others.<br />
<br />
The entire book itself is a bunch of fun little build ideas, with simple illustrations to show the builds, and exploded diagrams, as opposed to step-by-step guides. &nbsp;They also show a lot of neat little building tricks and techniques that give readers a well-illustrated opportunity to explore new ideas.<br />
<br />
The &quot;Builder Talk&quot; pages (12 &amp; 13)&nbsp;are&nbsp;a pretty good summary of terminology, and would be excellent for beginning MOCers and new fans to start thinking and talking about their own models.</p>

<p>The &quot;Mission Launch&quot; pages (26 &amp; 27) even show you the necessary details to build the landing pad that is printed on the back of the insert bill of materials.</p>

<p>The builds in the book are often fun and quirky - and some are wonderfully simple, such as the portable heater on page 31.</p>

<p><br />
The black and white bag was actually slightly more than I was expecting. &nbsp;I thought it would be just a clear plastic, but instead it had actual information on it in the traditional font and layout. &nbsp;No picture, like a polybag set, but not exactly just a numbered sub-assembly bag, either.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not a lot of parts (73), but what is there is, I feel, used wisely. &nbsp;About five extra little parts as well.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The pilot minifigure, Zin,&nbsp;is nothing groundbreaking, but who doesn&#39;t want more rebel pilots? &nbsp;He&#39;s got a dual sided face, on one side confidently cocky, on the other... preparing for a crash? &nbsp;His legs and entire torso (front and back) have rich printed details. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I&#39;m not so thorough a LEGO Star Wars fan to say whether or not the printing is unique - and I only have a couple of rebel pilots in storage to compare him against. &nbsp;I suspect he&#39;s pretty much the same as the X-Wing Pilot from the MicroFighters line (and others)&nbsp; But all that said, he looks great, even if his helmet is a little generic.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build itself uses fairly simple techniques, and (I&#39;m certain) easily obtainable parts should you miss the opportunity to get this in the shops.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>This is where the model really shines, in its completion. &nbsp;73 parts were used to make probably the best looking Y-Wing Starfighter yet. &nbsp;It&#39;s got delightful greeblyness in a judicious use of a few common parts. &nbsp;It hits the chibi scale perfectly - being compactly cute, while retaining instant recognition, and with no distracting misses.</p>

<p>Compare it to 75075, the MicroFighter AT-AT. &nbsp;The Y-Wing is a beautiful homage to its film counterpart. &nbsp;The AT-AT is awful. &nbsp;It looks like how AT-ATs might change over time, as later models are released by the First Order or the remnants of the Empire. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t look very much like the lumbering death dogs of the Battle of Hoth.<br />
<br />
Had this been released as one of the MicroFighter boxed sets, it would probably have been the star of its series. &nbsp;Only the X-Wings and Snow Speeder are as good.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I wanted this model as soon as I saw the first image of it, here on Brickset. &nbsp;It went into my Costco shopping cart the first time I laid eyes on it. &nbsp;The pictures looked good, but they didn&#39;t do the model justice. &nbsp;It&#39;s a great set that hits the chibi&nbsp;approach more accurately than a skilled T-16 pilot picks off a womp rat.<br />
<br />
The book is fun, especially for younger or newer builders who want to start exploring beyond the cannon set instructions and become full-fledged MOC builders.<br />
Don&#39;t dither. &nbsp;Buy this book set.</p>

As I noted in the DC Super Heroes release this Build Your Own Adventure style of DK Books took over from the original Brickmaster books and improved greatly on the formula, or if I forgot to mention that then here it is being stated for the first time. I feel that the design of these books is a vast improvement to Brickmaster and here&rsquo;s why.</span></span></span></span></p>

There&rsquo;s a separate tray to store the Polybag included with this book, the pages are very nicely put together and everything works so much better compared to the Brickmaster style of book that had the front cover being way too large and making turning the pages to build the models rather problematic.</span></span></span></span></p>

He&rsquo;s a good addition to the Rebel Pilots Minifigures we&rsquo;ve seen over the year and a LEGO exclusive character similar to those found in the LEGO Freemaker inspired sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Contents</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

The Master Builder selected to make these models has done a great job. You get to see a lot of techniques that you can copy with your collection inspiring you to build your own creations.</span></span></span></span></p>

Brickmaster had some nice ideas, but Build Your Own Adventure seems to give more to see and do, I&rsquo;m still scratching my head at some of the terms used in the book for parts that doesn&rsquo;t quite match up with what I thought AFOLS used for names of parts.</span></span></span></span></p>

The biggest draw for me is the MicroFighter Scaled Y-Wing model being available with slightly altered build compared to the Series 3 release, which will be discussed in the Polybag review. Everything about this newer series of LEGO DK products is a vast improvement to the older BrickMaster model. You get more to read and see, more insight into building your own models with parts from your own collections and you are given some fun material to follow along with. I would strongly recommend getting these over the Brickmaster books if you&rsquo;re looking for some LEGO Books with pieces to explore.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Billbuilds","2022-05-16T08:40:08.847Z","the ""original"" y-wing microfighter","<p>I remember buying this set not long after I&nbsp;first saw it on shelves, and I&nbsp;must say that this set is very fun. i imagine that afols will not enjoy it as much as I&nbsp;did when I&nbsp;was younger, but this is the perfect gift for a kfol. the build is basically just the y-wing microfighter from 2017 - except this set came out in 2016 so the 2017 set is just a clone of this set, with flick fire missiles added and a different pilot. The book is where&nbsp; think this set really shines though. it features a rather simple story where the included minifig, named zin&nbsp;evalon, is touring the galaxy looking for holocrons.instead of featuring art for the pictures, it features lego models&nbsp;built by rod Gilles, along with help by the lego star wars set designers. The book starts out showing interior sections of home one, then the second chapter has zin&nbsp;visit hoth, where the empire is currently using echo base. zin then visits tatooine, where he enters his y-wing into a podrace (the judges said a y-wing counts as a podrace because of the pod shaped engines. he then visits cloud city, which has been taken over by the empire. he rescues lobot, who boba fet has captured, and he then goes to vendor, where the imperial occupation of the planet has just begun. after finding holocrons on each planet, he returns to echo base to give them to admiral Ackbar, concluding the story.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, i would recommend this set due to the book being a lot of fun, but if you only want the lego model then you should buy the 2017 microfighter set instead.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thankyou for reading my review.</p>
