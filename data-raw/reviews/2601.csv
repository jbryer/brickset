"AddictedToStyrene","2007-09-26T07:34:00.89Z","Simple gadget","A simple little kit. I have never done anything with it other than use the small range of parts it came with to play with for a short while and forget. The main part is a watch battery powered gadget with an low friction axle hole where the two wheels are in the picture (left hand side as we are looking at it.) It wouldn't be hard to fit this to any Lego technic set or large enough vehicle and see how fast and how far you can push it across the carpet. The question is, why would you want to?
This might appeal to very technical minded builders, such as the Mindstorms crowd - although there is no way of outputting the information other than reading it off the little LCD screen. I bought it because it was shiny, and there is a nice little selection of technic pieces with it, but I have no real use for it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Its like a Mindstorms RCX computer brick except that this one does not execute pre-controlled orders and just measures its own speed, and distance.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4>
<p>The box is quite small, but that's because there are not many parts in the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The instructions are very clear. You can make a three-wheeled (small) vehicle with it.</p>
<p>There is also a&nbsp;1-paper leaflet with all kind of sets from the year 2000.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>As said before there are not many parts in this set, because this set is mainly for the speed computer and not for the parts, so the only interesting part is the speed computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build of the three-wheeled vehicle is very, very simple. It's more a demonstration on how to use the speed computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>There is not much to tell about the three-wheeled vehicle, so I tell something about the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer can measure the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speed (km/h or mph) 
<li>Time (in minutes and seconds) 
<li>Distance (in meter or feet)</li></ul>
<p>That's all very usefull for Technic builders (and even more; just fun to know how fast your new lego car is). When you use the computer for the first time, it can be a bit tricky to understand the controls (it has&nbsp;2 buttons), but when you're used to it, it's very easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe you're thinking ""but, to know the speed and distance, you need to know the wheel diameter?"". Yes, so you need to enter this information into the computer when you're using a new wheel (it remembers you last wheel). You need to fill in&nbsp;the diameter of the wheel&nbsp;in bricks and plates. So, a wheel can be, for example,&nbsp;4 bricks and 2 plates high.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ""meter"" attached to the computer is quite small, that's very usefull for smaller cars. It can be attached using the brick connection on top or on the bottom, or using the 3 pinholes in the middle. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A drawback of this set is that it has a very short wire.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>This is a really good set. Actually it isn't really a ""set, but still very good. It can be attached very easily and is, after some practice, very easy to use. It's a very good value for money too. </p>",TRUE,5,5,2,4,5
