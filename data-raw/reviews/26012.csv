Is this book worth picking up for AFOLs though? Well hopefully this review will help determine that.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>This title is very expressive and looks great from a visual standing. The front cover is loaded with characters from across the LEGO Star Wars universe, with a strong emphasis on Force users. The back cover is dedicated to the First Order with a large writing detailing what to expect from this book.</p>

<p>The interior is impressive enough as well with a lot of large colourful images of LEGO Star Wars characters, sets and other elements, overall a pretty standard appearance to other DK LEGO books. The number of pages is 96, just shy of a hundred, which I&rsquo;ll admit is a bit less than we expect from most LEGO DK books, at 20.99$ in Canada that really has you pause and contemplate what you&rsquo;re getting here. And what do you get?</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Unkar&rsquo;s Brute: As Minifigures go this one is a tad underwhelming, mostly due to the choice in characters. For a book dedicated primarily to the Force and Force users, not receiving a Jedi or Sith of any kind is unfortunate.</p>

<p>The detailing is still very up to par on this figure though, his double-sided torso print includes a tattered looking shirt and jacket (with a hood on the back) and the head has printing on the back to show off what I assume is the protective covering he&rsquo;s wearing to keep the sun off his skin, he has a single visible eye. Overall not a bad looking figure, just an unfortunate and weak choice for the figure to include with this book because I don&rsquo;t envision him as being high demand.</p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>

<p>The contents of the book are summaries of the Star Wars Saga, information on certain key characters from the saga with Force Facts, information that can be found elsewhere if you looked up Wookiepedia concerning planets, ships and other elements, however this is all presented in a LEGO fashion with fun images to excite readers. A fairly good use of the older Planets pieces are showcased here across two pages that explains every planet LEGO made before the cancelation of Planet sets.</p>

<p>The book is mostly a companion for LEGO Star Wars The Force Awakens, it&rsquo;s telling you everything leading up to the newest installment and includes some key information surrounding that seventh film. Even Rebels gets a few pages dedicated to it, and you&rsquo;ll also find large blurbs/dialogue boxes with quotes from all seven movies. Overall it&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;d expect from a book of this size and scale.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Everything in this book is fairly easy to come by via online web pages, the same could be said of many of the other DK LEGO Books, it is still fun to have a shelf full of books of this sort though even if the content isn&rsquo;t terribly unique. The Minifigure included with the book however is a tad weaker compared to other interesting prints and characters from past books. A generic thug from Jakku isn&rsquo;t exactly a huge demand character.</p>

<p>Younger fans of LEGO Star Wars will get a kick out of reading this, AFOLs might enjoy some of the material as well, especially the stunning visuals used with Minifigures and sets to showcase the LEGO Star Wars universe. The book focuses heavily on Force users, so you won&rsquo;t find many other characters aside from the newest Force Awakens ones. I&rsquo;d recommend this for the younger readers strongly, AFOLS, I&rsquo;d suggest picking this up if you really want it, however it can be easily skipped without any issues. Try to find it at Costco though, the half-price is much better than full price for what you&rsquo;re getting, especially as there are no bricks for building here.</p>
