"Odeinoichus","2016-11-16T18:24:33.803Z","Brilliant Update for Ninjago Fans","<p><strong>LEGO Ninjago Character Encyclopedia Updated and Expanded Edition:</strong> Once again DK updates a book that was desperately in need of an update as four years have passed since the original printing of the first Ninjago Character Encyclopedia which only covered Season&rsquo;s One and Two. And this book is a nice upgrade.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>The book has changed very little from the presentation that was discussed in the first version. The biggest changes here are the new pictures on the front and back cover and the overall design of the cover when it comes to the Minifigure window, the original book had a large circular window to view the exclusive figure, this time you get a rectangular window showing off Jay and his unique accessories.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Stone Warrior Jay: Dressed in a new outfit, this is a variant of Jay that is a nice addition to the collection for fans of Ninajgo. His print is very detailed with belts and pieces of armor plating everywhere on his double-sided torso, and knee pads and a visible belt sash for his leg printing.</p>

<p>He includes the standard facial expression for Jay, on a double-sided face, with a worried expression on one side and a determined one on the other. He&rsquo;s got the lower mask piece in blue, a hair piece in light brown and the older shoulder armor piece with twin katana in the scabbards.</p>

<p>The best accessory for Jay is the printed tile with StarFarer #329&rsquo;s cover printed on it, a great little accessory and the first official LEGO comic book printed on a LEGO piece. Definitely a great figure from LEGO.</p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>

<p>This book has been beefed up with a good fifty more pages compared to the original, all of the pages from the first version are presented here for Season&rsquo;s One and Two, but now Season Three, Four, Five and Six have been added, that is a lot more content with a lot more pages of Ninja, Stone Army, Anacondrai Warriors, Sky Pirates and Evil Ghosts. There&rsquo;s a lot more to read about and the set gallery has been preserved, there&rsquo;s also some brief interviews with members of the LEGO Ninjago design staff. What has not been brought over unfortunately is the Minifigure Gallery page, instead of giving a few brand new pages to expand on what was presented in the original Character Encyclopedia DK for whatever reason removed the Minifigure gallery as seen before. Perhaps this is because the entire book has pictures of the Minifigures, however it would have been nice to keep this feature and showcase every Minifigure from Season One through Six.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Despite the loss of a key feature from the original Character Encyclopedia this book is a lot thicker and offers up far more to read compared to the original. You get a host of brand new pages with tons of information on the character, the season they come from, and even the sets you&rsquo;ll find them in. A few errors carry over, there are some sets which are given incorrect numbers when listing who is found in each set for the Minifigures info pages. Still it&rsquo;s a great looking book and loaded with tons of information. It&rsquo;s also a fun read and quite colorful, I&rsquo;d recommend this one over the original honestly as it is more complete.</p>
