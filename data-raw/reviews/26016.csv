I eventually got it and the wait was worth it. 215 pieces is great and reasonable for this set. The parts were cool, and unique. As for playability, it&#39;s okay but the only features that you can really do are shake it to make the white snow pieces move around and slide the thingamadoohickey house in and out. Value for money is also okay but in order to get it off of some site that isn&#39;t the LEGO shopping site, beware ridiculous prices.</p>

<p>Great set overall, I would recommend this.</p>

<p>The build is pretty straightforward and quick, the only complication might be connected with the alignment of some 1x1s because if you are a pedantic builder (as I am), any misalignment cannot be tolerated. Building is slightly repetitive because we have three identical sides but it is still enjoyable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You get a nice assortment of relatively uncommon parts, like the dark red mason bricks, or the transparent round wall pieces as well as the unique transparent dish piece. Also quite many spare parts (mostly 1x1s), which is always appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One Santa minifig is included, however not exclusive.</p>

<p>The snow globe doesn&#39;t really work like a regular snow globe (and it&#39;s not even a globe, rather a cylinder), however, this doesn&#39;t diminish the joy of displaying the piece in your Christmas themed collection. It&#39;s not a play set and trying to get Santa out is not the best&nbsp;idea.&nbsp;Nevertheless, the set&nbsp;contains a hidden feature, which is a nice surprise and might turn&nbsp;it into a lovely gift box (obviously for smaller gifts).</p>

<p>Among all the questionable holiday sets we have seen this year, this one really stands out. If you get it for yourself or as a gift for your loved ones, you won&#39;t be disappointed. &nbsp;</p>

"HarleyMeenen","2017-01-23T00:25:34.89Z","The Talk of the Office","<p>There really is not much to say about the building of this set; it is quick, small, and easy without any surprises.</p>

<p>The end result, however, is just about perfect. It&#39;s nothing super special, nothing unexpected. But it does manage to be both cute and functional. The bottom is a small drawer, while the top forms the &quot;snowglobe,&quot; complete with lego snowflakes. I placed mine on my desk where it makes me smile, and my coworkers are always impressed that it can be shaken up just like a real snowglobe.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the biggest, best, or most impressive set. But if you&#39;re looking for something small, fun, and festive, I could not recommend this more highly.</p>

"lentil","2017-01-03T20:27:20.757Z","Extra Nice for a promotional item!","<p>This is certainly the nicest free item I&#39;ve received to date from a Lego.com purchase. It makes a stylish and festive display piece with a bit of added functionality to boot. I think the design works very well overall: the abundance of dark red mason bricks, in particular, is lovely, and the red-white-green and gold candy cane like columns are quite cute. I generally adore the dark green color, and the window frames here look handsome with their gold lattices inside. The tree is a relatively large and substantial, and Santa looks cheery.</p>

<p>Cons for me: maybe it&#39;s just the way I built it, but the drawer for me is difficult to maneuver in and out. The top of it gets stuck on the bottom of the white plate every time on opening, and you need to wiggle it to get it unstuck. Rather annoying. Also, the inside of the drawer is bright yellow, which imho clashes with the rest of the color scheme. Of course the yellow parts are&nbsp; hidden when the drawer is closed, but it would have been nicer looking if the drawer was styled consistently with the rest of the set. Finally, the presents at the base of the tree are so small that they don&#39;t do much for me, especially the orange and light blue ones which just don&#39;t look Christmas-y at all.</p>

<p>For a free set of this quality though one can hardly complain, and this is really a unique and original idea - kudos to LEGO!</p>
