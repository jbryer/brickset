<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This is a simple, tear tab, thin cardboard box with the typical Lego City art style, nothing new here. &nbsp;It comes with one small sheet of three stickers and two bags plus one set of instructions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Other than the nice selection of fairly unique minifigure torsos, the only remarkable pieces are the trans blue wind screen, three mailbox/cabinet pieces (two in yellow one in red with matching doors), 3 printed letters 1x2 white tiles and two red two-wheeler dollies. &nbsp;You also get two white light saber handles plus one spare.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I buy these starter sets mainly for the minifigures. &nbsp;At $10, often less on sale, you get four usually fairly diverse minifigures plus some accessories and a small build. &nbsp;This set certainly fits that design, and if anything, has an even better selection of minifigures than most of the other city starter sets. &nbsp;You end up with a pilot with nice red torso with detailed print including straps, plain black legs and a head with sunglasses and red helmet. &nbsp;You also get a female airmail worker also in a red torso with zip up coat and the airmail logo, black legs and auburn hair, single sided face print only. &nbsp;You also get two ground crew members, both in a nice light blue color, one with an orange safety vest, safety glasses and an orange hat (no molded in or separate ear protection), the other in an Octan branded jump suit with goatee and standard blue hat. &nbsp;For accessories they have two hand trucks, a wrench and a set of white light saber handles with red trans tips for marshaling batons. &nbsp;Cargo for the hand trucks is an Octan colored fuel container and a stack of three printed letters.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The main build is the helicopter which is a very mediocre build in my opinion. &nbsp;Having said that, considering this set is only $10 and has four minifigures, this doesnt surprise me and the set is still an awesome value. &nbsp;The helicopter has a printed control panel, no actual sticks or other physical controls (which is awkward looking), has brick built skids instead of the one piece ones we have seen in a number of small helicopter builds lately and has integrated mail compartments on either side of the rear fuselage. &nbsp;For the set, I think the build is perfectly adequate, but looking at it, it just seems odd and bland and I feel a couple small additions could dramatically&nbsp;improve the look and feel. &nbsp;You also get a very simple mailbox in red on a 4x4 green grass plate. &nbsp;This adds a nice little play feature. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>In the end, you get a lot for your money. &nbsp;I love the minifigures, they fall into two themed categories, the ground crew in their nice light blue jump suits and the airmail employee/pilot in their red outfits. &nbsp;But while the figs have their color themes, there is a ton of variety between each figure, making for some awesome torso designs. &nbsp;The accessories are great and the helicopter brings them all together from a play and display standpoint even if the actual model is the weakest link in the set.&nbsp;</p>

"SlovenianBrick","2016-08-20T17:12:08.183Z","60100-1 Airport Starter Set","<p>Hello everyone SlovenianBrick&nbsp;here with&nbsp;another review.</p>

<p>Today will be reviewing LEGO City set 60100-1 Airport Starter set.</p>

<h3><img src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/small/60100-1.jpg"" /></h3>

<h3>We get a small box like every starter set from LEGO City.</h3>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>So there are 81 pcs in the set and I think that is the really easy to build.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>There are 4 minifigures in the set: pilot, mechanic, ground crew guy and mailwoman.So minifigures are good for small set like this.</p>

<h3>So there are two bags and one instruction booklet.Let&#39;s build.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This set is good with minifgures and all aditions&nbsp;but the helicopter is a bad work.I hope that LEGO will be making a better version of small helicopters in the future.So that&#39;s it for this review.Our next reviews will be LEGO Disney Rapunzels Best Day Ever, LEGO Disney Minifigures and more.See ou later your SlovenianBrick.</p>

"Brickchap","2016-10-11T07:10:33.02Z","Postly Good","<p><img class=""mainimg"" src=""http://images.brickset.com/sets/small/60100-1.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Before images of Airport Starter Set were released, I expected and hoped for a set with some passengers and maybe a ground worker and pilot, with an Airport tug as a side build. I was very wrong in my guess. The last thing I expected was an Air Mail related set , let alone with a mail helicopter. Due to the deal of 4 minifigures plus a small build for $15, in my opinion, all City Starter sets are instantly good. Airport Starter Set remains as good (I will elaborate on why) because it is not very good, nor is it bad.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box is the average Starter set size. Starter set is written on the bottom right hand side corner and the box art shows the helicopter landing. There is one instruction booklet, the instructions are very easy to follow (Starter sets are about the easiest City sets to build)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>While most of the parts in this set are very common and boring, there are some exclusive and interesting pieces; there is the commonly used helicopter windshield piece, two 1x4x2 upside down sloped pieces in yellow (exclusive to this set ) and two yellow mailboxes. (also exclusive to this set).</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The main part of all Starter sets is the minifigures. As usual, there are 4 minifigures; a&nbsp; post woman, mail helicopter pilot, ground worker and Octan worker. The post woman uses the same postal torso print from 2008, I would have expected a new print as they have updated old prints in lots of other sets. She has short orangeish hair, which is fairly uncommon. Her face print is very common. The helicopter pilot uses a more recent torso print (commonly used for pilots) and his face print includes sunglasses (also commonly used for pilots), the ground worker reuses the 2015 Space worker print and wears a slightly uncommon orange cap. His also wears sunglasses (probably polarized ones) and comes with two marshaling wands. The Octan worker uses a new 2016 Octan print and wears a blue cap (the same mold as the ground worker&#39;s cap). His goatee face print is very common. The minifigures are very basic, and thus disappointing, but they are good choices of all rounded minifigures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is easy, enjoyable and quick. There are only three stickers, which are not too bad and the minifigures could easily be built by some 4 year olds.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When built, you are left with the 4 minifigures (covered in the Minifigures section) a post box, 2 trolleys, a fuel tank and a mail helicopter.</p>

<p>The two trolleys are just a whole mold and wheels. They are the most basic things Lego could include in a set, but are good inclusions (I`m very happy at the inclusion of two, rather then just one).</p>

<p>The fuel tank uses the Octan colours and can be transported on one of the trolleys.</p>

<p>The mailbox is very plain. It is a common red mailbox with a stand. The designers should definitely have included a 2x2 tile to cover the studs that are visible on top. (the lack of a red tile is just plain laziness on the designers behalf)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mail helicopter is the largest build. Although a very odd idea, postal helicopters do exist, although they were more common during the late 1940&#39;s. The yellow (and a little bit red) colour scheme is fine and is the recognized colours of the Lego City Postal Service.</p>

<p>Many fans of Lego, AFOLs especially, heavily criticize this style of small helicopter, but I think they have their place. The now very common windshield piece results in many of these type of helicopters looking very similar and limits how the designers can make each helicopter different. In this set, I think that this style is perfect, it allows the designers to provide the consumer with a reasonable sized aircraft, with the least amount of pieces.</p>

<p>There are two compartments (two mailboxes) which is where the included letters are stored. Although the real life post helicopters are bigger, there does not need to be much more space for mail, other wise it would become a cargo helicopter and increase the price.</p>

<p>The cockpit seats one minifigure and has an extremely common 1x2 tile print as the controls. There is some detail of an engine. The tail is probably too small but the rotors and back wing are fine. The only negative is the landing skids. They are what you would expect in a Lego Classic box as a suggested build. You could argue that they give more building experience (not really) but I do understand why the designers did not use the regular landing skid mold as it would be too big to fit in the box and would not look right compared to the helicopter.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Airport Starter Set is a good set for its size. The Starter Set deal is great, although the minifigures in this set were not as good as usual. The included smaller builds are very basic and the helicopter is fine. It is not perfect, but it is alright. As a complement to a larger Airport set or as an expansion for your Lego airport, it is very good. I do not believe it is the best ambassador for the 2016 Airport line, there are a lot of better sets in this line, and for playability, I think a child is better off saving up more money (perhaps for Cargo Plane or VIP service) rather then spending it on this set. AFOLs might be interested in the exclusive parts or useful minifigures, but that is it.</p>

"BlueGalaxy47","2017-05-24T21:11:54.877Z","Nice Set","<p>In this set, I like the main build of the helicopter as it is simple but stricking. I feel like the colour scheme is useful and that the stickers are vital to give the look that it is a mail helicopter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The post box is not done in very much detail, so I would recommend more parts being spent on it.</p>

<p>The minifigures and accessories are great. They suit the figures appropriately and look they look very nice as well.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a cool set with a lot of play opportunities and a lot of fun to be had.</p>

<p>The only improvement that could be made is to make the post box more interesting and less plain.</p>
