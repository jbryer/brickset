<p>The design of the plane&#39;s exterior is pretty cool -- the only issue I had was with the green accents on the wingtips, and that&#39;s because they felt like they were afterthoughts. &nbsp;As far as the interior goes, it&#39;s much like a real cargo plane, which is to say &quot;very empty.&quot; &nbsp;There&#39;s a bunch of space for cargo, but the real fault in the design is that there&#39;s no easy way to get access to that space. &nbsp;The tail boom folds up and the back door opens, but the amount of access via the back door isn&#39;t great.</p>

<p>The parts set is pretty useful, though, and if you were feeling saucy you could use it as the basis for a much larger cargo plane of your own design.</p>

<p>My kid loves it, though, and has spent most of the morning flying it around, and picking up and dropping off cargo.</p>

<p>Good value for the price if you&#39;re after it for more parts or if it&#39;s a gift for a kid.</p>

"BlueGalaxy47","2017-05-26T17:26:03.14Z","Nice Set","<p>The build of the place is really nice. I like the green colour&nbsp;of the plane along with the white which makes the colours flow well.</p>

<p>The engines are done really well as they look aggressive and make the plane look more like a cargo plane.</p>

<p>I like how you can adjust the angle of the tail, and I also like the opening back compartment.</p>

<p>The stickers are used to good effect, but I feel like they don&#39;t add enough stickers as they could have done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ground vehicle looks good to me, but I do wish they add a bit more parts on it to really give it more detail.</p>

<p>The cargo pieces look really really good as they are unique.</p>

<p>I love the pilot minifigure&nbsp;as his torso has a lot of detail and it looks professional. On the other hand, the airport service worker&#39;s torso is very very common and generic and is used in all of the other 2016 Lego city airport sets.</p>

<p>Overall, I love this set because the plane looks good, the playability is amazing and it is a nice addition to a Lego collection.</p>

<p>I wish that they change the torso of the airport service worker, add more stickers and add more detail to the ground vehicle!</p>

<p>Nice set though!</p>

<p>The build itself was straightforward, but really, really enjoyable. A lot of simple techniques but a few things surprised me about on the way.</p>

<p>In terms of parts a couple of special parts like the nose cone, box trolley and engines. The selection of parts were predominately green and white, with a selection of yellow an red for the cart.</p>

<p>Bag 1 and manual 1 build the plane (yes, it&#39;s a small set with multiple manuals). Bag 2 and manual 2 are the trolley car. There was the usual sticker sheet with 12 or so stickers that mostly went on really easily - I&#39;d recommend watching some of the online videos to help you get the most from this as it&#39;s so frustrating if you get it wrong, and we want your model looking great!</p>

<p>As the model came together, I found it was such a delight. Starting with how well it rolls around and the front wheel swivels freely to give the plane good mobility on the ground. Inside the engines, they have fans that spin when blown.</p>

<p>Round the back the cargo hatch opens and closes. But, one thing that really surprised me was the way the tail lifted to give more access. You can see in my photos how much this added to the playability and fun of the set. It was such a small details but made a big difference to the playability and usability of the set.</p>

<p>The figures were nice with a plane captain and ground worker. And enough boxes to make loading and unloading seem worthwhile.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend this set to anyone! And it&#39;ll look right at home in anyone&#39;s LEGO City!</p>
