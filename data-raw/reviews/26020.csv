<p>When I first heard of this set I was very excited. I had been wanting a Lego learjet and this set also included some other cool things that I wanted. VIP Service, in my opinion, would have been a perfect set, if it had not been for a small but very catastrophic flaw.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is the average $30/$40 box size. It shows the jet swooping very dangerously low on the limousine and airport tug. There are 3 instruction books, which are easy to follow, but require some common sense in some parts. (sometimes the order of which you build things can be made a lot easier by changing the order)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p><em>Interesting/exclusive parts:</em> There is the medium large exclusive black tail and the exclusive black specialized plane back fuselage piece. The engines in black are exclusive and so is the bottom black part of the cockpit section. There are thr two large white wings and the pretty rare black Inv. Roof 2X6 45 Deg. W/Cut piece.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are 3 minifigures in this set. There is a ground worker, pilot, chauffeur and businesswoman. The ground worker reuses the 2015 Space worker torso and has a common red construction hat. He has the very very common &#39;jangbricks&#39; face print. The pilot uses the regular pilot torso and a now common face print with aviator sunglasses. The chauffeur uses a very common torso print and the black police cap (the pilot uses this hat also) but uses a fairly uncommon face print with the beard being coloured black, rather then dark brown. The businesswoman uses a pretty rare torso print and has some fairly uncommon orangeish long hair. Her face print is very common. She comes with a fairly uncommon black laptop and a mobile phone (printed 1x2 tile) which is starting to become common. The worker is very plain and is basically the same as all the other 2016 airport ground workers, the pilot and chauffeur are also plain, the businesswoman is probably the best minifigure, after all she is the VIP, so she should be the best one. I am very happy at the inclusion of 4 minifigures, which is much better value then the usual 3 or 2.<!--StartFragment--></p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is enjoyable and fairly quick. The included models are built in an order from easiest to least easiest (you could not call the plane hard to build). As I said in the instructions section, sometimes you need to make the build simpler for yourself. Otherwise the build is fine.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When built, you are left with an airport tug, a limousine and a private jet.</p>

<p>The tug is the usual yellow and has the usual Follow Me sign. There is clips for a walkie-talkie on one side and a stick with an orange light on the other. The back has all red lights and there is room for one minifigure. There are 4 stickers.</p>

<p>The limousine is white and is fairly similar to the limousine included in Helicopter &amp; Limousine. It is built out of two Speed Champions chassis connected together. It uses the newer (much better) wheels. There are four doors and room for 2 minifigures. (The driver and passenger) There is room in the back for luggage and there is a screen showing a financial line graph, which hides a freezer with some icy poles. The roof of the limo is removable in two parts, the regular car roof for the drivers compartment and another large section.There is a red brake light in the roof at the back and two orange lights on the side at the front.(probably indicators) I am very happy with the limousine and it is a big improvement from the 2010 one. The only improvement could be room for another passenger.</p>

<p>The private jet is great but is where the flaw is. To help your curiosity, I will reveal it. The problem is... there is room for 3 passengers but only 1 will fit. With the roof off, 3 minifigures can fit comfortably, but only 1 will fit in the middle seat when the roof is replaced. Their heads/hair, just won&#39;t fit. The ony way around this is too lean the figure forward 100%, then it sometimes fits. There are no seats, only bars as seats. There is a television screen at the back with a croissant, champagne and room for luggage. There is a screen at the front showing the planes location and destination, with a possible map of the land around Lego City. There is also a table in the middle. The cockpit only has a 2x2 printed sloped tile for controls. Unlike in the passenger compartment, the pilot has a proper seat.&nbsp; The roof removes in 3 parts, the large specialized cockpit piece, then two smaller sections of the passenger compartment. The engines are mounted sideways at the back f the plane and the front wheels can turn 360 degrees. The main color scheme is black and white, although there is a dark tan line above the windows. There are 6 stickers, the ones on the tail say VIP in golden lettering and the other stickers provide the aircraft&#39;s identification number and allow a clean conversion from black to white. The wings are very strong, the whole build is very strong, but still light. The back ailerons are probably too small. The VIP plane is great, except for the seating.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>VIP Service is a great set. It is great value for $40 (or $30) and has a reasonable amount of minifigures. There is lots of detail and not too many stickers. I am very very happy with this set and think it is one of the best of the 2016 Airport line, if not one of the best 2016 City sets. There is lots of playability to be enjoyed and I definitely recommend it.</p>
