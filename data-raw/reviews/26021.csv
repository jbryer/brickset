<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This set comes in a big box that are mostly used for sets from 500 to 600 pcs.It is aged 6-12 and it has 670 pcs including 6 minifigures, 3 planes,hangar and little ground control car and tools.It also has a brick seperator included.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>670 parts is enough for this kind of set.It looks like it has about 750 parts, but no only 670.There are not any new pcs in the set, but a bunch of red, black, white, orange and gray pcs.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>There are totaly 6 minifigures included in the set: 2 jet pilots, stunt &nbsp;plane pilot, stunt and 2 ground workers.And those new prints on the jet pilots helmets are pretty cool.Minifigures are having some tools for fixing the planes.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>When you open the box you get: 5 instruction booklets, 1 sticker sheet, bags number: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and one bag full of plates.Let&#39;s start building.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Alright the build is done.The little service car is nice, specially the FOLLOW ME sign.Tools are nice.The stunt plane can fit one minifigure in the cockpit, but one can be on standing on the top of the plane.It has nice colours and it is the classical old plane.As for the jets there are good.Cockpit in each plane can fit one minifigure.Engines and outlets are fine.Wings and tails are cool and I&#39;m glad that they are having landing gears It is not like on the 2015 set 60078 Utility Shuttle.What that set didn&#39;t had landing gears.But these jets are more cooler.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<p>At the end I think that this is pretty cool set.Price is good, playing with this set is feels nice.So that will be all for the first review of the SlovenianBrick.More reviews on the way.See you soon. :)</p>

<p>When images of Airport Air Show were first released, I was amazed by the fact that it included 3 planes and a hangar. I had always wanted a Lego airport hangar and I could only recall 1 old Airport set which included 3 planes (which only had two planes and a tiny helicopter). It was a must-have for me and I believe a must-have for you if you like Lego planes, Lego City or a great bargain.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is quite large and very thick; it is almost the size of a Creator Expert box. The box art shows the two red jets flying in semi-formation, and the pilots of the biplane making repairs to it. It is back dropped by the regular cityscape, although the skyscrapers are more detailed in this set. There are 5 instruction booklets included, which are easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p><strong>Interesting/Hard to Find parts:</strong> There are 4 6x16 plates in dark grey and 6 support (x shape) panels also in dark grey. There are two long cockpit glass pieces (used on jets) and a short one. There is also a medium sized airplane tail in red and a printed 1x2 tile (in the cockpit of the jet with the larger red tail). The biplane uses some uncommon specialised, swept-back wing pieces in orange.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are 6 minifigures included. There is a ground airport worker, a fuel specialist worker, a male and female pilot in dark blue with an exclusive torso print (for the 2 jets) a male and female pilot (or wing walker) also with an exclusive torso print. All the pilot&#39;s torso prints are continued on the back. The jet pilots have the regular Lego City aviation logo on their uniforms and a orangish-yellow,white and red stripe. Their helmets have a dark blue and star pattern on them, which is also exclusive. The biplane pilots have a dark red flame print (the dark red matches their trousers). There is also the air show logo, which also appears on the jet&#39;s tails. I hate the flame torso print. It completely ruins the biplane pilot minifigures. Not ever stunt pilot has something to do with flames. The biplane pilots have more vintage aircraft helmets and goggles. Some long hair is included for the female pilot. The ground worker reuses the torso print from the 2015 Space line. It is an orange high-visibility jacket with a pen hanging around the neck and a name tag. His helmet has the earmuffs moulded into it. He also comes with two marshalling wands (the official name, they are just paddle pieces with transparent studs on them). The fuel specialist uses a new print for 2016, a light blue jumpsuit with an Octan logo and to pocket. (The Octan logo is the reason I refer to him as a fuel specialist). He has a regular blue cap on. (this type of cap has a hole in the top, to which earmuffs can also be added, but are not included)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A City build is very enjoyable and easy, compared to the long and hard build of a Creator Expert set, with this set being no exception. There are some interesting techniques and parts used throughout and there are not too many stickers.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>When built, you are left with two red jets, different styles, an orange biplane, a large hangar, an airport tug and a mechanic&#39;s trolley.</p>

<p>The airport tug is built on a small 7 stud long car chassis and has the small retro-style wheels. There is room for 1 minifigure and a Follow Me sign on the back, which is a sticker. (the follow me signs on the back of tugs is a commonality across almost all of the 2016 Airport sets, I really like it as I have always thought Follow Me cars were cool). There is a hose on the back, connected to a winch, which can be winded in and out. The small build next to the hose has includes the Octan colours as it is supposed to be a small fuel tank.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The orange biplane is a stunt plane. It could be a Boeing F4B (1930&#39;s biplane). Unfortunately, this plane has been &#39;raceified&#39;. There is a checker flag pattern on the engine cowling as well as on the tail. The tail has an 07 on it. (This plane could be the 7th Lego stunt plane made in the 2000&#39;s). There are stickers saying Smooth Racing and very oversized engine exhausts. I wish the designers had left it as an ordinary biplane with the handle sat the top (for the wing walker), it is becoming common for Lego to turn cool old vehicles and turn&nbsp;them into hot rod style vehicles, or in other words, ruin them. The orange and black colour scheme also continues the &#39;daredevil/stunt&#39; theme. There is supports in the middle and on the wings. The wings are swept back and the top wings are pushed forward. There is a fence piece on top of the wings for a minifigure to hold on to as a wing walker. The cockpit has a closed glass canopy and the cockpit has a control panel which is, sadly, a sticker. There are also stickers on the sides of the engine to add more detail. The engine has a Technic wheel in it for detail and the standard medium sized plane propeller. The landing gear is the wrong colours and very amateurish.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first red jet (the one with the larger tail) is very likely based on a Saab Grippen. The engines are built using Studs on the Side techniques and a clever use of a 2x2 brick with grille adds even more detail. Both jets use a red, white and black colour scheme which looks very nice. The cockpit uses a 2x2 printed tile piece as the control panel and also has a 1x1 cheese slope piece in transparent blue, representing a screen. The overall shape is very aerodynamic and this realistic and the landing gear are appropriate. The only fault is&nbsp; 1x2 jumper piece just in front of the tail, unless its where the hose is supposed to go during refueling, which appears the case.</p>

<p>The second jet is F-18 Hornet. It has the same colour scheme and cockpit windshield as the first jet. It has two smaller red tails, rather than a large one. The engines use studs on the side techniques, but some blue plates show through, which ruins this plane. There are two black engines at the black, making great use of the new dome-style piece. Unlike the first jet, this one has only one v shaped wing. (two v&rsquo;s pointing inwards). The tail ailerons (the smaller wings) are way too small. The landing gear and the cockpit (including the printed tile) are the same as the first jet.</p>

<p>The hangar is very open and basic but good. The whole back of the hangar is open, as is the front. A sticker which says Air Show Hangar and an orange line running around the bottom, clearly suggests this hangar is for the air show biplane. &nbsp;There are two lights on top of the hangar. It is the easiest thing to build in the set. The ground supports use tiles (particularly in construction of the orange line), which makes the build much easier, especially for younger builders. All the included aircraft will fit (only one at a time) inside the hangar, although, obviously, the biplane fits best. The only downside is all the visible studs, but that&rsquo;s not too bad.</p>

<p>There is also a mechanic&rsquo;s trolley and small table included. The builds of these are both very basic, but are a good way of storing the very generous number of tools.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Airport Air show is a great set, with excellent value. Three planes, six minifigures and a hangar (plus the tug and tools) is one of the best values I have seen in a Lego City set. The detail is fine, remembering it is a City set. There have been a few air show planes (Stunt Plane from 2013 would go very well with this set) but not a full air show since 1993 and this is definitely the best one so far. In U.S dollars this set is $70, which is a great price. It is $120 Australian dollars, but both prices work out the same compared to this year&rsquo;s Passenger Terminal. ($30 difference). If you are deciding between Airport Air show and Passenger Terminal, this set is better by far. For $30 cheaper you are getting way more components.</p>

<p>If you want to have an Airport in your City, I would highly recommend getting this set and Cargo Plane or VIP service, and building your own terminal and control tower. In fact, if you bought all this year&rsquo;s Airport sets, (Starter set, Cargo Plane, VIP service and Airport Air show) except Passenger Terminal, you would only be paying $15 more than just one of Passenger Terminal. That&rsquo;s 5 planes (6 if you count a small helicopter) and 15 minifigures.</p>

<p>Airport Airshow does not pass; it gets an A+++!</p>

"HuskyDynamics","2019-01-03T18:42:49.543Z","Airport Air Show","<p>The Airport Air Show is one of the more recent additions to my collection of City sets, and also one of the largest in terms of build size.&nbsp; There are three aircraft included, including a nice orange and black stunt biplane, as well as two adequately detailed stunt jets.&nbsp; There is also a rather large hangar, and also a little &quot;FOLLOW ME&quot; truck and a tool cart.</p>

<h2>Pros:</h2>

<p>The set looks truly amazing when arranged in nearly any given way, and there are no evident spots with lack or an overabundance of details</p>

<p>The biplane fits nicely into the hangar</p>

<p>The &quot;FOLLOW ME&quot; truck is cute</p>

<p>The jet pilots have really neat helmets with new printing</p>

<p>The hangar is not particularly styled for this set, and so can be used in conjunction with many other City sets, for example 60101 Cargo Plane, if desired</p>

<p>Everything fits well together</p>

<p>The hangar roof is removable</p>

<h2>Cons:</h2>

<p>The jets stick out of the hangar a bit</p>

<p>The hangar itself has three black patches on the roof, possibly meant to resemble skylights, but they look out of place here</p>

<p>None of the aircraft have retractable landing gear</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is a nice addition to anyone&#39;s City airport layout, with three detailed aircraft and a nice hangar, as well as a little &quot;FOLLOW ME&quot; truck with fuel rig.</p>
