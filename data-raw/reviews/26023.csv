Spoilers.","<p><strong>Set #41131 LEGO Friends Advent Calendar:</strong> It&rsquo;s that time of year again, dare I say it&rsquo;s even earlier than that time of year again? Either way, another year, another LEGO Friends Advent Calendar, and I warn you in advance this review is going to spoil the contents of this product, so if you wish to avoid being spoiled before December than stop reading now.</p>

<p><strong>Box</strong></p>

<p>Like with the past three years of these reviews I applaud the wonderful box designs found in LEGO Friends Advent Calendars. You will always receive a beautiful looking package with images of festive merriment. Two friends, Emma and the new Mini-Doll grace the cover alongside a scene of preparing presents for others in Emma&rsquo;s home.</p>

<p>Open the flap and you&rsquo;ll find a great placemat style play area, this year&rsquo;s is the interior of Emma&rsquo;s house with all of the doors marked with a place outside her front yard including a small frozen pond for skating and some festively decorated trees.</p>

<p>The back of the box shows how the advent calendar works, as well as cross-promotional elements involving LEGO Friends online and a hint as to some digital freebies for certain days of the month.</p>

<p><strong>Advent Models</strong></p>

<p>Day 1: Emma;</p>

<p>As I noted in the 2015 review, Emma was the last of the main Friends characters who has yet to receive a festive outfit, this year rectifies that by giving us Christmas Emma. She&rsquo;s decked out in a pair of light brown slacks, with dark brown boots, a gorgeous looking green jacket with a furry white scarf and pom-poms dangling on strings to tie up the hood (which not shown on the back as they never print those since the hair mostly covers it up traditionally.). Her jacket is a nice holiday shade of green that truly highlights the colour of her eyes. All in all a fun little festive Mini-Doll to get started with. We shall see what Day 2 brings next.</p>

<p>Day 2: Ice Skates &amp; Bench;</p>

<p>Six pieces are used to create a small bench for Emma to sit on and put her skates on before heading out to skate with her friends. The model is a fairly simple one and features two 1x2 purple tiles as well as a red flower with an extra for your parts. You get two full pairs of skates and half of another, which means you can have three pairs if you pair this half with the half found in last year&rsquo;s calendar as an extra. Not much more to say here, it&rsquo;s a nice little model and always fun to get more skates as they aren&rsquo;t very common. Shall Day 3 be an interesting model, or a dud? We shall discover shortly.</p>

<p>Day 3: Mailbox;</p>

<p>Not especially festive in design, this little model is built with roughly five pieces and features a green flower stud on top of a white jumper for a holiday deco. Inside is a single letter, so Emma is either mailing a Christmas card to one of her friends or perhaps an invitation to go skating with her.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not sure if this is an old printed letter tile or something brand new, most letter tiles found in LEGO Friends sets feature a name of some sort on the envelope from what I can recall. This tile features just a bit of lines representing address writing and a small red square for a stamp. I feel as though I&rsquo;ve seen this print before, and yet I don&rsquo;t recall where, so perhaps it is a bit rarer compared to the newer print LEGO has chosen of late. Either way it&rsquo;s a nice looking piece with a great useful print. Not a bad model for day three, will day four bring even more impressive builds?</p>

<p>Day 4: Holiday Candle;</p>

<p>Similar to last year we find a small buildable candle decoration, last year it was a centrepiece for the table if I recall properly, this year it could be anything. Perhaps a decoration for somewhere in the house that lights up with batteries and bulbs instead of flames and lighters.</p>

<p>The model is relatively simple with less than ten pieces in total, and the biggest part of interest is the 1x3 purple plate. Everything else is all fairly common and to be honest it isn&rsquo;t as exciting as a play item compared to the skates and mailbox from the previous two days. However you can take these parts and the rest and build an alternative construct, I may come back to that and check it out once December 4<sup>th</sup> rolls around and the instructions online go live, for now let&rsquo;s move on to see what day five will produce.</p>

<p>Day 5: Naomi;</p>

<p>On the fifth day of the calendar Emma&rsquo;s new friend Naomi answers her letter to help pack presents, go skating and who knows what else. She has a very nice festive coloured top, it&rsquo;s a sharp looking red jacket with a white top peeking out from underneath the collar. Her skirt is a rich maroon colour and she includes white leggings and a pair of matching boots. All-in-all another great looking Friends mini-doll. I like the brown hair piece she&rsquo;s sporting too, this is Mia&rsquo;s typical hair piece in brown, a colour I don&rsquo;t recall seeing before now.</p>

<p>Will day six include a nice new activity for the pair of Friends to engage in? Find out tomorrow&hellip; or right now&hellip;while reading this review.</p>

<p>Day 6: Hamster Habitat;</p>

<p>Naomi or Emma seem to have brought a pet along, this is a pretty interesting model, though not much festive or holiday themed. But it does offer up more play opportunities and this particular animal piece hasn&rsquo;t been used very often at the moment. As far as the model is concerned we&rsquo;ve got a small water bottle for the hamster, a bit of green for food using the carrot top piece and a little arch. It&rsquo;s good for what it is, though it might have been nice to see more red and green pieces used to make this more holiday themed, since most builds like this can be found quite often in LEGO Friends animal type sets. Will the seventh offer up something more festive to enjoy? We shall see.</p>

<p>Day 7: Small Fireplace;</p>

<p>This cute little model has used the most pieces so far and features a fun Christmas wreath, I believe this is also the first holiday decorated model from the set, nothing else has been festively decked out yet, with possible exception to the candle we saw early in the builds. It&rsquo;s very cozy looking and the pieces used are highly impressive, with some teal 1x2 plates a 2x4 purple plate and two black curved bumpers, or arches or whatever they&rsquo;re officially called.</p>

<p>Either way now Emma and Naomi can sit down in front of the fireplace and enjoy a bit of hot chocolate, or perhaps warm up after skating in the snow. Will day 8 continue this trend of nifty little models? We shall see.</p>

<p>Day 8: Santa&rsquo;s Treats;</p>

<p>This is a tad early, but Emma and Naomi have prepared a small tray of cookies and milk for St. Nick&rsquo;s yearly visit, and there&rsquo;s even a carrot for his tired and hard working reindeer. There is literally very little to build here, you receive a 2x3 purple plate for a tray, a white coffee mug, one of the printed milk cartons with cheese wedge for the top, a LEGO carrot and stem and a printed cookie stud, the cream filled kind. Mmmm, mmm.</p>

<p>Now granted this doesn&rsquo;t have to be for Santa, it could just be a little snack for the mini-dolls to share, however it does fit the theme of Holiday Tradition which says leaving out cookies and milk with a carrot for the reindeer is what one does. And it goes well alongside the tiny fireplace from yesterday as a thematic continuation. It isn&rsquo;t much, but it does have great play value, despite only featuring seven pieces in total. (Eight if you use the extra printed cookie stud as a second cookie.) Will tomorrow bring something more substantial to build? Time shall reveal all.</p>

<p>Day 9: Christmas Karaoke Stage;</p>

<p>Judging by what&rsquo;s included here I&rsquo;m fairly certain that&rsquo;s what today is. And it is a bit on the weaker side unfortunately. It isn&rsquo;t a very large stage and only features seven parts with two 2x3 purple plates, a microphone and a turntable piece for the mini-doll to stand on. Plus a few coloured studs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m afraid it is a weaker model because of how few parts there are, however I will admit it does have a nice play element to it for the mini-dolls included with this set. Plus we get two of the microphone accessories in a nice black with a gold top. While it could have been better by including a musical playback device for the songs, I suspect tomorrow might expand on this model to make both days much better combined. We&rsquo;ll just have to wait and see.</p>

<p>Day 10: Piano;</p>

<p>This was expected, the pictures on the box kind of spoil this model as being included in the Calendar, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean this is a bad model. In fact taking this piano and adding yesterday&rsquo;s little stage makes a nice looking scene for some Christmas sing-along fun. It is a bit unfortunate there is no bench to sit on while playing the piano, but perhaps if one doesn&rsquo;t come up later than you can always make your own to go with it.</p>

<p>You get a printed music sheet tile today too and the little piano is nicely built using I believe the most parts so far in any of the models with 18 pieces in total used in the build. What could the next day be? We shall see shortly.</p>

<p>Day 11: Guitar &amp; Stand;</p>

<p>This is a nice little model, in keeping with the musical theme of the past few days. It features a very lovely looking purple guitar with some really nice printing on it. The little stand is a nice buildable model as well, with a nice 1x2 dark pink brink and a pink jumper piece. I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s got to be a very impressive addition and the guitar is the biggest draw for it. Not especially festive, however it goes well with the Pop Star sub-theme, on Monday we&rsquo;ll see what comes next, I am looking forward to it.</p>

<p>Day 12: Friends Utensils Set;</p>

<p>Well talk about disappointing, nothing to build today, just the same old, same old. Ordinarily this wouldn&rsquo;t be such a bad thing, as these utensils are always quite nice and you can never have too many plates, knives and forks. The problem is they are always the same dull yellow colour, LEGO hasn&rsquo;t made them available in any other colours, and on top of that, for something like an Advent Calendar there should at least be something to build involved.</p>

<p>Why not include a small cupboard to store them in, or a little table, or even a small baking over to use with them? It is extremely disheartening to see these yet again, I and I&rsquo;m certain many others have gotten these for the past four years, and since none of the other Calendars just slap accessories into one of their windows with nothing to build alongside them (to reemphasize) than the designers of these LEGO Friends Advent Calendars are exceptionally lazy and downright irritating. Oh well, enough harping on that, I tend to do it every year when we reach this window I&rsquo;m afraid, on to tomorrow and hopefully something large and fun to build to make up for no building today.</p>

<p>Day 13: Seats &amp; Treats;</p>

<p>It would appear that Emma and Naomi baked a few cupcakes with those accessories the other day, not sure how without a stove, but they now have a few treats to enjoy while sitting on some brand new little seats. And I do mean little, these models are quite low to the ground, and don&rsquo;t look like a very stable sitting location for mini-dolls. They are wide enough being made with a 2x2 square plate and some smooth teal parts, however I&rsquo;m not sure if they would keep the mini-dolls from falling off the sides if jostled too much. (I have yet to attempt sitting them down.)</p>

<p>The tray is just that, a 2x2 gray plate which can hold the two cupcakes (though there are enough brown studs and gold whipped topping pieces to make three in total.), overall not much to today&rsquo;s model, but it at least is a nice improvement over yesterday&rsquo;s dismal showing. At least you can actually play with these and your minidolls more. I wonder what tomorrow will bring? We shall see.</p>

<p>Day 14: Small coffee table;</p>

<p>6 pieces make up the build today, featuring three parts and three Minifigure accessories. It&rsquo;s a nice little table that fits in with the scale of yesterday&rsquo;s chairs, so now Emma and Naomi have somewhere to sit. I find this extremely disappointing as far as building goes though because you&rsquo;re only building with three pieces.</p>

<p>The rest are two red coffee mugs and the highlight of the door, a pink teapot, at first I thought this was a pink version of the Genie lamp from the CMF line, it wasn&rsquo;t until I really took a good look at it that I realized this is the new Teapot piece used in Belle&rsquo;s Castle for Mrs. Potts. This is an awesome looking piece and in a fairly unique colour, sadly there is no printing on it, it might have been nice to see a few flowers and butterflies on it, but I suppose it would be too much to ask for something like an Advent Calendar. Overall a very nice day, a bit of downer as far as building is concerned, but strong with the unique piece count as this new teapot hasn&rsquo;t been seen much in LEGO form to date. Will tomorrow continue to improve upon this little scene of tranquility and sharing treats with Friends? Wait and see.</p>

<p>Day 15: Camera on Stand;</p>

<p>There is very little once again in the way of building here. I&rsquo;m afraid that means you&rsquo;re going to see disappointment in some builders&rsquo; eyes, why? Because there isn&rsquo;t much here.</p>

<p>As an AFOL I actually enjoy this door quite a bit, the camera is a nice accessory and to give it a quadra-pod using the LEGO lantern piece is a really nice idea, it works very well as a solid looking model. Unfortunately there isn&rsquo;t much to do with it, Emma and Naomi can take pictures, maybe make a holiday card with a custom photo of them baking or performing some other festive bit of fun with the past 14 doors&rsquo; worth of gifts. That&rsquo;s using imagination, but since the build is over so quickly it might be somewhat disappointing because of it.</p>

<p>Still it isn&rsquo;t the worst offender an Advent Calendar has given as a gift, not by a long shot. Will tomorrow present us with a festive photogenic activity for the Minidolls to do now that they have their camera? I guess we&rsquo;ll find out together when the 16 hits.</p>

<p>Day 16: Present Preparing Table;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m assuming that&rsquo;s what this is as it is a nice little table with a pair of scissors on top, a piece of what could be wrapping paper represented as a tile attached to a jumper and a small tube of glue. This little glue bottle build is very clever, it uses the new Dalek eyestalk piece for the top of the glue bottle with a regular white cylinder for the bottle part.</p>

<p>This is definitely looking more festive, Emma and Naomi are getting ready to make presents, I suspect that tomorrow we might be seeing a follow up to this build. As a bonus you get two pairs of scissors, so both Minidolls can wrap presents. A fun little model overall, and tomorrow we shall see what the two friends are going to wrap, perhaps.</p>

<p>Day 17: Presents;</p>

<p>I was right, and it was expected as these were pictured on the front of the box, two little gifts to build and it&rsquo;s not very bad, a nice festive addition to the models. The gifts are built fairly similar to how we&rsquo;ve seen these models for a few years now, the reverse 2x4 printed square tiles are used for the tops of the gifts. They include a pink and orange one with two distinct ribbon/gift wrapper print.</p>

<p>The gifts aren&rsquo;t fairly large, they can only hold one small item. On gift is a hair ribbon accessory in orange and the other is a pair of pink sunglasses, odd gifts to be sure, you also get one extra of each gift, but as I said the present models are too small to hold both, at least for the ribbons, you can fit both shades into their respective box and still close the lid properly.</p>

<p>Overall some nice models, albeit spoiled from the pictures on the box. I&rsquo;m looking forward to tomorrow and what will be brought to the table that day.</p>

<p>Day 18: Christmas Tree;</p>

<p>A bit early for this type of model, however in order to put something under it you do need a tree. I believe this one has the most pieces so far and it&rsquo;s built pretty much identical to how past models of this sort have been. The &lsquo;star&rsquo; on top is a diamond jewel instead. Honestly there isn&rsquo;t much to discuss here, LEGO does Christmas Trees quite often and they all look pretty much the same, if you collect a lot of Advent Calendars and Holiday sets you&rsquo;ll have a lot of them lying around for your display.</p>

<p>Overall it&rsquo;s a good model and I do like its inclusion. Now on to the next day, when tomorrow we find out how LEGO will top this model.</p>

<p>Day 19: Record Player &amp; Party Hats;</p>

<p>Emma and Naomi are preparing to hold a Christmas Party it would appear, today&rsquo;s build was very minimalistic with only a small number of parts. Six to be precise, there is a seventh part that I suspect is meant to be a replacement needle just in case the needle on the Player breaks. Speaking of which this is a great printed piece, we&rsquo;ve seen records before, however this is the first time I&rsquo;ve seen this one in gold. It&rsquo;s a welcome addition as a part.</p>

<p>Also included are the new attachable party hats for the Minidoll hair pieces, you get one blue and one yellow, with a second set as spares in case of being lost. Honestly this is a truly great looking set piece and I especially enjoy how the record player was built, using the old control rod pieces for a needle to play the record with. Overall an awesome day, hopefully tomorrow will continue this interesting party themed idea for your minidolls.</p>

<p>Day 20: Turkey Warmer/Cooker;</p>

<p>I have no idea what this is meant to be, at first glance I thought it was a small barbecue for a turkey leg, however in keeping with a party theme this may actually be a warming table for keeping the food warm while the guests are having fun. Either way it&rsquo;s an odd inclusion for an Advent Calendar and the model is rather small, not to mention quick to build. You&rsquo;ll have two turkey legs and some mostly black parts for this build, a circular jumper is also included.</p>

<p>I would say this is a weaker idea for a gift, sure it presents more party themed opportunities for Emma and Naomi, now they can have some Christmas turkey with their music, however there&rsquo;s nothing truly unique here and with only four more days of builds I was hoping we&rsquo;d see a little better thought out designs. Oh well, on to the 21<sup>st</sup> and perhaps it will be a better offering than today.</p>

<p>Day 21: Christmas Cake &amp; Froster;</p>

<p>I find myself at a bit of a loss once again upon opening and building the two items behind todays&rsquo; door. It will probably turn out to be something dreadfully obvious, however I must admit that on first guess I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s some kind of decorated item, possibly a cookie jar and something else.</p>

<p>Those were my thoughts upon initially opening the door, and I&rsquo;ve puzzled away at it for quite some time, as it turns out I should have paid closer attention to the picture drawn on the box, sitting on the kitchen counter is a nice looking Christmas Cake covered in white frosting, possibly a Fruitcake, who can truly say. But after realizing what it is I must admit to not only feeling a bit foolish, but I am definitely not a huge fan of it. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I do still enjoy it for what it is, unfortunately I fear that it falls a bit flat. The white Astromech dome on top of the small circular plate is a poor job of capturing the look of the cake as seen in the picture, it makes it appear to be far too much frosting and not enough actual cake.</p>

<p>I do love the use of the green flower piece with the red cherries to make what I assume to be Holly, as it&rsquo;s a very nice use of the parts in a fun and different way. I&rsquo;m not sold on the odd nozzle with the curious topper though, I&rsquo;m not sure what LEGO&rsquo;s designers were aiming for, but it just looks weak and is definitely a wasted opportunity. And if, it is indeed a device used to apply frosting onto cakes it is a terrible looking one, I&rsquo;d much rather have a new unique accessory for that sort of thing than this poor attempt at brick building one, I dare say I could MOC up one with a much more easily recognizable design compared to this one. Oh well, on to the next door tomorrow and the excitement that hopefully won&rsquo;t lead to disappointment or confusion for most of the day until a chance observation enlightens me to the truth of the matter.</p>

<p>Day 22: Small Table;</p>

<p>Today you get a small table build, which isn&rsquo;t that bad, it&rsquo;s meant to be a companion piece for yesterday&rsquo;s cake. There is a jumper in the center of the table that the cake can be placed on. Honestly this isn&rsquo;t too terrible, it is a bit of a weak model to receive with only a few days left until Christmas, however the model is nice enough for what you get. It is a table folks, there&rsquo;s very little to say about it, although I will admit it is on the shorter end of things, typically LEGO tables are at least high enough that when a minidoll stands beside them their at about chest height. This model seems a bit on the short side.</p>

<p>Overall the table looks ok, it gives you somewhere to put the cake and does give more to decorate your living room or wherever the party Emma and Naomi are throwing to celebrate the holidays is being celebrated. Two more days to go, will they be impressive or disappointing? We&rsquo;ll have to wait and see.</p>

<p>Day 23: Snowman;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see something recognizable for a change, and this little snowman is a very fun looking model with some great build techniques. You&rsquo;ll find the LEGO skeleton legs for arms, an R4 Astromech dome unprinted for the lower torso and a 1x1 four sided headlight brick with a snotless stud for the middle torso. The head is a clear white Minifigure head and a red clip piece is used to make a fun looking scarf.</p>

<p>Wearing a black captain&rsquo;s hat from LEGO Police sets this little snowman is a great build and looks great for todays&rsquo; model. And it&rsquo;s always nice to see the numerous methods for constructing snowmen in LEGO form. Only one day left, will tomorrow have a great closer for this year&rsquo;s calendar, or will it crash and burn at the last mile? We shall see.</p>

<p>Day 24: Polar Bear w/Iceberg;</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the final day of this LEGO Friends Advent Calendar and this little build is not especially Christmas related, however it feels like a much better ending than previous years have been.</p>

<p>You get a nice little model to build that goes with the LEGO Friends Bear Cub animal piece in a new white colour meant to be a polar bear cub. He or she is awfully cute. Compared to the other Advent Calendars that typically get a form of Santa this might seem like a bad idea, however it&rsquo;s nice and solid and has a lot of potential for play.</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ll also get a clear donut piece to represent the ice on top of the circular iceberg, or ice fishing spot, as the little LEGO fish hopping out (represented by being attached to a LEGO droid arm) looks very well made. Overall not a bad model, not a unique Santa Minidoll, but not bad at all.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Like with most Advent Calendars there are good days and then there are bad, most of the models in this build or on the small side and don&rsquo;t incorporate a lot of pieces. Combined together though they make a nice display piece and offer loads of potential for play.</p>

<p>I fear though that my complaints remain when it comes to LEGO Friends, the designers do their best, however a lot of these Calendars are starting to get a little repetitive from LEGO Friends, and it still annoys me that LEGO City and Star Wars get a lot of days with Minifigures to build compared to these Friends Calendars that only have two. Granted you also typically get two animal pieces, which could be like Minidolls, however I&rsquo;d prefer to start seeing at least three or more minidolls, some of the models in the Calendar could easily be in one window, considering how few parts are actually in use, combining these smaller models in one window and giving more minidolls in the freed up spaces would add better value to the LEGO Friends Advent Calendar line.</p>

<p>And stop giving us those accessories for cooking, plates and forks and knives are always quite useful, but for fans of LEGO Friends that collect many of the sets since the Theme began I&rsquo;d presume that they have many of those accessory packs already. Perhaps they&rsquo;re cheap to include, since you don&rsquo;t have to build anything that day, however it is a huge let down for anyone, even I&rsquo;d imagine the targeted age range who have brothers who own the Star Wars Advent Calendars and get buildable items every day.</p>

<p>Overall I recommend this set for fans of the Theme who enjoy collecting and building every day leading up to Christmas, and for folks who enjoy the holiday prints these Minidolls always get. I&rsquo;d say to skip it if you want more to do and build once you crack open the set.</p>
