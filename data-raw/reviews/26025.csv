<p>The wind dragon is well-sized and extremely pose-able&nbsp;with many joints and a sturdy build. The colour scheme is very pleasant&nbsp;and I love the purple colour scheme. The figures are also fantastic with Tidus&nbsp;and Aira being wonderful Minidolls as always with the Elves theme. The baby dragon Rayne is also very cute and small and I love the blue faceted egg although it is hard to see the dragon through it.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sanctuary build is well-sized and perfect for displaying the baby dragon eggs. It has wonderful moving functions like the moving platform and the slide out standing area thing. The exterior detail is fantastic and super detailed as we expect from Elves.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The water slide part and the raft are nice but don&#39;t add much to the set, but it&#39;s nice to have it.</p>

<p>I love every part of this set and you will NOT regret getting this! It truly is the best lego elves dragon set or even the best elves set! (It&#39;s hard to say&nbsp;there are many great sets from elves)</p>

<p>The baby dragon is adorable and a nice touch to the set and I like that this set includes so many fun details with the dragon being beautiful executed in lego form.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bring Back Lego Elves!!!</p>
