"LoveAlwaysMakeup","2016-10-12T18:57:01.32Z","Parent of 3 Lego lovers and a Lego junkie myself...","<p>I can&#39;t say enough how much I disliked the idea of the Lego Elves, but I hope you read this review and maybe change your mind like I did. I have classic Lego sets and tons of Friends sets for my three girls (and selfishly myself!&nbsp;HA!) Looking back I could kick myself for dismissing the elves sets so quickly. They are full of great parts, colors and brilliant movable and hidden areas....which make Lego even MORE fun!!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Easy to follow as always. Having the parts bagged by number makes it goof proof. However, this set has a lot of parts so clear your afternoon!!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has some great parts in unique colors. I passed on the elves collection at first, but after watching a few videos the colors and parts really got me excited. This set doesn&#39;t disappoint on new pieces, color, shape and design.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not a huge fan of the ears on the elves&nbsp;hair but I get it. I do like the metal tattoo details on the face, arms, etc. My kids love that the hair is two different colors in the girls.&nbsp;The animals/dragon have great detail as well, not plan at all, rather detailed and colorful.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It definitely takes some time to put this castle together but that&#39;s my favorite part so I don&#39;t mind at all. I didn&#39;t have any problems thanks to the numbered bags and detailed instructions. My eight year old was easily able to build with me. The castle has so much detail it&#39;s an extremely fun build and makes you feel like every penny was worth it. I really love this set and decided to order more elves sets after this build!!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The size is fantastic, the look is really nice...however I do wish that less black bricks were&nbsp;used. I understand that this is an evil queen so it fits, but selfishly I really love the bright colors of the Lego elves sets and wish this was the same. That being said, all of the detail, magic compartments and moving parts/areas completely make up for it. I would most definitely purchase this set all over again and plan on giving it as Christmas gifts.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I love everything about this set. I had looked into the first Lego elves castle with the portal and was disappointed with the lack of play in the back/not much to do with it once it&#39;s built. This&nbsp;castle is completely the opposite. Lego has made each area, back and front playable, has great detail and endless playability. I was able to get my set at a discount but I would gladly pay full price after building the set and playing with it. Again, I wish it had less black but the set is for an evil queen so I understand why they used so much of it. My daughter really enjoys monster high so it fits with that theme as well. The &quot;magic&quot; of the magic shadow castle is absolutely captured in this set. Secret compartments, a way to drop a figure from the floor they are standing on into a jail, a disappearing bridge, an&nbsp;exploding wall, and more,&nbsp;makes this the best build I have done in awhile. I highly recommend checking out the elves collection even if you have boys or it&#39;s not your &quot;thing&quot;. The beautiful colored bricks/crystals&nbsp;to use for other builds alone is worth it. What truly got me interested is how much more playable these sets are for kids...because unlike I have ever seen by Lego it&#39;s loaded with moving areas/parts, etc. The crystals, transparent colored bricks and potion bottles can&#39;t help but get you excited.&nbsp;I hope this helps someone else give the Lego elves sets a chance!! I think they are perfect for boys and girls or any aged Lego fan. It&#39;s fantastic to see such an amazing toy to begin with become even better!!</p>

"Sethro3","2017-01-24T21:26:28.283Z","This set is bewitching","<p>My daughter loves the Elves sets. By association I have grown to not overlook them. They are full of interesting new pieces or at least new colors and usually have good builds associated with them. It feels LEGO isn&#39;t just trying to sell bricks, but instead a story.</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>- The printing on the figures is really neat. I don&#39;t love minidolls, but they are highly detailed.</p>

<p>- New hairpieces/hoods. Ragana&#39;s hair with crown is amazing. I&#39;d love it in a different hair color though. The elf hoods are a welcome change to the normal hood. Although I am confused as to why their ears would stick outside of the hood. It must be some sort of wrap instead? But they are neat either way.</p>

<p>- Black and purple look really good together while maintaining a &quot;girly&quot; feel to the theme. Not that Elves has to be linked to only girls, but more often than not, it is aimed at them. But I like seeing a black castle. It reminds me of the Black Knights from my youth.</p>

<p>- The build is actually quite interesting. It has a nice foundation and the bridge over to the dungeon area is useful.</p>

<p>- Interior has neat features. The use of stickers is necessary and works quite well here. I like the book shelves. Her bed is extremely clever. I love the black horn pieces used. Her throne room too. Very clever.</p>

<p>- there is a bathroom!! like almost every other Friends set. It&#39;s funny how they throw them in there.</p>

<p>- There is a clever technique for the front doors too. Interesting build and interesting mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- Actually feels kind of small for how expensive it is. Over 1000 pieces, but a lot of small pieces, so that doesn&#39;t help.</p>

<p>- The catapult is nice, but really small. I guess it makes sense if the Elves were pushing it though.</p>

<p>- I&#39;d like a bit more foliage around the throne room area. For whatever reason LEGO has never included that many leaf pieces in any set. Not sure why. But easy enough to fix on your own.</p>

<p>- This has nothing to do with the set per se, but the egg shell is huge compared to how they are presented in the illustrations. I understand LEGO is reusing pieces and it is neat enough to be used elsewhere. Limitations of the mold/detail they want to present I guess.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>A welcome addition to the Elves theme. I like seeing an adversary to the Elves to add more depth to their story. I do maintain the set comes off as a bit small compared to the cost, so I would recommend waiting for a sale. I have heard people finding them at walmart for 50-70% off. We paid full price and I don&#39;t necessarily regret it, but anytime you can get a sale, the better. (I still recommend it though). Find it if you can. They might be clearing the shelves for the new Goblin subtheme.</p>

"The_Crea1or","2017-10-15T22:48:20.63Z","The Bad and the Beautiful","<p>I had my eye on this set for a while and finally I decided to but it on my Christmas list. The set does not disappoint in any way and is a magnificent display piece when finished. I&#39;m a male teen and I normally tend to stay away from sets with mini-dolls, but I simply couldn&#39;t resist the outstanding architecture of this evil castle.&nbsp;<br />
The build was very straight-forward build and is packed with details and features that kids will love to uncover and play with. My only complaint is that the figure selection seems a little small for a set of this size, but I discovered that all Elves sets come with a relatively small selection of figures.&nbsp;<br />
This set has officially gotten me hooked on the Elves set line for good and I plan to purchase many more in the future!</p>

"lentil","2017-02-28T16:10:54.253Z","Good creepy fun","<p>I bought this because my daughter wanted it. Honestly I was expecting it to be sort of like a Friends set (i.e., pretty sucky) but with Elves. Boy was I wrong! This set is quite impressive, in terms of visual appeal, cool and unusual parts, imaginative design, and interesting play features. I&rsquo;m an AFOL, so this review will primarily be from my point of view, although I&rsquo;ll add in a few observations from my 10-year old as well. We have never seen the show by the way, so we have absolutely no idea who these characters are&hellip; prior familiarity with the theme does not seem to be a prerequisite for enjoying the set.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>I really like the design of this castle. It&rsquo;s got a great vampire glam thing going throughout, with lots of spiky black teeth on a hot pink background. The lime green foliage against the lavender bricks by the main entrance is a bit lurid for my taste, but overall the color scheme is great: lots of black and dark purple, with lime, grey, and lavender accents. I also love the abundance of trans bricks (blue, green, and yellow) that are used for decorative &ldquo;crystal&rdquo; elements &ndash; these infuse a colorful sparkle into what might otherwise have been an overly dark scene. This is one that looks much nicer in person to me than it does in pictures for some reason. The pieces included would also be ideal for anyone who is looking to MOC a haunted house/evil castle type of thing, or basically anything creepy.</p>

<p>Structurally the castle consists of two buildings: a 3-story main building, and a 2-story adjoining wing. These are connected by a narrow bridge, with a small waterfall and mountainous cavern below. The main building contains a large living room on the first floor, a bedroom on the second with balconies on either side, and a small bathroom on the third. On top of the main building there is a 4<sup>th</sup> floor rooftop balcony with a crystal egg housing the baby dragon. One of the bedroom balconies has a small staircase leading up to a potions room, and the other balcony has a stair leading down to the connecting bridge. The adjoining wing has a throne room on the second floor, and a dungeon room below. There is also a little perch on the roof of the throne room for the black cat, who seems to be enjoying a feast of sushi and ice cream there.</p>

<p>Overall it is quite a large and complex structure, with lots of rooms and accessories. The interior is nicely detailed with gorgey furnishings, and generally looks like it was designed by the love child of Elvira and Elton John. My favorite piece of furniture is the hot pink and silver couch, with rows of black teeth studding the back and arms. The master bed is similarly luxurious. The chandelier and hanging lights in black and trans green look smashing too, and the bathroom and potion room have some great little accessories, including a large cauldron and a cool green potions bottle which is new to me. Ragana has an awesome crystal ball, and black and green crystal staff which is a favorite of my daughter.</p>

<p>The exterior is very imaginatively done. The lower part of the castle has been hewn out of a (creepy lavender) moss-covered mountain, while the upper parts have tree branches with pink foliage sprouting colorful gemstones and green teeth. It looks as if some of the rooms were built into the hollows of these weird trees. Overall lots of fun.</p>

<h3>Minidolls and critters</h3>

<p>The set includes two elf minidolls and Queen Ragana, as well as a white and turquoise baby dragon and cute little black cat. All are beautifully detailed and very attractive &ndash; I especially love the elves&rsquo; nifty ombre hairdos! Their little pointy elf ears are so cute poking out of their hair. The elves have two interchangeable headpiece options: a cloaked headpiece or the flowing rainbow hair. Ragana has just one hairstyle, featuring an imposing crown.</p>

<h3>Play features</h3>

<p>Most surprising to us were the tons of creative and fun movable play features in this set:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The main entrance to the castle opens and closes by sliding the stairway forwards and back, allowing you to suck visitors on the front porch into the castle, or making it seem like the doors open on their own.</li>
	<li>The dungeon has a trapdoor in the ceiling that operates with a lever, so that attendants to Ragana&rsquo;s throneroom above can be unceremoniously dumped into prison.</li>
	<li>But the back wall of the dungeon can also be blasted out with another secret lever for a magical escape!</li>
	<li>The communication bridge between the bedroom and the throne room rotates, allowing unwanted travelers to be hurled onto the spiky stream below.</li>
	<li>Ragana&rsquo;s throne spins around, allowing her to hide (sort of?).</li>
	<li>Ragana&rsquo;s bed has a concealed drawer on the bottom which contains a hidden map and some correspondence (a love letter perhaps?)</li>
	<li>The elves have a wheeled, winged, crystal fobbing catapult that will hurl small legos across your living room. (You may want to considering hide this one from your children.)</li>
</ul>

<p>All are fun both to build and to play with.</p>

<p>Here are a few more miscellaneous pros &amp; cons:</p>

<p><strong>Con</strong>: soooo many stickers&hellip; everything has a sticker! Gah!</p>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: beautiful design on the stickers. Really really lovely. (But I still hate attaching them.)</p>

<p><strong>Con</strong>: a fair amount of BURP type pieces, tall bricks, and pillars, which some might object to.</p>

<p><strong>Pro</strong>: the BURPs are lavender and actually look pretty cool. So do the abundant dark purple pillars, and the tall trans brick that is used for the stained glass window. Probably would not look as cool if everything was brick-built.</p>

<p><strong>Con</strong>: the flag/banner things that hang from the towers are made of plastic and have a kind of cheap look. Fabric would have been nicer.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>This appears to be the most complex and interesting of the Elves sets to date, but based on our experience with this one, I would certainly buy more in this theme. My daughter absolutely could not wait to play with it, and actually got started while it was still under construction. This set ranks up there with the Harry Potter sets in her estimation, which is to say pretty darn high! Great to see LEGO put out a marketed-to-girls theme with this type of complexity and functional technic elements. (Not that it would appeal only to girls either.) This set blends elements of classic castle, haunted house, and even Lord of the Rings in a really creative way. Hoping they keep this line going.</p>
