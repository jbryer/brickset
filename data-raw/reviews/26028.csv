<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A medium sized, sturdy box with the red Juniors branding and bright illustrations of the set in action all around. This is aimed at younger builders so the instructions take it a few bricks at a time and do a great job, as usual</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There a quite a few bigger pieces here: the vehicle bases and the wall and plate sections for the &#39;Bat-cave&#39; for example but otherwise it&#39;s pretty standard bricks and doesn&#39;t feel or look like it&#39;s been overly dumbed down. There are no stickers and quite a few printed pieces including various Bat logos, computer parts&nbsp;and decorative tiles and slopes for Lex Luthors&nbsp;Robo-thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lex&#39;s vehicle features the most interesting pieces, mostly in lime and medium green, plus a flexible hose piece and claws in silver. The Batcave&nbsp;includes a disc shooter which is really quite effective.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>3 very nice figures in this set and again, they haven&#39;t been simplified. Superman looks great with his&nbsp;curled&nbsp;hair piece, Lex has a moulded&nbsp;armour piece over his printed torso and you get a classic&nbsp;blue Batman to round things off. Batman also gets some accessories in the form of some Batarangs, a radio and a grapple gun, Lex gets a Kryptonite&nbsp;gun. Superman just gets an alternate face with his laser eyes.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The product age range says 4-7 and my&nbsp;4 1/2 year old put this together himself with only a couple of small prompts so it really does what it says on the box. He is a confident builder for his age but even so I think this offers a fun experience for older kids too. Techniques are mostly straight up but there&#39;s a little bit of SNOT on the 2 vehicles, just to keep things interesting. The resulting models are robust with only the trans bright green aerial piece on the the robot prone to snagging and coming off in play.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>&quot;It&#39;s very colourful!&quot; he said on completion - and so it is, straight out of a kids comic. Yes, this is a younger ones set but it looks great and begs to be played with. The batcave section is the least visually appealing bit to me but it still adds value to the set.</p>

<p>My favourite part is the bright green Lex-o-bot. It trundles around on wide wheels and the assymetrical&nbsp;arms and claw hand look fun and menacing at the same time.</p>

<p>The Batmobile is not bad either, definitely more from the classic TV style than the recent movie designs but it rolls well across the floor and holds together well for play.</p>

<p>The oddest bit - at least to the AFOL - is the Superman catapult, but put yourself in the child&#39;s place and of course its a way to make Superman fly. Well, fall with style anyway.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This was 100% my son&#39;s choice and I think he made a good one. He got a lot of satisfaction from building it all himself and the result is a good looking and fun TOY to play with. The RRP at &pound;20 GBP is a little steep so look for discounts. That said you&#39;re still getting a full play set and some great minifigs so its worth picking up if you have a younger super fan in the family.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-08-10T06:47:22.203Z","Wonderful set for your little superhero ","<p>What makes this set great is all the separate components and the fact that you get Batman, Superman, and Lex Luther.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lex&rsquo;s mech, the Batcave, the Batmobile, and Superman&rsquo;s catapult are all sufficiently small enough to keep your little one&rsquo;s attention. My son will at least build two of them by himself if not all of them. Lex Luther&rsquo;s mech is a little complex and may require some help, but my 4 year old can do it by himself if I talk him through it.</p>

<p>After that, you have a whole lot to play with which is the best thing about this set. Plus there are enough special pieces to offer your kid creativity in moving around pieces (such as the kryptonite). This is one of my son&rsquo;s favorite sets for the simple reason that it gives him a lot to play with and there is no need to combine it with any other sets.&nbsp;</p>
