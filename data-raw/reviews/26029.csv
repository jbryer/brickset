<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Easy instructions of course. I love the box art for this and it is very inspirational for photo shots. I have three of these.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Very great selection of parts but I do wish they had made it a bit taller and charged and extra $20 to make it a story taller. I have added some parts to the three I have joined together so far to make it taller.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Awesome, and though certainly not the only reason to buy this set, they are a substantial part of the reason. I really love the inclusion of all the bad guys and spidermen/women. It&#39;s not often you get a set with such a fine figure selection.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is great and I thoroughly enjoyed it the first time through. The second and third time seemed more repetitive but I did them both in one night. The build went a lot faster without having to worry about stickers or any of the rocks/cement on the bottom since I just MOC&#39;d that part throughout the build in my city.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Great! Again, I wish it had been taller but they would have had to raise the price. I think it&#39;s a bargain for $100 and I was able to pick up the other two at $80 and that was awesome. It has plenty of &nbsp;play features but just displays extremely well!! Whether on a shelf or between an ocean and buildings, it looks great.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I believe my previous paragraph sums it up but I think this is an awesome set. The only other thing I would improve would be the width but that also be fixed if needed. I just wanted a bridge going throughout the background of my city and have been elated to have three of the four needed for that effect. It looks amazing and I recommend it.</p>

"dedenbach2011","2016-10-25T21:43:41.693Z","Could be one of the best sets ever...","<p>Bold statement, I know.&nbsp; But we own a lot of superhero sets and this one just seems to be the cream of the crop.&nbsp; It simply looks amazing on display and has endless possibilities for play.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Awesomeness:</strong>&nbsp; The bridge itself is stunning.&nbsp; Yes, it is just part of a bridge but that doesn&#39;t take away from it&#39;s beauty.&nbsp; The base of the bridge is two rooms.&nbsp; There is a trap door on the bridge that falls into one of them.&nbsp; Each room has little details and builds in it.&nbsp; You can bust through the road signs on the one side and launch garbage cans on the same side.&nbsp; The tower part of the bridge has a net that pops down for Kraven the Hunter to catch stuff and the very top of that has a little space for Green Goblin to perch upon.&nbsp; There is just lots of detail in this set and the creators did a fantastic job at recreating&nbsp;a New York City bridge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We have used this set to tie in all of our other Spiderman sets we own.&nbsp; This bridge will truly complete any city type scenes or battles you want to create.&nbsp; You can also see in the picture all of the little builds that come with it like the awesome yellow taxi and Kraven&#39;s little four wheeler.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs:</strong>&nbsp; It may seem obvious, but this is a virtual goldmine for mini figs.&nbsp; Unfortunately Spiderman is the same spiderman you get in every other set, but the rest are totally rad and exclusive to this set.&nbsp; Spiderwoman and Scarlet Spider look great and it is always welcomed to have more spidey characters in the Lego world.&nbsp; It is also so cool to get an Aunt May.&nbsp; We love having civilians to make our battles interesting.&nbsp; Kraven is top notch and has a cool looking animal scarf thing on, green goblin is very detailed with printing on his arms and his glider, and scorpion is new with a sweet back piece.&nbsp; It is minifig heaven.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Well... </strong>this set is absolutely worth the money.&nbsp; I was lucky enough to get a little sale on ours and didn&#39;t have to fork out the 100 it was usually going for.&nbsp; The bridge is stunning and very versatile for playing or for MOCs.&nbsp; It will be a beast either on display or for play.</p>

I know, a&nbsp;very strong thing to claim about any lego set, but I think you will find that it is true. Read on to find out if you agree.</p>

<p><strong>Box and Instructions:</strong>&nbsp;Just your typical $100 set box. The front has an overall image of the set while the back shows some of the many play features.&nbsp; The instructions come in a bag along with a very large sticker sheet to my disappointment. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts: </strong>There are 1092 pieces in the set. Included are&nbsp;a&nbsp;very good variety of web pieces &nbsp;including strands, traditional web pieces, a web net, and the new spray web part. The new web piece was larger than I expected. It is attached to a transparent &#39;ring&#39; piece. The new web piece is&nbsp;great for both play and display.</p>

<p><strong>The Build: </strong>It took me about two and a half hours to build this and it was very enjoyable. There were many stickers to apply, to my disappointment. Some of these I felt were unnecessary and should&#39;ve been left out.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs: </strong>This set includes&nbsp;7 minifigs,&nbsp;most of which are new.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spiderman: </strong>The only non exclusive minifig in the set, Spiderman is the same as always. He is equipped with the new web piece.</p>

<p><strong>Spider Woman:&nbsp;</strong>I was quite pleased when I found out that Lego&nbsp;would be making a spider woman minifig. She did not disappoint. The hair piece fits the minifig quite well and the torso print is excellent.</p>

<p><strong>Scarlet Spider:&nbsp;</strong>Scarlet spider is probably my least favorite minifig in the set. He is still an excellent minfigure overall, but lacks detail. I do like the print on his arms and the hoodie. I wish he had a different face then the same one as spider woman.</p>

<p><strong>Aunt May: </strong>Aunt May has superb detail on her torso and her facial expressions are excellent. I also love the hair piece used for her as I think it looks great. The only possible improvement I could find would be to add printing to the leg.</p>

<p><strong>Scorpion: </strong>I was really excited to see scorpion making an entrance to the Lego world. I was only slightly disappointed by the minifigure. I love the torso printing and facial printing. I really wish that the printing from the torso continued down onto the legs since it looks kind of odd without it. The tail is really neat and it looks great. I would have liked to have seen it be able to move, but I know that would make it really bulky and extremely unbalanced. Overall though and excellent minifig.</p>

<p><strong>Kraven&nbsp;the Hunter: </strong>Kraven&nbsp;is my second favorite minifig. The printing is excellent. I love the paw prints on his legs. His torso printing is superb! It&#39;s exactly like it is in the comics. The fur piece he wears around his neck looks amazing as well. The face piece is the same one used on Vic Hoskins from the Jurassic world sets. I think there could have been a better choice for the face, but it doesn&#39;t look to bad. The hair piece also looks excellent and fits Kraven&nbsp;perfectly. He comes armed with a spear and a gun. I think a crossbow would have been a better choice than the gun as it&#39;s more Kraven&#39;s&nbsp;style. Overall another excellent figure.</p>

<p><strong>Green Goblin: </strong>My favorite minifig in the entire set, Green Goblin is amazing. I love the duel molded legs and the torso printing is amazing. He has spikes that have been printed on his arms. These were a nice touch. He has two facial expressions: angry and laughing. These fit him very well and I couldn&#39;t have asked for better. I love his hat piece as well. He comes with a bag that hangs on his side and a pumpkin bomb that uses the same flame top as used on Ghost Rider. Overall, I don&#39;t think this figure could possibly be improved.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This set has some great minifigures, but the bridge is even better. But before we get to that, lets look at the other little builds. First we have a standard green trash can and some flames. These help show the destruction happening on the bridge. Next there is a little police ATV similar to the one from 5003084 The Hulk polybag from 2015. The ATV can be torn in half and used to throw at someone if you so desire. I wish that the back of the ATV had a handhold for minfigs to grab on to. A police officer would also have been nice, but this is a minor complant considering the minifg&nbsp;selection is marvelous already.&nbsp;Overall it&#39;s a nice mini build.</p>

<p>Next we have Green Goblin&#39;s Glider. As he is rarely seen without it, his goblin glider is included in the set. In my opinion, the glider is the perfect combination between light and bulky. The stud shooters provide extra fire power which is nice. You could take them off if you so desire, but I think they look nice. There is a flame on the back to represent the engine. This looks great as it gives the impression that it&#39;s actually moving. This is great for display and play. This is by far the best version of the glider to date.</p>

<p>Also included is a yellow taxi cab. The taxi is four studs wide, which is the standard city vehicle width. I&#39;m disappointed that there is only room for one minifig and that there is no driver included. There is a radiator grill on the front and stickers that say taxi on them&nbsp;on the hood, sides, and top. I like the wheels used as they contrast really well with the yellow color scheme. I love the rear as well as it looks really great with the number plate, tail lights, and bumper. I do like the sticker of the taximeter on the dashboard. It has the number $13.10 on it. Overall the taxi cab has a superb level of detail on it and evn though I have some minor complaints, I still love the taxi cab and wouldn&#39;t mind having more.</p>

<p>Now on to my favorite part of this set (and also the main reason why I bought it) The Bridge! There are many play features incorporated into this set which we will get to as we go. The size of the bridge did not disappoint me at all. If anything, it was better than I expected. It measures 44cm long and 33cm high if you go form the base to the top of the flagpole. This is great as it is, but the detail is amazing! The bricks used to add texture work really well and also look great. There are also plenty of spots to attach your minifigs.&nbsp;I can only imagine the amount of time it took choosing all the different bricks to use for this set.</p>

<p>The end of the bridge is made to look broken. This is done by having exposed beams and pipes as well as a rough edge that represents wrecked pavement. The first play feature is a little catapult that is disguised as destroyed tarmac. The catapult can launch the green trash can or the flames if you so choose. If you want to, you can easily remove the catapult which might improve the overall appearance&nbsp;of the bridge. The catapult is the weakest play feature in my opinion as it can be hard to use. This is due to the fact that your shot can be blocked by the road signs above it. Luckily this can be easily fixed, which leads us to the second play feature.&nbsp;The signs can be broken apart, perhaps by Green Goblin flying his glider through them,&nbsp;and bent down in either direction. The signs show the way to the airport, the downtown area, and the Daily Bugle which is where Peter Parker works. There is also a highway number 25 which is route 25. This route eventually leads to&nbsp;Hell&#39;s Kitchen, the home of Daredevil! I love the references that the designers put in to the Marvel sets as it shows how much effort they put in to making these sets.</p>

<p>There are many black tiles throughout the bridge, some of which have stickers with cracks on them to represent damage. Some of these are probably better left off as they take away from the overall figure of the bridge. A little bit away from the edge of the bridge is a trapdoor which is our next play feature. This is activated by pulling a little ta on the side of the bridge. The trapdoor leads into one of the pillar supports. This support is surrounded by webs on both sides. These act as a prison to trap any villains who are unfortunate enough to walk&nbsp;over&nbsp;it. On one of the webs is Peter Parker&#39;s camera. I love this little added detail as it works perfectly! On each side of the pillars is a sticker with a reference on it. The first one has the initials `P.P + G.S.` with a heart around it. This is a reference to the romance between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy. On the other side is a poster of Scorpion along with some graffiti art saying `which one is which?` This can only be a reference to the Clone Saga which stars Ben Reilly A.K.A Scarlet Spider. The other pillar has a wanted poster for the Green Goblin that features a minifigure scale height depiction of him. There is also a newspaper article from the Daily Bugle with the headline `Spider Menace Threatens City`. On the other side is the last of the references from the pillars. This one has a newspaper&nbsp;article from the Daily Bugle as well. This one is about Kraven The Hunter. There is also some graffiti art that references the Clone Saga again. This one says `Who is the clone?`. This pillar holds the hideout of Kraven&nbsp;The Hunter. The outside of one side has&nbsp;a ladder that leads up to the bridge. This can be flipped up to reveal a computer that&#39;s tracking Spiderman. There is also a weapon rack for his spear and gun. The other side has a lattice wall that can be pulled out very easily, perhaps by attaching some web fluid and pulling it off the studs it stands on. Behind the wall is a crate with some jewels in it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back up on top of the bridge, there is another play feature. This one is between the two supports and is my favorite play feature in the set. There is a little section of wall that bends out as if a vehicle crashed into it. Luckily there is a web piece to catch the vehicle so it doesn&#39;t go plunging into the river. This is very well hidden as the only signs of it are some swerve marks from a sticker and the hinge pieces used to connect it to the rest of the bridge.</p>

<p>Now we move on to the tower. There are 3 play features here. The first is the walls. These can be exploded by some mechanisms that are surprisingly well hidden.&nbsp;On each side of the mechanism are one red and one green stud. These could represent lights used to conduct traffic. When exploded, the wall separates into two separate pieces. The function is the same as used in the Superhero Airport Battle set. In the middle of the top, there is a tile printed with the year 1962. This is the year the Spiderman comics were first made! &nbsp;Yet another great detail added in by the Marvel team! The next play feature is a little piece on the side that you can put one of the web warriors in. You can then attach one of their web fluid pieces to the bridge. There is a mechanism used to push them off the piece and send them swinging down into the battle. Finally&nbsp;the last play feature in the set is at the very top. There is a web net mechanism that is activated by pushing down on a flag with Green Goblin&#39;s face on it. This then drops a web net onto a villain who is walking under the tower. This feature can be hard to use since if done wrong, it doesn&#39;t work properly.&nbsp;Also on the top is a nest with a couple of eggs. This is probably a reference to the Vulture from 76059 Doc Ock&#39;s Tentacle Trap. To tie the set together, there are some suspension cables that connect to the bottom of the bridge by the signs. At the very back of the bridge is a technic beam that is supposed to be used to combine two bridges together! I plan on buying another bridge sometime in the future to connect them together.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong>This is a spectacular set which has some great minifigures and an even better model, something that can be hard to find in Lego&nbsp;sets these days.&nbsp;I picked this up at a Walmart for $78.00, which definitely made it worth the money. Even if I had to get it for 100$, it would still be worth every penny. For those of you who just buy sets for the minifigs, consider getting it for the bridge. It&#39;s excellent! This set is a must have for any Marvel fan, just for the minifigs alone. This is also a great addition to any Lego city, although you might want to leave most of the stickers off. I cannot recommend this enough! It is such an amazing set! I can&#39;t think of any other Marvel set that matches the level of detail and satisfaction that this has brought me. Therefore I still stick to my claim that this is the best Marvel set yet.&nbsp;I hope this review has helped you with your decision of whether or not you should get this set.&nbsp;</p>

"Tediousity","2016-12-31T01:36:05.483Z","Best Set I Own","<p><strong>Minifigs:</strong></p>

<p>Spider-Man: This was my first, but he&#39;s been the same for years, so nothing new.</p>

<p>Spider-Girl: Kind of plain, but a nice figure overall to have.</p>

<p>Scarlet Spider: Detailed torso with the hoodie piece in blue, plus web-slingers on his wrists.</p>

<p>Aunt May: A good representation of Aunt May in my opinion, but I have one complaint: her alternate face is a terrified, screaming one. Judging from the comics, I would much prefer a disapproving look, as Aunt May rarely is terrified.</p>

<p>Kraven&nbsp;the Hunter: A pretty figure with leopard pants and a cool fur collar.</p>

<p>Scorpion: Kind of plain, but the outfit is kind of plain anyway, so this is a good representation. However, the stinger is solid and inflexible, which bothers me.</p>

<p>Green Goblin: A wonderful figure better than the other two currently on the market. He has two detailed faces (angry and happy), and we&#39;ll get to his glider later.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The new web spray pieces work quite well, and there are two in this set. There are also two web ropes, a white net (more web), and a multitude of plain web pieces. Also of note is the several dark red 1x4 plates with two studs, which make up the ropes.</p>

<p><b>Overall:</b></p>

<p>A wonderful set packed with functions, easter eggs, and detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Functions: 1.) Pushing down on the Green Goblin flag releases the net underneath. 2.) Pulling a tab on one side releases a trapdoor to send a villain into Spider-Man&#39;s lair, complete with camera. 3.) A trash&nbsp;can&nbsp;is able to be catapulted&nbsp;from one side of the bridge. 4.) One section of wall is hinged and the taxi cab is able to partially fall out of the hole it leaves, but there is an attached web to halt it. 5.) Standing a minifigure on one specified part of the tower makes them able to be flung by pushing a knob. 6.) In Kraven&#39;s lair, a web rope can be attached to the wall and then pulled to break it down. 7.) Twisting a knob will bust out the walls of the tower.</p>

<p>Also the ATV included can be torn in half. (I wasn&#39;t sure whether to count that.)</p>

<p>This set is fantastic. It is packed with detail, is large, sturdy, and full of functions, and I have only two problems with it: a), Aunt May&#39;s face, and b), there is no taxi driver included. However, those are minor concerns and I would recommend this to anyone who is a superhero fan or just likes bridges.</p>
