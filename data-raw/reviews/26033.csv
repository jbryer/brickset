<p>Great building experience as the Mixel team gave a lot of life to a dumpster of all things.&nbsp;Ok parts used for the build of Gobbol.&nbsp;Good playability from the wheels as legs, or the mouth opening and being able to store objects inside.&nbsp;This leads to a good value in $5, which is a shame as &quot;Mixels&quot;&nbsp;had excellent Mixels nearing the end of its run.&nbsp;</p>
