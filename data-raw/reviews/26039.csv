<p>The building experience was very uninteresting as Screeno is very blocky compared to his show counterpart, which is still blocky, but not overdone. The parts are also meh, which is disappointing for a character that&#39;s a television. The playability is also disappointing as there&#39;s nothing to do besides moving Screeno&#39;s tiny arms. The value is disappointing as not even Screeno&#39;s entire screen is finished! Only halfway up of Screeno&#39;s face is covered by a screen.</p>
