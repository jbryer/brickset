We also paid 23 euro for it and thats an oke price (still a lot of money for prefabricated pieces of plastic in a cardboard box). Missed the nice lego container but still it's a lot of bricks. 140 pieces 
4x 16 noppen red,yellow,green and blue
8x 12 noppen red,yellow,green and blue
92x 8 noppen red,yellow,green and blue
36x 4 noppen red,yellow,green and blue
The long bricks are the best but there aren't many of them in the boxes, mayby lego should just make a box of the long bricks. I would buy it (for the right price). Still this box delivers what its ment to. A lot of bricks for hours of fun.
