<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://files.slack.com/files-tmb/T0H9CBAJZ-F0MJ6A65P-acfbc6f8c8/slack_for_ios_upload_720.jpg"" style=""width: 720px; height: 720px;"" /></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in a small foil packet, selotaped&nbsp;onto the front of the LEGO Star Wars magazine, it is very easy to open and not protected, meaning someone could easily enter and steal it. But the pieces do not come in a small bag inside the foil themselves, meaning it would get a bit messy and it is sometimes difficult getting the pieces out of the foil. At first I was confused, as a small folded instruction booklet did not come in the packet, but the instructions were on a page in the magazine itself.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set contains 37 pieces, mainly small. The biggest piece has to be a 1 x 6 brown plate which I&#39;ll talk about in &#39;The completed model&#39; section. It comes with no spare parts or any unique parts.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was easy but the instructions in the magazine were cramped onto one A4 sheet landscape-wise. It was quite difficult to see, for me at&nbsp;least.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The build does not look like 37 pieces, but it sure is. It makes real good use of flat and smooth surfaces along with vent pieces around the edges to really give it Luke&#39;s Landspeeder feel. The 1 x 6 brown plate give the build elevation, but sticks out like a saw thumb so I actually ended up removing it myself. The set uses transparent cheese slopes for the cockpit and it works perfectly, one of my favorite parts of the tiny build. It has no playability functions, which I personally prefer myself, as I don&#39;t actually &#39;play&#39; with my models. Also, making the build accurate to the movie, the designer has actually decided to make the left engine/jet thing chrome instead of the maroon color, accurate to Luke&#39;s Landspeeder as it is a different engine in the film.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I really enjoy the look of the set, again, after I remove the brown 1 x 6 plate on the bottom. I hope to pick up next months magazine if possible, which contains a miniature Naboo N-1 Starfighter. If you see these magazines, pick them up!</p>
