Given the number of sets in the series, it seems like all but the roller coaster are on the small set. For the others, this hasn&#39;t been an issue, but this one could have benefited from some expansion.</p>

<p>The cotton candy cart is a nice touch, and I was impressed with how nice the treats look. The ticket booth is less interesting- there&#39;s not really much to it and it seems unnecessary (why do the bumper cars require a ticket but the top spin ride and spaceships don&#39;t?)</p>

<p>The bumper cars themselves were somewhat disappointing. The area is pretty small for the two cars, and only having two cars makes for pretty sad bumper cars anyway. I would have liked to see this expanded to be a real center feature. I do give credit to the design, though, as the cars slide around pretty smoothly.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the best feature of the set is the top spin ride. With the controversy associated with a lot of the &quot;girl-oriented&quot; attempts, it&#39;s nice to see a build that requires gears and has some added function. Technically, it doesn&#39;t function like a true top spin (because this wouldn&#39;t actually be possible- I tried,) but it&#39;s a good imitation. It looks nice and runs well. The restraint bar is a nice touch, and I love that the figures stay in place while hanging upside down.</p>

<p>Overall, I think more effort could have gone into this one- for a set called &quot;Bumper Cars&quot; the actual bumper cars seem like more of an afterthought. What that portion is missing, however, is balanced out by how nice the other ride is, and all things considered I&#39;m happy with this set.</p>
