"UKBRiCKS","2016-05-31T14:57:18.47Z","Very good but not fantastic!","<p>This highly anticipated set does not disappoint with its more neutral colour style and awesome School Bus.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Box/Instructions</h2>

<p>The front of the box shows the performance in Heartlake City with the school bus parked up to the side. Andrea, Noah and Iva are all outside with the sets accessories jamming away to their latest performance school hit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions come in two booklets. One for the School Bus and One for the Performance School itself. Easy as always to follow!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>With 774 pieces for &pound;69.99 it is inline with other LEGO Friends releases however I would expect this to be discounted by 20% to 30% in the coming months. There are some pieces in this set, the watermelon tile piece for me is the stand out new piece. Although it is small it is very unique. We also get the 2016 hot dog bun too.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minidolls</h2>

<p>Andrea has a bright orange skirt with white vest and purple halter neck top, Noah comes with Dark Red sweat pants, a white vest and sand green hoodie. A new minidoll Iva comes with the striking azure blue skirt and lavender top. It would have been nice to get one or two more minidolls in this set. I find myself often saying that with LEGO Friends sets.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The build took about 1 hour and 15 mins, overall it was a straight forward build. It felt very similar to Olivia&#39;s and Emma&#39;s House and also very similar to the hotel albeit with less features inside. LEGO Friends sets have often had a striking colour scheme and this is much more neutral and the LEGO Friends traditional colours are toned down for this set. When you complete the model you feel like the build should have taken a little longer.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The completed model</h2>

<p>First look the final built model looks equally as impressive as the box art however when you get closer up to the set and explore the inside I was left under whelmed by the number of features and the also the lack of detail in those features as well. It would have been nicer to get 100+ more pieces and slap an extra &pound;5/&pound;10 on the set to make the inside better. The School Bus however is the highlight for me, something we do not see often enough (or at all) in the LEGO city theme. The colours are striking and in-keeping with the LEGO theme. If I was putting this into my LEGO city I would swap out the lavender pieces for black to give it a more realistic look.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall opinion</h2>

<p>You cannot fault the set overall for the target market, girls will love this and fellow LEGO Friends collectors and fans will enjoy the build and the features in this set. I am please the colours are not as striking as other LEGO Friends sets so you can incorporate more easily with other scenes and buildings.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Score</h2>

<p>I would give this a good 79/100, not quite fantastic but very good!</p>

<p>My wife did a build review video if you are interested seeing more of the build&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY9HrshsnNE"" target=""_blank"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pY9HrshsnNE</a><br />

"Dude45","2017-01-16T08:02:40.527Z","American school with austere appearance","<p>This set, a model of an American school, is only offered by selected retailers. It&rsquo;s appearance deviates significantly from other Friends sets: The structure is flat on the front side and without the decorations usually found on Friends buildings. Granted, schools are often boring architecturally, but this very dry, monotone and symmetric exterior makes it look odd when combined with other Friends sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The inside is flat as well and quite empty. However the emptiness is quite refreshing;&nbsp;most Friends buildings are so crammed with items and furniture that there is virtually no play space for the mini-dolls, but here you have ample space to play around. And although there are lots of loose items which no doubt will become victims of the vacuum cleaner, thankfully they are fewer than normal.</p>

<p>The yellow school bus is a very nice build but serves to reinforce the view that the Friends range is targeted at U.S. consumers, as this type of bus is a common sight in America but rarely seen in Europe or elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three mini-dolls for an entire school is disappointing. Where are the teachers, the bus driver or other students?</p>

<p>I can see why people have given this set lukewarm or negative reviews. It&#39;s useful for play, especially as there is some space for it, but the exterior and structure is too austere to fit with other sets. To make matters worse, the styling is very American which makes it less interesting for non-U.S. customers. Being a overpriced set, only consider buying this if you can find it heavily discounted.<br />
