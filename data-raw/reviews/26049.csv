"TK_1308","2016-12-19T16:35:34.907Z","""That's a lot of noise for two people supposedly blending in.""","<p>Lego releases its first wave of Rogue One sets with the Imperial Assault Hovertank</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>A deep rectangular box, slightly larger than the standard ones for the &pound;30 range. The figure of choice on top is Chirrut Imwe wither the two Hovertank Pilots displayed in a separate panel. The front shows the Hovertank in the battle on Jedha. The back shows the tank in a similar battle situation with 6 panels showing the play features of the kit.<br />
There is one wide rectangular instruction book.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The price per piece is average for this size kit. The majority of the pieces are light and dark grey with a smattering on dark sand and orange thrown in.<br />
There are 4 bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains the forward cockpit hull and Chirrut Imwe.<br />
Bag 2 contains the forward panel for the cockpit and the port side repulsar tread and cannon assembly.<br />
Bag 2 contains the forward panel for the cockpit and the starboard side repulsar tread and cannon assembly and the two Imperial Hovertank Pilots.<br />
Bag 4 contains the cargo bed for the back and the cargo module.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The set comes with three minifigures.<br />
Firstly we have two Imperial Hovertank Pilots. The detailing for the torso and legs on the figures is superb. The new helmet design is nicely realised in minifigure form with nice detailing to finish the look. Between them, the have an assault rifle, blaster rifle, compact blaster pistol and electrobinoculars. They both have the generic &#39;angry clone&#39; head.<br />
Secondly, we have my favourite, Chirrut Imwe. His head features a smiling and serious face and the white eyes are a nice touch. The torso detailing is excellent but the figure&#39;s legs are plain. This is because the cloth kama that wraps around them add the detail. He has a clip on his back to hold either his bowcaster or staff. Both weapons are well made.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Total building time, 20 minutes.<br />
The build is very easy with no major issues. A combination of ordinary and Technic pieces allow for the features on the tank and like other vehicles, it uses small clear discs for the wheels so when seen from the side it looks as though it&#39;s floating on the repulsars.&nbsp;<br />
For a small vehicle the designer did pack in the features with rotating cannons, firing missiles and opening panels.<br />
There are no stickers.</p>

<p><br />
The completed model</p>

<p>The Imperial Hovertank is a fantastic kit and a very sturdy and playable piece for both kids and adults. The cockpit can be accessed from opening top and front panels. The interior seats both drivers, although they have to go inside in a reclining position. Sadly there are no controls inside the cockpit.<br />
The upper hull has a mount for the assault rifle if you choose. There are also clips on each side that you can attach weapons or the electrobinoculars to if desire.<br />
The cannons on each side can rotate in a complete arc. Just behind them are two small cogs. When turned, the activate the mechanism inside which allows the missiles to fire from the forward mounted spring loaded launchers.<br />
The aft cargo bay has room for two cargo modules. The module has carry handles at each end and the inside has storage room for a compact blaster and the electrobinoculars.<br />
The Tank measures 14 cm wide (across front turrets), 20 cm long and 8 cm tall from wheel base to the top of the rifle mount without rifle.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>A nice addition to any Imperial ground force, the Hovertank captures the look and feel of the vehicle nicely. A great selection of minifigures, very sturdy, driveable and with a fair few features, this set is a must.</p>

"CC_2224","2017-03-17T06:36:22.603Z","It's Beautiful","<p>Comparable to the First Order Snowspeeder, the Imperial Assault Hovertank&nbsp;is a medium priced set from the first wave of a Star Wars movie. This set looks very good and is accurate to its movie counterpart. All the minifigures in this set are impressive, Chirrut Imwe looks identifiable and has good accessories. The pilots look unique to other soldiers, but are still&nbsp;uniform to how the empire should be. The actual hovertank has lots of storage space and an easily accessible cockpit with room for 2 figures. One very nice part about this set is that the spring loaded shooters are not fired on a hair trigger and are harder to lose. The build was short and engaging,&nbsp;and the parts are nothing out of the ordinary, but they make the set look nice. It is an excellent set and I am happy with its low PPP for it being a Star Wars set.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2017-05-31T22:57:58.56Z","Solid Tank Set at Solid Price is One With the Force","<p>The first 2016 wave of&nbsp;<em>Rogue One</em>&nbsp;sets is perhaps one of my favorite set waves ever; and the&nbsp;<em>Imperial Hovertank&nbsp;</em>is a prime example of all that I loved about this wave. The real prop used in the film was a modified&nbsp;Alvis Stormer&nbsp; flatbed armored vehicle, so this set does double duty as both a Star Wars set and a rare glimpse at what Lego would do if they were making modern military sets.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><em>Imperial Hovertak Pilots</em></p>

<p>These two figures are great army builders which blend in nicely with the other imperial forces. The printing on the figure is crisp and clean. The new helmet is shared with the Shoretrooper figure, and as I said previously its shape reminds me of the EOD helmet from the&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>&nbsp;video game series. My only complaint is the lack of dual molded legs or arms for the figure, a&nbsp;rare sight in the Star Wars theme but becoming increasingly common in other Lego lines. I think dual molded arms and legs would have given the figures&#39;s armor more segmentation, suggesting the mobility needed to wear armor inside a small cramped tank cockpit. Other than that issue&nbsp;though, these figures are bordering on perfection.</p>

<p><em>Chirrut Imwe</em></p>

<p>Chirrut was one of the most memorable characters of the film. The blind warrior-monk who was faithful to The Force was memorable in part due to Donnie Yen&#39;s performance and that repeated mantra, &quot;The Force is with me and I am one with The Force.&quot; The Lego figure is an astounding reproduction, and it is great that it was available in one of the cheapest sets of the line. The cloth elements, the torso print, and the custom weapon builds all come together to create a faithful replica of the film character. This figure would have made the set a must buy on its own!</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Due to the horizontal nature of the hovertank, much of the build is stacking plates and bricks on top of each other. There is not much technically going on in the base build other than a simple geared mechanism to fire the spring loaded shooters hidden in the front of the tank. The most impressive build aspect is the SNOT methods used to add &quot;grilles&quot; to the front and back frames ot the tank. The build for the orange container crate is also fun, although it is short and simple.</p>

<p><strong>Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>The crisp lines of the real life Alvis Stormer, and the prop features that were added to it in the film are all accurately replicated in the Lego model. The Lego set looks stark and utilitarian like many of the Empire&#39;s most memorable vehicles, its low riding profile giving it a realistic military look. The only flaw is the tank lacks the treaded wheels the film prop had instead using hidden clear plastic wheels to make it hover. This isn&#39;t much of a noticeable flaw though, as the treads in the film aren&#39;t very well exposed; and a non-treaded actual &quot;hovertank&quot; version of this vehicle was featured in the Han Solo comic. There really is no way to easily recreate the vehicle treads either at this scale, without compromising the look of the model.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it is rather fun to play with. It rolls well, and the spring loaded shooters are well hidden (although their low profile prevents them from firing as far as other spring loaded sets do since their missiles often hit the ground before gaining much distance). The opening tank hatches are fun. The gun mount on the roof is positioned well so one of the figures can easily be posed behind it to man it. The flat surfaces of the vehicle offer additional space for one more orange crate (another identical crate is found in set 75171); but also offer a space for stormtroopers from other sets to stand or sit and &quot;ride&quot; with the tank. Overall, I have very few complaints about this vehicle.</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion</b></p>

<p>The Imperial Assault Hovertank is an example of a small licensed set done right. Three great figures, and a great solid vehicle to boot! No bricks are wasted in extraneous builds, everything is focused together to create one solid toy/model and recreate the Jedha battle scenes from the film. This is a must buy for Lego Star Wars fans, and its low price point makes it an attractive introduction to the Lego Rogue One sets!</p>

"jimjim66","2017-07-11T20:25:48.427Z","Imperial Assault Hovertank","<p>Box/Instructions: Standard Rectangle Box, Now normal action pictures on the back.&nbsp;Instruction book has 78 pages with 133 instruction points.</p>

<p>Parts: 385 pieces spread across 4 Bags. no surprise but most pieces are Imperial Grey, this set has a bright orange storage box to be built on the tank and that really stands out. No Stickers which is a big plus from me,</p>

<p>Minifigures: 3 included in the set, 2 Hovertank Pilots and Chirrut Imwe. The Pilots are new. Helmets are different from other Imperial pilots if you think AT-DP, AT-ST or even AT-AT. Classic White Imperial Armour, Nice detail on the front standard Stormtrooper Clone Trooper head piece (need a new look). Chirrut Imwe when Lego do figures well they do them very&nbsp;well 17 pieces, which include his 2 weapons and his skirt. His head piece shows that he is blind as in the film and has 2 facial expressions.</p>

<p>Build/Complete Model: The build is simple to follow, figures are split in bags 1 and 3, The build starts with the Cockpit, moving onto the side pods and eventually the back with the Orange Storage Box, the design has been well thought off and there are wheels built in which make the tank moverable, and even though you dont see a lot of the tank in Rogue One I think it is represented well. There is plenty of playability, spring loaded missiles are included and well hidden.</p>

<p>Overall Opinion: I do really like this model, and Chirrut has instantly become one of my favorite figures, If you collect Star Wars Lego I think this value will add to your collection, even if it was just for Chirrut, the only down side is Value for Money, and the fact you only get 3 figures in the set.</p>

"BadBricklord","2017-03-19T18:32:08.093Z","LEGO 75152 Imperial Assault ""Hovertank""","<p>I got this set for my birthday back in November prior to seeing Rogue One. It was then on my Lego Star Wars Wish-list&nbsp;and I am very happy to be able to scratch it off the list.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Build:&nbsp;</p>

<p>This sets costs $29.99 and contains 385 pieces. This results in a PPP (Price Per Part) of $.077 or $.08, which is very good. It has a 79 page instruction booklet, 70 or so being&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;actual&quot; instructions or showing off the features. There are 131 &quot;actual&quot; steps, whereas steps 132 and 133 being finishing touches. It comes with 2 spring loaded shooters and thankfully, when loaded, are completely concealed. Firing the &quot;missiles&quot; (or laser bolts, whatever you like to call it) is achieved by turning the knob behind the dual cannon mounting counter-clockwise. The instructions are straightforward, only the &quot;fins&quot; at the end of each tread/repulsorlift being re-built repeatedly. The main cabin superstructure is superbly designed, with room for both hovertank&nbsp;pilots/drivers using SNOT techniques. There is an opening hatch on top with a mounting for a blaster. The cargo bed is recreated using SNOT techniques, but enough studs are retained so that the Kyber&nbsp;Crystal container can remain attached.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs</p>

<p>LEGO never fails to amaze with the amount of detail on their minifigures. You get 2 Imperial Hovertank Pilots and Chirrut&nbsp;&Iuml;mwe&nbsp;with this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One pilot comes with a blaster pistol and binoculars. The other comes with a standard size blaster (I put that one in the mounting on top of the hatch). Both of them have printing&nbsp;on the legs and back. They have a custom badass helmet mold, and it looks awesome. A downside to the pilots&nbsp;is that they come with the standard &quot;angry clone&quot; face.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chirrut&nbsp;&Iuml;mwe is also included in the set. He has printing on the back of his torso but lacks leg printing. I looked over this because he has two faces (a&nbsp;sly grin and a determined (?) expression). Both his staff and light bow are builds. The staff uses two dark-grey&nbsp;light saber hilts and two brown medium length poles (order ground-up: hilt, pole, hilt, pole). His light now uses a blaster rifle with an attachment that has two gold horns. A round 1x1&nbsp;stud gold piece goes on top of that, and a 1x1 brown cone piece tops it off.</p>

<p>Conclusion: This set is a must-have for any Rogue One fans. It looks awesome, and the minifigs&nbsp;look awesome too. For those of you who noticed in the&nbsp;movie that the in-movie vehicle has treads, this vehicle was designed pre-release and the decision to make this vehicle a &quot;proper tank&quot; was made during production. However, there is another variant of this vehicle that is represented in this&nbsp;set (the Hovertank). If you&nbsp;dislike SLS (Spring Loaded Shooters)&nbsp;you can either leave them out of the set, or you can put them in the dual cannons (the central pair lack the muzzles)&nbsp;&nbsp;like I did&nbsp;to create the effect of them firing, although you need two extra bolts to accomplish that.&nbsp;</p>

It has a good amount of pieces and they go together really well to make a pleasingly sturdy build that feels like it could take some toddler abuse and not suffer too much.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not the most visually stunning build in terms of special parts or features but I think it has a real minimal style, just as a piece of military hardware should have.</p>

"dRevan","2017-12-14T16:25:03.05Z","""I'm one with the Force, and the Force is with me""","<p>The inital wave of Rogue One sets had excellent minifigures and excellent builds. The smallest of the wave, Imperial Assault Hovertank has 385 parts, 3 exclusive minifigures and 1 build and retails for $39.99.</p>

<p><strong>Set</strong>:<br />
Lego do not make military vehicles so Lego green-lighting this set was a surprise. The build is extremely sturdy and very heavy. Its mostly bricks being stacked on top of one another. The front has a small 2x2 black tile which would indicate the hatch that opens up. The whole front section can be lifted to access the inside. The top of the tank can be also lifted. It has a small gun turret and a place to stand your figure. On either side are twin cannons and in the centre underneath the cockpit are two more cannons. Integrated well into the build are two missile shooters which are on either side of the cannon at the front. The vertical wing assemblies on either side are sort of pasted on at the end using 1x4 technic brick. The sides are detailed using 1x2 bricks with groove so the build doesn&#39;t look too boring.</p>

<p>The back of the tank is bare save for a couple of tiles and 2x2 jumper plates. There is an orange crate included which goes on the back. The movie featured three crates on the back but you can place only two. Also the second crate is available in the Battle on Scarif set. Moving the crate leaves a very bare look, almost like a pick-up truck type of design.</p>

<p>The underside of the tank has 4 clear technic axles which allow the tank to &quot;hover&quot; on the ground. The idea is nicely executed.</p>

<p>The crate is a fantastic and an ingenious creation. It looks modest and cool and can be recoloured to give a very military-esque look. The inside is very compact but has space for a small pistol and binoculars. There is enough space to put the Death Star plans found in the Battle on Scarif set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong>:<br />
Chirrut Imwe: The figure is a fantasic rebel to my Lego collection. His face captures the essence of the character and his eyes are coloured teal to give the blind eyes look. The skin colour is too white for the character. A more nougat like Baze Malbus&#39;s would be better. His torso is very reusable and comes with a kama skirt piece to go over his legs. He comes with a staff piece which uses the pearl dark grey lightsaber hilt previously available only with Kylo Ren. He also comes with a Bowcaster type of weapon.</p>

<p>Hovertank Pilots: The figures are identical and look like stormtrooper than pilots. The helmet are the new mold used for the Scarif troopers. The printing is so intricate and precise. The torso and leg printing is equally impressive. One of the troopers comes with a blaster and the other with a rifle.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong>:<br />
The set is fantastic. The parts-to-piece ratio is very good and the figure selection is nice. The set could maybe use another figure but its okay. I picked this set up on Force Friday, the day the sets were released, along with the Darth Revan polybag which I felt justified the price.</p>

I'm blind!""","<p>Getting this set for Christmas way back in 2016, I was not amused, probably because I hadn&#39;t even watched Rogue One at the time. However, after I watched the movie, this set became my favorite in my Rogue One collection. The set depicts one of my favorite scenes in the movie, the battle in the streets of Jedha City. It&#39;s retail price was $29.99.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box is the size you would expect from a $30 set, and it has the tank driving through the streets of Jedha. Oddly enough, the box art depicts both Imperial Hovertank Pilots outside of the tank, even though the tank has two pilot seats. The back depicts the play features, like the spring-loaded shooters and the orange Kyber Crystal crate (It doesn&#39;t have any crystals in it though, it&#39;s just a weapon crate)</p>

<p>The instructions are very simple (so simple sometimes that it makes me question the difficulty of the build). It&#39;s just like any other instruction booklet, and it is 80 pages long.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The parts are mostly the same color, Light and Dark Gray, with some Black and Sand Yellow parts scattered around the build. there are no stickers, which is good, but there are also no printed parts which is not so good. Even though the color scheme is predominantly one color, that&#39;s common with most Star Wars sets, especially those that depict vehicles from the Empire.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The <strong>Imperial Hovertank Pilots </strong>are exclusive to this set. One comes with a small blaster pistol and the other comes with a medium blaster rifle. I would have liked for both of them to have come with small blasters, because they&#39;re both pilots, and because its easier to fit in the cockpit. This was probably just done for diversity, though. Both have a helmet, which is just a white recolor of the Shoretrooper helmet. The figures have very detailed printing for the torso and leg pieces, even including what seems to be dirt or sand details in the crevices of the armor. This a quality figure but, the rarity is decreased because there are two of them.</p>

<p><span class=""st""><strong>Chirrut Imwe </strong>is also exclusive to this set. He comes with both a crossbow blaster and a staff. The staff build is fine, but my favorite is the crossbow. It&#39;s nice to see this weapon in a way which isn&#39;t just the crossbow piece or a stud shooter like Chewbacca&#39;s. Chirrut also has an exclusive tunic piece which looks very good, and could be useful for custom figures. My only complaints are the white hand, because Chirrut doesn&#39;t actually wear a glove in the movie (It&#39;s more of an arm brace thing) and Chirrut&#39;s face printing. While it is interesting to see a blind minifigure, Chirrut looks younger than his movie counterpart.</span></p>

<p><span class=""st"">Even though four minifigures would have been too much to ask from a $30 set, I would have liked to see one of the Saw Gerrera&#39;s Partisan Soldiers, since they aren&#39;t included in any sets, or maybe even a normal Stormtrooper, just to have someone else outside the tank.</span></p>

<p><span class=""st""><strong>The build</strong></span></p>

<p><span class=""st"">The build, like I mentioned, is mostly very easy, and it gets a little repetitive when building the symmetric sides of the tank. There isn&#39;t much to say about my building experience other than I enjoyed it, and it was easy, even repetitive at times.</span></p>

<p><span class=""st""><strong>The completed model</strong></span></p>

<p><span class=""st"">The final model is actually larger than I expected, and it is very sturdy. Even though there are spring-loaded shooters, which I don&#39;t enjoy much, there are no stud shooters in this set, which is definitely a pro in my opinion. The front part of the build is odd, especially because there is a mounted gun which doesn&#39;t seem to be there in the movie, and because the interior of the cockpit is not very detailed, only having a few Transparent Red pieces to represent the controls. The cockpit does fit both figures well, though. The back of the build has space for two crates, but the set only includes one. The crates are one of my few complaints about this set. I personally wish there were two crates in this set even if there&#39;s another one included in 75171. It would also have been more interesting if the crates had a Kyber Crystal piece inside it, even if it wouldn&#39;t have had much playability. I also think it would have been interesting to see a few more play features in this set, like maybe having the back pop up or something similar.</span></p>

<p><span class=""st""><strong>Summary</strong></span></p>

<p><span class=""st"">This set is definitely worth the $30, and even though I would like it to have some more play features, or even have the set be more movie-accurate, I still like it, and it is my favorite set in my Rogue One collection, especially because it depicts my favorite vehicle from that movie.</span> If you find this set at a decent price, I would definitely suggest that you buy it!</p>

<p>Happy Building!</p>

"CaptainKindling","2020-09-27T18:48:00.023Z","Great minifigures and a fun model, but not very exciting looking.","<p>With the release of Rogue One, some of the classic Star Wars vehicle such as the AT-ST made a reappearance, but we&#39;re also being treated to a whole set of new design classic-era vehicles, and of course they&#39;re being capitalised on in Lego form.<br />
<br />
To go with the AT-ST on the ground assault side of things, we have the Imperial Hovertank, which falls into the small-medium sized set category. As an adult this build took me roughly one hour, so it&#39;s not the most intricate set in the world, but it&#39;ll be sure to keep younger builders occupied for a good portion of a weekend afternoon!<br />
The set is split across 4 bags, with bags 2 and 3 being mirror builds of eachother, so there is a little repetition here. Unlike some of the larger sets though, this didn&#39;t feel too tedious as these bags were particularly quick to get through. I&#39;m also happy to point out that there are no stickers involved in this set, which will be a relief for most children and a lot of collectors.<br />
Once built it&#39;s a nice sized vehicle, but from a collector&#39;s point of view it&#39;s not a very exciting vehicle to look at. Aesthetically you can see it fitting in as an Imperial workhorse, but it lacks the sense of style which Imperial vehicles such as the AT-AT, TIE Fighter and Star Destroyer pull off so magnificently.<br />
While underwhelming as a display piece though, it&#39;ll be great to play with for kids. The hover function is simulated by four transparent wheels, making it easy to roll around the floor/table, the body of the tank opens up in two places to fit in both Imperial troopers, and the missiles at the front of the tank can be fired by turning the dials on the side of the body. It also features a small supply crate which clips onto the back of the tank, carrying a spare blaster pistol and a set of magnoculars. Altogether it&#39;s a very interactive model.<br />
<br />
On the minifigure front it includes a pair of Hovertank pilots, both of which are very nicely styled. If the tank itself is a little dull, it&#39;s because all of the style went into their armour - quite similar to Return of the Jedi&#39;s scout troopers rather than regular Stormtroopers. On the rebel side of things, it includes a minifigure of Chirrut Imwe - the blind temple guardian. It would have been nice to include him and Baze Malbus together, but he comes with the AT-ST set, so you have to buy both to reunite the pair!.<br />
<br />
In summary - the tank lacks somewhat in style, but has a lot of interactive parts, and the minifigure selection is fantastic. Great set for the price.</p>

"RenoFam","2022-05-30T02:37:46.313Z","Interesting set, some small gaps","<p>After watching rogue one, I looked at all the sets that they sold from the film and was drawn to this hover tank. I was really happy with the mini figures, especially the tank drivers, and was happy with the mini figure for Chirrut Imwe, especially because of the skirt piece he comes with. &nbsp;Overall, the build is almost seamless, with lots of depth along the sides and top, which is surprising because it looks like it would be a very flat area where lego could just skip and move on. However, there are some things I found in unnecessary&nbsp;or&nbsp;annoying. For example, there are three clips and places to put weapons, even though the set comes with two. Also, why does the Kyber transport bike have a gun and binoculars? There are also some small gaps at the opening to the interior that could have been fixed. Overall though, I was happy with the set.</p>
