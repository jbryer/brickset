"brobert","2016-10-03T12:02:13.783Z","A pretty slick chicken","<p>As the significance of the other crafts released in the first wave of RO sets remains to be seen, I was really only interested in this for now. Since I lived my dark ages at the time of&nbsp;the previous releases of this set, and based on the pictures released, it was a no-brainer first day buy for me, it&#39;s a legendary OT vehicle, and a very good representation of the source material.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is pretty much the standard, not too big, but it&#39;s still a bit oversized for the contents.</p>

<p>Usual pictures of the set in the front, and representation of play features on the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instruction manual was surprisingly big for me at first, at this size I&#39;m used to just the small booklets, this has some extra pages for the occasional ads for other products, and of course the overview of this wave&#39;s minifigs and sets.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a small sticker sheet, I know many builders are annoyed by these, but here I think it&#39;s manageable with just 7 stickers if I counted well.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are packed to 3 numbered packages, as the set is a mere 449 pieces. The first package contains the legs and the base of the cabin, the second the &quot;skeleton&quot; of the cabin, and the last one the sideplates.</p>

<p>The legs are mostly built of course with technic parts, while for the other sections there is a fair selection of standard and special plates and bricks, mostly in dark and LBG pieces.</p>

<p>All in all, not a lot of unique or interesting parts as far as I noticed, although Baze&#39;s buildable weapon is a very welcome addition, this is something that stands out of the generic blaster forest.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are only 3 minifigs, which is also pretty standard for a set this size, since we don&#39;t know yet how exactly the vehicle features in Rogue One, it&#39;s hard to decide if anyone is missing for the full experience.</p>

<p>The only preexisting figure is the AT-ST driver, which of course received quite an update since the last version.</p>

<p>The torso paint is not much different as far as I can tell, it is a bit sleeker now, as the stitches&nbsp;are not present anymore,&nbsp;but now the legs are also printed as customary these days. The head painting changed a lot as well, as now the goggles are not printed on the head, but the helmet, which is a nice addition in my opinion. Hence the head paint is the standard double print on both sides with different emotions, with the addition of the helmet strap of course.</p>

<p>The second minifig is Baze&nbsp;Malbus, who is supposedly one of the main characters of the new movie. Unfortunately the hairpiece doesn&#39;t look accurate, it is way too short compared to the promo shots of the actor. The rest of the prints look great though, the character&#39;s armor is nicely represented, the back is also printed for full effect, although the backpack covers most of it. The detailing of the backpack is also pretty nice, as well as the built blaster, which connects to the backpack with a chain element. Clearly Baze&nbsp;doesn&#39;t operate with any kind of standard weaponry in the movie, and his LEGO double doesn&#39;t mess around either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The third minifig is a generic rebel trooper, nothing too fancy here, but the coat and helmet are nice new additions, and I particularly like the light brown detailing and belt on the dark brown legs, his blaster also got a small spin with the extra part at the end of the barrel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In general, I&#39;m quite satisfied with the minifigs, except for Baze&#39;s&nbsp;hairpiece, and&nbsp;maybe an extra imperial trooper could&#39;ve been included,&nbsp;but the balance of forces still tips towards the lone imperial in the AT-ST :)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is not too tricky - at least for AFOLs, it&#39;s doable in around half an hour.</p>

<p>Like I mentioned at the parts, nothing particularly special here, obviously it&#39;s a symmetrical build, but because of the size of the model, it doesn&#39;t have a chance to be too boring.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The end result is very pleasing, as I said in the intro, it&#39;s a fairly accurate representation of an iconic vehicle, even if you are not particularly&nbsp;interested in the new movie (which is hard to believe), it can be employed in a number of OT scenarios, like on Hoth or Endor. The overall shape and stance of the model is instantly recognizable.</p>

<p>The rotating mechanism of the cabin is really neat, and well hidden, and the hatch on top can be opened separately, so the driver can climb out on top, and can also be positioned that way, as he has clamps to hold onto in this position.</p>

<p>It&#39;s by no means a perfect model however,&nbsp;the feet could be improved for example, and the legs&#39; articulation is limited, but in exchange it stands really firmly on them. There&#39;s room for improvement on the cabin part as well, the &quot;eyelids&quot; are not accurate, and the railing on top has to be completed for a movie-accurate look.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>All things considered, I am very happy with this set, and it&#39;s something I would definitely recommend to every LEGO SW fan. Like I said, I missed out on previous models, but looking at pictures, this is most likely the best version of the AT-ST in general. The minifigs&nbsp;are quite alright too, and the pricing also seems fair to me. It is a well made, and affordable addition to any AFOL&#39;s&nbsp;collection, and could also be fun to play with for kids with the great rotating cabin, and spring-loaded shooters on the bottom.</p>

"danbailey","2016-10-03T15:56:36.867Z","Thoughtful Details","<p>I decided that I was going to get a Rogue One set on the first day they were available -- and that the AT-ST was going to be it. &nbsp;Only the minifigs make it Rogue One specific, and I&#39;d been wanting a scout walker for my collection since I was first into Lego as a kid. &nbsp;So yeah, $40 was a reasonable spend (and given that I was about to drop 500x&nbsp;that amount on home repairs only a few hours later, it was the only spend), so I bit the bullet.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Durable box, much smaller than I expected. &nbsp;So much so that I kept overlooking it and was assuming that somehow the Mall of America Lego store didn&#39;t have it in-stock. &nbsp;I was crushed. &nbsp;Then I walked away from the Lego section, noodled around a bit, and then wandered back and put fresh eyes on the shelves, and it jumped out at me.</p>

<p>The instructions are great -- only a single book in this kit, which solves my multi-book pet peeve that I have mentioned in other reviews. &nbsp;Straightforward, simple, and easy to follow. &nbsp;There&#39;s a few times when I thought they were unnecessarily complicated -- why have two separate series for the foot when they&#39;re exactly the same? &nbsp;Just have me build it twice and set the second one aside.</p>

<p>Also, only a precious few stickers. &nbsp;Thank god. &nbsp;I hate stickers. &nbsp;Bring back the screen-printed parts, please.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Bear in mind that I&#39;m an AFOL that came back to Lego for the third time in late 2016, so my reaction to some of these parts was akin to, &quot;Where have you been all my life?&quot; &nbsp;So many things I could have used these for back in the late 90&#39;s! &nbsp;Or my first stint with Lego back in the 70&#39;s/80&#39;s. &nbsp;Great mix of Technic parts and structural pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Awesome. &nbsp;I can leave out the two Rogue One guys and mix the AT-ST with any other Ep. 4-6 sets and it&#39;ll be just like a Star Wars movie. &nbsp;My only issue is with the Rogue One rebel trooper -- a minifigs pants should never match their skin tone without some sort of pattern printed on. &nbsp;Otherwise it just looks like a &quot;honey where are my paaaants?&quot; series crossover.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Great fun -- my four year-old helped me with the first leg, but while we were doing that, he also sorted all the parts by color and type (hooray OCD!). &nbsp;We ran out of time before his bedtime, so we got through the construction of the first leg together. &nbsp;Involving a preschooler is always a sure-fire way to slow things down, and by the time we were finished with the first leg, he was trying to convince me to save the rest for a joint effort. &nbsp;I was too into it to wait, and finished up without him.</p>

<p>None of it is so complicated that an AFOL&nbsp;or a 12-year old will have any issues with it. &nbsp;I certainly wouldn&#39;t buy it for a 5-year old unless I wanted to do most of the build myself.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Awesome. &nbsp;I&#39;ve always been worried about the possibility of AT-STs falling over on their face, but this one is sturdy and well-balanced, and I&#39;m pretty pleased with how it came out. &nbsp;Like the other same-era Star Wars models, it has a few little details that make for a very cool model. &nbsp;The &quot;shooters&quot; (preschooler terminology) have hidden triggers, similar to the way the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75105-1/Millennium-Falcon"">Millennium Falcon</a> (75105) or <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75082-1/TIE-Advanced-Prototype"">TIE Advanced Prototype</a> (75082) do, and the knob on the rear to make the head turn left and right is a welcome function. &nbsp;Using a ratcheting turntable to mount the head was a great idea -- keeps the head from swiveling unexpectedly.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great kit for the price -- the Lego folks hit it out of the park on this one. &nbsp;I can&#39;t say for certain, as I haven&#39;t played with any of the other Rogue One kits, but I have a feeling that this might be the best bang-for-the-buck kit of the group.</p>

"Sobel","2017-01-08T16:56:28.67Z","Super realistic set, but little usability","<p>The last AT-ST-model I had was the very first one from 1999 with Chewbacca inside. So for me, this was a quantum leap in design and SIZE!!! Well, also in price, but as we know, all Star Wars-models are rather expensive. This one came at 45&euro; which is OK for SW-set this size.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The model comes with standard LEGO bricks and lots of Technic parts like most current SW-models. Nothing too special, but some parts, like the joints for the legs, are quite interesting and could also be used very well for other purposes.<br />
Funny sidenote: Who would&#39;ve guessed what a LEGO-hammer could be used for...?<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The set includes three minifigures, which is good for a medium sized set. As always, the figs are very detailed and come with some weapons and special gear. The Baze Malbus minifigure is OK and features a heavy blaster and a backpack. The rebel trooper has a special blaster and the AT-ST pilot a small gun and a thermal detonator.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>It starts off with the base platform (torso?) which carries the &quot;head&quot;. Then, each leg is build individually and attached to the &quot;torso&quot; with lots of links, so it has a good steadiness. After this, the &quot;head&quot; is build and attached to the &quot;torso&quot;. I liked how both of the side parts of the &quot;head&quot; are set in place slightly sloped, so they give it the realistic look!<br />
All in all, the build is nothing too special, took me around 30-40 minutes due to all the small parts and the little room I have to spread out wen building LEGO! ;-)</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>As stated before, it looks REALLY cool, just like in the movies. It has so much detail with all the joints and gears in the legs, the shape of the &quot;head&quot; and its interior. I was also surprised by how tall the model is when finished. In regard to the minifigures, I guess it has quite a realistic scale!<br />
On the downside, it has no real functions except the double blasters and the rotatable &quot;head&quot;. The legs can only be bent backwards at one joint. There ist no real &quot;walking&quot; function as the old model from &#39;99 had. It is also not possible to have it standing in more than one position.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This model is very good for presentation and setting up a cool and realistic Star-Wars-scenario. Its design is very realistic and, just because of the size, it looks really awesome! The double blasters are nice as always and even have two seperate &quot;triggers&quot;.<br />
On the other hand, the options of playing are very limited. It disappointed me a bit, that the legs are so static and immobile and no real &quot;walking&quot; effect is given. But since I&#39;m an AFOL and most of my models are for presentation and collecting, I can forgive that flaw! ;-)</p>

"TK_1308","2016-12-19T16:34:13.093Z","""We're going to Jedha, that's a war zone.""","<p>Lego releases its first wave of Rogue One sets with the impressive AT-ST Walker.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>A fair sized square box houses the kit. Baze Malbus is the figure of choice on the top with the Rebel Trooper and AT-ST Driver displayed in the panel next to him. The front shows The AT-ST in battle on Jedha. The back features another battle situation and 5 panels displaying the play features.<br />
There is one almost square instruction book.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The price per piece ratio is average for a kit this size. Most of the pieces are light and dark grey with a few blue grey and dark sand coloured pieces thrown in.<br />
There are 3 bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains parts for the main hull, legs and Baze Malbus.<br />
Bag 2 contains parts for the lower head, forward and aft head panels, Rebel Trooper and AT-ST Driver.<br />
Bag 3 contains the parts for the remaining hull panels for the head.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The set comes with three minifigures.<br />
Firstly we have the AT-ST Driver. It&#39;s always nice to have more of these as they are somewhat overlooked as Imperial troops go. His head has smiling and serious faces. The detailing on his torso, legs and helmet are excellent and make for a very nice trooper. He comes equipped with a compact blaster pistol and a thermal detonator.<br />
The Rebel Trooper is another nice figure. The torso details are well done and the markings on the new helmet are good, too. He comes equipped with a blaster but there are enough spares in the set to furnish him with a thermal detonator, too.<br />
Finally we have my favourite, Baze Malbus. His head is well detailed, the beard is nice and the scar under his left eye is present for both is serious and fighting faces . His torso and leg detailing are excellent and nicely portray the costume in minifigure form. His power pack and pulse rifle are well built and look great.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Total building time, 20 minutes.<br />
The build is similar to the last AT-ST Walker that was released so do major surprised in the construction. However, this time the designer has tidied up some parts to make the angles more accurate for a better look. The Walker is very sturdy and displays well. The joints for the legs are similarly well constructed and the balance is quite good.<br />
The level of detail across the whole walker is well done and adds to the overall look.<br />
There are 8 stickers to apply; one for each foot, two for the exhaust vents on the rear main hull, 2 for the panels on the back of the head, the top hatch and the control panel inside.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The AT-ST is an impressive kit and a worthy addition to any Imperial force. Plus, it fits nicely into Endor dioramas as well.&nbsp;<br />
The whole top opens up to allow access to the cockpit which seats one figure. Behind him is a little area to store his compact blaster pistol and thermal detonator. There is a&nbsp;separate top hatch in the roof as well. The front viewing port shields are also moveable.<br />
The head can rotate the full 360 degrees by turning the knob on the back of the main hull. The lower thigh joint in hinged to allow for some poseability at the sacrifice of model stability.&nbsp;<br />
The cannons and mortar launcher are well realised and the ones on each side of the head can rotate the full 360 degrees as well. The chin guns have an approximate 135 degree firing arc.<br />
To either side of the chin guns is a spring loaded missile launcher. These can be activated by pushing sliding levers at the base of the back of the head.&nbsp;<br />
The AT-ST Walker is 13 cm wide (foot base), 16 cm long (chin guns to aft leg stabilisers) and stands and impressive 27 cm tall.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>A great set and one of the nicest versions of the AT-ST to date. Coupled with some great minifigures, this walker is a must have for any collection.</p>

"MrBadger113","2016-10-23T17:52:06.493Z","The Chicken Walker","<p>When I first saw the images for the Rogue&nbsp;One sets the first thing that stood out to me was the AT-ST, as it was the only vehicle in this wave that wasn&#39;t new to the movie. I decided to pick it up because I&#39;m a sucker for walkers of all types and I wanted that Baze Malbus figure.</p>

<h2>Box/Instructions</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;box was a bit smaller than expected and showed the usual; main model on the front, minifigures&nbsp;on the bottom left, and some more features&nbsp;of the model on the back. Nothing too exciting here although there is a new banner that looks very nice with&nbsp;a Death Trooper on the top.</p>

<p>The instructions were surprisingly high quality. Rather than the normal staples that are used to hold the pages together there&#39;s glue, which gives them a very quality feel. It was also nice to see this type of booklet&nbsp;used again as the first time I encountered it on a set that wasn&#39;t Ideas was&nbsp;75094-1: Imperial Shuttle Tydirium. From there on the instructions are just the steps to the build.</p>

<p>There was also a dreaded sticker sheet&nbsp;but there are only 8&nbsp;stickers &nbsp;and they&nbsp;add some nice details to the walker. Even if you don&#39;t put them on the walker still would look good.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>As expected with an Imperial vehicle&nbsp;most of the parts are in grey and light grey. There are also some sand blue pieces scattered around on the &quot;head&quot; of the walker&nbsp;that add some nice detailing and pair surprisingly well with the various shades of grey. &nbsp;There are a few brightly colored pieces used for building up the walker but they are only seen on the inside.&nbsp;Some other interesting or desirable pieces are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The new minifigure rollerskate piece used for detailing&nbsp;on Baze&#39;s gun (comes with two counting the spare)</li>
	<li>Printed Thermal Detonator piece</li>
	<li>Two spring-loaded shooters</li>
	<li>Two of the new &quot;lamp shade&quot; pieces in grey on either side of the head</li>
	<li>Two trans-black 1x1 bricks</li>
	<li>Multiple sand blue plates</li>
	<li>Multiple Technic parts</li>
	<li>Four 2x1 arches with studs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>A main selling point on this set for me was the minigfigures. They are all incredibly detailed and look fantastic.</p>

<p>Baze Malbus: Baze is probably the best out of them all. His torso,&nbsp;leg, and head printing is all very well done and movie accurate. And much like his movie counterpart, he doesn&#39;t mess around when it comes to guns. It&#39;s been a while since we&#39;ve gotten a brick-built gun out of Star Wars and this is thing is just great. It&#39;s faithful to the movie in its appearance and he can actually stand straight while holding it because of his backpack. Speaking of which his backpack/power supply is also well done. The only gripes I have about it are they used a blue Technic&nbsp;pin to attach his gun&#39;s cable when they could&#39;ve easily used a light grey one. Another thing is I&#39;m personally not a fan of the clear piece used to attach the backpack to him. It&#39;s a very useful piece and I just wish they would put it into a solid color. I&#39;ve heard some people don&#39;t like his hair piece but personally I think it&#39;s fine and is the best Lego could&#39;ve done without a new mold. Another thing I should point out is the color used for his flesh is&nbsp;slightly redder in tone&nbsp;than that of the normal flesh. It&#39;s very accurate to the actor who plays Baze&nbsp;and I hope they use it again sometime in the future as it looks great.</p>

<p>Rebel Trooper: For a generic, army-building figure this guy looks amazing. The printing is highly detailed and I believe his helmet is dual-molded, and if it&#39;s not then Lego has upped their printing game.It&#39;s also nice to get a small attachment for the blaster giving it some personality rather than just leaving it blank.</p>

<p>AT-ST Pilot: I&#39;ve never gotten any other form of this minifigure before and I don&#39;t feel like looking up pictures of past ones.&nbsp;I do know enough though&nbsp;that the goggle printing on his helmet is new. Just going on this figure I&#39;d say it&#39;s probably the most accurate version yet. The printing on his uniform gives it a crisp feel and looks all around nice. Both of his faces have a chin-strap printed on that looks as if it attaches to the helmet. He comes with a simple blaster pistol in case of a close quarters encounter.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The build of the AT-ST itself is fairly straight-forward. It took me, a ToFL, around 25-30 minutes to complete it.&nbsp;There weren&#39;t too many twists and turns and it would be relatively easy for someone of the younger demographic to build it. The head was probably my favorite part as the techniques used to get the angles for the side plates was very reminiscent&nbsp;of those used on the&nbsp;2014 AT-AT, a set I love dearly.&nbsp;There was a bit of gear work in the &quot;base&quot; of the walker that allows for the head to swivel with a turn of a knob.</p>

<h2>The completed model</h2>

<p>Once you see this thing standing it becomes clear&nbsp;why it has the nickname &quot;Chicken Walker&quot;. The legs and stance are very similar to that of a chicken. However it is far more intimidating then that of a bird. It towers over minifigures and looks threatening. The cannons on&nbsp;the left side of the head are fairly accurate and can swivel a full 360 degrees. The grenade launcher on the other side is simulated quite well with some sort of Technic ball socket, and like the cannons, can also go a full 360 degrees. The main cannons on the bottom also look good and can move up and down. They&#39;re paired up with two spring-loaded shooters to simulate firing.&nbsp;The shooters themselves have a clever firing mechanism that&nbsp;when a button on the back is pushed a sloped piece pushes the tail end down.&nbsp;The legs sacrificed articulation for esthetic. They look fantastic and are near perfect but unfortunately they only move at the hip and there are really only two positions you can put the legs in so it will stand. The inside cockpit doesn&#39;t have much to offer other than the seat for the pilot and a place to store a Thermal Detonator and his pistol. There is a stickered slope inside it that shows a control panel that is accurate to the Original Trilogy AT-ST. There is also a small hatch on the top that opens up to allow you to poke a minifigure through. One more thing to point out is that if enough light is shown into the cabin you can actually see the pilot&nbsp;in there through one of the view holes which I thought was kind of cool.</p>

<h2>Overall opinion</h2>

<p>This is a grade A set from Lego. The minifigure selection is fantastic and the walker itself is the most accurate representation yet. The only issue is that the legs are barely pose-able but I believe this is justified for how they look. And for only forty dollars you get quite the value. Even if you have no interest in Rogue One, the walker and pilot can be used in any Original Trilogy diorama as they are near-perfect representations of the both the Rogue One and Original Trilogy vehicle and pilot.</p>

"Tediousity","2016-12-27T19:13:14.243Z","Great set but low posability","<p>Overall a pretty good set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>Baze Malbus: Very well detailed, with two faces and a nice gun and backpack. The backpack actually balances the gun so he can stand up straight without falling over.</p>

<p>Rebel Trooper: A very good looking guy: also, he is a BLACK UNNAMED EXTRA CHARACTER, which I was more excited about before realizing that he actually shows up in the movie like this. Still cool though.</p>

<p>AT-ST Pilot: This guy is a step up from previous pilots with printed goggles on his helmet, pretty wrinkles on his torso and legs, and two faces.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The build was nice for the most part: obviously you have to repeat the legs and sides of the head, but other than that it was very interesting. Doesn&#39;t take too long to build: I built it in about an hour, and that was while watching a movie.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The hinges on the legs are interesting, and the right-hand cannon has a piece I&#39;ve never seen before (but that&#39;s just me). Apart from that, not much new.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>As I said, a pretty good set! There&#39;s a nice function with pushing (almost invisible) knobs at the back to launch hidden missiles from the front. HOWEVER, the legs only bend in one place and it is hard to balance it with any leg bending at all.&nbsp;<br />

"xboxtravis7992","2017-05-31T23:45:56.17Z","Original Trilogy Icon Returns Dramatically to Lego Form","<p>The AT-ST, the &quot;Chicken Walker.&quot; Part of the Original Trilogy, the AT-ST stomped its way into the collective minds of Star Wars fans through its brief cameo in&nbsp;<em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>&nbsp;and its extended presense in&nbsp;<em>Return of the Jedi&nbsp;</em>where Chewbacca and a group of Ewok soldiers hijack the vehicle and use it to capture the Imperial shield bunker. As such it came as no surpise this classic vehicle had a brief role in&nbsp;<em>Rogue One</em>&nbsp;where it was patrolling and fighting in the streets of Jedha City. What is a surprise though is that of all the Original Trilogy designs that resurfaced in Rogue One (X-Wings, Correlian Corvettes, Tie Fighters, Imperial Shuttles, Star Destroyers, etc.) that&nbsp;<em>only&nbsp;</em>the AT-ST would be made by Lego in the 2016 winter wave (the Y-Wing would join it as OT alumni&nbsp;in the Rogue One theme in 2017). With that said, many Lego fans including myself were happy to see the Chicken Walker return to store shelves; as a set to bridge over the new films with the original classics.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><em>AT-ST Pilot</em></p>

<p>The AT-ST pilots in Rogue One are never revealed during the course of the film. While I think it would be safe to assume the pilots in Rogue One would have worn similar armor to their Imperial Assault Tank counterparts; Lego went instead with a classic rendition of the known Return of the Jedi design. The figure is simple, but is faithful to the original saga. In my copy it seemed the black printing on the torso&nbsp;wasn&#39;t as opaque as it should have been, with some of the gray plastic color seeping through. Unfortunate, but not a major issue. The head is double sided and the helmet has a new visor printing on it.</p>

<p><em>Rebel Soldier</em></p>

<p>The rebel soldier costumes from the film reminded me a lot of classic World War II combat&nbsp;fatigues; and this figure is faithful to that. A similar figure can be made from parts in the recent rebel soldiers battlepack, so this figure is not very unique. However the spectacular helmet and the regular appearance help it to be a good addition to anyone building up a rebel army collection.</p>

<p><em>Baze&nbsp;Malbus</em></p>

<p>One of the film&#39;s lead protagonists, Baze is a longtime friend of Chirutt Imwe. While Chirutt remains faithful to The Force, since the Jedi Purge and the Imperial ransacking of the Jedha Temple; Baze has grown skeptical of his own religious beliefs, something he struggles with until the film&#39;s climactic battle. The printing is a great replica of the costume seen in the film. The custom blaster and backpack build adds a lot to the finished look of the figure. My only complaint is the hair piece seems to short; although with the backpack in place I doubt it could be any longer.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>A few fun SNOT methods help to build up the walker, and pieces come together in many surprising and creative ways. A few stickers are used in the build to give the set the detailing it needs to pop out. If I had any complaint it is that the leg builds are almost deceptively detailed for their lack of articulation. All the Technic beams and pins feel like it is leading somewhere, but in the end the set has almost zero mobility or pose-ability. I knew before getting this set that there was only one joint of articulation in each leg, but building the complex yet static leg structure made it hard to forget that issue. Perhaps the integration of CCBS parts could have allowed for more leg joint functions, however admittedly the spartan and static legs do add greatly to the&nbsp;<em>look&nbsp;</em>of the set if not its playability.</p>

<p><strong>Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>The final model looks stunning. The proportions feel &quot;right&quot; and help bring to mind how the vehicle looked in the films. The one man cockpit uses a few sleights of hand to give it more playability. By seating a figure in the central seat, the figure can only be seen from one window at a time. As such depending on the angle it looks as if the figure was actually sitting in an offset seat; like the two seater arrangement seen in the films. Only a straight on look&nbsp;reveals there is just one figure. Two handles near the roof hatch allow the figure to &quot;see out&quot; from the top, again recreating the look from the films. I really wish I had the new Chewbacca figure to see how&nbsp;<em>he&nbsp;</em>looks from that roof hatch! :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>In addition to that the spring loaded missile launchers are well hidden, not detracting from the look of the model. Everything is easily accessible. The head can rotate a full 360 degrees, although that is not screen accurate I can imagine kids having fun spinning the head around.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion</b></p>

<p>The AT-ST is a well rounded set. While the lack of leg articulation is unfortunate, the finished model looks great and captures all the memories of the vehicle I have from the films. The asking price does seem a little to high, and I think it is a far better purchase at $35 or $30 USD than the original price at $40. With that said, I still would recommend it to people looking to add this iconic vehicle to their Lego Star Wars collection.</p>

"CC_2224","2017-07-14T23:16:17.933Z","Excellent AT-ST Playset","<p>The AT-ST designed for Rogue One is an excellent set and has becone one of my favorite overall&nbsp;models in the Star Wars line. It has great action features and although limited in the leg movement, the walker has very good stability. The model is well done and fairly priced in my opinion (Price will vary depending on your location).</p>

<p>I find most sets to have a pleasurable building experience. A large problem I have with vehicle models like the UCS TIE Fighter, is that the build can be very repetative, but because the symmetrical AT-ST Walker is relatively small, I feel the repetative building only adds to the experience.</p>

<p>I do not make large and detailed MOCs (My Own Creations) so I am not really aware of how valuable most parts are. What I can say is the parts that make the set work well, especially for the inside of the walker where there is easy access and an extremely necessary spot for the blaster.</p>

<p>The minifigures in this set have good detail for a medium-small set, they all have appropriate and accurate blasters as well. Baze&#39;s heavy repeater cannon has great detail that is accurate to the story. The small addition to the Rebel Trooper&#39;s blaster is a good choice for extra length and greebling. The issue I have with the figures is the minifigure selection: the AT-ST is an Imperial walker and I feel the set should have been dominated by imperial minifigures.</p>

<p>Most sets only have a few functions, and this inexpensive walker meets the expectations. It has posable legs, the head that turns with a knob at the back, two ways to open the hatch, spring loaded shooters (Which are concealed!), posable blasters on the head of the AT-ST, and a cockpit with an impressive seat, and space for blaster + thermal detonater.</p>

<p>This is a well done set and fits in with the original trilogy movies and of course, Rogue One. It is a staple of any Lego Star Wars collection&nbsp;and would make a great gift for a fan of Star Wars or Lego.</p>

"FlyRobinFly03","2017-07-07T01:27:58.987Z","Best At-St ever!!!!","<p><strong>Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong>First, the rebel lieutenant&nbsp;is probably the worst part of this set. His helmet and torso print is kinda&nbsp;cool, but the face&nbsp;is a generic face and pants are boring. Second, Baze Malbus. He looks great with an exclusive torso print, cool hair, and a pretty cool gun build. Third, At-St driver. He&#39;s probably the best minifigure in this set. I never got an At-St or original trilogy set so he was a welcome editon&nbsp;to my collection. His helmet is great and the torso print is cool and the double sided face is also great.</p>

<p><b>Parts:&nbsp;</b>Their is a lot of cool parts like the circle hinge pieces to make it move. The Death Star plans, and&nbsp;the round things on the turret.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong>&nbsp;I think its a very reasonable price at 39.99 dollars for 450 pieces.</p>

<p><b>Final Build: </b>It looks great and very few technic stuff is shown. It was much larger than expected. The rotating head is very cool while the missiles are just mediocre.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong>&nbsp;This set is wonderful. It looks amazing, it comes with a exclusive minifigure, it has a ton of cool parts, and it has great price. If you see this, buy it or if you see any cause the Rogue One sets are so cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-04-20T07:42:32.213Z","Awesome AT-ST","<p>Picked this one up at a garage sale and it is awesome. It looks just like an AT-ST from the movies. The set is based on Rogue One, but if you want it to be on Endor it will still look perfect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set I got only included the driver minifigure&nbsp;which is simple but looks very nice. I would have liked to have gotten the Baze minifigure, but not a big deal, Endor is a lot more fun than Scarif.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>Build</b></p>

<p>As I&rsquo;m sure you can tell by looking at it, there is a lot of technic, which I like because I don&rsquo;t have to many technic sets. The technic is mainly in the legs, but is also use to connect the side panels. As a result the side panels are a little loose, but they won&rsquo;t fall off and other than a little rattle it doesn&rsquo;t effect play any.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is symmetrical , but it is also small. The legs take a bit of time, but they are complex enough you won&rsquo;t mind building them twice. The side panels are mirrored of course and feel like fairly typical Star Wars builds. You&rsquo;ll race through the second one. The rest of the model is the center, so other than placing two bricks one on either side, there is nothing repetitive about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is fairly straightforward, it was the legs that took me the most time, and I can see them giving young children a bit of trouble (I doubt my 5 year old could build them). But the rest is pretty simple, so your kids can definitely build the upper body.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>There is a lot of technic, and with that a lot of parts I&rsquo;ve never seen before. Beyond that, everything else is fairly standard for a Star Wars set, and there aren&rsquo;t too many small bricks inflating the brick count (they leave that job to the technic pegs)</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>Model</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like I said it looks great. It also seems to be perfectly sized for a minifigure scale. While this is definitely a positive, it does mean that it may be a little large in comparison to other sets that you may have. The details on the upper body are excellent and it includes a hatch on top that a minifigure can stick out of for realistic play. The top also is on a hinge so that you can easily access the interior. It is really only designed for a single minifigure, but you can throw two in loosely or have one sitting inside and another popping out of the hatch. The legs maybe aren&rsquo;t quite as well detailed as the body, but they still look good.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Playability</b></p>

<p>This is the major downfall of the set. The legs only move on a single hinge, at the hips. The knees and feet are rigid so don&rsquo;t expect to see this set posing in realistic walking positions. The hip joint however has a very high degree of friction so the model won&rsquo;t fall down, and you will feel like you are going to break it if you try moving the legs. The other main feature is that the head swivels on the torso, and while you can easily turn it with your hand, you can also turn a dial in the back to rotate the head. This feature works great and I really like it a lot. However if you don&rsquo;t snap everything into place perfectly, then there won&rsquo;t be any friction, perfect connections however will give you all the friction you need.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>I love this set. In my mind it is an Endor set, not Rogue One, all you need to do is add some Ewoks which you can at least get Wicket now in an affordable set. I&rsquo;m only slightly disappointed in the rigidity of the legs, but not enough to give this set any less than 5 stars. I&rsquo;d say the set is well worth it, even if you have to pay full price for it, at anything less than full price, it is an absolute steal.&nbsp;</p>

"CaptainKindling","2020-09-27T18:55:07.523Z","Fantastic looking model and nice minifigures, but a slightly tedious build.","<p>Rogue One really brought the war to&nbsp;Star Wars, and for many fans (myself included) who grew up on the original trilogy, one of the biggest causes for excitement is the return of some classic design ships and vehicles. Whilst the colossal AT-AT is the most imposing Imperial walker, the smaller bipedal AT-ST is a childhood favourite, and I couldn&#39;t pass up the opportunity to own it in Lego form!<br />
<br />
It comes in a medium-sized box, so if wrapped up as a present will look pretty impressive but not necessarily huge. Once you&#39;re in, the build is a bit of a mixed bag, and could be a bit of an issue depending on who&#39;s building.<br />
Due to the overall design of the legs, it builds largely like a Technic Lego set, with lots of pegs slotting into holes, rather than the more traditional build of clipping bricks in together. As an adult I found this a little bit tedious, but for children towards the lower end of the 8-14 age range this will probably be a bit of a struggle, and so adult help will most likely be required. On top of this, there&#39;s also obviously a lot of repetition here seeing as the two legs are mirrored builds, so this may also test the patience of younger builders.<br />
Once the legs are done, the body is a more traditional Lego build, and so far more enjoyable. The inside of the cockpit has a nice touch of detail, and there are plenty of moving parts to play with! The front and side cannons are all mobile, the lasers fire, and the entire upper body rotates with the turn of a dial on the back, and both the top hatch and the entire cockpit roof open up, undoubtedly leading to hours of fun!<br />
The two downsides are that there are a few stickers, which are a put-off for some collectors, and the upper body of the AT-ST isn&#39;t massively sturdy once assembled. It should be fine on the shelf with the rest of the collection, but if it&#39;s being played with by a child then it might come apart during some of the more excitable moments!<br />
<br />
In total the build took me - a thirty-something semi-adult - just over an hour and a half. As is standard with larger Lego sets, the pieces were separated into several bags (3 in this case) to break the build into easier modules. Due to the large number of pegs involved in construction, I imagine this would be a lot more fiddly upon repeated builds when the pieces are all just jumbled into a single pile!<br />
<br />
The set comes with three minifigures, which are all done up to the usual high Lego standard. You get the AT-ST driver with two facial expressions to choose from, and a generic Rebel trooper. You also get new Rogue One character Baze Malbus, complete with his signature heavy blaster. For the size and price of this set, it&#39;s a very nice little minifigure range.&nbsp; And while the AT-ST Raider from The Madalorian is more recently available and thus carries a more accessible price tag, this is still the most recent option if you want the more traditional Imperial look.<br />
<br />
Overall it&#39;s a great looking model and very good value for money, but not that sturdy and young children would probably struggle with the legs.</p>
