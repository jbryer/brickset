"TK_1308","2017-01-03T12:50:10.457Z","""Are you all blind? Get out there!""","<p>Lego releases its first wave of Rogue One sets with the nicely designed Sienar Fleet Systems TIE/sk X1 experimental air superiority fighter known as the TIE Striker.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>A large rectangular box houses the kit. The TIE Pilot is the figure of choice on the top with the Rebel Trooper, Imperial Ground Crew and Imperial Shoretrooper displayed in the panel next to him. The front shows the TIE Striker making a strafing run on Rebel forces on the surface of Scarif. The back features another battle situation and 4 panels displaying the play features.<br />
There is one large rectangular instruction book.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The price per piece ratio is average for a kit this size. Most of the pieces are light and dark grey with a few blue grey on the outer hull and a few brightly coloured pieces for the internal structure. A lot of new sloped and tiled pieces in this kit for myself so an added bonus for my collection.<br />
There are 5 bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains parts for the lower main hull, the TIE Pilot and the Imperial Ground Crew.<br />
Bag 2 contains parts for the port and starboard sides of the main hull and the upper framework.<br />
Bag 3 contains the parts for the starboard wing, the Rebel Trooper and the Imperial Shoretrooper.<br />
Bag 4 contains the parts for the port wing.<br />
Bag 5 contains the wing stabilisers, hull detailing, fore, aft and dorsal hull plating and hatches.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The set comes with four minifigures.<br />
Firstly we have the TIE Pilot. The detailing on his helmet, torso and legs is excellent and the silver highlights on the helmet and belt really stand out. He has the standard angry clone head beneath the lid. He comes armed with a black blaster rifle, a radio and a pair of grey electrobinoculars, all of which can be stored in the fighter.<br />
Secondly we have the Imperial Ground Crew. The new helmet is beautifully sculpted and like the pilot, the detailing with silver highlights on the torso and legs is well done. He has the comm unit printed head with the mic on the right side. While the back of the torso shows the clips where his batons should go, it&#39;s a shame a brace and clips were not included so he could store the two batons on his back.<br />
Thirdly we have the Imperial Shortrooper. A repaint of the Hovertank Pilot helmet gives us another version for Imperial Forces. Detailing across the figure is once again superb but given the limited colouring applied to the figure, this one is supposed to be the Shoretrooper Squad Leader. While nicely done, it&#39;s a shame they didn&#39;t include a cloth kama for him. He has the standard angry clone head and comes armed with a nice grey representation of the E-22 rifle.<br />
Finally, we have something for the Imperial forces to shoot at, a Rebel Trooper. Decked out in grey and brown fatigues, another excellent figure. Detailing and silver highlights are nicely done for the torso and legs. He has smirking and shouting faces on his head piece. He comes armed with a black blaster with grey extended barrel.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Total building time, 30 minutes.<br />
With all the Imperial fighters so far sharing a rather common structure, it&#39;s refreshing to have something that breaks away from the design while still retaining the classic look.&nbsp;<br />
The long central hull is very sturdy with S.N.O.T. techniques for the sides and large round plates for the ends and hatches, adding to the smooth rounded shape.&nbsp;<br />
The angular wings are nice and solid with a firm internal structure and some nice detailing as well. The mechanism to change them from flight to landed mode is also nicely put together and works very smoothly.<br />
Detailing across the whole fighter is excellent and adds to a great look.<br />
There are 10 stickers to apply. One for the pilot&#39;s radio unit, 5 on the dorsal hull and 2 on each wing.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The TIE Striker is a welcome change to the standard TIE design, incorporating elements of the TIE Bomber and TIE Interceptor into one atmospheric craft.<br />
The cockpit seats one figure and the front portal and roof panels hinge open for easy access. There is a moveable control column for the pilot and the seat inside is nicely built.&nbsp;<br />
There is an aft hatch in the dorsal hull with a storage area with spaces for the pilot&#39;s 3 pieces of equipment.<br />
There are 2 spring loaded missile launchers underneath the cockpit and 3 clear red missiles are included.<br />
The wings can be elevated from landing to flight mode by moving levers on either side of the aft hull.<br />
The TIE Striker measures 42 cm long, 25 cm wide and varies from 7.5 - 9 cm high depending on wing configuration.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>An excellent fighter and a worthy addition to any Imperial force. The ship is very sturdy and flyable for kids, looks great on display and comes with a good selection of minifigures. Wave one of Rogue One Lego sets continues its excellent standard and this kit definitely worth getting.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2017-05-10T22:07:12.56Z","A Surprising Delight to Build!","<p>To be honest, out of the original wave of <em>Rogue One</em> sets, the Tie Striker was the one that least interested me. Without any named characters included in the set, it seemed a bit separate from the other sets. Finding the Tie Striker on sale for$45 USD&nbsp;though made me jump on buying it despite my initial&nbsp;hesitation. What I discovered was that this set was a joy to build and makes a great display model, far exceeding all my initial expectations!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The four figures included in the set are great army builders. However it would have been nice if the set included at least ONE named character (Galen Erso, Saw Gurrera, Bail Organa, Mon Mothma, Moff Tarkin, etc. were all noticeably absent from the Rogue One sets and in the case of Galen, Saw and Bail haven&#39;t been made in any other Lego set). Despite that, the included figures are all scene appropriate matches to the characters who fought in the film&#39;s climactic Battle of Scarrif. Since I enjoy collecting &quot;Original Trilogy&quot; army figures, these figures are a great addition to the collection!</p>

<p><em>&nbsp;Tie Fighter Pilot</em></p>

<p>In term of characters which have been excessively updated over the past few years, the Tie Fighter pilot takes the cake; with multiple variants due to changing Lego designs. Excluding the UCS version though, this figure might be the definitive version of the figure; with its sharp printing and silver detail stripes on the helmet face. This figure is also available in the Microfigther&nbsp;version of the Tie Striker, making it an easy figure to collect.</p>

<p><em>Imperial Ground Crew</em></p>

<p>One of my favorite figures of the set, the Imperial Ground Crew figure has a modified version of the Imperial Gunner helmet. I love the addition of &quot;ear muffs&quot; to the design, a bit of Personal Protective Equipment&nbsp;not normally seen in the Star Wars universe!&nbsp;I personally am a fan of these &quot;non-combative&quot; technician figures, which help give the Imperial ranks a sense of breadth beyond the gun-ho poor aim Stormtrooper&nbsp;or snooty officer&nbsp;types we normally get from Lego. A variant of this figure with Jyn Erso in disguise is included in the Battle of Scarrif set, again allowing the opportunity for an extended collection. I imagine this fig will be useful to MOC &nbsp;builders depicting an Imperial Base or Starship Hangar, where this figure could be displayed on the flight deck.</p>

<p><em>Scarrif&nbsp;Trooper Commander</em></p>

<p>An exclusive figure, this tan colored Stormtrooper variant is a commanding officer for one of the garrison squads on Scarrif. These Shoretroopers&nbsp;have so far only been seen on Scarrif in the films. The drab military colors contrast nicely with the Empire&#39;s normally all black or white trooper ranks. I am particularly fond of the blaster made using the Alien Conquest pistol and a binocular piece. The helmet is the same mold used for the Imperial Tank Driver in the Hovertank set; and reminds me of the EOD Helmet used in the <em>Halo</em> videogames. Non-officer Shoretroopers are included in the Battle of Scarrif set, allowing a collector to build up a squad for this commander to lead!</p>

<p><em>Rebel Soldier</em></p>

<p>Perhaps the most basic of the figures included here, the Rebel Trooper is still a welcome addition to any collector trying to amass figures for Star Wars&#39;s &quot;OT&quot; era. The face is the same one currently used for Captain America, Hawkeye, and the U-Wing pilot in the Microfighter set. The helmet is a nice mold, similar to the garb worn by Rebel soldier in Return of the Jedi. I believe there is a possibility the figure is based on the costume worn by one of the background soldiers who were part of the &quot;Rogue One&quot; squad named in supplementary material, so while not a named character; it can easily be used to represent one.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Although the Tie Striker is a System build, at its heart is a rather ingenious Technic build up which forms the frame and structure needed to support the S-Foil wing functions. Although some of the Technic parts are superfluous to build a weapons holder in the back end of the craft, the rest are used to bolster the folding wing action feature and make a sturdy frame for the rest of the model. The parts are mostly a combination of black, gray, and beautiful sand-blue accent bricks; although the interior of the model includes many shades of bright blues, reds, and greens to help with the construction.</p>

<p>The first two bags are used to assemble the main frame, the next two bags to build the mirror wings, and the final bag has detail parts to finish the cockpit and the roof of the main pod. The wing construction is a bit tedious having to do the same construction twice (just mirrored) but the results are spectacular.</p>

<p><strong>Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>I was surprised by the size and bulk of the finished model! The long wings are eye catching, with their pronged ends giving the ship an aggressive look in person which is far more pleasing than the official set photos entail. The pod has some wasted space with the storage area in the back, and I wish it had been expanded just a little bit to include a seat for a passenger or a secondary gunner. The wing folding action is smooth and fun to play with; and the wings when set in place hold well despite the lack of rubber bands or springs normally required in similar Technic builds. The only weak aspect of the play features are the spring shooters which often fire accidentally due to their location on the bottom of the build where they are exposed to hands trying to grab the main pod of the model.</p>

<p>On display the Tie Striker is in similar proportions to the standard Tie-ln which was released as a system scale set in 2012. The blue accents though on the Striker though help differentiate it, and captures some of the sand blue coloring seen on the models of the Tie Fighters from the Original Trilogy; while not being as overly colorful as the bright blue used in many early Lego Tie Fighter sets. The pod design is great, and it is no surprise to me that modified versions of it have already been used by MOC makers for custom Tie Bombers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>This set caught me off guard, and was far more satisfactory than I expected. I recommend getting it. While the original price seems a bit steep, I think it would have been worth the purchase had the discount only been at $60! Having been able to get it at $45 I feel extremely lucky.This would make a great fleet builder to those looking to buy multiples. Overall it lends to my opinion of the 2016 Rogue One sets in general, that Lego really knocked it out of the ball park with them and has created one of the best licensed set waves in recent memory! The Tie Striker is a great addition to the collection of fans of Rogue One or the Original Trilogy in general.</p>

"CC_2224","2017-07-16T05:33:19.98Z","A visually appealing set and great choice as a Rogue One model","<p>The TIE Striker model has excellent and well thought out construction. The model is much heavier than expected, which is good. The wings can fold or move into an attack position using technic assemblies at the rear. The TIE Striker has generous storage space for accesories in the back, and an easily accessible cockpit in the front.</p>

<p>The parts used to make the model were used appropriately and creatively to give a sizeable amount of greebling and detail. The strips of grey used on the wings were engineered nicely to look appealing from most angles. As for the parts selection, I think it is diverse and contains less common parts that&nbsp;<em>MOCists&nbsp;</em>could find useful or possible turn into a whole new model.</p>

<p>The minifigures are an excellent choice for this type of set. A ratio of 3:1 Empire to Rebel minifigures in an imperial set makes for a believable scene, as well as one rebel scum to blast with the Striker. The pilot is fitting and has good detail, the ground crew and Shoretrooper make for good troop building and would both look good on Scarif. The Rebel Trooper is generic and would fit in an army.</p>

<p>The Building experience was enjoyable even though the second wing felt mundane. The smaller size of the set allowed the duplicate wing to add to the enjoyment the set brought. The playability is there and compliments the accuracy of the build, there are spring loaded shooters which is fun for many, especially young children. I think it is difficult to change the wing position while you fly the ship, so one would have to pause the Striker &#39;mid-flight&#39;. The set has a price per piece on the high side, but the large parts and care put into the model make that excusable;&nbsp;considering there is much worse on the market. When I saw the set images for the first wave of Rogue One sets, this was my initial favorite - and it is still first (Although tied with Krennic&#39;s Imperial Shuttle).</p>

"LegoMoose","2017-11-17T15:32:09.5Z","LegoMoose's TIE Striker review","<p>I really like this set. I really like it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The TIE Striker build is almost minifigure&nbsp;scale, which I like very much. It is the perfect size for someone to fly around and play with. The pill shaped body of the ship is split into two parts. One half is the cockpit, and the other half has a hatch on the top that swings open and reveals a little cargo space. There are two switches on the sides which will raise and lower the wings. Flipping the switch up puts the wings up, and they stay up pretty well, they don&#39;t want to fall back down. Of course, you lower the wings by flicking the switches downwards. The build process is repetitive because the whole build is basically just constructing two giant wings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigure selection is nice, with you getting a rebel, a tie pilot, a shore trooper, and&nbsp;a TIE ground crew member. The real highlight is of course, the shore trooper. He has really nice printing and looks really cool.</p>

<p>The price is too much for 550 pieces. The build is great, but it&#39;s not worth $70.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Due to the pricing, it lowers my rating to a <strong>4.3</strong> out of 5.</p>

<p>Have a great day/evening and happy building</p>

"Kaisermighe","2018-09-19T21:21:41.747Z","I've got one on my tail!!","<p>The Tie/sk atmospheric fighter is one of those new imperial vehicles came from Rogue One that i personally love. It&#39;s a revisiting of the classic tie fighter we all know very well, designed&nbsp;to be faster and have more firepower. Also, this was intended to be used during in-atmosphere dogfights, and by curling down his huge wings it could have gained additional speed. In the movie we see&nbsp;it taking care of x-wings pretty well, as it should be from the lore of this vehicle. I&#39;ve spent about an hour and twenty minutes to assemble it and the process went pretty easy, just building the big wings tended&nbsp;to be repetitive of course.</p>

<p>The 4&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;included are all very accurate. I love the shoretrooper captain, but even the rebel trooper, the striker pilot and the ground crew are all very good. All have details going to the legs and on the back, also they come with a nice array of different&nbsp;weapons and tools. The rebel trooper has double face, meanwhile both shoretrooper&nbsp;and pilot share the angry clone head.&nbsp;My only criticism here is about minifg selection or&nbsp;the lacking of any of the main characters. Were are the named heroes or villains out there? Hello?? Actually i&#39;ve read that&nbsp;the rebel trooper is called Private Basteren, and the imperial ground crew is Kent Deezling, however this doesn&#39;t really change that much.</p>

<p>The airfighter itself looks big and splendid on display. The wings could be raised high or down (from flying&nbsp;mode to attack mode)&nbsp;using a nice mechanism on the back which keeps them in place. Also it&#39;s very cool to give it a better look, maybe on a display stand, it really adds something making it more dynamic. Of course you can open the main cockpit for the pilot, both on the front and on top, but there still remains an arch which doesn&#39;t help you putting the minifigure. The new seat without brick attachment is very good. On the back of the fighter there&#39;s even a cargo area, opening the top door, and again not really much space to put something in (especially if you got&nbsp;big fingers) but still is able to keep locked 3 little items such as a blaster, a device and a microbinocular. Finally let&#39;s not forget the twin spring-loaded red shooters at the bottom, you also get another one spare. Leave them home if you wanna swoosh&nbsp;it around of course, but they work fine as always. The striker is very very sturdy and easy to hold to fly around, giving you great play time.</p>

<p>Overall i found that both playability and displayability are great with this one! The design really captures this unique tie airfighter, with sand blue used beside the usual light grey/black colour scheme. The minifigs are good but the lacking of any of the main characters lets me down a little. The price is by&nbsp;far the only real issue i have with this set. It&#39;s a great set, but the common 70 EU/US$&nbsp;retail price is just over the top. However, in respect to other more overpriced sets, this one is so cool and works so well to me that the price it&#39;s not so bad afterall&nbsp;(but then again it&#39;s way better to get it in discount, it just seems more fair). So&nbsp;i&nbsp;highly recommend this set, it&#39;s definitively on the best tie fighters Lego has ever done.</p>

Sadly this minifigure has the angry clone expression. The torso print also looks great showing armour and a belt. The leg print completes this fantastic figure with more armour plates.

The wings are three plates thick making them sturdy but slim. A mixture of black tiles and plates are used for the wing panels which looks pleasing. Two light grey struts with sticker details cross through the black panels. The main body is well-rounded with a mixture of light grey, dark grey, and sand blue parts. Two spring-loaded shooters can be fired from the bottom of the model. The front of the ship has the classic Tie canopy with a movie accurate print. You can easily open the front canopy and also a hatch on top of the spaceship for easy access to the pilot. The cockpit has ample space for a figure and uses a repurposed battle droid body as a flight yoke. A sticker details the hatch. I appreciate the clean join between the body of the ship and the wings. Around the back of the starfighter is another hatch this time with a print, which opens to reveal storage space for the pilot&#39;s accessories and a walky-talky. I would rather this space had been used to hold a bomb dropping feature as the spaceship &lsquo;in universe&rsquo; is a bomber. An action feature at the back of the ship lets you lift the wings into a landing mode.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The only thing in my opinion that could make it better is the inclusion of a bomb dropping feature, and/or an extra seat for a bombardier.

"CaptainKindling","2020-09-27T18:37:46.08Z","Very enjoyable build, and a stunning addition to the TIE family.","<p>Like the U-Wing, Krennic&#39;s shuttle and the Imperial Hovertank, the TIE Striker was&nbsp;a brand new design of ship which had to look as though it belonged&nbsp;in the era of the original Star Wars trilogy. As far as that task goes, it&#39;s fulfilled the brief beautifully, and the stylish sleekness of this new TIE fighter has been captured perfectly in Lego form.<br />
<br />
First of all, the box is a nice large size,&nbsp;so if you&#39;re giving this to someone (particularly a younger someone) as a gift, it&#39;s definitely going to impress. Inside the box, the build is split across 5 numbered bags to assist in building, rather than having to pile everything together! (Piling everything together is still an option for anyone who wants an additional challenge)<br />
For the best part, the build is very straightforward. The first bag features a lot of &#39;pegs in holes&#39; in the style of Technic Lego, as it&#39;s the bulk of the cockpit and has to accommodate the weight and movement of the wings at a later point. The rest of the build is your more classic &#39;bricks clipping together&#39; Lego style. It took me (a supposed adult) just over an hour and a half to build, so a younger builder would probably be kept occupied for a good few hours, and there aren&#39;t any overly complicated stages which may stump them.<br />
There is a little repetition, as you&#39;d expect from a symmetrical ship, with bags 3 and 4 being mirrored builds of the two wings.<br />
On a slight side note, there are a decent number of brightly coloured bricks in this set, with bright reds, greens, blues and oranges present, which are all covered up by black and grey panels by the end of the build. These are included to make the build process easier,&nbsp;but for young ones who like their Lego to be colourful, they have the added bonus of providing&nbsp;a bit of variety over the darker Imperial colours.<br />
There are quite a lot of stickers to the set, which add a nice touch of detail to some of the larger panels, but I know some collectors find them off-putting, and younger children may need some help lining them up neatly.<br />
<br />
Once built, the Striker is a very good size, and there&#39;s a lot going on with this ship. The wings can be positioned up or down using well-hidden levers at the back of the fighter, and they lock into place quite well. The front window and the roof of the cockpit open up to provide access to the pilot, and there&#39;s a second compartment at the back for storing a walkie-talkie, a pair of binoculars, and a spare blaster rifle. It also fires missiles from underneath the cockpit, and this is where my only criticism of the set comes in.<br />
The majority of Star Wars Lego sets these days have quite clever mechanisms for firing their missiles. The U-Wing has buttons set into the front of the ship, the AT-ST has buttons underneath the driver compartment, the Imperial Shuttle has buttons on the wings, and so on. With the TIE Striker we&#39;re back to the old style of having the missiles protruding from the bottom of the ship, and being fired just by flicking the ends of them. On a ship with such a nice design and a lot generally going on for it, it just seems like a lazy way to finish off the model.<br />
<br />
On the minifigure front there&#39;s a nice little selection. This is the only ship from Wave 1 of the Rogue One Lego not to feature any of the Rogue One crew (or any named characters at all, in fact), but the four you get don&#39;t disappoint. You get a TIE pilot for piloting the ship (obviously), as well as a member of the Imperial ground crew, who looks pretty cool guiding the ship in. You also get one of the new Imperial Shoretroopers from the film, and a Rebel trooper, so they can blast away at eachother while the Striker goes about its business.<br />
<br />
