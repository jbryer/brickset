"18000pieces","2016-10-18T04:14:16.847Z","An excellent model of a unique ship","<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The U-Wing&#39;s bulky 659 parts come in numbered bags, and look quite impressive when spread out on a table. While it is well below the typical &#39;golden&#39; parts/dollar ratio, I didn&#39;t feel cheated - in terms of sheer quantity of plastic, the set easily feels like it&#39;s worth its $80, with a lovely mix of large plates, useful technic pieces, neat slopes, and two, count &#39;em two X-wing windscreens of differing scales. While there were no new parts that made me go &#39;wow!&#39; it was nice to see a Star Wars set so colorful, with white, various greys, blue, and yellow all putting in appearances.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>The build is divided into (I believe) 5 stages using numbered bags, which I ignored. It begins with the top of the ship&#39;s central fuselage, followed by the crew compartment down below, which slots in quite securely using a very clever technic method. After that it&#39;s the massive wing blades and finally the engine pods, whose fourfold duplication is the only part that&#39;s even remotely tedious. The build features a number of interesting SNOT techniques, and constructions which I found edifying - for example, the sliding doors of the troop bay, or the fortified hinges of the folding wings, which allow them not to sag despite their enormous length.</p>

<h3>Figures</h3>

<p>The U-Wing is THE set to buy for Rogue One figures, featuring as it does the two top-billed characters in Jyn Erso (wearing a highly accurate custom helmet piece and a grey fabric poncho) and Cassian Andor (whose face print accurately captures the character&#39;s scruffy facial hair). All that plus the Space Monkey Bistan, with his custom molded head, and a couple of useful utility figures in the U-Wing pilot and the generic Rebel trooper (great helmet). What we&#39;re left wanting is an adversary for all these characters to face off against, and indeed a Shoretrooper or two would&#39;ve truly pushed this figure selection to the next level, but all in all it&#39;s a fine group of figures and all the ones we&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;have are very well done.</p>

<h3>Model</h3>

<p>The U-Wing is surprisingly large when complete, and perhaps even shockingly wide when its wings are open. Its wingspan stretches over two feet, making it wider than a flight-configured Shuttle Tyderium, wider than a flight-configured Krennic&#39;s&nbsp;Shuttle, wider than... you get the picture. It&#39;s really wide. The use of Mixel ball joints to hold the wings in their two positions works great and makes opening and closing them a very satisfying experience.</p>

<p>Beyond the impressive wingspan, the central fuselage is packed with play features, from the troop bay (which can hold all four non-pilot minifigs included, if only just) with its sliding doors and anti-personnel guns, to the spring launches well-hidden in the front. There are also simple utility features like a storage compartment in the rear and a mechanism for popping open the cockpit that add to the feeling of this as a high quality model.</p>

<p>My only real gripe is that the construction of the engine pods, perhaps unavoidably, results in them being able to spin around. It&#39;s a minor annoyance, but on a model that&#39;s overall so solid despite its vast shape-changing abilities it&#39;s an annoyance nonetheless.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The U-Wing is one of my favorite Star Wars sets in recent memory. Don&#39;t be fooled by the low piece count: this one is worth your money. Moreso than the X-Wings with which it shares a price point.&nbsp;It has an appropriate selection of well-done figures, of course, but the real star in my opinion is the U-Wing itself. It&#39;s clear from the trailers that the ship will play an important role in the film, and this is an excellent, substantial model of it.</p>

"Kris_PL","2016-10-22T14:30:30.397Z","Must have Star Wars model.","<p>When first images of the Rouge One sets appeared, this model caught my eye immediately. The minifigs, design and color scheme looked awesome and I couldn&#39;t wait to build it. I was also looking forward to how this fighter looks as a troop transporter. After all, it seems to be the main transportation vehicle of our heroes in the movie.</p>

<h2>The box and instructions</h2>

<p>The box is fairly big, featuring the main play features on the back. Instructions consist of one booklet and a sticker sheet. There is a nice look at all minifigs from the first wave at the back of the booklet.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>All of the figs look splendid. LEGO did a really good job in detailing on all of the minifigures of this wave. Cassian Andor and Bistan look just amazing. Jyn Erso could be improved with the addition of a hairpiece and more detailing on her pants (there is none). However we do get a very cool looking (very soft) poncho and two weapons. The rebel pilot looks very funky with his smiley face. Also im not sure if going back the the old style of helmet is a good move, i personally prefer the Force Awakens ones with the visor. I have to take time to apreciate the rebel troopers for a bit. I was never into rebel troopers (go stormtroopers!) until now. All rebel soldiers of this wave are fantastic! They are different in all of the sets and the detailing is better than ever. In this set, we get one rebel with a green helmet which looks very interesting and his jacket just makes him look ready for a heavy duty combat.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>After 1 hour of assembling, I can easily say that it was one of my favorite star wars set to put together. The building starts with the ship&#39;s top fuselage, which already gives an idea about the final size of the model. Then we go to the troop&nbsp;compartment and the technic connection with the top is done very securely and firmly. The wings are also a fun build and the snot techniques to connect them with the fuselage are very clever. The build finishes up with the engine pods and while i generally enjoy assembling engines for star fighters, these ones were really boring.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The completed model</h2>

<p>It is big and with its wings open, it&#39;s even bigger. Actually super wide would be a better word. Open wings add additional 40 cm to its overall wideness and it is a real pleasure to fly it. I don&#39;t know if i prefer the wings open or closed, because they look good in both configurations. The slot connections locks them very firmly in both options which is nice to see. There is not even a slightest movement.</p>

<p>One of the surprises for me evolves around pilots visibility. The designer added a transparent screen piece on the bottom of the craft, making the cockpit see-through. I didn&#39;t see that before on any star fighter model and it takes a bit away from the bulky look of the troop compartment. Looking from above you can really see the &quot;landing zone&quot; and its a really fun feature. Also there is a small play feature which pops open the cockpit for an easier access. The cockpit itself features only one control panel and I do wish they added a bit more to it.</p>

<p>The troop compartment looks bulky, but features a lot of playability. Sliding doors, <span class=""product-features__description"" data-test=""product-features-description"">pull-out stud shooters and little storage area on the back are really neat. However as a big kid i found it hard to fit a figure in the compartment. </span></p>

<h2>Overall Opinion</h2>

<p>It is definitely my favorite set of this wave. With the great selection of minifigs and great playability of the model, it will definitely be the most demanded set of this wave. As to the overall look of the ship, it may be a bit too bulky when looking from the bottom, but I think the designer did a great job with a given source material. The contrasting whites and blues of the top, really make up for the grey box underneath. I love this set i would recommend it to everyone.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2016-12-29T20:44:08.783Z","Rebel Gunship","<p>When this set was first released I wasn&#39;t very interested in it; I wasn&#39;t familiar with the ship or its purpose in universe. After seeing the film <em>Rogue One</em> I began to take a liking towards the look of the U-Wing, and I decided I wanted to pick it up with some money I got for Christmas. Did this set conjure up the same feelings of&nbsp;excitement I felt while watching the film?</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with five figures; and is the only set in the first wave of<em> Rogue One </em>sets to include the two main characters of the film, Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor.</p>

<p><em>Jyn Erso</em></p>

<p>Jyn is a figure I have mixed feelings about, and is perhaps evidence that Lego&#39;s current &quot;over-detailing&quot; of minifigures can have its detriments. Jyn comes equipped with a poncho, a hand bag, two weapons and a unique hat piece. Her torso print accurately represents her look during most of the movie, but is sadly completely hidden when the poncho is on the figure. The poncho is made of the new fabric material Lego is using.&nbsp;The brim of the figures hat casts the face of the figure in almost constant and un-slightly shadow. Her weapons include a small blaster pistol and a brickbuilt&nbsp;weapon which seems to be&nbsp;either a rocket launcher or a riot staff.&nbsp;These accessories are accurate to the clothes Jyn Erso wears in the second act of the film, but I wish Lego had included a place to&nbsp;store the poncho when Jyn isn&#39;t wearing it, and a&nbsp;hair piece to use when Jyn isn&#39;t wearing her hat; to more accurately recreate the look of the figure as seen in the majority of the movie. Her head is double sided, and her smirking grimace on one side of the head seems to capture the look of the character rather well.</p>

<p><em>Cassian Andor</em></p>

<p>Cassian&#39;s figure represents the clothes the character wears during a large part of the film. The blue jacket print is well done, and the gun metal gray blaster is another great accessory. I don&#39;t know if the faceprint fully captures the look of&nbsp;Diego Luna&nbsp;though. Instead the double sided faceprint reminds me more so of Kyle Katarn from the original <em>Star Wars </em>Legends&nbsp;universe (a bit of irony since in Legends, Kyle Katarn was the rebel who stole the Death Star plans!) Cassian though looks really good when paired with the K-2SO figure from Krennic&#39;s Shuttle. I wish the Cassian and K-2SO had come in the same set though, since in the film the two are an inseparable duo.</p>

<p><em>Bistan</em></p>

<p>One of the alien soldiers part of the Rebelion&#39;s forces in the film&#39;s finale; Bistan is a great generic alien figure. The figure captures the look of the creature seen in the film nicely. Star Wars MOC builds should be happy to have a new alien figure to use to populate their builds.</p>

<p><em>Rebel Soldier</em></p>

<p>Note the photo used on Shop.Lego.com shows two rebel troopers in this set instead of the one that is included. The one that comes with this set wears a new helmet mold with sharp triangular shapes. It looks like a rougher hewn version of the classic Rebel Marine helmet from Episode IV. The&nbsp;torso of the figure is cast&nbsp;in an attractive olive green plastic.&nbsp;This figure is a great army builder, and looks great on display with the Rebel/Resistance figures I have been collecting.</p>

<p><em>Rebel Pilot</em></p>

<p>Not shown in the Shop.Lego.com thumbnail photo is the Rebel Pilot included in the set. The figure is in a new blue jumpsuit costume, which matches nicely with some of the new squads seen in the film. This is another great army builder, and adds nice variety to the traditionally orange suited rebel pilots.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The U-Wing build is well divided into different sub builds; and it almost feels like what be a &quot;real life&quot; assembly process if this craft were a real model. The upper deck and wings are assembled first, followed by the bulky cargo hold underneath. The engines are the final part of the model. Plenty of Technic is used to make the build very sturdy, and the cargo hold connects to the upper frame via pins and Technic beams. The wing mechanism is very simple, yet clever in its use of the new Mixel joints to insure the wing locks into place. Some SNOT builds help to bring detail to the model.</p>

<p><strong>The Finished Model</strong></p>

<p>The U-Wing is a large model. When I compared it to my other Rebel based sets the U-Wing was bigger than the 2012 Y-Wing; dwarfed my snowspeeder, my 1999 X-wing set, and made my 2013 A-Wing look absolutely puny. The&nbsp;similarly sized set in my &quot;Rebel&quot; collection was&nbsp;my Millennium Falcon set (the original set from the early 2000&#39;s). The height of the U-Wing sets it apart from these other sets when it is at rest, and it catches the eye immediately. I find the U-Wing most comparable to my Republic Gunship set from 2002, which seems appropriate as in universe the U-Wing and Gunship both serve similar roles as troop transports.</p>

<p>The U-Wing&#39;s lower body rests easily in my hands, and the model is %100 swooshable. Opening and closing the wings is fun; and when the wings are fully spread out they remind me of the swing wings on a F-14 Tomcat fighter jet. The cockpit opens easily due to a mechanism behind the pilot&#39;s seat, although it should be noted that using this mechanism with a figure sitting in the cockpit will cause the figure&#39;s head to be knocked forward due to the mechanism. The two spring loaded missiles are well integrated into the model, and their firing mechanism is as simple as it is functional; not distracting at all from the finished model. Two small stud shooters are mounted in the cargo bay to be used as point defense turrets. Side doors open and close to allow figures to come in and out of the ship.</p>

<p>My main complaint is that the model&#39;s troop transport has very little space. Most of the useable space was taken up by the Technic support structure and SNOT builds to mount on details. The cargo hold can only easily hold two figures sitting down without accessories, and maybe fit one or two standing up. Getting a figure to stand up in the cargo hold is a hard process due to the small space. This is very upsetting because it is hard to get all five figures included with the set inside the U-Wing all at once. Trying to fit the entire main cast of Rogue One (Cassian, Jyn, Bodhi, K-2SO, Chirrut, and Baze) is near impossible; especially since the roof of the cargo hold is so short that K-2SO can hardly even stand in it!</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Despite my nitpicks, this has ultimately been a very fun set to have. It is fun to pick up in one hand and swoosh around in the other. While the figures do have their flaws; when combined with other Rogue One characters they create a wonderful representation of the film&#39;s cast. The ungainly look of the U-Wing makes it look at home next to Lego sets based on the X-Wing or the Y-Wing, and it looks like it truly belongs in the Star Wars universe. I recommend this set to fans of <em>Rogue One</em> who want a great movie souvenir, and to Star Wars Lego fans looking to expand their Rebel fleet.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions:</p>

<p>Standard Box, shows the model well with the now standard&nbsp;action pictures on the back, the Manual is one book. instructions are easy to follow,</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>A good variety of parts, there is 659 in total, there is some technic bits&nbsp;added to the mix but this is more common on bigger builds so not unusual there, a small sticker sheet, Main colours used are Grey &amp; White with touches of blue and yellow.</p>

<p>Mini figures:</p>

<p>5 in total,. The 2 main stars of the film plus 3 others, The Rebel Trooper is a good version on Rebel Trooper and having now seen the film this is reflected well. The U-Wing Pilot wears a blue suit which I think again reflects well from the film. Bisten seen&nbsp; as a gunner in the U-Wing&nbsp;in the trailers and makes fleeting appearance in the film, has a unique head piece made especially, looks impressive this character is played by Warrick Davis this has got me wondering how many Lego Figures he has......</p>

<p>Cassian Andor I like the look of the figure, if anything a bit Han Solo, Blue Suit which blends into brown on the legs, this is based on the outfit he wears on Jeddah, Jyn Errso the leading lady, Rebel Helmet similar to Rebels from Hoth with goggles, she comes with 3 accessories including a poncho which has a nice feel, she is my favorite character from the set.</p>

<p>Build and Completed Model:</p>

<p>This is a good set to build, the instructions make it easy to follow,I especially like the way the&nbsp;cockpit canopy is built in and&nbsp;how you push bricks to&nbsp;open it, very clever and smart. When complete the U-Wing looks impressive, 44cm long and 20cm wide with wings closed plus a height of 10cms high, with wings open it is 34cm long and 64cm wide (wider than the falcon 32cm). It took me a good couple of hours to build. Some people may be quicker but I enjoyed the experience.</p>

<p>Overall Opinion:</p>

<p>I can&#39;t&nbsp;remember&nbsp;the last time I built a set that I enjoyed so much, part for me&nbsp;was the unknowing and seeing the model take shape was very satisfying, this is new to the star wars universe its unique, 5 figures&nbsp;adds value, The model&nbsp;stands out.&nbsp;Well worth the buy and I&#39;m glad I have this model in my collection&nbsp;</p>

"Nuruodo","2016-11-04T21:49:10.063Z","Rogue One in action","<h2>Box/Instructions</h2>

<p>The box is slim and medium-sized, resembling other starfighters&#39; boxes. The picture on it represents the U-wing flying low on a desert planet (probably Jedha), with Rogue One rebels running against enemies and Bistan shooting from the fuselage. On the back there are playable functions, as usual; as background there is a landed U-wing, with switched wings, on a blue-colored ground. Instructions are in one single book, clear and detailed as usual.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>There a lot of grey and white bricks, plus yellow, blue and sand ones. Little pieces are used to achieve a high level of details in all the model, although wings, for example, are made with big triangular pieces and they still appear well detailed. There are several stickers, but not in too large number; and I&#39;ve also to say that they are very easy to apply (I made no mistakes!).</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve chosen this set especially for the minifigures. Three out of five are main characters in <em>Rogue One</em>, so this is the set with more protagonists in it. I&#39;ll start from the less appealing minifigure, the <strong>U-wing pilot</strong>. It resembles other Rebel pilots, but his flight suit is blue and details are well refined.&nbsp;The&nbsp;<strong>Rebel trooper&nbsp;</strong>is very nice; the most surprising thing is the headgear, somehow similar to Rebel troopers&#39; helmets in&nbsp;<em>A New Hope</em>, but more complex and fascinating than it. A high level of details is also reached in the torso and on the legs, with pockets and elastics represented on them.&nbsp;<strong>Bistan&nbsp;</strong>has a unique head, which is a single piece. The printings on body and legs appear similar to Rebel trooper&#39;s ones, but they are different.&nbsp;<strong>Cassian Andor</strong>&nbsp;is well made, and is nearly identical to the original character.&nbsp;<strong>Jyn Erso</strong>&nbsp;is the most particular minifigure: she has a unique cloak, in a strange material (not the usual one of other fabric parts). Also the headgear is unique: it seems a helmet from a Rebel cold weather&nbsp;trooper (as they appear on Hoth in&nbsp;<em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>), but down there are hair sculpted, and this is very rare I think.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The build was not long as I thought it would be. It starts with the hull (top before than down), then it goes on with wings and, at the end, reactors. Although there are some specular parts (wings and reactors), I didn&#39;t find the build repetitive, since these structures were fast to build. There are a lot of interlockings, to link the wings, the reactors and passengers compartment. This one is very well made, with the doors sliding and allowing minifigures to be introduced.</p>

<h2>The completed model</h2>

<p>The model is very big. The wings make it seem so huge that it surely seems bigger than X-wings (as, in fact, it should be). I find reactors very big, related to the rest, but it&#39;s the same in the real model, so no issues to complain. I particularly appreciate the passengers compartment. Wings mechanism works perfectly, as the doors&#39; one do. Shooters are hidden in a very appreciable way: you need to push on the part front to the cockpit to make them activate, so they are perfectly integrated in the model. Only two things are different from original model:&nbsp;the color scheme (there are no yellow parts in the original) and the proportions (wings are too short and thick in the Lego version).</p>

<h2>Overall opinion</h2>

<p>What to say. It&#39;s nearly perfect. I find no big cons, except, maybe, the price. There are a lot of minifigures, the build is pleasant, the model is pretty&nbsp;similar to original one, and although some differences&nbsp;as a Lego set it&#39;s very nice. 5 stars, nothing else to say.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; fantastic selection of minifigures</p>

<p>&ndash; good techniques to create the model</p>

<p>&ndash; impressive size</p>

<p>&ndash; no boring build</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>&ndash; price is high (but no so high, also considering the good price-per-piece rate)</p>

<p>&ndash; differences from original model (color scheme, wings&#39; proportions, cockpit&#39;s rear)</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The nice large rectangular box contains the set. Bistan is the figure of choice on the top with the Rebel Trooper, U-Wing Pilot, Cassian Andor and Jyn Erso displayed in the panel next to him. The front shows the U-Wing making a combat drop on Jedha. The back features another battle situation and 3 panels displaying the play features.<br />
There is one large almost A4 size instruction book.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The price per piece ratio is average for a kit this size. Most of the pieces are light and dark grey, white and a few brightly coloured pieces for the internal structure and detailing. Some nice new pieces for my collection with some of the plating pieces and the new colour weapons.<br />
There are 5 bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains parts for the middle of the main hull, Jyn Erso and Cassian Andor.<br />
Bag 2 contains parts for the port and starboard wings and some of the upper hull plating.<br />
Bag 3 contains the parts for the lower hull / troop compartment, the Rebel Trooper and Bistan.<br />
Bag 4 contains the parts for the lower aft hull, lower forward hull, upper hull engine mountings, upper hull plating and cockpit and the U-Wing Pilot.<br />
Bag 5 contains the parts for the 4 engines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The set comes with five minifigures.<br />
Firstly we have the Jyn Erso. Seen here in the outfit she wears on Eadu. The detailing on the torso is nice but completely covered by her cloth poncho. She has smiling and angry faces on her head. The new helmet piece is superb and has her hair attached. There is a silver mic on the left and goggles can be clipped into the front above the peak of the cap. She comes equipped with one of her baton weapons, a brown satchel and a silver compact blaster pistol.<br />
Secondly we have Cassian Andor, and like Jyn he&#39;s in his Eadu outfit. The detailing on his torso and legs is excellent and the silver highlights on the buckle and pouches really stand out. He has serious and quizzical faces on his head. There&#39;s not really that much difference in the two but his face, beard and stubble are nicely done. He comes equipped with a gunmetal &nbsp;grey blaster.<br />
Thirdly we have Bistan. The Iakaran&#39;s features have been brilliantly rendered for minifigure scale with a new moulded head piece. The markings for his facial hair, eyes and mouth are very well done. His flight suit in well detailed with nice highlights on both torso and legs and he comes armed with a gunmetal grey blaster.<br />
Next up is the generic Rebel Trooper. The head just has the one serious face printed on it. The new helmet design is good and the colour scheme is pleasing. The detailing on his torso is okay but the pouches on his front just end at the belt which is a shame as they look half done. The back is better with the hood and straps across the body. The legs have pockets and kneepads on them. He also comes armed with a gunmetal grey blaster.<br />
Finally we have the U-Wing Pilot. He has the standard pilot with goggles head piece with smiling and scared faces printed on it. His blue flight suit is well detailed with the chest pack, ribbed vest and strapping across both torso and legs. His white helmet has some nice markings on too. He&#39;s armed with a standard black compact blaster pistol.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Total building time, 45 minutes.<br />
It&#39;s nice to finally have a rebel ship that doesn&#39;t fall into the standard build pattern as the U-Wing is one part fighter craft and one part troop carrier.<br />
The hull is quite bulky but very solid with the troop compartment slung underneath and the pilot sitting atop in the spacious cockpit.&nbsp;<br />
The design for the wings is another nice sturdy build. Multiple hinge plates, ball joints and clips ensure a solid structure for both atmospheric and space flight configurations.<br />
The troop compartment doors open in a design similar to the aft doors on the Republic L.A.A.T.s. The concealed mechanism for the missile launchers is nicely done and very tidy.<br />
Nothing particularly complex in the kit itself but the detailing across the whole ship and the white / grey colour scheme give you an impressive looking set.<br />
There are 16 stickers to apply. There are 8 are for the engine detailing, one on each wing, 4 for the troop compartment doors and 2 on the lower cockpit window edging.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Despite getting some negative press from Star Wars fans, I really like the design of the U-Wing. It&#39;s a good, solid, flyable craft with plenty of play features. There is a few little issues but it doesn&#39;t detract from the finished item.<br />
The cockpit seats one figure and there is a slider mechanism located being it to pop the canopy open enough so you can use your fingers to open it the rest of the way. My only quibble is that the pilot has to lay down to fit in there and can&#39;t reach the controls.<br />
The wing mechanism for changing flight modes is manually achieved but the ship looks great in either configuration.&nbsp;<br />
The troop compartment underneath has opening doors on either side. &nbsp;There are two stud shooters mounted on arms that can swing out from inside. While the compartment could store four figures, access to it is a problem. As the doors swing back toward the aft hull, the restrict access into the interior which makes getting troops in there a somewhat fiddly job.<br />
There are two front mounted guns and two spring loaded missile launchers. These are activated by pressing down two sections in the hull just in front of the cockpit.&nbsp;<br />
In space flight mode the ship measures 46 cm long, 30.5 cm wide and 11 cm tall.<br />
In atmospheric flight mode the ship measures 40 cm long, 64 cm wide and 11 cm tall.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>One of the best Rebel ships to come out in recent years, the U-Wing is a must have for any Rebel force. Combined with (currently) 5 exclusive figures it makes this set a must have vehicle.&nbsp;</p>

"brick006","2017-01-07T06:59:43.207Z","State of Modern Lego","<p>Let me start by stating my main takeaway from this set. I think the model is a good at capturing the U-Wing look and basic function. However, I felt overall a bit underwhelmed in the product.</p>

<p>As I was putting the set together, I kept wondering about the direction the construction was going. This was particularly in regards to the cargo section which featured some interesting combinations of bricks. I thought, hmm this is neat, I wonder what function or feature this is going to be for? However once I attached the cargo section to the upper ship, I couldn&#39;t help but feel dissapointed and confused. What was the point of all those extra steps and pieces? It seemed very over complicated for what the final cargo section actually ended up being.</p>

<p>And this reinforces a nagging suspition I&#39;ve been getting within the past 2 years or so of Lego sets. I get the feeling Lego has been trying to boost the cost of their sets by complicating the construction using many smaller pieces in lieu of 2 or 3 larger bricks that would structurally accomplish the same purpose. This appears clearest to me in the new x-wings models going for $60-80 compared to older models that sold at $25 and both models share the same basic structure with a few differences. I find it hard to believe the differences should account for 2x the original parts count. We know that the average cost per brick is some &cent;10 per brick and of course inflation plays a small role. However, Lego can make a larger profit giving you a bunch of 1x1 plates vs. the same number of 2x6 bricks, but you will pay the same price. This I think is the subtle strategy being waged on our wallets.</p>

<p>All of my wild conspiracy theories asside, I think this set is not the worst culprit and actually offers a lot of good pieces but I question if it could have been made at some 400 PC. Part count and I don&#39;t doubt it.</p>

<p>The other major issue I have is the minifigs included here. This is the main vehicle of the protagonists in Rogue One and though it would be overly optimistic to include all of the main characters, I think it&#39;s a bit ridiculous that K-2SO wasn&#39;t even included with Cassian and Jyn seeing as they were the group that set out initially from the rebel base. Since they included Jyn and Cassian, I think K-2SO should have been there. They should have substituted the generic rebel for him in my opinion. Another very minor gripe is that an alternate long Hair head piece for Jyn would have been nice.</p>

<p>Bitter feelings asside, the ship looks the part, is sturdy, has a good scale, and good features which include: wings that lock into two configurations, hinged bay doors for the cargo hold, spring launching projectiles.</p>

"CC_2224","2017-07-17T21:03:12.763Z","The most iconic ship from Rogue One, delivered in less than $100","<p>When I saw the initial set images for this model I didn&#39;t really like the look of the set, I thought it looked like a thin frame on top of a fat box. I still picked up the set, and it was much better than I thought. The shape of the model is actually very nice, and it looks even better when the wings are folded out. The cargo bay can hold 2 gunners (While open), and you can squeeze Jyn and Cassian in if you really want to. The cockpitfits very well with the model, and it can be opened when you move the silver studs forward. It has a great amount of space for the pilot, and the large windscreen looks great from the cockpit and provides a nice transition from the cargo bay up to the hull.</p>

<p>The parts are nicely (And accurately) used within the model. There is a freat amount of greebling and unique pieces that could be used for MOCs. Jyn&#39;s accessory also has two Barraki eyes in black, which may be useful to some.</p>

<p>The minifigure selection is large for a $90 USD ($100 CAD) set containing 5 minifigures. The&nbsp;U-Wing Pilot with an appropriate sized blaster. Bistan, who has a nicely moulded face. A rebel trooper with a large helmet. Cassian Andor who has accurate detail to the real character. And Jyn Erso, who had a lot of effort put into her minifigure, she has a grey cloth piece for her torso, a brown satchel that fits right on top of the cloth, as well as a rebel style cap and silver blaster similar to the ones in the film. (Brickset.com uses the wrong set image that replaces the pilot with the Rebel Trooper featured in the TIE Striker set)</p>

<p>The set was a very fun build which didn&#39;t take too long. I found that it was all a fresh experience and repetition was minimal. The set has some play features: You can open the doors to the lower bay and flip out the stud shooters, the windscreen to the cockpit opens with the movement of silver studs, you can push elevated blue 1x2 tiles to fire spring loaded shooters, and finally, you can move the wings back to make the U-Wing fly into an awesome looking attack position. The sets price is not too bad for a Stat Wars set, and as the main Rebel set for Rogue One $90 is pretty fair, and the price per piece only goes up by 1 cent from Star Wars&#39; average (11.09 cents). I think the U-Wing is one of the best Rogue One sets to get as it is one of a kind and on par with the Millennium Falcon in terms of the protagonists&#39; usage of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The Star Wars price per piece average was obtained from JANGBRiCKS in early June 2017.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-08T03:09:35.323Z","Great Exterior, Not so Great Inside","<p>The exterior of this U-Wing looks awesome! The white with blue stripes really looks good together and the little hints of yellow and light gray really break up the main 2 colours to help make the ship look older and like it has seen some action. The way they integrated the spring-loaded missiles is so sleek and barely noticeable. The doors work well and the cockpit is very nice. The problem is that this is a transport/gunship that is supposed to bring troops into battle, but it can&#39;t do that if it can only hold 2 or 3 minifigures in itself at a time. That is the only reason why this doesn&#39;t make it to a full 5 stars. The minifigures are very good, and I&#39;m pleasantly surprised that they made a head mold for that alien gunner. Overall I would highly recommend this set to anyone who likes the rebellion or the movie Rogue One. I am also a bit annoyed that they did not include a proper U-wing pilot but rather a Y-wing pilot instead.</p>

"CaptainKindling","2020-09-27T18:33:04.007Z","Fun build, great model, but more of the Rogue One crew would have been nice.","<p>Courtesy of Rogue One, the U-Wing is the latest addition to the Rebel fleet, and to mark the release of the film it was been brought to life in Lego form. Whilst it can certainly pack a punch in its own right, it&#39;s more of a troop transport than a dedicated fighter, which is reflected in its slightly bulky underside, but by no means does this make it an unattractive model or a dull build.<br />
<br />
The box itself is a good size, so if this is going to be a gift then it&#39;ll certainly get pulses racing (and even if it&#39;s not, it&#39;s nice to gawk over for a while before opening).<br />
Once you&#39;re inside, Lego have done their usual thing of separating the blocks into numbered bags to make the build flow more easily. In this case there are 5 bags in total.<br />
<br />
The build is a decent length - as an adult it took me 2 hours to do, and I&#39;m something of an impatient builder! For a younger fan or someone who is just happy to take things at a more leisurely pace, this could easily occupy the best part of an evening.<br />
There is a little repetition to the build in the wings, but this is pretty minimal. Whilst they do give the U-Wing its distinctive shape, they&#39;re a relatively short part of the build, so this will be unlikely to be a sticking point for youngsters.<br />
On the whole the build is thoroughly enjoyable. The ship starts to take shape surprisingly quickly, and so it gives a great deal of pleasure to see it expand to its completed state. On the top it&#39;s nice and sleek, with the little touches of blue and yellow colouring really popping against the white which makes up the bulk of the ship. The lower half of the ship is - as mentioned earlier - a little more blocky as it consists of the troop transport area and the door guns. Getting the mini figures into this compartment is a little fiddly, and one downside to the model on the whole is that there isn&#39;t enough room for all of the figures inside the ship - 2 will always have to stay on the ground!<br />
This flat underside doesn&#39;t detract from the U-Wing&#39;s style, and gives the model a handy flat base on which to stand the ship up.<br />
On the sticker front, this is a sticker-heavy set. The engines alone contain 8 stickers, and then there are additional ones for various areas of the hull. I&#39;m impartial when it comes to stickers, but small children may struggle with them and I know some collectors dislike them, so be warned!<br />
<br />
Once the model is built, it has a lot of features to interact with. The wings can be swept back for flight mode, and click securely into both positions to stay that way during play. These are operated separately, rather than having a feature like the X-Wing to open them all simultaneously. The canopy of the cockpit fits very snugly into the top of the ship, so this is lifted by the use of a small lever behind the cockpit. The side doors of the troop section slide open, and the internal guns can be swung out to fire lasers across the living room (on a slight side note, they haven&#39;t provided many spares of these, so it&#39;s advised to keep a close eye on them!), and missiles can be fired from the front of the ship, using a pair of buttons discreetly set into the nose of the ship. There&#39;s also a large lowering door at the rear of the ship, although I&#39;m not sure of its purpose as there&#39;s not enough room behind it for any figures! But all in all, it&#39;s a lot of fun to play with!<br />
<br />
On the mini figure side you get a decent number of figures, but I personally was a little disappointed by the range. You get Cassian and Jyn, but seeing as the U-Wing is the team&#39;s initial ship, I would have hoped to get more of the key Rogue One characters, particularly K-2SO. Instead you get a generic U-Wing pilot and rebel trooper, and Bistan, who is barely even a third-tier character, and far less welcome than another of the main team would have been.<br />
<br />
Aside from the couple of minor gripes mentioned above, it&#39;s a cracking model. Fun to build, plenty to play with, and stunning to look at. Highly recommended for any Rogue One/Lego fan.</p>
