"Hugh_s_Brix","2016-10-10T01:41:12.89Z","Krennic's Shuttle Review","<p>Krennic&#39;s imperial shuttle is a very pleasing set. It is a new variation of an imperial shuttle that will be seen in the upcoming Rouge One movie later this year. This set is the biggest of the Rogue One line and probably my favorite.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box of the set is a relatively normal size for a set &nbsp;like this. It has a rectangle shape. The new 2017 box art of the death trooper is shown in the top right corner of the box. The front of the box shows the shuttle in flight mode as&nbsp;well as what it looks like with the wings folded up for landing mode. The minifigures are also featured on the front. The back of the box shows how the shuttle opens up as&nbsp;well as some of the play features in the set.</p>

<p>The instruction mannual&nbsp;is quite thick with 272 steps! The instructions were not backed with cardboard so mine came with a small crease but nothing major.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The part count of the set is quite decent for the price. The set contains 863 pieces in which some of them are new molds or new colours.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures in this set are great. I think some could have been improved but they are all great minifigures.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bodhi Rook is a good figure. I think he could be improved&nbsp;as he has no leg printing. I also think he could have had the imperial logo as arm printing. (look it up it&#39;s actually there) He has standard dark grey legs with a very well detailed torso that depicts a brown jacket over grey clothing. His back shows the back of the jacket with some brown straps. His brick-built backpack is interesting. It uses two studs and a pistol piece to make a back pack.He has two faces. One with the goggles on and one with the goggles off. His hair piece is black with&nbsp;hair tied at the back. I think it is the same hair piece used with Kanan Jaras&nbsp;from the rebels line. Bodhi comes equipped with a blaster pistol.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Pao is a big stand out for the set. He has very detailed printing as&nbsp;well&nbsp;as another brick built backpack. His legs are dark tan with some light tan printing on them. His torso is mostly taken up by the grey jacket that he is wearing. Back printing shows the straps for the jacket. his face is light grey with an angry look to it his alternate face depicts him screaming. I think his headgear is a new mold. it is&nbsp;light tan with a creamy brown colour. His backpack has an antenna piece on it as&nbsp;well as a printed piece for extra detail. He has a long blaster rifle.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>K2-S0 is a very detailed figure. He uses the longer droid legs in black. his torso is a new mold with the head attacked. He has a control panel in the middle of his torso and a very detailed head with so many little features like textures on he neck and splashes on the side of his head. The coolest part of him is the imperial symbol on his shoulders. It&#39;s such a nice print.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Director Krennic is another figure I think could have been improved. His head, hair and torso are amazing but his legs are too plain. They are just black with no printing on them. I think it would have been good if his coat was printed further onto his legs (as it is in the movie). Although I may not like parts of him the torso and head redeem everything. The torso is a white version of the imperial officer uniform. He has a black belt and the blue and red squares (that I think are medals). He has a soft cloth cape (which is very necessary as it gets crammed in the cockpit.) His expression is very serious and his hair is dark tan. He is equipped with a gunmetal grey blaster.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>The death troopers are AWESOME! They are so highly detailed. They basically have the stormtrooper printing but with more weapons strapped to them. The black shoulder pauldron&nbsp;has grey lines to give it depth. The face is (no surprise) angry clone. The helmet is a new mold with a lot of detail on it such as the green dots and the grey outlining with the eyes. They have standard blasters for weapons.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build of the set was quite interesting. I enjoyed building bags 1 and 2 very much, however I found the wings annoying to build twice. (Obviously you need two wings so that is a minor detail) The build was a little challenging, but I think most people would be able to do it.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model is very sleek looking. The wings fold down to transform into flight or landing mode. This is done using a ball joint which I think is silly as over time it will get weaker and eventually break. Spring loaded shooters are located under the wings and they are hidden pretty well.</p>

<p>The main area of the ship takes a very triangular shape. The ship opens up by pulling down the two side panels as&nbsp;well as the front panel and the back panel. The cockpit at the top also opens to&nbsp;reveal Krennic&#39;s&nbsp;chair which is a really interesting build. The front panel reveals a seat for two pilots and the side flaps open for one trooper to fit either side. There is also a loading ramp in the front of the ship.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>My overall opinion&nbsp;of the set is that it is great. Sure there could be improvements but I think the positives cancel out the negatives. I highly recommend getting this set if you have the opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>Very good set!</p>

"weirdbricks","2016-12-18T16:55:40.15Z","A fantastic set!","<p>For this review, i will mostly express my thoughts on this set!</p>

<p>90$ is a great price, but in Norway, it sadly costs 125$ (so it effects my review a bit).</p>

<h3>The main set:</h3>

<p>What i think is excellent with this set is that it looks very similar to the real model! I might say this is the best lego star-wars remake of a ship. The details are also fantastic, a very good use of a black train-track piece for the main wing! A con could be from the back; you see many of the technic pieces, that you most likely do not want to see. I also think the way the wings are folding, is very good made. The interior have in total five seats and space for more.</p>

<h3>The figures:</h3>

<p>You get six figures. I think K-2SO and Krennic&nbsp;are the best ones! The figures are very good detailed and fits perfectly with the rest of the theme. The imperial troopers are also nice!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>A lovely and great set! The figures are awesome, and the ship is amazing! I just don&#39;t like the price here in Norway (Scandinavia too)! Overall: 8/10!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Thanks for reading my review! I hope you found it helpful. Before disliking, remember our opinion could be different! Thx in advance!</em></p>

"TK_1308","2017-01-03T16:49:59.313Z","""The work has stalled. I need you to come back.""","<p>Lego finishes it releases for the first wave of Rogue One sets with Director Krennic&#39;s Sienar Fleet Systems Delta Class T-3c Shuttle.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The large almost square box for the shuttle. Orson Krennic is the figure of choice on the top with K-2SO, Bodhi Rook, Pao and the Deathtroopers displayed in the panel next to him. The front shows the shuttle in a battle in orbit of the Death Star. The back features the ship in a battle on Scarif and 7 panels displaying the play features.<br />
There is one large almost A4 size instruction book.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The price per piece ratio is average for a kit this size. Most of the pieces are light and dark grey, black and a few brightly coloured pieces for the internal structure. Some nice new pieces for my collection with some of the black plating pieces and the new colour weapons.<br />
There are 7 bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains parts for the central hull framework, Director Krennic and the two Imperial Deathtroopers.<br />
Bag 2 contains parts for the internal detailing of the main hull and the landing treads.<br />
Bag 3 contains the parts for the dorsal wing.<br />
Bag 4 contains the parts for the starboard wing, Bodhi Rook and Pao.<br />
Bag 5 contains the parts for the port wing.<br />
Bag 6 contains the parts for the forward guns and port and starboard hull plating.<br />
Bag 7 contains the forward and aft hull plating and K-2SO.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The set comes with six minifigures.<br />
Firstly we have Director Orson Krennic. The detail on his tunic is superb and his white cloth cloak completes the look. He just has a single serious face printed on his head. The silver detailing for his belt, code cylinders and insignia stand out rather well. He comes armed with a silver grey blaster.<br />
Secondly we have the two Imperial Deathtroopers. The detailing across the torso and legs on the troopers is superb with all the details like the thermal detonators, ammo pouches and the different knee pads for each leg. They each have a soft black and grey shoulder pauldron for the right arm and both are equipped with black blasters.<br />
Thirdly (or fourthly) we have K-2SO. The droid has been nicely created in minifigure scale with a brand new torso piece. The details in such a small droid are excellent, right down to the silver Imperial insignia imprinted on his shoulders.&nbsp;<br />
Next up is Imperial pilot Bodhi Rook. Compared to the others, he has less detailing, just on his torso showing his utility vest over his flight suit. He sports Kanan Jarrus&#39; hair piece and his head has a smiling face on one side and his concentrating face sporting his tech glasses on the other. He comes equipped with a small backpack and a black compact blaster pistol.<br />
Finally we have my favourite, Pao. The Drabata is a great little minifigure. His head has serious and screaming faces printed on it. The new head piece is nicely crafted. The detailing on the torso and legs are very well done and the details for his comms pack are provided by a sticker. He comes armed with a black assault rifle.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Total building time, 60 minutes.<br />
We&#39;ve had several Imperial shuttle kits over the years but this black T-3c is one of the best.<br />
The build is relatively straightforward with lots of care to reinforce the internal structure to make sure that the model stays solid and makes is flyable for kids.<br />
All of the hull plates have sturdy hinges to allow access but also keep the plating firmly in place.<br />
The wings are manually adjusted but the combination of support struts and ball jointed hinges make them very secure in either flight or landing mode.<br />
The overall design captures the look and feel of the ship very well and the black colour scheme just looks much nicer. The detailing on the hull plating and wings is excellent.<br />
There&#39;s some nice touches for the interior, Krennic&#39;s seat for example, and the designer has taken care to make sure the ship looks great both inside and out.<br />
There are 9 stickers to apply. Two are the control consoles in the front, one is the console in the main cockpit, four are for detailing inside the main hull, one of the aft exterior hull and the last one is on Pao&#39;s comms pack.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Krennic&#39;s Imperial Shuttle is a great looking vehicle and makes an impressive toy and display piece. It has a fair few features as well.<br />
The upper cockpit can be opened separately and seats Director Krennic. The whole of the main hull can be accessed as the hull plating opens up easily to allow access. The ship seats five minifigures and there are clips in the aft section and one by each of the forward seats for weapon storage. I was somewhat disappointed that K-2SO cannot fit anywhere in the ship properly.&nbsp;<br />
There is a spring loaded missile launcher under each wing and the ship is also armed with two twin mounted laser cannons at the front and a cannon on each wing tip.<br />
There is a token boarding ramp under the front which can be lowered in landing mode but doesn&#39;t lead to any real access in the ship.&nbsp;<br />
The landing treads move in unison and fold close to the hull when the ship is in flight.<br />
In landing mode, the sip measures 21 cm long, 17 cm wide and 33 cm tall<br />
In flight mode, the ship measures 21 cm long, 58 cm wide and 45 cm tall.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Like all other kits in Rogue One&#39;s first wave, this one doesn&#39;t disappoint. A great kit for kids and adults alike with some play features and a good selection of minifigures. Krennic&#39;s Imperial Shuttle should be on any Star Wars fans wish list.</p>

"CC_2224","2017-12-31T04:32:03.38Z","This Imposing and Stunning Shuttle Makes for a Great Addition to any Lego Collection","<p>While all of the first-wave Rogue One: A Star Wars Story sets are beautifully made, Krennic&#39;s Imperial Shuttle has to be the most impressive model. This shuttle is sizeable&nbsp;when it is in landing position, but when the wings are fully folded out, it looks much larger with a farther reach and more dominating appearance. The ships color scheme and detail is very accurate to the film, and the inside is well-designed for a scaled down model. The minifigures of this set all had great care put into them, the two Death Troopers, K-2SO, and Director Krennic all remain exclusive to this set and justify its moderate value in terms of price per piece.</p>

<p>The building experience was fun, the vessel came together very well, and very little can take away the fun from building Lego. The two wings and two side panels however were mirrored, and having to build the same (Or mirrored) components can be inconvenient for some, which objectively takes away from the building experience. There are also stickers in the set which is unfortunate, because if somebody makes a mistake, they could damage the sticker and take away from&nbsp;the set.</p>

<p>The parts in this set are all used appropriately and they come together to make a durable model. The parts used to change the positioning of the wings are part of&nbsp;the Character and Creature Building System and do not have much issue with breaking and getting stuck. Krennic&#39;s cape is also the new kind that is soft and does not &#39;crinkle&#39;.</p>

<p>The shuttle can be &#39;piloted&#39; very easily by children, and it is very enjoyable to &#39;fly&#39;. The entire interior of the craft can be accessed by easily opening the panels where all three Imperial figures can be seated. The spring loaded shooters can be simply fired from beneath the wings, and if one does not like the look, they can remove them.</p>

<p>The set has an average value for a Star Wars set at 10.4 cents per piece in the United States. Even though it is on the higher side of Lego prices, the model is well constructed and the minifigures, especially the iconic and desirable Death Troopers / K-2SO add to the value of this set.</p>

<p>The minifigures in this set are all nicely detailed and relevant to the set. Pao&nbsp;and Bodhi Rook are both &#39;spot-on&#39; to their movie appearances and were present in multiple scenes. K-2SO was a popular comedic character and his print went to the tip of his shoulders, this custom droid was definitely worthy of being in the largest set of the Fall 2016 releases, and is a big draw for this set. Death Troopers, in this case, Krennic&#39;s&nbsp;&#39;Death Squad&#39;&nbsp;are the mascot of the boxes for this wave, they have also been heavily promoted, and were threatening in the movie. They have extreme detail, and a shoulder pauldron. Finally, the main figure for this set, Director Orson Krennic has a beautifully designed figure, with a soft white cape, accurately colored hair, and correctly detailed clothing.</p>

<p>Krennic&#39;s Imperial Shuttle is a wonderful set. It has a great build both aesthetically and structurally. The minifigures are a large draw to the set as well. The price may not be the best, but it is overshadowed by the near-perfect model and exclusive minifigures. I would recommend this set to collectors of Star Wars, and any Lego fan of spacecrafts.</p>

"Nookman8","2017-05-05T02:44:41.08Z","Krennic's Swooshable Shuttle!","<p>Well, it&#39;s May fourth (At least at the time of&nbsp;writing this)&nbsp;so, I decided why not make a Star Wars set review? I don&#39;t have anything else better to do. So, let&#39;s stop wasting time and begin this!</p>

<h2><strong>The Box</strong></h2>

<p>The box itself is a normal $90-$100 size box. Like in 2015 with &quot;The Force Awakens&quot;, the banner is changed to the next year&#39;s banner for toy lines and such. This time, it&#39;s a Death Trooper in front of a black background with a splotch of very light blue. There&#39;s also some tiny TIE Fighters flying in front of the Death Trooper.</p>

<p>Other than that, the shots of the shuttle in action is well photographed and the back shows the play features as usual.</p>

<h2><strong>The Instructions</strong></h2>

<p>These were very clear and were easy to follow. The back pages&nbsp;has a checklist for&nbsp;Rogue One&#39;s first wave minifigures, another checklist for wave one&#39;s sets, an CGI action shot, and an add for the Force Builder app. Sadly, the kid screaming WIN on the back cover has been replaced with a random minifigure but I&#39;m sure most people won&#39;t miss him.</p>

<h2><strong>The Parts</strong></h2>

<p>There&#39;s nothing too substantial besides a nice printed canopy and a metallic silver medium blaster. This set defiantly&nbsp;isn&#39;t a parts&nbsp;pack.</p>

<h2><strong>The Build</strong></h2>

<p>The build wasn&#39;t too hard or easy. There was no repetitive parts yet not&nbsp;really any fun ones Overall, it was an alright build.</p>

<h2><strong>The Minifigures</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Director Orson Krennic</strong></h3>

<p>Krennic is absolutely wonderful! His printing, while mostly minimal, fits him well and his cape is the recent spongy material! His accessory is a medium blaster&nbsp;in metallic silver, which has only once appeared in 75103 First Order Transport! Overall, it&#39;s a nice piece to have. Speaking of nice things to have, Krennic is one of them.</p>

<h3><strong>&nbsp;K-2SO</strong></h3>

<p>Ah, K2 is probably the most memorable character in this movie. Not only is he basically a better C-3PO, but he&#39;s an amazing minifigure ... almost.&nbsp;While he looks well asthetically, posing him is a nuisance. His head is molded into his body so no posing&nbsp;there. His torso is based off a battle droid torso so, his legs are molded together so, even less posing. And his arms must be switched from curved to straight for him to hold a weapon so he&#39;s very hard to pose altogether. But, then again, it is a LEGO K-2SO so, get it loose at your own risk. (But, this is mostly&nbsp;from my dislike for the design of LEGO battle droids.)</p>

<h3><strong>Bodhi Rook</strong></h3>

<p>Bodhi is someone you need to look up on a wiki to find out his name but he still is memorable in the movie as a Imperial pilot gone rogue. (Heh heh, rogue. Rogue One. Heh heh.) His minifigure equivalent is very accurate. He has a&nbsp;generator&nbsp;on his back&nbsp;from&nbsp;the final act of the movie and he comes with a double-sided face: One with goggles, one without. For weaponry, he comes with a standard black blaster pistol. Nothing too substantial otherwise. Overall, nothing to rave over but a very accurate minifigure.</p>

<h3><b>Imperial Death Troopers</b></h3>

<p>Ooh, these guys have such an awesome design! But, they are so under utilized in the movie! Anyways, like I said, the troopers have awesome designs and they have translated well into minifigure form. The helmet is a new mold (Which is very nice) and both it and the torso and legs are printed&nbsp;wonderfully. Sadly, the only bad thing about them is that, underneath the helmet, is Angry Clone Face. These guys can also be found in 71615 Imperial Trooper Battle Pack but without the pauldrons they have&nbsp;in this set.&nbsp;If you&#39;re a completionist&nbsp;like me, you&#39;ll want both but I&#39;m sure most people would be fine with the ones in 71615. So, an amazing figure overall!</p>

<h3><strong>Pao</strong></h3>

<p>So, who is this guy again? Seriously, I swear I&#39;ve only saw him for a second in the movie itself but, as a minifigure, I say he&#39;s very memorable. He comes with an entirely&nbsp;new mold for his helmet. (Which is well printed over). His prints are very well detailed and nice to look at (Even with the drab colors) And, the most memorable thing about him is his double-sided head, with one side having a very grumpy/concentrated frown with beady eyes and wrinkles and the other having him SCREAMING! It&#39;s somehow so ridiculous yet hilarious! The only downside about him is his backpack has a sticker on it! Overall, a minifigure that&#39;ll stick out of the crowd.</p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>

<p>These minifigures are a great selection for this set and six is a good number for a $90 set. The only thing I would want to add would be maybe adding Jyn or Cassian in there.</p>

<h2><strong>The Completed Model</strong></h2>

<p>This is a ship that you&#39;ll probably won&#39;t forget from Rogue One and it does very well in LEGO form!</p>

<p>It comes in two different modes: One for landing with two connected technic rails sliding down and the wings (on ball joints) up in the air while the other being for flying with the rails up and the wings down. Unfortunately, with the wings being so huge, it&#39;s very hard to pose without a custom built stand but, playability is great in this mode! Seriously, I swear, you&#39;ll get a sudden urge just to fly this around in circles and trust me, when you do, it&#39;s so satisfying!</p>

<p>There is a landing ramp but it&#39;s very hard to see and also very hard to actually get a minifigure on it. But, I can&#39;t fault this set for not doing something virtually impossible.</p>

<p>Finally, there&#39;s the interior and, oh boy, it&#39;s the weakest part of the build. While the cockpit for Krennic&nbsp;is nicely detailed (The stickers actually do a nice job), once you open up the flaps for the hold, there&#39;s a sudden splotch in color. Particularly red and tan. Seriously, most bricks in tan are randomly put everywhere. The red is shining in from the inner technic but I guess it wasn&#39;t the designer&#39;s fault for not having enough pieces to cover it up. Other than&nbsp;that is some seats for the Death Troopers. I am very disappointed in this and wish LEGO could put somewhat of an effort in it.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

<p>This set is pretty great for both play and display. It looks great and is very &quot;swooshable&quot;. The only downside to it is the interior but other than that, this is a great set for any Star Wars/Rogue One fan. This is defiantly a buy if you have the money!</p>

"dRevan","2017-12-14T16:12:06.86Z","Krennic's Imperial Shuttle","<p>Lego Star Wars: Krennic&#39;s Imperial Shuttle is the largest set from the Rogue One sets. It costs $120 CAD, has 863 pieces and contains 6 figures all of which are exclusive.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong>:<br />
1. Director Krennic: The figure has a rare recolour of the neat hairpiece, appearing a dark tan colour. The face is very reminiscent of the actor and captures the general look impressively. I was disappointed to find that Krennic only has a one-sided face given his importance and exclusivity. His cape is the new spongy fabric material appearing for the first time in white. He is equipped with a silver blaster. His torso is nicely detailed and has the rank insignia as well.<br />
2. K-2SO: The figure is fantastic! The upper body and the head are fused together and contain tremendous amount of detail down to the Imperial logo printed on each arm. He is taller than the normal minifigure which is a nice attention to detail. He comes with some minor printing on the chest representing the circuits in his body.&nbsp;<br />
3. and 4. Imperial Death Troopers (x2): The Death Troopers are the newest addition to the Imperial army. The helmet is exceptionally molded with a small receptor at one end. There is a silver print on the nose and two small green receptors underneath the helmet. The torso and leg printing are equally detailed. The torso has an array of grenades strapped to the suit. Each of the Trooper comes with a black pauldron that goes over the shoulder. Each Trooper is also armed with a black blaster.&nbsp;<br />
5. Pao: The new rebel comes with an exclusive mold for his hat which is molded in tan and nougat colour. His face is very expressive featuring a gruff side and an open-mouthed side. The torso and legs are nicely detailed with some jacket detailing on the torso and simple pants printing on the legs. He comes with a backpack build which has a small antennae possibly to connect with the Rebel base.<br />
6. Bodhi Rook: The last Rebel in the set is a nice figure to add to the Star Wars collection. The face has been printed with goggles one side and a jovial expression on the other. The torso detailing is simple but effective with a simple grey shirt under a brown jacket. Like Pao, Bodhi comes with a backpack although his is less complex.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong>:<br />
The Shuttle is one impressive model. It is very dominant and intimidating. The black colour scheme IMO looks better compared to last year&#39;s Kylo Ren&#39;s Command Shuttle. The geometric build of the Shuttle is very hard to recreate given the nature of Lego bricks and I applaud the designer because the result is beyond awesome.&nbsp;<br />
The front is built using sloped plates to create an A. The entire assembly can be hinged forward or backwards. Inside is a small ramp which can be lowered to allow figures to come inside.<br />
The sides are built using more of the angled triangular plates creating a sharp parallelogram. Each of the sides can hinge forward to allow access inside.&nbsp;<br />
Joining the three segments, sides and the front, is a small canopy piece with an exclusive print. Lifitng the canopy reveals a space for Krennic to sit and pilot the Shuttle.<br />
The interior is very messy due to the somewhat haphazard arrangement of different coloured pieces. However, there are two sets on either side of the ship for the Death Troopers. Krennic&#39;s seat is very regal and has a throne-like appearance. On either side of Krennic&#39;s seat are stairs and stickers are used to provide some more detail.&nbsp;<br />
The vertical fin is very sturdy in its construction and features a red light at the top giving a very menacing look.&nbsp;<br />
The back is hinged just like the side and can be lifted open to reveal four clips to hold blasters. The back has twin engine detailing using 1x4 translucent tiles. The effect is very pleasing to the eye.<br />
The wings like the rest of the build are very sturdy and the wingspan is huge! They are connected via 2 ball joints which give the wings the ability to be raised and lowered recreating Kylo Ren&#39;s Command Shuttle look and also the form seen in Rogue One where the wings are folded down completely forming a triangle. The wings feature two red lights on either side. Underneath each wing is a missile shooter.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong>:<br />
The build is incredible and just like the previous Shuttles is huge! The wingspan is incredible and the complex triangular shape has been recreated perfectly. Moreover the minifigures complement the set however one more figure would have been appreciated.&nbsp;<br />
I picked this set at 50% off which I felt was justified but this set is awesome even at regular price because it feels like a bolder version of last year&#39;s Shuttle albeit at a cheaper price!</p>

This set is the biggest one from the movie wave and it&#39;s the most cool one for me. It&#39;s not just another imperial shuttle, this one is The shuttle. It comprises of 863 pieces and 6 minifigures and retail for about 90Us$/100Eu. It took me slightly more than&nbsp;two hours to build. I have to say the process was somewhat crippled by the 9 stickers and some rather repetitive part like the big wings and the dorsal wing, but just a little.</p>

<p>The minifigures selection is superb. 6 is a good number of characters, and all exclusive as well! The tiny problem here is about the lack of the real pilot of the ship, Captain Dunstig Pterro, which could have been included as well. Doing so this set lets us believe that Krennic itself piloted his ship, but he didn&#39;t, he was just a passenger. But i guess people wouldn&#39;t care too much about another obscure shuttle pilot clad in black. The details about the minifigures are amazing, Pao and Bhodi also have secondary faces, both pretty cool (i love&nbsp;Pao screaming, but actually Bodhi looks too fat). The death troopers are awesome, with a black pauldron and a lot of details going onto the legs, the helmet is perfect. Even Krennic and K-2SO are very well done, the first with a new stye white cape and pearl-grey&nbsp;modified blaster, and the droid has&nbsp;a lot of little details in his new body piece. It&#39;s also very playable since you have 3 rebels and 3 imperials to start a brawl!</p>

<p>The black-pyramid shuttle looks stunning. The shape is perfect, the size is very good, the black is in contrast with some dark&nbsp;grey elements. The dorsal wing is very intricate, build with a lot of little pieces in columns connected together with technic elements. The design makes it imposing and pretty cool. Going onto the main features, on the outside you can raise or lower the landing gear (two skids which work&nbsp;as one with a back connection) and the main landing ramp, which of course doesn&#39;t connect to the inside but still is nice to see. Also you can&nbsp;lower the wings into flying mode very easly, and that&#39;s very cool since they are huge! Once down you can see that it became even taller, reaching a whopping 45cm from top to bottom!! With a nice stand displaying it it will increase its already cool look. In this position it&#39;s very sturdy and easy to fly around to play, and there&#39;s even two spring-loaded red shooters hidden pretty well in the wings, but if you don&#39;t&nbsp;like them (like me sometimes) you can just put them away, so you don&#39;t have to worry about firing them accidentally. Opening the 4 armoured panels reveals the interior (they open nicely, except the main one which covers some of the cabin). And this is very interesting, since there&#39;s actually a lot of space! There are 4 seats, 2 for&nbsp;co-pilots (with the new nice seat without bricks)&nbsp;and 2 more for&nbsp;passengers/prisoners, and upstairs the main white-style seat for the pilot (very cool). There are a lot of stickers here, on the walls as well as for the computers. You also have 6 clips&nbsp;for blaster storage, 4 on the back and 2 for the co-pilots near their seats. Considering the whole structure&nbsp;it&#39;s very sturdy and heavy for the big wings, it&#39;s very good to also have a very nice interior here. Also from the outside it&#39;s possible to see the pilot face thanks to the glass-piece, which works with the&nbsp;other&nbsp;panels to envelop almost entirely the inside, leaving only very minor gaps.</p>

<p>Overall i think this set has almost no cons. The price is fair, the&nbsp;minifigures are great, both collectibles and funny on their own, and the ship is very well done, again both for play and display. You can easy swoosh it around, maybe shoot one or two missiles against&nbsp;some rebel scum, and then close the wings, open the landing craft and land somewhere, where Krennic&nbsp;is about to come and fix problems helped by his deadly commandos!&nbsp;So all in all as a shuttle-lover and shuttle-collector i must say this is my favourite one (for now at least!).&nbsp;It inspires terror and strangeness to the eye, being so big and mysterious and yet very elegant at the same time.&nbsp;It&#39;s a new but already&nbsp;iconic ship for the empire!!</p>
