"Nookman8","2016-08-06T22:22:38.293Z","The Avengers Assemble! ... Literary.","<p>Hello everyone and welcome to another of&nbsp;my reviews. This time, I&#39;m covering &quot;<strong>LEGO Marvel Avengers</strong>&quot; for the PS3.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The cover of the box is nice and could make a good poster if not for the &quot;PS3&quot; logo and all the other symbols on there. On the back is nothing special. It just shows screenshots from the game with some heroes. (None of which I&#39;ve heard of.) It also has some summaries about the game itself.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Controls</h3>

<p>The controls are the same as in every LEGO game. Press X to jump, press Square to attack and hold it to aim with specific characters, press Triangle to switch to the other player and hold it to get a specific one or get another character all together in Free Play or&nbsp;in Manhatten&nbsp;and&nbsp;hubs, and press O to use characters special abilities. You also use it to interact with mission givers, use&quot;Avenger Team-Up&quot; spaces which I&#39;ll talk about later, or finishers. And finally, the analog sticks are used to move around.</p>

<p>All of these controls are nice and responsive.</p>

<p>The Avenger Team-Up spaces (or whatever they&#39;re called) are used to get past certain obstacles with certain members of the Avengers. (No surprise.) For example, if the space asks you to use Thor&#39;s hammer,&nbsp;Mjolnir, and Captain&nbsp;America&#39;s shield, Thor and Captain America will copy the scene in the first Avengers movie when Thor hit Captain&#39;s shield. The resulting blast could&nbsp;&nbsp;break a wall down,&nbsp;knock down a tower, etc. It&#39;s nothing too special and it doesn&#39;t add much.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Levels/Overworld/Hubs</h3>

<p>The levels themselves are nicely designed for the kind of gameplay you working with .. like every other LEGO game. The basics of this are hitting LEGO objects to studs A.K.A currency to buy red bricks and characters in this game, find minikits&nbsp;A.K.A the collectibles in the levels along with red bricks, and finding the cutscene at the end of each segment.&nbsp;They may get repetitive&nbsp;after a while for some people but me on the other hand, enjoy them.There&#39;s also DLC levels but I&#39;ll talk about that later.</p>

<p>The hub worlds are nice inclusions. I find people not really caring for them but I like them as I never really cared for getting yourself lost in a huge forest or something along the likes of that.</p>

<p>Though, the most disappointing thing in this game is Manhattan. They literary just took Manhatten from the last game and gave new missions, collectibles,&nbsp;a couple of new areas to fit in with the MCU, and gave it a sundown backdrop. So basically, they&nbsp;rehashed Manhattan from &quot;<strong>LEGO Marvel Super Heroes</strong>&quot;. *Sigh*&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Graphics</h3>

<p>The graphics are meh on the PS3. The game only runs on 720p&nbsp;instead of the most highest the system can run, 1080p. The models are fine and so are&nbsp;the textures on things.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Sound</h3>

<p>The music from this game comes straight from the MCU movies&#39; soundtracks and I think they&#39;re great ... even after hearing the Avenger&#39;s theme for the one millionth time after you complete a level. The voice actors in this game are great while the rips from the movie are not. Those are very low-quality and sometimes, do now work well as battle cries for characters. (*cough**cough* Black Widow *cough**cough*)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The DLC</h3>

<p>I find the DLC to be well worth your money if you choose to buy it. The additional content is nice and the levels it brings aren&#39;t too shabby either. Character packs in the US&nbsp;vary from being free&nbsp;to&nbsp;$1.99 while level packs are $2.99. Though, I imply you in&nbsp;getting the season pass if you want all the extra content&nbsp;as it&#39;s only $9.99 and it gives you all the DLC for free!&nbsp;Also, no rips are in these so all of the lines in these are voice-acted. (Plus, us Playstation users get&nbsp;an exclusive Ant-Man level pack.)&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I feel like TT kind of rushed this. It&#39;s not garbage by any means but it feels like it doesn&#39;t have a lot of value compared to other games that TT has come out with. So, if you just want this game, then wait till a discount comes around for it or get LEGO Marvel Super Heroes. It&#39;s basically the same the same thing but much cheaper if you&#39;re getting for PS3. I found one at mr local Wal-Mart on the clearance shelf in the video-game aisle.&nbsp;But, if you deciding between this and and any one of the other games TT has come out with this year, put this one&nbsp;behind you and get &quot;<strong>LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens</strong>&quot; or the second wave of &quot;<strong>LEGO Dimensions</strong>&quot; if you don&#39;t care abut using a&nbsp;lot of money on LEGO.</p>

<p>So, in conclusion:</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Nice Gameplay</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>DLC=Cool</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Hub Worlds &amp; Levels Are Great</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Feels Rushed</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Rips Are Bad</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Disappointing Overworld</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, I&#39;ll give this game a 3/5. Thanks for reading this review and I hope you thought it was helpful.</p>
