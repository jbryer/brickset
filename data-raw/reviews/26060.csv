This is 80 minutes long so represents a feature length film of LEGO animation, not a theatrical release, unless it actually did get a release, but a very nice looking special.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Presentation</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a single disc release with a nice enough case, nothing too impressive. The five Friends are on the front with Livi in the corner and the back shows off some shots from the movie and another image of Livi. Very nice release.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">No special Minifigures included with this film. But there is a special passcode to get a free song download from L2M which, sadly, expired in 2017, so if you purchase this new in package in 2020 you won&rsquo;t be able to redeem this code.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Contents</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The special is the only thing included, there are also a few bonus features and music videos, but they chose not to include any LEGO Friends bonus episodes which is a tad of a shame. The menus are fairly standard too, not too interactive. Also no games to play, just some sing alongs, learn how to dance, watch the music video and the special. You&rsquo;ll find a few deleted scenes as well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The CGI Animation LEGO Friends started out with was always more impressive than the stuff that airs these days. I liked the models and character interactions and the use of actual LEGO models to make the CGI, even if the CGI did not look like actual LEGO Mini-Dolls. I was quite entertained by this film and it wasn&rsquo;t too clich&eacute; with introducing a pop singer to Heartlake City. I think the only thing I felt disappointed by was some of the focus on the characters was left out, the deleted scenes are actually fairly interesting though a dad repetitive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">LEGO Friends Girlz 4 Life is a bit of an unfortunate title, as the title for this special doesn&rsquo;t really seem to fit with the narrative. Though I think it is meant to be one of the titles of Livi&rsquo;s songs. But I was highly entertained while watching this. It was highly entertaining and a great introduction for Pop Star Livi. I&rsquo;m confident that any fans of LEGO Friends will enjoy this special and it is definitely worth tracking down if you haven&rsquo;t seen it yet. Strongly Recommended.</p>
