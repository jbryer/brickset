The secondary face is standard, looks like this in movie or on the pack. The body and legs&#39; print are done well too. It&#39;s the only one set, which has a Teapot of Tyrahn (gold teapot with small flame). The minifig has also two &quot;magic whirl&quot; represented by 2x2 dishes with kind of lighting print.</p>

<p>I think this set is very worth buying, especially for someone who collect a Ninjago minifigs.</p>
