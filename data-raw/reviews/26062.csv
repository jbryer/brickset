<p><strong><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></strong></p>

<p>Plain yellow box with a simple scene depicting the small wedding diorama. But the back of the box reveals the real treat of the set. Multiple hair paces and an extra duel faced male head with a stern and a surprised expression.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>By far the parts are the best draw in this set. Outside of the Friends line it is hard to get diamond hearts and plain diamonds in general. This set comes with 2 hearts one light blue one red. 2 diamonds are also graciously included. Additionally 6 sets of hair are also to be found within. 3 for the female and 3 for the male plus a top hat! The alternate faced male head is also a great treat. Another great treat is the inclusion of 3 golden ring pieces which I had not seen outside of the Lord Of the Rings or Hobbit line.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>2 Minifigures are included. A groom with 2 head pieces (one bearded and one with face print either side). A bride with a plain white slope piece for legs. The only shame in the selection is the lack of print on the bride&#39;s slope piece. Her torso print is so good the plain slope really stands out as lacking.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>Quick little build but very well thought out. Very enjoyable to put together specially when you start putting in the trans-clear pieces. It really makes this little set pop!</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>It looks nice next to real wedding pictures and is just an adorable set to behold for the instantly recognizable setting and theme.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>A wonderful set for couples who also happen to be LEGO fans or would-be couples who you know enjoy LEGO. But also great for MOCs for the inclusion of so many hair pieces, trans clear pieces, plants bouquet pieces and those golden rings. If you can get multiples of these the better. The parts can add variety to other scenes or themes you already own.&nbsp;</p>
