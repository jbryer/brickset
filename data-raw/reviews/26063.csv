<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The polybag is normally something that I open and toss. &nbsp;But because this one has the iconic Batman series logo, and the fabulous &quot;ZZZZZWAP!&quot; effect, it&#39;s a keeper.<br />
<br />
The instructions are ... well, instructions. &nbsp;No departure from usual polybag directions.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are fun. &nbsp;The freeze gun and backpack have all the over-done charm of 1960&#39;s science fiction. &nbsp;Big. &nbsp;Bulky. &nbsp;The absolute opposite of slick and elegant. &nbsp;And, there are like five or six extra pieces, including a wind-up key. &nbsp;Not bad for a small part count set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Otto Preminger is totally reborn in this fun little figure. &nbsp;It&#39;s got the three dials from his freeze collar, and the print is carried over onto the back. &nbsp;And those eyebrows! &nbsp;Oh, those lovely, bushy eyebrows! &nbsp;Attention to detail on par with Ceasar Romero&#39;s makeup-covered moustache. &nbsp;This is real love for fans right here.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>You get more build than you typically do in polybag minifigures. &nbsp;The gun doesn&#39;t exactly attach to the pack. &nbsp;It&#39;s connected by the hose, but the back of the blue stock seems like it really should be hooked to something. &nbsp;But that&#39;s only a minor fault, and hardly a deal-breaker.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>He just looks so fabulous mingled in on my shelf with the rest of the Rogues Gallery. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I knew I had to have this once I saw the first picture, and I&#39;m so glad I managed to add him to my collection.</p>

<p>This is a great value for a polybag minifigure. &nbsp;It&#39;s a lovely homage to a camp classic. &nbsp;No true nerd is complete without it.</p>

<p>Get it now before the resale value goes through the roof. &nbsp;If you have the 76052 Batcave, you simply MUST have Mr. Freeze.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-01-29T18:52:35.443Z","WHAM, POW! It's Classic Mr. Freeze, Batman.","<p><strong>Set #30603 Batman Classic TV Series Mr. Freeze:</strong> One of the longest names for an official Polybag out there, this little gem was a free giveaway last year from LEGO S&amp;H and it was a brilliant decision to make him available.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeze represents the version as seen in the Adam West 1960&#39;s era Television Series, as such he&#39;s a bit more campy looking compared to the other Mr. Freeze minifigures we&#39;ve gotten. His torso is double-sided with a nice print that shows the jumpsuit he mostly wore with some extra tech detailing around the neck for where his cooling unit was kept. He has no helmet, just a simple cooling unit so you can see his face, which includes large bushy eyebrows... for the life of me I can&#39;t recall the original actor&#39;s name.</p>

<p>Unique to this Free Minifigure is a buildable freeze gun with back bracket for mounting, it&#39;s a clever little build that features a wind-up key and some antifreeze canisters or something to launch concentrated freeze rays at Batman. It&#39;s been a long time since I saw the television series so I can&#39;t recall the original interpretation before Paul Dini and friends changed up his origins in the 90&#39;s, either way this is a fun little build using some clever techniques to make it resemble something you&#39;d find on the set of a 1960&#39;s television production. Very low tech.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a great figure and I&#39;d recommend tracking this beauty down if you missed it the first time, it&#39;ll go great with the Classic Series Batcave as an extra villain. Highly recommended.</p>
