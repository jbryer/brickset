<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Comes in a polybag, and has instructions on a single piece of paper</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Comes with Cap&#39;s shield and a black motorcycle with red wheels, which are good additions to the minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Cap minifig is the same one from the Age of Ultron sets, but it is still good. It has nice torso and head printing, though it isn&#39;t accurate to his Civil War uniform. Unfortunately, he has no leg printing, and the skin tone on his face comes off as very dark, rather than the light skin tone Chris Evans has.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The sidecar build is nice, and provides a holder for the shield and a flick-fire missile, which is good for play.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>For a polybag, it is a build that can be used in Marvel MOCs and displays without sticking out, and it looks nice.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>For just 4 dollars, this is a great way to get a Cap minifigure if you don&#39;t have one already, and some nice parts.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2016-12-21T15:29:12.973Z","Decent Freebie from LEGO","<p><strong>Set #30447 Captain America&rsquo;s Motorcycle:</strong> This is a pretty fun little polybag, though it&rsquo;s somewhat repetitive as far as models go, however we&rsquo;ll go over the pros and cons and then discuss the conclusion after that.</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Given away free at LEGO S&amp;H.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Features a nice looking motorcycle with side car attachment.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Cheap way to pick up Captain America in his Civil War outfit.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Not a lot of pieces for the side car, so another Minifigure can&rsquo;t sit in it, as it is small and features a flick-fire missile.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Not worth more than 5$ on the secondary market in my opinion because of how few parts are included there.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Honestly there wasn&rsquo;t much to say about this, there is very little to build, it&rsquo;s a bit of a change from other Polybag, and it is nice as a freebie, but I wouldn&rsquo;t pay too much for it on the secondary market, Cap can be found in regular retail sets without too much difficulty and there isn&rsquo;t anything unique to the print, the bike is nice and includes a nice spot to put the shield when Cap&rsquo;s driving, however I&rsquo;ve seen better polybags come out of the Super Heroes theme. So I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s safe to skip this one if you missed it originally.</p>

"vikings","2020-05-25T05:41:56.11Z","Cap's Cycle","<p><strong>Box/Instruction:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a polybag with the normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You don&#39;t get any cool or unique sets. The red rims for the bike were a cool color for this piece. The total piece count for the set is 25 (Which is pretty low, even for a polybag).&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigure:</b></p>

<p><b>Captain America:</b></p>

<p>Captain America is great figure to get (Especially this cheap). He comes with his normal head with a printed on mask with the silver A in the middle of his forehead. The printing on his torso is amazing. The straps,&nbsp;armor, and ab printing is just outstanding. He has plain dark blue legs, I would have liked some printing on his legs due to this not being a great polybag.&nbsp;He&nbsp;is armed with his classic shield.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:</b></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:</b></p>

<p>Overall not the greatest of polybags. Getting Cap in a cheap set is nice. The bike isn&#39;t bad. The sidecar is armed with a flick missile. The red rims of the bike is really cool and adds some color to it. Captain America has great torso printing. Since this isn&#39;t a great polybag a little extra printing on his legs would have been nice to have added to him. Overall this isn&#39;t a must-have set, but this is a great way to get a Captain America minifigure for cheap. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 3-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
