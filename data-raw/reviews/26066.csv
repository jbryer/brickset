<h2>Pros:</h2>

<p>- Not the normal&nbsp;&quot;thug, thief&quot; concept. The figures are good. It&#39;s not the widest selection, but the figures works fine with the rest of the play-set(s).</p>

<p>- Some larger builds, and more parts. The parts in the set are not&nbsp;<em>great</em>, but totally fine.</p>

<p>- Some unique parts, like the huskey, guitar and minifigure parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Cons:</h2>

<p>- The instructions are terrible (day 11, was impossible to build...).</p>

<p>- There are nothing&nbsp;<em>special&nbsp;</em>with the builds, they are boring and i think they are not &quot;Christmas&quot;... It&#39;s nothing new to this calendar, just the old boring stuff, like 2005, 2009, 2011 and 2013 was FANTASTIC!</p>

<p>- The value aren&#39;t good at all! Except the mentioned parts, this could be priced at 15$.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Total thoughts:</h2>

<p>Well, i think this might be the worst city calendar so far... Not awful, but not good either. 4/10 for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Thanks for reading, (please remember these are my thoughts, so before dislike, remember we have diffrent&nbsp;opinion!) Thx in advance.</em></p>

"bobz","2016-12-26T00:25:03.187Z","Kids oriented, Kids like it","<p><strong>First</strong> lets be clear, this is not for AFOL. This is for kids and kids like it. First thing my 4 years old son did when he woke&nbsp;up every december morning is picking up is LEGO Advent calendar.</p>

<p><strong>Pro</strong></p>

<p>-Kids like it</p>

<p>- Dog and Santa Claus</p>

<p><strong>Con</strong></p>

<p>-Terrible value for the money. I would never pay 40$+tx CAD for this. Found it for 25 from a reseller which&nbsp;is decent i guess.</p>

<p>-plan, well there is just no plan. You have to look on the small door to build it, can be hard for kids.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: Now that my son had this calendar he will want one next years...but only if i can find it cheaper than msrp.</p>
