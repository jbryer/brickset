<p>Connecting the diggers and crane arms was very difficult for him when we first got this, but a year later it is fairly easy.&nbsp; The fact that they can combined in multiple ways and to create multiple robot body is parts is fantastic.</p>

<p>I highly recommend for any kid that loves robots or Miles, truly a fantastic set!</p>
