<p>At 13 parts there really isn&#39;t much to it, and while there are no build instructions, they aren&#39;t really needed - the picture on the foil pack is sufficient, and the build takes only a few moments.</p>

<p>We have Lance, with armour printing and wearing an armour piece, but this time with&nbsp;blond hair and no helmet. His head has a second face print on the back - a winking expression matching that of the cartoon figure on the front of the foil pack.</p>

<p>He also comes with a 3 piece lance (his signature weapon), and a mini table with a croissant, a bottle and a goblet.</p>

<p>Compared to the price of a collectible mini figures, the value for money is pretty good for just the figure, and while the magazine is most definitely for kids, its not without entertainment value for older fans.</p>
