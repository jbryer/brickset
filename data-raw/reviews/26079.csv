HE has 4 pieces which are mostly detailed greatly. Legs, torso/wing-arms, face, and chicken &#39;mask&#39;. when it comes to cute costumed mini figures i personally love changing their faces to fit my scenes (example: putting a screaming face on the banana minifig&nbsp;because he was just dumped into the garbage truck). His best feature is definitely&nbsp;the wings. They have good mobility and are also satisfyingly&nbsp;textured.&nbsp;</p>

(which is the main part) ","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong> : Nothing special in fact, a CMF in a cardboard box but a great collectors item !! The box is the main part of this cute &quot;Easter&quot; gift. Not officially for sale but a gift in Holland if you buy for more than &euro; 50,00. The lay-out is adorable, happy to own it.</p>

<p><strong>Building 1 brick</strong> : Really nothing to built, just an already assembled mini figure in a box.</p>

<p><strong>Parts&nbsp;4 bricks</strong> : I give 5 bricks for mostly the box and the mini figure and I distract 1 brick due to the lack of the small baseplate. The Iconic Easter minifigure is not really special either, it is the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/71000-7/Chicken-Suit-Guy"">2013 Chicken Suit Guy.</a></p>

<p><strong>Playability 4 bricks</strong> : As it is nothing special but the empty box offers the opportunity to built a small interior. So the 4 bricks are for the possibilities it offers.</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks</strong> : Since I got it for free and small sets like this only increase in value because they are not for sale 5 bricks.</p>
