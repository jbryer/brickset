"Odeinoichus","2017-01-29T18:21:26.703Z","Free Gift with Purchase","<p><strong>Set #30601 Scooby-Doo:</strong> There isn&#39;t much to discuss with Scooby here as he isn&#39;t a typical Minifigure design, basically this is the free Polybag included with the LEGO Scooby-Doo Blu-Ray Special Haunted&nbsp;Hollywood and it is a bit of a disappointment.</p>

<p>LEGO could have included a new character from the special, but instead of giving us the&nbsp;main villain unmasked or one of the other digital only characters they present a lazy re-use of parts from LEGO Scooby-Doo sets to give us the titular hound, Scooby uses the standing torso with one leg raised and the head piece with the tongue sticking out of the side of the mouth.</p>

<p>I call this lazy, but it is a decent item. If younger fans of Scooby just want the LEGO Scooby-Doo character getting the film will ensure that for a decent price, sadly if you collect the entire Theme you&#39;ll have six Scooby-Doo figures already and can just mix-and-match parts from those sets to get this exact same version. So my final thoughts for this free polybag is, perhaps if they were going to stick with Scooby as a giveaway they could have at least included a build with him, as it is I can&#39;t recommend this item as one you need to track down. It&#39;s a decent enough free item, but disappointing in the execution.</p>

"Minifig290","2018-02-13T18:41:48.85Z","Good DVD Promo","<p>This set was released in conjunction with the first LEGO Scooby-Doo DVD in 2016. In the UK the DVD and this polybag was released at Sainsbury&#39;s and Amazon, and i believe Amazon.com was the only place in the US that stocked this bundle.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The figure consist of 2 pieces the head and body, the head print is exclusive to this figure as he has his tongue sticking out and has crossed eyes. Scooby&#39;s torso isn&#39;t exclusive but is always cool to get, his tail is a rubbery material and the rest of his figure is plastic.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To conclude this review it is a great promotion to get with a&nbsp;good DVD, and for the retail price of &pound;7 it is worth purchasing, but if you haven&#39;t got this already the polybag sells for ridiculous amounts on Bricklink and eBay</p>

<p><strong>Pros- &nbsp;</strong>Exclusive head piece and great figure</p>

<p><b>Cons- </b>Availability and after market price</p>
