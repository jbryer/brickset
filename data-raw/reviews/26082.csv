Eh, not so much. I love anything Halloween so I had to have this.&nbsp; Despite the fact that it only has 150 pieces it took me nearly 2 hours to build. The vampire was fascinating to put together, great use of &quot;normal&quot; pieces.&nbsp; I had to rebuild his head twice though as the directions weren&#39;t quite clear enough for me. (!)</p>

<p>Love the colors - lavender and purple with black.</p>

<p>And the bat?&nbsp; Yeah, he&#39;s awesome!</p>
