<p>For true minifig collectors, I would call this a Figbait item, Figurine Bait where you only want the minifig as opposed to anything that comes with it.</p>

<p>For all Nightwing fans, you&rsquo;ll probably know this is only the 3rd time Nightwing appears in the LEGO minifig world. The first being in 2006 (7758) and last seen in in 2014 (76011) thus making this a rather rare release.</p>

<p>Box/Polybag<br />
The typical minifigure display that comes with a DVD/Blu-Ray is now no longer displayed in a blister pack that&rsquo;s usually placed up front center on the box packaging. LEGO has taken the time to actually issue this piece in a polybag fully stuffed into a dedicated enclosure in the box.</p>

<p>Contents<br />
The Polybag contains the 6 elements that make up the figure and a folded insert to further tease you with their other recent releases</p>

<p>Minifigure Parts<br />
Nightwing comes with a dual expression head element and a printed torso (front and back) the printed shape is a replica of the 76001 release with the exception that it now comes in blue instead of red.</p>

<p>The blue print goes back to the original blue origins symbol instead of the red print probably inspired by the The New 52 introduced in 2011.</p>

<p>The primary weapon of Nightwing are the Escrima Sticks are represented by two transparent light blue &ldquo;Light Sword&rdquo;.</p>

<p>The Movie<br />
What&rsquo;s interesting is that in the LEGO movie, the Nightwing that&rsquo;s featured is the 76011 release with the red symbol and red eyes. Gotham City Breakout is worth a watch and has its funny moments and worth a watch for a relaxing no-brainer day. Not giving away any spoilers, but I&rsquo;m awaiting the big-fig version of the enemy featured in this movie, I think it&rsquo;s an appropriate figure for the big-fig and one that&rsquo;s overdue!&nbsp;<i>??</i></p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Minifig 4/5 - Must own for any Nightwing fan<br />
Movie 3.5/5 - Lighthearted movie to watch on a Lazy Sunday</p>

<p>Aside from the colours this version of Nightwing is identical to the version found in the 2014 Man-Bat Attack set, here he has the more traditional (I think) blue version of his logo printed on his chest and back. The head printing, the hair piece, the basic design of the torso print everything else is identical to the design found on the Nightwing figure from 2014. If you missed out on him then this is a great way to get the character, if you already own one unless you&#39;re going 100% for DC Super Hero minifigures it&#39;s an easy pass.</p>

<p>Something I neglected to mention though, with this and the previous two Minifigure Polybags LEGO included small pamphlets showcasing the sets from the DC Super Hero line, as well as build instructions of course for the Classic Mr. Freeze weapon. Not much to say about them, probably why I forgot. Anyway, this is hesitantly recommended and mostly for fans of the line as noted above.</p>
