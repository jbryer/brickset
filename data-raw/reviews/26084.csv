<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Model is very impressively designed and works great as a play element.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Stephanie mini-doll has nice re-use of parts which have been seen before. Print detailing impresses.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Play feature works surprisingly well.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>New Hot Dog Bun piece included.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Easy to lose pins and ball when playing with.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Model uses too few pieces, gutter elements would make for a better design choice to ensure that the parts do not get lost.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>New ticket piece not included with this polybag from this sub-theme of LEGO Friends.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>I feel this set is one that stands out mostly for being the cheapest method to find the new hot dog bun piece. Everything else about this polybag is really lackluster and while the play feature works most of the time it is unfortunate that younger fans could easily lose the ball or pins while pretending to have Stephanie bowl. Great for parts, not so great as a model. Mildly recommended.</p>
