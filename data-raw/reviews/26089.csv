<p>The first time I saw this set was on LEGO.com and I thought it was simply grand.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box of this set is very charming and fun. In the background there is a picture of the Big-Ben set, and a road in London somewhere. It says on the box that it goes good with the Big-Ben set, so that&rsquo;s why they show it on the box. The box is a smaller box, but it&rsquo;s fatter than most boxes that size. The instructions are fine and easy to read like most, so there&#39;s not much to say about that.</p>

<h3>The Parts &nbsp; &nbsp;</h3>

<p>Most of the parts in this set are red (as you can see), but there are some tan and transparent white pieces. Now, it does include stickers.</p>

<p>I know some people hate putting them on. I do not agree. I must say that they can be very annoying at times trying to get them on so perfectly. But I enjoy the challenge of applying the stickers to the bricks. However I did not like how they will some times peel at the corners and won&rsquo;t go back down. There are some newer tires in this set that I think look way better than the older ones. This is not the first appearence&nbsp;of these tires.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The build was fun, mostly building upwards on the exterior, since it is a&nbsp;<i>Double-</i>Decker bus. It was very well built and VERY sturdy. I accidentally dropped it from standing height, on to a wood surface. It&nbsp;stayed&nbsp;in one piece (mostly).</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Over all I really enjoyed this set, it&rsquo;s fun and even though a minifigure can not fit I like to use it with them anyway. I would recommend getting this set if you can get it for a reasonable price. I got it for free so I can&rsquo;t complain about the price.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The Bus</li>
	<li>Very well built</li>
	<li>The tires</li>
	<li>&nbsp;All the smooth tiles&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Stickers (for most people)</li>
	<li>Figures can&rsquo;t fit</li>
</ul>

"Kris_PL","2017-01-21T19:13:41.46Z","Iconic London Bus","<p>This little LEGO set was available free with purchases in the LEGO Store last year. I was lucky enough to get one and i have to say, it looks splendid. The bus takes around 10-15 min. to assemble. Its a very easy build with no surprises. There are 5 stickers that need to be applied.</p>

<h2>Overall opinion</h2>

<p>Personally, it was a the best giveaway item of 2016. It&#39;s relatively small size fits on any office desk, however it&#39;s a stand alone model. It doesn&#39;t fit into the lego city or next to architecture sets. Nevertheless, i love how little it is. It also doesn&#39;t scream LEGO. It might as be a souvenir from a London trip.The stickers on the bus reference other sets and they add a bit of fun to the look of the model. it&#39;s a great set, which is purely for display purposes, but is still really fun to look at and roll around.</p>

"Broa_Island","2018-07-13T03:13:42.5Z","A small, but interesting set.","<p>Set number&nbsp;40220, the London Bus, is a small but rare set that I&nbsp;didn&#39;t know the existence of until yesterday! apparently, this set was a LEGO store exclusive, given away with qualified&nbsp;purchases in 2016. Now the set goes for&nbsp;about $60 on Ebay. the story of how I got my hands on this set is a weird one, but first, the review!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model itself is 4 studs wide and about 12 studs long. In my opinion, the red bricks used make the model look gorgeous! the clear bricks used to portray the windows are also pretty amazing, considering that I don&#39;t have that many clear 1x2 bricks.</p>

<p>My favorite part of the set is the decals, on the left-hand side of the model, there is a movie poster for a monster movie called &quot;The Brick Separator&quot;! that&#39;s some LEGO humor right there. the poster shows a minifigure&nbsp;running from a monster with a head that looks like the brick separator piece that comes in most LEGO sets.&nbsp;On the right-hand side of the model is a poster for the Elizabeth&nbsp;Tower (Which, if people didn&#39;t know, is the true name of Big Ben). The decals on the&nbsp;front and back&nbsp;of the model are showing people the town where the bus is going to next, the LEGO group chose Westminster for the model.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>overall: the is a neat little&nbsp;modal that reminds&nbsp;me of another London&nbsp;Bus that was released&nbsp;in the 1970&#39;s. If you can get your hands on it, take that chance, you won&#39;t be disappointed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>14/20</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>as for how I got this set? well, the LEGO store in Dreamworld&nbsp;Australia were selling them for $20 and&nbsp;I picked one up,&nbsp;I only learned about the set&#39;s history after I got home.</p>

"1947andallthat","2018-08-29T14:47:16.273Z","High quality AND rare","<p>I believe that high quality souvenirs are worth picking up from memorable experiences; thus, buying this was an integral part of my recent visit to Leicester Square. I was suitably impressed in store, but what is it actually like?</p>

<p><strong>Box &amp; Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The small box contains two unnumbered bags, a single instruction book and a small sheet of stickers.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Nothing to it, really. Took around fifteen minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Nothing really exciting here either. The only part with any rarity is the red 2x4 bracket, which only appears in eleven other sets.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>For such a small scale, this is a perfect replica of a Routemaster. Virtually every detail which could have been captured at this scale is here; a rear number plate, a radiator, lights front and back, signs for route number (the 211 is actually a real route through Westminster, although it doesn&#39;t actually terminate there and I found no reference to a &quot;b&quot; route on the TFL website), and advertisements. The only thing missing is the front number plate, although, unlike the back, I think including the plate would have ruined the look of the radiator. The stickers add a lot to the model, including the advertisements, one for Big Ben and a superb one for LEGO Studios&#39; &quot;The Brick Separator&quot;. The interior has no details, but I struggle to see a way how the two-stud-wide space inside could support a full interior, so I am actually quite pleased the detail has been omitted and, presumably, the cost kept down; there is still a nicely placed door at the back.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>I can&#39;t fault this set, really. The exterior of the Routemaster&nbsp;has been captured almost perfectly for microscale, and it is currently serving as a fitting memento of our London trip. The set itself probably does not warrant &pound;10, but the exclusivity makes up the cost in my opinion, so I would definitely recommend buying this if you ever get to Leicester Square.</p>
