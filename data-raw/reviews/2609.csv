I thought it was a nice addition to my collection. I got it second hand, because it was already out of stores a long time ago.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For several diameters you will receive tired and rims, which can also be mixed. The silver color is not often used (anymore) in parts.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The tires and rims look good, but keep in mind that if you want to use them for driving on other materials than the table or rugs, please read the info on the link below first. It is about the traction of all tires and rims Lego has made. If it is just about spicing up a fast car: wonderful.</p>
