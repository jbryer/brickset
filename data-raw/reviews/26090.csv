"lentil","2017-03-02T15:40:20.52Z","Cute and Bright","<p>I picked up this small promotional set at a recent trip to TrU. The set contains a very cute brick-built Geoffrey figure, plus two child minifigures.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Numerous bricks, plates, and tiles in cheery flame yellowish orange, with some brown, orange, and yellow accents. Overall a bright and attractive color palette.</li>
	<li>A fair number of SNOT and hinge pieces are included as well.</li>
	<li>A fun and quick build</li>
	<li>Geoffrey is so stinkin cute!</li>
	<li>Two minifigs are included - a little boy with a spaceman shirt and a little girl with a green and lavender jumping dolphin top.</li>
	<li>Geoffrey&#39;s limbs are very articulated and posable - he has joints at his hips, knees, ankles, shoulders, wrists, tail (2), ears, and jaw. All except ears and jaw are rotating ball joints, so you can move them every which way. He&#39;s pretty goofy looking to begin with, but it&#39;s easy to enhance this by putting him in various silly positions.</li>
	<li>Did I mention how darn cute he is? Even his teeth are cute!</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The stars all over his body (front, back, and sides) are all stickers. I counted 18 total, which is pretty ridiculous for such a small set.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall it&#39;s a cute little set, and I think a very good value for the money considering all the pieces and the two minifigs. Geoffrey is cheery, fun to pose, and will probably make you giggle.</p>

<p>Parts and playability are ok for Geoffrey, but has a bit lacking with the joints due to his body. The body is a bit too buff, which limits the movements from his arms and legs.&nbsp;Building experience was good as you&#39;re building the mascot of Toy r Us. It&#39;s a good price also for $10 with three characters. Those stickers should&#39;ve been printed though.</p>
