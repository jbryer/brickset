<h3>This is another great book from DK on the DC Super Heroes and villains.</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>it comes with the new pirate batman thats exclusive to this book, we were introduced to this batman in the Cosmic Clash DVD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As Batman had to travel back in time, and ended up in a pirate outfit as with other outfits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mini Fig has great detail on torso and legs and rear torso but no side printing on legs and arms,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has an alternate face print, and two weapons as props.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flicking though this book will not disappoint the super hero fan or Lego Fan alike, with detailed pictures of heroes and foes with information of likes and dislikes&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>of each character, Friends, Foes Skills, Gear.&nbsp;</p>

Excellent Book.","<p><strong>LEGO DC Comics Super Heroes Character Encyclopedia:</strong> In keeping with DK Publishing products of the past from numerous themes we are given the first official Character Encyclopedia for DC Comics Super Heroes. Hopefully we&rsquo;ll see a Marvel equivalent in the very near future. Something also to note, this will no doubt receive an Updated and Expanded edition at some point in the future, similar to how LEGO Star Wars gave us a new version updated with more figures.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the discussion of the book and the exclusive Minifigure and then the overall thoughts on this title.</p>

<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>To start this review off we&rsquo;ll discuss the overall presentation, which is fairly common for a book of this type. We&rsquo;ve got the plain white hard cover with images of heroes on top and villains on the bottom, and directly in the center rounding off everything nicely is Pirate Batman.</p>

<p>The back cover shows even more villains and heroes in Minifigure form. And of course gives the write-up on the contents of the book. Honestly these books all look different because of the character choices, however they all look the same as well because of the uniform white covers, which look great on a shelf together. The placement of the Minifigure in a prominent position on the front also adds to the visual appeal of the book, attracting the eye and ensuring your young readers will go straight for it when in the store.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Pirate Batman: This is a great looking variant of Batman, based on how he looks in the Cosmic Clash DVD special, Pirate Batman is dressed in a period based version of his standard Bat costume. He&rsquo;s got a double-sided torso print dressed in a grey pirate jacket with a huge bat symbol on his back, his utility belt is wrapped around his torso instead of his waistline because he&rsquo;s got a dark blue sash around the waist. The legs include a bit of printing with some of the jacket hanging down and the tops of his period piece dark blue boots visible.</p>

<p>The cape is the newer softer material which helps hold its shape better and he also comes with the new cowl piece in a rich dark blue colour, he&rsquo;s also got a pirate sword and a flail weapon for his accessories, the head is the standard double-sided print style with your typical Batman expressions on a dark blue head, just all around a great looking Minifigure.</p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>

<p>Here we&rsquo;ll get into greater detail on the contents. As with many of the past offerings this book gives you a look at every Minifigure released in the Theme up to a given point depending on print date. This book not only touches upon the characters as they were re-imagined with the 2012 Theme, but also give you a good look at the sets and figures from the original Batman Theme in 2006.</p>

<p>There are 208 pages in this book and a vast majority of them are taken up with images of the Minifigures and fun little write-ups on each character. Some of the accuracy of these write-ups can be questionable at times, not due to misprint errors, though I&rsquo;m certain a few slipped by, but due to the fact that certain characters are conspicuous due to their absence. And others are identified incorrectly, the most prominent of which is The Trickster, who is said to be a teenaged villain, when that is clearly not the case.</p>

<p>What I mean by absence is mostly variants, while there are many dedicated pages to a lot of Minifigures some of the variants are not given a separate page, and this is fine, as the book would include far too many pages otherwise. And yet, when it comes to the Set Showcase on the back few pages on the book this becomes an oddity, they start off by showing all of the releases by year, and yet after 2012 they seem to be a lot more selective on which Polybags are shown.</p>

<p>Notable absences for Polybags include Joker&rsquo;s Bumper Car, the Microbuilds of the Batwing and the Tumbler, Robin&rsquo;s Redbird Cycle, the Martian Manhunter free give away, which is mentioned on the Martian Manhunter&rsquo;s character page, but they don&rsquo;t include an image of it in the back of the book for whatever reason. This is extremely odd as the 2012 page lists every set released in that year, including all of the Polybags.</p>

<p>This brings to mind the question of why most people enjoy these books, and for the most part the content is very well chosen and written, you&rsquo;ll even find an interview in the back of the book with one of the model designers and the senior graphic designer, so there is something here for fans of the Theme outside of just getting another exclusive Minifigure. I do wish they&rsquo;d implement spacing better though when it comes to set showcases, a lack of Polybags is common in many of these books, however it is still disappointing. While I know the images and information is easily obtained through the internet sometimes you just want to open a physical book and peruse everything, a throwback to the catalogues of the past as it were.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>A very enjoyable book which includes an excellent variant of the caped crusader. I wholeheartedly recommend this title if you haven&rsquo;t already picked it up. Good job DK and I look forward to seeing a LEGO Marvel version of this book in the coming years.</p>

This is a good minifigure to get for collectors, but not much use other than that. It has good detailing and exclusive prints, but it isn&#39;t too exciting other than that. The book has some good information on some DC characters in their minifigure&nbsp;form, but there are so many mistakes that it drove me crazy. I would only recommend this if you want the minifigure, but you would&nbsp;be better off buying the minifigure&nbsp;online without the book. It would save you money and shelf space.</p>
