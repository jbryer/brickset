<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE BOX&hellip;ER, BAG AND&hellip;NO INSTRUCTIONS.</p>

<p>since the set consists of one minifigure, there&rsquo;s no need for instructions, so let&rsquo;s just look a the packaging. The package is a plastic bag, hence the name polybag. It features Kylo Ren in one corner, the Lego logo in the other and the Star Wars logo in the center. Down beneath that, we see the stormtrooper charging into battle from what appears to be a troop transporter. Judging from the blue lasers flying around and the explosion in the background, the fight has been going for awhile already. Our stormtrooper must have been in the back of the transporter, patiently waiting to wreak havoc on any and all Resistance troops. Continuing down the package, we see a silver seal stating that this is a 2016 exclusive.</p>

<p>The back of the bag is fairly boring, showing the seal again in two different languages, where the parts were made and a bunch of other numbers and words that nobody ever reads. The boring back is fine, since the front looks so cool.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s move on.</p>

<p>THE MINIFIGURE</p>

<p>Now, I understand that a lot of people would have liked to see a more unique minifigure, but Lego decided to go with this. Just because he&rsquo;s not super unique doesn&rsquo;t mean he&rsquo;s a bad or useless figure. He&rsquo;s a stormtrooper, for goodness sakes! You can never have too many Stormtroopers, so he&rsquo;s probably more useful than some other, more obscure Star Wars character. Plus, he was a freebie, so stop complaining!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/m7s90fcur/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look. At first glance, our trooper seems to be just another heavy artillery trooper. Well, look closer. He&rsquo;s not. There are some differences: he has an additional ammo pouch attached to his heavy ammo harness, hinting that he is some sort of commander.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/veajnpi37/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The white boxes attached to his harness are lower down and smaller. His legs are the same as the other First Order Stormtroopers, as is the helmet. His head is just angry clone again. Lego seriously needs to phase out angry clone and start using stern clone instead. Our trooper is equipped with some type of armored combat backpack that makes use of the printed tile from the First Order Snowtroopers.</p>

<p>If only Lego would have included a pauldron, solidifying his rank. Oh well. Just one step beneath perfect. I can deal with that (or just go buy a pauldron).</p>

<p>OVERALL</p>

<p>So overall, I have to agree with Jangbricks. A stormtrooper is a very non-controversial figure, (or would be if everyone just stopped complaining that Lego didn&rsquo;t give them a controversial minifigure) He&rsquo;s useful and he&rsquo;s just the right amount of exclusive to keep his price from shooting way up on the secondary market. I really like this Trooper, especially since he&rsquo;s the first TFA Stormtrooper I&rsquo;ve gotten.</p>

<p>PROS: Awesome ammo harness</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Great Backpack, plus the extra (oh yeah, did I forget to mention that? You get an extra neck bracket and printed tile too)</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Usefulness level 100%</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just awesome overall</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>CONS: Looks like he should have a pauldron but doesn&rsquo;t (easily remedied)</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Angry clone, again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I won&rsquo;t be so pushy as to say &ldquo;go buy one&rdquo;. Maybe my review hasn&rsquo;t changed your mind and you still hate him. That&rsquo;s fine. Maybe you&rsquo;re happy with the heavy artillery trooper from the Battlepack or the Quadjumper. That&rsquo;s cool too. But if you are leaning toward trying to get one, then I say, do it! Last I check, he was only $6-7 on Bricklink. For those of you who still hate him, just be nice about it please? There are some of us who do like him.</p>
