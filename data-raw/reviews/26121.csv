<p>This small promotional set comes with the &#39;LEGO Star Wars Magazine&#39;, which is of course an official magazine as this is official LEGO. It is based on the Naboo&nbsp;N-1 Starfighter for &#39;The Phantom Menace&#39; and &#39;Attack of the Clones&#39;.</p>

<p>One thing I found very interesting by just looking at the set image, it is almost too similar too similar to the mini Nabbo Starfighter that was shown in 9674, Nabbo Starfighter and Naboo&nbsp;which was part of the planet series. I will talk about this in &#39;The completed model&#39; section.</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The box is the same as it has always been with these magazines, a small reflective&nbsp;plastic package selotaped to the front of the magazine.</p>

<p>Unlike the last set, Luke&#39;s Landspeeder, the instructions were at the front of the magazine, not near the back in a random position.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>This set being an exclusive addition to these magazines, had no exclusive parts or parts in new colors. (as it is nearly a clone of the planet series one, talked about in &#39;The completed model&#39; section)</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>The build was easy, with a nice 34 pieces. The build starts of using three dark grey pieces which I talk about in &#39;The completed model&#39;. The build is not unique, and i&#39;m sure it is very similar to the planet series one.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>Let&#39;s get right into talking about how this is nearly identical to 9674&#39;s mini Naboo Starfighter. The only differences are the tail and front. The tail does not use a yellow 1x1 cone piece like the original one did.The front does not used the curved engraved piece like the original one did. I don&#39;t know how to quite explain it, but the center bit underneath the the cockpit is definitely built differently. The nose of the ship has the wing pieces below the 2x3 piece with the hole, when the original one has the wings on top of the 2x3 piece.&nbsp;The last difference is there are studs in&nbsp;front of the transparent cheese slope representing the cockpit, where the planet series version is flat. The chrome 1x1 stud is supposed to act as an astromech droid, most likely R2-D2, but to be honest it doesn&#39;t&nbsp;really do it for me. The ship uses three dark grey pieces on the bottom to make the build easier, but they are straight up ugly. I personally removed them myself.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion</strong></h3>

<p>It is not as good as the planet series one, as it does not have a 1x1 cone on the tail which in my opinion, looks a&nbsp;lot better. Due to being cheaper because it&#39;s with the magazine without any other pieces and it is not a polybag. If you have the money and want to have a small &#39;army&#39; of these mini starfighters, as this is the second time we&#39;ve seen one.</p>
