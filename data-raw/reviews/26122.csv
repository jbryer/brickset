<p><strong>Presentation</strong></p>

<p>The packaging style for these special Blu-Rays has changed, gone are the boxes with clear windows and visible Minifigure, now it is one completely sealed box with images of the characters and events of the movie on the front and back with a small box indicating the limited edition exclusive figure included in the box. I like this change, as it helps with a better storage and uniform design for these LEGO specials to have boxes that can line up perfectly on the shelf.</p>

<p>There is only one extra advertised on the back on top of the special that is included, which I find to be a tad disappointing, WB and LEGO should really try to make more content, or at least include bonus episodes of past animated series so there is more to watch than just the hour and ten minutes special.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Since the new style of packaging takes the Minifigure and turns it into a separate polybag, we shall be discussing the print and everything there. What I will do from now on is mention who is included and if they are suitable based on the film in question.</p>

<p>This film includes the bonus character of Cosmic Boy, a character who plays a vital role to the progression of the story, it&rsquo;s nice to see him here compared to Lightning Lad who was limited to a Target exclusive cube set which is very difficult to come by on the secondary market. Hopefully in the future LEGO will give us Saturn Girl as a bonus in another special or an actual set as being exclusive would be extremely frustrating.</p>

<p><strong>Contents</strong></p>

<p>78 Minutes of LEGO DC fun is what you&rsquo;ll enjoy with this special. The animation and story are very impressive, especially in High Definition as you can really see the details of the plastic being animated from LEGO sets. Speaking of sets this one has very few featured, the Javeline appears once again, as does the odd Batplane and Bat-Mech from the Justice League sets, they are in the classic blue and grey Bat colour scheme instead of what you actually find in the sets.</p>

<p>The Batmobile from The Riddler Chase is modified into a time machine during the course of the special into a time traveling variant with The Flash being used as a power source. Many Minifigures appear, including Hal Jordan Green Lantern, The Flash, Wonder Woman, Superman, Brainiac, Martian Manhunter (in a brief cameo) and of course Batman. Supergirl makes her brand new debut alongside members of the Legion of Super Heroes.</p>

<p>The special is very entertaining, the extra material is a bit of flubbed lines combined with a breakdown of animation showing storyboards in very brief snippets and animatics, film enthusiasts might find it a bit entertaining, but it is a far cry from what was chosen to be the bonus material in the other specials and I&rsquo;m afraid younger viewers might not enjoy it as much.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This is a solid presentation, par for the course when it comes to the LEGO DC Super Heroes specials, with a great Minifigure as well. Unfortunately it is a bit lackluster when it comes to the contents compared to past specials, not enough to do concerning it, however it will still entertain the targeted audience and older fans will still enjoy all of the ties to past specials and past continuity from DC Comics. I&rsquo;d recommend tracking this one down and adding it to the collection.</p>
