"CHARIZORDO","2022-03-31T20:06:15.817Z","What time is it? IT'S... ADVENTURE TIME!","<p>Lego 21308 is one of my very favourite sets. When it was released, I was a little young for Adventure Time. But, when I started watching the show, I yearned for this now retired set. I finally convinced my parents to let me get it off of Ebay.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Makes for an amazing setup</p>

<p>Very fun to build (especially while watching the last few episodes of the show)</p>

<p>Generous extra pieces</p>

<p>Good quality box</p>

<p>Printed faces</p>

<p>Good blocky yet realistic features</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Needs more characters (including the best character, LSP)</p>

<p>Grey parts on arms</p>

<p>Legs do not move</p>

<p>Box makes some characters look bigger than they are</p>

<p>They could have made a whole line of these sets...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a set that every major Adventure Time fan needs.</p>
