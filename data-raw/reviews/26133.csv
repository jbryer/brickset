<p>Smooth, unproblematic, but nothing special. A&nbsp;brick separator will be handy&nbsp;when disassembling the model due to&nbsp;some stacked plates and tiles.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are 60 parts, plus&nbsp;6 spare, with a good variety of colours and designs: hinge and jumper plates, sloped and SNOT parts, cross plates, not to mention the&nbsp;spider.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t play with models so can&#39;t really judge this, but it feels more of a display than a play model. There is some poseability:&nbsp;the legs can be moved horizontally, the arms&nbsp;vertically, and the spider and the eyes&nbsp;can be rotated, but the tongue is fixed.</p>

<p><strong>Value for money&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>A free set&nbsp;is by definition excellent value for money. As I write this, the average price on Bricklink for the past 6 months has been&nbsp;&pound;4.43, which is slightly less good value than&nbsp;a small&nbsp;boxed 3-in-1&nbsp;creator set.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>The blue parts jar a bit with the green ones for my taste, but fortunately most blue parts are in the back, thus&nbsp;not visible in the photo.&nbsp;Like most MMMBs, the back&nbsp;is quite &#39;blocky&#39; and uninteresting. To sum up, it&#39;s a model to be seen from the front.</p>

<p>Other than those two minor quibbles, I feel this is what&nbsp;MMMBs should be: a quirky, fun, easy to build, poseable display&nbsp;model&nbsp;with&nbsp;a good variety of parts.</p>
