"Castlefan10","2016-05-15T20:24:21.62Z","An Excellent Army Builder","<p>Stopped by the Lego store today and was surprised to see that the Nexo Knights battle packs were already out. Needless to say, I purchased both.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is your typical store exclusive packaging, with the figures encased in a plastic shell. The &quot;instructions&quot; are simply a folded pamphlet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of good parts here, including new torso and leg prints. A wide variety of weapons are also included, from&nbsp;medieval bows and flails to a long pole-type object and a jagged sword exclusive to the NK line.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set consists of four generic lava monsters who seem to be combinations of Ash Attackers, Crust Smashers, and Flame Throwers. Unfortunately their parts cannot be re-arranged to make four &quot;official&quot; monsters, but the new armor prints make up for that. This set also holds the distinction of having the most Lava Monsters of any NK set, as even the largest set in the line, Jestro&#39;s Volcano Lair, also contains four.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set is a must have for any Nexo Knights fan simply because Lava Monsters are hard to come by in large numbers and this set is one of the exceptions. Four figures for fifteens bucks is always a good deal, but five would have been better, especially since battle packs like these used to have the extra figure.</p>

Even if you aren&rsquo;t a fan of Nexo Knights these Minifigure designs make for an excellent Castle themed enemy in keeping with the Ogres/Trolls and Skeleton Warriors of the Fantasy Era.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The packaging is similar to action figures. It&rsquo;s a blister-bubbled card with the four Minifigures predominantly displayed. The card back has a very nice artwork element showing the world of Nexo Knights behind the figures with an erupting volcano and some technological barriers set up in a grassy and rocky area. Overall a nice looking package design.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Ash Attacker: All of these Minifigures have been discussed before, they share the same prints as their found-in-set counterparts. All of them mix-and-match parts as well to make the figures look unique. This Ash Attacker has an armoured upper torso with bare fur-short covered legs, the spiky shoulder armour and the bulky looking helmet. His designated weapon is a large pike topped by a LEGO Sai piece.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Crust Smasher: There are two Crust Smashers in this set, both of which have different torsos and legs. One is wearing protective chest armour over black stone magma print detailing with furry shorts and shoulder armour piece, this one uses a mace/flail weapon and one of the three-clawed weapon pieces introduced around the time of Prince of Persia.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The second Crust Smasher has a bare-chested torso, ordinary black legs with print detailing and a quiver with arrows and old-style Castle crossbow piece. Both of them make really great foot soldiers for an army.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Flame Thrower: The final Minifigure is another Flame Thrower, again he isn&rsquo;t doing much to throw flames. He uses the armoured torso and legs combination with shoulder armour and LEGO Mohawk piece in black. His weapon of choice is a dangerous serrated blade attached to one of those half-hilt pieces used for nunchucks.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This is a great little addition to the Theme for fans of army building, the cost of 15-17.99$ Canadian at full retail was a bit much to swallow. There are no Nexo Powers included in the set and the Minifigures are all using parts we&rsquo;ve seen before in the actual sets, however it&rsquo;s a strong offering for Nexo Knights as an army builder. Decidedly recommended if you can still find it.</span></span></span></span></p>
