Do I think it&rsquo;s a bad special? Not entirely, however read on and see if this is worth tracking down to add to your collection.</span></span></span></span></p>

The images do a disservice to the buyer as there is no reference to anything that is happening in the Batman side-story of the special except for Bane and Deathstroke and nothing about any of the odd stuff they&rsquo;ve created here.</span></span></span></span></p>

Also included is of course a Minifigure. It looks exciting, looks can be deceiving.</span></span></span></span></p>

He plays a pivotal role in the film and this version has a print that hasn&rsquo;t been seen since around 2007 or so. Please see the review of the individual polybag for a more detailed look at the print and accessories.</span></span></span></span></p>

First of all, the voice cast continues to fluctuate, important characters retain their previous voice actors, unfortunately another actor has taken on the role of the Joker here and his voice just doesn&rsquo;t sound as well as it could be. New characters stand out more though with some great voice work, Bane, Deathstroke, Nightwing, Starfire, Beast Boy, Robin and Batman&rsquo;s mentor Madam Mantis.</span></span></span></span></p>

A batplane with two cockpits for Batman and Robin, the Batdriller, and we finally get to see the Batboat from the recent set featuring Deathstroke. Some of the vehicles may wind up appearing in The LEGO Batman movie and their subsequent sets, it would certainly be a nice cross promotion.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The story that follows Batman as he is taken on &lsquo;vacation&rsquo; is really odd. It starts out alright, but then it involves some weird underground society of characters that sound like they&rsquo;re the DC equivalent of those two Looney Tunes gophers. It&rsquo;s a very odd storyline that most adult fans might leave the special scratching their heads at, there are some good ideas here, mostly, it&rsquo;s just the fact that these strange underworld dwellers are a key component just really detracts from what could have been an otherwise great special. Younger viewers might like it, and the stuff not centred on Batman really looks great, the special even has a new unique intro with recreations of the famous comic covers these characters were first introduced in, in LEGO form.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I have mixed feelings about this special, while it was entertaining for the most part as an AFOL I really didn&rsquo;t understand why they focused so much on Batman and trivialized the Gotham City scenes, the special is called Gotham City Breakout and with that as the title it makes it appear to be focused around that and not some weird Batman adventure involving underground creatures that talk like Looney Tunes characters.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I would recommend this if it ever goes on sale to older fans who might still enjoy it, I don&rsquo;t regret the purchase and the kids will enjoy it, though some might get annoyed with the new Joker&rsquo;s odd fascination with his spoon, it&rsquo;s a good idea for a one-off gag, but constantly having him refer to the spoon as a character is just a bit lackluster. The fact that there is nothing else besides the special here to even watch is a real turn-off, why not include a few episodes of The Batman or Brave and the Bold? Give more to watch. Overall mildly recommended, your mileage may vary.</span></span></span></span></p>
