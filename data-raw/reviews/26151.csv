Therefore it is a minimalistic&nbsp;model&nbsp;with few pieces that includes a solitary figure to draw you in, the norm for magazine gifts. But does it hold its own as a small model?&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Includes cute Miku&nbsp;the dragon figure.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Parts are<strong>&nbsp;</strong>pretty<strong>&nbsp;</strong>common,&nbsp;with the exception of Miku&nbsp;the dragon figure &amp; maybe the medium purple branch.</li>
	<li>The model feels a little pathetic when truly examined,&nbsp;though part count limitations make this somewhat understandable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this set<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is lacking in substance, though I still find it rather charming. But I wouldn&#39;t recommend it to TFOLs or AFOLs, unless you desperately want a Miku&nbsp;figure. Though if you are buying it solely for the model it will feel quite overpriced.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, for little kids who are interested in LEGO Elves, or fantasy in general, this would make a nice gift. And I&#39;d say it would be ideal for children who tend to rebuild their LEGO sets, I&#39;m sure lots of ideas would&nbsp;<em>stem&nbsp;</em>from the medium purple <em>branch </em>;)</p>
