This book was released some point late 2016 for a price of &pound;16.99. Let&rsquo;s take a look at the 255 pages of awesomeness.</p>

<p><strong>Timer and Activity Selector&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The timer and activity selector is what drew me into asking for this book for Christmas 2016, the red plastic electronic has 4 rubber buttons on the front; the largest is a white button with a question mark that chooses one of the 365 build for you to challenge yourself with, the next button is a smaller yellow button with a set timer function of up to 20 minutes that is displayed on the screen, then a blue button is just to reset the timer which the yellow button also does so this button is useless and finally a green button that starts and pauses the timer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A speaker is on the left of the device that makes noises when the timer is over and when a activity is chosen and a small digital clock like display that shows the activity number and the times you can have and the time remaining. Finally there&rsquo;s a DK logo printed on the bottom left. Oh and also it is a battery operated device using just 1 3v coin battery that comes with the book&nbsp;but has a screw held flap when the battery is dead.</p>

<p><strong>Book</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be looking at each sections of the book.</p>

<p><strong>Section 1 Index and some basic building tips.</strong></p>

<p>The first 10 pages just tell what categories are spread throughout the book of those 43 categories include Multi-player Games and Solo Challenges. Then the next 6 pages show tips and knowledge such as technical names for some parts and how i use studs on the sides and technic parts and making sturdy builds and tells you to use a creative mindset.</p>

<p><strong>Section 2 All 365 Builds</strong></p>

<p>From page 18 to 251 there are 365 different builds and ideas for people to challenge themselves with such as Build a Dream Home on page 28 or a Micro Movie Set on page 63 and even a Make up holder on page 117 but my favourite builds are the minifigures&nbsp;scale builds and replica home furnishings.</p>

<p><strong>Section 3 Solutions and Meet the Builders.</strong></p>

<p>Dotted through out the book where 3 games they are a Sudoku on page 54, solve a farmer puzzle on page 78-79 and a spot the difference on page 88. Finally on pages 254 and 255 there are interviews with 8 builders who had their builds featured in the book.</p>
