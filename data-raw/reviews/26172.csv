"tjarrett","2016-07-20T22:00:29.377Z","Great looking model","<p>10252 Volkswagen Beetle is a detailed, fun build with a lot of interesting building techniques that results in a highly playable model. As a bonus, it looks great when displayed&nbsp;alongside <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10220-1/Volkswagen-T1-Camper-Van"">10220 Volkswagen T1 Camper Van</a>. I decided to pick it up on the VIP pre-sale and I&#39;m glad I did.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: &quot;Museo Slab&quot;, Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>Good sized, theoretically resealable box with tab closure. Instructions and sticker sheet are loose in the box (meaning there&#39;s a slight roll in the instruction booklet), as are the four main tires; everything else is packed in numbered bags.</p>

<p>Instructions are clear for the most part, though there is a misleading set of illustrations at steps 49-50 that makes it possible to attach the tail/brake lights too low, leaving a gap between brake light and indicator. I&#39;ve seen at least one review where the builder made this mistake.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Amazing selection of parts in a new (to me) color.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>None.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Fun and easy build. There are some innovative tricks to joining the different subassemblies of the car (which may be a problem; see below). It took about three or four hours of part time building to put it together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is beautiful. There are arguments that could be made about how faithful the model is to the curves of the original; I feel it&#39;s close enough to be easily recognizable. The accessories (especially the beer cooler) are fantastic.</p>

<p>The wheels turn more easily than those of 10220. Too easily. I nudged the model and it rolled off the high shelf it was on and it landed nose first and broke into a bunch of pieces. In fact, the bracket broke off the back of the headlight assembly. Reassembly&nbsp;took another 40 minutes. I highly recommend displaying the model with wheel chocks.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the finished model (minus the broken headlight) next to 10220. The scale is pretty close&mdash;the Beetle is 8 inches shorter than the van in real life so it&#39;s a little off, but they look good when displayed together, don&#39;t they?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A fantastic set. Highly recommended.</p>

"pinz","2018-07-01T23:21:15.69Z","A classic car got a Lego-model","<p>Do you remember the distinct sound the VW-Beetle-engine made? I do! So this model shapes itself quite good after the original beetle.</p>

<p>But it is a newer Version of the Beetle based on the backwindow. I just miss the lamps at the back.</p>

<p>The building it self is segmented in 3 parts, but if you have built ever a Lego-Model, you should be finish within 4 hours. There are some nice ideas in, like the hood (or better the trunk, as the beetle had a rear-engine). There are no overcomplicated&nbsp;steps, so it is a smooth experience and one that makes fun.</p>

<p>The design is quite retro, fitting the car. Also a lot of nice details are in, not so much like in the T1, but quite a few. Like the handbreak, the gearstick, a spare tire and the ice-box with the Surfboard.</p>

<p>The only thing that is a bit annoying is the amount of stickers. That could be reduced by just using one set of numberplates. But hey, it&#39;s a nice gimmick. I said: its the 007 edition, it can change the numberplates.</p>

<p>But be not mistaken, this a model you put on display, not to play. If you look for a play model, choose the little brother.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would like to have seen a bit mote polished instruction, like for the ideas sets, or the Porsche GT or now the Bugatti. Not so much, but a bit background a few pictures&nbsp;of the Beetle past and now, that would have put on the cherry for this set.</p>

<p>One of my daughter&#39;s favourite.</p>

<p>A mini scale model is also available.</p>

"Zeke_Nitron","2018-08-27T03:08:54.74Z","Well made vintage display piece","<p>This set is groovy! Beautiful&nbsp;light blue pieces, good builds, and designs and that classic look make this set a great display piece. This set is also has a good playability factor, as the car has little features that make the model both authentic, and fun to play with. There is also a good cloth piece, an interesting surfboard build and lots of license&nbsp;plate prints&nbsp;Deffinantly worth picking up for a good price.</p>

"Cheeze_ball","2022-07-03T22:07:38.887Z","A good addition to the Creator line","<p>Great Set. By no means is a complex build, but it is fun. I feel the curvature was nicely captured. The proportions look a little off; I feel it should be a touch wider. Still, fun build and on par with the rest of the Creator cars of the same scale. Looks great next to its smaller brother on my shelf.</p>
