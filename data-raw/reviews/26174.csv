<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">At 1277 pieces, this is one of the largest ever City sets, and one of the larger sets of 2016 (so far) - slightly more pieces than Samurai X Cave Chaos (Ninjago) and Jestro&#39;s Volcano Lair (Nexo Knights).</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">The large box contains 11 numbered bags and 2 unnumbered bags containing the larger pieces, 6 separate instruction manuals, and a moderate sticker sheet.</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">This set uses the Bright Yellowish Green and Dark Stone Grey colour scheme of the Volcano Explorers theme, which I personally like.</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">First up, is the lifter vehicle. A small and simple build, with a neat lifter mechanism which easily slides around a lava boulder and can rotate as it lifts to keep the rock in place. This vehicle comes with 2 mini figures, an adventurer/driver and a volcano worker, and a crate with some tools.</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">The lava boulder is new for this theme, consisting of 2 identical transparent bright orange side shells with an inside stud (holding a transparent blue crystal in one). The 2 sides slot together, and have a small hole in the top. (Used by the cracker mechanisms - see below) </font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">Second up is the small dumper truck. Another simple and solid build, with a partly open cage in the back to carry a lava boulder. This easily tips sideways to empty out any cargo. Lifting the cab roof does not really give enough access to put the driver into the seat - you really need to remove the windscreen too. This vehicle includes a female volcano explorer.</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">Next we have the first of the mobile units which can be moved by the helicopter. This one is the boulder cracker. A sliding mechanism (sprung with rubber bands), moves the twin pointed bars down into the hole in the top of the lava boulders (see above), splitting them open. - This action is a little bit hit-and-miss. Sometimes it opens them fully (separating the 2 halves) and sometimes it just partly separates them, so they need pulling apart by the guys with the pick axes. This may well be down to how tightly the 2 halves of the rock slit together. The mobile cracker includes a female volcano worker.</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">Fourth up is the mobile lab, the second mobile unit; (which does not have rolling wheels as the website description says); but does have a workbench with a microscope and a coffee mug, a seismograph on the back wall, and a single bed with an overhead reading lamp. Round the back is a storage area with clips for a shovel, a camera and a walkie-talkie. There are also a female scientist and a volcano adventurer with the lab.</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">Next we come to the main build - the Helicopter, which uses 4 of the bags as well as a few large pieces. This is built in 4 stages - first the rear transport hold section, and second the front lower portion of the cockpit. Both of these use corner technic beams (and a lot of friction pegs) to build the structures which connect these sections to the central upper spine section. This upper spine section is built next - with a technic beam frame joining the front and rear sections, mounting the simple (but effective) locking mechanism to hold the mobile units in place while they are being transported, covered with the large yellowish green curved roof elements, and reinforced with dark grey plates and bricks along the top. This forms a good solid and stable frame for the whole helicopter.</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">Lastly, we finish the upper grey spine; add the twin sets of rotor blades, the removable front cockpit windscreen roof section, and the rear closing door. The instructions tell you to add the 4 wheels before the rest of this final stage, which includes several more plates and bricks along the top spine, something which requires downward pressure on the rest of the model - something I found best done without the wheels to give a more stable and solid base for this. The helicopter also includes a pilot mini figure.</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">The helicopter uses several internal pieces in a variety of colours (red, blue and yellow), some of which are visible looking around the outside of the model, particularly looking up from below or into the rear section. This doesn&#39;t overly bother me, but some might find themselves hunting out those pieces in other colours which better match the rest of the vehicle.</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">Last up is the Volcano, which uses several preformed pieces (aka BURPs), as well as standard bricks and slopes, in dark stone grey as well as transparent red and orange for the lava flows. (Step 1 of the volcano itself starts with a standard Brick 2X4 in Dark Stone Grey!) </font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">The volcano contains 2x Lava Rocks, and a little blue crystal topped lever knocks the front section off the volcano - allowing it to &#39;erupt&#39; spewing the lava rocks out. There is also a scientist in a heavy duty heat suit, exploring on the volcano itself.</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">The helicopter slots over the mobile units easily, and the locking mechanism is effective in holding them in place while the helicopter flies around, meaning it can be swooshed without too much risk of the units falling out. </font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">Most of the build is very simple, but, as an AFOL who remembers instructions where each step added dozens of parts without a parts list, often requiring a &#39;spot the difference&#39; exercise between the step pictures - the modern instructions make it&nbsp;way too easy. It was still a fun build for all of the models, but the helicopter itself was the most satisfying part of the build.</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 0pt;""><font color=""#000000"" face=""Calibri"">Overall this is a great set, and well worth the price tag. The large helicopter, two smaller vehicles, two &#39;mobile&#39; units which can be carried by the helicopter, 8 mini figures, and an erupting volcano offer a large variety of play features. The 1277 pieces include very few tiny pieces (no double set of stud shooter ammo here, which can account for 12 to 24 pieces in one of the larger sets from an action theme!), and offers a good selection of parts for MOCs, including plenty of dark stone grey bricks, plates and slopes (as well as the BURPs). </font></p>

"Sobel","2017-10-03T14:03:53.153Z","Impressive Helicopter, very good set with little flaws in detail","<p>Continuing my collecting spree of LEGO helicopters, this large guy had to be added to my collection. Unfortunately, it was to be only available at the LEGO online shop for almost 130&euro;, which is pretty much in my opinion.<br />
That being mentioned, onward, wot glory!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Huge box, but, as always, sturdy and solid, no ditches or else. Every part of the set is shown on the backside, so no big surprises await.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A nice blend of all kind of parts: TECHNIC parts for the internal structure of the helicopter, base plates for the &quot;mobile units&quot;, a lot of gear for the minifigs, transparent coloured stones for the lava, four pieces of pyroclastic material and big, bulky wheels for the two trucks. Nothing too special at all, but could also be used well for building your own ideas! And, like with most recent sets, you get a lot of stickers to fiddle with.</p>

<h3><br />
Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with eight minifigures, which is a good amount. You get five male and three female explorers, with one of these seeming to be the lead scientist of the crew. Combined with the gear you get, all those minifigs give the set a great playability.</p>

<h3><br />
The build</h3>

<p>This time, I poured all the parts together in one big box, like I did back in the days. So the overall build took me a while longer, but hey, for the fun!! I&#39;ll divide this part and following, so every paragraph covers one part of the set.<br />
<em>The trucks:</em><br />
Easy build, no surprises.<br />
<em>The &quot;mobile units/modules&quot;:</em><br />
Both these units are build quite similarly, with the one focusing on the double-pyroclast-breaker and the other on small details of a research lab. The &quot;breaker&quot; works with two rubber bands to retract it. Also here, nothing too difficult.<br />
<em>The helicopter:</em><br />
Like I wrote earlier, the internal structure is made from TECHNIC parts, which makes it VERY robust and sturdy. Some parts might be quite hard to built for a kid, but as I know us AFOLs, we are always willing to help! The rest of the build is also pretty straightforward, connecting the cockpit and the cargo bay via TECHNIC bars and then building upwards, finishing with the rotor blades, of course.<br />
<em>The volcano:</em><br />
Another easy build, with lots of big parts. Left me a little disappointed here, for there is no real supporting structure in it, it is completely hollow and the backside is left all open, looking really odd. Also, when you apply some pressure during the build, the whole thing tends to break because of lacking fixations.</p>

<h3><br />
The completed model</h3>

<p><em>The trucks:</em><br />
Two bulky off-road trucks, made for heavy work. Exactly what I expected.<br />
<em>The &quot;mobile units/modules&quot;:</em><br />
Full of details and functions, these two units make up the core part of this set to me, evening with the helicopter itself. The double-&quot;drill&quot; works seamlessly, cracking open two of them orange rocks at a time, so you can get your hands on those freaky blue crystals (Only thing is, how long will the rubber bands last, when played heavily?). The mobile lab has a microscope-thingy, a bed with a lamp (nice!), a big screen and a room for gear. The gratings which serve as protection in-flight also serve as stairs to enter the elevated lab.<br />
<em>The helicopter:</em><br />
It is pretty large, with of course the attached module making most of the size. In the back, there is a large hatch leading to a cargo room which has a good size to fit the toolbox or other stuff. The lock-part, where the modules are attached is an interesting construction, which at first seemed to my quite unstable, but when a module is attached, everything holds together perfectly (even though the module dangles a little bit, but oh, well...). The cockpit is OK, with room for two, even though there is only one pilot. I don&#39;t like how it is finished, though, leaving some open gaps, which could&#39;ve easily been closed with some additional parts. The rotors are powered by some massive engines, which give the model also an impressive height for a helicopter.<br />
<em>The volcano:</em><br />
I like the display of the lava and the &quot;eruption-function&quot;, which releases two of those pyroclast-things. But the volcano is only nice to look at from the direct front. With a little more effort, this thing could have become quite impressive, but this way it looks kinda... odd and unfinished.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A large set with good playability and minor flaws. Definitely not a must-have, but a very good addition too every LEGO helicopter collection. Even though there are many parts, figures and functions, I still think the price of nearly 130&euro; is too high. Comparing it to licensed sets like the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75189-1/First-Order-Heavy-Assault-Walker"">new AT-AT</a> or the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21309-1/NASA-Apollo-Saturn-V"">Saturn V rocket</a>, it comes out quite expensive. But that&#39;s just my humble opinion.</p>
