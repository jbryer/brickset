"J14T14","2018-03-09T16:58:56.763Z","Semi-Exclusive Minifigure is Semi-Super","<p>This LEGO&reg; Dimensions Super Girl&nbsp;set came only in the PS4 starter pack for the game. It is just a semi-exclusive minifigure with an exclusive dimensions toy tag. I got this from a third party and I was a little underwhelmed by it.</p>

<p>To start off, the only thing exclusive about this minifigure&nbsp;is the hairpiece. I think that it looks better than the hair piece used in the Brainiac&nbsp;Attack set, but it doesn&#39;t help the fact that the figure still isn&#39;t all that exclusive. It would have been nice to get some exclusive prints or even the newer style of cape, but LEGO didn&#39;t do either.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have the game, so I only buy the dimensions sets for the figures, and this one was disappointing. If you have the game, then you should get this for the in game value, but don&#39;t get it otherwise.</p>

<p>She&#39;s the only figure with the Lantern Transform Ability and as such needed to 100% complete the came. Bit of a shame in light of the above.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all a great addition to the game.</p>

"Orangekoi","2018-03-10T18:44:42.54Z","Best Character in LEGO Dimensions dispite limited release","<p>Being one of the two exclusive LEGO Dimensions playable characters from Year 2 (the other being Green Arrow), Supergirl&nbsp;becomes all the more desirable to get your hands on and add to the collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Game there are a ton of things that make Supergirl&nbsp;stand out from the crowd. Her abilities include: flying, dive, laser, Red Lantern, super strength, and&nbsp;indestructibility. I found Supergirl&nbsp;to be very useful in land races as well as flying races, as she could move quicker than most fully modified land vehicles as well as have an easier time avoiding obstacles in the way. In a pinch, Supergirl&nbsp;could be used to beat under water races if you don&#39;t have Aquaman, but it is a good deal more difficult and you need to be good at timing your boosts and maneuvering. All of these are reasons Supergirl&nbsp;is normally my go to character when playing.</p>

<p>One thing that gives her an edge over&nbsp;Superman and Wonder Woman for me&nbsp;is the lack of a soundtrack that is set off every time you fly. This may sound like a nitpick, but trust me, you would be quick to agree with me, after having played with Superman for five minutes and constantly having to hear his classic theme start playing over and over every time you start go to fly. Especially if you are doing something that requires you to have to constantly stop and go flying from objective to objective.</p>

<p>Parts wise, the only exclusive piece is the Character Tag Supergirl&nbsp;is placed on, as we&#39;ve seen her body in the 76040 Brainiac Attack set, her stiffer cape on frequent sets over the years, and her hairpiece in a couple other sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, Supergirl&nbsp;is a great&nbsp;addition to anyones LEGO Dimensions&nbsp;team and collection.</p>
