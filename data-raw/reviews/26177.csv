<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>He comes pre-built.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Excellent parts from the nicely printed torso and slope piece to the beard, cape, and head.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>What more needs to be said. We get Merlok 1.0 and he is awesome! The printing is nice and the old wizard does have a certain air about him when you are actually looking at him in the flesh. I believe his face print is unique too, or at least I&#39;ve not seen one like it, so that makes it all the more fun to get. Shame his beard covers that USB memory stick. But I guess it will help him age better in case we ever replace that technology for something more ubiquitous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His cape is of note as it is the hard type but not as hard as the one you get in Star Wars sets. In fact it is identical to the softer type found in the King&#39;s Mech. Or at least it feels that way. It is a nice touch and I appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing to build he comes premade. But still it is fun.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Just the figure and as mentioned it is great. As for the book itself it reads more like a huge advertisement for the NEXO Knights line. Though there are some interesting bits to behold there. Also it comes with a useful map of the kingdom of Knighton. It also refers to the Merlok Minifigure as Merlok 2.0 which is odd given his coloring. So I just ended up calling him Merlok 1.0.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Definitely a great figure to have. My kids see him as a real LEGO minifig so it is great to have a copy of him finally. He can substitute for the sticker version included in the Fortrex.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only downside to this is that he does not come with his gnarled staff. But that is OK. It is an opportunity to take those spare bits from other Knighton&nbsp;sets and make your own! Now to ponder which one looks best on him.</p>
