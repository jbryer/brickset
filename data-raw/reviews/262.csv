It's a nice solid ""impulse"" that gives you the essence of the Studios line: Moviemaking.<br><br>Building Experience: Not much here. It's a simple impulse set with a fold out instruction sheet.<br><br>Parts: The thing that really sells this set to me is the Director minifig. Cleverly modeled after Steven Spielberg, the director also appears in my favorite LEGO video game, Island Xtreme Stunts. The copter itself has some nice touches of yellow, a top propeller, and a camera for filming the action. The set also comes with a nicely illustrated comic book.<br><br>Playability: Wooosh! This set is a fun thing to swoosh around. Kids will have a lot of fun pretending to make movies. The young at heart will also find the Director minifigure entertaining.<br><br><br>Value for money: I picked this up for less than $3 dollars. Quite a steal considering what today's impulses are.<br><br><br>Final Words: If you want to sample the Studios line or make a ""Behind the Scenes"" MOC, this is a definite set to purchase.<br>",TRUE,4,3,2,4,5

Here&#39;s my review. This set is pretty basic. But considering it was a $3 set in 2001, it&#39;s pretty good. I&#39;d imagine this set would be $5 nowadays so I&#39;m happy I was able to get it for $8. There&#39;s some neat parts in this set including: A camera, helicopter blade, &nbsp;and wheels. This set isn&#39;t the best build experience because your just puttting together a few plates but it&#39;s simple and some people like that. There&#39;s a really cool Steven Spielberg figure that was in a few other studios set. But I think it&#39;s a cool figure. It&#39;s got a useful Vest print and a nice head. We don&#39;t get very many heads for older people nowadays so this is good for any lego city setting. It&#39;s not fun to play with at all. I don&#39;t play with my lego so this isn&#39;t fun for me. But I tried imagining me playing with this when I was the target age, 6 and it still wouldn&#39;t be fun. I think they should&#39;ve added more wheel so it could be a car too and it would&#39;ve made it better.&nbsp;<br />

<p>thanks for reading the review, I&#39;d definitely recommend this set to anyone who loves older lego. Definitely a good cheap pickup, 6/10</p>
