"Danny_B08","2016-07-26T10:13:32.81Z","Lego 76060 Doctor Strange's Sanctum Sanctorum","<p>One of the first things that caught my eye was the sticker sheet. I was slightly disappointed that on the box the window of the Sanctum Sanctorum has a backdrop however that is simply box art. Needless to say that is my only disappointment with this set!&nbsp;</p>

<p>More noticeably on the sticker sheet was the letter from &#39;Stark Industries&#39; which could be a spoiler for the film! Assuming it hints to an end credit scene of some sort?</p>

<p>As for the build, well its fantastic! The attention to detail is sublime and the functions included are pretty neat too! Although there are only 3 main functions I absolutely LOVE the spinning tentacles on the monster, which is controlled by a crank with gears on the back of the set. Another main function are the 2 clear poles in which you can sit (or stand) figures on and move and twist the pole from behind the set to give the illusion of he figures flying/floating.&nbsp;<br />
The last function is a tad confusing seeing as the film hasn&#39;t been released yet and that is the cloak holder to the left hand side of the set, the instructions tell you to place Strange&#39;s cloak on the joint and you can move it around (from behind the set again) as if it is moving on its own.</p>

<p>The build has more of a diorama feel to it rather than a generic lego set and to me it works very well! The bookshelves are brilliant and a stand out build in the set too, not to mention the build for the window!</p>

<p>Another little spoiler perhaps might be the red little gem they include in the set which is kept in the chest towards the left of the building, which might be an infinity gem of some kind, but that is just my pure speculation.</p>

<p>Lastly the figures. These are 3 fantastic figures! All three have double sided torso and head printings and all have leg printing too!&nbsp;<br />
The Ancient One&#39;s torso is gold and her new fan pieces are transparent with gold printing on them and look incredible!<br />
Doctor Strange comes with two of the new grips for 2016 and these two awesome looking radar dish pieces in transparent and printed with gold lettering to give off the illusion he is casting a spell! Also noticeable for Steven Strange is the printed hair piece! Which looks brilliant with the white strands printed onto the black mould!<br />
Lastly Karl Mordo is the &#39;generic&#39; mini figure of the set but that means nothing as he still looks fantastic and comes with the newer afro hair piece for this year.</p>

<p>Overall the set is fantastic! For &pound;29.99 I really can&#39;t complain, the 3 figures are brilliant, the functions are great fun and the set just looks amazing!&nbsp;</p>

"TK_1308","2016-08-04T18:06:39.97Z","""What if I told you the reality you know is one of many.""","<p>Lego releases it&#39;s first set from the upcoming Marvel film Doctor Strange, with Doctor Strange&#39;s Sanctum Sanctorum.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Mid range size rectangular box for a kit in this price range. The price per piece ratio is very good and more generous than other kits in this class.<br />
Doctor Strange is the figure of choice on the top with a battle scene of all 3 figures next to him. The front and back show the playset with the figures battling the monster in the portal and the back has 4 other panels showing the play features.<br />
Oddly enough, this small kit has 2 large rectangular instruction manuals where 1 would&#39;ve been quite sufficient. Unlike other MCU sets, this one does not contain a comic.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A good number of parts in the kit, slightly more than usual for this price point. A nice mix of colours and small components for all the detailing and some great new pieces in the form of mystic spell generated effects.<br />
There are 3 bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains Doctor Strange, the base and lower walls of the sanctum letters, spell books and the two figure &#39;levitation stands&#39;.<br />
Bag 2 contains The Ancient One, the main walls of the sanctum and the portal monster.<br />
Bag 3 contains Karl Mordo, the finishing touches to the walls, the trunk, bookcases, cloak stand, table and all the decorative touches to the set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with 3 minifigures. These are all new releases for the MCU and the level of detailing and colour on all the minifigures is excellent.<br />
Firstly we have Doctor Strange. This is a brilliant figure and a good likeness of the character. The detailing on the hair is a nice touch and the cloak with it&#39;s extended collar is brilliant. He has a two sided head with calm and fighting faces. He comes with two spell cast shields for his hands which are also wonderfully detailed with gold script.<br />
Next up is Karl Mordo, long before he becomes Baron Mordo, one of Strange&#39;s enemies in the comics. A good attempt at capturing the likeness of his on-screen counterpart and he comes armed with a simple black staff weapon. He has a double sided head with calm and fighting faces.<br />
Finally, we have The Ancient One. How close this is to the film version we can&#39;t say. In all the footage she seems to be wearing robes but this figure depicts her wearing what look like purple trousers and strapping over the robe top. It&#39;s still a great figure with a strangely enigmatic face which fits the character so well. She comes armed with 2 clear fans, sporting the same intricate gold text and Strange&#39;s spell cast shields.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 25 minutes.<br />
It&#39;s a very straightforward build with nothing very complicated in the construction.<br />
The designers have taken care to embrace the key things of the Sanctum Sanctorum in the design with the iconic round window, the bookcases of spell books and ancient maps, levers for the figures to sit on to make them appear to be levitating.&nbsp;<br />
The best part of the build is definitely the portal monster. Again, this has not featured in any trailer so it&#39;s either a surprise of the designer referenced the 90&#39;s Spider-Man animated series for ideas. Using technic gears and a simple rotary mechanism, it brings the playset to life with some great features. The maw and design is somewhat reminiscent of the Octopus from Aqua Raiders set 7775.<br />
There are stickers, 8 in total, which are primarily decoration. The largest is the seal on the portal threshold, there are two large book covers and 5 letters. There are some nice references on these for fans.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This kit is a very well put together playset and a nice display piece in itself. For a small set, it certainly has a lot of detailing and features to add to the look and feel of Strange&#39;s Sanctum. Skulls, chests, bottles, chains, letters, maps, spell books - the set is littered with nice little touches like this.<br />
The levitation levers can be controlled from the back and figures can sit floating in the air or they can fly if desired. They can move in and out of the set as well as arcing about 60 degrees vertically<br />
There is one on the left for Strange to hang&nbsp;his mystic cape on as well.<br />
The best feature in the whole set is definitely the portal creature. The bright red tentacles are very poseable with joints mid point on the four larger ones. Using the rotary mechanism on the back, the maw rotates with the 4 large teeth and the tentacles swirl and thrash. If positioned correctly, turning the mechanism allows the tentacles to close and ensnare a minifigure. It has 4 eyes on a disc but these do not rotate with the rest.<br />
The Sanctum measures 29 cm across, 13 cm deep (at the portal end) and 10 cm high.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Like Ant-Man, I suspect that this may be the only release connected with this film. As such, Marvel fans will want to get this set for the characters to round out the growing MCU series of minifigures. This is a great little playset, full of detail, some fun play features and has 3 exclusive (so far) figures so what other reason do you need to buy this great kit.</p>

"Khscarymovie","2016-11-13T04:37:23.73Z","One Of The Best Lego Marvel Sets Ever.","<p>76060 Doctor Strange&#39;s&nbsp;Sanctum Sanctorum is a Lego Marvel set based off the 2016 MCU film Doctor Strange. It offers an incredible build and amazing minifigure&#39;s.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigure&#39;s&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The minifigure&#39;s in this set are Doctor Strange, Karl Mordo, and The Ancient One. Doctor Strange is a fantastic minifigure, very detailed. The only complaint I have about this minifigure is the hair is nor accurate to the movie version of Doctor Strange. Karl Mordo is a perfect minifigure and I can&#39;t think of anything wrong with him. The Ancient One is another great minifigure but is not very accurate to the movie version.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Build</h2>

<p>The build of the set is based off Doctor Strange&#39;s Sanctum Sanctorum, which is basically Doctor Strange&#39;s house. Instead of having a location build that consist of walls blowing up and prisoners being freed, this build is more like the one in the Big Bang Theory set, and I love it for that. The build is very detailed and litters with easter eggs. The monster coming through the portal is a very neat build, and I expect we might get something like this in a future Star Wars set with a rathtar. I think the window is also very nicely done. I love all the treasures and books in the bookcases, I feel kids could create interesting story&#39;s about how Doctor Strange got&nbsp;these items.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>I think the price is incredible for how Many parts you get. I think there are some very interesting parts here, my favorite are probably Doctor Strange&#39;s little dishes that he fight with.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>Overall I think this is one of the best Lego Marvel sets ever. It has an amazing build and fantastic minifigure&#39;s, and it&#39;s for a very cheap price. I would definitely recommend it.</p>

"andyh1984","2016-08-25T19:09:45.973Z","looks better than it plays, but looks great.","<p>A great looking set but lacking playability.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A rectangular box showing the set on the front and the set and features on the back.</p>

<p>For some reason there are 2 instruction booklets where everything would fit into one easily. No mini-comic</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A great use of some standard parts and more unusual parts both&nbsp;in&nbsp;imaginative ways.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>All three Minifigures are superbly detailed, I don&#39;t know my Doctor Strange characters very well so I don&#39;t know the significance of Karl Mordo or the Ancient One or the accuracy of their costume but Doctor Strange&#39;s costume looks very authentic to movie images I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not as long as I had hoped but an involved and interesting build nonetheless, the bookcases, window and portal monster stand out.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>This set looks great with lots of detail some of which is stickers.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I like this set but it is not without some niggles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The &quot;floating cloak&quot; hanger looks out of place when not being used and I suspect that will be most of the time for both adults and children, maybe trans-clear pieces would have been better but some pieces aren&#39;t available in that colour (it is removable if you don&#39;t like it).</p>

<p>It is difficult if not impossible to get the tentacles to &quot;grab&quot; a minifigure to pull towards the portal especially as the area in front of the portal is sloped.</p>

<p>That said this is a good looking model but one which is light on playability for children, maybe because we don&#39;t know what action takes place in this room.</p>

<p>The price for the set is fair.</p>

<p>The design of the set&nbsp;and the&nbsp;minifigures are very accurate to the film.</p>

<p>I think the set needs to be slightly larger and maybe add 1 or 2 more minifigs&nbsp;e.g&nbsp;Kaecilius.</p>

<p>Otherwise this is a great lego set and i highly recommend it. This set is perfect to add to you Marvel cinematic universe collection. :)</p>

This build is pretty simple and straight forward, the only difficult bit would perhaps be the placement of the clear Minifigure control rods, or you know, whatever the official name is for those parts first introduced in LEGO Studios for brick-films. Getting them to fit just right can be a bit frustrating because they aren&rsquo;t meant to connect to anything as they are part of a gimmick.</span></span></span></span></p>

This portion of the build is also fairly simple, however the geared gimmick for the monster can be a bit tricky to get placed just right.

This build is much quicker and very easy to finish off, the bookcases are really fun and similar to other sets who have built such cases. Such as Big Bang Theory or Vampyre Castle. Ultimately I enjoyed the build, it wasn&rsquo;t another silly Marvel vehicle, but an actual playset and as we&rsquo;re about to discuss it looks very fun and involves some clever details and enjoyable play features.</span></span></span></span></p>

More great fun.</span></span></span></span></p>

I&rsquo;m not a fan of having to take the cloak off Doctor Strange though, it&rsquo;s rather frustrating to get on him in the first place until you know how to fold it just right to line up the holes all properly, so having to take it on and off just to make it hover in the corner is a bit annoying. It would have been nicer to get two capes to use, even if it meant that Strange would still be wearing his cloak while one was hovering in the corner of his Sanctum.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s loaded with great details, awesome play features, and brilliant Minifigures. So strongly recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>

For fans of the comics and the movie, this set represents the &quot;Summoning Chamber&quot; on the uppermost floor. That sits right behind the buildings Mystical Seal, the Window.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lego set while being based on the recent movie, does pull a lot from the comics. The color tones, decor and layout more cosely match how it is depicted most often in the comics. The minifigs are pure movie. It&#39;s an interesting set in that it feels like it is targeted to an older age range than most of the other Lego Super Hero sets. It is a nice highly detailed room interior with lots of little things like appointed book shelves and tables. What stickers there are are mainly for mail and papers that add detail. It reminds me a lot of some of the Hobbit or Lord of the Ring sets. Particularly Unexpected Gathering and Mines of Moria. It has quite a few action or play features. But they both feel subtle or subdued, and more than a bit out of place. Please don&#39;t be scared off by what I am saying, this really is a superb set. One of the best Marvel sets of the year. Certainly one of the more distinct ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions -&nbsp;</strong>The Box art is great. The box art is a full frame zoom in so the viewer feels like he is sitting in front of the room that is the build. Framed very much like a TV sitcom. All the action and feelings of movement are staged within the set itself. It is a quite striking effect. There are some faint neutral borders around the edges and a fake NYC scape painting behind the Seal Window. The box shows the three characters Strange, (Baron) Mordo&nbsp;and The Ancient One fighting the tentacled beast from the dark dimension that is coming through the summoning portal. The Back of the box shows a more close up look at the various bits and how each play feature works. Instructions are 2 thick stapled booklets. Curled and stuffed in the box like greasy buritos in a Taco Bag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs -&nbsp;</strong>The set comes with three Minifigs, which is one of the few complaints I have with it. It gives us;</p>

<p>Dr. Strange -&nbsp; with his Cloak of Levitation. Strange is a gorgeous figure who looks exactly as you knew he should. Dark blue with front and back printing and leg printing. His hair piece is the slightly peaked one commonly used for Vampires and J Jonah Jameson, in Black, but with white striping painted on at the temples. It looks good. His torso includes printing of the Eye of Agamoto on a chain around his neck. he also includes two new 3mm grip peg studs and 2 2x2 trans clear dishes printed with golden spells on them. They nicely capture the effect of him casting spells. They do suffer a little as the gold printing on them is a bit fine and doesn&#39;t catch the light as well as you might wish for. You have to look closely to see how really beautiful these things are. The cloak of Levitation is a single piece of fabric, cut so that you fold it four times to get the desired pointed collar and cloak effect. It looks and works as expected. The most interesting element to it is it has its own play feature. Take in off Dr Starange and attach it to the Cloak Hook on the left side of the room. And you can have it float around and help as a disembodied cloak. It&#39;s an awkward but cute play feature. Although It might be worth Bricklinking an extra cloak to leave permanently attached there. The folding at the neck is complex and the neck peg goes through four layers of cloth. Taking it on and off both the figure and the stand repeatedly will cause it to fray.</p>

<p>The Ancient One - She is a gorgeous figure, I&#39;m just not quite sure how well they captures the movie Ancient One. Her torso is dual sided gold printing over a pearl gold base. her legs are purple with gold printing. Her head is... odd. In the movie she is completely bald. Her figures head has her neutral slightly smiling face, but the back of her head has this strange pink cross hatching. Wrinkles? Razor Marks? Some design element from concept art that didn&#39;t make it into the movie? Who knows. The best thing about her figure is her two gorgeous fans. Like Strange&#39;s spells these are trans clear with a ton of fine gold printing. It really gives them a glowing golden ethereal feel. Perfect for the character.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mordo - The final figure is (Baron) Karl Mordo. Strange&#39;s fellow student of the Ancient One. He is the most basic of the three. His main color scheme is dark green with front and back printed robes on his torso and legs. His weapon is a stick. Just a normal Lego 3mm shaft to represent the &#39;Staff of the Living Tribunal&quot;. Rather boring. He has a dual sided face. Each nicely captures his slightly stubly&nbsp;beard and his expressions. He uses the same short curly slightly Afro&#39;d hair piece that we first saw with&nbsp;the Falcon. he looks good. If you want to jazz him up to look more like his fellows, Get a section of Lego Chain in a trans color. Trans Neon Green or Trans Orange, to show his staff in its Whip mode.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest negative of the set is it only has three figs. Since we only got the one Dr. Strange set it really cries out for one or two more figs. We need Wong and maybe a Cultist.</p>

<p><strong>Parts -&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The parts selection is excellent. The delicate printing on Stranges Spells and the Ancient Ones fans are unique to the set and are outstanding. Lots of uses for each. The remainder of the set offers a nice assortment of parts useful for building rooms and interiors. You could nicely decorate a Modular Building&#39;s rooms with what comes in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build and Model -</strong>&nbsp;The build is quite straightforward. You work your way through the baseplate and bottom of the back wall. Add the action features and finish the Mystic Seal and Tentacled Horror, Then fill in the walls. The third bag adds the furnishings. Each bookshelf and table is a nice micro build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The finished model looks great. A nice little backdrop that you can display your figures in front of. Its (limited) play features are the knob that spins the tentacles making them wave and swirl and grab minifigs in a surge of Lovecraftian Horror. There are two character levetation arms, one on either side of the Mystic Seal. They are... well lets be honest they are as useless as they are in every other set that Lego has tried them in, going back to the horrid Star Wars Dual of the Fates set. But at least here they are small, unobtrusive and they can tuck away. The final action feature is the slightly different lift arm for the Cloak of Levitation. As I said above it&#39;s cute. But it looks odd without the cloak on it. If you will be displaying this set, I suggest Bricklinking a second cloak, just to leave one permanently on the play arm. There are lots of maps, pictures and printed and stickered documents reflecting Strange&#39;s research.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall -&nbsp;</strong>This is a stunning small set. It is a room portion done right. Rather like the Big Bang Theory set or the Hobbit or LotR sets named above. It sets the scene perfectly and lets you play out something, if not quite from the movie (The tentacle beast from hell is actually in Guardians of the Galaxy 2, Not Dr. Strange) it certainly has the sort of look and feel to perfectly match a classic scene as drawn by Steve Ditko. So the set manages to bridge the best of both worlds. I would categorize this one as a must have for Marvel Collectors. While we may see another Dr. Strange fig in Thor or Avengers sets (He&#39;s confirmed for Thor Ragnarok and Avengers Infinity War) We will not soon get another Ancient One or Baron Mordo figure. This is a set you as an AFOL can leave out on your bookshelf and friends wont question why you have toys on the shelf at your age.</p>

<p>One word of caution. The set does seem to be targeted a little older. I know the box says 7-14, and the build isn&#39;t that complex. But the actual set may not be as engaging for the younger end of the age spectrum. The older 9-14 kids or beyond will love it. And it is pure crack fro AFOL&#39;s.&nbsp;</p>
