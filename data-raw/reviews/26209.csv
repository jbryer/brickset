"Speed_champions_fan","2017-04-08T14:21:00.647Z","Surprisingly good","<p>I got this set along with the sports car in a promotion at Smyth&#39;s for free. I must admit that when I first saw images of this set I was rather disappointed. It just seemed to be a rejected &pound;5/&euro;6/$7 set. However, having actually built it, it turns out to be quite good.</p>

<p>There is one minifigure, as is common in modern polybags. The figure is very generic and appears in a few other volcano sets. His face has a ginger goatee and some burn marks, which makes sense considering where he works. The torso is superbly detailed front and rear, with a belt, a safety harness, and an orange top underneath. There is some skin visible at the top; that could be dangerous where he works! The legs are printed with some pockets and could be useful elsewhere. Lastly? he has some fire breathing apparatus and a white hard hat.</p>

<p>The build is, as can be expected of a city polybag, short and simple, however the arm is constructed in an interesting way. There are some nice parts, like the turntable, the bulldozer bit, and the harpoon, which you get two of. The finished model looks surprisingly good. The proportions are quite good, and the yellow arm mimics warning labels. The biggest issue is that it is hard to push along. As all the gripping points are above the turntable, it tends to want to wander, and getting it to go straight is a bit of a nightmare.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>Useful figure</p>

<p>Harpoon!</p>

<p>Great display piece</p>

<p>Fits into a scene perfectly</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>hard to push</p>

<p>All in this is a great polybag. I would say that if you get a chance to get this set, grab it. You won&#39;t regret that decision.</p>
