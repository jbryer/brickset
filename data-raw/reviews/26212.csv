<p>This AAT is very good and we&#39;ll built and accurate for its size and price .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The wide base is well built and the spine is sloped vet well and has two cannons on the sides and the engine detail on each side is also good . The head is well built and has the hatch detail and the main cannon unlike the 2020 version is the appropriate length .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is an incredible build with the techniques and accuracy being really good I would recommend it to any Lego star wars fan .</p>
