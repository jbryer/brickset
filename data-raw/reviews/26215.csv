I believe the $100 price point was justified because of the tracks being worth $25 or so. The box was very nice looking and I even think I may display it. The instructions were a little easier than I thought they would be for a 12+ set. The build was very fun though, it took me about 2.5 hours. I was uncomfortable about the piece count but I think the tracks will be useful later. The complete model was simply beautiful and I guess im happy it isn&#39;t to big because my track layout is limited. I am so glad I bought this set and I believe it a very good step into &quot;resurrecting&quot; the classic beloved winter village sets.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Well this is my review of the this year&nbsp;seasonal Winter Village set 10254 Winter Holiday Train.So you get normal big box witch has a nice picture on the front with the train and the christmas atmosphere.On the back of&nbsp;the&nbsp;box you get little pictures with all the functions of the set.REMINDER: You don&#39;t get a power functions, I repeat you don&#39;t get a power functions. :( But I will cover that later.Let&#39;s talk about parts.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>So you get a a bunch of black,green and red pcs.Well that&#39;s nice.You do not get any new pcs.But you will find a problem with the two big wheels on the locomotive.The wheels will slip,&nbsp;so if you have two LEGO color bands just put them on the wheels and the problem is solved.Let&#39;s go to the minifigs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>So you get five minifigs in the set:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Train driver,conducter,grandma,boy and a girl.</p>

<p>Train driver is a normal minifig just with red scarf and blue&nbsp;hat.Conducter is nice with a some kind of a bag and nice torsoue and a hat.Grandma is pretty nice minifig because of the face and hair.I just do not understand a tie on the torsoue,but hey it is LEGO.Boy is nice and he has a jacket from 2015 LEGO City Deep Sea subtheme and girl has nice jacket too.We will now move to the build.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is not hard it is easy for me but you get some several bags so let&#39;s start with the build :)&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Chooo Chooo.Ok the build is done and let&#39;s start with the locomotive.The locomotive is nice and little.I like the details and you have space for minifig and power functions cabels.Tender is nice little build with some pcs as coal and some nice decorations.You can fit the battery box perfect.The connection system between the locomotive and tender is really bad.There is one flatbed with space for gifts,but you cant fit all the presents there.And you get the nice little christmas tree with the mini train under it.There is one special function in this set.When the car is moving the tree is spinning.It has a worm gear under it.There is also the little nice caboose with perfect decorations outside.Inside you have get the two seats and one table with the mug.Mmmmmm the nice worm chocolate will be perfect right now.At the end you get the little platform with one step,light and a bench.You will also get some toys,spare pcs,brick seperator and train tracks to form a nice circle that can fit under the small christmas&nbsp;tree.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Well that is it for this review of the Winter Holiday Train.I hope you liked it and I realy like this set.It is bad that we don&#39;t get the Power Functions and a bigger platform.But hey I hope that LEGO will build the Winter Village Train Station somedays.Well that is it stay tooned for another review tomorrow. :)</p>

"PeteM","2017-03-19T12:16:40.243Z","Above Average Things Come In Small Packages","<p>A train set outside of the City theme is always a welcome surprise, though despite the Creator Expert branding, this is very much a train within the Winter Village theme and definitely not a continuation of the (much missed) Creator Expert train line &ndash; as such, expectations should be adjusted accordingly.</p>

<h3>Box and Instructions</h3>

<p>The box art positions the set very clearly in the Winter Village world, while the back shows off the various features as well as advertising the possibilities of upgrading with Power Functions components. The instructions are as straightforward as you would expect, with no obvious colour confusion that I spotted. They are split into two volumes, the first covering everything that isn&rsquo;t a train, and the second encompassing everything that is.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>In line with the winter theme the colour palette consists of every shade related to Christmas . . . and dark blue. There&#39;s the usual array of train pieces like wheel sets, magnetic couplings, and a large cow catcher for the front of the locomotive, but due to the wheel arrangement there is only one &lsquo;set&rsquo; of the large train wheels, consisting of two flanged and a &lsquo;blind&rsquo; (which is unused). These are in red for only the second time, though at least it was only a six year wait - the red bogie plate is also appearing for the second time, but there has been a 36 year interval since its one and only previous appearance in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7750-1/Steam-Engine-with-Tender"">7750</a> (albeit with a different pin length).</p>

<p>The only truly unique bricks are the two 4-stud &lsquo;brick with bow&rsquo; in bright green. The set also includes a good helping of the small tree leaves in white previously limited to adding snowy foliage goodness to Arendelle, as well as a decent quantity of dark tan 1x2x3 window frames which have only otherwise appeared in the comparatively pricey 10253 &lsquo;Big Ben&rsquo; to date. Six 2x4 bricks with bow also get an honourary mention for appearing in the lovely Earth Blue colour.</p>

<p>Apart from these there aren&#39;t a large number of notably rare pieces, though it&rsquo;s a good source of bricks of the curved &lsquo;bow&rsquo; variety for those want to add a bit of studless curviness to their Lego inventory. Finally, 16 pieces of curved track are included &ndash; enough to make one complete loop of track, perfect for around the Christmas tree&hellip;</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>There are five minifigs included in the set and all are well designed. The Grandma figure features a torso printing previously utilised for the Penguin minifig in a 2014 Batman set &ndash; though the warm looking printed fur lined jacket makes sense, the shirt and tie underneath don&rsquo;t quite fit. This is easily ignored however, and the choice of her second face as &lsquo;snoozing&rsquo; is excellent. The two children have the usual unprinted short legs, and their torso prints have appeared numerous times, but both fit into the set seamlessly.</p>

<p>The two other adults are the train staff &ndash; the conductor has a gruff-looking bewhiskered face, dressed in matching dark red flat cap and trousers and an appropriately smart grey waistcoat. He also has a dark tan shoulder bag for tickets or rum or whatever it is that train conductors need to carry around. The driver is in blue overalls and hat as well as a red neckerchief which should be standard issue for all train drivers following it&rsquo;s use in numerous train sets over the years. Needless to say the printing and designs on all five are as excellent and detailed as we&rsquo;ve come to expect.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build starts slowly with the first bag offering an array of mini-build toys and presents. By their nature some of these are quite fiddly, but all of the toys are excellent &ndash; a (quite clearly Blacktron) spaceship, fire engine and remote control robot are especially brilliant. It also includes the tiny platform which, apart from an interesting new way to build a lamppost, is otherwise unexceptional.</p>

<p>Bags labeled &lsquo;2&rsquo; contain the parts for the train engine and tender, as well as the train driver. There&rsquo;s nothing immediately special or unusual about the way that it all goes together, but it does in fact cleverly conceal a major surprise for later&hellip;. The inverted cone build on the funnel is simple but effective, and the front lamp is connected via a method that I would never even have thought was legal but I&rsquo;m assuming must be &ndash; using the clip on a 1x1 plate with clip to slot into the receiving piece on 2x2 brick with a friction fork. This remains a bit of a fragile connection, but is clever and gets the job done!</p>

<p>The bags labeled &lsquo;3&rsquo; build the remaining two wagons, consisting of a small flatbed with rotating Christmas tree, and a small caboose style coach. The revolving mechanism in the former require a curious Technic assembly to start off, which is then enclosed by the plates which make up the deck of the wagon. The method of constructing the tree is new to me, with small green wedge plates, greebled with smaller green pieces and mounted vertically around a truck via a couple of &lsquo;Dalek&rsquo; bricks. Quite basic, but effective for the scale required. It ends up slaved to the revolution of one of the wheel sets via a worm gear on the wheel axle and a cog which attaches through the deck of the wagon to the tree itself. The caboose is unremarkable in technique and quick to construct.</p>

<h3>Adding Power Functions</h3>

<p>Out of the box, the train is powered by the &lsquo;hand of God&rsquo; and provides plenty of fun for younger children in this vanilla set up, even if it is a little fragile for a more heavy handed child. However, unlike the last non-City train (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/79111-1/Constitution-Train-Chase"">#79111</a>), this model is designed to accommodate Power Functions components (listed <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/list-10993"">here</a> for the interested) and their installation is fairly straightforward thanks to the extra steps included as an addendum to the instructions. This is where the cleverness of the construction suddenly becomes clear and some oddities in the design, like the hole in the train cab floor, suddenly make sense. Without me realising it, the engine had actually been designed to easily break into modules which makes the addition of the power function components relatively simple. It also makes sense of the odd choice of a more secure coupling between engine and tender as this avoids the risk of a magnetic coupling separating and causing the electrical wire between battery and motor to be put under strain.</p>

<p>When motorised the fact that the engine is being dragged from the lightly loaded front bogie causes a couple of issues &ndash; firstly, both the large &lsquo;driving&rsquo; wheels can stick and slip, rather than rotate smoothly with the speed of the train. This can be rectified with the addition of a Lego &lsquo;O&rsquo; ring on the wheels, but it&#39;s a bit of an irritation. Secondly, the motor itself lacks traction due to the fact that there is very little weight above it and it can spin out if subject to abrupt changes in speed (not helped by the increased friction provided by the revolving tree mechanism).</p>

<h3>Completed Model &amp; Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>The result is a charming, if small and cartoony train &ndash; it&rsquo;s not too much of a stretch to see this as the Lego representation of those novelty &lsquo;trains&rsquo; you see hauling disinterested children and fed up parents around shopping malls and other entertainment places around Christmas time. The disappointing lack of driving rods does nothing to dispel this, but is nothing that minor modifications can&rsquo;t improve. There&rsquo;s no getting around that fact that everything in the set is small, from the engine to the wagons and the platform. The caboose only just fits two people inside and the truncated flatbed does not have room for all the presents and toys included in the set. It&rsquo;s certainly not bad for the price point offered (considering the track pieces necessarily included), but could really do with more wagons even if that would mean a high RRP. It&#39;s a shame that the integration of the PF elements (especially the grey IR sensor) isn&#39;t as elegant as it might be, but I&#39;m grateful that at least the option is there and it is good as it could be considering the scale and size that the designer was working with.</p>

<p>Despite these minor quibbles, this is a good little set which has really grown on me since it was revealed, and even more so since I built it. The deliberate cartoon sensibility of the model works well, even as it labours the point that this is a model of a caricature of a &lsquo;proper&rsquo; locomotive. The revolving Christmas tree is a fun feature &ndash; relatively simple to build but effective, and that it features a tiny train around the base of a tree is understatedly self-referential. I especially like the red banding at the base of the funnel and smoke stack as I&rsquo;m choosing to see it as a tiny throwback to the 12v sets of my childhood &ndash; intentional or not! The mini-builds that make up the presents are excellent in their own right and, even though the platform is a bit of a waste of pieces for the average AFOL, it does provide a bit of extra play value as well as encouraging the unsatisfied into making creative improvements.</p>

<p>This is very much a set that has to be assessed on it&rsquo;s own merits as it doesn&rsquo;t fulfil the usual criteria of a City or Creator Expert train set, which may frustrate train fans longing for a full-on steam train to run around a layout. Though arguably undersized and definitely cartoonish, it embraces both of these and succeeds, going for a seasonal cuteness that really does work. It looks fantastic running around a tree or threading it&rsquo;s way through a Winter Village setup and is the seasonal train set that has been sadly missing for years. Now, if only we could get a proper sized station to accompany it &ndash; maybe 2017&hellip;.?</p>

"AndyKbx","2016-12-24T03:40:40.85Z","Must have for Christmas Lego collector","<p>When I first saw this on Lego.com just had to have it as it looked very cute with lots of detail although my first criticism would be the need for at least two perhaps four pieces of straight track to make a small oval rather than just a circle, not a biggy if you have lots of track though which I do.</p>

<p>Built over several days, which I like to do to fully absorb the clever building ideas of which there are a few, very enjoyable build, not hugely complex but complicated enough for all ranges so this would be enjoyed equally well by an adult as younger builder I think.</p>

<p>The best bit is the way it was designed to enable it to be motorized with power functions, easy to fit motor, IR receiver and battery box with only limited disassembly required although I&#39;m going to add parts from a second set to enlarge train to better conceal the IR receiver and battery box which are quite prominent in what is a fairly small engine and tender. Loved the spinning Christmas tree and micro train underneath which was nice touch, a great addition to my Christmas collection.</p>

<p>Overall well designed, very attractive and pretty good value for money.</p>

"HarleyMeenen","2017-01-08T03:30:43.473Z","Wonderful Holiday Set","<p>I love this set, but the best endorsement I can give for it is that my mother let me set it up prominently&nbsp;in her house without complaint throughout the holidays. This set is quite nice looking and fits in nicely with the holiday decor.</p>

<p>The build was, in all honesty, nothing special. A few parts, such as the decorations on the side of the cars,&nbsp;didn&#39;t hold as well as I would have liked, the tracks were hard to put together and came apart too easily, and some sections were a bit boring. But the end result is delightful. I particularly love the Christmas tree on the flat car, as it spins around as the train moves, which is a very nice touch.</p>

<p>In addition to the train, there is a bench and streetlight where two figures wait for the train. In this section are a mother and son with their Christmas presents. The proportions here are rather skewed, and there are too many toys and packages to make it look neat or reasonable- it really just comes off as a chaotic jumble. Nevertheless, the idea is nice, even though I personally wish it had been toned down somewhat.</p>

<p>I do particularly like the minifigures&nbsp;for this set. There are two short-legged children figures, a mother, a conductor, and an engineer. They are all good figures and fit in with the scene well, and there was a place for everyone to be without it feeling crowded.</p>

<p>The real gem for this set, though, is the addition of the Power Functions. The added expense was admittedly significant, since it takes four extra parts to work, and I apparently wasn&#39;t paying enough attention when putting batteries in because it took me half a dozen tries to get everything working properly. The instructions for this portion were vague, and it was somewhat upsetting to have to dismantle a lot of work to add it in, not to mention the lost space took away the conductor&#39;s place and made it hard to hide away the wires. Despite all of this, though, it is pretty amazing to watch the train chug around the tracks under its own power. I left it running all day on Christmas.</p>

<p>The set is certainly not without its flaws. But it has a magical festive charm that is impossible to resist. It is not only one of my favorite sets, but a hit with the whole family. This little train will definitely be an ongoing feature in all of my holiday decorations.</p>

"HuskyDynamics","2018-12-24T18:06:48.107Z","Winter Holiday Train","<p>Just got this train out of the closet for another holiday season, and it is just as great as I remember.&nbsp; The Winter Holiday Train (set number 10254) is one of the latest additions to the Creator Winter Village line, and it is completely worth it!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Pros:</h2>

<p>This is a reasonably priced LEGO train (in addition to being, sadly, the last of the trains compatible with the IR remotes and equipment), and it is perfect for the holidays!&nbsp; Lots of decorations contribute to the overall wintery feeling of this set, from the wreaths on the front (nice part usage, LEGO designers) to the&nbsp;cheery little caboose behind the spinning tree on the presents car.&nbsp; Overall, this is a beautifully decorated set, and fits in perfectly with the line of Winter Village sets so far.</p>

<h2>Cons:</h2>

<p>There really aren&#39;t any.&nbsp; This is pretty close to being a perfect LEGO set.&nbsp; The only thing that I would nag about (if I really had to be picky and naggy) would be that the mechanism for the spinning tree puts some amount of pressure on the train motor, and the train runs much better without that car attached.</p>
