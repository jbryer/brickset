If you are a real collector, you obviously will want this set, because of its exclusivity. But it&#39;s nothing more than two mixels.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is pretty simple, not that big.</p>

<p>Its include two instructions manuals. one for each character.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set contains good small parts, and some of them in different colors. like the light blue, or the dark yellow&nbsp;1x1&nbsp;tiles.</p>

<p>But one thing that I still complain about every Mixel like set is the grey ball joints. It makes every model look like a robot, and in this set specially, makes it look bad :/</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build was pretty fun! the body of the two characters are the same, but in different colors,but each one has its own great bricks that in total makes it different.</p>

<p>I really like the bricks in Mixels&nbsp;sets. what&nbsp;makes good technics to build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>In overall its a nice set. you get two exclusive characters, which will be rare soon!!</p>

<p>so if you are a real Lego collector, I recommend buying this set, for its exclusivity. But if not, there are some Mixels series that are more attractive&nbsp;and cheaper than this one.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Its a rare set to add to your collection, but its a little pricey. nevertheless, if you get the opportunity&nbsp;of putting your hands in this set, buy it! &#39;cause it will get rare and real collectors would pay much more than what it worths in the near future.</p>
