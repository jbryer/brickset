<h3>Instructions</h3>

<p>Folded A4, which has a very nice picture of the large scale 75105 Millenium Falcon being constructed on the front.</p>

<p>44 pieces</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>My kids enjoyed making this, even when it was late in the day when the pieces were scarce. There were&nbsp;a few fiddly bits including the final gun turret and radar dish.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A diminutive&nbsp;8 studs long by 8.5 studs wide. &nbsp;The ship is unmistakable, even with transparent rear thrusters and side mounted cockpit. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Fairly playable except for the gun turret which is&nbsp;liable to fall off easily. &nbsp;Otherwise the rest of the model is pretty solid.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a chunky version of the Falcon, which is akin to the micro-fighters styled version. &nbsp;A nice addition to the previous Star Wars models TRU have given us, including the Poe&#39;s X-Wing and Wookie&#39;s&nbsp;Gunship.</p>
