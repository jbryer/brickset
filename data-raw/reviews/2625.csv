<p>But alas, I didn&#39;t have this wonderful little set. Now, as an AFOL, it&#39;s been an absolute delight to put together from vintage parts, and I can sit and stare at it for ages.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>The fact that this set includes a minifig as a baby/toddler kind of threw me when I first saw it in brickfactory.info a few years ago, but now I find it fascinating.</p>

<p>I like to imagine that back in 1980 the Lego designers of the &quot;new&quot; minifig were so proud and confident that it HAD to appear in big people sets thereby both preparing kiddies for the new style and also delighting those that were already collecting them. Just imagine a minifig collection back in 1980 - a whopping 10 minifigs! Wo.</p>

<p>Or maybe the designers of the maxifigs were petrified their jointed arm body would become obsolete and therefore insisted the little minifig must only be a supporting actor in any set.</p>

<p>Or perhaps the first minifig was originally MEANT to be a child and it was only later that they realised it was perfect as a replacement for the faceless, armless, and yet perfectly appropriate old minifig.</p>

<p>Does anyone out there know?</p>

<p>Regardless, I think this set rocks as one of the few that includes both a minifig and maxifig. It&#39;s rather &quot;land of the giant-esque&quot;, don&#39;t you think?</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions/Stickers</strong></h3>

<p>The original stickers were mostly on assembled bricks and are therefore tough to find these days, but hey, I&#39;m okay with that... grumble grumble grumble. I&#39;ve made my own, plus a wonderful box and printed out the instructions so that I can recreate the whole experience.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>This site says 26 pieces but it&#39;s actually 160 so the value for money back in 1980 was about 2c per brick - awesome! Lots of tiles (usual for homemaker sets), some larger cupboards and drawers, lots of white 1x bricks and that lovely blue baseplate. Plus the little hairbrush, clear cup and shovel which are always fun.</p>

<p>The build has its moments because there are quite a few components which eventually come together to reveal a very satisfying room. The miniature toys, in particular, are oh so cute to build and remind me of both the current day micro builds and also some of the extremely addictive tiny builds in very old instruction books from the early 70&#39;s.</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>With stickers applied (or in my case, gloss-printed homemade copies) this is an extremely colourful, perfectly balanced, intricate little model with huge potential for little hands to hide things in cupboards, play with the toys, move from the cot to the bed, pretend to be asleep then wake up, add a Lego light brick to the bedside, etc etc.</p>

<p>I give this set a solid 4 overall, as anything lower would be an insult to the amazing designers of the day.</p>

<p>Gee</p>
