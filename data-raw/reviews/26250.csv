And the set, while simple, has a nice astetic appeal. And there is enough room to have three minifigure knights standing in front of the shield dock.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The real value though is&nbsp;with the white shield and the shields on the back of each character card. If you play the app game these are very useful to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lego sets always have extra parts and this set had two which were the blue handle piece at the top (behind the shield) and a grey base piece.</p>

<p>Note that the instructions were a separate sheet that was not folded up in the bag but was separate. One can find the instructions online on Flickr and other picture servers.</p>

<p>Overall this is a small but useful set. The addition of the shields for the characters in the app game make this a terrific value!</p>
