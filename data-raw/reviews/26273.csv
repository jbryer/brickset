"TK_1308","2017-01-05T17:06:27.19Z","""We must get these ships off the ground, now!""","<p>Lego continues releases from Star Wars Rebels with the Kuat Drive Yards Pelta Class Frigate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>A nice large rectangular box similar to the ones used for ships in this class. Chopper is the figure of choice on the top with Ahsoka Tano, Ezra Bridger, Commander Sato and Agent Kallus in the panel next to him.<br />
The front of the box shows the ship in a combat situation in deep space. The back shows the ship landed on a planet and plucky Agent Kallus taking on all the rebels himself. There is the blue tech spec panel and 6 more showing the play features.<br />
There is one large almost A-4 instruction book.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The price per piece ratio is as expected for a kit this size. Primarily light and dark grey with a fair few maroon pieces for the detailing.<br />
There are 7 bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains parts for the lower primary hull, Agent Kallus and Ahsoka Tano.<br />
Bag 2 contains parts for the internal hull structure and primary hyperspace engine.<br />
Bag 3 contains parts for the deployable sublight engine assemblies.<br />
Bag 4 contains parts for the aft section port, starboard and dorsal hull plating.<br />
Bag 5 contains parts for forward section cockpit area, port and starboard turbolasers and the lower forward hull plating.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 6 contains parts for the forward sections port, starboard and upper hull plating.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 7 contains parts for the aft section upper hull, control tower, point defence laser turrets. Ezra Bridger, Jun Sato and Chopper.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The set comes with five minifigures.<br />
Ezra Bridger comes decked out in his series 1-2 clothes of jumpsuit and jacket. He has smiling and serious faces on his head. Detailing is okay but better on the belt and legs with some reflective elements in the design. He comes armed with his stunner / lightsaber.<br />
Chopper is the same as all previous releases. A nice little droid but nothing new.<br />
Agent Kallus is another reissue but he&#39;s still a nice figure. The detailing for his armoured uniform and unique helmet design make him stand out amongst Imperial troops. He has smiling and serious faces on his head. He comes armed with his black Lasat Bowrifle.<br />
Next we have Commander Jun Sato. This is his first time released in minifigure form and he&#39;s quite a nice one to add to the collection. His head has serious and shouting faces. Sadly his body does not have that much detail on the torso and no printing on the legs at all. I&#39;m also not too sure about the choice of skin colour as it&#39;s almost a sand / yellow tint which is wrong.<br />
Finally we have my favourite, the adult Ahsoka Tano. This is a superb minifigure. Her highly detailed head has the Togruta markings and features serious and shouting faces. The new head piece is excellent with lots of details. Her tunic and trousers are similarly details with a high level of precision and the silver highlights add to the effect. She comes armed with her twin lightsabers. If there was one thing to fault this figure for, it&#39;s that her lightsaber blades should be white or clear and not blue. That aside, she&#39;s one of the best minifigures in the Rebels range to date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Total building time, 60 minutes.<br />
The build itself is nothing unusual and follows the same general pattern as any heavy cruiser vehicle made to date with a good solid internal structure with attached hull plating. The look is very close to the on-screen counterpart and the designer has tried to incorporate a lot of detailing on the hull to complete the look.<br />
Like all larger ships, there is a carry handle which drops down into the dorsal hull. The use of Technic pieces in the aft section for the deployable sublight engines is well done, sturdy and fluid in its movement without being loose.<br />
There are 9 stickers to apply. Two are for the control consoles. Two are for detailing on the command tower on the aft hull. The remaining five are for detailing on the removable roof section of the forward hull.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The Pelta-Class frigate is a great model and a nice display piece, especially when twinned with 2015&#39;s Imperial Assault Carrier. While several feature have been added for playability, this ship suffers the same lack of internal play features as all other ships in this class of kit.<br />
The forward dorsal hull plate lifts off and reveals the interior. There are two control stations and two seats and that is all. Clips for storing Ezra and Ahsoka&#39;s weapons are behind the main cockpit. While it seats 4 figures, those occupying the control stations have to lay down in order for the roof to go back on.<br />
The turbolasers on either side of the cockpit rotate the full 360 degrees and each has a spring loaded missile launcher. The aft point defense lasers, represented by stud shooters, also rotate the full 360 degrees and add to the ship&#39;s arsenal.<br />
For me, the best part of the design is the deployable sublight engines. By rotating the main drive unit, the port and starboard assemblies rotate outwards until they&#39;re 90 degrees out from the main hull. The Technic gear mechanism for this is well done, sturdy and works flawlessly.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>A great ship and resembles the on-screen version rather well. While the minifigure selection has some highlights (Jun, Ahsoka) you feel that perhaps something more could&#39;ve been added like a couple of Rebel Troopers to man the ship. A good solid entry into the Rebels series and definitely worth adding to and Rebel fleet collection.</p>

"D_O_S","2017-01-06T03:23:26.34Z","Fantastic Star Wars set","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Rebel Combat Frigate is a very well-done addition to the lego star wars universe. It has many vibrant colors and building techniques which make it a good set. It is rather on the high side but it does contain one exclusive minifigure and the only Asoka minifigure with a normal lego face.</p>

<p>Whats in the box?</p>

<p>&nbsp; The box contains 7 numbered bags of pieces and a large instruction book with 130+ pages</p>

<p>The Building Experience</p>

<p>The building experience was quite enjoyable. There was nothing tricky but some complex angles to achieve the shape the ship has. It took me 2.5 hours to build which was fairly fast. It also has some faulty areas which were minor but can cause difficulties while playing with it.</p>

<p>The Final Set</p>

<p>The set was fairly large and measured 15.5 inches with the wings folded in. It&#39;s handle was stable and it was lighter than others ships similar in size. The playable area was ok but it&#39;s shape made it hard to accommodate minifigures. The interior was fairly blank but it is possible to seat 4 figures, 6 in a tight environment.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>large 15 inch build</p>

<p>Asoka minifig (worth $35-50 on it&#39;s own)</p>

<p>Captain Sato minifig (exclusive to this set)</p>

<p>Fair building experience</p>

<p>likely to gain value in the future</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>$110 (a little high also is not found for a decent discount)</p>

<p>roof is not perfectly stable (walls are low)</p>

<p>Toys R Us and shop at home exclusive</p>

<p>Some large gaps between panels</p>

"npapag","2022-05-10T17:24:21.08Z","An old classic worth owning.","<p>For anyone who loved watching the Star Wars Rebels TV show, this piece is a must and is worth all the money (I got it at an airport at EUR160). I find it unique, and it also has the figure of Ashoka. The outside is very successful. But one has seen the respective Rebels episode in which it appears, one will understand that the interior is not successful at all. Nevertheless, I&nbsp;was&nbsp;very satisfied during its construction and it fits nicely when playing with other sets.</p>
