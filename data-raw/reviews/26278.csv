It is a simple build, without too many interesting techniques, but still enjoyable. The finished build is a matter of opinion, I don&#39;t think it looks too bad, but I have heard many negative views on it. It&#39;s legs can swing from side to side, and it&#39;s arms can move thanks to some mixel&nbsp;ball joints. The part where it really shines&nbsp;though is it&#39;s parts value. It doesn&#39;t have too many rare parts, although there are some nice orange curves used on the pumpkin. However, it does have 163 parts, which is pretty good for a retail price of $9.99, although it can be bought for cheaper on bricklink and EBay. Hopefully you find this review helpful!</p>

<p>The build itself was fairly simple with some cool (simple but appreciated) details:&nbsp;</p>

<p>- I like the movable legs with the hinge pieces, as well as the movable arms with the ball connection.</p>

<p>- Green base is a nice accent.</p>

<p>- Accent color pieces as belt and show buckles.</p>

<p>- mouth has visible &quot;teeth&quot; with 2 1x1s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Things I don&#39;t love:</p>

<p>- The spinning nose... Just a little odd and gives it even more of that Pinocchio vibe I think is generally part of the negative reaction to the overall look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Not a whole lot of playability, but the should be expected in a smaller seasonal piece like this... More of a festive build activity and decoration than anything else.</p>

<p>Overall, 163 pieces is a pretty good buy for retail $9.99.&nbsp;</p>
