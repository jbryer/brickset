<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Interesting the tape that is part of packaging goes directly onto the frame itself, it didn&#39;t rip when removed the packaging but if you decide to purchase one of these be careful when removing the packaging. Also the cover only displays a &#39;baddie&#39; would have been better to show some of the Avengers on the cover.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instructions are one sheet however the inclusion although helpful is really not needed on this occasion. You can see where the ministands need to go from the picture on the packaging.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>3 pieces make up the mini stand. A DBG 2x2 plate, a smooth stepped curve piece, also 2x2 and a modified vertical plate. I have used these pieces this way before and I have to admit it is very effective. Good way to use them in the future for different displays!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Unfortunately no minifigures come with the stand. It would have been nice to get one with the stand even if it was not an exclusive. Might have encouraged more people to buy it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Simple and easy and not much to it. This is not a set for building, it is a simple display frame with under 50 pieces that make up the mini stands the minifigures go onto.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Does look effective once all built and your own minifigures are added. Here is a quick snap from my instagram account UK BRiCKS. Please not the frame does not have a front cover to it to protect the minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I think this is ideal for kids who want easy access to their figures, it does not have a glass or plastic front so you can gain access quickly and easily. You can also pose you figures as their is no front to the frame and also add accessories to you minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For AFOL&#39;s I imagine most of us would prefer to use our own methods with a protection so dust does not go onto our figures and we have less need to get them out and &quot;play&quot; with them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Score</h3>

<p>Overall I would give this Marvel Super Heroes Display Frame 68 out of 100.&nbsp;</p>
