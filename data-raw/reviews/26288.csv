"AdeelZubair","2016-07-01T12:03:15.787Z","A Faithful Tribute","<p>This is a follow up to the very successful 5002812 &ndash; Classic Spaceman Minifigure from 2014 and 5003082 &ndash; Classic Pirate Minifigure from 2015. It was no surprised that LEGO was going to continue this rather special trend of celebrating classic themes through these exclusive promos.</p>

<p>This set is a direct homage and tribute to 6012 - Siege Cart; a small impulse LEGO Castle set released exactly 30 years ago. Unintentionally this promo becomes even more special as it&rsquo;s released a few weeks after the passing of Daniel August Krentz, a retired LEGO designer who worked at LEGO between mid-1970s until 2000. Daniel is known to many us as the designer of 375 &ndash; Castle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>The primary aspect of the box design is very reminiscent of most of the boxes between 1960 &ndash; 1965; the white studs covering the entire box and the LEGO logo in the top left. The box doesn&rsquo;t scream attention to the contents much like the current products do, instead they show a small and simple vignette of the set with an extract of the booklet included and the 2016 stamp. Other nice details of the packaging include the LEGO System logo from 1950s on three sides. To open the box, you have to slide open the drawer on the right hand side which contains the pieces and booklet.</p>

<p>Not only does the contents of the product reflect the classic sets, it&rsquo;s also presented through the packaging and experience as you open the box which is one of the many reasons why this series is clearly a success. These easily have the best packaging of any LEGO product alongside Architecture, LEGO Ideas and the two exclusive Technic sets (41999 &amp; 42056.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Booklet</strong></p>

<p>The booklet starts off with the simple instructions to build the Minifigure and model. It follows up by documenting the classic LEGO Castle sets through a timeline starting with the origins leading up to 2016&rsquo;s Nexo Knights. Which follows a similar pattern with the previous two promos in this series. With the future instalments I can only guess it will be a similar scenario by promoting a new theme / sub-theme that links back to a classic LEGO theme.</p>

<p>Surprisingly this also comes with a sticker sheet / postcard; the stickers are images of Minifigures represented throughout the Castle themes as well as the two LEGO logos. On the reverse side it&rsquo;s a typical postcard design with a &lsquo;castle / knights&rsquo; twist! I wish it was just a postcard with an awesome print showcasing this set instead of the stickers which slightly decreases the exclusivity of&nbsp;this promo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The Minifigure is a near replica of the official castle sets, the difference being the weapon of choice; the long axe is a rather odd choice, perhaps an alternative weapon such as a bow and quiver could have been included instead. The printing is fantastic, both on the torso and the shield. I really appreciate that the torso or printing wasn&rsquo;t over done or didn&rsquo;t represent the &lsquo;classic&rsquo; torso. That&rsquo;s was one aspect that took away from previous promo (5003082 - Classic Pirate Minifigure.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>The only noticeable difference between this model and the one included with 6012 - Siege Cart is the use of brown slopes over plates for the front bow shape, my guess is they weren&rsquo;t available in the 80s. Besides that, pretty much every detail and feature from the original model has been replicated into this model, including the shield attachment at the front!&nbsp;Much like the printing they&rsquo;ve stayed faithful and not over done the details to bring the design into modern day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Analysis / Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Comparing this promo to the previous two; it&rsquo;s easily the superior of the three! Not only does it reflect and celebrate the classic castle theme it also gives a faithful reproduction to a classic set: 6012 - Siege Cart; rather than including a random assembly of parts as did &lsquo;5003082 - Classic Pirate Minifigure from 2015. It&rsquo;s a perfect example of what a faithful homage and promotional product should be!</p>

"Ladondorf","2016-07-07T04:27:11.6Z","Missing Piece!","<p>I got this set on my birthday yesterday along with the latest version of the&nbsp;Millennium&nbsp;Falcon. It comes free with any large purchase directly from LEGO by VIPs. Unfortunately, my copy came with an error which is a shame coming from an exclusive set such as this.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is made from a higher quality material than your standard LEGO box. It&#39;s print pays homage to classic LEGO boxes from the 60&#39;s. It even comes with the 1958&nbsp;version&nbsp;of the LEGO logo. This set is noteworthy as its contents are accessed by sliding out a little tray within the main box. On the back is a picture of a knight from the 2013 Castle theme.&nbsp;Inside are the bag of parts, the instruction booklet and even a sticker sheet containing stickers of various knight minifigures&nbsp;from across the years along with two versions of the LEGO logo. The other side of the sticker sheet appears to be a post card. The instruction booklet, I believe, is&nbsp;also of higher quality than the standard. The pages that come after the instructions themselves display the evolution of LEGO Castle.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Keeping with the &quot;classic&quot; theme, most of the parts are pretty basic pieces that have been in production for a long time. The ones that stand out the most are the dark brown spears and the slope pieces used for the front as they are newer pieces. The main reason to get this set, however, are the knight&#39;s torso and the two shields. They each come with the classic Lion Knights print first seen in 1984. It&#39;s a bit of a shame that the brown and grey colored&nbsp;elements included&nbsp;with the set have to be molded in their new counterparts which slightly detracts from the classic feel. As stated earlier, my copy of this set came with a missing piece or rather the wrong piece. The set is supposed to come with two brown slope pieces for the front of the cart when mine came with one brown curved 4x1&nbsp;slope and an extra 1x3 black slope. It&#39;s sad to see an error like this. That slope brick was a major part of the model aesthetically&nbsp;and I&#39;m not entirely sure I have an extra one in my&nbsp;collection. On the other hand, though,&nbsp;I guess it makes my copy even more exclusive.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with one classic Lion Knight. He&#39;s a great addition to the collection for people didn&#39;t have a chance to pick these old castle sets up when they were still in stores. Even people who own the originals will appreciate a classic knight figure&nbsp;in brand new condition. He comes with a dark grey axe&nbsp;as an accessory. I find it odd that the knight&#39;s helmet is molded&nbsp;in light gray rather than dark gray, which was the color used for the original Lion Knight figures. The front of the box along with some promotional art even suggests otherwise.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building the set is very easy as the model&nbsp;based on older LEGO sets which tended to be very simple.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model is actually a homage to set 6012 Siege Cart. It remains incredibly faithful to the original with the only differences between the two builds being the differently colored brown and grey pieces, the use of dark brown for the spears rather than old brown or even reddish brown, the redesigned front of the cart and the minifigures. The original set included two while this set only includes one. The knight in this set, as previously stated, comes with a light grey helmet and an axe while the equivalent figure from the old set came with a dark grey helmet along with a quiver and a bow and arrow.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Very nice little set. I like the idea of these little promotional sets that pay homage to classic LEGO themes. I wonder what the 2017 set will be if they&#39;ll even make one. Perhaps it&#39;ll&nbsp;be based on the original town theme as that&#39;s the only classic theme that hasn&#39;t had a dedicated promotional set, although that wouldn&#39;t be very exiting. Out of the three existing sets, I highly recommend&nbsp;getting this one&nbsp;as it&#39;s the largest. It also has mostly period accurate pieces, especially on the minifigure, which is something I can&#39;t say about the classic Space or Pirates set. The latter, in particular, being extremely disappointing with no attempt at recreating anything from the original Pirates line. I actually became a LEGO VIP just to get this set. I recommend doing so for yourself, as well. It&#39;s absolutely free and as a result, you get cool stuff like this. I&#39;m still disappointed about the missing piece, though.</p>

That model featured two Knights, an archer and a regular knight to man the cart. It&rsquo;s really a great nostalgic build for older fans of LEGO Castle and I&rsquo;d recommend sharing the build with your children, if you have children of course, to recapture the fun of the vintage Castle set.</span></span></span></span></p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-03-30T19:38:53.077Z","Perfect throwback to Classic Castle ","<p>This set is for children from the 80&rsquo;s. If you still have your Classic Castle sets, this will fit right in. Plus if you never owned any type of castle themed cart it will fill in that missing gap in your collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I picked this up on Bricklink for $6 which is a tremendous value, especially compared to what it would cost just to part out a Classic Castle set without the minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The packaging is beautiful and can easily be opened by slicing through a sticker without damaging the box. Included is a postcard with stickers of minifigures throughout the years and an instruction book on heavier stock than usual. The first half of the instructions are the instructions themselves, the second half is a history of castle sets and minifigures in picture form. In a way it reminds me of the catalogs that used to come with sets back in the 80&rsquo;s, much more elaborate than the pictures of other sets in the back of instruction books today.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set itself is pretty true to 6012 with an exception of some curved slope bricks that are much more visually appealing. The minifigures and shields are perfect, I&rsquo;m sure before long I won&rsquo;t even know which ones came with this set as opposed to being from my childhood collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I only own two castle sets, 6080 which of course is probably the greatest set ever, and &nbsp;6041 which is nice little add on. While I&rsquo;ve been able to expand my (much larger) Classic Space collection while keeping to a 10 cents per brick budget, I have not been able to do this with Castle sets, so I&rsquo;m very glad to have picked this one up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is like any small set from the 80&rsquo;s, nothing too technical about it. On its own it doesn&rsquo;t do much, but for a child of the 80&rsquo;s, this set is perfect!</p>
