<p>When building this, you can build a 6&quot; version or a 12&quot; version. There are printed pieces for both options. The 4x20 green base plates are nice to have, but they seem to have been cut. There are a fes 2x4 plated of various colors, one light gray 2/16, and two white 2x12 plates.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a really nice set. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a cool little LEGO made thing that can be used for real life situations.</p>
