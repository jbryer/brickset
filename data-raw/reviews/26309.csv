<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong>The A-Wing Pilot comes in a polybag. Only shows the pilot on the front. There is no instructions for the pilot.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong>The set comes with 5 pieces. The only unique piece is the helmet of the pilot. It&#39;s a new piece so it was nice to get it in the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigure:&nbsp;</b>The A-Wing Pilot has a lot of detail. The pants are just normal red pants. The body on the other hand has a lot of detail. It shows the perfect detail for the pilots suit that they would wear during battles. The head is a doubled sided head. One has a yellow visor and the other without the visor. The helmet has a unique shape and has some nice detail on it as well. The pilot also comes with a pistol, which is really nice to get for the pilot.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong>Since there are only 5 pieces I think I don&#39;t I have to say anything about the build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong>My overall opinion on this is that it is another great Lego Star Wars minifigure. The detail on the pilot is very good. The addition of the pistol is also very nice. My overall opinion on this set is a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set was my first star wars polybag. It was last December, I think you had to spend &pound;25 on star wars to get it. I must say, it certainly did impress!</p>

<p>As a polybag, there is no box. That&#39;s all there is to say.</p>

<p>As a minifig-only polybag, there&#39;s no build. Once again, I can&#39;t say any more.</p>

<p>Literally the only attraction of this set is the minifigure. And he is superb! His helmet is truly a contender for the title of best star wars headgear ever released. It is the b-wing pilot style launched in 2014, but with amazing new printing. the 3D microphone is black, with some beige detailing on the sides and some grey mechanical details. An insignia is visible above the gap and some dark red stripes on the top. The back is dark green with a grey cross. there are six yellow ovals, each containing a black TIE, presumably representing kills. Although the only issue is that the back of his helmet is never seen in the episode, so this is a creation of the designers&#39; imaginations.</p>

<p>The head is simple but effective. On one side is a determined grimace and an orange visor. The other side has a slightly worried expression (maybe he knows his fate...).</p>

<p>The torso is red with a dark grey flight vest. There is a highly detailed life support pack and a white belt. The back has the vest and the belt, that&#39;s all. The arms are plain red with white hands.</p>

<p>The legs are plain red. No printing. they kind of let the figure down, as pilots are shown later in the series to wear the same trousers as Hera. A black blaster pistol rounds out the figure.</p>

<p>This is a wonderful figure. Plus, if you have the a-wing Vs tie advanced set, this guy will fit in perfectly; he flies a green a-wing (and gets blown ?up by lord Vader). So, that&#39;s it. Grab it if you can. Trust me. It&#39;s worth it.</p>

They have appeared in The&nbsp;Return of the Jedi, where it crashes into the Executor, forcing it into the Death Star II, The Force Awakens, The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker. Lego have made 7 full size sets and 3 miniature sets. This is The A-Wing pilot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It came in a poly bag with no instructions.</p>

<p>The helmet is very detailed with a microphone type communicator printed on the side. There are some mini Tie-fighters on the back of the helmet, whose relevancy is questionable. His head piece is double-sided; on one side he has an orange with a frustrated expression. There is no visor on the other side with a sad frowning face. The torso is printed with a white belt and breathing devices. His arms are plain red with white hands. The legs are plain red with no printing. He is armed with a small black pistol.</p>

<p>Overall, this a very good poly bag, one of the best Star Wars mini figures I have.&nbsp;I think the new helmet is ok. The best bit is the head, especially with the visor but all of it is good. No rebel base would be complete without this minifig.&nbsp;</p>
