<h3>Bag/Instructions</h3>

<p>The standard foil bag with re-sealable back. The Acklay is nicely pictured on the front, even if it does look like it&#39;s leaping &#39;Spider-Man&#39; style into the arena. Nothing of note on the back.<br />
Instructions are included inside the magazine on the flip side of a poster.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>A nice little 49 piece set and worth it for all the nice light green, dark green and sand coloured elements in it.<br />
All contained in the one bag.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Total building time, 2 minutes.<br />
Nothing unusual in the build and it&#39;s a pretty straightforward kit with regards to construction.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Acklay is a very nice kit for something so small. It has double joints to all six legs at both the body and the knee, making the beast very poseable. The head can also angle downwards and a small white disc is present to represent the teeth inside the creature&#39;s jaws. The eyes are nothing more than clear discs on either side of the head but it gets the basic design across.<br />
It can walk on all 6 legs for you can stand it on the back and middle legs to raise the front pair in attack position.<br />
The body is approximately 8cm in length and can stand anything up to 9cm high, depending on how you position the legs.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Attack Of The Clones is a somewhat neglected child of the Star Wars Lego universe and it&#39;s nice to finally see something new from the movie in Lego form.<br />
It goes nicely with other Geonosis sets and hopefully we&#39;ll get the Reek and the Nexu soon to finish off the collection.<br />
Definitely my favourite giveaway with the magazine to date.</p>
