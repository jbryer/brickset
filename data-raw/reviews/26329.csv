Doomsday:</b> Now on to the second set I picked up from LEGO DC Super Heroes. This set features some nice builds and is the first and only Doomsday we&rsquo;ve gotten up to this point.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Doomsday: This short-legged murderer of Superman features wicked facial hair, spiked shoulder armor, Macy&rsquo;s hair piece in white and a grinning expression that shows he&rsquo;s going to be victorious and knows it. He also has a club accessory and includes some decent torso printing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Wonder Woman: With a lopsided smirk and a simpler torso print this short-legged Wonder Woman is full of personality and confidence as she takes on the worst villain the DC Universe ever created, the one to destroy Superman. With her sword and shield she&rsquo;ll be ready to do battle. A great little Minifigure.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The Mighty Micros</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Something I neglected to mention in the other review is the fact that each model in these sets uses a separate manual. The folded pamphlet style looks similar to Polybag instructions, and is just as easy to follow along with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Wonder Woman gets to drive a miniaturised version of her Invisible Jet using mostly clear and white elements to make a cute little penny racer style car to drive. Doomsday drives a fire spewing bone and tooth element filled vehicle of sheer destruction. Each model is loaded with personality and fun to play with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Similar to the other sets in the line it is difficult to find these outside of the secondary market. Most retailers sold out quickly. I was fortunate enough to find this and add it to my collection and I recommend folks who enjoy these types of sets should try to get them. They&rsquo;re great for play and fun additions to anyone&rsquo;s LEGO collection. The new elements introduced with the wheel attachments is also highly versatile, so MOC fans will probably covet them.</p>
