Bizarro:</b> It&rsquo;s taken me some time to figure out the best approach to reviewing these sets. I believe an approach similar to the Microfighters is in order, however we shall not be discussing things entirely in the same fashion. Mighty Micros was introduced in 2016 as a sub-theme of LEGO Super Heroes, DC and Marvel. As with most of these things it would appear they are no longer in production as no new Mighty Micros have been announced, which is a shame, because as a toy these things are actually very well designed.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bizarro: Mighty Micros sets include short-legged comical styled Minifigures. Great for folks who enjoy quirky characters or parts for trick-or-treating Halloween kids. The printing is fairly similar to other versions if slightly less detailed in certain areas. Bizarro comes with a purple cape and a piece of green Kryptonite.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Superman: This short-legged version of Supes has a fun little smile on his face and includes a red cape and a piece of blue Kryptonite which is Bizarro&rsquo;s weakness. Both capes are the newer styled material which suits the design of the Mighty Micros much better. Superman is a cute looking version with some design elements.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The Mighty Micros</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Each box contains two Mighty Micros in one set so that you can duke it out in wacky style races between the short-legged Minifigures in each set. The models take very little time to build, in the case of this set we have two models that are opposites of each other. Superman&rsquo;s model is primarily blue in color with two fists on either side in the front, a printed element with his S shield and a tailfin on the back.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bizarro, in contrast, is the reverse of Superman. Built primarily with purple colored elements the vehicle is a distorted mirror version of Superman&rsquo;s where the tail is now the front and the front is the back. In keeping with Bizarro&rsquo;s nature. Both vehicles are fun to roll around and play with and are very cleverly designed using the same base part for the wheels and creating something unique and fun.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">These sets are definitely worth owning, the problem is finding them at this point. I would recommend these types of sets for folks who want a quick pair of models to build so you can have super hero vs. super villain fights within twenty or so minutes of building. Other folks may choose to skip these, especially if they didn&rsquo;t buy them when stores still had them in stock as I do not feel they&rsquo;d be worth higher secondary market prices.</p>
