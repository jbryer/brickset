"BrickNerd2k16","2017-05-22T21:57:33.807Z","Meh, ","<p>I strayed away from the first wave of Mighty Micros because I didn&#39;t see the appeal of the vehicles and minifigures, but when I saw the early images for these sets I decided that I would test the waters and get this set. My initial thoughts were that I was in it for the minifigures (especially the new Iron Man helmet), but I wasn&#39;t interested in the vehicles because that style wasn&#39;t to my taste. Now that I&#39;ve been able to build and spend some time with it let&#39;s see if my mind has changed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>The box art is fairly simple, yet comical. It shows Thanos&nbsp;taking on Iron Man, using the infinity stone&nbsp;to steal that new silver color of wrench.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The build is really easy and quick. I took me less than 5 minutes. it&#39;s also a very simple build which makes sense given the age range of 5+.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Parts</strong></p>

<p>Surprisingly, there were a lot of rare pieces in this small set.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Like all other Mighty Micros sets we get two exclusive minifigures. As stated in the name&nbsp;of the set this one contains Iron Man and Thanos.</p>

<p>Iron Man uses the new helmet mold also used in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76077-1/Iron-Man-Detroit-Steel-Strikes"">76077:&nbsp;Iron Man: Detroit Steel Strikes</a>, although with a different print. He has a very comical face underneath and surprisingly&nbsp;enough they include the Superman hairpiece which only adds to the set. The torso has very simplified print which matches this style, unfortunately this limits the use of this torso outside of the set.</p>

<p>Thanos, like Iron Man has simple printing and an overly expressive face. He comes with the Infinity Gantlet and a shoulder armor piece which matches the big-fig version of this character.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Set&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The car Thanos drives is in the shape of the Infinity Gantlet and has on it all but one of the Infinity Stones. While it&#39;s missing the red stone, because of where it sits it would be complicated to get to be there without it looking odd and I&#39;m sure the designer experimented with ways to add that final stone. I like the look and feel of this car more than I thought I would and I appreciate the moving&nbsp;fingers.</p>

<p>Iron Man&#39;s car is less impressive and smaller. I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s supposed to represent, but I do like that the color scheme matches the figure. I may need more time to enjoy this build, but nothing immediately stands out.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I came for the minifigures and that&#39;s what I feel I left with. There isn&#39;t anything special about the vehicles that puts them above the standard for this style of vehicles. As for this sub-theme as a whole I don&#39;t think I will be revisiting it any time soon. I&#39;m certainly most happy with the figures and parts. I didn&#39;t think the building experience or play value is great either. As for the price. I think it&#39;s right where it should be. If it was down to $7 or $8 dollars that would be better but that wouldn&#39;t change my feelings on this set. It&#39;s really an ok set. I think younger kids could have a lot of fun with it, but for teens and adults it isn&#39;t that great.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-29T23:19:20.5Z","Mighty Marvelous Micros!","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #76072 Mighty Micros: Iron Man vs. Thanos:</b> The all-powerful Titan and Iron Man duke it out in the Mighty Micros world of LEGO with this first Marvel inspired set from the sub-theme I intend to review. This set features some impressive design choices, but is rather hard to come by these days.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Iron Man: This short-legged version of Tony Stark is wearing armor which is rather similar to his iconic Mark 1 armor from the comics. It&rsquo;s the classic red and yellow colour scheme with very minimal print detailing and the single piece helmet. His goofy looking expression is typical Tony and he includes the necessary studs and cylinders to simulate flight. He also includes a wrench in light grey and a spare hair piece for when he&rsquo;s not wearing the helmet.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Thanos: The Titan is rather diminutive in his short-legged form. With a huge victorious grin on his face and some simple design elements evocative of his comic costume he&rsquo;s ready to wipe out half the universe with his cute golden Infinity Gauntlet. Overall a fun little version of the iconic Marvel villain.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The Mighty Micros</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Iron Man&rsquo;s vehicle is a lot less impressive than most of the DC sets I&rsquo;ve built so far. This model uses relatively limited parts and seems to be trying to look like a cross between Tony&rsquo;s sports car and his armour. It has four engines mounted on the back, so perhaps this vehicle can fly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Thanos&rsquo; Might Micro is the stand out of the entire set. It is a huge replica of the Infinity Gauntlet in car form. Five 1x1 round tiles in different colours represent the five Infinity Stones and overall this is just a bloody brilliant little vehicle to build and play with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Thanos is the big seller from this set. Iron Man is nice and all, but could have used more thought in his vehicle design as in comparison to other vehicles in the sub-theme this one is just overall weaker. Overall though I&rsquo;d still recommend picking this set up if you can still find it if only because Thanos and his Mighty Micro is well worth the asking price. Strongly recommended.</p>
