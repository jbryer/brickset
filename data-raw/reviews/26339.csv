<p><strong>Packaging and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>We get a very colorful set up with the packaging. The shot reminds me of little cast cars that I used to ram to pieces when I was a kid.</p>

<p>We get no stickers, thankfully, but do get&nbsp;some fun parts, particularly the clear attachment piece that allows figures to hold items perpendicular to their body. I love those and you get two in this set. We also get 2 of the under-carriage pieces unique to this line. I am tempted to make a giant humanoid of LEGO and use those as roller skates. Plus a printed 1x2 blue cheese slope piece with&nbsp;the X-Men logo on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you finish you will get these for spare parts as well as spare cape in purple and it is the newer soft&nbsp;cloth type which I really like.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>We get two very cool figures here. Or at least they are cool for me since I grew up reading the Uncanny X-Men and then X-Men so their color scheme is attractive to me. They have these very well done faces that look pretty comical and remind me a bit of the cartoon style from the 90&#39;s animated series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Magneto gets a two-sided face though the one revealing his face scanned poorly due to the all black base. The opacity for the skin color just isn&#39;t thick enough to overcome the base color. He looks a bit pasty, so I prefer his all white eyes print instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wolverine gets a very angry face with a growl off to the side and it looks hilarious. I like it a lot.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>The completed set is fun. Wolverine gets a really stumpy version of the X-Men Blackbird and it looks pretty nice as a kind of go-cart. It gets the printed slope piece on its nose.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Magneto rides a huge magnet and it looks funny. The set is remarkably well representative of both the characters and their factions/personas.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>Overall I have to say if you are fan of X-Men and you do not yet have a version of either Wolverine or Magneto then this will be a good buy. You can easily add regular sized legs to these and add them to your existing collection if needed. Plus they&nbsp;both have highly emotive faces so they are useful for other situations as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only that but my kids love racing these about, so they do have play value in their simplicity. And best of all they seem to hold up well when bumping into each other. Cute and fun all in one package though I can see why that might also be a turn-off to some. Still I recommend it.&nbsp;</p>

Magneto:</b> Only the third set to be released featuring characters from the X-Men, this Mighty Micros set features the third Wolverine and Magneto releases in Minifigure form. I guess these characters are super popular. The set overall is fairly nice and is quite fun for build and play fans.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Magneto: This short-legged villain is classic in design and print, and he&rsquo;s sporting a dual-sided head. One side is just an ordinary face surrounded by a balaclava or whatever the black is meant to hold. The other side shows a blank face with glowing white eyes in a large scale, looking more like a Spider-Man or Deadpool mask then an actual persons&rsquo; eyes. This is done to make him look more sinister I believe and is really cute and suitable for a character like Magneto.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Wolverine: Without a mask for the second time in Minifigure form, this short-legged version is perhaps almost the right scale for the short and powerful Canadian born mutant. He&rsquo;d probably be better in scale with his team mates with mid-sized legs, however this short-legged figure is definitely cute.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">He&rsquo;s got a very great facial print with some wicked side-burns and a berserker expression on his face as he charges with his claws to do battle with Magneto. He&rsquo;s got the yellow costume on as well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The Mighty Micros</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Magneto is driving a very clever little build that is basically a cartoonish horeshoe magnet on wheels. The colour scheme and the overall build is a fun little model that is great to just roll around and race with. There are some transparent blue elements are used to simulate magnetic effects&hellip; it should have been purple, like the accessory which was included with the driver, but I can see where the blue elements might be more numerous to use.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Wolverine is driving a miniature Blackbird. It&rsquo;s an awesome looking model too which works fairly well despite the LEGO flag elements being used for wings have little space to clip on. There are a few printed 1x2 sloped elements, the gauges used for piloting and the X logo on the front.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The builds in this set were both fun and enjoyable for what they are and look great together.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It&rsquo;s nice to see more X-Men inspired sets. I&rsquo;m slightly disappointed that all we have gotten so far are Wolverine and Magneto in large quantities when there are so many great characters to see and collect. That being said it makes sense for them to be used here and I love the look of this set as a whole, I strongly recommend tracking it down if you missed out on it and add it to your collection.</p>
