But I never really pay any attention to it because I kept it inside a box and only took it out whenever my sons were having their birthday. Last month my youngest son was having his second birthday when I placed this 40226 set along with 40153 and 40348. I have yet to get 40382 and 30565 to complete the Birthday sets.</p>

<p>And I also wonder why there is only <a href=""https://brickset.com/article/28626"">one official review from Brickset</a> and then I realised this set is exclusive in Asian region only and even Huw ordered it from the country that I live which is Indonesia to get it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the photo above, you can see the male version of this cake that is indicated by the eyes without lashes. Those eyes are actually stickers though. As you can see, this build is sort of a hybrid between cupcake and a creature. At first, I thought this build was sort of cartoonish creature, but then, I saw the candle on top of the upper body of the brownish creature. After further inspection, I realised that this creature looked like a cupcake.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, this is a happy cupcake creature that is holding a happy birthday flag and a yellow balloon.</p>

<p>From the photo above, this is the feminine version of the cupcake with the eyelashes. Probably the male and female version will depend on the child or adult that is having birthday. Again, the eyes with eyelashes are from stickers. Too bad they are not printed tiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rear side is pretty simple as you can see from the photo above. When doing the LEGO review, I realised that the bottom part of this set looks like Obelix from the Asterix comic by&nbsp;Ren&eacute; Goscinny and Albert Uderzo. When I was a kid, I read the comic book of Asterix, hence, I am familiar with Obelix and the bottom part of this part looks like Obelix&#39;s pants.</p>

<p>This set provide stickers with &ldquo;Happy Birthday&rdquo; words in several languages such as English (used in the photos), Deutsch, French, Spanish, <em>Hangugeo</em> (Korean), <i>jianhu&agrave;z&igrave;&nbsp;</i>(Simplified Chinese), <i lang=""zh-Latn"" title=""Chinese-language romanization"">Zh&egrave;ngtiz&igrave;&nbsp;</i>(Traditional Chinese) and <em>Nihongo</em> (Japanese).</p>

<p>I wish the LEGO Group will create more stickers that cover more countries including Indonesian language as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, for this set, I think there will be only two opinions. Either people will love it or people will hate it. For example, my wife dislike this build as she finds it very strange looking build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>Well, building LEGO is always fun. And I usually enjoy building small sets when I do not have enough time for larger builds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>It is okay, not many parts for this small set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Can not really play with this set. It has only a display value which is restricted to Birthday theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>If you can get it for low price like what I paid for in Indonesia, then it is great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Special Note</strong></p>

<p>Please note that this review (in Indonesian) is based on the review on my LEGO blog from:&nbsp;<a href=""https://indobrickville.com/main/review-lego-40226"">https://indobrickville.com/main/review-lego-40226</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this insight from me will be useful for all AFOLs out there!</p>
