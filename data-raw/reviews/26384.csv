<p>I&#39;ve got several Batmobiles, and I love them all, but while they tend towards the sleek, this brawny black bruiser is the baddest&nbsp;one since the Tumbler.<br />
<br />
<strong>Box/Instructions</strong><br />
<br />
I rarely have much to say about the boxes, and this review will be no exception.<br />
<br />
The instructions come in two parts, with the second, thinner book basically dedicated to the wheel assemblies.<br />
<br />
Each of the numbered bags contain one of the five minifigures to build as you go along. &nbsp;I have to say I like that. &nbsp;I&#39;m a huge fan of minifigures, especially when it comes to the DC and Marvel Superhero lines (having bought a few sets just to get them). &nbsp;Having one in each of the bags is like a small treat as you progress. &nbsp;It became something to look forward to, and I think it would be a pleasant idea for TLG to continue. &nbsp;I know it&#39;s happened more-or-less in other sets, but I don&#39;t remember it happening before in any large set that I&#39;ve bought.<br />
<br />
<strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are a few parts in here that I really like. &nbsp;The stubby wings at the back, for instance are nice. &nbsp;I think if the older-style, huge dragon wings had been used, as they often are, it would have not worked as well as these ones do. &nbsp;And of course, new moulds almost always open up new opportunities for building.<br />
<br />
I love the black gold ingots. &nbsp;They add an interesting touch of texture to the build, and will have lots of future MOC applications. &nbsp;I hope this means that other colours are coming/available.<br />
<br />
The printed black 1x1 round brick and yellow 1x1 round tiles are great. &nbsp;I love the yellow tile especially. &nbsp;I want to put little bat symbols on everything.<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>As I said, I love minifigures - especially the Superheroes. &nbsp;This is my first standard TLBM Batman (though I know I&#39;m fated to have many, many more). &nbsp;I absolutely love the utility belt piece. &nbsp;It add a little je ne sais quoi. &nbsp;That&#39;s not to say that it&#39;s superior to a painted on belt, but I do like the variety. &nbsp;Plus, I can see it coming out in other colours in the future to be a cool accessory for non-Batman themes.</p>

<p>Usually the worst thing about Batman is Robin. &nbsp;I loathe Robin in pretty much any non-Nightwing incarnation. &nbsp;Having said that, however, <em>this</em> Robin looks good. &nbsp;The dual-moulded sleeves and legs, the bright colours, the disturbing underpant thong, the shiny yellow&nbsp;cape all come together in an aesthetically pleasing, brightly coloured, surprisingly lovely minifigure. &nbsp;I&#39;m even coming to terms with his stupid green goggles on his stupid Robin face - that&#39;s just how good this minifigure looks.<br />
<br />
But he&#39;s not allowed to hold that&nbsp;adorable Bat-merch&nbsp;Gun. &nbsp;He <em>is</em> Robin, after all.<br />
<br />
One of the things that I like about the CMF run for The LEGO Batman Movie, and most recent wave of DC sets is the inclusion of lesser-known characters. &nbsp;The Kabuki Twins are two that I&#39;m not particularly familiar with, but it&#39;s nice to have a couple more characters to add to my Rouges Gallery. &nbsp;It&#39;s not likely that they&#39;ll ever be released in another set, so this is the only real chance to satisfy the completist monkey on my back.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m of two minds over Man-Bat, though I think I favour the second mind. &nbsp;I already have Man-Bat from 76011, and this one is exactly the same. &nbsp;Plus, I don&#39;t really see what Man-Bat has to do with a ground-based set. &nbsp;In 76011 he was pitted against the Batcopter, more appropriately. But that&#39;s the perspective of a 40-year-old pedant&nbsp;with a discretionary income.<br />
<br />
That Man-Bat was originally released three years ago, in a long-since-retired set. &nbsp;If kids today, or people just emerging from their Dark Ages, want one, and don&#39;t want to have to hunt through the secondary market (and who-knows-what-prices), then this is a good opportunity. &nbsp;I favour this situation. &nbsp;I&#39;ve got a young daughter who loves both LEGO and comics. &nbsp;I have no problem with obscure figures being re-released in sets down the road.<br />
<br />
It also brings up a minor excursion into value. &nbsp;This set is already $75 dollars retail in Canada. &nbsp;That&#39;s not peanuts. &nbsp;So, if re-using a Man-Bat adds a minifigure (fittingly or not) for the kids (and some adults), helps keep the price slightly reigned-in, and even slightly reduces the prices for said minifigure on the secondary market, then I&#39;m onboard 100%.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>I could say lots and lots and lots about the build, but simply put it was one of the best builds I&#39;ve ever done. &nbsp;It was a lot of fun. &nbsp;There were a few techniques I thought were interesting. &nbsp;I also liked some of the parts usage. &nbsp;For instance, the grey air scoop near the windscreen is brick-build, simply and elegantly, using 2 or 3 parts. &nbsp;It would have been so easy to just add the air scoop brick. &nbsp;But this one also works with the lines of the vehical and is, I feel, clever.<br />
<br />
The build is pretty stable throughout the whole process, which is good, because you have to rotate it a lot while building (or at least, I did). &nbsp;That stability stays through to the completed model. &nbsp;Speaking of which...<br />
<br />
<strong>... The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>This thing looks awesome! &nbsp;It really does.<br />
<br />
Say what you will about stickers, those licence plates and Bat Symbol hub caps are pretty. &nbsp;I&#39;m generally not one to engage in the sticker/printed piece debate.<br />
<br />
Likewise, I love the dragon-spine grill at the front. &nbsp;I keep wondering if it would look better in black (or very, very dark grey), but it works for me. &nbsp;It also leads the eye to the excellently placed Batarang hood ornament. &nbsp;It&#39;s a little bit Batman attitude and Bruce Wayne Rolls Royce extravagance that is sublime and delightful.</p>

<p>And while the joke may be that the Batman works only in black, and sometimes very, very dark grey, all the while never doing that exactly, I want to say that the inclusion of red here and there was inspired. &nbsp;The red pin-striping, both brick-build and sticker-added works to make this Batmobile a real 70&#39;s muscle car style beauty.<br />
<br />
The greebly look of the undercarriage and wheel assemblies is satisfying in a Top Gear petrol-head way. &nbsp;And the six pipes coming out of the enormous engine housing look great.</p>

<p>It&#39;s got the near-ubiquitous stud shooters, but they are discretely hidden by the stubby wings, and don&#39;t stand out distractingly on the model like a thoughtless Marketing Department tumor.</p>

<p>This is going to look great on my shelf, for years to come, and even better in the I-really-will-build-it-one-day-honest Bat Cave MOC I&#39;m planning.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps it&#39;s my Scottish blood that makes me balk at $75 dollars for a set.</p>

<p>And though I was lucky enough to find it on Kijiji for $30, I have to say that it would have been totally worth the retail price. &nbsp;It&#39;s big, it&#39;s awesome, it&#39;s solid, it&#39;s surprisingly heavy. &nbsp;Five minifigures, one of whom is a Robin that almost makes me not hate Robin, make for immediate play value.</p>

<p>Just as Dick Grayson wandered through the Bat Cave, growing more excitable with each Bat-vehicle discovery, so to has my progression, through various LEGO incarnations of the Batmobile, led me to this baaaad mutha&nbsp;of pure delight. &nbsp;She&#39;s not like her slinky sisters. &nbsp;This lady is all beautiful BT1TUDE.<br />
