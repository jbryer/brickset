<p><strong>Box and Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Alright first I founded this set in one of my local stores and I buyed it for about 40&euro;.So you get one nice big box with some nice box art.On the back you get little pictures with some functions of the set. Then when you open the box you get some instructions and bags.</p>

<p>In the set you get 3 minifigure and they are: The Joker, Batgirl and Harley Quinn.First the Joker: I really like the face and hair but they are also the nice torsoe and pants in purple and orange.For the Batgirl I like the pants but everything else is boring.But for the Harley Quinn I have to say that she has nice hair, pants and torsoe.She also has some new prints and some rollers one is black and one is red.</p>

"Capit√°n_Skrall","2016-12-27T01:42:04.46Z","Unique and stylish","<p>Standing out in this&nbsp;first wave of The Lego Batman movie sets arrives the Joker&#39;s Notorious Lowrider. This flamboyant set is an enjoyable build, being overall a straightforward&nbsp;stacking of plates with a couple of interesting techniques like some technic linkage for the car suspension and snot for achieving certain details on the sides. This set also comes with lots of basic plates and tiles in purple, various gold pieces for external detail and a couple of unique tiles with a zebra like pattern.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigures are fantastic in this one, all three come with new molds, and the detail in the printing is just something else. Lego is really pushing and improving the looks of minifigures. They feel exciting, fresh and very fun, just look at the official pictures.</p>

<p>The suspension gives the possibility to drive this car in different configurations, having both axis in low or high positions independently, its even possible to lean the car towards its right or left side. There are also a couple of spring loaded missiles on the back side, just remember to open the trunk before activating them.</p>

<p>It&#39;s&nbsp;a&nbsp;big,&nbsp;purple, powerful&nbsp;looking car that fits perfectly with the style of the Joker, the Lowrider suits him as&nbsp;it has lots of&nbsp;character and a great&nbsp;style. I can definitely recommend&nbsp;this model at whatever price you feel comfortable with, since the release one&nbsp;definitely feels&nbsp;high.</p>

"Sethro3","2017-02-03T18:46:58.883Z","All my friends drive a lowrider","<p>Upon seeing this set for the first time, I knew I had to have it. The car is very fitting for the new age clown prince of crime. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;d see Heath Ledger or Jack Nicholson&#39;s version cruising around in it, but it&#39;s a new day and a new Joker.</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>- Color scheme is spot on for Joker. The main body being purple with the lime green canopy is very fitting. And it provides a good array of new pieces in that color for the first time (or at least in only a few sets).</p>

<p>- New unique pieces in general! Per Brickset&#39;s inventory which is only 96.1% complete, there were 20 pieces found only in this set (not including minifigure pieces) and I know this inventory is missing the other seat cushions at the very least. Of those 20 pieces, almost all are in purple!</p>

<p>- The printed pieces stand out. As I&#39;ve become older, I don&#39;t mind stickers as much because I know they can have a purpose, especially for the target audience. But I do love printed pieces. The new 1x1 round tile for the speaker is really neat and&nbsp; the animal printed tiles for the seats are must haves.</p>

<p>- New minifigures are always welcome. In this situation, you get 2 exclusive variants of figures. Joker is without his jacket compared to his other versions. This reveals his vest and undershirt much better. Also, Harley is unique to this set. This version shows a jacket over a Smylex t-shirt. If you recall Smylex was the brand of poison Joker used in 1989 Batman. This version will be different from the summer Harley (she has a tutu and a different top). Plus, Batgirl if you don&#39;t have the Catwoman set. She is highly detailed as well and in more of a classic color scheme.</p>

<p>- Clever build techniques creating the suspension. This lowrider bounces with the best of them using technic liftarms and rubber bands underneath.</p>

<p>- I like that you can fit two figures in the car, unlike the Penguin roller.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- It&#39;s an odd con, but this thing is massive. The picture looks scaled down compared to how long it actually is. For the sake of a toy AND an animated movie, this fits in well with other vehicles in the range. But in terms of your normal city, this will be way too large. I may try my hand at scaling it down to fit in better. It has a great shape and details though, so the size doesn&#39;t bother me too much after the initial shock.</p>

<p>- By adding in a play feature for the missile launcher in the trunk, it does remove some useful space to put things. Granted, I doubt Joker and Harley are going on vacation anytime soon, so maybe this con isn&#39;t a big deal. Plus you can shoot at Batgirl if she happened to be running directly behind them.</p>

<p>- Speaking of the above, Batgirl doesn&#39;t have any vehicle or scooter/motorcycle to chase after them. Even a comically small car could have worked in terms of some of the other sets.</p>

<p>- The price is absurd. $49.99 for 433 pieces and only 3 figures seems a bit high. I would definitely wait for a sale. I found it on amazon for much less than MSRP.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>I would highly recommend this set. I think it has a lot of good qualities -- new figures, new pieces in purple, overall a nice looking vehicle. I think a lot comes down to how are you going to use it and cost. As stated above, I would recommend waiting for a sale. With the movie coming out soon, it is possible they will have some sales. Either way, get it. I doubt you will regret it.</p>

"TimTam22","2017-11-21T09:34:52.97Z","Joker's Lowrider not a Joke","<p>My little brother got this set for his birthday recently, and I have not yet had the chance to build this one, but I am looking forward to doing so. From what I have seen/helped with in this build, it seems quite interesting, but I am not going to go into much depth, as I don&#39;t want to be misleading.</p>

<p>This set is probably the only one where you can get a golden chicken piece, which stands as an interesting hood ornament. The Zebra-stripe seats are cool, but don&#39;t get your hopes high for these - there are only four of the zebra-stripe tiles. The tyres are slightly&nbsp;different than in most other sets, but I am not quite sure how. They were much harder to get onto the wheels than usual, and my thumbs were aching after the second one! Harley Quinn sports a red baseball bat, something that I am fairly sure is unique to this set, but still easily useable in other builds.</p>

<p>This set has a couple of interesting features, but for a good LEGO experience, I think that you will need another vehicle for Batgirl&nbsp;to drive to make a good story from it. The car has a functioning suspension system, but it sort of defeats the sets name of &#39;<em>low</em>rider&#39;, as the body is a good few centimeters above the ground. There Are some flick-fire missiles in the boot (hatch) of the car which are controlled by some buttons behind the driver&#39;s seat, a firing technique that I have never seen in any other sets. I would have liked to see something else inside the front of the car, as there is plenty of space there, but has nothing but bricks. Also, the car is clearly a convertible, but is stuck in an open-roof position. I can&#39;t help but think that a sliding roof would not be too hard to make!</p>

<p>This set looks very nice and has many unique pieces, but could have more. I would, however, still but it, despite some shifty value for money.</p>

"KoolKreeper489","2018-11-19T01:02:34.66Z","The Joker Notorious Lowrider","<p>The Joker Notorious Lowrider set is an excellent set from The Lego Batman Movie theme. It includes The Joker&#39;s Lowrider and 3 minifigures. It was released in 2017 for $49.99 and has 433 pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><strong>Batgirl- </strong>This minifigure is similar to most of the Batgirl minifigures in The Lego Batman Movie theme. This exact version was in 4 sets total. She has nice printing and a great new cowl piece that her hair connects to. 9/10</p>

<p><strong>Joker- </strong>This version of The Lego Batman Movie Joker has a vest with nice printing. He has a hair piece that is new for him that looks good. He comes with the basic bang gun joker usually has.&nbsp;10/10</p>

<p><strong>Harley Quinn- </strong>This version of Harley Quinn has great printing all around. She has a new hair piece made for her. She comes with roller skates and a nice printed bat. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The Joker&#39;s Lowrider is a great build with good play features. It has rubber bands under it to make it go up and down which is a great lowrider function. The trunk opens to reveal two spring loaded shooters. The lowrider has printed zebra pieces for the seats. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>This is a fantastic set with great minifigures and an awesome build. The minifigures have great prints that are detailed all around. This set is good for playability with the lowrider function that works really good but also looks good on display. This set is one of my favorite Lego Batman Movie sets and I would recommend it if you can get it.</p>
