"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-28T10:11:35.453Z","LEGO Studios - Air Boat Review","This is one of the smallest LEGO Studios sets I have. It has almost no play features. The only feature you get is that the propeller on the back sviwels full 360Â°. The built of this set is very easy and it's a very sturdy set. We also get a comic book with this set and you won't have to worry about stickers as well. This set comes with the LEGO Rock Raiders minifigure Axel. This character is in many LEGO Rock Raiders sets and for some reason we get him in this model, too. This time he has a dark gray helmet with a black visor. I think if you plan to get some LEGO Studios sets I would recommend you to buy the bigger ones first before you get this little set.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
