They are often sold out and very collectible. To that end, when it comes to LEGO Minecraft expect a lot of interesting ideas, case in point, this and its sister set also known as Minecraft Skin Pack give fans of Minecraft and LEGO Minecraft the option to mix-and-match to create custom avatars, just like in the games.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The blister carded packaging design found on most LEGO Store exclusives of this nature is rather plain when the Minecraft packaging design is used. It&rsquo;s covered in the green and brown imagery commonly found on all Minecraft packages which signifies the building aspect of the game. The back shows you the characters in the set and one option for mixing the parts up, there is very little in the way of interesting imagery and again I say this type of package is comparatively plain.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Minecraft Skin 5: The first custom avatar is a male character in black and silver armour. His print detailing is limited to the front of the torso and legs, and his head of course. He includes a light blue sword, which I think represents the strongest version of that weapon in the game if memory serves. He&rsquo;s really quite impressive, despite coming out at a time when dual-molding was not an option.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Minecraft Skin 6: Our second Skin is a character that can represent any gender, they are dressed in a green and dark brown Creeper costume and carry a bow. Again the print detailing is limited to the legs and front of the torso with some very impressive design cues. He or She can wander through a hoard of Creepers without fear&hellip; I hope.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Minecraft Skin 7: The third character is dressed in a Blue Shirt with the Porkchop Icon printed on the torso. I&rsquo;m not sure if this head has been used for a version of Steven before, the print has the character looking to the side in a shifty expression. They are carrying the spade accessory.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Minecraft Skin 8: Last, but not least, is a character dressed in a Dark Blue Jacket with Bright sand blue legs. The printing is rather interesting, I believe I read somewhere that this was meant to be somewhat like a Han Solo costume, though I could be mistaken on that front as it honestly doesn&rsquo;t look much like Han Solo. Although it does remind me a Pirate Minifigure from the 80s, at least the dark blue jacket with the gold buttons does. A silver axe accessory rounds out this Minifigure.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A few additional accessories are included with the set to offer a small amount of building. There&rsquo;s a Torch and a TNT block and of course a little red apple so your chosen avatar can snack on something to replenish energy while building in Minecraft.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Purchased on Clearance, this set was marked down to 14$ CND and change compared to the original asking price of around 18$ CND. Not a huge drop in price, but a decent enough option. This set however is not going to appeal to everybody, only folks who want optional prints on the Minifigures in Minecraft will go out of their way to pick these up. I&rsquo;d recommend tracking this down only if you have a strong interest in the prints, otherwise it isn&rsquo;t worth the asking price on the secondary market. Somewhat recommended.</p>
