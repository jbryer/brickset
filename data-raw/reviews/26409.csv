"Slithus_Venom","2020-11-30T02:19:19.53Z","Excellent, But Wish They'd Make a Third One!","<p>Here&#39;s a set I own with no review yet! This is the second of two LEGO Minecraft Skin Packs.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience:</strong></p>

<p>Given this is a small, minifigure-centered set, the building experience isn&#39;t anything special. You&#39;ve got seven builds, and four of them are basically the same routine.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The parts included in this set are highly versatile within LEGO Minecraft, but less useful with other themes. The furnace and torch parts will be appreciated by Minecrafters; you can&#39;t have too many! The carrot parts will be appreciated by many people inside and outside LEGO Minecraft, as minifigure food is popular. Each minifigure part is exclusive to the set.</p>

<p>As for the minifigures&#39; tool accessories:</p>

<p>The warm gold sword included appears in nine other sets, but as of 2016, when this minifigure pack came out, it had only been available in two others. The reddish-brown shovel had appeared in two other sets before this one; it is now available in a total of seven sets. The medium azure pickaxe had made five other appearances, of its fourteen. The silver metallic pickaxe had also made five other appearances, of its ten. Any discrepancies may be because of certain sets, such as this one, having Rebrickable part inventories instead of database inventories.</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>

<p>The set includes four characters, each with tools, and some other accessories. I believe that any set with an appropriate selection of minifigures is going to be pretty playable. On its own, you can have the characters in this set mine, dig, attack, eat, explore, and cook. This set greatly enhances the playability of other LEGO Minecraft sets, in my opinion, because it includes characters other than the Steve and Alex. Steve and Alex were the only player characters available, except for in the two skin packs. This was true up until 2018&#39;s #21145, The Skull Arena, I believe, made other characters more common.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money:</strong></p>

<p>The price per part might scare you at first, but you must remember this is a minifigure pack. At $15 USD, each minifigure is less than $3.75, which is a fair price. I would say it&#39;s worth the money, especially compared to today&#39;s Collectible Minifigures that cost $5.</p>

<p><strong>Displayability:</strong></p>

<p>The set shouldn&#39;t be displayed on its own, but the minifigures are quality. They can be displayed with other minifigures and will stand out (in a good way). They are also unique, so will add variation to any LEGO Minecraft full-size set/MOC display.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>Note -- none of the characters are actual skins in game, but you could make a custom skin in their likeness.</p>

<p>The &#39;Knight&#39;:</p>

<p>The knight has neat printing on all front surfaces (face, torso, hips, legs, toes). He does not have arm, back, or side printing. His black/grey/silver and warm color scheme looks appealing. Furthermore, his silver printing is reflective, which is a nice touch.</p>

<p>The &#39;Blacksmith&#39;:</p>

<p>Nothing about the minifigure stands out as striking, but I think this works for a blacksmith look. The printing is on the same surfaces and is less complicated than the knight&#39;s, and none of it is reflective. The flower in her hair and pink cheeks on her face are interesting.</p>

<p>The &#39;Adventurer&#39;:</p>

<p>I like his head, as it is more serious than Steve&#39;s. The torso and legs are brighter than the blacksmith&#39;s, which makes him look ready for an exotic travel to a jungle, or perhaps an on ocean voyage. His white shirt printing on his torso is slightly darker than his arms, which is unforunate (the Astronaut has the same problem, see next paragraph). He is quite simple, but is honestly one of my favorite LEGO Minecraft players ever.</p>

<p>The &#39;Astronaut&#39;:</p>

<p>This character, who looks like a space traveller or robot, stands out from the other three. He looks futuristic, as compared to the historic-looking others. I&#39;m pretty sure he was voted most popular/fan favorite as this set was being created. Had he not been, another character would have appeared in his place. The use of the uncommon sand blue is nice. The red details pop. However, the white printing on the sand blue parts is slightly darker than the white arms. This may bother some, but it does not bother me.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>5/5 Stars. I would definitely recommend this set, although it may not be as exciting now that unique characters appear in most sets. If you like any of these characters, you&#39;ve got to get this set to get &#39;em (unless you buy them loose). I love the two skin packs, although I haven&#39;t gotten the first one. I wish that LEGO would continue the series with a third, fourth, and on.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-23T01:53:28.5Z","Accessories and Avatar Selections Part 2.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #853610 Minecraft Skin Pack:</b> Well it&rsquo;s about time I discussed the second, or rather first Minecraft Skin Pack. I reviewed them in reverse order because I purchased them in Reverse Order.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This shares the same packaging design as the previous Skin Pack. A blister bubble on a cardboard card, the design and art is the exact same. The back shows the Minifigures in this set and that&rsquo;s about it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Minecraft Skin 1: I have no idea why this set has Minifigures listed as 1-4 while the other one has them listed as 5-8, considering the set numbers list them in the opposite release window. This Minifigure is all grey with a very familiar looking armour pattern, it&rsquo;s the Minecraft Mandalorian. Meant to represent a character similar to Boba Fett this character has a highly detailed pixelated look. He includes a gold sword as an accessory and looks pretty cool.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Minecraft Skin 2: This female character looks fairly impressive, with the flower in her hair, some pink cheeks and a pair of suspenders, I have no idea what she&rsquo;s attempting to look like, but she&rsquo;s interesting. For an accessory she comes with the silver pickaxe thing. This Minifigure includes bare arms in a dark tan colour, if you&rsquo;re looking for those types of arms for a MOC Fig you&rsquo;ll need her.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Minecraft Skin 3: This might be Indiana Jones, or any other adventuring type of character, dressed in blue jeans and with a brown vest this Minifigure can represent anything you desire. The accessory he or she uses is the brown spade.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Minecraft Skin 4: It&rsquo;s a Minecraft Astronaut, dressed in a white and light blue space suit complete with bubble looking helmet print, this Minifigure is ready to travel into outer space. Who&rsquo;s under that helmet? A man, a woman, a horrible creeper human hybrid? Who can say, but this print is pretty detailed for a pixelated space suit. They even feature breathing apparatus. The accessory given to them is a light blue pickaxe.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with the other Skin Pack this one includes some extra accessories. This one isn&rsquo;t as build heavy, you get a carrot for rations, a torch to use when journeying into caves and a buildable crafting station or stove or something&hellip; I don&rsquo;t play the game, I think it&rsquo;s how you forge new materials though. Pretty minimal parts count for these accessories.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with the original Skin Pack review I would say this set is a decent one for Minecraft Minifigures if you&rsquo;re looking to populate your collection with different looking characters you&rsquo;ll want to pick up this set. The set has retired now so you will have to rely on the secondary market to pick this up. I like this set a bit more than the previous one as far as the printed designs go. The Space suit character and the Mandalorian inspired person are more impressive looking. So I recommend this one a little bit more than the first one. Highly Recommended.</p>
