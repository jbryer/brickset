<p>The boat is sleek with a radar and fish fighting seat that both can spin, and outboards that can be raised and lowered as if you were adjusting the trim in real life.&nbsp; A male and female angler Minifigure makes it perfect for any child who enjoys boating/fishing.&nbsp; The fishing rod &#39;hook&#39; is a small piece that connects to the nose of any of the three fish included.&nbsp; Just be careful you get it landed before the included shark grabs it!</p>

The back also includes a lot of fun and funny action shots, pretty decent from LEGO box designs.</span></span></span></span></p>

I&rsquo;d still recommend this set, it&rsquo;s a fun toy and involves some decent play features with the rotating chair that assist in fishing and the inclusion of a shark is very nice.

"Gerbil","2017-04-06T04:14:47.76Z","Sleek look, great colours, and that shark!","<p>I bought this principally to flesh out the bay area of my town, and I needed more &#39;normal&#39; boats so this seemed to fit the bill.</p>

<h2>Pros:</h2>

<ul>
	<li><em>A new (to me) shark model with enough space in the mouth for an entire fish - you really can catch the shark!</em></li>
	<li><em>Great colour scheme on the boat.</em></li>
	<li><em>Storage space for caught fish.</em></li>
	<li><em>Speaking of fish, 3 in 2 colours is not to be sniffed at.</em></li>
	<li><em>Female fisherman (fisherwoman?) - as I bought this along with #60149, this pushing of female protagonists is notable and very much welcome.</em></li>
	<li><em>Meaty twin motors.</em></li>
	<li><em>Accurate fishing seat.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Cons:</h2>

<ul>
	<li><em>Stickers on the side of the boat hull are quite big and can be a pain to align decently.</em></li>
	<li><em>The bouy isn&#39;t much use and doesn&#39;t add to the playability.</em></li>
	<li><em>Although you can take the roof off the cabin, it doesn&#39;t give you as much space as you&#39;d like for placing figures which can be fiddly as a result.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2>Overall impression:</h2>

<p>This is a nice model, and fits into any water-based scene with ease. It doesn&#39;t have too much playability, although the shark is so nice that that alone accounts for much of the fun here!</p>

<p>As an adult the boat floating isn&#39;t really a plus, but I&#39;m sure some kids will get more out of this set playability-wise than me as a result.</p>

"lentil","2017-04-11T16:02:30.903Z","Solid set despite lackluster graphics","<p>This little set packs quite the punch for the money! It is an unusual offering, with an intermediate-sized sea-worthy vessel that is much smaller than an oceanliner but larger than the ubiquitous small rowboats in Legoland.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Wonderful large, floating hull piece.</li>
	<li>Totally fab color scheme in Earth Red, two shades of gray, and white, with just the right amount of bright yellow accents. There are a fair number of interestingly shaped tile and plate pieces in Earth Red which are great additions to your piece collection.</li>
	<li>Superbly elegant design - the long thin hull and the streamlined, small roof canopy create sweet clean lines for the overall shape of the vessel. I also think the twin outboard motors are very attractively done.</li>
	<li>Multiple fun movable elements: the yellow chair spins around 360 degrees to enable the fisherperson to angle their rod in any direction, and the fishing rod can be anchored to the chair while they&#39;re waiting for a bite. This rod anchor is also hinged to allow the rod to be angled vertically up and down, to easily maneuver to that perfect fishing spot. The end of the fishing line can be snapped to the nose of a fish, or clasped inside the shark&#39;s jaws, to really catch some seafood. The sonar machine on the roof spins around, as do the propellers on the outboard motors. The two motors can be hinged up or lowered into the water at various angles, just like real boat motors. Finally, there are two small open compartments at the back of the boat where the fresh catch can be stored. Up to two fish can fit in each compartment.</li>
	<li>Two minifigures (one female, one male, both quite cute) are included, as well as a shark and three fish! That&#39;s quite a haul for a small set!</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The only criticism I have of this set is the stickers. Usually (like many AFOLs) I gripe incessantly about the use of stickers rather than printed pieces (while simultaneously complaining that the sets are too expensive, lol...), but grudgingly appreciate the fantastic graphic elements that stickers add to a set. This time, however, I think the set would have been better off without stickers/graphics entirely. The two stickers on the side of the hull have a cartoonish design which I find decidedly garish and unattractive. They just don&#39;t seem to harmonize at all with what is otherwise a beautiful, elegantly designed set. The rest of the stickers are so dull and non-descript that I really wonder why they bothered including them at all. The two fish storage coolers have thin black square outlines that look vaguely like a sketchy&nbsp;doorfront - barely visible and pretty pointless. The back of the hull has a sticker inscribed with the word &quot;Mary&quot; and a thin scrolly black wave. This one rather looks to me like it was done with internet clipart or a word processor font, rather than by a professional graphic artist. The sonar screen has a small sticker showing some teensy dot-like fish, reminiscent of a 1980s low-resolution video game. This is a cute touch in theory, but so small in reality that it is almost invisible. Overall the stickers here seem to be of uninspired design, and either don&#39;t contribute much or even detract from the overall look of the set. You may want to consider not applying them (too late for me unfortunately).</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the above sticker rant, I do think this set is a very good &quot;catch&quot; indeed! At only $20 RRP, it offers an incredible amount of detailed elements, fun playable features, and makes a lovely display piece for your LEGO harbor or sea-scape. If you can find one on sale, the value moves into incredible territory.</p>
