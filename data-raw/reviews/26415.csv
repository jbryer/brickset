I was mildly interested in the skyline series, but I don&#39;t know much about Australia, so I wasn&#39;t drawn to this as I was Chicago or London. However, I was gifted this set, so it gave me a chance to see what it was like. From reading the manual, I learned this build includes prominent buildings within Sydney -- Sydney Opera House, Sydney Harbour Bridge, Sydney Tower, and Deutsche Bank Place.</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>- Neat architectural details at such a small scale (like this whole line)</p>

<p>- Instruction manual has interesting tidbits about the four buildings used.</p>

<p>- Color scheme works well at this scale. The dark blue represents windows quite effectively.</p>

<p>- The shape is brilliant at this scale.</p>

<p>- Learning new techniques at smaller scales. The bridge is simple, but clever. The angled roofing on the Opera House is recognizable, even though it is just using hinges and roof pieces.</p>

<p>- Price per part ratio is good (under the &quot;normal&quot; 10 cent rule).</p>

<p>- Pretty sturdy. I&#39;ve moved it around a few times and nothing broke off. Unlike some other random LEGO builds that tend to be more fragile.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- Hard to display with my other architecture line since the scale is so different between them.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>With my limited knowledge, I&#39;m not sure if I would pick other buildings that are more iconic, but I think the buildings that were chosen represent the area quite well. Like any other set, I always recommend waiting on a sale which I think currently it is at close to 20% off on Amazon as I type this. But sale or not, I would recommend picking up this new series. They represent the cities and you get to learn a little bit about the area.</p>
