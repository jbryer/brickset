Unlike the horizontal nature of most Skyline sets, this set gives more emphasis on height, which is fitting for the birthplace of the skyscraper.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>Instead of using large plates the base is built with smaller plates and a printed city name tile. The layout of the buildings is not in relation to their real-life location, nor does it really need to be. From left to right:</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Big Red&quot;</strong>, also known as&nbsp;CNA Center,&nbsp;uses the SNOT building&nbsp;technique. Although the shade of red is more vibrant than the original (using dark red may have been acceptable too)m it adds nice splash of color to the set.</p>

<p><strong>Willis Tower</strong> uses a basic stacking building technique. The process is somewhat repetitive but the result looks very representative in the end.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Millenium Park is the tiniest of builds, with just two round tiles (which I believe are trees) and the single Technic&nbsp;ball joint in metallic silver to represent the lovely&nbsp;<strong>Cloud Gate</strong> sculpture.</p>

<p>The only &quot;action feature&quot; in the set is the ability to adjust the angle of the <strong>DuSable&nbsp;Bridge</strong> to your liking. I appreciate the inclusion of the Chicago River as well.</p>

<p>The <strong>Wrigley Building</strong> features more SNOT construction. Its biggest surprise is use of an inverted&nbsp;minifigure&nbsp;lipstick part at the top of it&#39;s tower. It sits at an angle using a turntable piece. As the one-time tallest building in the city, I appreciate the inclusion of an older skyscraper, which also serves to highlight the height of more modern skyscrapers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <strong>John Hancock Center</strong> employs the most interesting build. The end result isn&#39;t the most accurate, but the silhouette--it&#39;s defining feature--stands out. I wish the designers could have found a way to highlight the other distinctive feature&nbsp;of the building, the diagonal exterior elements.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model&nbsp;</h3>

<p>These skyline series sets&nbsp;are great at celebrating the larger architectural achievements of major cities. It is interesting to consider what other iconic Chicago landmarks might have made a worthy addition to this set. I would vote for the Smurfit-Stone&nbsp;Building and Lake&nbsp;Point Tower, although both would have been challenging to achieve at this scale.</p>

<p>This set looks wonderful on display. The price feels a little high but is in keeping with this &quot;premium&quot; (fancy box and instruction book), adult-oriented Architecture line.&nbsp;There is a pleasant variation in height, color and texture. This set would not look out of place on a work desk or book shelf. LEGO has made something&nbsp;Chicagoans&nbsp;can be proud of!</p>

"martiniman","2018-07-25T08:36:06.3Z","One of the best architecture sets with something missing along the river","<p>Finally an architecture set of the greatest city of the USA. For me as an architect I sometimes really like the architecture sets, but some I totally don&#39;t. This one grab my attention because it&#39;s not so dull in the colour scheme. The red building and the green St. Patricks day dyed river are eye catching.</p>

<h3>Selection of buildings and arrangement</h3>

<p>I think LEGO made a good selection of buildings from the skyline of Chicago. The two bronze anodized towers that define the skyline are there: Sears and Hancock. The choice of the red CNA is disputable, but a fresh accent to the set. If you want other structuralism icons, LEGO could have opted for the postal office square with city administration, or IBM building, but that makes it too black and square.</p>

<p>The Sears Tower is looking the best. The 1973 building is quite easy to make. It was a great choice to use bronze-translucent bricks for the windows. This gives the building the gold shine it has in reality. The dark grey for the installation floors is disputable. Black might look better, you can easily try that for yourself. Best part is the way the entrance is made! Very nice catch on the cylindrical atrium-like entrance in real!</p>

<p>The Wrigley (1924) is a nice early 20th century icon, fresh in white, on the river bank as in reality. Only minor issue is that in real it follows the river, here it is turned like in reality using a rotating plate, but situated in a gray square area, not on the water edge. And in reality is has two slabs with a bridge in between.</p>

<p>Nice thing is the buildings are kind of in accurate order when viewed from the Lake, with the Chicago river splitting down-town in North and South. In correct order of appearance from south to north are the red CNA building, the Sears Tower (I refuse to call it whatever it&#39;s called today), the Chicago River, The Wrigley Building on the side of the river and the John Hancock center on the Magnificent Mile / Gold Coast. Sears and John are rotated 90 degrees for a better silhouette. This is different from most other skylines where the arrangement is very random.</p>

<p>Finally there&#39;s the Cloud Gate in Millennium park. Using a simple ball part is effective, but it could use some more shine.</p>

<h3>Building Process</h3>

<p>The build process is very nice, there is a big variation on building techniques and the result of all the towers is really great. You could argue the John Hancock misses the external truss structure, but it would be really hard to incorporate that in a nice way. I like how LEGO solved the tapering. John, most masculine and strong looking in real, is the most flimsy tower here. It is a single 1x1 tower of bricks cladded with plates.</p>

<p>Sears is mostly stacking a lot of translucent, 1x1, 1x2 and cross plates. It also gives you a lot of 3x3 plates, which are not used quite often in other sets.</p>

<p>Most inaccurate are the bridges. Especially the colour is way off the real ones. Guess there were no reddish brown cantilever parts in the LEGO stock. Also the bridges are rather thick looking. We need a non studded cantilever part here.</p>

<h3>Marina City addition</h3>

<p>When I was building the set and had some technic gears I was thinking: hey, doesn&#39;t this look like a piece of a crucial building of the Chicago Skyline?</p>

<p>Yes, the Marina City is the thing I was missing in this set. It is the most extravagant building on the Chicago river, with nice balconies on the two 179m corncob towers. The lower part is a car park spiral, the top part has luxury apartments. The complex is set on a slab on the river, with boating quays.</p>

<p>So I tried some things with yellow belt wheels first, and after I liked the shape, I ordered the needed pieces in light tan. I decided to fix the Chicago architecture set to include the most unique piece on the city skyline: the Marina City apartments. I also think the addition gives the set some extra depth, it&#39;s pretty flat by default. The corncobs work very well the way they stand in real, the one further away sitting closer to the water, and the relation to Wrigley is accurate.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the final result:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/21033-1.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Frontal image, you see the problem with architecture sets: the base plate is made of too many small plates and therefor it curls up on the edges. Guess the Sears tower got knocked off at some point, now I see it is back on in the wrong direction.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/21033-2.jpg"" />Closeup on Marina City. Made of some gears and belt wheels, staying on a lifted plaza.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/21033-3.jpg"" />I added a second bridge, and made the top parts reddish brown as used on the real bridges. Also swapped the top parts of the bridge buildings, they are copper with a grayish patina, so metallic works better than sand. This image also shows how nice the entrance atrium of the Sears is done. As it is a half cylinder in real, LEGO had to sink the round plates into the base plate. Well done!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/21033-4.jpg"" />Here you see the extension I made to the river to give room to Marina City.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Lego Architecture 21033 Chicago is already an excellent set as sold by LEGO. The only thing awkward is the base plate construction. LEGO should really think of something for this. Think a similar long plate as a train base plate, but narrower and with studs on one edge. This is a problem in every skyline set. The kids have London and there it is flimsy as well.</p>

<p>I do think however, LEGO missed a chance to make this set unforgettable by adding Marina City on the river bank. So I decided to add it myself.</p>

<h3>Pro&#39;s</h3>

</ul>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Base-plate sucks, too flimsy and not straight.</li>
	<li>Hancock Tower is a bit flimsy, and a PITA to repair when knocked off.</li>
	<li>Marina City is a big omission</li>
</ul>
