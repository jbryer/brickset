<p>This set is one of the more interesting Lego Architecture sets out there, due to the iconic design of the building it is modeled after. Many interesting techniques are used, and there is a considerable variety in parts. It is not the easiest build - one needs to pay attention. The most repetitive part is the tan 1x1 stud tiling, but that is broken up nicely to make it manageable. The set is rather expensive side but I would still consider its price excessive, and especially on sale it offers good value for money.</p>

<h2>The design</h2>

<p>The set is a massive&nbsp;improvement of the 2009&nbsp;original (set 21004) - it is bigger, it has many more parts (744 vs 208) and the parts used in the 2017 set are more suited to rendering the shape of the building in Lego. The building now has greater depth, and the little bit of extra tiling around the edges now gives an impression of its geographic location - a block in New York City, with the famous yellow cabs on the road in front. Also, this set is nice to look at from all sides, even though the back of the building is rather boring.</p>

<p>A nice touch in&nbsp;the design is that the lettering with the name of the museum on the facade is replicated in this set, taking away the need to include usual 1x8 or 1x6 tile(s) with the title of the subject. Instead a white 1x8 tile and a white&nbsp;2x2 curved tile are included.</p>

<p>Also, the use of angular pieces, half-stud offset techniques and tiles to replicate the low walls delineating the property boundaries is nicely done.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>I had a lot of fun building the model, as many interesting techniques are used, and on occasion when building one wonders how it will look in the end. The choices made for the design of&nbsp;the internal structure (to provide enough rigidity for the building as a whole) and how to integrate the the 1992 rectangular expansion into that of the original Frank Lloyd Wright design are a nice feature of the build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build sequence is well thought out, generally one works on the various sections&nbsp;of the building, one after another.The one aspect of the build that could easily become tedious - attaching the 103 tan 1x1 tiles that imitate the texture of the limestone wall of the 1992 expansion - is broken up in parts so as not to become too tedious. However, lining them up perfectly straight is all but impossible.</p>

<p>Overall though, there is a lot of variety in this build. Many smaller parts are used, which explains why somehow over 700 pieces are used in what ends up being a fairly small and compact structure - a structure with only 7 studs showing on the outside. The rest is all covered up with tiles.&nbsp;The design also makes clever use of 2x1 stud in the middle tiles to create the right offsets for&nbsp;windows and various tiles.</p>

<p>As I am not too familiar with what Lego pieces have been introduced when and where, I cannot say for certain whether the sand green&nbsp;10 stud diameter disk and the two sand green&nbsp; 2 to 4 stud 2 deep wedges are new pieces or not.</p>

<h2>Display, no play</h2>

<p>This set is a display model, as are all architecture sets. Although fairly sturdy, the only safe place to pick up this set is by grabbing the base plate. Anywhere else, and you run the risk of dropping the set, and it breaking up in several pieces - as I found out the hard way. As a display model, it is nice for on the shelf or on a desk, being fairly compact in size.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>If you are a fan or the design of the Guggenheim Museum in New York, this is definitely a nice model to have. Its regular retail price is rather steep, IMHO, but still acceptable. If you can find it at a reduced price, it becomes good&nbsp;value for money - and definitely worth picking it up.&nbsp;</p>
