<p>I like the big wheels, which add to the aggressive style it was going for.</p>

<p>The clips add more detail to the ATV and is used apropriately.</p>

<p>The safe is nice and the stickers make it look even better.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a small nice set that is suited for a small city!</p>

<p>The only thing that could be done better is to make more space for the crook on the ATV.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
But I always want to look at it from the perspective of the kids coming after me.&nbsp; Police sets are automatically playable.&nbsp; For the young girls and boys just coming out of their Duplo days, there are&nbsp;always going to be several&nbsp;police sets released this year for them.&nbsp; It won&#39;t be the same sets year after year, but they will be there.<br />
<br />
TLG does a lot, increasingly so, every year to cater to us AFOLs&nbsp;(a not-to-be-ignored proportion of their customer base).&nbsp; But they also have to look towards the KFOLs today who will be AFOLs tomorrow.</p>

<p>So you can always do what I am generally doing now.&nbsp; Ask yourself not how many sets will they release, but rather how many sets&nbsp;do you actually need.&nbsp; I used to click every City police set box for &quot;want&quot;, even before Brickset would have a picture up.&nbsp; Now, I wait for the pictures, and decide then.<br />
<br />
This was one of the sets that didn&#39;t make the cut.&nbsp; I figured I already had a few police ATVs already.&nbsp; I can think of five that are specifically ATV sets (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60065-1/ATV-Patrol""><strong>60065</strong></a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/30228-1/Police-ATV""><strong>30228</strong></a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60006-1/Police-ATV""><strong>60006</strong></a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/30013-1/Police-Buggy""><strong>30013</strong></a>, and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/5625-1/Police-4x4""><strong>5625</strong></a>) and about another five larger sets that have them.<br />
<br />
I wouldn&#39;t say that any of them were superior to any other.&nbsp; So, I wasn&#39;t rushing out the door to get this one.<br />
<br />
However, I saw it on clearance today, and used some store credit at the local grocer&#39;s to pick it up for free.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to say that I&#39;m ultimately glad that I did for a few reasons.&nbsp; I like the light blue police shirt.&nbsp; I don&#39;t already have a shirt like this, as I&#39;ve been a bit more selective of my police purchases lately.&nbsp; I always welcome variety.&nbsp; Likewise, I don&#39;t have the crook with the brown overalls, either.&nbsp; I think even his face is new to my collection.&nbsp; And again, variety is prized in my ever-expanding City.<br />
<br />
The safe is also cute, with a good sticker.&nbsp; Another furniture dolly is no bad thing to have.&nbsp; And the gold bars are also nice.<br />
<br />
Basically, this is a decent set, and will no doubt be the first set for many future Lego Maniacs.&nbsp; You can pass on it, as I had pretty much done, and not really suffer for the loss.&nbsp; Or you can take a chance, and have another perfectly good set.</p>
