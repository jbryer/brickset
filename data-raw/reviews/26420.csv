"Sobel","2017-03-24T16:57:24.59Z","Another generic helicopter with some VERY nice cars!","<p>Ever since this set came out, I wanted to add it to my collection of LEGO helicopters. But in my opinion, 29.99&euro; was a little too much for a rather small-medium set. So I waited up a little and got it on a special sale for 19.99&euro;, which is pretty nice!! Along with this set, I bought the 2015 Millenium Falcon, so it missed out a little! ;-)</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Quite a large box, that is! Like always, lots of details on the back. Robust as always and nice to have! :-D<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Just standard parts for a helicopter and cars. Only exception perhaps is the roadblock. Again, the helicopter consists of rather big parts like all modern LEGO helicopter sets. It has a winch, as the only special functional part. Oh, and stickers! Waaay to many stickers (imo)!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with four (4!) minifigures, which I found to be quite remarkable for a set this size! It features a male cop, a female pilot and a male robber. Also included is an &quot;exclusive&quot; minifigure, this Agent guy, who drops from the helicopter, but has no such special looks to him...<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There are three instruction booklets, which leave not the slightest room for mistakes or difficulties. So, the build is pretty straightforward and almost frighteningly simple!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Starting with the helicopter, it looks a little... awkward. That is because it is so short, yet very high, with the engine-and-winch-complex towering above the main chassis. The center cabin is so low, a LEGO minifigure can&#39;t fit in sitting! That&#39;s lame, I think!<br />
The winch is easy to use, and there are even clamps to attach the hook at the end of the rope to, when not in use.</p>

<p>The two cars look very cool and sportive! I like their design much better than the one of of other LEGO cars, for example those in the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60097-1/City-Square"">60097 City Square.</a><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If it was only for the helicopter, this would be a poor set. In my opinion, the two cars add to it really great! But still, for the regular price of 29.99&euro; you still don&#39;t get that much. The set has a good playability and a good amount of minifigures, but not more. So for me, it&#39;s a so-so-set. I&#39;m happy to have it for the sake of my chopper collection, but I can&#39;t really recommend it, except for smaller kids, who want it just for the play.</p>

<p>Let me just say as soon as&nbsp;I saw it waiting on the shelf, I knew&nbsp;I had to get it.</p>

<p>it is reasonably priced at GBP24.99&nbsp;although I purchased it for a mere GBP19.99 (there was an offer!)</p>

<p>It is a brilliant building experience although it only consists of 294 pieces but another good thing about this set is that it is easy but fun.My favorite vehicle has to be the helicopter because LEGO&nbsp;haven&#39;t put many helicopters in sets often enough for the recent few years. The one thing&nbsp;I don&#39;t understand is why every criminal car in this years police range has to be dark red?</p>

<p>MINIFIGURES</p>

<p>I really like the policeman&#39;s&nbsp;hat and he has nice torso printing. I like chase McCain the most&nbsp;exclusive minifig to this set, he has a nice dark blue uniform a badge and a pair of handcuffs</p>

<p>The helicopter pilot also has a dark blue uniform and a helmet that is frequently used by lego.</p>

<p>The thief has dark grey trousers some orange workman overalls with a prison shirt print underneath, to top that off, he has a face with some stubble, an annoyed face with his eyes glaring and a few scars then a black cap.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;wish the price would be lower but overall it is still is an amazing set. Thankyou for reading!</p>
