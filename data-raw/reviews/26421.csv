"Privatematrix","2017-02-11T09:27:16.133Z","Cool little air racer","<p>Box: typical small set box, sealed with tape rather than thumb tabs. Box art shows the model manouvering &nbsp;through some inflatable cones in a city harbour, a fairly typical scene for an air race championship. The box contains two unnumbered bags of parts, a folded instruction book, and a sticker sheet.</p>

<p>Minifig: Nothing new here, but serviceable. Stunt team coveralls on the torso, plain black legs, head with aviator glasses, red helmet and trans black visor with spare.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: Fairly straightforward and conventional.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: A good selection of black, yellow and red parts as well as light bley and a few green hidden internally. &nbsp;Also one blue 2 by 3 brick, visible at the front of the cockpit. Notable are the yellow wing plates, black wedge plates, and one of the brand new wheel arches in red.</p>

<p>Design: Very sturdy and solid, but like most LEGO planes from official sets, the wings and tailplane are too short. I extended the wings with two 2 x 4 yellow plates and two black 2 x 2 tiles and it looks much better. I also swapped the 2 x 6 black plate that forms the tailplanes for a 2 x 8. Some 1 x 1 yellow tiles complete the job.</p>

<p>My only other (minor) criticism is the landing gear, which is fixed in place and is quite bulky, but it stands up well to rough landings.</p>

<p>Prototype: The Red Bull air race series uses a &nbsp;variety of high performance single engine monoplanes, so as far as this goes, it looks the part. This one is a tail dragger.</p>

<p>Functions: Canopy opens, prop can spin, prop clears ground in level take off run.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability: Very swooshable, open the canopy, pilot in and out, spin the prop for takeoff. My son played with this for an hour once we built it.</p>

<p>Overall: Good solid addition to the city aircraft stable. I give this set an overall score of 4. It was detracted only by the too short flight surfaces and fixed landing gear, overwise it would be a 5. I would recommend this set.</p>

<p><strong>Contents:</strong></p>

<p>The package looks attractive showcasing both the pilot and most prominently the aircraft he controls. A very nice looking box with the sky as the backdrop and what looks like an aircraft or floating landing deck on the back cover. Very fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside you will find an booklet which is thicker than I expected, 2 bags and one sticker sheet with 8 stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your left over bits will be the usual single studs and tiles and other miscellany.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>The minifigure included is fantastic. He has a great printed torso, front and back, and looks like he enjoys his job.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build is fun, and given the small size I was surprised by the little touches. The simulated engine exhaust the fun use of the new fender piece for the propeller housing and everything else accented with stickers just looks great. Plus those stickers were easy to apply.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>Excellent. For such a small set it actually manages to scale well with other planes in the City line and it sure looks the part of&nbsp;a racer. At first I thought the bulbous canopy piece would make for an awful look once the model was in hand but on the contrary it really brings the whole plane together and the pilot just looks wonderful within his little plane and getting a good view of him from all sides of the canopy really add displayability to the model as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If I were to get picky about any one detail&nbsp;it would be the lack of a rear landing gear, but that is easily overlooked since the design towards the rear makes it impossible to affix anything&nbsp;without looking strange.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong></p>

<p>This was a total impulse buy for me, saw it on the shelf and said why not? It looked attractive and fun. Put it together and sure enough my kids were off to the skies, they have not put it down yet. Totally worth it.&nbsp;</p>
