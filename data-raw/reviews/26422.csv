For Christmas I received one of the most wonderful gifts anyone has ever bestowed on me. The Lego Winter Holiday Train (10254). It completely encompassed everything I want from a Lego Set, something that has lots of &lsquo;aah&rsquo; moments as the build continues, something that looks good when finished and something that I actually find myself playing with rather than resigning to get dusty on a shelf. And this in turn led to an almost unbearable urge to buy more lego trains, or at the very least to order lots of little parts that I could build my own trains with. And therefore the impasse. I am somewhat broke.</p>

<p>Yet still I can&rsquo;t help but at least tease myself, and there is a Lego Store rather near my house. So on Saturday I went for a browse. A peruse of the wonders. Secretly I went to buy one of the new Batman Minifigs&hellip; But alas there were none, yet one thing did catch my eye. A little new creator set. Of what? Of course, of a Train. I resisted, foolishly, until Monday when I could no longer contain myself and bought the darn thing, it is after all only a fiver. And what a fiver well spent.</p>

<p>The build itself offers 3 options as is normal of these creator sets. Also as normal one looks far better than the rest and this is the steam locomotive. The box itself apparently contains 71 pieces and at the end of the locomotive build I was left with a mere 4 studs so it comes together very nicely. As a relative novice to the world of lego I was particularly enamoured with the clear plastic 2x1 lego bricks and the 2x2 with curved tops and studs. The first working to make the drivers window and the latter to make the engine casing. I also liked the lego plate 2x2 with wheel attachments as it really felt like I was building a miniature version of the Holiday Train and it&rsquo;s larger train wheel holder pieces. Although there was a momentary sadness as I was reminded of the drunken bricklink order from a seller with 0 feedback who I am now 99% sure will never send me my train parts. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The locomotive itself, as it seems of all the new creator 3 in 1 small vehicles, is made of 3 sections connected by technic pins which lends for 3 nice small builds that form to make a final whole. The only small negative is that I am not a complete fan of the 27 Degree 2x2 Right Plates used to cover up the front sides. I&rsquo;m not sure if some studs and 2x1 curved slopes might have been nicer but I think at some point it&rsquo;s something for people to tinker with if they so wish. Once complete it is decadently fun to roll about.</p>

<p>A little less fun is trying to get everything disassembled to build the next of the 3 options (and on this point, for 15 &pound;/$/&euro; it may well be worth buying 3 so that you can build each and make an extended train.) The second build is a diesel locomotive. This leaves a fair few more parts out but is still quite nice. Though I would argue that it loses some train-iness, and could even be mistaken for a lorry.</p>

<p>The final build is a passenger wagon. Although still fun it leaves out many pieces and feels like it could have done with being elongated just a little bit, though this probably would require an extra clear brick. But for a fiver I don&rsquo;t think anyone could complain. 3 nice builds, perfect if you use lego like I do, that is as a distraction from your work.</p>

<p>And the steam train is awesome. Choo Choo.</p>
