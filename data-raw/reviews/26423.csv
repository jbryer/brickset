<p>Not a fan of cars, but I like green color and it has good assortment of details. It&#39;s hard to spot, but there&#39;re even blue ones and really cool 1x2&nbsp;with&nbsp;ridges. They are hidden behind wheels and if you look directly at them, it&#39;s not a pretty sight &ndash;&nbsp;headlights are hanging out, bizarre patterns are showing, holes and overall messiness.</p>

<p>To me the model seems unfinished, cabin panel has glaring gaps and there&#39;s a single plank instead of a floor. Some studs just beg to be covered with something. And the side of of the&nbsp;front turn signal that&#39;s not supposed to be visible sticks out like a sore thumb.</p>

<p>But from behind the car looks pretty sleek and you can check out the detailed engine.</p>

<p>Building it&nbsp;was&nbsp;a relaxing process and one particular thing &ndash;&nbsp;using pieces with pegs to strengthen&nbsp;the frame &ndash; I found pretty clever.</p>

<p>It&#39;s made in a smaller scale&nbsp;than LEGO System, but minifig still can manage to get behind the wheel.</p>

<p>Overall, nothing to be green about.</p>

"KarolWes","2019-02-10T17:33:27.72Z","Green! Car isn't important","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Car itself looks pretty good. It is simple, nice finished, very well fits into a standard scale city. It is a very classic-looking 8-stud-wide car but for me it&#39;s look has something in it. Though it is creator set, it perfectly fits in with minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Opening part of trunk that reveals engin is a very funny think in that set. Usage of the clear panels in that place make a great work.</p>

<p>In some place, for example at the top of the &quot;door&quot;. But overall it looks brilliant.</p>

<p>But as always in my case the most important are parts in this set. Main reason i bought this set is that it contain a lot of green parts. It is one of the main colors, but it isn&#39;t appears so often. This model has a good amount of small green curved bricks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other very useful parts are the canopy&nbsp;and long technic bricks that make a base of car. And overall amount&nbsp;of pieces in compare to the price looks very inviting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And just like the rest of Creator sets this one has three building inside. Second one is truck that also looks pretty cool. I like the use of steering wheel as a base for a trailer.&nbsp; The mask is designed very nice too. And i like how mirrors are make.&nbsp;This model is in smaller scale the rest of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And last one is funny, crazy looking speedboat also designed in some what of a minifig scale. It looks a little bit poor in compare to the rest but is worth building. Interior isn&#39;t perfect. I like the back view though.</p>

<p>There aren&#39;t any super&nbsp;building technics, just some building on a side, but really simple. The best thing in this set are of course&nbsp;parts. Lot of useful once, in nice colors.&nbsp;And price is good. For me this set really is worth that not so high price. I would recommend it for everyone who loves car or just want to have some green parts in their collection. Over all 4 out of 5 stars!</p>

"Master_Wu","2019-07-18T16:36:13.403Z","Very cool!","<p>I recently got this set at a store on clearence I wanted to say that I&#39;m very happy with it!</p>

<p>This car can hold two minifigures at once! The other two models are a truck, and a boat. I am not a big fan of the truck mainly because you cannot fit a minifigure in it. But the&nbsp;boat is&nbsp;awesome!&nbsp;</p>

<p>These models have some very nice detailing and some nice features. Each of the models have some nice color schemes and look like a very desirable veichle to own. Also, the trunk of the car can open revealing an engine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set also includes some very good technic parts. So, if you want this set to use it for parts, I would also recommend it!</p>

<p>Overall: I would say this set is worth it&#39;s value. It&#39;s fun to build and it includes some very nice parts. I recommend it!</p>
