"CoffeeBrickMan","2017-04-24T13:07:45.583Z","Big Green Monsters","<p>This set immediately caught my eye when the first pictures were revealed for the 2017 sets. It was reminiscent of the 2015 set <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/48694"">31032 Red Creatures</a>&nbsp;which I enjoyed immensely&nbsp;- I bought 2 of those, and acquired parts to build dragons in Black, Blue, Green, White and a Brown/Grey Steampunky version - and this set certainly added to the green parts, and had some interesting design additions.</p>

<p>The primary build is a T.Rex which looks pretty impressive for the piece count. The build starts with the little white bone/rib cage which is a nice enough visual addition, but&nbsp;is not much otherwise. The T.Rex itself is a great little build, the body, legs and tail are in the same basic style as the dragon, although the legs are a little more flexible and I think stable, but the head is a quite different construction, with some excellent snot work which nicely demonstrates the geometries of a couple of the newer additions to the snot brick designs (particularly 22885 &#39;Brick 1X2X1 2/3 W/4 Knobs&#39; and 26604 &#39;Brick 1X1, W/ 2 Knobs, Corner&#39;). The final model is a good size, quite posable, and looks quite fearsome.</p>

<p>The second build is a Triceratops, and visually my favourite of the 3 models. The body, legs and tail are uncomplicated and pretty quick - but again its the head which is the most interesting part of the construction - producing what I feel is a very good looking model, especially since it uses quite a few less parts than the t.rex.</p>

<p>The final build is a Pterodactyl.This uses fewer of the pieces than the Triceratops, and is not the most exciting of builds. It does however produce a quite posable creature. It can&#39;t &#39;stand&#39; on its tiny legs in anything near a flying position as its just not stable - but stand it more upright, like some kind of bird evolved&nbsp;alien species with its wings wrapper around its body - and it looks quite enigmatic.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great set - good parts, and 3 fun builds, producing interesting models - although nothing truly outstanding. Where I think it does excel is in inspiring further creations - a larger triceratops model, an enigmatic alien bird species, and some enhancements to those dragons - particularly in the legs and head.</p>

<p>This s a rather small incarnation of this theme, but the models are well designed for the given size and surprisingly playable.</p>

<p>The look of the Tyrannosaurus is quite detailed, especially the head is a highlight, with some SNOT-magic applied to make it compact and still well-formed. Triceratops has an impressive head too, with a bit of a clunky body, but that dinosaur was, well ... clunky. Pteranodon is quite a beauty as well, and can do dynamic poses.<br />
The looks of all three of them suffer a bit from the big ball joints used to attach their legs ... they give a lot of stability, but don&#39;t fit in well with the body work. It&#39;s a compromise between looks and playability, and as this set is primarily targetted for children, playability is a strong factor here.</p>

<p>Tyrannosaurus Rex definitely is the prime build, defining the parts included in this set and therefore what the other two builds can achieve. It is very very movable with countless hinges and ball joints ... jaw, head, neck, arms, hands, legs, feet, and serveral parts of the tail ... just incredible for such a small model. Besides being movable, it is also very very stable and therefore playable. The only really speical parts needed to achieve this are the joints in his hips ... not really a fan of those as they are quite non-legoish, but i see why they were used. Also not too happy about the technic parts in his feet to attach the claws &ndash; but the rest is rather pure modern lego combined cleverly.</p>

<p>Value for money is great, even on list price, and this set often is/was discounted ... no licenses, no complicated things, lots of good parts in a rather rare colour.</p>

<p>As a bonus, there is an official additional 4th model &ndash; a beautiful Dipodocus / Sauropod, well fitting in.<br />
And if that&#39;s not enough, this set is a great entry into doing MOCs ... if you look at rebrickable, there are many mocs published based on this set alone ... among them a great plesiosaurus, a stegosaurus and a dimetrodon - as well as insects, crabs, scorpions, snakes and a fantastic elefant.</p>

"East64","2019-06-07T18:04:22.157Z","Great for play, display, and parts, home run from lego","<p>I should start by saying that I love dinosaurs, I was totally the dino kid growing up and to this day am still a bit obsessed. So the theme here is fantastic for me.</p>

<p><strong>I have a handful of these 3 in 1 sets and this one has the overall strongest combo of builds</strong>. All three were satisfying to build, even the tertiary model uses the vast majority of parts, all three builds could really stand on their own as sets and that&#39;s the highest compliment you can give to the designer of this set</p>

<p><strong>Pose-ability is fantastic</strong>, the use of ball joints to connect pretty much everything together means that these things can look in all directions and convey movement in all directions. The T-Rex can be looking down roaring at its prey on ground level or looking up as a x-wing flies overhead, however you want to stage these you can.</p>

<p><strong>I like the parts here a lot,</strong> you get a ton of ball joints which I love for animal builds, there aren&#39;t that many specialized parts, there&#39;s a mix of SNOT building for certain parts (you can see that on the head and legs for the T-Rex) and simple vertical building for others like the body and tail segments, it ends up giving you a nice mix of SNOT, plates, and bricks. Green adn tan are nice colors as well that you can never have too much of.</p>

<p><strong>The value here is great</strong> given the price drop, I saw this going for $12 at Target, whether you&#39;re getting this for display, for play, or for parts that&#39;s great value. I&#39;m probably going to buy 2 more so I can stage a dino scene with the full crew!</p>

"DoonsterBuildsLego","2021-04-28T17:18:16.91Z","A well-designed, highly poseable model with good alternative builds","<p>Who doesn&#39;t like a good dinosaur model? Especially one as well-designed and playable as this one.</p>

<p>The construction overall comes together well. There is a nice mix of techniques and parts; the sideways (SNOT) for the head is well done, as is the choice of ball joints through the model. Each of the 3 models is good to build, but my favourite by far is the T Rex. I also like the techniques used so much, I&#39;ve used them as the basis for several creatures since. The final model is quite well balanced, enabling it to stand in a range of poses. The 7+ age range seems reasonable for the building involved.</p>

<p>As with most Creator sets, there is a good mix of generically useful parts in reasonable quantities. The larger ball joints for the hind legs work well for both proportion and posing the model. As is common, there are colour-differentiated parts for the inner parts to aid in construction. I liked the parts so much, I bought an extra set as a parts pack.</p>

<p>This is very playable &mdash; good poseability and lots of function for play for its intended younger audience. Everything holds together well, too, which means quite a low chance of parts coming off during play.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a little pricier than some sets but still represents good value, and can sometimes be found discounted, too.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear to see why this one has lasted so long in the line &mdash; a very nice model that I found good as an adult and kids love, too. It&#39;s also great for picking up as a present for other young Lego fans you might know.</p>

"digi_raptor","2021-03-08T17:46:31.78Z","Great set","<p>I personally love this set as I really like dinosaurs, dragons, reptiles and crocodilians. It&#39;s a great set good for display or play as it has lots of articulation and looks great (all three builds). I built the T. rex as it is the main build, but the other two were both equally well-designed. The building experience was also great. It has a good value for money and can be found at discounts at many stores. The only bad thing is that I wish the wrists/hands could rotate or were on a ball joint.</p>

<p>Overall, definitely recommend this set!</p>
