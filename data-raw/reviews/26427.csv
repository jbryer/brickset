<p>I always enjoy the Creator line because it offers the things I like most about Lego: no stickers, no expensive IP but just a bunch of pieces and ideas. The subject matter of the Creator line is usually not that extravagant: about half of them are either a vehicle or an airplane. The designers at Lego must have designed to mix it up and put two airplanes and a truck in this set.</p>

<h3>Packaging</h3>

<p>The set comes in an attractive box that shows the main build with an airport in the background, along with the traditional 3 in one logo. The secondary and tertiary builds are shown in callouts. Many creator sets feature an illustrated&nbsp;parts list on the side. It&#39;s missing for this particular set, although it is still included in the instructions. Personally, I think that&#39;s a shame. It&#39;s always nice to be able to see the included parts by inspecting the box. There are instructions for all three builds, in separate booklets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set contains a very attractive assortment of pieces. Some tiles, cheese slopes, hinges, SNOT connectors in different colors, all in a sub-&euro;20 set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Like all Creator sets in this price range, this set does not contain any minifigures.</p>

<h3>Main Build</h3>

<p>All vehicles in the main build (and in the alternative builds) consist of little modules. The designers made liberal use of SNOT techniques to attain an impressive amount of detail in each of the three microscale&nbsp;vehicles. The truck looks positively robust and both planes have bright color schemes. Even the semi-trailer uses some interesting techniques.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>The main build consists of everything needed to create an air show: Two airplanes, a truck with semi-trailer and some flags to set up a course. The truck has a detachable semi-trailer. The propeller plane has folding wings and a rotating propeller. The jet plane has no moving parts but is thoroughly swooshable.</p>

<p>The most interesting play feature is not readily apparent when consulting the front of the box: All vehicles consist of three modules which can be detached and re-attached in different ways. The system reminded me of <a href=""http://toysfromthepast.blogspot.nl/2014/10/471-matchbox-connectables-part-1-1989.html"">Matchbox Connectables</a> I had when I was a kid. Most combinations make very little sense, but it&#39;s an original play feature, which is also present two different Creator sets from this wave: the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/31054-1/Blue-Express"">Blue Express</a> and the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/31055-1/Red-Racer"">Red Racer</a>.</p>

<h3>Other builds</h3>

<p>The other builds are a 5-axle crane and a drag race with two very dissimilar vehicles. The 5 axle crane looks a bit like a microscale version of the venerable <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42009-1/mobile-crane-mk-ii"">42009 Mobile Crane XL</a>&nbsp;with a rotating superstructure and boom which can be raised. Frankly, the drag race is not that inspired. Both alternate builds leave quite some pieces unused so there is an open challenge to create a C-build that makes more efficient use of the rich part selection of this set. All the other builds use the same module system as the main build.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I love the Creator line and this set epitomizes why: A lot of nice parts and some ideas, that&#39;s all that any AFOL really needs.</p>
