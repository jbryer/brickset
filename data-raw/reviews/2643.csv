Its just big enough &amp; has a good balance of parts so you can build many things, its not like the parts force you only to build houses....

I still have the pieces of this &amp; instructions packed away, and I take it camping for the kids to play with.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Widdi","2007-03-26T09:33:36.073Z","Another ckassic from my early childhood","This is a great little Basic set. Got this with 515 way back in 1992, around my 4th birthday. The set builds many different models and comes with an minifigure. You can build anything you want just with the pieces of this set. Buses, furniture, sculptures and even a boat and houses. It only lacks a proper steering wheel, but that can be easily fixed if you have some city sets from the era, too. Unfortunately It seems that I have lost my instructions for it, but I still have the pieces scattered in my collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I really enjoyed creating my own mini structures and having fun with it as a child. A very good set for young children playing with lego for the 1st time.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
