On my own opinion it doesn&#39;t need to be larger. it stay a cabin and also a fishing and rest spot. as i can its not something that you can use as real house, but as&nbsp;additional part of a real one. its very easy and quick to build. nothing special or complicated. the price is correct but i wouldn&#39;t paid&nbsp;much for it because even if it&#39;s look lovely the amount of pieces is not that big and you could easily designed this alone with condition that you have enough parts for it.</p>
