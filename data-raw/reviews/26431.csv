"SqdnCmndrAceFlshrt","2017-02-23T00:03:59.08Z","A good solid Flying Boat...","<p>This is a three in one kit, but I&#39;ve only built the one model so far, because it was the large brightly coloured&nbsp;Flying Boat that caught my attention! &nbsp;Bought as I wasn&#39;t well and wanted something to make me feel better. &nbsp;And the toy shop was selling it with&nbsp;20% off.</p>

<p>This particular build consists of the Aircraft itself, a little desert island, a brick built parrot, and a minifig with a pile of equipment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Aircraft is a nicely weighty and solid construction. If it has a fault it is a slightly over engineered- the fuselage is mostly solid except for the cockpit and a small storage area at the back. &nbsp;I was hoping for more of a cabin. The rest is packed with all the spare light sand and light blue coloured plates required in the other builds (one of which is a sort of beach house affair, so they&#39;re needed there.) and the array that holds the main wing on. I suppose as this is a creator set rather than a play set there is more emphasis on the build and structure than there is on the playability within the model. &nbsp;Oddly, whilst the main wing is very firmly attached the tail horizontal stabaliser isn&#39;t - only one technic piece connects the three sections to the two tail booms and as a result they end up at all sorts of angles when the model is handled. I find the model very nice from the front, but the fuselage is a little short and stubby. Also it appears to be a waterline model- i.e they don&#39;t complete the bottom of the hull properly, and its simply a row of brown flat plates</p>

<p>I can&#39;t comment on the rarity or type of the bricks involved, but I liked the nice dark blue hull parts as they are a colour I havn&#39;t encountered often, and double as the hull for one of the other builds ( the fishing boat/cruiser) . Not many moving parts- The Propellers don&#39;t really spin freely,&nbsp;theres a hatch at the back, one on top for the cockpit and thats&nbsp;yer lot.</p>

<p>I suppose it would simple enough to redesign the interior to create some more cabin space, but so far I have been content to simply fly it round the room making &quot;Yeeeooowwm!&quot; noises!</p>

<p>The island is simpley&nbsp;a handful of sand and light blue coloured pieces, &nbsp;with a pair of trees. The trees are odd. They are neither firmly attached nor rigid. &nbsp;They spin round rather more freely than the flying boats propellers! &nbsp;I suppose its just something to with the spare parts needed in the other builds.</p>

<p>I quite liked the little parrot. &nbsp;He&#39;s only 5 small parts, and the result is a sort of low resolution brightly coloured bird.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifig&nbsp;gets two faces to his head; A mustached visage on one side to represent the slick and stylish aviator of the 1930s, exploring the remote corners of the world. &nbsp;The other a more bearded rugged look for when he&#39;s been marooned on a desert island living in a house made out of bits of crashed aircraft for too long.</p>

<p>He gets a choice of hair, or a good old fashioned aviators cap with goggles, a part I hadn&#39;t seen before. He is equipped with an old map ( the same one as used to be in the old Pirate sets) , pick and shovel, and for refreshment,&nbsp;a mug and wine bottle. Just the thing for hanging around tropical islands. Presumably he is on the hunt for buried treasure, lost civilizations, or somewhere to have a quiet drink.</p>

<p>Theres also a fish. Unlike the parrot its not brick built , which seemed like a cop out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I enjoyed the build which took around 25 minutes, and I like the finished model, with its reassuring weight, and bright colours, and feel it was well worth the &pound;15.99 I paid for it which worked out at a mere 5p a brick. &nbsp;Now, I&#39;m off to fly it round the room again....</p>

"Cameron_Talley","2017-02-26T04:27:21.693Z","The Seaduck","<p>This set is great for one reason--the plane appears to be based on The Seaduck, the plane from Disney&#39;s TaleSpin&nbsp;animated series. Really the only difference is the color scheme and the wings being flat on the front instead of sweeping backwards (easily changeable by flipping the outside wing pieces around).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I thought there here was a great selection of parts in this set, and it&#39;s a great way to get some yellow bricks! &nbsp;Overall a fun set and a must for Disney TaleSpin fans!</p>

<p>Very well done set and highly recommended.&nbsp;</p>

"Hashem1983","2017-09-04T17:55:35.38Z","I had the Most Exciting Building Experience","<p>When I first saw the picture of this set before its been released, I wasn&#39;t that fascinated, but when I saw the You Tube reviews and the pictures I change my mind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Box and Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>The Box size is quite modest, and since this is a 3 in 1&nbsp;Creator set, it has a main build and 2 primary build, and in that case the plane is the main build that its displayed on the front flying above the sea and there is a little buildable island with palm trees as if it look far away from the plane, of course the other 2 models are displayed on the front in a smaller size.</p>

<p>On the back, you get a good close look of the 3 different designs and all of its features.</p>

<p>It comes with 3 instructions booklet, and I got to say I was surprised when I saw that they were sealed in a plastic wrap and not just thrown inside, and made it look like one solid thing. It was easy to follow and had a smooth build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Parts:</strong></p>

<p>It has a nice parts collection in terms of plates, sloped and curved plates and some clips, you get lots of yellow bricks and lots of white bricks as well. The dark blue are the slope and the big curved&nbsp;pieces, which I liked, with the 2 turbine. There is also few small amount of Technic pieces in Brown, which made it special to me, yet there are some of Reds, Browns, Aqua Blue Plates and Grey Parts.</p>

<p>There are also a Shovel, Pickaxe, a Bottle, a red mug, a fish and a printed map like the ones in the 2015 Pirates, only this time its not printed on a white 2x2 flat plate, but a 2x2 flat light tan plate.</p>

<p>All in All, Very good amount of parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifiguers:</strong></p>

<p>You only get one figure in this set, and it is a very nice figure, he wears a red shirt with double prints front and back, and a sand blue legs, no prints on it. As for the face he has double prints. A shaved looking face with a mustache in brown, the other is a thick scruffy beard, which I liked most, it kinda makes you feel that this guy is lost in an island and surviving or maybe you could create you own scenario. He is also given a Pilot helmet with goggles on it and you can take it off and put a hair on him that comes in dark brown. Now about the hair piece, this isn&#39;t the first time I get this hair piece, but in this one, it keeps disconnected from the head so easily, so I tried to compare it with one of the old hair pieces that is similar to it, and the molding from the inside is different.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>Even if I have a favorite model, I still love to build all three models to experience the building techniques, starting with the main model:</p>

<p><strong>The plane:</strong> You get to build the body first, and it has a wonderful technique so you add the dark blue slope pieces with the curved ones to make it look like the hull of the plane, the cockpit roof is opened with hinge clips. There is an opening on the back of the plane where you store your items, its not that big, but its enough for the pickaxe and the shovel. The wings however, was surprisingly brilliant, most Lego jets or plane wings are built up with plates mostly, but this one, it did rely on bricks and some of the 1x(whatever the number is) plates, in some areas it used the 2X4, and some of the 1x1 clip pieces for a reason, its clipping or connecting each part of the wings and tales, and the turbine engines are not so bad designed as well. Then you get to build the small island with two small palm trees and a tiny parrot. My only Problem with the palm trees were after you take off the pieces, I had a hard time removing the blue technic pins from the angled Technic piece, I did not want to use force because I didn&#39;t want to damage anything in it, in the end I used my teeth to remove them.</p>

<p><strong>The Boat:</strong>&nbsp;This is the smallest build. The hull has almost the same technic build like the plane with few changes of course, this time there is a storage area in front that is covered with a hinge mechanism opening. On the rear bottom, there are 3 cylinder pieces that are used as mini engine, the deck part is designed very well, with nice details on the sides.</p>

<p><strong>The Hut:</strong> This is my favorite build of the three, you start building the base using the 2X4 aqua blue plates&nbsp;with the light tan plates, then you start building the base for the hut and all the way up where you build the bed and a nice shade on top of it using the 2 curved piece. You also get to build a nice grilling station, a side shade on the ground and wind turbine with controls. There is also a buildable palm tree using the 2 angle Technic pieces, a little suggestion, you don&#39;t have to build it as it is in the instruction, just change the direction of one of the technic brown pieces and it will give you a different kind of shape. In General, you do sometimes feel like its been built from the plane leftovers after it crashed.</p>

<p>The buildable parrot in this set have the same build in all three models.</p>

<p><strong>The Complete Model:</strong></p>

<p>You can sense that there is a scenario going around in this set, its starts with the propeller plane, going down to the deserted island and finally you evacuate it with a boat. I have nothing against the 3 models, I loved them all, but I fell in love with the hut much more.</p>

<p>The plane looked wonderful and its well closed, no gaps. The hull looks beautiful without using special hull pieces. As I said, the roof for the cockpit&nbsp;opens smoothly, there&#39;s a storage area on the back that opens to place the accessories, the propellers does not rotate that much unless you give a little space between the small round technic piece and the brick on the brown axle, and the Tale rotates up and down.</p>

<p>The boat is the smallest of them all, yet it looks nice and could be used in your Lego city.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hut doesn&#39;t have to be like its been on a deserted island, but I feel that it could be used as a nice booth on the beach. The inside of the hut there is a buildable table with the map on it and a gas lantern on the left side. On the right one, there&#39;s a hanger where you place the pilot helmet on it that keeps falling off and hard to put it back on, a mini shelf on the wall and a small window.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a buildable ladder that takes you to the top where is the bedroom that contains nothing but a cozy bed and a small lantern.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>I actually after building the plane, did not want to take it a part just yet, but I was so anxious to start with the other 2.</p>

<p>Each three models are wonderful despite some issues that you might face, nothing is perfect, but in general to make a point, if you are building the plane, just make sure if you want to take it off, to take it off carefully, since the wings build are connected&nbsp;to each other using clips, and sometimes those clips get to break that easily, not that it happened with me here, but it could, removing the blue technic pins from the palm trees was horrible, I felt like it was going to be stuck in it forever, the hair piece that keeps taking off the head.</p>

<p>Despite the negative parts that I had with this set, it is still a wonderful set and highly recomend it, I am even thining about buying another one, as I did like all three models.&nbsp;</p>
