"MrJackson","2017-01-20T18:48:12.28Z","A good boost for your fledgling city","<p>The Park Street Townhouse is Lego&#39;s first 3-in-one building offering for 2017. &nbsp;It continues a long tradition of 3-in-1 structures, and is preceded by last year&#39;s excellent Corner Deli. &nbsp;Let&#39;s dive in and see how it compares.</p>

<p>The primary build is a medium-sized townhouse. &nbsp;Comprised of 3 levels, it is 14 studs wide, with the option to attach an area of greenery that includes a tree and small outdoor bench. &nbsp;There are actually two locations you can do that. &nbsp;The build for the townhouse begins with dark red for the first level or two of bricks, and then moves to tan for the right half (if it is opened; it&#39;s the back half closed) and a mix of tan and the always lovely and never common enough sand green for the left half. The lowest level is a few bricks high and contains a flatscreen tv and couch for your minifigure. &nbsp;However, there is no stair access on the inside to either the basement of second floor. The left side of the building has the front steps and front door, which are detailed using the new ball with 3.18 rod element that first appeared as a Nexo Knights projectile. &nbsp;The build moves on to the bay windows, which are executed with the boat windows rather effectively. &nbsp; The rooftop terrace with plants is then constructed, followed by an effectively rendered fire escape. &nbsp;Last to be built is the grassy area. &nbsp; It is an&nbsp;overall fairly basic build with no interesting half-stud offsets or anything of that ilk, but it is a solid residential structure and there doesn&#39;t seem to be too many of those. &nbsp;One thing that I want to stress as a major advantage is that the building is 14 studs wide when it is hinged closed, which leaves you space to fit two of them side by side on a 32x32 baseplate as the space taken up by the curve of the hinge brick doesn&#39;t preclude two sets both fitting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second build is a small cafe. &nbsp;The main structure is assembled, but has a rather spartan interior. &nbsp;To be fair, though, there was not a whole lot of detail inside the Corner Deli, either. &nbsp;The outdoor eating area is built next, and I liked the repurposing of the fire escape pieces as a framework that climbing plants cover. &nbsp;There are some neat techniques used to make the angled&nbsp;sign, including a Mixel plate and towball connection which is surprisingly snug and firm. &nbsp;This build has a rooftop garden which is enclosed by on of the 1x4x5 windows from the main build. There is an enclosed archway for the gentleman to park his Vespa.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The third build is a small house with a fairly substantial greenhouse, that makes excellent use of the big bay window pieces. &nbsp;In fact it almost seems like the greenhouse was the priority here, as it occupies a large percentage of both pieces and construction steps. &nbsp;There isn&#39;t much to talk about regarding the house itself: there aren&#39;t steps to the upper levels (though, that&#39;s the case with the other two builds as well), and frustratingly, there isn&#39;t a back. &nbsp;This build is akin to the older sets which had open backs for playability purposes; the problem is, there&#39;s not much to really do when it comes to playing with this build. &nbsp; Additionally, there are quite a few pieces left unused, which I feel could have been better appropriated and worked into the build.<br />
<br />
That&#39;s the overview of the 3 builds. &nbsp;They definitely feel like primary, secondary, and tertiary builds, which is a common issue with the 3-in-1&nbsp;buildings. &nbsp;Contrast that with last year&#39;s Vacation Getaways, which has three excellent builds, and I feel like something was maybe missing from the last official build option.</p>

<p>This is also a rather good parts pack, with tan, sand green, and dark red bricks, a medium blue door, and the new ball piece, of which there are around 10 of. It also has the boat windows and a red Vespa. The builds are decent-to-strong on their own rights, and I already have all three builds fleshing out my city, and actually have two (soon to be four) of the townhouses as they do lend themselves well to forming a row of houses.</p>

<p>It&#39;s listed at $49.99 which I think is a decent price for the part count and what those parts actually are. &nbsp;These sets usually get discounted at some point or another, so I would definitely recomment snagging it, especially if you see it on sale. &nbsp;This is an excellent supplemental set that will do well to expand your city.</p>

In the primary model, the curve windows and layered build provide a nice facade to the street. This model is so tempting for me to make it&nbsp;into a complete building &nbsp;</p>

<p>The alternate builds, however, are not worth building. They can not compare to the primary model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts are perfect! Nice colors, many windows, doors, and so on. I&rsquo;ll buy more if I see them on discounts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only problem: Price wise, it is very expensive in Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
