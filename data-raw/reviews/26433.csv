By tiny though I&rsquo;m not referring to the size of the models, but actually the size of the box, it&rsquo;s much smaller than I expected, does a good job of taking up less shelf space though.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Anyway, this is another of the new DC Super Hero Girls sets and it&rsquo;s the first set featuring Batgirl from that Theme. Is it worth getting if you&rsquo;re not interested in getting every set from the Theme? Let&rsquo;s go over the high points and the low points and we&rsquo;ll discover that together.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Box: As I noted above this box is much smaller than I expected. The design is the same style as the DC Super Hero Girls sets I&rsquo;ve reviewed already. This set however is in a box that is the same size as the 25$ sets and yet they are asking 35$ for it, a ten dollar difference despite the piece count not being much higher than the Dorm Room set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: The instructions are what you&rsquo;d expect, they use the modular approach as this set includes numbered bags. They also have some great checklist and cross-sell images in the back, the checklist is for the entire first wave and the other image shows how two of the sets can be connected to one another and expand on the Super Hero School.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">All of the details seem to be relegated to stickers again, this small box design fails because the stickers were curled when I opened the box. A constant problem when dealing with LEGO sticker sheets.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">An ok selection of parts in this set, not as diverse as LEGO Friends, but quite enjoyable. The large wing parts and the two wing pieces are in a nice dark blue colour and there&rsquo;s some purple elements including one of the large net launchers. There are seven of the new half-watermelon parts in black and a nice printed cell phone for Batgirl.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Batgirl: This mini-doll looks great, the print really grabs me. It&rsquo;s a very unusual and unique look for the character, she&rsquo;s got a hoodie hair piece with two small bat-ears sticking out and a nice hair style poking out from within it. The wings are tiny gargoyle-like in design and made in a softer plastic flexible for attaching to the Mini-Doll frame.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Her accessory is a printed IPhone which has been stolen from her by the Kryptomite, she has no other accessories, no Batarangs, nothing else really. You do get a spare cape though for another mini-doll to use.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Kryptomite: This one is built with yellow pieces, a fun looking creature. I have no idea what effect yellow kryptonite has, however I do know that this Kryptomite is a real threat to Supergirl, so having Batgirl face it down works.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The build</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 1: This is a bit of a disappointing build, mostly because there&rsquo;s very little to build in this bag, you&rsquo;ll find Batgirl, the Kryptomite and a small ATV style vehicle for said Kryptomite to drive. The more interesting build in my opinion is in the next bag.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 2: The Batjet is a solid looking build, the biggest flaw in this construction is that all of the detailing is stickers and the stickers need to be applied just right, which can be tricky for younger builders. I suspect this is why the suggested starting age for this set is 7 compared to 5. Really great build though aside from that, nothing struck me as difficult or frustrating while building it&hellip; granted I am an AFOL so some dexterity issues may be present that I wouldn&rsquo;t catch at this point.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Batjet: This model is solid, it&rsquo;s a really fun build and it&rsquo;s fun to play with once it&rsquo;s completed. There is however a minor issue I have with it, the LEGO Net launcher play feature really stands out when the net is crammed into the launcher. It doesn&rsquo;t seem to have enough space for it, which means it&rsquo;ll probably be lost easily. There are a pair of stud launchers on this vehicle that work out much better.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The biggest problem with this model aside from the net launcher is the massive number of stickers for the detailing, there is way too many stickers, a few printed elements would have been much better appreciated for this model. That being said it looks pretty awesome, it&rsquo;s got a nice colour scheme too with a load of black broken up by LEGO Friends style dark and light purple colouring and the dark blue elements, it&rsquo;s just a very nice looking model that I really think it&rsquo;s good value.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">ATV: This little model was a bit of a disappointment because it was built too fast, but it&rsquo;s a great little model. The Kryptomite is somehow driving it and he (or she) sits quite awkwardly attached to the handlebar. There&rsquo;s no place for any other character to fit though, so you&rsquo;re only going to find that a Kryptomite could drive it. Fun little model, good inclusion for this set.</span></span></span></span></p>

Overall I&rsquo;d definitely recommend it, if you can get it on discount, I&rsquo;m not impressed with the 35$ original asking price, the models are slightly smaller than you&rsquo;d expect and I think the only reason this set was not the same price as the Dorm Room from wave one, is all because it features larger elements. Still I&rsquo;d recommend this set, despite the price issues.</span></span></span></span></p>
