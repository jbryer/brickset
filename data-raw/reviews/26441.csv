I have wanted to get them for the sake of picking them up to add to my collection, but it hasn&rsquo;t been easy. This is a pretty decent set for the price-point, though it isn&rsquo;t tied much into the film that much. Which isn&rsquo;t a bad thing, anyway, let&rsquo;s explore this set in further detail.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Box: LEGO Disney evolved from Disney Princess, but the Theme is pretty much the same as the past. However they seem to have changed the colours of the boxes from year to year, I recall we&rsquo;ve had pink and purple boxes and in 2017 we get teal or aqua looking boxes. This one features a brilliant snow motif for Frozen and shows Anna in the bottom corner.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: It&rsquo;s another modular build with two numbered bags breaking up the number of pages in the manual, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ve ever mentioned that before in my reviews, but LEGO uses the modular design almost as page breaks or chapter titles when creating the manuals so you know when you&rsquo;ve started and stopped with each build. This design is fairly useful, the back also shows the other sets in the wave and all of the Mini-Doll lines being offered by LEGO during this time period.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The parts in this set are fairly standard, not as many unique colours or pieces here, there is a great new piece which is an x or cross shaped element which I haven&rsquo;t seen yet in any other set that I&rsquo;ve picked up just yet. There are so many fun possibilities with such a piece, I hope to see it used many more times.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Anna: Here we have a very cute looking Mini-Doll. Anna is dressed in her traditional Arendelle dress with a cloth cloak which fits around the Mini-Doll&rsquo;s neck. For accessories she gets a printed tile with a chocolate bar, a map which I believe originally started out as a LEGO Pirates treasure map, she must be out looking for something.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Included with this set is a large Horse, Anna&rsquo;s Horse, which is a nice looking animal, but it doesn&rsquo;t include a saddle element for Anna to ride so I&rsquo;m a bit curious as to why they included it without the saddle for Anna to ride on.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The build</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 1: You&rsquo;ll find Anna in her lovely dress in this set along with her horse and a small water trough and hay feeding side-building for the horse. This build is quite minimalistic without any big issues or problems. There&rsquo;s some nice elements for this build as well, the hanging icicle being a particular fun part of the detail work. Using clear 1x2 tiles on the roof for more ice effects is also a nice contrast with the teal roof elements.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 2: This build is focused on the larger model which features a sleeping area in a small barn where Anna can rest for the evening. This build was equally fun with very little aspect that would trip up younger builders. The angling of the roof is a very classically done build by this point, but still a fun evolution how angled roofs used to be built in LEGO form. I remember those awkward looking sloped elements and the plates that were used when I built Majisto&rsquo;s Workshop, the new clip joints and attachment parts really help achieve the look far sturdier than anything I used to build.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">If I&rsquo;m not mistaken this is meant to represent a scene from the movie, I could be off on that, but honestly it doesn&rsquo;t strike me as having actually happened this way.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">But anyway here&rsquo;s where we find all of the builds combined into a very nice looking little scene, Anna and her horse have this little ice and snow covered campsite with a small fire off to one side being used to melt some chocolate. The horse has a nice place with some hay and water to stand by while Anna has a nice little covered bed where she can rest from the elements.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Both have some nice icicle effects, while the larger model uses some jewels for ice effects which adds to the look of the set quite nicely. I like the overall look of this model, it&rsquo;s a very nice subdued looking set, the colouring fits the Frozen world quite nicely. I definitely think this is one of the better offerings from Disney&rsquo;s Princess line, even if it isn&rsquo;t from the actual movie. The models have a lot of charm and will be great fun for fans to play with.</span></span></span></span></p>

I&rsquo;m also pleased to see that this set is one of the cheaper offerings for getting Anna. I strongly suggest tracking it down if you can still find it at retail and adding it to your Disney Princess collection.</span></span></span></span></p>
