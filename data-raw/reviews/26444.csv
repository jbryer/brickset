<p>We like the story so much we sometimes re-enact it with our lego sets with the movie soundtrack playing on my laptop.&nbsp; For us there is tons of playability here.</p>

<p>Wish there was a Kakamora ship set though and the land of monsters.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-30T23:02:45.35Z","You're Welcome!","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #41150 Moana&rsquo;s Ocean Voyage:</b> A set from 2017 which is extremely difficult to find, this little gem includes many elements from the hit film Moana, there were two sets made for this film in the Disney Theme and this was the larger and more expensive of the two.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">How far will you go with Moana and Maui as you journey across the ocean to restore the Heart of Te Fiti? Will Moana meet Elsa and Anna? Snow White? Cinderella or Jasmine? It&rsquo;s all up to you when you build and have adventures with this impressive set from LEGO Disney.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Sounds like a good marketing description, doesn&rsquo;t it? This set is pretty impressive, and this review may contain spoilers for the film, so if you have not yet seen it I would suggest not reading any further. You have been warned.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The LEGO Disney Princess line became the LEGO Disney line by the time 2017 came along, so each package now has LEGO Disney prominently at the top. The image on the front showcases the set and all of the models and characters included in the set. The back shows off the set along with animation shots from the actual movie, the sparkly magical pixie dust, or Disney magic sparkles are seen all over the box as well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual for this set is fairly thick and features step-by-step build instructions for each numbered bag in the model. Included in this set is a sticker sheet for added detailing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There are a few stand out parts in this set, though not many, as most of the elements are standard for LEGO Disney Princess or Disney, whichever you prefer. There&rsquo;s a nice printed tile element showing Maui&rsquo;s constellation in the heavens and a few Kakamora printed Minifigure heads which are pretty cute, but overall as I stated about regular bricks, plant elements, tiles and ship parts. Speaking of which, Moana has a nice large sail piece too.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Mini-Dolls</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Maui: This is a first, a Big Fig in a Mini-Doll set. Maui is a solid looking character and with his bulky design this Big Fig body does him justice. He is not as large as he could have been, but he does look great. His hook is also included made out of white elements, it&rsquo;s enchanted and looks very nice. All of the tattoos are included with printed detailing on his arms and torso.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Moana: I love Moana in this set, she looks great, and is actually a bare footed Disney Princess. Unfortunately the Mini-Doll has sculpted shoes on the feet, it would have been nice if LEGO chose to print toes on her, but for some reason they didn&rsquo;t, which slightly makes Moana look pretty goofy with plain skin-tone shoes on her feet. She has a flower to put in her hair, a banana to store in her boat and overall really looks good aside from the feet.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Te Fiti: I included this here simply to discuss that the character is included as part of the model of the island which is made during the build. Te Fiti is a named character and included, but her model is a very tiny one and honestly seems to be a bit of a letdown.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Heihei: It&rsquo;s a chicken, a rooster to be precise. It&rsquo;s really quite a good new animal piece with some great printing on it to match the character from the film. Great addition to the set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kakamora: A pair of printed regular Minifigure heads with additional plant elements attached to the top, the Kakamora are after the Heart of Te Fiti and only Moana can stop them, with the help of Maui. These aren&rsquo;t really Minifigures or Mini-Dolls, but they are characters included in the set and pretty cleverly made.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Moana and her chicken friend Heihei start working building their ship with this bag. It&rsquo;s a pretty quick build as it is only half of the ship, one sticker is used for detailing. Nothing much else to discuss, easy to follow along and only one sticker means it won&rsquo;t take long to finish it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Maui and the Kakamora team up to build the rest of Moana&rsquo;s ship, the Kakamora raft and a section of Te Fiti&rsquo;s island. Each model worked on is a quick and efficiently constructed model, I mean there aren&rsquo;t really any problems here, also of note there are no other stickers to apply during this build. The sail attaches a certain way, this is the only difficult step in the building process because it will not work if you put it on incorrectly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: This final build finishes off Te Fiti&rsquo;s island, which is definitely not to scale with the character as seen in the movie. But it does an effective job of bringing the character to life in LEGO form. The trees are fun to build, and the island itself is a real treat, but stickers need to be applied appropriately for Te Fiti&rsquo;s face. And the other. Return the Heart to Te Fiti and save the Islands.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Moana&rsquo;s Boat: This is a solid model. Really impressive, and really looks like the animation model complete with food storage compartment, Te Fiti&rsquo;s symbol printed sail. The size may be a bit off, it is hard to find a place for Maui and Moana, but they do both sit on the boat. Or stand as the case is. Most of the details are from stickers.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kakamora Raft: This thing is tiny, it is nothing like what was in the actual movie. Instead we have a tiny little raft with two Kakamora and a catapult, the catapult lets you launch the Kakamora at Moana&rsquo;s boat so they can board and steal the Heart.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Te Fiti&rsquo;s Island: This model is where the last of the play features is located, you get to build Te Fiti and Te Ka together, they sit on a spinning plate. Insert the Heart into a slot on the Island and you can change Te Ka restoring her to her true form of Te Fiti. It&rsquo;s a very impressive little model, but the key word here is little, Te Fiti and Te Ka were massive. A slightly larger model may have worked batter, or at least a taller model so she is taller than the trees on the island.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Moana is a very enjoyable film, I really enjoyed it when I first saw it and really liked how LEGO introduced it into the Disney Princess line. This set is a bit everywhere, it features a lot of elements from the story of the film, but feels slightly disjointed. Te Fiti is somewhat tiny, the Kakamora ship is way too small which means the adventure aspect of the story is not captured as well as it could have been. It is a nice set though and I would recommend it, if you can still find it anywhere. It is surprisingly quick for Disney sets to vanish from Retail, even before they Retire. Recommended.</p>
