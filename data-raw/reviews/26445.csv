<p>I love the gold pieces used as one of the accent colours and the majestic gold price on the tail of the gondala.</p>

<p>I this set would probably be my favourite set of the line if it included and animal companion for Naida.</p>

This year introduces an entirely new element where the Elves must rescue Emily&rsquo;s sister from the Goblin King and his mischievous looking little Goblins. It&rsquo;s an interesting concept and many of the sets are very fun looking, this is the cheapest offer from this wave and possibly one of the best sets to get outside the largest ones.</span></span></span></span></p>

However a new piece of artwork was included showing the Elves and Emily preparing to use their magic against the Goblin King who has Emily&rsquo;s sister in a cage behind him. The back shows even more, with some great artwork of the Goblins, the Elves and everything else, plus of course the set and its features. Overall a really impressive box design.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s a good manual that serves well.</span></span></span></span></p>

For accessories she includes jewels, a single smooth blue stud to represent her magic and another one for a compass, as well as a printed tile with a map showing how to reach the Goblin King&rsquo;s hideout where he&rsquo;s stashed Emily&rsquo;s little sister. She looks great and I&rsquo;m pleased to finally add her to my collection.</span></span></span></span></p>

He also a chicken leg for a quick meal while he&rsquo;s waiting for the Elf to show up in her Gondola.</span></span></span></span></p>

It was fast, uncomplicated and relatively enjoyable with no tricky or troublesome parts for younger builders. This is because sets of this size are designed for quick pick-up-and-play fun and they rarely disappoint, the Gondola model was a very enjoyable bit of fun, and the small Goblin Outpost looks great and was a treat to build.</span></span></span></span></p>

He also includes a catapult that launches&hellip; flowers? Ummm, I suppose that might upset Naida, but I don&rsquo;t see how it could sink her boat or hurt her in any meaningful way. Still, it could be worse I suppose.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s got some really nice mini-dolls and features a lot of fun playability. On top of that there&rsquo;s some nice printed elements in the set and everything can be used to have fun with a little story involving the search for Emily Jones&rsquo; little sister.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Lonewolf5529","2018-06-01T14:50:11.087Z","Small, but not bad","<p>So, this will be my first review.&nbsp; Just getting back into LEGO - I had a bunch as a kid, but gave them all away to a friend&#39;s kid when I was in my 20s.&nbsp; Started buying again recently because I couldn&#39;t resist the Elves sets anymore.<br />
<br />
But about the set.&nbsp; &nbsp;So this is kinda smallish, with not much to build.&nbsp; Still I&#39;m digging the Elves figures and Naida is no exception.&nbsp; Love the elemental theme with them.&nbsp; Naida, clearly the water elf here, is taking treasure down the river and is waylaid by the goblin.&nbsp; I love the little details, like the goblin having a little plaque with instructions.&nbsp; And his little snack while he keeps watch with the telescope.&nbsp; Naida&#39;s compass and magic lantern are also nice touches.<br />
<br />
Compared to other Elves sets I got, not many moving parts here, just the back of the ship (some kind of magical rudder, I guess) and the goblin&#39;s little catapult.<br />
<br />
From the listings here, this appears to be early in the lineup for 2017, so it would not have been clear what the little purple flowers were supposed to do as ammo.&nbsp; Of course in later sets we find out that is the nascent form of the carnivorous plants that the goblins are so fond of.<br />
<br />
Overall, a nice, if smallish, set and a good intro to the Elves line.</p>
