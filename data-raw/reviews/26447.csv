You see I collect brick dragons, of both the lego variety and others... But enough of imaginary things - Onwards, to the dragon!</p>

<p>So the set consists of two main elements: The eeeeeevil dragon and a cavern of sorts. As I&#39;ve understood the plot here the Goblin King covets the crystal housed in the cavern of the peaceful bears. However being a goblin king means you don&#39;t care about cuddly bears and you&#39;d gladly blow their cave up. Said and done, the King sends one of his minions to perform the foul deed and retrieve the crystal.</p>

<p>The set has only two minifigs:&nbsp;The Goblin King and the goblin Jimblin. None of them are of the ordinary lego minifig size since this after all is a Friends off-themed set. The King is a Friends type fig and Jimblin is a one-piece mold with movable arms. The figs, while not the focus of the set, are good. I&#39;m normally not into the friends styled figs but the King has a certain charm to him! This is also the only set featuring The king, so bear that in mind. The goblin is a funny sidekick but also limited due to the one-piece mold. Also making an appearence are two fantasy styled bears, whereof the cub can be stolen away by the King using his magical prison.</p>

<p>Now then, before I move on to the main event, lets look at the bricks. There&#39;s not a lot of unique bricks here apart from the dragons head and wings. If you&#39;re like me you&#39;re dreading the sticker sheet. However there is no need for alarm as there&#39;s only four stickers included and they&#39;re all easily placed.</p>

<p>Enough is enough! The time is nigh - Enter the dragon! The goblin kings mighty steed is just as vicious as her evil master. Speaking of, I&#39;m not sure if the dragon is male or female, but there&#39;s a certain feminine theme of all dragons in the elves theme. With that in mind I&#39;m going with that this lime yellow flying reptile is also a &quot;her&quot;.</p>

<p>Anyway as a dragon collector I&#39;m happy to report that this is a good one! Although the posability is a bit wonky I must say. You see the dragons hindlegs are not built with a stop-hinge design which means that balance is an issue. However it&#39;s more often than not fixable via the stop-hinge feet.</p>

<p>Apart from these issues the posability is quite nice. Of course I&#39;d love to see more points of articulation&nbsp;but for a non-premium lego design it&#39;s still good. In fact compared to the latest face-printed dragons of 2013 and &#39;14 - The posability is very much improved.</p>

<p>So because of the lack of minifigs and surrounding build aspects, this comes in at a very resonable price. Here in Sweden I picked it up for rougly the equivilant of 30,8&nbsp;USD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So all in all you get a nice little set with few figures but a dragon that makes up f&ouml;r it. If you&#39;re looking to expand your medieval themed display with another dragon or looking to get your first dragon this is a set I can recommend.</p>

"Arcanelexicon77","2018-05-16T06:24:10.817Z","Looking forward to more evil dragons/creatures","<p>Looking at the various&nbsp;Elves sets, it seemed that the villains always came in the bigger, more expensive sets. This set bucks the trend and gives us not only the Goblin King, but his ride as well, Ashwing.</p>

<p>Building the Dragon:</p>

<p>The build was pretty fun and the end result is pretty striking. A good combination of red &amp; pink gaves good coloration to the dragon. Unlike the others, this dragon does not have front legs (which would make it a wyvern) but the way they made it still makes it look menacing and unique. The black pieces on the horns and claws add to the overall &lsquo;evilness&rsquo; of the design&nbsp;. The only problem with the build would be the wings as they do not stretch out fully. As for the dragon&rsquo;s size, it&rsquo;s almost the same or slightly bigger than the fire/wind dragon.</p>

<p>Building the cave and cage:</p>

<p>The cave has a fun play element where if you push the dynamite in, it pops off the blue crystals that hides the &lsquo;evil&rsquo; green crystal. The brick built cage is also visually striking thanks to the claws that makes up its bars, and it has enough space to place either li&rsquo;l blue (the baby polar bear), or the green crystal.</p>

<p>The figures:</p>

<p>The Goblin King comes with a cape and scepter and I do hope that they can come up with more evil faces aside from the usual scowl (one doing an evil laugh would be awesome). The goblin has a cute/menacing look and makes an ok&nbsp;minion. The bears are pretty good but i wish that the mommy bear would be a little bigger.</p>

<p>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Overall, I would highly recommend this set and the main reason why would be that the dragon looks menacing and is strikingly different compared to the good dragons who look more cute and noble</p>

"Lonewolf5529","2018-06-04T19:54:28.243Z","Why do bad guys get all the cool stuff?","<p>So this was was pretty fun to build and is a fairly awesome dragon (or as my fantasy nerd friend pointed out, wyvern [since it has no forelegs]).&nbsp; This thing is MASSIVE - far bigger than Aria&#39;s 2018 Wind Dragon, Cyclo.&nbsp; And those claws and spines!</p>

<p>Our side bit here, the Bears&#39; cave, is fairly neat.&nbsp; The dynamite&nbsp;exposes the green crystal that the Goblin King is after.</p>

<p>Goblin King is fairly neat (though Bowie will always be the best Goblin King, lol).<br />
<br />
All- in-all, this is a really impressive set for being a small-medium set.&nbsp; I would love to see more large and detailed dragons like this (not necessarily&nbsp;just in Elves - I would love to see Castle theme make a comeback and have things like this).<br />
