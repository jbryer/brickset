<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">That being said the 12.99$ price point rarely disappoints, so let&rsquo;s discuss the set real quick and then you can decide if you&rsquo;d like to track one of these down.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Box/Instructions</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Box: Still the same box design. The back shows off all of the other sets available in this price range using the heart shaped buildable element each one comes with to denote which ones you need to collect for each of the Friends. The front features some nice artwork with Emma and Chico the cat in the corners which expands further on a new, even more fun looking design to stand out on the shelves. The overall design stays relatively the same however.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: The LEGO Friends sets of 2017 introduced a new manual design, the imagery on the back cover shows stylized versions of the mini-dolls with their signature pets, all of which are found in the 12.99$ price point. The manuals are otherwise the same well designed and implemented manuals we&rsquo;ve come to expect from LEGO. The change in design and artwork for the line is a nice inclusion, a shame it only lasted for that year as 2018 seems to have seen another radical design change.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Parts</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">As with many Friends sets in this price point, you will find relatively common parts for the Theme all in unique and fun colours. I always strongly recommend these small sets as decent parts packs at a discount price. Sadly this one doesn&rsquo;t offer much due to the nature of the vignette style build, however they do include a decent selection of dark purple coloured elements.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minidoll</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Emma: In this set Emma is wearing a nice dark blue skirt with a light purple top printed with flower pattern design. I believe these parts have been used in combination before for Emma, the mini-doll definitely looks familiar to me though I can&rsquo;t quite place where I&rsquo;ve seen this combo before just now.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Included with Emma is Chico the cat, her pet, apparently. A nice light grey tabby cat using what I believe is a brand new animal piece, this cat body is sculpted sitting down on its back legs, it could just be the same old cat piece, but to my eyes it does look slightly different from the original feline animal piece in older Friends sets. Probably just a trick of the colouring.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Only hair accessories are included with Emma, nothing for her hands, unless you include the printed photos she&rsquo;s made of her LEGO Friends companions. Three stickers applied to tiles showing Andrea and her pet bird, Emma with Chico and Mia with her pet pug.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The build</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">There is a lot of sticker placement in this build, several parts require stickers to be placed evenly to imitate photographer&rsquo;s equipment, a printer and images of Emma and some of her friends. The build is relatively simple aside from this and the assorted models are all very quick and easy to build. If your younger builder needs help the only help required will be placing the stickers evenly on the tiles and other elements which require additional detailing.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This isn&rsquo;t exactly a model, but a series of play elements put together to imitate the appearance of a Photo Studio, you have the camera on a pedestal or stand for elevated photo taking, a unique backdrop element with some accessories around it for Emma to take a photo of her pet, a small stand with accessories for different needs in photo taking as well as a hair brush to get everything just right.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">You&rsquo;ll also find a case of kitty chow, a special photo printer and a light blind to limit the natural light in the room to make a perfect photo. All of these elements together look great on display together, and they&rsquo;re fairly fun models for the target audience. Using imagination has always been part of LEGO, and these Friends sets rarely disappoint in that regards.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">More serious builders may find the disjointed lack of a dedicated model to be disappointing. Personally I still enjoy it, I especially enjoyed building the studio style lights on either side of the backdrop, as it was a fun clever little micro build to imitate proper lighting.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Apparently this year of Friends sets also included some sort of heart gimmick, you can take two parts and make a LEGO shaped purple heart, which can either be held by a mini-doll or placed somewhere in your LEGO Heartlake City display, the build uses the same parts as one of the Polybag sets from a few years prior and it works nicely for what you get.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Overall I find that the sets this year at this price point aren&rsquo;t bad, they look great for the target audience and feature a uniform design of detailed little elements that can be played with well and display nicely in a group. It isn&rsquo;t the strongest offering from this wave of sets though, I feel Olivia and Andrea offer a lot more than either of their other companions at this price point, but I could be biased.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I&rsquo;d recommend this set for fans of the Theme, it expands further on Emma&rsquo;s creative loving side and fits in nicely with the past Fashion Design sets at this price point. Now Emma can create fashionable new looks in her old Fashion Design Studio and then take pictures of her Friends in the Photo Studio, combine them all together in Emma&rsquo;s house and it makes for even more awesome fun for the younger crowd to enjoy.</span></span></span></span></p>
