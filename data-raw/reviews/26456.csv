And a neat set","<p>Every year the Friends line has a few sets around the ten $/&pound;/&euro; mark, featuring one of the girls and her hobby. And every year there is one that stands out as a parts pack for new or rare parts. Last year it was Emma&#39;s kiosk and this year it&#39;s Mia&#39;s beach scooter.</p>

<p>While the set by itself is a neat thing when constructed the highlight is the collection of parts: a new color for the scooter, two surfboards (of which one is printed) and a hairpiece which previously has appeared in only one other set. Wether you are a town or friends builder, this set is not to be missed.</p>

"lentil","2017-05-23T20:21:07.103Z","Great value as a beach accessory set!","<p>This little set offers a great value for a range of cute and useful little accessories. I&#39;m not generally a &quot;Friends&quot; person at all, but this one is really not that &quot;Friend&quot;-ly to begin with, is easy to modify to make it even less so, and offers parts that would be useful to add to any generic beach scene.</p>

<p>Considering its small size and price point, the set comes with a plethora of items and accessories:</p>

<ul>
	<li>one minidoll sporting a summery outfit, flip-flops, and a very nice helmet/ponytail hairpiece</li>
	<li>one pug puppy, with purple motorcycle goggles on her head, and a dog treat printed tile</li>
	<li>one scooter in lavender, plus bricks for building a sidecar that the pug (or a minifig passenger) can ride on. The sidecar is detachable so you could use this or not. The scooter has a small compartment built onto the back for carrying small cargo (up to 2 1x2 tiles worth)</li>
	<li>two surfboards: one plain lime green and one white with attractive printing</li>
	<li>a pair of lime green flippers</li>
	<li>a brick-built water bottle</li>
	<li>binoculars</li>
	<li>a circular tile with life preserver printing</li>
	<li>a green flag</li>
</ul>

<p>The main build is a lifeguard chair situated on a little beach near some waves. Really the only thing that screams &quot;Friends&quot; about this build is the 4x4 lavender plate on the chair floor, and this is easy enough to replace with another color (you surely have one lying about), should you desire a more traditional City look. I swapped in a blue plate, which looks great with the orange and lime green. To complete the de-Friending process, you can also replace the magenta flipper holder and flagpole base with a less silly color, and you end up with a little vignette that looks right at home in any traditional City/Coast Guard/Beach scene.</p>

<p>Overall highly recommended for its parts - especially if you can pick it up at a further discount at one of the many &quot;Friends&quot; sales that pop up!</p>

She has had a bedroom, a variety show stage with magic tricks, a lemonade stand and an archery stand, now she gets this beach scooter&hellip; with Olivia, Emma, Andrea and even Stephanie there is a consistent range of sets at this price point for their favorite hobbies and pastimes.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">With Mia she doesn&rsquo;t seem to have anything aside from liking pets and animals, so most of her sets are a bit Jill-of-all-trades. She&rsquo;ll do anything and everything and you can have lots of fun with what you get in her sets, but it&rsquo;s still unfortunate that most of the 12.99$ price point for Mia tends to be so unfocused as if you collect them all you can&rsquo;t display them all together in her home as well as the other Friends.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">That being said, let&rsquo;s discuss her set from 2017 and see if it&rsquo;s a decent set or something to ignore and skip over.</span></span></span></span></p>

I like this evolution of the original Friends box design.</span></span></span></span></p>

A serviceable manual design.</span></span></span></span></p>

The only different piece for her here is the helmet with ponytail which she&rsquo;s wearing while driving her scooter. There is no alternative hair piece for when she&rsquo;s sitting on her beach seat monitoring for dangers, which is a bit unfortunate, but honestly not so bad.</span></span></span></span></p>

You get some printed dog biscuit pieces and a buildable heart shaped accessory for Mia to hold.</span></span></span></span></p>

The model works fine for what it&rsquo;s going for, but honestly I feel they could have done a bit better, perhaps add a spot for the pug to sit as well so that Mia doesn&rsquo;t have to leave him on the scooter.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Beach Scooter: The main scooter is built using a sculpted piece, which we&rsquo;ve seen before, in fact I think she used a different coloured one to deliver her Lemonade from the Lemonade Stand set released a few years ago. The majority of the building revolves around making a space for the Pug to fit, a very nicely built up side-car that accommodates her pet and the second surf board with the printed detailing on it. It&rsquo;s a great model and I feel the target audience will love getting Mia to ride off to help rescue another Friend with her pet.</span></span></span></span></p>

I strongly recommend this set.</span></span></span></span></p>
