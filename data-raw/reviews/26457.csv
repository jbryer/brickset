<p><strong>Packaging and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The packaging is rather simple for what is actually within the box. We get a decent representation of Olivia in her work area designing robots and other gadgets. Front and back give a good impression and the colors are well suited for the theme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside you will find a great set of parts for a set of this size. You get not one but two bags of tools. One of those is a replacement bag but still it is great to get two of them. The tools are also in a light sand blue like color which makes them really stand out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You will also get 2 bags and a small sticker sheet included in the set. Thankfully none of the stickers are cleared-backed which removes a bit of worry when applying them. However,&nbsp;if your builder is still on the younger side I would strongly suggest helping them as the stickers do add a bit of character to Olivia&#39;s work area.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures/Dolls:</strong></p>

<p>We get one Minidoll in this&nbsp;set and it is Olivia. She comes with a decent torso piece (that sadly has no back printing) and a nice mix of lavender and hot pinks to round out her appearance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build and Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>The build may be a bit of a challenge for a younger builder but for older fans of the theme it will fly by in an instant. The multitude of stickers though may slow you down a bit but thankfully they are not too difficult to apply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you finish you will get 3 robots a design table and what appears to be a docking bay for the 3 robotic creations. I also really liked the buildable heart included in the set, my daughters use it as a stand for Olivia and it fits her well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>For the price the pieces in this set are great to have. The robots really grab the imagination and if you don&#39;t already have Olivia and are looking for a way to get her easily then this set is for you. Pretending to be the designer and working on the robots seems to be amusing and it is certainly fun to change the layout of these work spaces to suit your&nbsp;play needs. A good deal to be sure.&nbsp;</p>

Not a bad grouping of parts for the price.</span></span></span></span></p>

She includes the usual light purple skirt piece and the heart printed tee top. She includes a built-up robot control device using a LEGO Walkie Talkie piece and a stickered tile for the detailed controls.</span></span></span></span></p>

Zobo returns from the original Invention Workshop, featuring a similar upper torso build while this time he&rsquo;s been given wheels, he also gets a &lsquo;sister&rsquo; or &lsquo;girlfriend&rsquo; depending on your play preferences, Zuzu who has a printed radar dish for a lower dress and a very small little robot called Zobito. The &lsquo;Baby&rsquo; of the group. Some great looking buildable robots.</span></span></span></span></p>

It does feature sticker placement however, some builders may require assistance to place the stickers on properly. The builds for the robots are all fairly similar, ah, yes one thing to note, pay close attention to which studs go where. They are colour coded and I&hellip; admittedly&hellip; made a slight mistake in which stud I used resulting in the wrong look for the character until I realized my mistake. Even with the simple to follow instructions AFOLS like me can still make mistakes when rushing through the build.</span></span></span></span></p>

So you can pretend Emma is printing this picture off for Olivia and then giving it to her if you have both sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">There&rsquo;s also a heart shaped model build with two pink pieces and a small container with parts and a printed shipping label which is a very nice touch, Olivia just ordered something from Amazon for building another robot apparently.</span></span></span></span></p>

Olivia has always been a favorite of mine, she embodies some great role model ideals for young girls and she&rsquo;s a very creative individual capable of building little robots that just really struck me as being so unique and fun. Added this is a great update to the original Invention Workshop, and it doesn&rsquo;t have everything the same so you can combine the two together if you bought both and have a pretty large diorama area to play with.</span></span></span></span></p>
