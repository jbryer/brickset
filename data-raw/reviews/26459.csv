<p>I ignored the instructions and built from the picture. That was a fun puzzle. I did have to zoom in in some cases to figure it out. I previously did that only with polybags, and I figure that might not work with sets much larger than this. I understand the instructions for less advanced builders, but I liked this better than rushing through the booklet.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not interested in the heart charm made from 2 plate modified 3x2 with hole (part 3176), so I put those with the extras. Then again, I&#39;m not the target market for Friends. The knob on the back of the guitar is great for a minidoll to hold perpendicular to the body.&nbsp;I liked the short version of the speaker design often seen in Friends music sets.</p>

<p>Sometimes a bunch of separate tiny models in a set feels disjointed.<br />
It feels a little small for a $10 set - at least it had a bird if not another minidoll.<br />
I&#39;m considering #41307 Olivia&#39;s Creative Lab from the same batch of sets, at least with discounts/promos.</p>
