<p>When I was building the gift boxes, I liked how they put together the idea of a gift in a box, until...</p>

<p>The gift boxes have lids, and they don&#39;t stay put. With a little touch and they are off. So, in regards of playability, this is a problem. There is no way that you can play with the girl and have her carry the boxes in other means. You can&#39;t put it in the van without box lids coming out and parts inside falling. You need to play as if there is nitroglycerin in those boxes, (very very careful and SLOW). It is so bad, I have to give 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other eye popping issue: Where is the steering wheel?</p>

<p>Van is a good one. I like its doors and build, but missing the steering wheel also puts it off for me.</p>

<p>This is good set to complement the mail sets from the City that I bought before to help my daughter understand the concepts of mail sorting, delivery and what a post office does.</p>

<p>Overall, building it with my daughter was a good experience.&nbsp;</p>
