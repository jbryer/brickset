"KingAlanI","2017-03-14T18:17:15.073Z","Great take on classic subject matter","<p>My fat self had to get this to go with other LEGO pizzerias. #10036 Pizza To Go is one of my favorites from my kid collection, and #41092 Stephanie&#39;s Pizzeria is a set I liked from a couple years ago. (I also got #60150 Pizza Van and #70910 Scarecrow Special Delivery from this year&#39;s new sets but haven&#39;t built them yet.)</p>

<p>The set looks great. The Italian color scheme is a good both in itself and as a change of pace from bright Friends colors, though there are some of those and they mesh well. I liked the kitchen equipment being medium blue instead of bright light orange. The build only used a few of them during bag 1 - at first I thought the rest were extras. I remember one set that only used a few (maybe including a premade bag was easier than setting aside specific parts). Here, the rest were all used in bag 2, but maybe the designers were trying too hard to put them all somewhere. Fork and knife are not needed for pizza. (1 extra set of utensils is normal for extra parts)</p>

<p>The pizza prints and stickers are a great addition to what was already out there.</p>

<p>Glad to see a male minidoll; they&#39;re rarer than female minifigs.</p>

<p>Some colors in the instructions weren&#39;t clear, often a problem with LEGO. The pizza tiles weren&#39;t secure in the delivery vehicle or oven, which has been an issue with other LEGO pizzerias, and this set also has a lot of loose kitchen equipment. As usual for Friends furniture, figures can&#39;t sit on the smooth seats. Form over function annoys me in theory, and in practice, I need to get another part. I stockpile 1x2x1 panel with center divider (part 93905) for that.</p>

<p>I swear I could almost smell pizza at times during the build.</p>

<p>As usual, I&#39;m glad I waited for a sale (in this case, promotional items from the LEGO website rather than an outright discount elsewhere)</p>

"Cloveious","2017-06-12T09:50:47.937Z","When the moon hits your eye like a Heartlake Pizza Pie! That's Lego!","<p>This is an interesting set, I got it as a birthday gift from a friend and I think it has a lot of potential for expanding. Overall it is a good set but there is a few things that bother me about it.</p>

<p>The build:</p>

<p>Overall the build is great and really easy. I was able to build the thing to completion without looking at instructions and just the box art itself.</p>

<p>The only part of the build &nbsp;I found frustrating is a&nbsp;lot of pieces that aren&#39;t tied down to anything in this set such as the salad and the utensils. I found that moving and rotating the set to build things&nbsp;caused lots of chaos.</p>

<p>As far as vehicles go I love the little trike. It reminds me of an older generation Daihatsu Midget. However they could have included a steering wheel. It looks and feels stupid without one.&nbsp;The first thing I did when I finished building this was found an unused white and black steering wheel. The Lego friends doll still fits with one added.</p>

<p>The two friends dolls are okay. I wish they are easier to stick to the studs like the minifigures and I don&#39;t know anything about their back story. My one personal peeve I think the male dolls&nbsp;looks like the current&nbsp;Canadian Prime Minister thusly I&nbsp;have relegated him to the unused minfig bag in the lego bin.</p>

<p>Pieces:</p>

<p>I love the colors of the bricks. i love the Italian colors on the awning, the actual &#39;brick&#39; bricks that make up the pizza oven is really cool. I found the tan and violet colors rather interesting. I don&#39;t have a lot of sets that aren&#39;t from the 80&#39;s and I love that Lego has added colors since then.</p>

<p>I like the variety of food they attempt to give you from Pizza&#39;s to salads etc. The small details really make this set.</p>

<p>I also like the flowers and foliage adorned on the facade of the store front.</p>

<p>This was the very fist Lego Set I have ever had a missing piece in out of the box. The utensil set gave me only 5 forks and 6 knives. There was a lot of head scratching, looking around checking the floor to see if it was dropped rechecking the instructions. I went to Lego website for missing pieces and noticed it was Out of Stock. Maybe there are problems? I sent an e-mail of my complaint to customer service and never saw a response. However a couple weeks later I got an e-mail that they&#39;re shipping a replacement set.</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>This set is nice and open so it could be easy for someone to play with. However any movement and a whole bunch of stuff is going to go flying and come unhinged. I found a couple places in the Pizzeria under the balcony tables a little hard to place the larger friends doll. If a kid is playing with this they probably will lose a lot of small pieces.</p>

<p>I found my fat large adult fingers break things and knock things over easily.</p>

<p>For myself, I found this slid right at home in my eclectic lego city. A larger baseplate&nbsp;and a little effort could make a complete restaurant. I&#39;d love to&nbsp;rearrange things a bit enclose it and add more tables and chairs and a stairway to the second floor.</p>

<p>Value for money.</p>

<p>I think this set was around $29 Canadian and you get a lot for what you pay for. This set has a lot of interesting details and pieces that can certainly be parted out and go to other things. You probably won&#39;t feel ripped off by what you get.</p>
