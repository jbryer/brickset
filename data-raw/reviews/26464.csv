<p>I&#39;ll begin with the mini dolls.&nbsp; This set comes with three, Stephanie and her parents, Alicia&nbsp;and James.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stephanie&#39;s face was the same as ever, along with the hair.&nbsp; Her clothes have come in many other sets, and she comes with a blue bow.&nbsp;Personally, I dislike this&nbsp;as teenagers rarely wear bows, but LEGO doesn&#39;t forget how every single person who buys this set cannot live without having bows in their mini dolls&nbsp;hair.&nbsp; Wait...</p>

<p>James and Alicia are a lot more interesting.&nbsp; Their hairs may be new additions, though Alicia&#39;s mold is definitely not.&nbsp; Alicia&#39;s face is exclusive while James&#39; is not.&nbsp; Both of their clothes are exclusive, with James using the adult male body mold while Alicia uses, for some strange reason, a teen female body mold, even though she is an adult.&nbsp;It may be a factory mistake or just a odd decision by LEGO, but either way, it resides in my collection as an adult torso.</p>

<p>The build, overall, is quite easy.&nbsp; Not an overload of stickers, and the stickers they do use just add detail they are unable to build.</p>

<p>The interior has a kitchen with a dinning table, a living room, stairs, an office, a bathroom, and Stephanie&#39;s bedroom.&nbsp; The kitchen is quite nice, but I&#39;ve found the dinning area hard to access&nbsp;as it is right underneath the balcony which is not meant to come off.</p>

<p>The living room contains a sofa for three, a table, and a flat screen television showing a tennis match.</p>

<p>The stairs are not found in any other&nbsp;friend houses, and I hope they continue to include them in the waves of the future.</p>

<p>Under the stairs is a small area where you can store the brick built vacuum cleaner that comes in the set, which is a great use of space.</p>

<p>Upstairs, the office has just a table and spinney chair, plus a laptop.&nbsp; This is the only friend house set to include an office, incase you were curious.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Right next door&nbsp;is the the bathroom, which has a shower, toilet, and my favorite sink, which has a lovely sleek modern design.</p>

<p>Stephanie&#39;s bedroom has a bed(obviously) which looks quite nice, a desk, a balcony, and a basket with her tennis racket.&nbsp; All of the houses from the friend line include a balcony, but this is the first to have the balcony as a separate&nbsp;part to her room.&nbsp; I find this works a lot better as it gives her room a lot more space.</p>

<p>Sadly, this set includes no bedroom for Stephanie&#39;s parents, a trend among the line.&nbsp; I, as well as many other fans, have built an additional room for her parents, but I am hopping that the next set includes a bedroom for the parents.</p>

<p>(If you want to see a good example of this kind of custom, I would recommend&nbsp;EllieVtoys&#39; video)</p>

<p>All in all, this is a lovely set and a great addition to your LEGO city, whether you a friends fan or not.&nbsp; Only a few tweaks are necessary to accommodate&nbsp;minifigs, so this would work for them as well.&nbsp; This set has great playability and looks great.</p>
