For the second time we get a jungle themed set, the first one being the large Jungle Tree house set (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21125-1/The-Jungle-Tree-House"">21125</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong><br />
For it&#39;s price it&#39;s quite a large box, especially in thickness. This set includes 2 instruction booklets with some alternate building inspiration on the last pages of the second book.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong><br />
There is a large selection of grey and (earth)&nbsp;green plates and bricks. This set contains some earth green pieces which until now only appear is this set, 2 1x2 cheese&nbsp;slopes and 6 2x8 plates. The parts come in 4 numbered bags.&nbsp;The famous orange brick separator is included as well.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
This set contains 3 minifigures and one brick build animal. Steve wears a full leather armor&nbsp;which is exclusive to this set. The mobs in this set are 2 skeletons, both equipped with a bow. The included Ocelot is the same one as in the 21125 Jungle Tree house and looks excellent in my opinion.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong><br />
As with many Minecraft sets we start off with building the figures and the small builds like torches and flowers. We move on to building the base of the temple. The build is very&nbsp;straightforward and the steps are easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With bag 2 the play&nbsp;features&nbsp;of this set are added. A series of 3 levers need to be build which locks a wall with a chest behind it in place. If you pull the right levers up and down the wall can be pulled away for the back of the model. A flick fire missile is placed in back of the temple to simulate a dispenser shooting a arrow.</p>

<p>Bags 3 and 4 focus on the roof of the temple. Various vines are added to give the model more detail. You wrap up the build by creating a nice jungle tree. Can&#39;t ever have enough Minecraft trees!</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong><br />
The finished model impresses in size and looks like a proper Minecraft ruin. The outside model is almost an exact copy of the temple in game, props to the designer for that! The roof comes off very easy to give you access&nbsp;to the inside of the model and its play features.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong><br />
The Minecraft Jungle Temple is a good set to add to any Minecraft collection. The Minifigure selection is great and the set has some cool play features. Is there any downside you ask?&nbsp;Well, the pillars on top of the roof and the little step like build on te side are very easy to knock off because they are attached&nbsp;with just a 2x2 jumper plate. This can be fixed very easily by just removing the jumper plates to get full clutch power. The price per parts ratio is spot on and the set&nbsp;is bigger on your table then it looks on the box. This sets gets a score of 4 out of&nbsp;5 from me.</p>
