<p><strong>The figures</strong></p>

<p>Player Figures</p>

<p>Steve-Pretty much the same as all other Steve mini-figures, but he has a fishing rod and iron leggings, which is good to get.</p>

<p>Alex-Also very similar&nbsp;to all other Alex mini-figures, but she has gold leggings and scissors representing sheers. Happy to get these.</p>

<p>Hostile Mobs</p>

<p>Zombie-least special figure&nbsp;in the set, same as always, but at least he has a wooden shovel.</p>

<p>Enderman- Great to see in this set. I had not ever gotten one before this set as they are kind of&nbsp;rare. Plus he gets a dirt block to carry</p>

<p>Animals</p>

<p>Cyan Sheep- Great to see another variant of the sheep figure. It can be sheered</p>

<p>Cat-the cat is very cute and cool to see in Lego</p>

<p><strong>Waterfall Base Build</strong></p>

<p>The Outside</p>

<p>The outside terrain looks good as always, but the base itself is very unique in a good way. it looks to be carved out of a mountain and built by the players to use as a house. It has a nice look and color scheme with the white and brown Walls. Surprisingly&nbsp;the base is closed up around the back and looks like the inside of the mountain. The doors on front and back lead very nicely to the inside.</p>

<p>The Inside</p>

<p>The room under the waterfall is small but features a bed, carpet, bookshelf, and flower in a pot.</p>

<p>The big main room has 2 chests, 2 item display cases, 4 cyan wool(or Diamond) blocks and 3 crafting tables. A diamond sword and fish are in the display cases. If everything on the floor is removed the cyan carpet makes the shape of a pickaxe.</p>

<p>The room opposite of the waterfall is open and has the secret lava entrance. It has a furnace and an anvil</p>

<p><strong>The features</strong></p>

<p>the lava entrance is a 4 by 4 section of lava that can be halfway slid over to reveal the stone path</p>

<p>The base transforms completely by hinging open both sides and removing the roof. This brings a totally different look to the thing and increases&nbsp;play dramatically and gives great access to the interior.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set deserves a 5 out of five for the great transformation features, Great figures, and lovely overall look. And I got it on sale at Walmart. I hope this review&nbsp;was helpful.</p>
