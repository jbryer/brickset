Combo NEXO Powers, the ability to use three powers at once to unlock even more powerful attacks.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The packaging for this set is the exact same as the Ultimate Knights, a cardboard case which can fold open and holds the parts all very nicely. They sit on the shelves in stores and are easy to spot. Very nice looking upgrade, and the imagery shows off the features of the set quite nicely.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigure</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Macy: She has no armour or weapons in this set, but she does feature a unique print design, which is not found in any other set. Her face features the same expressions as found on other figures and is dual-sided, her helmet is also the same as others. Aside from the torso and leg prints there isn&rsquo;t much to her, but it is nice to see the character with different outfits for battling against the enemies of Knighton.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The Battle Suit</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Using Mixle joints and a brand new sculpted piece for the &lsquo;cockpit&rsquo; section this set is a very well designed little Minifigure scale suit. You can get a lot of dynamic poses out of this thing and it towers about the height of a Bigfig or so making for a fun little battle suit.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Part of the play features included with this year of sets are the clip joints LEGO uses for certain elements, these joints are located on the back of the Battle Suit and can be used to attach parts from the Knights&rsquo; vehicles to the back of them to make them bulkier and give them more abilities or weapons, like added jet propulsion or massive attack cannons.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The NEXO Powers she has access to for her Combo Powers are Wrecking Ball, Iron Dragon, Battle Cry, Slime Blast and Mightiness. Use these powers in any combination you which and watch the enemies fly as Macy bashes them to pieces with her giant mace weapon.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Battle Suits add some interesting new ideas to the LEGO NEXO Knights Theme and some great play features, mixing and matching NEXO powers and vehicle attachments can see a whole host of possibilities. I&rsquo;d strongly recommend nabbing several of the sets from this year and having a host of fun just making up whatever you want, the simple clip joint piece used to attach parts to the Battle Suit means you can also make your own attachments. Yep, strongly recommended.</p>
