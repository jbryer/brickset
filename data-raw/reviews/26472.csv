<p>Aaron Fox is the only minifigure in this set, and the exclusive suit is amazing!! It appears to be an almost Jedi-like hybrid, with the green details jazzing it up from just plain green. Aaron&#39;s family crest is also a nice distraction.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The build starts with the (I guess you could call it a) cockpit. After adding on a few pieces, the build travels to the legs, which are jointed in two places: the hips and the ankles. The feet are bulky compared to the legs, which I&nbsp;assume is to add balance to the overall build. Next come the arms, which are designed decently. The shoulders suggest armor, all while allowing for almost any pose you can think of. The hands are your usual fists, allowing for a variety of accessories to be added (I like using ninja swords for chef knives; they work for table knives too!).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next comes Aaron&#39;s Blazer Bow, which is recreated perfectly at this scale. The shooting action is achieved with a spring-loaded shooter with an extra missile in trans orange, whilst the arms of the bow are achieved&nbsp;with the spider legs from Bionicle, also in trans orange. It looks good and performs even better! The combo Nexo Shield is a combo Nexo shield, but the attachments are what make it unique!&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Two Axeheads&nbsp;in Trans Orange</li>
	<li>An SNOT brick for his right leg to attach to</li>
	<li>A&nbsp;separate&nbsp;part for his other leg to rest on</li>
	<li>and 5 NEXO&nbsp;Powers to decide about!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>The main build is very poseable, with nine joints which allow for increased maneuverability and&nbsp;dexterity. For that, the playability, and the price, I give 5 stars!!</p>
