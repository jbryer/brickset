<p><strong>Anyhoo, the Build</strong><strong>. </strong>Not very long, but it does have some interesting techniques, such as the way the feet and arms are made. I wish LEGO could have filled in the gaps inthe Battle Suit&#39;s feet, but it looks alright. I don&#39;t think you would buy this for the building experience. I suspect that the main draw would be . . .</p>

<p><strong>The Parts.</strong> Flame-Yellowish-Orange lovers rejoice! This set has many parts in the aforementioned color. Most notable are the <a class=""tag"" href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6069171/roof-tile-1x2-45%C2%B0-w-1-3-plate"">6069171</a> weird slope thingy, the <a class=""tag"" href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6024286/roof-tile-1-x-2-x-2-3-abs"">6024286</a>&nbsp; Double-Cheese Slope thingamibob, the <a class=""tag"" href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6099728/plate-w-bow-1x2x2-3"">6099728</a> Bow Slope thingamajig, the <a class=""tag"" href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6022064/brick-w-bow-1-3"">6022064</a> 1x3 Bow Slope thingeh, and, of course, the <a class=""tag"" href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6172169/plate-w-bow-2x2x2-3-no-13"">6172169</a> Double Bow Slope piece thing, with Axl&#39;s Bull symbol printed onto it. Yes, I said &quot;printed&quot; --- there are no stickers whatsoever in this set. But wait --- there&#39;s more! I&#39;m sure many potential buyers and Nexo-Fans are looking for the <a class=""tag"" href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6173203/rotor-w-4-85-hole-no-1"">6173203</a>, otherwise known as the new Nexo Battle Suit Shield piece. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s necessary to have this piece --- perhaps skilled MOCers can create a geometric design to duplicate the little Nexo Power Shield placements. It&#39;s easier to get the big piece though. And how could I forget the little Trans-Reddish-Orange 1x1 pyramids? Or the Mega Trans-Reddish-Orange Ax Head? Or the Medium-Bluish-Grey Apollo studs? There&#39;s also two <a class=""tag"" href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6168776/roof-tile-1x2-deg-45-w-o-knobs"">6168776</a>s, one <a class=""tag"" href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6138695/flat-tile2x3-w-angle"">6138695</a>, and two Orange pieces on the Battle Suit&#39;s back, so as to connect a machine gun or something outlandish like that. Be warned I didn&#39;t tell you all the parts! Obviously, I left most out because they were common or what have you.</p>

<p>There&#39;s only one <strong>Minifigure---</strong> Axl. For those who have him, he&#39;s nothing new, except the differences in color, and the robe-like printing on his legs and torso. His head is the same as all the other Axls, and his helmet and visor are the same from Year 1, as are his arms, but his big torso piece is Flame-Yellowish-Orange to match his suit. It might be worth noting, for the amusement of the little ones, Axl and other bigfigs ( such as Hulk, Killer Croc, Trolls, Thanos, etc. ) can swap arms, because they share the method by which the previously mentioned appendage is attached, a Technic Pin. Unfortunately, Axl comes with no minifigure-sized weapon that he can use outside of his suit, but yuo can make one out of the spare parts.</p>

<p><strong>The Playability </strong>is high, partly because the Battle Suit has lots of articulation, and partly because of the Nexo Shields included. The Battle Suit bends at the hips, ankles, waist, shoulders, and wrists, and you get five Nexo Powers! Definitely good value.</p>

<p>My <strong>Overall Opinion? </strong>Pretty good. Lots of Nexo Powers, lots of good parts, and an Axl minifigure. However, you might have noticed the title to this review: Don&#39;t take this apart if you value your sanity. It&#39;s simply because the connections of certain pieces are so tight, it reduced me to using my teeth to remove some. But, after a few times, you get used to it, and now I use a Brick Separator to do most of the work. But if you ignore that, you get a small set, with lots of Nexo Powers, and lots of good parts, and a minifgure, as I said before. I suggest you snag it on discount, because $10 is <em>way</em> too high.</p>
