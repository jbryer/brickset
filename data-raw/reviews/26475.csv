Personally I find it fulfilling to pick up small sets from a wide variety of most themes and more of the sets from the &quot;evergreen&quot; products of Star Wars, City, and the like.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nexo Knights has some great color combos, interesting building styles and unique minifigs, so I had been on the lookout for a small set to get in on the action without making a large investment into the theme. 70347 is the perfect match, including a minifigure from each side of the conflict, sword &amp; lightning elements, and an ample supply of the trademark Neon Orange pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The size of the mobile artillery unit was a pleasant surprise and the whole setup is&nbsp;reminiscent of the Castle starter packs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&#39;re not planning on going all-in for the Nexo Knights theme but want to grab a couple minifigs and interesting parts then this is the set for you!</p>
