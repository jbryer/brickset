What drew me to this set was the purple enemy minifig with the unnusual &quot;feet&quot; design (and purple is my favourite colour). The amount of playability they packed into such a small design though is fantastic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>Interesting build and what I really liked was seeing how all the play features came together. The only part that could be a little annoying is there is one part where you are making the side sections that can become wings and for a few steps both sides are only connected to the main &#39;body&#39; of the build by 1 stud each. This means that until you get a few more steps in, these sides can easily come loose. Only a very minor issue I feel and I only discovered it because I was building it in my lap instead of on a flat surface.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>Many dark blue parts that look great in person. I didn&#39;t realise just how many there were until I opened the box. I&#39;m not up-to-date on rarity of pieces and colour, but I really don&#39;t remember seeing a lot of this colour before (maybe in large creator sets?).</p>

<p>Apart from the colouring there are interesting flat 90 degree pieces, as well as the pieces used to make the droid minifig and, as mentioned earlier, the &quot;feet&quot; of the villain in the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>So much playability! The front portion of the vehicle can disconnect from the back, where both have their own control panels, allowing you to have both land and air vehicles. The 2 extended portions of the front of the vehicle can actually be removed and used by the minifigs as lance weapons (though a minifig may have to tilt back a bit to keep balance holding one).&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t yet have one of the new &#39;mech&#39; sets that are released with this wave, but with the set split into the two vehicles, the air vehicle can actually be attached to a mech, providing it with wings.</p>

<p>Though not a play feature as such, I actually find the intricate and dynamic sculpt of the enemy minifig to invite play as it looks as if the figure is gliding with a storm beneath them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final thoughts:</p>

<p>I found this set to be so much more than I expected, especially since it&#39;s one of the smaller of the theme. While this may not be a display piece for adult collectors (apart from that enemy minifig, though I think I&#39;ve talked about that enough lol),&nbsp;I highly recommend it if you like the colours and playing with your Lego.</p>
