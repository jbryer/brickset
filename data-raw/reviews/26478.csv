<p>Clay&#39;s Falcon Fighter Blaster is unquestionably in the second theme being most definitely a spaceship.</p>

<p>Each of the five Knights seems to get a personal vehicle in each years sets, and Clay gets some of the best (last years Rumble Blade, and this one), with high part counts - although fewer than Aaron and Axl - (Lance and particularly Macy seem to have been short changed in that respect, combined their vehicles from the first 2 years have fewer parts than the other 3 individually!)</p>

<p>The Falcon Fighter looks quite impressive, with the Nexo Knights base colour scheme of Earth Blue and Transparent Fluorescent Reddish Orange - with Dark Azur as Clay&#39;s &#39;Blue Knight&#39; personal colour.</p>

<p>The main cockpit is brick built with some excellent snot work to allow for the Earth Blue and Dark Azur double stripe around the cockpit. A relatively simple technic mechanism allows the whole cockpit to slide back into the main body of the ship pushing the wings out into &#39;attack mode&#39;.</p>

<p>A mini flyer detaches from the back of the ship (part of the &#39;Combine&#39; play element of this years NK theme) and carries a six-stud shooter. This flyer can be attached to the back of any of the NK Battlesuits to give them extra firepower and flight.</p>

<p>I particularly like that the Nexo Knights vehicles all have places (generally clips) to store their weapons and shields - something other themes (I&#39;m looking at you Ninjago) could learn from.</p>

<p>The bad guys for this set are a couple of mini monsters, primarily with printed face parts - although the little square guy has the interesting construction of loose minifig arms with a technic pin on the other end, fitting into a technic hole (Design 28660, currently only available in Sand Blue) - which might produce some interesting constructions in the future.</p>

<p>The main bad guy is a brick built monster in the style of last years Sparkks and Burnzie, in light grey and purple (Medium Stone Grey and Medium Lilac) with Transparent Light Blue weapons, wings and highlights - nicely representing the stone and lightning themes of this years bad guys.</p>

<p>The overall construction is satisfying and not overly complex, even with the technic mechanisms - which do make the spaceship body very solid. The bright orange parts might clash a bit with the trans red orange, but is used sparingly and consistently in this years vehicles so I think it&#39;s OK.</p>

The Falcon Fighter certainly seems to have enough potential connection points - but alas that was not to be.</span></p>

<p>Plenty of play value and a great looking Spaceship, a worth addition to Clay&#39;s and the Nexo Knights arsenal of vehicles.</p>
