"Kuunz","2018-02-12T16:19:45.587Z","Amazing Value","<p>LOTS of cool pieces for such a small set.</p>

<p>It comes with 2 &iquest;orcs? and the main character.<br />
The orcs&nbsp;have 2 different armors, both look really neat with many details, 2 different weapons and are, easily, the highlight of the set.<br />
The Ninja is the same as the other Ninjago sets, but still cool.<br />
<br />
The building of the snake trap is fast, like any small set, but it looks really nice by itself.<br />
Noticeable pieces inclues, a chainsaw with an attaching fist, 5 snakes, the snakes cocoon and 2 weeds.<br />
<br />
Overall, the set is worthy for the orcs alone, but everything else is really nice for such a small price tag.</p>

THe build has a function, the egg can break, and the snakes can come out. Thanks to the lot of figures, the set is very playable. The figures are precisely made. The minibuild goes good with the other sets in the wave.</p>

<p>I would rate this set with an overall 5 stars!</p>
