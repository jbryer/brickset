<h2><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></h2>

<p>Included in this set are three minifigures; Jay, Ninja of Lightning and two of the villains of this wave, Vermillion Commander Blunck and Tannin. All three minifgures are fantastic, and are, as has come to be expected from Ninjago sets, very detailed. All three have alt faces. Jay has more of a leather armor-type-thing on his torso than usual, and has the now-normal two tone ninja hoods. And he has sandals, I guess. But the two stars are Blunck and Tannin. Both are insanely detailed, showing the Vermillion snakes building up their bodies. But my personal favorite parts is the newly-molded armor and helmet pieces, and just how detailed and ornate they are. Unfortunately, neither of the helmets cover the head all the way, leaving the Vermillion&#39;s alt faces just visible under the helmets.<br />
Jay and Blunck each come with accessories; Jay with the new Slo-Mo Time Blade, and Blunck with a newly molded axe that looks pretty cool. It&#39;s wierd that Tannin wasn&#39;t given a weapon. Two red snakes come included.</p>

<h2><strong>The Build:</strong></h2>

<p>The build is not difficult, but, for the Vermillion speeder in particular, surprisingly Technic-lenient. Yeah, this is not a hard set to build.</p>

<h2><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></h2>

<p>Two builds are included: Jay&#39;s Desert Lightning, and the Vermillion Speeder. First we will look at the slightly underwhelming Speeder. It is mostly built around a smaller tank tread, with built on swords and a generally spiky look. Two of the new-mold Vermillion snakes stand guard on the front of the Speeder. That part looks good, I guess, but the worst section is in the back, where it is driven. The stand where it is suggested to put Tannin is dangerously close to the rolling treads, and makes one wonder if he drew the short straw to get that job. And it is assumed that you can place another figure on the back, but the rear-facing blade makes it very difficult to position someone there. The color scheme would be okay, if not for the burnt orange sword-things. But it is nice to have some opposition to the heroes.<br />
The real star is the namesake, the Desert Lightning. It feels a lot like previous Ninjago sets, both bikes and larger models. I don&#39;t know how LEGO makes a series of sets that feel like they came from a continuous source (Thanks Nya) but they did. Like every other bike, it feels a bit oversized, but whattyagonnado. The transforming function that is trademark to the Ninjago sets is a bit underwhelming (just flipping up the engines and folding a blade down) but hey, it&#39;s there. The color scheme is very nice and eye-catching, with a new blend of blue, dark blue and gold. It also comes with two forward-facing stud shooters.</p>

<h2><strong>Overall:</strong></h2>

<p>Overall this is a very nice set for the price point, and too be expected given previous offerings. Like I said, for the discount I found this set is fantastic, but even at it&#39;s usual $19.99 price I would wholeheartedly reccommend it, just on impulse.</p>
