<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with Lloyd, Cole and a Vermillion, the new enemy. The ninja robes are better designed than ever, a recurring idea that works. The Vermillion has neat armor and an even cooler helmet.</p>

<p><b>Build and Design</b></p>

<p>The design for this set is stellar! The dragon prow, the tucked-away cockpit, everything!! The best part is definitely the canoes, the first in its color, I think. The front has a wide area for a minifig to stand for the cannons, effectively represented by two stud shooters. Did I mention the wings?</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Being a fan of NINJAGO, most of the sets are good. This one, however, takes the cake! Every aspect of this set is playable, and the canoes are a nice touch. 5 stars for everything and</p>

<p>Great&nbsp;Job, LEGO!!!</p>

<p>(Side&nbsp;note: I have noticed that the ninja appear to be wearing... sandals? Fascinating!)</p>
