First, the build; the iron doom mech looks great, it&#39;s tall, intimidating, and really just plain awesome. The printed clock piece is an epic design, and the function to spin it using gears in the back is fun. The only gripe I have about the mech is the arms. They don&#39;t have a great range of motion and seem kinda short. The side build is also very nice indeed. It includes a tower with an egg and flag, and a prison cell. It can be arranged in many different ways and even combines with 70621-1. Now onto the <em><strong>real</strong></em> gravy of this set, the figures. Oh jeesimus, the figures. This set includes Jay, Lloyd, Wu, Commander Blunck, and The Hands of Time themselves. These figures are great, with the HoTs being my favorites by far. This set also includes a jet ski for Lloyd, and <strong><em>all four</em></strong> Time Blades. The only gripe I have with the figures is Wu, as I believe this is his just Rise of the Snakes variant. However, this set is awesome and <em>most certainly </em>worth the money. If you&#39;re a ninjago fan with some cash to get rid of, go get this and 70621-1 before getting any other HoT set!</p>

"Binnekamp","2018-05-10T17:47:14.37Z","Stylish, substantial, a bit statue-like but still great!","<p>With a set titled &#39;Dawn of Iron Doom&#39;,&nbsp; how can you go wrong? I looked forward to this set. I collect mechs, and after the excellent Samurai Mech, Fangpyre mech, Fire mech, Titan mech duel and Salvage M.E.C., my standards for Ninjago were high. So is the set as awesome as the title? Is it a worthy addition to the Ninjago mech family? In this in-depth look at this set, I&#39;ll share my experience and tell you the answer!</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>To start of, let&#39;s talk about the minifigures. For some this is the best part of this set. We get six: Sensei Wu, Lloyd, Jay, Commander Blunck, Acronix and Krux.</p>

<p><strong>Sensei Wu</strong> is looking classic with his tan hat, but he has a sacred flute on his back.&nbsp;Who knows? Would it work against Vermillion snakes? This garb has previously appeared in the Day of the Departed wave, although his tan hat hasn&#39;t appeared in awhile. Strangely he has a black staff.</p>

<p>Next up are the two ninja <strong>Lloyd </strong>and <strong>Jay</strong>. They sport their Hands of Time garbs, which have dark colours like dark green and blue next to their usual colours. Jay has an alternate confused face, whilst Lloyd has his standard frown/concentrated face (since Rebooted anyway). They both have a pair of katana, which they can hold in their standard shoulder armour on their backs. They appear in this outfit in other sets, but without the black shoulder armour.</p>

<p><strong>Commander Blunck </strong>is the only Vermillion warrior in this set. Unlike his other soldiers, he is orange. This lowers playability a bit, as there are no orange snakes to portray him being disintegrated. He sports a brilliant armor piece with intricate details, flanked by detailed snake ornaments. His helmet has trans-orange snakes popping out (molded to the helmet), which limits the re-use of the part. His torso is nearly armourless and features a terrifying print of the tangled snakes he consists of. I&#39;d reckon he looks just as good without his torso armour because of this print! He has an axe with a custom dual moulded snake-ornament axe head. Blunck appears in one other set. Finally, the set features the time twins</p>

<p><strong>Acronix</strong> and <strong>Krux</strong>. They are the main draw of the set, and for good reason! They feature a similar asymetric mirrored armour pattern. However, Krux (the old twin) has a darker shade of red and more battle damage than his brother. He also features an hourglass, whereas Acronix features an Ipod-like music player. Both wear a green tattered cape/shoulder cloth. They also both feature the hood element from the Rogue collectible minifigure, but in black and with their copper symbol printed on it. They look very sinister with it on. When they aren&#39;t wearing it, they can also use their included hair pieces instead. Krux has a light bluish grey hairpiece with a withdrawn hairline, and Acronix has Qui-gon Jinn&#39;s hairpiece in black. This is a great inclusion for the set! Krux also has an alternate face where he doesn&#39;t wear face paint. Instead he wears glasses and a moustache as his alter ego &#39;Docter Saunders&#39;. For weapons they can use the four (!) time blades between them, or they can use the custom dual-molded Vermillion sword instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, the set has seven <strong>red standard snakes</strong>. They normally work well with the Vermillion figures, but not now, as Blunck has a different colour. They do work well with the Iron Doom itself, as that <em>does </em>consist of red snakes (in-story at least).</p>

<h2>As a parts pack</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a $/&euro;/&pound; 59.99 parts pack, there certainly are a few draws. The set has the beautiful printed 4x4 dish clock head piece (<a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3960pb038&amp;idColor=18"">3960pb038</a>) and the 6x6 dish with fan print (<a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=44375bpb04&amp;idColor=11"">44375bpb04</a>) piece behind it. It has four Uruk Hai swords (10050) and two Hero Factory blades (11305) in the copper. The set includes all four time blades, also in copper. There are many parts in gunmetal/pearl dark grey, such as three of the pointed wedge part (<a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=22391&amp;idColor=77"">2391</a>). The set has a variety of curved and sloped parts. Other cool parts include the new snake half parts (28588), Vermillion sword part (<a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=25277pb01&amp;idColor=77"">25277pb01)</a>, Vermillion axe part (<a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=25276pb01&amp;idColor=77"">25276pb01</a>) and&nbsp;cocoon half and egg half used for the Vermillion Egg. And there are also many parts in reddish brown for making wooden structures with, such as the two scaffolding parts (<a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=64448&amp;idColor=88"">64448</a>), two rock panels (<a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=47847&amp;idColor=88"">47847</a>), three 2x2 round bricks with flutes (<a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=92947&amp;idColor=88"">92947</a>) and the two ladders (6020). There are also reddish brown doorposts (<a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=60599&amp;idColor=88"">60599</a>), which might be useful for creating structures. Other parts of note are a trans red 4x4 round plate with 2x2 hole (<a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=11833&amp;idColor=17"">11833</a>), reddish brown A-frame plates (<a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=15706&amp;idColor=88"">15706</a>), the dark brown segmented leg parts (<a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=15064&amp;idColor=120"">15064</a>). If you look for mech joints, you are out of luck though. There are only two bionicle-sized ball joints and holders for the shoulders, and one mixels-sized ball joint and holder in the tail. Finally, there is a brick separator, which is always handy to have.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The build is the standard experience for a set from 2017. There is a lot of Studs Not on Top (SNOT), technic and generally fiddly building involved. This makes the mech and tower sturdy and detailed, but also very parts dense. The base of the Iron doom is basically technic and plates only until you add a few bricks at the end. Even the outpost tower uses technic! During the build, there was a slight oddity. The build starts with the prison part of the Vermillion structure. Then, the entire Iron Doom is built. And only then do you build the outpost tower.</p>

<h2>Competed set</h2>

<p>Now it&#39;s on to the completed set! Minifigures are fun to have, but for many the set itself is where it&#39;s at! So first, I&#39;ll talk about the Jetski. Then about the outpost, and finally about the Iron Doom.</p>

<h3>Jet ski</h3>

<p>Lloyd gets his own jetski to traverse the swams. It features two swords on the side that can hinge outward. This doesn&#39;t look particularly pleasing, as they hinge from the far back. This makes them look like thin aerial brakes instead of blades or even wings. The inclusion of the jetski suggests that the Outpost sits on murky swamp water.</p>

<h3>Outpost</h3>

<p>The second-largest part of the set is the Vermillion outpost/base/prison tower. This consists of a prison section and tower section. Both structures are built on lime green plates to suggest swampy water.<br />
The <strong>Treestump prison </strong>consists of a hollow tree stump with a gate of sorts to hold in the prisoner. At the floor a 4x4 round ring with 2x2 tile in the center take up the floor space, leaving few studs. At the front, a snake is mounted on a clip. The interior is hard to access, as you can only enter it through the opening. The back and top are fully enclosed. The top has two pearl dark grey battlements (?) and two branches with leaves. The top has the largest studded surface of the entire set. However, there is no good cover around the edges against ranged attackers. Good thing the ninjas haven&#39;t brought their throwing stars! At the base of the prison and at the top of the prison, there are clips. These connect tot either the tower, the ladders, or set 70621 Vermillion Attack.<br />
The <strong>Vermillion tower </strong>features the ladders and an action feature. If you tip a spear at the top, this will in turn tip a flag to drop the Vermillion egg. THis egg is large enough to house the snakes included in the set, but also has trans red 1x1 round plates for when there&#39;s nothing else in them. This egg can fall on a hinged plank consisting of tiles below, which <em>could </em>launch a minifigure. In practice, it depends on how you dorp the egg. It can land in the front. Or it can hit the figure before the plank. But sometimes it does work! However, this comes at the cost of the plank being too smooth to put a minifigure on it without it toppling off sooner or later. The frictionless hinge also doesn&#39;t help. You could put the Vermillion sword on the clip in front of it and point it downwards. This can stop the plank from hinging forward atleast. There are two such clips on the front and back of the tower.<br />
The tower also features ladders, which are a great addition! You can take them off and put them between the connection points with the prison to make walkways of sorts. At the top, there is a small place for the egg to rest. And not much else. There is not much place to stand minifigures on any place of the tower. However, a good use of the tower is to use the top ladder (which is hinged sideways)&nbsp; to enter the Iron Doom. It has to be very close to the tower to do so though, so this doesn&#39;t look particularly good. Finally, the tower also features a flag (consisting of two stickered flags).<br />
The tower and prison combine well together, but are just as fun being separate parts. If you add the egg emplacement from 70621 Vermillion Ambush, you get a 3/4 circle of sorts of three very adjacent tree stump-like structures. This doesn&#39;t look particularly realistic, but it&#39;s nice that the option is there. It looks even better scattered separately, as it now feels like a larger swamp area.</p>

<h2>Iron Doom</h2>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Now for the main draw of the set, finally! For me this was the deciding factor of the set. Is it any good? The Iron Doom looks great for sure. Using many, many angles and sharp curves, it looks menacing and mechanical. The half-snake pieces are used well to suggest that it is inhabited and animated by small snakes.<br />
The<strong> central clock </strong>with all four time blades ties the set together well and makes for a change for the better regarding collectable mcguffins in lego sets. Usually they are place on portals in the largest set in the theme. Here the portal is <em>mobile </em>and semi-sentient, being a mech animated by snakes! The clock face can be spun around with gears on the back. It&#39;s odd that you have to do this with one of two gears, which spin in opposite directions because they are both linked to the same third gear. But I guess this makes the clock spin longer because they counterbalance each other. Or it&#39;s one for forward and one for back? Either way, it&#39;s symmetrical at least. When the blades are fixed to the back, they have to be angled up far enough, lest they cover the gears for this feature.<br />
Speaking of which, the mech has two large <strong>blades </strong>with extended half Vs for handles, continueing the V theme which is very prominent in all Vermillion vehicles. This becomes extra prominent when they are put on its back.They can be held by the mech as well. The fingers lock them securely in place, which is a nice touch of realism. Another way to attack is the <strong>projectile launcher</strong> built into its &#39;head&#39;, which is a nice feature. The two Uruk Hai swords can even be angled outward to make it seem like it&#39;s head splits open for it (although it works without doing this). Despite having a head, the <strong>cockpit</strong> is right on top of the clock. Here the time twins can sit on either side of the clock with a curved control panel (stickered) for each of them. Although they practically sit on top of the mech, the shoulder pads above each arm make them blend in well. Overall, the mech is built very sturdily and only <strong>moves</strong> in the places it is meant to move, such as the segmented tail and arms. There are a few splaces where it does hinge, such as at it&#39;s neck and at the front of its tail, but this can be ignored during normal use as there is only technic under there.</p>

<h3>Issues</h3>

<p>This talk about movement brings me to my main issue with the Iron Doom: the <strong>poseability</strong>. The tail moves side to side at two spots and in all directions at the last segment. It&#39;s rather short, so it&#39;s not going to hit anything that&#39;s not behind the mech. The shoulders move in all directions, but are hindered by the bulky armour in front of them. They are also situated rather far back. They mostly move up and down, although they can&#39;t move down fully. Like with 70592 Ronin Salvage M.E.C., the elbows only move up and down and do not turn, unlike previous ninjago mechs, which used a ball joint for the elbows. This poses a problem for it&#39;s poseability, as the swords will always point inward due to this. With the shoulder limitations this effectively makes it hard to use the swords at all, as their 180 degree angle to the hands limit their reach even further. Even using the swords in a reverse grip doesn&#39;t work because the tips of the handles pint inwards even more and will hit the mech.<br />
This poseability is further comprimised by this staticness of the base. The Iron Doom can&#39;t lean forward with legs unlike all other mechs. A good way to rectify these issues would have been swiveling waist articulation (again, like almost all previous ninjago mechs). The set lacks this though. However, this can be modded by switching the 1x2 bricks with axle hole with 1x2 bricks with pin hole in the connection of the upper torso with the tail. This makes the upper torso spin freely. This might make the mech a bit too dynamic, but it is great for play. I&#39;m disappointed that lego hadn&#39;t taken <em>any </em>of these issues into consideration. I understand that they wanted the set to be sturdy, but right now it&#39;s basically a nicely curved statue with arms, a swinging tail and a head! Did they not get complaints during playtesting?</p>

<p>Another -minor- issue I had is that the <strong>neck and head</strong> both hinge forward (it can&#39;t look up, sadly). The hinge for the head itself posed a problem for me. My parts were too loose, which caused it to droop down too easily. I have rectified this by switching it out with the same part from elsewhere from the set.</p>

<p>A third gripe I have is the inclusion of the outpost. It&#39;s a nice, modular model, but does it mesh with the Iron Doom? Well, kind of. In the story the Iron Doom <em>immediately </em>leaves the swamp when it&#39;s finished, so the base kind of serves as a spot to stop it from leaving towards the past. In that sense, the prison and egg come into play, as the former might impede the heroes and the latter might give an advantage to the villians. In that sense, the outpost does mesh with the rest of the set, but not that much. The main weakness is that there is only one or two places to put minifigures without using all the surrounding studs. So placing <em>three </em>on the structure without resorting to having them stand on leaves or hanging onto bars might be a challange. This makes <em>fighting</em> the Iron Doom from the outpost impractical, as one slash might bring down the whole structure if it wasn&#39;t built as rigidly as it is.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>So, is it worth the money? That depends on what you expect from the set. Do you want a <strong>playset</strong>? You get a reconfigurable and modular base, some goodguys and badguys, and a lot of play features. There is a prison, a breaking egg, and a time traveling mech. If you want it for the mech, I&#39;d ask why? For the <strong>looks</strong>? Then go for it! It looks stunning and looks slightly better in real life than on pictures. Do you want it for the Iron Doom as a <strong>poseable mech</strong>? Then I&#39;d say you shouldn&#39;t expect too much. It&#39;s not unposeable or anything, it&#39;s just very limited. But as this is lego, you are fortunately able to mod it slightly to have a swiveling waist. But I still have to express my disappointment by the poor articulation of the vanilla product. It shouldn&#39;t have been necassary to mod it in the first place for it to compare to similar products.</p>

<p>Finally, I have to admit I was slightly disappointed by the Iron Doom&#39;s size. It&#39;s a bit taller than the Samurai Mech or Ronin M.E.C., but not by a large margin. Those sets also cost 20 euro less. That&#39;s likely because of the inclusion of the outpost. But considering the size of the outpost and factoring in the extra builds for the aforementioned sets, the size isn&#39;t that bad for the price. Actually, it&#39;s a good deal compared to similar sized sets!</p>

<p>I might have been a bit harsh on this set. I want to emphasize that I do like the set, and have grown to appreciate it for what it is. But I have to say that lego can still improve with their sets when looking at this set.</p>

<p>All of that being said, do I recommend it? Yes. I enjoyed this set despite its faults. But still, you have to decide whether you want it yourself! ;)</p>
