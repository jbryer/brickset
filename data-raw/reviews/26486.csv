<p>The box is large, and has a large image of Kai and Nya flying to the Dragon&#39;s Forge, while Ray and Maya cower at the Buffmillion Mech&#39;s feet (or tail, really),and a few plain red snakes slither around in the foreground.</p>

<p>There is one 217- page instruction booklet, which features a page in the back that &nbsp;shows how to &#39;forge&#39; new weapons out of the included weapons&nbsp;, and the standard parts inventory, which takes up 5 pages.</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>The parts come in 10 bags labeled 1-8n</p>

<p>You get 11 2x3 pentagonal tiles in black, 9 red 2x2 angle plates, 10 medium blue 2x2 angle plates, 4 of the new snake head elements, and 2 bigfig&nbsp;arms.</p>

<p><b>Build</b></p>

<p>the build is very enjoyable, and took about 1 hr. total.</p>

<p>Bag 1 builds Skackjaw, Commander Raggmunk, and the Buffmillion&nbsp;warrior.</p>

<p>Bag 2 builds Kai, Nya, and the dragon&#39;s body.</p>

<p>Bag 3 is the dragon&#39;s tail and legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bag 4 finishes the dragon.</p>

<p>Bag 5 builds&nbsp;Ray, Maya, and half the Forge.</p>

<p>Bag 6 builds another half.</p>

<p>Bag 7 &nbsp;builds the chimney and center part.</p>

<p>Bag 8 builds the roof.</p>

<p><b>Minifigs</b></p>

<p>4 of the 6 minifigures in the set are exclusive.</p>

<p>Slackjaw is the most common of the 6, appearing in three sets. He is armed with a large axe, which looks rather unwieldy to me, as the trans-red blade sticks out a bit too far for my taste. He has a double-sided face print hat shows the small snakes twisted into a face, and both sides look suitably gruesome.The torso has bulging armor with snakes spilling out, and is remarkably detailed, with metallic silver detailing, and the legs are designed with the same idea.</p>

<p>Commander Raggmunk&nbsp;only appears in two sets, so is rarer than Slackjaw. I didn&#39;t like Slackjaw&#39;s weapon, but have no such qualms about Raggmunk&#39;s buildable sword element. It features a dual-molded blade in trans-red and gunmetal gray, and a gunmetal gray handle.He has a two-sided head, which can either feature a smile, like in the TV show, or a grimace, and both look pretty good. He has a nice molded helmet and armor, and his legs are like Slackjaw&#39;s, but with orange snakes.</p>

<p>Kai has the same torso and legs as in the Vermillion Attack, plus a black shoulder pad element, and a dual-molded hood in red and dark red.His head has a smirk on one side, and a grimace with orange eyes on the reverse. He is armed with two katanas and the orange reverse time blade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nya is identical to the variant in Samurai VXL, but her head has a second face with gold eyes, and an angry expression. She wears her weapon belts the other way around from Kai, and is armed with 2 katanas.</p>

<p>Maya has a medium-blue and dark blue printed outfit, similar to the 2012 Samurai X torso and leg print. She has either a happy or scared face, and molded black long hair.She&#39;s armed with a staff.</p>

<p>Ray has a dark red apron with a gold dragon motif printed on his torso and legs, and a stereotypical Asian mustache on his two-sided head (calm or terrified), and spiky black hair. He is handcuffed.</p>

<p><b>The Completed Model</b></p>

<p>The dragon is 14 in. long, 9 in, tall, and 16 in. wide. It has some great&nbsp;detailing With angle plates on its back, and lots of transparent red and blue elements, and a Stud-Shooting crossbow, situated behind the rear seat.There is a good amount of space for Kai and Nya to sit Back-to-Back on the seat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The forge is very detailed, and the large windows look awesome! The interior&nbsp;features a living area with a fridge&nbsp;with sushi tile, and a tea table, complete with <i>tatami</i>&nbsp;mats to sit on, and a stickered 2x4 tile rug.The other side features a sharpening wheel, and a bench with a 1x2 Samurai X card (a stickered&nbsp;tile) inside.The center features 2 anvils, and a large fireplace.Under the steps, the Dragon Blade can be placed in a sliding drawer.Putting the blade inside of a tan technic pin and rotating it will cause the fire to move, and the 2x2x3 brick in the chimney rotates, revealing the story of the Fusion Dragon, which can perch on top of it.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>This is a wonderful set, and $80 for 1137 pieces is an uncommonly great price! All the models look wonderful, and the figs are awesome! 5 stars all the way!</p>

"KoolKreeper489","2018-11-24T23:35:24.143Z","Dragon's Forge Review","<p>The&nbsp;Dragon&#39;s Forge set is a great set from the&nbsp;Ninjago theme. It includes the forge, a dragon, the Buffmillion mech, and 6 minifigures. It was released in 2017 for $79.99 and has 1137 pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><strong>Kai-</strong> This version of Kai is in his Hands of Time outfit and looks really good. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Nya-</strong> This version of Nya is also in her Hands of Time outfit and looks great. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Ray-</strong> A nice new minifigure that is Kai and Nya&#39;s&nbsp;father. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Maya-</strong> Good new minifigure that is Kai and Nya&#39;s mother. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Commander Raggmunk-</strong> A great Vermillion commander minifigure with nice printing and great new armor pieces. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Slackjaw-</strong> A good Vermillion minifigure with good printing and nice new helmet piece. 9/10</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The forge looks really good for display and has nice playability. It can open and close and the stairs at the front can lift up to reveal a weapon. There is a gear on the back that can make the fire in the fireplace move and turn a painting that has four&nbsp;stickers on it.&nbsp;The two hammers on the sides can move up and down on an anvil. It includes a lot of weapons in it. The dragon has two&nbsp;heads and looks really good. The jaws on the dragon can open and close and both heads can move up and down. The legs and feet can move and the tails can move and the wings can move around. The dragon has two seats on it and the rear seat has a stud shooter crossbow that can move around. The Buffmillion mech doesn&#39;t look that good but is still ok. It has four snake heads, the arms can move, and the hands can spin around. 9/10</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is great set that has nice minifigures and good builds. This set is great for playability but looks good on display as well. All of the minifigures look great the forge looks good and the dragon is awesome but the mech doesn&#39;t add much to the set. For $79.99 this is a great set that is worth the value.&nbsp;</p>
