<p>Starting off withe U-Wing Pilot, the printing is expansive &amp; from what i remember very movie accurate, well detailed. Its always nice to have a minifigure with waist printing, the double sised face is also very nice, i now have four microfighters &amp; only one without a double sided face! Plus i love the new helmet! It&#39;s very nicely molded, excellent printing, &amp; the trans yellow visor continues to impress!</p>

<p>Now to the fighter itself. A very stocky build (not un-expected), long, not overly wide,&nbsp; &amp; the addition of working S-foils (I wasnt keen on them at first) are very good, along with the front stud shooters all make fora nice vehicle.The Trans black cheese slopes below the shooters only add more to the general look. The engines only further the flow of the vehicle (liking the addition of hollow black studs on the front).&nbsp;Next, the colors (except the yellow) all fit nicely &amp; movie accuracy remains very high. Black (Trans Black), Blue, Light &amp; Dark Grey, White &amp; Trans Orange (except Yellow) &amp; the colors of the pilot make for an impressive palate.</p>

<p>Overall the U-Wing MIcrofighter makes for a very impressive set. Whether your 5, 15, 25 or older, if you like Lego, Star Wars or Lego Star Wars this is something i recommend for any fan. Not to mention a fun (&amp; cheaper) way to acquire a U-Wing Fighter.</p>

"magykfyre","2017-01-15T08:35:58.953Z","Amazing Minifigure...","<p>I should begin this review with the disclaimer that this is my first microfighter. I also bought this with a slight discount in Japan - the actual price in Australia, where I live, is $16 (12USD) - not a particularly great price if you just want the minifigure. Despite the caution I had in buying a set that I only really felt interested in because of its sole minifigure, I was happy to find that the model itself was cute, fun and not bad for display either.</p>

<h3><strong style=""font-family: &quot;Museo Slab&quot;, Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Minifigure</strong></h3>

<p>I will admit that I originally bought&nbsp;this set for the minifigure alone. The official review has large images of this amazing figure so I won&#39;t bore you with a rehash or description, but something that I did find pleasantly surprising was that the helmet with the separately molded visor was not actually a&nbsp;re-colour of the Resistance X Wing pilots, but a new mold. As far as I know this element is exclusive to the set but hopefully more, differently decorated versions will come along.</p>

<h3><strong>Build</strong></h3>

<p>The build is fairly straightforward and easy to follow, and it&#39;s mostly just plate stacking. There are some of those nice new(?) 2x1 curvy slopes and corresponding boat hull shapes, as well as five of the newish studs with holes.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Result</strong></h3>

<p>The chibi style of the series had me a little apprehensive but this set&nbsp;renders a surprising resemblance to the actual ship!</p>

<p>There are no odd coloured parts that are partially visible as they sometimes are in Lego sets, except a bit of yellow on the bottom (I just checked and this is mentioned in the official Brickset review, but it doesn&#39;t stick out and I personally didn&#39;t find it particularly jarring considering that the U-Wing does have some yellow markings in the film.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>My one other issue is that during the build process (before the four thrusters at the back are built), I had fun sweeping the wings back to form a sleek, aerodynamic silhouette. However, once the four thrusters and their mounts are attached, the wings cannot be fully pushed back and the V-shape becomes a lot fatter&nbsp;- it takes on more of a Milano-From-Guardians-Of-The-Galaxy appearance. However, this might just be the microfighter style that I&#39;m not used to but I definitely think the wings-facing-forward version looks more recognisable as a U-Wing.</p>

<h3><strong>Summary</strong></h3>

<p>I can definitely say that my scepticism of Microfighters has been tempered by the incredibly detailed minifigure and - despite its flaws - the cute and mostly recognisable U-Wing model. I highly recommend it for Microfighter fans and&nbsp;sceptics, and Rogue One fans alike.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-10-07T02:34:36.687Z","The U-Wing is a great Microfighter","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #75160 U-Wing Microfighter:</b> I haven&rsquo;t built or reviewed one of these things in a long while. Microfighters are extremely impressive little toys, but sometimes they can suffer a bit for the cutesy design. That isn&rsquo;t the case here, however it isn&rsquo;t exactly easy to find at retail any more.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Rebel U-Wing Pilot: Although not a named character from the Rogue One movie this Minifigure goes a long way to look really impressive. You&rsquo;ll find that the print detailing is extremely well done, his torso features a lot of detailing for the typical Rebel era flight suits. This character is dressed in a dark blue number with vest and belt detailing on the legs and torso is a nice contrasting dark tannish colour.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">His pistol is not unique, in fact most of the Microfighter Pilots use this smaller pistol for battling, his helmet is the newer sculpted element with a clear visor in the front which covers the eyes. His head has a smirking expression on one side and a yelling/teeth gritting expression on the other. The helmet has a lot of great details in the markings and sculpt. Highly impressive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The Microfighter &amp; build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The U-Wing as a ship is a rather large vehicle, more of a light support craft than a Starfighter, but it&rsquo;s rugged and versatile enough to pull off double duty. It actually makes me think that this was the Rebellion&rsquo;s attempt at making an upgrade to the Republic era Clone Gunships, with the sweeping wing design and the capability to transport ground forces into battle.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This Microfighter as a build is tons of fun, though slightly reminiscent of Microfighter X-Wing builds for the rear wing assembly. Two stud shooters are featured predominantly in the front for play, while the overall design is a squat little craft excellent for sweeping through the skies battling fellow Microfighters, or racing them. The front &lsquo;wings&rsquo; can move backwards to create a swept back appearance, or remain facing the proper way to capture the look seen most on screen in Rogue One.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Microfighters are fun enjoyable side-models to build when you feel the urge to create an army of racer sized ships. The larger, better proportioned models are for the folks looking to get screen accurate representations. These sets are more for the younger crowd who want to have something easier to hold when playing, so you can have two ships, one in either hand, while dogfighting or the like.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Series 4 featured less ships than Series 1-3, in the past we had six releases at once, with Series 4 LEGO only gave us four ships. If you can find it still at retail I&rsquo;d recommend picking it up. Recommended.</p>

"Japanbuilder","2017-05-04T09:57:25.68Z","It's all in the helmet!","<p>With the release of Rogue One on home formats why not take a peek at some of the associated sets from LEGO. Today we will look at the microfighter&nbsp;of the U-Wing, the film&#39;s most iconic ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Packaging and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The packaging is great both front and back and shows off our vessel in action against the empire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside we will find a couple of bags and a manual.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts are great we get 4 all white LEGO figure heads which could prove useful for other custom figures. We also get four 1x1 black studs with a hole through the center. The rest of the parts are fairly common but useful for many themes beyond Star Wars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your spare parts will consist of these when you are done.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>The real draw to this set is going to be the minifigure. It has wonderful prints front and back and comes with a dual sided face. The face is very useful with a confident smile and his attack face. But trumping all of this is the helmet for our pilot. It is dual molded with fantastic prints. The detail on this thing is amazing. We get the phoenix logo front and center of the helmet and despite the size of everything the printing is crisp and clear.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Set:</strong></p>

<p>The finished model looks pretty good. Despite its size the designer/s of the set really captured the major points of the build. The wings sweep forward and back and the underside has some clear pieces to simulate the look of the bigger model. We get two stud shooters and they fit in very well with the set. The whole thing is actually not that small for a microfighter&nbsp;but also it looks pretty sleek, specially with the figure removed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>The real draw is the pilot with his helmet. The helmet alone remains exclusive to&nbsp;this set but considering the entire package is full of useful parts it is certainly worth the expense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For fans of microfighters&nbsp;the set is an absolute must buy. For customizers the parts are well worth the price of admission and that helmet is stellar, hands down.&nbsp;</p>
