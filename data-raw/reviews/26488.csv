<p>I have collected a couple of the microfighters&nbsp;since 2014, but usually due to the minifigure being one of value, or that I wanted for my collection. For example, the 75028 Clone Turbo Tank had that incredibly desirable clean clone, and so I picked up a few of them. However the 75074 Snowspeeder&nbsp;was one of the first that caught my eye for the design. It looked great, I thought, and so I picked it up. The same goes for this. I had already bought the full 75154 TIE Striker, so I already had the minifigure, but i thought the design looked great.</p>

<p><strong>Box and Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Pretty standard for microfighters, with a small square box that has only a silver logo, rather than the full banner art that changes every year on regular Star Wars sets, and advertising for only the other microfighters, and a Series 4 logo at the bottom.</p>

<p>The instructions are very normal small instructions, with one page of advertising for other microfighters.</p>

<p><strong>Auxiliaries</strong></p>

<p>There is only the one minifigure that comes with a small blaster pistol. It is the same as from the 75154 TIE Striker, so is nice to get much cheaper. The helmet has excellent detail, and I especially like the 2 silver stripes going down the centre. The torso is very detailed, and the leg printing fits well with the figure, and is not jarring.</p>

<p>The only problems I have with the figure are the lack of exclusivity to it, although it is luckily a massable figure, and the head is your &#39;angry clone&#39; face that has appeared on ever stormtrooper and clone trooper spanning all 3 eras of Star Wars since 2014. Rather unimaginative.</p>

<p><strong>TIE Striker</strong></p>

<p>The build is a relatively simple one, but not tedious, and it all fits together nicely. I like the build of the wings, particularly the light gray modified 2x2 plate that acts as a stopper when you fold the wings up. This allows for an easy and pretty perfect mechanism of putting the wings in landing or flight mode. The model looks pretty chubby, as the fuselage is rather larger in proportion to the wings than the actual TIE Striker model (both in real life and in Lego), but I fell that rather adds to the idea of a &#39;micro&#39; fighter, and it looks quite cute.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it still captures the look of the TIE Striker, just losing a little of its menace. But it still looks pretty good displayed!</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Overall, this is a pretty good little microfighter! The figure is very good, just a little common, but a fun build and really easy to play with for the kids. For me, it&#39;s great, as I actually move around quite a lot through the country, so I can have the full size TIE Striker in one place, and this in the other, and it still looks good! However, it isn&#39;t a stand out set, so if you&#39;re indifferent towards the figure or the ship within the Star Wars universe, you will&nbsp;not be amazed by it.</p>

<p>It has (here in the UK) the RRP of&nbsp;&pound;8.99, which is a pretty good price for what you&#39;re getting, and seems reasonable for kids who may get weekly pocket money to save up for a few weeks and buy it themselves. I like the idea of that a lot!</p>
