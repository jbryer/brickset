To continue my own theme of reviewing the Y-Wing sets I own, here is a quick glance at the smallest one in the family.</p>

<p><strong>Figure</strong></p>

<p>Microfighters have a good habit at releasing exclusive or hard to find figures in small inexpensive sets; and this Y-Wing pilot is no exception. His torso and body prints are identical to the U-Wing/Y-Wing pilot in the bigger Y-Wing set. However what sets the figure apart is his unique helmet. The printing is detailed on this one, with detail on the front and the sides. Part of what makes the helmet stand out though is the starbird variant on the front of the helmet, which is based on the starbird&nbsp;graffiti drawn by Sabine Wren in the Rebels cartoon.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Finished Model</b></p>

<p>Like the other Microfighter&#39;s; there is a squashed &quot;chibi&quot; aspect to the model. The shape looks like a fairly cute and exaggerated version of the iconic craft. Most of the critical details are there though, with the built up cowled cockpit with twin chin cannons and a turret mounted blaster; and the twin engine nacelles. One detriment to the finished model though is the lack of any piece to represent the Astromech co-navigator. However Astromech fans will be happy to see the small body used in the Chopper figure are made available in this set in plain light gray and yellow; offering some base bricks to make a custom figure with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Probably my least favorite part of the model are the twin flick fire missiles mounted on the sides of the pilot. I know there must be some mandate that all Microfighters include either stud shooters or flick fires for play value, but I wish the more reliable stud shooters or spring loaded missiles had been chosen for this toy instead of the older flick fires.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Closing</strong></p>

<p>This kit stands out in the current Microfighter&#39;s range. It makes a good compliment to the larger Y-Wing set currently available, offering a pilot variant for the larger set. It also offers a low priced alternative to fans who want a Y-Wing or a Rogue One styled pilot figure.&nbsp;</p>

It&rsquo;s nice to have a Y-Wing to put next to X-Wing from Series 1, though if I&rsquo;m not mistaken this ship was also used as a Microfighter design in the Build Your Own Adventure book from DK, though as I have yet to pick it up I&rsquo;m not 100% sure on that or if the model itself is re-used or brand new.</span></span></span></span></p>

His head is dual-sided with two different expressions, one happy the other howling in rage, his helmet has some nice markings on it as well and he&rsquo;s carrying the small blaster. A great little figure.</span></span></span></span></p>

Seriously it is a fun little snub-nosed looking ship with placement of Flick-Fire Missiles not interfering the overall design of the model, the build is quick and fun and as a bonus a Jumper plate is used to store the Blaster accessory in the back where the Ion Cannon would normally go, though they also build up a section on the back with two white telescope pieces which are probably meant to be said Ion Cannon.</span></span></span></span></p>
