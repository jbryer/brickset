<p><strong>Packaging and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The packaging is simple and depicts the microfighter in flight. The front and back are attractive enough though the setting feels very plain for this particular package.</p>

<p>Mostly the parts come in black and include things like&nbsp;corner slopes, wing pieces, hinge pieces and stud shooters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside you will find&nbsp;a manual and 2 bags.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>An Imperial Pilot is included in this set, however, his printing (aside from his belt buckle) is identical to that of the Imperial Technician in the Galactic Empire Battlepack from 2016 even the face is the same. The only difference is that this guy is in all black flight officer garb.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still he looks the part of an imperial navy crew member and I like him.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The build and completed set:</strong></p>

<p>The build is simple but effective. The shuttle looks the part. Even the wings can be folded&nbsp;up and down. If you love the microfighter lines you will not be disappointed by the entry of this vessel into your collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was mostly drawn to it for the figure as I have very few Imperial Navy personnel in my collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>A decent model to be sure. The parts included in all black are very useful indeed. But the pilot is the highlight for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The play value is rather poor on this set without its adversary set on hand, sadly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would only encourage picking it up if you can find it a less than retail as overall it is not quite as striking as other models in the line. If, however, you need personnel for your imperials then this set is a must as it is very good to get a flight officer in standard imperial black with cap.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"FowlerBricks","2018-05-05T22:12:23.65Z","An unexpected gem in the Microfighters line","<p>This is my third Microfighter and it&#39;s actually not one I had planned on getting. It just didn&#39;t really catch my eye. So here&#39;s how I got it: I signed up to be part of the 2017 Brickset Secret Santa, but something went wrong and the person who was supposed to be my Santa never sent anything. Then the admin jumped in and took the place of my Santa, sending me a 60149 4x4 with catamaran and Krennic&#39;s shuttle Microfighter and I realized that I had almost missed out on a great Microfighter! So a huge thanks to the admin! Let&#39;s dive in!</p>

<p>THE BOX AND INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<p><br />
I actually find the box to be pretty funny. Krennic&#39;s chibi shuttle is flying through a ridiculous amount of explosions with the pilot perched stoically on top. This is made even funnier by the fact that there is normal TIE Fighters and an X-Wing in the background.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/p61jsh5ib/Box.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>A planet, which I assume is Scarif, looms in one corner. The top of the box identifies the minifigure as &quot;Imperial Shuttle Pilot.&quot; The back of the box shows the shuttle landed on Scarif and the pilot is shooting his tiny blaster pistol at a Y-Wing. The Y-Wing pilot is apparently so terrified of being shot at that he&#39;s jumping out of his ship before the laser blast has even reached him.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/8ia1q40hv/Box_Back.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>I guess Microfighters don&#39;t have shields? Or maybe the pilot forgot about them. Not such a great pilot. That doesn&#39;t speak well of the rebels. Off to the left, you can see two panels showing off the shuttle&#39;s features: shooting cannons and folding wings. All of Series 4 is shown down below, with blue lighting up the shuttle since its, you know, the one in the box. The box is the dreaded push tab type. The instructions are pretty standard. One more kind of random thing about the box: Series 4 is written in four different languages while Microfighters is only written in one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE BUILD</p>

<p><br />
Quick and easy but fun, like most Microfighters. A few clever building techniques are used, but nothing to complex.</p>

<p>THE MINIFIGURE</p>

<p><br />
The shuttle pilot is the sole minifigure included in the set. I found out through Jangbrick&#39;s review that an almost identical figure was included in the Series 1 Star Destroyer. The only difference is the hat. Since I don&#39;t have the Star Destroyer, that doesn&#39;t matter that much to me. Plus, you can never have too many Imperial Crew members.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/hq2a6xa5v/Pilot.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/ota5mg7ur/Pilot_Back.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The torso and legs have excellent printing with a ton of detail. The pilot is dressed in a somewhat rumpled uniform and Lego has done a great job making it seem like there&#39;s actually wrinkles and rumples on the plastic. The pilot&#39;s face is nothing new, but hey, it&#39;s not angry clone! And it&#39;s a great generic flesh colored head that can be used almost anywhere.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/495bnzuoj/Pilot_head.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The hat is a pretty recent mold and it&#39;s also somewhat rare as it has only appeared in three sets, one of which is the Death Star. It has one small bit of printing that shows a small silver disc. Overall, this is an excellent minifigure and getting a couple of them wouldn&#39;t be a bad thing in, my opinion.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/amuera25f/Pilot_with_Blaster.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;THE COMPLETED MODEL</p>

<p><br />
The finished shuttle is actually a lot cooler than it looked on the box. Lego has captured the pyramid-esque shape of Krennic&#39;s shuttle quite well here. I&#39;m not sure why they added that bit of trans-red on the front or even what it&#39;s supposed to represent, but it looks cool, so I&#39;ll let it slide.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/trxo19m0z/Shuttle.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The underside looks slightly odd, with the sides lower than the middle. However, a quick Google search revealed the the &#39;real&#39; shuttle is just like that, but with a little bit more geometric shaping that would have been nearly impossible to achieve at this scale.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/d465yqooj/Shuttle_Underside.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The large upper fin is comically small, not even reaching past the seated pilot&#39;s head. I find it strange that Lego left the tip of the fin without anything on it. A 1x1 black tile would remedy that, or you could use the 1x1 black slope that&#39;s included as an extra.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/8v1fwl8kj/Shuttle_With_Pilot.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>There are two stud shooters in the front and a laser cannon on each wingtip. I feel that the wingtip cannons would benefit from another 1x1 slope each, set behind them. There&#39;s the engines and some nice vent-like detail on the back. All that looks great and keeps the ship from having a camera unfriendly angle.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/vjqmw2pxf/Shuttle_Back.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The wings can fold into landed position which is an essential feature that it works perfectly. The pilot can still sit with the wings folded, which is great plus it gives him somewhere to go when it&#39;s raining (on Scarif that is, not in space. Everyone knows it doesn&#39;t rain in space).</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/v6z8pys8z/Shuttle_Wings_folded.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/kwwtqqa37/Shuttle_With_Pilot_FW.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The pilot is only attached by two studs, so you can easily remove him. The windshield on this one is a far cry from the Wookie Gunship. It&#39;s more for looks than offering any protection.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/xbjlr045f/Shuttle_Tilted.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p><br />
OVERALL</p>

<p><br />
What an excellent set! And to think I almost missed out on it! Lego has done this Microfighter right, bar a few small flaws. It looks even better next to the large version of the the shuttle. Kids and adults alike can have a lot of fun swooshing this one around.</p>
