<p>This is one of my favorite sets to date, and definitely a highlight in the sets in this price range. Also, this is one of the two sets that I have ever bought for its full price. It&#39;s all about the minifigs in this one, but that is somewhat the norm in this type of sets.</p>

<h3>Box and instructions</h3>

<p>Very nice images on the box, almost doing justice to the set. Instruction booklet folded in two, which I find quite annoying given the fact that the box is big enough for it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing special, but a really nice color scheme. Some of the earth green and sand yellow pieces seem to be not that common.&nbsp;Also, a bunch of transparent red round plates and a total of 5 shooters - four&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6051331"">6051331</a>&nbsp;(typical for such Star Wars sets)&nbsp;and one&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6102734"">6102734</a>. A few more pieces than the typical battle pack.</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>Now we&#39;re talking. This is what this&nbsp;set is all about. Unlike most &quot;4 minifigs and a small build&quot; Star Wars sets, this one has a really strong minifig selection. Each minifig&nbsp;has a unique head and torso, two have repeating legs and helmets, while the other two have the same type of helmet, but with different color.</p>

<p>Overall, the minifigs really portray the ragtag rebels we saw in Rogue One.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but compare the minifigs&nbsp;favorably&nbsp;to the ones in&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75133-1/Rebel-Alliance-Battle-Pack"">75133</a>, where the bodies are the four combinations of two types of legs and torsos, and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75088-1/Senate-Commando-Troopers"">75088</a>,&nbsp;where there are practically only two different minifigs.&nbsp;Still, those two sets are also really nice, and also have a strong minifig selection compared to most others.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>An unsurprisingly short build typical for this type of sets. I&#39;m pretty certain that I took more time assembling the minifigs, than building the speeder and the cannon, but that is because as I said - the minifigs are great.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The speeder is actually quite nice&nbsp;and, although simpler and smaller, looks somewhat&nbsp;better than the one in&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75133-1/Rebel-Alliance-Battle-Pack"">75133</a>. But again, this set is all about the minifigs.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A really nice set, with a great selection of minifigs, which can be used in projects unrelated to Star Wars. Additionally, we get a fair amount of parts in a great color scheme and/or a cool speeder - without a doubt a fair deal for the price of the set.</p>

<p>I would definitely recommend this set.</p>

<p>The Packaging is very simple with the lovely Rogue One box art. Inside the parts are distributed in two small bags.</p>

<p>The Build</p>

<p>The build was very fast and simple without a lot of technical building. There was also very little symmetry which made it a very exciting build.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This set contains some parts in rarer colors such as the &quot;A-Bracket&quot; in dark bluish grey, 2x2x2/3 modified tiles in dark green,&nbsp;2x2 inverted tiles in light bluish grey, and the rebel helmet in dark bluish grey.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are no new parts in this set, yet the parts you get come in a wide variety and are very useful for MOCs.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>All four minifigures are exclusive to this set. Unfortunately&nbsp;many of them use pieces from other minifigures such as the use of Snap Wexley&#39;s&nbsp;head from The Force Awakens. Many of the prints are also repeated in this set just on different colors of parts. I don&#39;t mind this so much as it makes it easy to customize the figures if you get multiples of this set. I wish there was more diversity as there are no female minifigures in this set. Also they have stud shooters, so that&#39;s unfortunate.</p>

<p>The Set</p>

<p>The speeder is very nice and for once we get a speeder that feels minifigure&nbsp;scale. It&#39;s simple, yet stylish and looks good on it&#39;s own or as part of a MOC.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The turret makes good use of the stud shooter on top to add playability to this set. It, like the speeder looks very good compared to previous battle pack builds. It also doesn&#39;t overdo the stud shooters so it still maintains a very realistic look. Unfortunately&nbsp;it is difficult to get a minifigure to pose behind the cannon with him holding the handle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>Overall I still think this is one of LEGO&#39;s best battle packs and in my opinion&nbsp;is superior to the Imperial Walker Battle Pack. All the minifigures are good army builders and the builds look good on display. I would highly recommend you pick this set up as an add on to any Rogue One set especially if you are in need of some rebel troopers.</p>

"Michel_Ange","2018-02-20T23:56:01.377Z","More than a simple battlepack","<p>The two builds make excellent use of a very interesting parts selection, full of dark tan and dark green in nice shapes.</p>

<p>Being smaller than usual doesn&#39;t impair the speeders fast and aggressive look, thanks to a clever design that makes the most of every part.</p>

<p>In the same way, the trench feels more extensive than expected from a battle pack ornament, and the rotary cannon has a very convincing way of swaying around.</p>

<p>The figs offer impressively fine and detailed printings ; they accomplish the feat of giving a very unified feeling, and yet the designs and colors are very diversified.</p>

<p>Definitely one of the best battle packs I&#39;ve seen.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-07T21:55:48.32Z","A Great Rebel Army builder","<p>The troops in this are really good and really give off the vibe of no uniform and that raggedy/ ragtag feel that the rebels are known for. The speeder in this is a solid build and does not have pieces fall off of it. The gunner emplacement is really nice as well and is great for the terrain pieces that are part of that spot. The soldiers can also be taken apart and mixed and matched with each other so that they don&#39;t all look the same. Other than that I would highly recommend picking this up if you want to make targets for your stormtroopers to go up against, or buy multiples and put them in a base. This truly is a good rebel army builder.</p>
