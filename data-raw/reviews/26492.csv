<p><strong>Packaging and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The front and back covers depict our troopers in action in some world controlled by the Empire. Their walker is being used as support in their assault and it is very attractive overall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts are the usual fare for a battle pack lots of stud blasters and fairly common parts but in grey and dark bluish grey. You will have lots of 1x1 pieces left over when finished.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>As with all battlepacks this one is desired for the figures and boy do they deliver the goods! The new Death Troopers are excellently represented here with very detailed printing and their helmets are great piece of molding! They look great!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The regular stormtroopers are identical to the one found in the 2016 Star Wars Advent Calendar. Though they differ in color slightly from the ones found in the Galactic Empire Battlepack released early in 2016. Those troopers are a bit more white while these are a bit more cream white.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are no double faces on any of them and they are sporting the standard angry clone trooper face.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The build and completed set:</strong></p>

<p>The build was simple but it is for sure meant to be purchased with its counterpart set for the rebels. The walker looks awkward to me but slightly better than the small Microfighters AT-DP. Overall not bad but the figures are the draw here the build is just bonus but still fun. I like the cannons on the side of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>I love this pack. If you are looking for troopers then this is the pack for you. The Deathtroopers fit in just fine with their brothers and certainly enhance the imperial presence wherever they are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For play it is not very good as a stand-alone set. It feels like you may be force to getting&nbsp;an opposing set with this set or sometime later if you don&#39;t have any rebels in your collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not a bad entry in the line despite it is short play value.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Optional Customizations:</strong></p>

<p>If you have some spare blasters and some black technic joints you can make some cool alterations to this set to make the troopers&nbsp;seem more like they do in the movies. Additionally if you have an AT-DP driver or any other imperial driver you can use it to free up one of your troopers in the pack for battle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>May the force be with the rebels as you assault their positions with these fine troopers!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fact is, the minifigures&nbsp;of this set are incredible. Lego has gotten very, very good at what they do, and the printing, particularly on the death troopers, is both accurate and beautiful. The Death Trooper helmets are a new design, and are very cool. The Stormtroopers&nbsp;look better than ever before, but the fact that they have changed the design again (if ever so slightly) may annoy some people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>When I saw the image of the build on the box I was frankly not excited. It looked weird and not at all like anything in the Empire&#39;s unique style. After i built it, however, I was pleasantly surprised, particularly&nbsp;after acquiring two sets; the walkers look very good next to each other, as if on patrol.</p>

<p>Final Verdict:</p>

<p>This is a must have for any fan of Star Wars, in particular. Rogue One, if only for the absolutely stunning minifigures, which, lets be honest, is the only reason why anyone buys battlepacks in the first place.</p>

"FowlerBricks","2018-02-01T01:40:34.03Z","Death Troopers: Yes! Stormtroopers: Yes! Funky Walker: Err...","<p>With the semi-recent release of Rogue One, Lego has put out an array of sets based on the movie. There were two Battle Packs amongst them and today you will witness the power of the Dark Side in my review of the Imperial Troopers Battle Pack&hellip;or will you? Does this set truly display the might of the Empire or not? Read on and you will see.</p>

<p><br />
FOR STARTERS</p>

<p><br />
Before I get into the actual review, I&rsquo;d like to give a little history of the Battle Packs. The first ones were 7655&nbsp;Clone Trooper Battle Pack (not to be confused with the Clone Troopers Battle Pack) and&nbsp;7654&nbsp;Droids Battle Pack. These came out in 2007. The next wave came the next year and battle packs have continued to be released up to this year, giving us many ways to build decent armies for fairly cheap. There were a few thrown in the mix that had two heroes and two villains but these didn&#39;t&nbsp;seem to be as popular, making them disappear quickly. I can see why. Having two good guys and two bad guys makes it hard to build an army because you have to buy twice as many sets. Now, onward!</p>

<p><br />
THE BOX AND INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<p><br />
The box uses the same design as the other Rogue One sets, displaying a Death Trooper against a ragged denim looking background in the top right corner and the Imperials and their walker front and center charging into battle on what appears to be Jedha.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/qmeafmg9v/Box-_Front.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The back of the box shows a different angle of the set plus the few play features. It also appears that the Troopers are no longer on Jedha.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/3wf5n6mxv/Box-_Back.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The Instructions are standard Lego fare with the same design as the box.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/p7cpqxphf/Instructions.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>In the back of the Instructions there is a neat little set/minifigure display along with an advertisement for the Force Builder app.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/8jl7oga5f/Instructions-_Open.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p><br />
THE MINIFIGURES</p>

<p><br />
This is obviously the main draw of the set. The Minifigures are what makes a Battle Pack&hellip;or breaks it. Fortunately this set has a pretty solid offering. Two Death Troopers plus two Stormtroopers. The Death Troopers are slightly different from the ones included in Krennic&rsquo;s shuttle. The helmets, legs and heads are the same but the pauldron is absent and the torso print is different, making these normal Death Troopers (if you can call Death Troopers normal) instead of specialists.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/vjrv18xtv/Deathtrooper_Better_Version.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 508px;"" /></p>

<p>This is a nice change since it makes army building easier (the whole point of the set). These are excellent minifigures. The helmet is accurately molded with dark bluish gray detail and two tiny splashes of green plus some shiny silver vents on the vocoder. The silver and gray detail continues on the torso (front and back) and down to the legs.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/3jnrgyexv/Deathtrooper_W_out_helmet.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 503px;"" /></p>

<p>And yes, the heads are just angry clone again but you&rsquo;re supposed to keep the helmet on, so I won&rsquo;t complain. All the prints on the body and legs are clean and crisp, but I noticed the lines on one of my Death Trooper&rsquo;s helmets were&nbsp;thicker and slightly smudged. It is&nbsp;easily overlooked, though and I am quite satisfied with them. Both Death Troopers come equipped with stud shooters. This is not a movie accurate gun, though it does add some play value. A more accurate blaster can be built with a standard long blaster rifle and a Black Technic peg, if you wish.</p>

<p>Next we have the two Stormtroopers. They&rsquo;re nothing special, just the current Stormtrooper design (which I am a huge fan of, by the way), but hey, you can never have too many Stormtroopers right?&nbsp;They also come with stud blasters.</p>

<p><br />
THE PARTS</p>

<p><br />
Nothing too eye-catching. five smooth slopes (Plate W. Bow 2x2x2/3) in light grey plus some stud shooters and a smattering of dark tan 1x2 plates.</p>

<p><br />
THE BUILD</p>

<p><br />
A nice mix of simple stacking and a tiny bit of SNOT. Easy to understand, so even younger kids could probably build it pretty quickly.</p>

<p><br />
THE COMPLETED MODEL</p>

<p><br />
I honestly don&rsquo;t know what to think about this walker. There are some aspects of it that I really like: the elevating guns, the design of the body, the color scheme, the spot to store the pilot&rsquo;s blaster and the legs have a fairly wide range of movement.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/exaarq9wj/Walker-_Front.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 466px;"" /></p>

<p>There are also some aspects that I really don&rsquo;t like: the pilot sits up way too high. The windscreen is useless.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/vl1su6783/Walker_W_Stormtrooper.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Any sniper worth his Tibanna gas could take out the pilot without even breaking a sweat.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/j6f0tx80z/Walker-_Useless_Windscreen.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The legs of the walker are rather skinny and void of detail and the feet are too small, making it near impossible&nbsp;to pose the walker without it falling over.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/x03diz8c3/Walker-_Front_and_Side.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>There are also some strange gaps in the front that could have easily been blocked up by adding two more 1x2 plates.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/klglimlyr/Walker-_Swivel_Guns.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>It does look better in real life than it does on the box, though. It looks horrible on the box, so don&rsquo;t judge it by that picture. I don&rsquo;t recall seeing any walkers like this in Rogue One, but maybe it&rsquo;s a Battlefront thing or maybe Lego just made it up for the set. Either way, you have to form your own opinion. Kids will probably love it and not care how it looks, just that it shoots. AFOL&rsquo;s&hellip;maybe not so much.</p>

On the whole, this set is excellent, but that&rsquo;s mainly because it&rsquo;s a cheap way to obtain some Death Troopers and extra Stormtroopers. The Walker&rsquo;s guns certainly look intimidating, but if I were a Rebel, I&rsquo;d just laugh and shoot the Stormtrooper off the top of the thing. $15 seems slightly pricey, not too bad but you may want to wait for a sale anyhow. I definitely recommend that you pick up a few, but&hellip;I won&rsquo;t judge you if you never build the walker. So maybe this set doesn&#39;t display the full might of the Empire, but it does pretty well despite some large flaws.</p>

<p>Its not a huge set, but it is a tremendous value and a lot of fun to play with. When combined with other Star Wars sets, it really gives you a very good sized imperial army. Easily the best Star Wars set for pre-schoolers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Death troopers x2: I love the Death trooper design in the movie Rogue One, and I&#39;m glad to get two of these figures in an inexpensive set. The unique helmet mould looks ok although I feel it juts out a bit too far. The print on the helmet is great however. Both minifigures have the angry clone face print; I would rather they each had different expressions. The torso and legs have fantastic prints. Each trooper carries a stud shooter which is good for play although I&#39;d prefer they had realistic blasters.</p>

<p>Stormtroopers x2: I like getting standard troopers in battlepacks. The Stormtrooper&#39;s helmets look perfect including both the print and the mould. Sadly, these troopers also have angry clone faces. The simple torso prints show the appropriate armour and the legs have a great print with lots of detail. They also carry stud shooters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Set&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Lego Star Wars battlepacks often include actual Star Wars vehicles but in this case a custom walker was created. The body of the walker is designed to fit a single pilot. I like the inclusion of a small clip on the back to store the troopers weapon while he rides the walker. Two canons on the sides can be angled 360 degrees and feature stud shooters. The legs have three points of articulation and can pose fairly well. I personally dislike the look of the walker, and would have preferred an actual Star Wars vehicle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
The minifigures are the highlight of all battlepacks and all four figures look fantastic. Despite the fact I dislike the main build, it still plays well. $23 aud is the standard price for a battlepack and I definitely recommend this set.&nbsp;</p>

"Captainfives1514","2022-12-24T18:42:09.273Z","Stormtroopers Strike Back!","<p>&nbsp; I did not get this set the year it was released. I got the set for Christmas one year after it had been discontinued during the Covid lock down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; The Minifigures in this set are perfect for army building. To start off with you have two Death Troopers. The helmet is a special mould with gay printing and green accents on the breathing filters. Their torsos are printed with grey accents as well as their legs. Their armed with stud shooters.</p>

<p>&nbsp; There is also included two pre2019 stormtroopers. Their helmets are printed with black markings and blue and grey highlights. Their torsos and legs have armour printing on them. They are also armed with stud shooters.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The build in this set is a LEGO made up Walker entirely for this set. It has moving legs and several adjustable turrets on the side. The pilot is exposed and there is a clip for the troopers stud shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; Overall the Minifigures are definitely the highlight of this set. The Walker is arguably one of the weakest LEGO models in an official set I have ever seen. I would definitely recommend this set,&nbsp;if you could even find it for a decent price.</p>
