He&#39;s a bright cookie and has been building from instructions for well over a year and he spent a good 3-4 hours building this with just a few little errors en route (wouldv&#39;e taken me 20 minutes at most, but far more pleasure watching him build it.) With no Yoda in our collection, this was an obvious buy.</p>

<p>we love the colours, the build is very solid, much moreso than Anakin&#39;s&nbsp;jedi interceptor (75038)&nbsp;which is his favourite.</p>

<p>The model inside will only properly fit a minifigure with &#39;child&#39;s&#39; legs as Yoda has, although you can fit a full sized minifigure in if you bend him forwards rather than sit him down.</p>

<p>The model actually reminds me of a mini tie interceptor (which given the developmernt of tie fighters from the jedi interceptor in SW lore I &nbsp;guess makes sense.</p>

<p>The six stickers add a nice touch, but I know Yoda uses the force and all, but why on earth no control panel or flight stick at all? Bad show LEGO. the design lends itself perfectly to a 2x2 curved slope with a sticker on it or a 2x1 printed control panal or even a 2x1&nbsp;x 2/3 slope with sticker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>last comment - why do lego&nbsp;always seem to use RED for their little technic&nbsp;2long axles when black would be much more discrete colour.</p>

<p>but with those two gripes aside, a lovely little model</p>

<p>I have modded the underneath rear (there is a perfect spot by swapping the&nbsp;2x4 plate around with the 2x3 plate underneath) to&nbsp;add a small horizontal u-clip so yoda has a safe place to keep his light-sabre when flying. it may not be &#39;realistic&#39; but will save it getting lost as the kids play with it and it doesn&#39;t look awful, only visible from behind.</p>

<p>the other thing to note is - yet another R2-D2 - I think i have 5 now...........</p>

<p>all in all a pretty good small model that will get lots of play. actually one of the better models out of the new sets from what i&#39;ve&nbsp;seen so far.</p>

"TK_1308","2017-01-05T18:04:36.96Z","""The place Qui-Gon spoke of, I believe this is.""","<p>Lego continues releases from Star Wars: The Clone Wars with Yoda&#39;s Jedi Starfighter from the final story arc of series 6.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>The standard small rectangular kit box for sets in this price range. Yoda is the figure of choice on the top.&nbsp;<br />
The front of the box shows the ship in a combat situation over a planet. The back shows the ship landed on a planet with Yoda and R2-D2. There are 4 panels showing the play features of the ship.<br />
There is one small rectangular instruction book.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts<br />
The price per piece ratio is average for a kit this size. The pieces are primarily grey and black with some nice dark green for detailing. Also a nice selection of curved plates and bricks in the set.<br />
There are 3 bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains parts for the lower primary hull and Yoda.<br />
Bag 2 contains parts for the forward and upper primary hull structure and R2-D2.<br />
Bag 3 contains parts for the wing assemblies.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The set comes with two minifigures.<br />
R2-D2 is nothing special in itself as he has been released countless times. That said, the detailing on his body and dome are nicely done.<br />
Yoda is nicely realised in minifigure form. The detailing on his molded head piece is great, right down to the grey hair on the back of his head and the expression in his eyes. His tunic is simply detailed and he has the short legs for accuracy. He comes armed with his green lightsaber.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Total building time, 15 minutes.<br />
After having several Eta-2 Actis Class Light Interceptors to date, the design of Yoda&#39;s personal modified starfighter is refreshingly different. While retaining the same basic design, there are enough variations to make the builder realise that this isn&#39;t just the same old fighter once again.<br />
The designer has done a great job of making this look like it&#39;s on-screen counterpart, utilising S.N.O.T. techniques and Technic pieces to get the correct angles and curves plus packed the standard features package into a vehicle this small.<br />
There are six stickers to apply. Two are for the aft thrusters, two for the Republic markings on the cockpit and two for the markings on the upper wings.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Yoda&#39;s Jedi starfighter is a great little craft and one of my favourite Eta-2 Actis class fighters to date. The ship is very solid and flyable and looks great in both flight and landed modes.<br />
The cockpit viewing portal hinges downwards and the canopy hinges upward to allow access for Yoda to stand inside.<br />
There is a droid compartment for R2-D2 just behind the cockpit. The 4 wings can all hinge outwards for atmospheric flight mode. The ship is armed with two primary laser cannons and also 2 spring mounted missile launchers underneath.<br />
If I was to point out a single negative aspect of the kit is that there are no controls in the cockpit. Just in front of Yoda, there is a gap which would perfectly fir a 2x1 control panel tile and yet none is included which is disappointing. Even a plain tile and another sticker would&#39;ve done.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>One of the best fighters made and nicely rounds off my collection of Republic fighter craft. It&#39;s also nice to see sets from series 6 of The Clone Wars make it into Lego form as the final year of the show was banished to Netflix. A good looking kit and probably the cheapest way to get the best Yoda minifigure to date.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-06-02T04:31:52.71Z","Fun little set with great proportions ","<p>My son just got this set as a gift, and it is definitely a fun little set designed for kids. While the set could easily have been built by my 5 year old, he decided that I should help him build about half of it.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>My son was pretty excited about getting Yoda, our only other Yoda is a Santa version, although he was a little confused as to why legs don&rsquo;t bend. Yoda&rsquo;s head is a little disappointing in my opinion, our older minifigure&nbsp;actually is a double mold for Yoda&rsquo;s hair, while this one only has the hair printed on the back. Not a problem for a kid, but to an adult it is definitely a downgrade. R2-D2 is my son&rsquo;s second (I have 3 more) so he thought it was funny to get another.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The</strong> <strong>Build&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>the first 2 bags focus primarily on the center of the ship. For such a small fighter, it seems a little overly complex. While it is an enjoyable build, the model would have benefited from a simpler build that left you with more interior space. There was only one step that caused my 5 year old trouble, and that is where you initially push the red technic axels partially in before sliding in another technic brick. This was really just a problem of jumping to conclusions as it seemed logical that the axel should be pushed all the way in, but after showing him how to do it once, he did the second one correctly without help.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The third bag is for the upper and lower wings and is very repetitive, you are basically completing the same build 4 times. It is very simple, but for a 5 year old is a little challenging as you need to make sure the angled plates are cut in the correct direction.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>The</strong> <strong>Model </strong></p>

<p>This ship looks very similar to a TIE fighter, in fact the windshield on it is a TIE&rsquo;s windshield. Looking at this ship with the angled wings, Vader&rsquo;s TIE fighter comes immediately to mind. The interior is very cramped, which seems appropriate for this kind of ship, but makes it a little difficult for a kid to fit in Yoda. Of course the ship can only hold a minifigure with short legs, and since those aren&rsquo;t too common in Star Wars, it really only can hold Yoda. R2 of course sits on the outside which is correct, but to a 5 year old that seems a little strange. There is also the issue that the ship can&rsquo;t carry the light saber, but not a problem for a kid&rsquo;s set, the light saber has already been confiscated by a storm trooper! The missile launchers of course add a lot of play value, my son much prefers these over stud shooters as it is much more difficult to lose a missile than it is a stud.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course what sets this ship apart is its colors. For the most part Star Wars vehicles are pretty drab, so the dark green that dominates this ship certainly allows it to pop out in your collection. I would say that for this reason alone the set is worth having.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, the set seems incredibly well proportioned to minifigure&nbsp;scale, and while it&rsquo;s proportions don&rsquo;t match those of our larger sets (Millennium Falcon and an AT-AT) it is significantly smaller so fits in quite well with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Definitely a set that your kids will enjoy, and while it was a gift, it seems quite reasonably priced. For an AFOL it&rsquo;s not bad, good to have for adding color to your collection, but you might want to save your money for something a bit larger like an X-Wing or a TIE fighter.&nbsp;</p>
