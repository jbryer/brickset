"The_lego_Jedi_ninja","2016-12-17T20:35:34.483Z","Thrawn is back!!","<p>So I&#39;m a huge rebels fan so this set was a must get. But the retail price here in Belgium is &euro;44 and I find that a bit to much for this set but the amazing minifigures make up for that. The new&nbsp;Thrawn and Kanan minifigures are absolutely&nbsp;stunning. Although I wish Thrawn second face would have been a grin instead of agressive&nbsp;expression but that&#39;s nit-picking. The Phantom 2 is an awesome build but everything&#39;s a sticker which is sometimes frustrating.&nbsp;I don&#39;t know if it fits in the Ghost because I don&#39;t have that set but it looks like it&#39;s possible. The back part opens up and you can put a stolen imperial crate there. But if you want you can put a minifigure&nbsp;laying and with it&#39;s legs up in there. Overall I think this is an awesome set. Yes, it&#39;s not perfect but most of my complaints are nit-picks. I would say this is a must get for Star Wars fans just for the awesome Thrawn&nbsp;and Kanan&nbsp;minifigures!&nbsp;</p>

"TK_1308","2017-01-05T17:02:24.233Z","""On the plus side, it looks like we've found a new Phantom.""","<p>Lego continues releases from the third series of Star Wars Rebels with the new Phantom that they stole in The Last Battle.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>Standard mid size rectangular box houses the kit. Admiral Thrawn (should be Grand Admiral) is the figure of choice on the top with Chopper and Kanan Jarrus displayed in the panel next to him.<br />
The front of the box shows the Phantom evading an Imperial attack in deep space. The back shows the ship landed in an Imperial docking bay and the characters battling it out. There are 3 panels showing the play features of the craft.<br />
There is one small rectangular instruction book.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The price per piece ratio is rather high for a kit this size. Most of the pieces are white and grey with some pale blue, red and yellow parts for detailing. Nice to have the new canopy piece to add to my collection.<br />
There are 3 bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains parts for the main hull hull framework and Kanan Jarrus.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 2 contains parts for the upper main hull, hull plating and Chopper.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 3 contains the parts for the dorsal wing, cockpit section and Grand Admiral Thrawn.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The set comes with three minifigures, two of which are currently exclusive to The Phantom.<br />
Firstly, we have C1-10P, a.k.a. Chopper. The little astromech is nicely represented in minifigure form with good detailing but nothing new from the previous releases.<br />
Kanan Jarrus has undergone a significant upgrade. His new torso and trousers are nicely detailed and represent the new outfit he wears since the beginning of series 3. His head has serious and smiling faces printed on it. The beard is well done and his white eyes are perfect. The mask and hair all come in a single molded piece but you could use the hair piece from any other Kanan figure if you wanted to see his face completely. He comes armed with his trusty blue lightsaber.<br />
Finally we come to the fan favourite, Grand Admiral Thrawn. His simple white Imperial uniform looks stunning and the silver highlights for his rank insignia, belt buckle and code cylinders really stand out. He has serious and angry faces on his head piece. Unfortunately, his skin is probably two shades darker than it should be and the white highlights in his red eyes detract from their look. He comes armed with a black compact blaster pistol.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Total building time, 20 minutes.<br />
The build is pretty straightforward and for those who purchased the Separatist Shuttle in 2009, you will find a lot of similarities to that build. However, the designer has done several things to make the kit different from that set while still maintaining the same look.&nbsp;<br />
There is some nice internal S.N.O.T. building techniques inside the upper hull to house the missile launchers. The mechanism for the landing legs is also nicely done.<br />
The overall look of the craft is quite close to the on-screen counterpart, even if the scale is drastically reduced. However, full credit must go to the designer&#39;s thoughts on how this would dock with the current model of The Ghost and this ship does connect very well into the bay allowing you to display the ship with either Phantom.<br />
There are 14 stickers in total. The cockpit section has four, one atop the cockpit, one on each side for yellow detailing and one underneath. There are two on the dorsal fin and 6 on the dorsal hull for colour and detailing. Finally there&#39;s one on the aft hatch and one on top of the weapon&#39;s crate.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The Phantom is a neat little ship but the design is not without its flaws. While a good match for the ship there are several things which probably should&#39;ve been addressed before production. The cockpit canopy doesn&#39;t open, you have to remove it for access. While the cockpit seats one figure, the seat is so low they cannot reach the control panel to fly it.<br />
The double jointed landing legs can fold up for flight mode but when deployed for landing, they&#39;re not particularly stable.<br />
The aft compartment is very small and fits the weapon crate but cannot hold a figure which is a shame.&nbsp;<br />
The firing mechanism for the missile launchers is just above the aft hatch. By sliding the yellow tab to each side, it fires the missiles. However, this is quite difficult to do when the hatch is closed unless you have small fingers.<br />
Despite all these flaws the ship still looks nice as a display piece.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>A lot of fans will be buying this kit simply for Thrawn. For me, it was Thrawn and the new Kanan figure which were the primary draw of the kit but even then it was a stretch to justify it. As stated, there&#39;s a lot of flaws in the set and unless you&#39;re a Rebels or Expanded Universe fan then I&#39;m not sure how universal the appeal of The Phantom will be at the current price point.&nbsp;</p>

"BrianG2402","2017-02-20T15:48:55.597Z","Grand Admiral Thrawn!","<p>Packaging:</p>

<p>Comes in a standard box for a set of this price, with 3 numbered bags, instructions,&nbsp;and a sticker sheet</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs:</p>

<p>Kanan Jarrus: Kanan has a new molded mask/hair combo, which looks amazing, but from really low&nbsp;angles you can see his eyes underneath it, but this is a minor flaw. He has very light eyes, like Chirrut&nbsp;&Icirc;mwe, and more facial hair than his previous minifig. He has a happy face and a serious face, and he comes with a blue lightsaber.</p>

<p>Chopper: A standard Chopper, the same as previous ones, but mine has quite lopsided printing on his head, though I doubt this is universal.</p>

<p>Grand Admiral Thrawn: This minifig is one of the main reasons people are getting this set! His red eyes look splendid and the mavy blue hairpiece is perfect. Unfortunately his rank indicator is incorrect, but again, this is a very minor flaw. His faces are calm,&nbsp;and angry. My only problem is that he really would have benefited from dual molded legs for his&nbsp;boots.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: This build includes a lot of interesting slopes, curves, and angles in white, and there are some interesting orangish yellow tiles as well. There are enough interesting parts here that it would be worth the $30 even if you just want the minifigs, as the interesting parts can be added to your collection for MOCs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Completed Model: The Phantom II is actually better than I was expecting it to be. Sure, it might not be minifigure scale, but what is minifigure scale anyway? Minifigs are proportioned differently from humans. Going by height, I actually would consider this minifigure scale. However, there is only space for one minifigure, unless you take out the weapon crate, make the minifigure sit, and toss them in sideways. Unfortunately, the build does use a lot of stickers, which I don&#39;t mind, but many others will. The landing gear can be a little flimsy, and the cockpit must be removed. Overall the build feels very sturdy, and looks good, despite it&#39;s flaws, and it is bigger than it looks on the box. And it is quite accurate, but I wish the dorsal fin was a little taller.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall: I believe that this set is worth the $30, though in other&nbsp;countries the prices are a little steeper. But this is also a great set for kids, as it has a lot of playability features in the weapons crate, the landing gear, and the spring loaded shooters. I would recommend this set to any Star Wars fan who lives where it is fairly&nbsp;reasonably priced.</p>

"FowlerBricks","2017-12-14T21:58:20.607Z","The Phantom II From A Thrawn Groupie's Point Of View","<p>Before I start this review, I just want to say THRAWN!! ThrawnThrawnThrawnThrawnThrawnThrawnThrawnThrawnThrawnThrawnThrawnThrawn!!! Thrawn!!...</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/hfkgirxoz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>okay, got that out. Let&#39;s move on. Obviously, the reason I got this set was Thrawn (well, and the Thermal Detonators of course). The other two minifigures and even the shuttle itself were just minor bonuses...until I actually bought the set. Thrawn is still the main reason I bought it, but the rest is no longer just a bonus. $30.00 is a bit steep for this set, but I managed to snag it at $17.00. That is a more than fair price, given the inclusion of Thrawn. (Sorry about the crappy pictures. My Lego photography area isn&#39;t that great)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
THE BOX AND INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<p><br />
The box is a funny shape, being longer than is tall and it features the Rogue One box design. I actually really like the box art for this set. it shows the Phantom flying through an asteroid field pursued by TIE fighters. One of the TIEs is in the middle of blowing into a fiery cloud behind the Phantom. The back of the box details the ship&#39;s functions and shows Kanan fighting Thrawn, which is a bit odd since Thrawn tends toward tactical stuff and not hand-to-hand (or Lightsaber-to-Blaster) combat, but it works. The instructions sport the same design as the box.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/hsbup4nqb/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>There was one thing in the instructions that I found interesting: in the back, there&#39;s a minifigure checklist type thing, In the checklist Kanan&#39;s torso colors are all mixed up. Instead of dark tan arms and a green torso, it&#39;s reversed to green arms and a dark tan torso. A small mess up that most people wouldn&#39;t catch, but still, Lego should pay closer attention.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/woadwqekj/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p><br />
THE PARTS<br />
A nice mix of parts, inlcuding a CMF platform, a thermal detonator plus an extra, a light bley crate plus a smattering of sand blue, mint blue and dark yellowish orange.</p>

<p><br />
THE MINIFIGURES</p>

<p><br />
Let&#39;s start with the least interesting first: C1-10P aka Chopper.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/k9nlwcpmb/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Well, maybe I shouldn&#39;t say least interesting because I didn&#39;t have Chopper yet, so he&#39;s pretty interesting to me. But, he does come in a few other sets, so you may or may not already have him. Chopper is unique from other Lego Astromech droids because of his rather squat body and distinctive color scheme.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/7i9fptsoz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>His printing is well done, though the print around his head tends to be slightly off. My only complaint is this: why is there a white ring on the top of his head? He never had that in the show, as far as I could tell. The white on his head is in the very center on his sensor dish, not around the edges. Other than that, he&#39;s mostly perfect. Of course, if you want the center wheel, just swap the back wheel off your Nexo Knights Battle Blaster (if you have one) and voila! Perfection!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/t4og6v6oz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Now what I want to know is where is Dark Chopper? He acted as an Imperial Droid multiple times in Season 1 using a black and red color scheme, yet we still haven&#39;t gotten one. Uncool Lego, Uncool. We need a set that includes Zeb, Dark Chopper, the Imperial Conehead Droid from Episode 14 and Sabine&#39;s custom painted TIE. HEAR THAT LEGO!?!? Anyway, next we have blind Kanan Jarrus, who is exclusive to this set at the time of this review&#39;s writing. All of his parts are exclusive. No re-used stuff here! His hair/mask piece is not rubbery, which is a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/j7dfdteir/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>His face print is excellent, showing his now thicker beard and white blind eyes, very similar to Chirrut Imwe (Blind Force user party!!). One side of his face is grinning , the other is frowning and/or unimpressed. His torso print is simple, but well done. His dark green arm-armor is absent.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/vm07e5lgj/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>His ever-present belt is here, though, stretching remarkably well down from the torso and through the hips and legs to form his blaster holster. The rest of the print on the legs is some brown knee plates. Finally we have THRAWN!! Simple yet perfect. But maybe I&#39;m just severely biased.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/dvyisyn9f/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>After I read the first of Zahn&#39;s books a couple years ago, I dreamed of Lego making a Thrawn figure and I even considered making a Lego Ideas project just so that they&#39;d make one, but I thought, nah, he&#39;s too obscure for anyone to care. But then Disney did something right (or sort of right) for a change and brought him into Rebels and here he is! And in a smaller set nonetheless! So, here we go, let&#39;s take a look. Skin color: check! Thrawn&#39;s trademark blue skin and red eyes are captured perfectly here, as is his I&#39;m-A-Master-Strategist-And-I-Fear-Nothing face. It looks almost like he&#39;s bored with the fight the rebels are putting up. Yup, the rebels best is no match for Thrawn. His opposite face shows a rare flash of anger.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/hsbup3l5f/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>A smirk might have served better...wait, no! I didn&#39;t just criticize him! Umm...someone else said that a smirk may have served better and out of the goodness of my heart I didn&#39;t contradict him...yeah, that&#39;s what happened. Thrawn&#39;s hair is also perfect, using a recolored close-cropped hairpiece that seems like it&#39;ll stay pretty rare in this color. His torso looks perfect to me as well, though I&#39;ve heard that the rank bar is incorrect. After a quick internet search, I can see the differences, but it&#39;s easily overlooked. His legs are plain white, which works fine, though the dual colored ones from the Ninjago Movie CMF line looks even better, as shown in Brickset&#39;s official review of the set. Thrawn comes armed with a blaster pistol.</p>

<p><br />
THE BUILD</p>

<p><br />
This set goes together quickly, but there&#39;s not a dull moment during the build...well, maybe the landing gear might be slightly dull but that&#39;s it. There were even a few surprises for me as well. I won&#39;t spoil the building process for you though.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
THE COMPLETED MODEL</p>

<p><br />
First, the crate. It has one sticker and contains the thermal detonator plus you can put the extra in.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/kmf02epur/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Two puny thermal detonators in a giant crate is kind of lame though, since you could probably fit fifteen or so detonators in there.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/bre5rw8s3/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>I suggest adding a couple of stud shooters and ammo as well to make it actually worth stealing.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/cgwy49h1f/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Now, the shuttle has quite a few stickers on it, even one on the underside. I&#39;m not one to complain about stickers though, and I actually enjoy them most of the time.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ctocakws3/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>And no, you can&#39;t leave them off. They are necessary. While the Phantom II does have some laser cannons in the show, Lego has omitted them on this model, probably due to the size. Fortunately Lego didn&#39;t leave the ship defenseless. On either side of the cockpit is a spring-loaded shooter.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ium17l6ir/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>They&#39;re very cleverly incorporated into the design of the ship and positioned in such a way that the laser blasts come from the general area where the cannons would be. The trigger for launching the missiles is located directly above the boarding ramp in the back.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/4o6acdisz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Sometimes Lego makes play features glaringly obvious but they&#39;ve struck a good balance. The trigger for the spring-shooters is yellow but it blends nicely with the color scheme. The upper fin is considerably shorter than that of a normal Sheathipede-class shuttles, but I&#39;ve heard that the Ghost&#39;s crew sawed it off a bit but I don&#39;t know for sure because I haven&#39;t reached the part where the Phantom II shows up yet.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/k9nlwas6b/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>It looks great in my opinion though. Chopper fits into a droid socket that&#39;s offset behind the cockpit. If you modify Chopper the way I mentioned earlier, you need to remove the 2x2 round plate in the socket and you&#39;ll be good to go!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/bre5s03o3/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The windshield on the cockpit does not hinge open unfortunately. It&#39;s attached by only a few studs so you can just pull it off. I don&#39;t &nbsp;blame Lego for doing this, though, as it would have been very difficult to make it hinge without bringing the parts count much higher and keeping the design consistent. Moving to the interior of the cockpit, there&#39;s a nice brown no-studs seat for Kanan plus an excellent printed console piece as well as some orange lights.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ey8pbkiyb/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/nt9jm255v/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The whole cockpit can act as an escape pod, detaching from the rear of the ship and making it&#39;s way to safety, leaving poor Chopper behind.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/75i1jp7v7/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The landing gear is as close to perfect as you can get at this scale, allowing you to tuck it up and away when the ship is in flight. I feel like I didn&#39;t focus on the fin enough, so let&#39;s backtrack a bit and take another look. Both sides of the fin is built from plates and when you attach them it looks deceptively simple. Full points to Lego!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/srx20n6er/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The cargo bay in the back can fit the crate and Kanan&#39;s lightsaber (all in one piece) quite nicely. If you remove the crate you can fit a passenger, but it&#39;s very awkward.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/cgwy4c9cj/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/xqkkf6xcz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>My only complaint is the lack of engines. Maybe the tan spots on the back are supposed to represent the engines, but I think Lego could have done better. Even a couple of stickers would have worked, in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
OVERALL</p>

<p><br />
I&#39;m very happy with this set. It has great minifigures and the ship itself is very sturdy and swooshable, despite the fact that it seems to lack engines. I&#39;ll find myself swooping it around the room. It just begs to be swooshed.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/dvyiszpub/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/dvyit4nb7/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The color scheme is very eye catching. And to top all that off, I got it at a great price. There are only a few things that could have made it better: Engines, a Storm Trooper and maybe making the Phantom itself slightly wider to be more accurate and give more value for the money.&nbsp;</p>

"Torrent_Studios","2023-01-26T08:26:12.823Z","The Phantom II: Is Thrawn worth it?","<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
<br />
<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75170-1/The-Phantom"">75170 <em>The Phantom</em></a><em> </em>was my first <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Star-Wars/subtheme-Rebel""><em>LEGO Star Wars&nbsp;Rebels</em></a>&nbsp;set, which I bought in January of 2022 after scraping together the inflated price that this set goes for nowadays.</p>

<p>I had just finished binging <em>Rebels </em>on<em> Disney+</em>, and it was a show that I absolutely loved.<br />
<br />
This set was released in 2017, about 5 years ago,&nbsp;so it is fairly recent. However, the average price nowadays for this set does not at all reflect that. A new and sealed copy of this set will set you back at least 200.</p>

<p>All for one minifigure.<br />
<br />
<strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>The box is quite large. The dark borders of the 2017 <em>Rogue One</em> box art is very appealing, with an Imperial Death Trooper as the box mascot, flanked by some T.I.E. fighters.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
On the back is an action shot of Kanan leaping at Thrawn from the <em>Phantom</em>&#39;s removable cockpit, in an Imperial-esque docking bay.<br />
<br />
The box I received had thumb tabs, unfortunately, which is bound to complicate unboxing.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contents and build process</strong><br />
<br />
The box contains 3 numbered bags, with the three minifigures evenly divided. There is also a medium-sized sticker sheet, but most of the stickers are thankfully easy to apply. Unfortunately, my copy had some stickers peeling off, which might have been caused by age. They still look perfectly good after assembly though.<br />
<br />
It took me about an hour to assemble the set at a leisurely pace.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
<br />
First and foremost, the reason that you&#39;ll be buying this set nowadays:</p>

<p><strong>Grand Admiral Thrawn</strong>.<br />
<br />
Mistakenly labelled as &quot;<em>Admiral Thrawn</em>&quot; on the box, this white whale of a&nbsp;figure is highly sought after by many LEGO Star Wars fans, myself included. I am very pleased to have such a rare minifigure in my collection, and Thrawn alone certainly commands the high value of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75170-1/The-Phantom"">75170 The Phantom</a>.</p>

<p>The minifigure itself looks great, although&nbsp;room for improvement remains. For one, his Imperial rank plaque displays the wrong rank. This is a relatively minor issue in my opinion, but for other hardcore fans, I can understand the frustration. The designers most likely had only concept art with which to design this set, and Thrawn must&#39;ve looked how he does in this set, causing the inaccuracy.</p>

<p>I like his crisp white Imperial uniform, which otherwise looks very accurate though. His legs are plain white, which is disappointing as he is clearly shown onscreen with black boots.&nbsp;The figure most certainly would benefit from dual-molded legs. Fortunately, this is easily fixed with the legs from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71019-19/Sushi-Chef"">Sushi Chef</a>, which I happen to own.<br />
<br />
His head has two facial expressions, one frowning, and one grimacing. His dark blue hairpiece is a rare dark blue recolour of a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-92081"">common piece</a>, and compliments his skin colour quite well. Unfortunately, <em>Dark Azur</em>&nbsp;seems a few shades too dark for Thrawn&#39;s skin colour, which seems closer to LEGO&#39;s <em><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/colour-Medium-Blue"">Medium Blue</a></em>&nbsp;in both <em>Legends </em>and<em> Canon</em>. Thrawn comes equipped with a black blaster pistol, barely resembling the weapon he wields in <em>Rebels</em>.<br />
<br />
With the character&#39;s rumoured return&nbsp;in the upcoming<em> <a href=""https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Star_Wars:_Ahsoka"">Ahsoka</a></em> TV series, LEGO might produce a new and more affordable&nbsp;version of Thrawn, possibly driving down the severely inflated price of this set.<br />
<br />
<strong>Kanan Jarrus</strong> is also a great addition to this set. Unfortunately, he is essentially the only <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/tag-Spectres"">Spectre</a>&nbsp;from <em>Rebels Season Three</em> to receive an update in LEGO. Hopefully, LEGO will one day get around to producing the rest of the Ghost crew&#39;s updated outfits.<br />
<br />
Following his blinding by Maul at the Sith temple on Malachor, Kanan now wears a green mask to shield his milky white eyes. This is perfectly captured with the then-new hairpiece, with the mask portion painted onto Kanan&#39;s altered original hairpiece. I love the jaig eye detailing, which is perfectly accurate.<br />
<br />
Kanan&#39;s new face print depicts his beard grown out, due to his inability to shave while blind. Kanan&#39;s unseeing eyes are captured well, and his two expressions depict him mildly frowning, and smiling on the reverse. These two expressions actually mirror Kanan&#39;s original figure, which I found quite pleasing.<br />
<br />
His torso and legs are both new, with the torso having fairly simple but accurate printing on both sides, and brown straps and kneepads adorning the legs which are&nbsp;a&nbsp;recolour from Kanan&#39;s original figure, with some added detail. Kanan comes equipped with his blue lightsaber.</p>

<p><strong>Chopper</strong> is quite a feisty member of the Spectres, and he rounds off the great minifigure selection of this set. He is quite common within the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Star-Wars/subtheme-Rebel""><em>LEGO Star Wars Rebels</em> subtheme</a>, and has received no updates since his release.<br />
<br />
His design is quite good though, and still holds up well. The printing on his dark orange dome is unfortunately skewed, which I suspect is a problem plaguing every copy of this minifigure. His light bluish gray short droid&nbsp;legs look great, and are sufficiently&nbsp;versatile. I enjoy the accurate printing on both sides of his torso as well.<br />
<br />
<strong>Model</strong><br />
<br />
The <strong><em>Phantom II</em></strong> from <em>Star Wars Rebels&#39; Season 3</em> is represented here. Originally a Separatist <em>Sheathipede</em>-class transport shuttle, it was salvaged by Kanan, Chopper, Ezra and Rex from an abandoned base on Agamar, from the tactical droid Kalani.<br />
<br />
The bodywork of the original craft comprises lots of complex curves, something which I think LEGO has failed to recreate accurately. However, I am quite pleased with what they have managed to achieve.</p>

<p>This set is definitely visually similar to other <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8036-1/Separatist-Shuttle"">LEGO Separatist shuttles</a>. The two large curved plates that form the top of the passenger compartment are decorated with two stickers on each side, forming some blue detail with yellow highlights. These correspond with the armour panels that Sabine Wren installed onto the shuttle after painting it over. These look great, but unfortunately fail to recreate the <em>Phantom II</em>&#39;s elegant curves on its back.&nbsp;These mask&nbsp;one of the best play features of this set: the spring-loaded shooters on the sides.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
These shooters roughly correspond with the locations of the laser cannons on the original craft, and the play feature has been integrated very neatly, with some unusual building techniques. The missiles can be fired by swinging a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6010863/triangel"">yellow Technic &quot;triangel&quot; piece</a>, and this feature can be activated even&nbsp;with the docking ramp shut. Unfortunately, this does leave a slightly unsightly gap between the roof of the compartment and the edge of the ramp, but I think this is a reasonable compromise for a playset like this.<br />
<br />
The passenger compartment is very small, not even able to hold a minifigure sitting down. This is one of the biggest issues for me in the set, and one of the compromises which I have a hard time accepting. I plan to remove the shooters and enlarge the compartment. To fill in this awkward space, a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6108560/box-3x4"">4x3 grey crate</a> is included, covered by a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6076678/plate-3x4-with-4-knobs"">4x3 tile</a> which has a small stickered Imperial insignia. Inside this crate is one round&nbsp;thermal detonator tile, with another one as a spare. There is still a lot of space in the crate, and you could fit Thrawn&#39;s blaster or Kanan&#39;s lightsaber pieces inside if you wish. I think that another detonator or two could have been included to fill more of the space though.<br />
<br />
The dorsal fin is very securely connected to the hull, with a Technic beam that runs vertically through the centre of the ship. The sides of the fin, built with S.N.O.T., are decorated with two stickers which depict accurate&nbsp;Phoenix logos. I like the red sloped brick on the back of the fin, although the red&nbsp;looks slightly incongruous.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As a play feature, the cockpit section&nbsp;is detachable as an escape pod. This is of course not an actual feature of the original craft in the show, but represents another compromise made for a playset. There is ample space inside for Kanan and other minifigures to sit, and it can even accommodate Hera and her lekku. In front of the seat is a printed control panel, which was quite new for its time.<br />
<br />
Between the cockpit and the passenger compartment is a droid socket for Chopper. The droid fits neatly into the space, which is accurately offset towards the left of the ship.<br />
<br />
Landing gear is provided in the form of four spindly legs, which can be folded upwards and largely concealed, although they do not fold inwards like they can in the show. These legs are securely hinged, and they look good to me. However, the pair of the legs at the front are actually mounted one plate higher than those at the rear, resulting in the Phantom tipping forwards at a downward angle. This is easily fixed though, by having the rear hinges at a wider angle.<br />
<br />
Most surfaces are tiled off and I love the sleek look of the shuttle.<br />
<br />
Almost all the details are represented by stickers, which might be an issue for some, although I appreciate them.<br />

<strong>Can 75170 <em>The Phantom</em> <em>DOCK</em> with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75053-1/The-Ghost"">75053 <em>The Ghost</em></a>?</strong><br />
<br />
<em>Yes!</em><br />
<br />
I&#39;ve heard a lot of people ask this particular question, so I went over to a friend&#39;s house and borrowed his copy of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75053-1/The-Ghost"">75083 <em>The Ghost</em></a> to experiment, since I don&#39;t have one and can&#39;t afford one nowadays.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m happy to say that the designer of this set has created this set with the original Ghost in mind, and it is impressive that both sets are compatible. Unfortunately, I suspect that the compatibility must&#39;ve affected the design in some ways, although I am pleased with the current design. The <em>Phantom II</em> does look a little oversized on the Ghost though.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Being one of the white whales of my collection, I absolutely love this set, despite its numerous inaccuracies and flaws.</p>

<p>Admiral Thrawn and Kanan Jarrus&#39; minifigures will fetch a good price nowadays, and they are very well-designed minifigures.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The shuttle itself is quite a solid model, and serves its purpose very well as a playset.<br />
<br />
75170 <em>The Phantom</em> is also the last <em>Rebels</em> set released, and I hope that other <em>Rebels</em> characters will appear in LEGO sets in the near future.<br />
<br />
If you&#39;re a fan of <em>Rebels</em> and are ready to pay the price, you&#39;ll want to collect this set.<br />
<em>Rebels</em> is a very underrated show and I hope more people might one day come around to enjoying it, as I did.<br />
