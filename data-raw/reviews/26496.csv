<h3>Box &amp; Instructions</h3>

<p>There&#39;s not a whole lot to say about the box; it&#39;s got the Rogue One branding, showing the Y-wing in battle on the front and a hangar scene on the back.</p>

<p>Instructions are in a single book with some images of other Rogue One sets at the back.</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>There are 5 minifigs in this set and they&#39;re a strange mix.</p>

<p><strong>Y-Wing Pilot</strong><sup><strong>TM&nbsp;</strong> </sup></p>

<p>The first is an unnamed pilot in a dark blue flight suit. He looks great but I can&#39;t find any source images of rebel pilots in dark blue suits so I don&#39;t know how accurate he is. The helmet vizor is printed on his head rather than being a physical vizor and this face has been used in a few sets since 2014.</p>

<p><strong>Admiral Raddus</strong><sup><strong>TM&nbsp;</strong> </sup></p>

<p>This cousin of Admiral Ackbar is also dressed in dark blue and the print on his torso looks spot on.</p>

<p><strong>Moroff</strong><sup><strong>TM&nbsp;</strong> </sup></p>

<p>This Yeti-like creature is a mercenary, carrying an impressive backpack. Like wookie minifigs his head and chest are one big piece and it&#39;s unique to this minifigure who sofar is unique to this set.</p>

<p><strong>Rebel Astromech Droid</strong><sup> </sup></p>

<p>Just like the pilot, his droid is nameless. He is shaped like R2-D2 but is dark grey, with a transparent brown dome.</p>

<p><strong>Stormtrooper</strong><sup><strong>TM&nbsp;</strong> </sup></p>

<p>The last minifig is a generic stormtrooper.</p>

<p>The last Y-wing set had a princess Leia minifig besides the pilot and droid, this time we get an admiral, a mercenary and a stormtrooper and I just wonder why? The set also comes with a crane for loading bombs but strangely there&#39;s no ground crew. On the back of the box you see the pilot driving the crane while Moroff and Raddus are in a gunfight with the stormtrooper.</p>

<p>Admiral Raddus and Moroff have little to do with the Y-wing but they make some sort of sense if you&#39;re setting up a scene at the rebel base. The stormtrooper in this set makes no sense at all and I&#39;d rather have seen a ground crew member to operate the crane.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is less white and more grey in this set than in 9495. There are a lot of greeble-bits like clips and bars, a number of 4x4 round bricks and half-cylinders for the engines, some Technic for the engine struts and the bomb mechanism.</p>

<p>The cockpit piece has the familiar shape but a new print; the roof is now a solid sand blue. To match this there are also hinge plates and a 2x4 Technic plate in sand blue. The most unexpected pieces for me were 8 ice skates...</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are some stickers as well. Danger stripes on the crane, the dashboard and 4 large ones to wrap around the half-cylinders for the engines.</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>I really enjoyed building this set. The construction of the cockpit is quite different from previous incarnations and uses some interesting parts. Behind the cockpit is the section for the droid who still sits sideways because there&#39;s just no room otherwise.</p>

<p>The main body also has a clever construction, this time for the bomb mechanism. It&#39;s a nice play feature that&#39;s almost invisible. The way the engines are connected has also been changed a bit and is more subtle.</p>

<p>The engines themselves have had quite an upgrade although they still rely on large stickers. This time though there are 4 stickers, not 2, so they go around the entire engine, not just the outside. The jet part is built with 3x3 cones surrounded by ice-skates and looks great. The rings at the back of the engines are finally open rings, not discs with a black circle in the middle like last time.</p>

<h3>The model</h3>

<p>The ship just looks great. While at first it may appear very similar to the previous Y-wing, on closer inspection almost every detail is different. The greebling works well and the sand blue is a nice touch in the colour scheme. The engines especially look great although I would love to see the texture of the main part of the engine done in brick rather than stickers.</p>

<h3>Play features</h3>

<p>As a play set this is great. The ship is sturdy enough to be swooshable, it has missiles underneath and a bomb mechanism that works very well. The set comes with a crane for acting out stories at the rebel base. There are five minifigures and although they&#39;re a slightly odd selection they allow many different scenes.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This is a brilliant set. The only issues I have are large stickers on the engines and the selection of minifigures and they won&#39;t bother the target audience. The design is interesting, it looks great and it&#39;s got a lot of play features. And at &euro;69.99 for 691 parts it&#39;s very good value for a Star Wars set.</p>

"Kris_PL","2017-01-21T19:41:37.86Z","Fresh look at an all-time classic","<p>January brought a new wave of Star Wars sets and the 75172 Y-wing Starfighter was the first on list. With new exclusive minifigures and a side build, this set looked like a great deal, so I ordered it and I have to say I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed.</p>

<h2>Box and instruction</h2>

<p>The long box looks ok. The Deathtrooper image on the top indicates the Rogue One brand and the back of the box shows Y wing in a hangar with all of its features. Instruction consists of one booklet and a sticker sheet. There are 5 numbered bags inside the box.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>We get 4 minifigures in this set plus the astromech. The robot is nameless and it features a transparent dome with orange printing and a nice grey body. The Rebel pilot is also nameless and is my least liked figure of this set. While it&rsquo;s indeed a nice figure, we already got one in 75155 Rebel U-wing fighter set, which was released just couple of months ago. I wished for someone from original trilogy, however it would probably raise the price tag. Admiral Raddus makes his first appearance in minifigure scale and he looks splendid. He also shares the same dark blue color of his attire like the pilot. Moroff, while getting little screen time in the movie, gets an amazing minifigure with a nice big backpack. The mold of this figure is very accurate to the universe and so far he is exclusive to this set.</p>

<p>Generic Stormtrooper is the bad guy in this set and he doesn&rsquo;t stand a chance, since all he has is&hellip;. a blaster. There is nothing else on the bad guy side, so why bother adding him to a rebel dominated set? It makes little sense, since we have a little crane with some weapons, but no ground crew to operate it.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>It was a really fun set to build. I especially loved how cockpit came together and how it connected to the main body of the craft. The engines, while repeatable, were an ok build too. All together the process took me an hour to complete.</p>

<h2>The Completed Model</h2>

<p>It is my first Y-wing so I can&rsquo;t really compare it to the other ones.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>It&rsquo;s a faithful representation of the craft.</li>
	<li>Packs a ton of play features. I love the hidden missile drop compartment. It&rsquo;s hidden, smart and easy to reload.</li>
	<li>Very stable.</li>
	<li>The landing gear is nicely integrated and barely visible.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-left:2.25pt"">Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Spring loaded shooters. They are way too visible. I wish they were more integrated. They stand out from under the cockpit area and for me it&rsquo;s just disturbing. Had mine removed.</li>
	<li>I wish there was more in there was something more for the pilot. There is just one single console and that&rsquo;s it.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style=""margin-left: 2.25pt;"">Final Thoughts</h2>

<p style=""margin-left:2.25pt"">The Y-wing is an iconic spacecraft and LEGO did a very good job presenting it in minifigure scale. It&#39;s very swoshable and it looks great next to a x-wing. The minifigure selection is a bit odd, but maybe im just too picky. The small crane and weapons transport is a nice side build, which adds more play value to the set. Generally the play features are really fun. In conclusion, i recommend getting this set. While it has some flaws, i don&#39;t think there is huge room for improvement.&nbsp;</p>

"thoughtsonblocks","2017-03-13T13:30:55.453Z","Top notch Lego design","<p>This is hands down one of the highest quality, best built Star Wars space ships I have seen from Lego. &nbsp;It has an interesting mini fig selection with four minifigs and a droid. &nbsp;It also includes some ground equipment that looks decent and adds some great playability, holding two spring loaded shooter rounds and also two of the missiles/bombs that are launched from the drum feed bomb bay. &nbsp;The model itself is a decent size, well proportioned, with a classic yellow (or gold) gray and white paint scheme. &nbsp;The cockpit has room for one plus space for the astromech behind the cockpit. &nbsp;The functional bomb bay with its rotating&nbsp;drum and reload slot are a great play feature that is done in a way that does not detract from the visual quality of the model. &nbsp;The care and attention the designed put into this Y-wing is some of the best I have seen, the detailing and greebling, angles and colors are all top notch, and I appreciate the well executed attempt to cover up the holes in the technic beams that create the skeleton of the model. &nbsp;This is an area that frequently ruins many otherwise great models, and it is not a problem on the Y-Wing at all. &nbsp;I appreciated the design steps taken to get the shape of the cockpit area right and the ion cannon turret looks good. &nbsp;To top it all off, the set comes in at only $59.99 which is about $20 less than similar piece count Star Wars sets on the market right now, especially considering the quality and 4 minifigs. &nbsp;This has to be one of my most satisfying and best value sets yet.</p>

"tjarrett","2017-05-25T16:11:27Z","So much changes, so much remains the same","<p>When I heard that 2017 would bring a new Y-Wing, I was excited. I always loved the Y-Wing and&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7152-1/TIE-Fighter-Y-wing"">7152 TIE Fighter and Y-Wing</a>&nbsp;was the set that brought me out of my Dark Ages, about fifteen years ago. But today the Y-Wing looks a little long in the tooth by comparison with more modern sets, so I was looking forward to seeing how the new set compared. Short answer: almost everything has changed, but the new set still looks like a Y-Wing, just much nicer.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing special here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>As a Lego fan since Classic Space years, the proliferation of different types of angled plates (what I would have, in the days of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6861-1/X1-Patrol-Craft"">6861</a>, called &quot;wings&quot;) and curved plates (&quot;slopes&quot;) is exciting. The use of different types of parts to achieve higher levels of detail and &quot;greebling&quot; is particularly fun -- who knew minifigure skates were so versatile?</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It&#39;s always nice to get a new Mon Calamari, especially the heroic Admiral Raddus. The others&mdash;a Stormtrooper, Moroff, a Rebel&nbsp;pilot, R3-S1&mdash;are less groundbreaking but well executed.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>One of the fun things about how Lego has evolved since 7152 is the evolution of the build. Things like the attachment of the engine nacelles and the cockpit to the main structure area are much sturdier in 75172 than the old version. And the bomb dropping play feature is brilliantly built and a lot of fun to play with.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>For all the changes since 7152, the end product is remarkably similar at first glance, but a closer look reveals some significant differences for the better. The new model is about five or six studs longer than the old one (see pictures below), with all the difference in the cockpit (which feels more in proportion to the model now) or the body. The nacelles are almost identical in dimension but look much cooler thanks to the improved greebling (and, it must be said, some stickers). And the play features are just awesome.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A picture is worth a thousand words, so here&#39;s 2000 words worth of summing up, the old model vs. the new. A worthy addition &mdash; or upgrade &mdash; to your Star Wars Lego collection.</p>

"bandit778","2017-01-23T21:10:34.967Z","One for Original Trilogy fans, thanks to a brilliant Rogue One Set.","<p>As an AFOL only out of my dark age for a couple of years, I&#39;ve been eagerly&nbsp;awaiting a new version of the Y-Wing fighter as it&#39;s one of my favorite OT ships and I&#39;d missed out on the previous version by about 3 years so this set was really welcome even if it was from Rogue One.</p>

<p><strong>A note about the Box</strong>.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t normally much to say about&nbsp;a box but I am really impressed with the box art for the Rogue One sets, the Death Trooper and Tie Fighters in the corner really stand out&nbsp;and the large image of the Y-Wing in flight&nbsp;makes the memories of&nbsp;my younger self shout out with delight.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures.</strong></p>

<p>There are 5 minifigures in this set (if you include the droid).</p>

<p>Admiral Raddus, Moroff, a Y-Wing/U-Wing Pilot, a Stormtrooper and R3-S1 and in my opinion there isn&#39;t a bad minifigure amongst them although I&#39;m not entirely sure why the Stormtrooper&nbsp;was included as he seems a bit out of place because this&nbsp;looks like it&#39;s supposed to be set&nbsp;in some sort of rebel base / ship.</p>

<p>The Admiral&#39;s head&nbsp;and&nbsp;Moroff&#39;s head/torso piece are excellent moulds&nbsp;and the torso printing on all&nbsp;the &#39;good guys&#39; is an excellent representation of the uniforms worn (Moroff even has hair printed on his torso despite not being seen with the head piece in place).</p>

<p>Admiral Raddus, Moroff and R3 are exclusive figures to this set, and the Pilot is only available in this set and #75155.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>There are some useful parts in this build. There are a good selection&nbsp;of slopes and wedges in various colours. There are also 2 of the&nbsp;1x1 brick with studs on 2 sides in Tan (26604) &amp; 1 each of&nbsp;the relatively new w<font face=""Arial"">edge plate 2 x 2 left (24299) and right (24307) in white which&nbsp;will make a welcome addition to my parts portfolio. The&nbsp;cockpit canopy, which is nicely&nbsp;printed, is exclusive&nbsp;to this set and there are is also a selection of plates that while not new, do come in Sand Blue for the first time but are exclusive to the Y-Wing at the time of writing.</font></p>

<p><strong>The Build.</strong></p>

<p>The contents of the box are spread out over 5 bags, a reasonably small single instruction book and the obligatory sticker sheet.</p>

<p>Bag 1: The filler.</p>

<p><img alt=""Bag 1"" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/357/31520829153_a6365af7c1_c.jpg"" style=""width: 386px; height: 263px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>Summery</strong>.</p>

<p>While this isn&#39;t one of the biggest or technically advanced builds, it has been one of my favourites. The minifigures are&nbsp;brilliantly moulded and printed and will make excellent additions&nbsp;to the Star Wars roster. The ship itself is wonderful. It&#39;s a well built and sturdy model and I defy any fan of Star Wars who builds this not to take it for a spin round the living room (when nobodies looking obviously).&nbsp;</p>

<p>My only small complaint with this set has to be with the bomb loader crane. From an AFOL&#39;s point of view it holds absolutely no interest and the brick count used could have been used elsewhere&nbsp;within the set but even from a playability point of view, it&#39;s not properly functional as the jib only has up and down travel, which wouldn&#39;t be quite so bad but then the missiles that it&#39;s supposed to pick up are fixed in place with a hinge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apart from that, this is an excellent set and a worthy addition to any collection.</p>

"andyh1984","2017-04-27T16:11:48.9Z","A great build of an iconic ship","<p>I wanted this set as soon as I saw advance images and it hasn&#39;t disappointed</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>You start with little crane truck and trailer and the main body then the cockpit section and the two sections that sit between the body and the engines and finally the two engine nacelles</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Admiral Raddus&nbsp;has a darkish grey version of the Admiral Ackbar headpiece, which is great for those who want different Mon Calamari figs with a blue uniform.</p>

<p>Moroff is an excellent Minifigure despite his blink and you miss him appearance in Rogue One with fur printing on his torso and legs and a unique head/chest piece which uses dual moulding for the grey section.</p>

<p>The Y-wing pilot has a blue flightsuit with life support gear printed on the front.</p>

<p>The astromech droid has a grey body but shinier grey for the legs, it also has a smoked clear translucent dome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Stormtrooper looks pretty standard.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This is an astoundingly good set with good Minifigures although why a Stormtrooper is in a rebel base is anyones guess (maybe the designers had a budget for another Minifigure but not enough for a specific one). I am really glad I got this set.</p>

"ra226","2018-04-04T22:43:20.85Z","An excellent Y-Wing, a worthy upgrade to anything before it","<p>So I was perfectly happy with #7658--I really was. &nbsp;The engines looked fine, the colors were good, the greebling appropriate, and the ship over-all looked very nice--equal parts streamlining and junkyard. &nbsp;A proper Y-Wing. &nbsp;When #9495 Gold Leader&#39;s Y-Wing came around in 2012, I looked at it, and the nose was a bit more accurate, but I decided to pass. &nbsp;Then came this model--it doesn&#39;t look all that different from #9495, but this time I took the plunge, and&nbsp;here&#39;s why:</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Retractable landing gear.&nbsp; Lego has been doing this a lot more recently and I love the trend.&nbsp; The Star Wars sets are big enough that it&#39;s about time it became standard and this is another one of the major reasons I upgraded.</li>
	<li>Actual exhaust ports--I can&#39;t believe how long it&#39;s taken to get this rather than a solid round 4x4 with pretend&nbsp;exhaust (usually via a colored 2x2 dish). &nbsp;This was another major selling point&nbsp;for me.</li>
	<li>Very cool astromech with a partially transparent dome. &nbsp;Minifigs aren&#39;t usually a draw for me, but I really like the look of this R3 unit (apparently transparent domes come standard on&nbsp;the R3 series).</li>
	<li>Great printing on pilot&#39;s body--particularly the hose on his torso matching his hips perfectly.</li>
	<li>Spring-loaded bolt&nbsp;shooters under the nose. &nbsp;These are much more fun than the old flick-fires (which in my experience failed half the time). &nbsp;I removed the bolt shooters from my X-Wing, but these ones are in a much less obtrusive mounting location so I don&#39;t mind them at all.</li>
	<li>Intricate design work on engines--struts look good, and the use of ice skates in the engine is particularly clever.</li>
	<li>The bombs in the rear section were another big selling point for me. &nbsp;I love that they actually look like bombs (not the neon green balls I had on my old 2007 model) and the mechanism to load them and deploy them (almost like an ammo clip) works very well. &nbsp;With a little twiddling, you can get all four of them in there at once.&nbsp; It&#39;s hard to describe the satisfying way one drops into place from the slot in the top as another soon falls out through the bomb bay.</li>
	<li>The nose section was a very interesting build with more clever design work to accomplish the Y-Wing&#39;s unique curves. &nbsp;An elbow joint clip is used to hold things in place and it works very well.</li>
	<li>I don&#39;t usually mention price--I&#39;m used to the cost of Lego these days--but as Star Wars sets go, this is quite a set for what you&#39;re paying.&nbsp; It&#39;s not hard to find this set for under $50 at a local retail store.&nbsp; This would be an excellent set at the typical $0.10/pc.&nbsp; At $0.07 it&#39;s kind of a no-brainer.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Ion gun does not pitch up or down though it still swivels left and right. &nbsp;This is one feature I miss from #7658.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Neutral</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>One of Akbar&#39;s race, another storm trooper (great for you troop builders), and an abominable snowman-looking guy whom I have no knowledge of, are also included.&nbsp; While these extra minifigs and the yellow utility vehicle are nice enough, I&#39;d rather have saved the money and not had them included.&nbsp; Not that there&#39;s much room to complain given the already great price on this set.</li>
	<li>There are stickers.&nbsp; Not many, but a few.&nbsp; Stickers don&#39;t bother me as long as they don&#39;t disintegrate and I haven&#39;t seen the disintegration problem in years, so I&#39;m fine with them.</li>
</ul>

<p>In short, this is the most accurate Y-Wing we&#39;ve ever gotten in minifig scale. &nbsp;So much so that I&#39;m on the fence as to whether I really even want the recently announced UCS Y-Wing (which looks great but honestly is not all <em>that</em> much better than this one). &nbsp;2007&#39;s Y-Wing is still not a bad set, and 2012&#39;s is an improvement over it, but the polish on this one makes it superior to those before it in many ways.&nbsp; As a Star Wars fan, I consider it a pretty decent&nbsp;upgrade to the previous Y-Wing, but a very clear upgrade from anything before that.&nbsp; And for the price, you really can&#39;t go wrong.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2017-12-19T15:22:11.23Z","Rogue One Refreshes Classic ","<p>The Y-Wing was one of the first Star Wars ships to be designed, having appeared in concept art before the X-Wing was conceived! The classic ship made a triumphant return to the franchise in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Rebels&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Rogue One.&nbsp;</em>Rogue One in particular gave the ship some screen time on Eadu and the climactic Battle of Scarrif in the film. Released five years after the previous Y-Wing (9495-1) with a $10 increase in base MSRP, how does this new bird stack up?</p>

<p><strong>Figures</strong></p>

<p>Part of justification for an increased price compared to the previous set, is the addition of five figures this go around instead of three. The Rebel Pilot included is in a Rogue One themed blue jumpsuit which looks impressive, but doesn&#39;t match the orange jumpsuits used by Y-Wing pilots in the film. Sadly, the figure is identical to the pilot from the 2016 U-Wing set; lacking a new helmet print.&nbsp;</p>

<p>R3-S1 is arguably the more impressive member of the Y-Wing&#39;s crew. With a dark transparent dome, R3-S1&nbsp;stands out compared to other astromechs. Just like the R5-F7 figure from the prior Y-Wing, R3-S1 represents another attempt by Lego at capturing the unique variations of astromech droids in the Star Wars saga. Considering the previous R3 figures come in a retired set (Imperial Assault Carrier), a hard to find polybag&nbsp;(R3-M2), and a pricey UCS set (the re-released Death Star); R3-S1 is one of the easier to obtain R3 droids currently in the Lego catalog.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like the Y-Wing pilot, the Stormtrooper is an identical figure to what can be found in other sets. However, this is the perfect army builder figure; and I can&#39;t complain about his inclusion. For kid&#39;s who might not have many other Lego Star Wars sets, this provides an &quot;enemy&quot; for the Rebels to fight... although admittedly one man against a torpedo bomber seems to be a bit of an unfair fight in my opinion! ;)</p>

<p>One of the exclusive figures in the set, and one that will catch a lot of attention is Admiral Raddus. Although his role was small in Rogue One, the gray skinned Mon Cala caught audience&#39;s attention with his brash command style. After his presumed death at the end of Rogue One a ship named in his honor appears in&nbsp;<em>The Last Jedi</em>&nbsp;which has a pretty impressive scene with some cool visuals&nbsp;towards the end of the film&#39;s second act (I won&#39;t spoil anymore of that for those who have yet to see the film). The head is the same mold used on previous Mon Calamari figures, but with updated colors and prints to captures the look of the aquatic leader in the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another eye catching figure is Moroff. The figure is tall and top heavy, with a large backpack and custom blaster which can be stored on his back. Moroff&nbsp;appears in the film as a member of Saw Gurrera&#39;s terroist cell on Jedha; however cut scenes from the film would have had him joining the Rebel attack on Scarrif&nbsp;in the finale along with the other characters included in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Finished Model</strong></p>

<p>The finished set is roughly the same size as the 2012 Y-Wing which came before it. However, the construction and detailing has been dramatically improved! The cockpit area features a few significant changes, including some angled pieces in the snot build which now allow the sides of the build to taper out from the blaster cannons towards the back of the structure. The blaster turret on the roof is now connected with a friction pin, meaning it no longer rotates freely and can be locked into any position on its 360 degree firing arc. The flick fire missiles from the previous set have been removed, and in their place is a set of spring loaded missiles which rest underneath the cockpit. The build around it captures the structure of the cowling of the torpedo launcher on the film model, and the firing arc of the spring loaded shooters accurately matches the torpedo launchers of the ship seen on screen.&nbsp; Not to mention, there is retractable landing gear now, allowing the set to sit properly on display with its landing gear extended.</p>

<p>The bomb mechanism has been significantly upgraded with a rotating rack. All four &quot;bombs&quot; included in the set can be loaded into the rack, however the sets instructions recommend only two bombs at a time. They are held more securely than the prior iteration, and with a simple twist on a gear at the back end of the model, the bombs will drop out one by one from the bomb chute.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally the best improvement the model makes is in its color choice and greebling detail. The greeblies are off the chart in this one, almost rivaling the UCS standards, with more piping and rough surface detailing than any system scale Y-Wing before it! The SNOT used on the end of the nacelles to detail the engine outlet and have an open exhaust ring are very impressive.&nbsp;The small ice skate pieces used to detail the engine are also impressive, although a bit fragile to build. The colors are a more accurate blend of white, gray, brown, yellow and a dash of light blue than the previous sets. The blue color (turquoise I think?) is a relatively new color shade&nbsp;in Lego&#39;s modern collection, having been used in the early 2000&#39;s, retired, then recently re-released in the last few years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The small repair speeder was probably included to justify the increased price, however I think it looks great. I think its a good accessory build to have with the Y-Wing, and the crane and hooks can be used to either move the ordinance to and from the bomber or it can be used to lift R3 in and out of the astromech&nbsp;socket. As a small secondary build, its a fitting addition to the final set.</p>

<p><strong>Closing</strong></p>

<p>The previous Y-Wing from 2012 set a high bar; and this set flawlessly jumps over it, improving on all the minor flaws the last set had. From the improved bomb and missile mechanisms, the landing gear, the figures and other play features; this is a great toy. However for a collector, the near UCS detail jammed into this little model is superb. The Lego Rogue One sets were pretty spectacular already, but this one arguably beats them all with its connection to the OT; and high level of fidelity. For fans of the Y-Wing, this is a must buy set.</p>

<p>We get a new Y-Wing for 2017 and I am late to the party but regardless of when you get this set the building experience will be worth every penny.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s line up for our bomb run!</p>

<p><strong>Packaging and Contents:</strong></p>

<p>We get the now common 2017 packaging featuring the Rogue One Death Trooper as well as a pretty fun shot of the contents both front and back. The box is very big when seen straight on. Inside you should get 5 bags and one instruction manual and one sticker sheet with about 8 stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with a very good selection of Rebel Alliance figures and one I think most fans and children will enjoy having in their collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside Bag 1 we get 2 figures. Admiral Raddus and Moroff. Moroff&nbsp;got&nbsp;woefully low screen time in Rogue One but thanks to this set you can expand on his adventures as you see fit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Admiral Raddus gets outstanding prints front and back and some leg prints also. His head mould is very well executed in my copy and I love his skin tone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moroff continues this&nbsp;trend nicely with printing either side of him and legs. Though his heavy equipment makes it difficult to stand him correctly. I had to get a piece out of my collection to help him stay up. Still he looks amazing!</p>

<p>Bag 2 contains our Y-Wing pilot and sadly he is not unique. He also Pilots the official U-Wing Set for Rogue One it seems. Despite the cloning I like his prints but I feel he would have been better served with a red flight suit as he is a member of Gold Squadron not Blue Squadron. We also get an Astromech Droid. Sadly I cannot find his official designation but I love his looks, we get a trans smoke dome with a gun metal body and he looks awesome! Very aggressive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Our pilot is the only figure in this set with dual faces, one very confident and the other, well let&#39;s just say he probably just noticed about 20 TIE fighters chasing him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last bag in the set houses the last figure. The lone Imperial Stormtrooper who is tasked with taking down this armored and shielded and armed to the teeth Y-Wing bomber. You can do it Stormy! Go go! (/ &#39; . &#39; )/ !!!!</p>

<p>In all seriousness, despite his low odds he looks great with the more modern Stormtrooper printing. Though I do wish he came with a silver color hair piece cause that has got to be one very old former but still angry clone trooper at this point in the Star Wars time line.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build for this set was very enjoyable! Probably one of the more fun builds I have done in a while for a Star Wars set. In particular I was really taken by the cleverness of the build&#39;s engine pods. That entire assembly was outstanding and uses some very fun tecniques to get a good look for this type of craft. Best of all it was all achieved with virtually no specialized parts. The exhaust rigns at the back of the engines was particularly enlightening and fun to put together!</p>

<p>The designer/s also managed to squeeze so much detail on this thing. There are so many points of visual interest on this model that is I was gawking at it for hours after completion. It really did take me back.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>We get 2 models in this set and one is a small munitions loader. It is quite nondescript but looks actually very fast and sleek from low angles. It also helps to round out any hangar scene you may have or inspire you to make a hangar for your Y-Wing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4580/25197657308_d22d67948c.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>[img]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4577/25197657548_dfa422f12f.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>The main build itself, however, is the star and it does not disappoint. In fact it is pretty big! For a set with about 700 pieces the end result is bulky with most of parts going to the Y-Wing. It took over my light box completely, I could not get a shot of it properly housed inside of it, the thing is so big!</p>

<p>The left over parts from my copy of the set:</p>

<p>[img]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4738/25197659038_87cffb00ab.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>The model features 2 spring loaded shooters, 3 retractable landing gear, a working bomb bay which when done carefully can hold 3 munitions in the bomb housing and a space for your Astromech (though he is stuck in there sideways)</p>

<p>It also benefits from being a very solid build, most points of contact are sturdy and you can grab it from just about anywhere except the thin engine pod frame pieces though they are very sturdy for play regardless.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>Simply&nbsp;a blast! One of the better vehicles I have put together in the line and with a more than decent selection of figures. Worth every penny to be sure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My only gripes are superficial at best. I wish the spring loaded shooters were better hidden, I wish the chassis around the cockpit were a bit higher, I wish we got an extra trooper to play with too as just&nbsp;one&nbsp;seems like a bit of an after thought. Regardless, it never gets old to blast him with the Y-Wing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are in need of a great display piece or a toy for your small Star Wars fan this will do the job nicely. It manages to squeeze fun features and good looks into one very solid build&nbsp;and fun building experience.&nbsp;</p>

"Nookman8","2018-01-12T17:35:36.77Z","""Admiral, this is Blue Leader, standing by.""","<p>The Y-Wing has been a staple in the Star Wars series ever since &quot;A New Hope.&quot; Because of this, ever since the beginning of the Star Wars line, LEGO has produced multiple of them over the years. Not including any smaller models, this&nbsp;is their most recent outing. Does it stand up to the largest in the sub-theme or will it be just some more cannon fodder for the Empire?</p>

<h2><strong>The Box</strong></h2>

<p>Like many sets from late 2016 - mid 2017, the border of the box is a black color, with a Death Trooper helmet in the left corner. There also is a splotch of a light aqua-ish&nbsp;blue in that area along with some tiny TIE Fighters to the left of the trooper.</p>

<p>The box&nbsp;is rectangular in shape but its length isn&#39;t too long and it&#39;s height is a moderate size. As for the photos of the model, like usual, they are high quality and are nice to look at. The back just shows some features of the ship in the same quality.</p>

<h2><strong>The Instructions</strong></h2>

<p>Like the images on the box, the instructions are of high quality and are easy to follow. The only other thing in the manual is the advertisements in the back for Winter 2017 wave of Star Wars sets, the Rogue One Buildable Figures, the LEGO Force Awakens Video Game, and the Force Builder app.</p>

<h2><strong>The Parts</strong></h2>

<p>There&#39;s nothing too notable here. Really, there&#39;s just the printed cockpit, the R3 unit&#39;s domed head, Admiral Raddus&#39;s&nbsp;head, and Moroff&#39;s&nbsp;sandwich piece-like head that are interesting.</p>

<h2><strong>The Build</strong></h2>

<p>The build, like most LEGO sets, was fun and interesting most of the time. There&#39;s only one downside to it and that&#39;s the build of the engines and support pylons. It&#39;s very repetitive and time-consuming but, there is some clever techniques thrown in there.</p>

<h2><strong>The&nbsp;Minifigures</strong></h2>

<h3><strong>Y-Wing Pilot</strong></h3>

<p>While not a named character, it&#39;s always nice to get a generic minifigure once in a while. And he doesn&#39;t disappoint. His prints on the front and back of his earth&nbsp;blue torso are very accurate to Blue Squadron members&#39; uniforms. Not only that but LEGO put printing on the legs which is always a treat! He also comes with a generic black laser pistol.</p>

<p>The face print is well executed with one side having a smirk with an orange visor and mouth piece. The other shows him presumably&nbsp;shot down and about to crash as it&#39;s a gasping frown.</p>

<p>The helmet&#39;s also nice with the checkerboard pattern&nbsp;printing on the top of the front of it, the mold in general, and all the other&nbsp;miscellaneous prints on it. The only problem I could find with it is that it&#39;s a but loose but perhaps that&#39;s just my figure.</p>

<p>Overall, a minifigure that&#39;s useful but not the most&nbsp;interesting.</p>

<h3><strong>Admiral Raddus</strong></h3>

<p>Raddus&nbsp;is the third Mon-Calamari in LEGO, after Admiral Ackbar and a generic Rebel Mon Calamari and behind Quarrie. And I say he&#39;s up to par with Ackbar&nbsp;as his printing is of great magnitude! (*wink, wink*) The head mold and printing on it is brilliant&nbsp;and depicts Raddus perfectly! The printing on the back and front of the earth blue&nbsp;torso is wonderful, along with his leg printing!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only downside is his accessory, a black laser pistol, but, he didn&#39;t need anything too flashy anyway.</p>

<p>Overall, a very collectable&nbsp;and awesome minifigure!</p>

<h3><strong>Moroff</strong></h3>

<p>Moroff was a memorable side character in Rogue One mostly due to his design. And his transition to LEGO doesn&#39;t change much!&nbsp;</p>

<p>His white torso surprisingly has printing on the front and back of it with some&nbsp;fur detailing. The legs also have printing with some more fur and two pouches on either leg. He comes with a large brick-built backpack that seems faithful enough to the one from his movie design and his head is made of an halfway sandwich piece that covers the front of his torso but leaves the back without any cover. It&#39;s a neat little piece&nbsp;that you could go out of your way for.</p>

<p>So, Moroff is a great minifigure! If you see him&nbsp;for a good price online, I&#39;d say you should go ahead and buy him.</p>

<h3><strong>R3 Astromech Droid</strong></h3>

<p>Yet another generic minifigure is in this set but, like the Y-Wing pilot, isn&#39;t something to complain about. The astromech droid comes with some dark stone gray pieces making up his body and legs but his domed head is actually a transparent brown piece! His printing, like most astromech droid, suffices but can differ in quality due to the parts cylinder nature.</p>

<p>So, I&#39;d say this is something you can go out of your way to collect, especially if you do so with&nbsp;astromech droids!</p>

<h3><strong>Stormtrooper</strong></h3>

<p>Who doesn&#39;t love a good ol&#39; Imperial Stormie&#39;? While, yes, he doesn&#39;t stand much of a chance to anything else in the set, it&#39;s always nice to get one of these guys. After all, you can never have too much cannon fod- I mean Stormtroopers! Though, his design is the recent one from 2014 which, I find a bit too detailed. (In fact, I say a lot of figures from 2014 were that)</p>

<p>The torso has a lot more depth with the more darker&nbsp;lines in the armor and the legs have now have some knee armor printing. But, while those things are alright, the helmet is, like I said before, a bit overdone. The eyes are now a bit more squeezed together, the filter now is gray with vertical lines running down it, and now there&#39;s some gray&nbsp;polygons on each side of the helmet.</p>

<p>I&#39;d rather have the Stormtrooper design from 2008 but, hey, its something I can compensate for having one of these guys.</p>

<p>Underneath the helmet is ANGRY CLONE. Enough said. (What happened to the plain black heads?)</p>

<p>As for accessories, he comes with a generic black blaster rifle, which are always nice to come by.</p>

<p>So, I may have sounded a bit negative but, I still say the Stormtrooper is a great minifigure. Not as good as the 2008 design but still, sufficient&nbsp;and collectable.</p>

<h2><strong>The Completed Model</strong></h2>

<p>This is possibly the best LEGO Y-Wing you can get&nbsp;on the market right now. The designer on this set has made so many improvements over the last one! For example, just the front tip of the Y-Wing looks better with a bit of white now being there instead of it being completely&nbsp;yellow! Plus, the greebling&nbsp;in the center of the ship is fantastic.</p>

<p>The cockpit can handle one minifigure&nbsp;and has a small printed targeting screen in it. There&#39;s not too much to it but, it&#39;s nice nonetheless. The only downside to it is the turret above it. While, yes, it look nice, when pointed forward, you can&#39;t open the cockpit. But, hey, that&#39;s only a small design flaw.&nbsp;The astromech droid hold is alright. It doesn&#39;t stick out too much but, there could be a bit more detail to it.</p>

<p>The twin engines and pylons are also nicely detailed. The stickers on them aren&#39;t too hard to apply either so that&#39;s a nice bonus! Plus, yet again, the brick-built detailing and the design of disk vectrals are, like I&#39;ve said plenty before, amazing.</p>

<p>Back to the center of the ship is a cool little play feature. The set comes with four red tipped &quot;bombs&quot;, as LEGO calls them. There&#39;s a small little mechanism in the middle that can carry them all in between&nbsp;some gear teeth.There&#39;s a little knob in the back that, if you twist left or right, the gears move in that direction. Keep on turning and soon, a bomb will fall form the bottom of the ship. Neat!</p>

<p>As for additional features, I like&nbsp;the updated design for the laser cannons at the front of the ship. The landing gear are a nice touch, and where the &quot;action-feature laser bolts&quot; are located are a bit annoying if you ever decide to &quot;swoosh&quot; this thing around.</p>

<p>You would think I could go to the conclusion now but, there&#39;s actually a small little &quot;weapons loader&quot;. (Again, LEGO&#39;S words, not mine) There&#39;s not much to it but, it&#39;s still a nice little side build, albeit, not something that absolutely needed to be included.</p>

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>

<p>Like I said before, this is the best LEGO Y-Wing on the market. The wonderful design and the awesome minifigures prove that. The only faults of&nbsp;this beaut is the laser bolt locations and the turret not allowing the cockpit to open. But, they&#39;re really not that bad at all. Overall, a set all Star Wars fans of any age need to get. Now, get that <em>Solo</em> TIE Fighter set out LEGO! This ship needs some target practice!</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The Y-wing is a really good build. It looks really accurate to Star Wars and is based off of Rogue One but works for original trilogy too. There is a turret on top that can move and spring loaded shooters on the bottom that are not that noticeable. The astromech droid can fit in the top and this is a really detailed build that looks accurate and is also good for play. The side build is not needed but a nice addition, it doesn&#39;t add much to the whole set. 10/10</p>

<p>This set is great and the Y-wing is really detailed and accurate and is an overall great build. the minifigures are good and the price per piece is great for a Star Wars set. If you are a Star Wars fan then I recommend getting this set, it is definitely&nbsp;worth the price.</p>

We get a cool mol for an alien creature from Rogue One and we get Admiral Raddus who is a Mon Calamari but he is from the northern poles so he has a blue tinge to him. The pilot is also nice and its cool to get the navy jumpsuit and a new helmet print. The weird thing is the stormtrooper. There is just one and the rest of the set seems to take place at a rebel base. Not complaining about getting another stormtrooper because its a nice figure to throw in, I&#39;m just saying that its kinda weird.

"Brick1","2020-06-15T20:22:42.53Z","Y-Wing Review","<p>I was given a choice between having a Y-wing and having a U-wing for one of my birthdays a couple years ago and I still can&#39;t decide which one I like more even though I have built one and not the other.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with a wide range of 4 minifigures and 1 Droid. The Droid is a simple astromech&nbsp;droid with no notable importance (maybe he is important in some way bug not enough for me to care). The other minifigures include 3 rebels and 1 stormtrooper, just the way I expected it to be for a Lego set based around a rebel ship. The pilot has a nice torso and helmet, once again pretty standard for a rebel ship. The set also comes with admiral radius minifigure that I think looks great. The set also comes with a strange looking white furred creature which is an amazing minifigure but not nesecerally related to Y wings in any way. The creature does have an interesting backpack and gun.</p>

<p><strong>The Ship</strong></p>

<p>The ship is a pretty great mode. The detail around the engines and rear is amazing, and it has a play feature (an ability to drop bombs by twisting a gear at the rear). The ship can fit its pilot, the astromech droid, and 3 bombs. It does use a couple of large stickers on the cylinder pieces that make up the engine, but I can&#39;t think of a better way of modelling that. The ship also has 2 spring loaded shooters partially hidden from view located under the cockpit area. The ship is kinda delicate and my current model is falling apart (probably from a lack of care) but the delicateness&nbsp;doesn&#39;t&nbsp;help</p>

<p><strong>Extras</strong></p>

<p>This set also comes with a little yellow hovering crane and trailer which is meant for loading the ship with bombs (even though it doesn&#39;t work as you need to load them 1at a time but the frame can only hold 2 at a time) which is a nice addition. I would&#39;ve liked it to have one more small detachable trailer with a step ladder which would give the pilot a way into the cockpit but some slight modifications can change that. Overall a good set.</p>

"CaptainKindling","2020-09-26T17:23:51.46Z","Very nice ship, but not an enjoyable build.","<p>Rogue One&#39;s revitalisation of classic-era Star Wars ships gave&nbsp;us a new take on a set which had&nbsp;been out of production for a while: the Rebel Y-Wing fighter. Seen originally attacking the Death Star during A New Hope (and lost a little amongst the spectacle of the climactic battle of Return of the Jedi), the Y-Wing is the Rebel&#39;s heavy bomber, and was instrumental during the battle of Scarif.<br />
<br />
The set comes in a nice big box - big enough to make an adult feel like they&#39;re getting their money&#39;s worth, and to make a child&#39;s eyes pop out in excitement. Inside the box, the set is split across 5 numbered bags to make the build easier - something Lego tends to do with all of their larger sets, and is especially useful with the Y-Wing due to its fiddly nature (which I&#39;ll mention shortly).<br />

The build for me clocked in at just over 2 hours. I&#39;m always keen to get my hands on the finished model so tend to build in a hurry - anyone taking the build at a more leisurely pace could probably stretch it out for another couple of hours, and younger builders would probably need the best part of an afternoon/evening to get through the whole thing.<br />
This is where the Y-Wing loses a few points though, as it&#39;s not really a very enjoyable build. The first couple of bags are fine, making up the cockpit, the rear part of the body and the maintenance vehicle, but the engines are where things become tedious. At that point, the entire build becomes about rods, pegs, and sticker alignment. When building a Lego set there&#39;s something deeply satisfying about fitting big, chunky bricks together and seeing things take shape, but there is precious little of that with the Y-Wing build.<br />
Stickers are quite divisive amongst collectors - personally I can take them or leave them, but I know that many feel it detracts a little from the build. The Y-Wing doesn&#39;t have a wide variety of stickers as some sets do, but it does have four very large stickers which need to be carefully aligned to make the front half of the engine pods. A slight misalignment of these will be very noticeable as they combine to create a wraparound effect.<br />
<br />
Once the build is complete the Y-Wing is a very nice looking vehicle, and there a few little interactive parts to it. The lasers at the front of the ship can be fired by flicking the ends of the projectiles - again, this is a little disappointing as many of the Star Wars sets feature clever little devices to make them fire at a push of a button or turn of a lever, but here we&#39;re back to having the laser beams conspicuously protruding from the bottom of the cockpit for manual firing. Behind the cockpit, the Y-Wing can be loaded up with bombs through a small top hatch, and with a turn of the rear dial it can make bombing runs against Imperial installations (or the family dog). It also features three retractable landing struts, meaning it sits nice and stably on the shelf when not on missions.<br />
<br />
The minifigure selection is quite good. Obviously the ship needs a pilot and an astromech droid, so both of these are provided. You also get a classic Imperial Stormtrooper to target with your impressive firepower (just until you get that lovely Lego Death Star, obviously). Admiral Raddus is also provided, and was the highlight of the set for me - at this point the Y-Wing is the only set he&#39;s available in, so if you&#39;re a Raddus fan then this is the place to go. The only odd choice in the set is the inclusion of Moroff. As one of Saw Gerrera&#39;s goons, he&#39;s out of the picture completely by the Battle of Scarif, so it seems a bit random to throw him in with the rest of a Scarif-themed set.<br />
<br />
So to summarise - a nice looking model, just not really that fun to build. Young ones will undoubtedly need help with the large number of fiddly pieces and some of the brute force needed to slot the engines together.</p>

It has one of my favorite play features ever in LEGO where you can drop bombs, it provided tons of fun when I got it 4 years ago. It was also a great value, it&#39;s also not too expensive now and this is a set I wish to get more of.</p>

<p>thanks for reading!</p>
