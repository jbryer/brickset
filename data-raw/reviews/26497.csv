"Duq","2017-01-05T02:07:21.56Z","Not again? Only for completionists...","<p>If you own 8092 or 75052 then this landspeeder will look very familiar...</p>

<h3>Box &amp; Instructions</h3>

<p>This version of the Landspeeder is part of the Rogue One wave of sets so the box has a prominent Shadow Trooper in the corner. It shows the landspeeder, Luke being attacked by the Tusken Raider and Obi Wan coming to his rescue. For some reason C-3PO is holding binoculars.</p>

<p>The instruction booklet has 38 pages of instructions and a few pages at the back with pictures of other sets and minifigures from this year.</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>There are 4 minifigs in this set, and for some reason there&#39;s also a mouse...</p>

<p><strong>Obi Wan Kenobi</strong></p>

<p>This is the exact same Obi Wan as in 75052 Mos Eisley, which also appears in the re-issue of the Death Star. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a bad minifig of course; he has a nicely printed torso, front and back, and the print continues on the legs. He has no cloth cape.</p>

<p><strong>Luke Skywalker</strong></p>

<p>Luke&#39;s torso, legs and hair are also the same as in 75052 but the print on his face is slightly different.</p>

<p><strong>C-3PO</strong></p>

<p>His head has been around since 2012 and the legs were first used in the Sandcrawler. The torso print is 99% identical to that in the Sandcrawler, you almost need a magnifying glass to see the difference.</p>

<p><strong>Tusken Raider</strong></p>

<p>Nope, this one isn&#39;t unique either. It&#39;s the exact same design as in last year&#39;s 75081 Skyhopper.</p>

<p><strong>R2D2</strong></p>

<p>Hey, hang on, didn&#39;t I say there were only 4 minifigs? Indeed. Incredibly, there is no R2D2 in this set. Really, he should have been included as he is part of the scenes with the landspeeder and the sand people.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are 149 parts in this set but few are unique. The 2x2 &#39;macaroni&#39; tile is new this year and is put to good use here in dark red. The truncated cone is not a new part but is new in dark red. After that the most unusual pieces are the plates in nougat. The 4x4 quarter circles from the previous set have been replaced with 4x8 half circles.</p>

<p>There is a sticker sheet with 5 stickers and they are essential for the look of the model; the instrument panel, the engines and a small greeble at the back.</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>As I mentioned at the start, if you have built either of the previous two incarnations of the Landspeeder then you probably won&#39;t need the instructions as the build is 90% identical.</p>

<p>No interesting building techniques here. Most of the set is built studs-up, with only the engines attached sideways and upside down.</p>

<h3>The model</h3>

<p>I can&#39;t help but compare this model to its predecessor, so what are the differences?</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/617/31330470003_548f8b092a_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 489px;"" /></p>

<p><em>75173 on the left, 75052 on the right</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>The pattern on the front is now done with the new macaroni tiles</li>
	<li>There are dark red cones (droid heads) on the engines</li>
	<li>The middle engine is now attached with a hinge rather than a Technic pin</li>
	<li>The left engine is now dark grey like the other two</li>
	<li>The sticker in front of the windscreen has been replaced with a grille tile</li>
	<li>There&#39;s a gear stick in the cockpit.</li>
</ul>

<p>Seriously, that&#39;s it. Even the stickers have barely changed; the instrument panel and the greeble at the back are the same, the engine stickers have been changed to remove the dark red rings as they are now done with the cones.</p>

<p>The new way the middle engine is mounted is an improvement; it&#39;s a more stable connection. I like that the grille in front of the windscreen is now a grille tile again, not a sticker. The macaroni tiles also look very good for the decoration of the front.</p>

<p>However my biggest issues with the previous version have not been addressed; the damaged left engine is still done with stickers. I prefer the way that was done in 8092, with a different jet engine part. The seats should be removed to get the minifigs to sit a little lower into the speeder.</p>

<p>The dark red cones do a good job for the shape of the engines from the side, but they close the air intakes so they&#39;re a mixed blessing.</p>

<h3>Play functions</h3>

<p>It&#39;s very swooshable but apart from the storage at the back it has no functions or moving parts.</p>

<p>For acting out movie scenes R2D2 is sorely missed.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>For anyone who already has 8092 or 75052 I would say: don&#39;t bother. If you want to upgrade your existing landspeeder then order two dark red macaroni tiles on Bricklink, and maybe the dark red cones.</p>

<p>For anyone who doesn&#39;t have those sets and wants to have a Landspeeder I would say wait for the sales. At &euro;29.99 for 149 parts this set is grossly over-priced. Once you have bought it at a reduced price, get an R2D2 from Bricklink to complete the scene.</p>

"TK_1308","2017-01-11T18:02:53.527Z","""The Sand People are easily startled, but they'll soon be back, and in greater numbers.""","<p>Lego releases the first of it&#39;s kits to celebrate the 40th anniversary of A New Hope with Luke&#39;s SoroSuub X-34 Landspeeder.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>A small rectangular box for the kit. Ben Kenobi is the figure of choice on the top.&nbsp;<br />
The front shows Ben coming to Luke&#39;s rescue as he is attacked by the Tusken Raider. The back shows the trio escaping the Sand People while the Tusken Raider and his pet Womp Rat run away. There is a single panel showing the only play feature.<br />
There is one rectangular instruction book.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts<br />
The price per piece ratio is average for a kit this size. The pieces are primarily maroon red and the sand orange for the hull plating on the X-34 with some grey pieces thrown in.<br />
There are 2 bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains parts for the main forward hull of the landspeeder, C-3PO and Luke SKywalker.<br />
Bag 2 contains parts for the aft upper section, the engines and the detailing for the landspeeder, Ben Kenobi, the Tusken Raider and the womp rat.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The set comes with four minifigures.<br />
Luke Skywalker is a nice version of him in his Tatooine outfit. The detailing on the simple white tunic and trousers is nicely done. For some reason his trousers are white when a tan colour would be more accurate. His head has smiling and serious faces on it. He comes equipped with his electrobinoculars.<br />
Ben Kenobi is a great minifigure. Superb printing and detailing across the face, torso and legs make this version on of the best of the Jedi to date. The same as the 2014&#39;s version from the Mos Eisley Cantina and he comes equipped with his blue lightsaber.<br />
C-3PO is another nice figure but again, nothing new. The detailing across the minifigure is the usual high standard.<br />
Finally, my favourite, the Tusken Raider. Last seen in 2015&#39;s T-16 Skyhopper, we get another of one of the most neglected characters in the Star Wars saga. I rather like the new head piece and the detailing on the torso and legs in superb, especially with all the nice silver highlights on the pouch clips and breathing tubes. He comes armed with his gaffi stick and has a pet womp rat.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Total building time, 10 minutes.<br />
A very straightforward build with nothing to set it apart from previous version. A few cosmetic changes, which another reviewer has gone into detail so I won&#39;t repeat Duq&#39;s excellent work on highlighting them.<br />
The back section of the X-34 lifts off to reveal a small storage compartment.<br />
There are 5 stickers to apply; the control panel inside, detailing on the aft starboard plating and the three engines.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>Putting aside the reissue factor, the landspeeder is actually a nice kit. There&#39;s not a lot of play features and it&#39;s great for kids. A very driveable vehicle, especially across carpets with the clear discs underneath the X-34 making it glide really easily. It&#39;s solid, sturdy and looks good.<br />
Looks great on display with other Tatooine themed pieces too.<br />
The Landspeeder measures 18 cm long, 10 cm wide and 5 cm high.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>Yes, this kit is primarily a reissue of part of 2014&#39;s Mos Eisley Cantina with 2 other figures thrown in. The absence of R2-D2 is a glaring oversight. However, the set did give me a chance to get another of the new Tusken Raiders which is quite nice, and in a kit cheaper than his first release.<br />
As this is the 40th anniversary, it&#39;s not surprising that Lego would re-release one of the iconic vehicles from the film but it would&#39;ve been nicer to have added this to a larger set, maybe with Ben&#39;s home and a Bantha.<br />
If you have the previous releases, especially the Mos Eisley Cantina, then this is an easy miss for your collection but if you haven&#39;t got one yet, or you are a completist, or like me you really like the new Sand People, then definitely go for it.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2017-09-21T03:58:52.74Z","Solid Landspeeder For First Time Landspeeder Owners","<p>Luke&#39;s Landspeeder... One of the most famous Star Wars vehicles. Remade by Lego multiple times now, with very little changes between the last few versions. You would think somebody like me who has collected Lego Star Wars since the start would have a model of this vehicle by now? Well, nope... This is my first purchase of this vehicle in Lego ever. So while many bemoaned the fact the model was only slightly modified from its last appearance in 2014, I was kind of happy to get my hands on it finally after having missed every single previous incarnation. As a kid my grandparents had the Kenner Power of the Force landspeed for Star Wars action figures in their toy bin for their grandkids to play with at their house;&nbsp;so I have a soft spot for this vehicle due&nbsp;to my memories of that toy many years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigurs</strong></p>

<p>Considering most Star Wars Battlepacks are coming out for $15 USD right now with four figures, the fact we get four figures in this $20 set along with a nice model already makes this set feel a lot more substantial than most other Lego Star Wars sets on the market. For comparison the $30 Resistance Transport Pod that came out for The Last Jedi sets this year too only has two figures and a small astromech droid. The $20 Rey&#39;s Speeder from 2015&#39;s Force Awakens wave only came with two figures period! The four figures although somewhat common are great selections to recreate the scene in the canyon when Luke goes searching for the missing R2-D2 and is ambushed by Tusken Raiders. R2 is the only glaring ommision from the group, although he is currently available in Yoda&#39;s Starfighter and probably will be returning in 2018 in the Yoda&#39;s Hut set.</p>

<p><em>Luke Skywalker</em></p>

<p>My first Luke Skywalker figure since the 2007 Jabba&#39;s Sail Barge and my second rendition of him in his A New Hope clothes since the very first Millennium Falcon set! I am rather impressed, I know the level of printing is very standard for Lego now but there is something special about putting this new figure side by side with the old yellow faced figure from 2000 and seeing just how far Lego has come during the time I have been collecting! The hair piece is a perfect choice for the young farmboy look from that first film, and the double sided head is well done. My only complaint is the lack of accessories for the figure, the binoculars are nice but I would have liked to see him come with a Lego rifle or musket piece to represent the &quot;slug thrower&quot; he takes with him to face the Tusken Raiders in A New Hope.</p>

<p><em>&quot;Ben&quot; Kenobi</em></p>

<p>My second figure of Obi-Wan in my collection and the first I have of him in his &quot;Ben&quot; guise from A New Hope. Again very well detailed, and the inclusion of his lightsaber is a great accessory. My only complaint is the lack of a doublesided head for an alternate face for the figure.</p>

<p><em>Tusken Raider</em></p>

<p>This is my first Tusken Raider. A friend of mine as a kid had the old Tusken Raiders from 2002, and I am happy to say this new figure with his molded head is a great upgrade! The gaffi stick is well done too, and I can&#39;t wait to get more of these figures in the upcoming 2018 battlepacks.</p>

<p><em>C-3PO</em></p>

<p>The most common figure in the set is C-3PO.&nbsp;None of his parts have changed since the 2000-era figure I have, although his printing and color molding has been updated. Compared to the polybag Force Awakens 3PO, this one is a step down, considering he lacks the arm and leg printing his polybag counterpart has. Still, I am happy to have a &quot;original trilogy&quot; era Threepio as the Force Awakens one doesn&#39;t look to great in an OT display with that big glaring red arm! The small sliver of silver leg printing on the OT Threepio is a nice touch, although I&#39;d hope to someday see his silver leg done using dual-molded gold and silver parts.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Most of the build is a simple method of stacking plates and bricks onto each other, without a lot of SNOT involved. I will say, the best part is the way the two flex-tubes are loosely mounted to curve around the hood which I think was a rather genius method to achieve that grilled look. The finished model looks great. The cab interior is detailed and smooth, somehow conjuring images of 1960&#39;s American Muscle Cars strapped with&nbsp;the three jet engines on the back of the Landspeeder!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Overall the model is well done. It is much larger than some other $20 sets of late (looking at you Rey&#39;s Speeder!). The Landspeeder seats two figures in the cockpit, and C-3PO and an R2-D2 (provided by another set since he isn&#39;t included here) can be posed onto the back of the speeder similar to how they rode on it into Mos Eisely in A New Hope. The figure selection is well balanced, while it would have been nice to maybe see something more exclusive (Uncle Owen or Aunt Beru perhaps?) than the four somewhat common figures, the four figures selected recreate an iconic scene from the film. While the four figures might be common to some collectors, they were new to me; so I am not complaining! Getting this set makes me wish I had some sort of Tattoine Diorama to display it in... it just captures the feeling of the opening scenes of A New Hope so well. I&#39;d gladly recommend this to other Lego fans who have yet to get the Landspeeder as the best opportunity to obtain this iconic piece of Star Wars lore.</p>

"jamiesiddons97","2017-02-06T00:36:07.573Z","The Same, but Better","<p><b>Box/Instructions</b></p>

<p>Although the design of the very doesn&#39;t usually influence my impression of the set, I have to say the box of this particular set is very eye-catching. It sports the new Rogue One box art (despite not being a Rogue One set) and the art of the model itself captures the scene well and showcases both the build and minifigures.</p>

<p>The instruction booklet is small and very easy to follow, mine wasn&#39;t folded either, which is a bonus.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot of very useful parts in this model (if you prefer to break yours down), including a lot of dark red and flesh coloured pieces. A lot of pieces are new to this set as well, including&nbsp;the macaroni tiles on the front and some of the dark red domes.</p>

<p>Overall however, there aren&#39;t many parts that go into the build so buying the sole purpose of collecting rare pieces might not b very efficient.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>For a lot of people, including myself, the minifigures were a very big draw of this set. I had previously never owned a tusken raider nor the new C-3PO&nbsp;so they were a welcome addition to my collection. Also included are Obi-Wan and Luke, who also have new designs but are very commonly made characters.</p>

<p>As others have mentioned a would have appreciated a R2-D2 to complete the scene but having already owned multiple versions and the set being only 20 British Pounds, I can&#39;t complain too much.</p>

<p>The addition of a very small &#39;womp rat&#39; was nice but a bit unnecessary&nbsp;in my opinion.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The build is very simple and probably took about 15 minutes at most. Novice builders and children will have no problem building the majority of this set, with the only challenge coming when bending the bars around the front.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>I would have to say this is the best version of the landspeeder to date, although only by a margin. The inclusion of extra details such as the dark red domes on the turbines and the macaroni tiles help elevate this model to the top. There is still much to be desired for the windscreen as it doesn&#39;t really resemble to movie variant too well, a new mold would be great and could be incorporated into further sets such as a flash speeder.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>I really like this set. At such a low price and high minifigure count, there really isn&#39;t&nbsp;much to complain about. If you don&#39;t own the version from the Mos Eisley Cantina, then I would highly recommend this set because of the improvements it&#39;s made to the older versions.</p>

"dRevan","2017-12-29T02:28:24.7Z","""These are not the droid you are looking for""","<p>Luke&#39;s Landspeeder is one of the few Lego sets released in 2017 based on a New Hope movie.<br />
The set has 149 pieces, 4 figs and retails for $24.99 CAD</p>

<p>Minifigs:<br />
1. Luke Skywalker: The figure is identical to the one released with the 2016&#39;s Death Star. He has the wavy blond hair, and feature two faces: smiling and an annoyed/angry face. He is wearing a simple white tunic with a bold brown belt. He is equipped with a pair of macrobinoculars.&nbsp;<br />
2. Old Ben: The figure like Luke also appears in the Death Star. He comes with a classic hairpiece with a simple curve to one side. He has a very detailed face design with a grey beard and a kind expression. He is wearing a dark brown robe over his Jedi garb. The Jedi garb printing bleeds on the torso and is very pale. Back of the torso has the hood detailing. He is armed with a blue lightsaber.<br />
3. Tusken Raider: Sand People are a rare figure in Lego. This figure was first released in 2015. He has a fantastic head mold with the shiny silver points and two silver eyes. He is wearing a simple tan robe with a brown breathing apparatus printing. He is equipped with a Gaffi stick that has a rare light bluish grey ice cream cone piece.<br />
4. C-3PO: The iconic golden droid is among my favourites from the Star Wars universe. He has a molded head with crisp printing. He has the colourful power-bus cables printed on his torso akin to other protocol droids.</p>

<p>Build:<br />
The Landspeeder is one of the iconic and instantly recognizable vehicles from Star Wars and has been rendered almost perfectly in Lego.&nbsp;<br />
The build is very simple and straightforward and is very similar to the 2014&#39;s Landspeeder released in the Mos Eisley Cantina. The main difference is the inclusion of the macaroni tile pieces in dark red for the curved U in front of the windscreen. The seamless tiling is perfect IMO. The cockpit features seats for 2 people, stickered console and a steering wheel. The build has three engines topped off with a dark red R5 dome head piece. This looks very good as well. Each engine is stickered and the left one has the cover ripped off revealing the wiring.<br />
Behind the cockpit is a small storage space where you can place the lightsaber(dismantled) and the binoculars. Underneath the speeder are 8 inverted trans-clear pieces used to provide a smooth sailing over carpeted surfaces.</p>

<p>Overall:<br />
This set is perfect! $25 for 4 figs plus an iconic build is more than I can ask for. The build has been almost perfectly captured in Lego form and looks very sleek. A modification could be an accurate windscreen however.&nbsp;<br />
The inclusion of a Womp rat is very cool IMO even if its a regular Lego rat.&nbsp;</p>

"Griffin_Kidwell","2018-02-18T00:28:38.27Z","Great Set, But No R2-D2?!","<p>I bought this set for $19.99 at my local Wal-Mart, and it does not disappoint! Except maybe the exclusion of R2-D2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is a nice, quick one, with the only really difficult section being getting the stickers onto the engines. While the parts selection is not the most varied, it gets the job done well with a nice level of detail and a high playability level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs are very nice, (except once again for the distinct lack of R2-D2), and I am particularly impressed with Luke Skywalker, who looks nothing like that horrifying version in the 2014 Sandcrawler. The Tusken&nbsp;Raider is very nice as well, and if I am not mistaken this is only the second time we have gotten one with this molded head. Obi-Wan is the spitting image of the late Alec Guiness, with his subtle torso&nbsp;detailing, and the&nbsp;grayish-white beard.</p>

<p>The Landspeeder itself is a very sturdy build, strong enough to withstand play while not looking too bulky. This set doesn&#39;t have too many stickers, thankfully, and the stickers that are here really help the look and are critical to the set&#39;s details.</p>

<p>Overall: 10/10 Having missed the 2014 Mos Eisley Cantina, I was ecstatic when this&nbsp;was revealed&nbsp;so I&nbsp;could get a landspeeder without the hefty pricetag.</p>

<p>Building Experience: 10/10 Not too difficult of a build and very quick to finish.</p>

<p>Parts: 9/10 Not the most varied of selections but the new colors do help cancel out the bland parts.</p>

<p>Playability: 10/10</p>

<p>Value For Money: 10/10 The PPP is rather high, but the finished model is large enough that it justifies the $19.99.</p>

Anyway, this portion of the build is very quick and easy, a lot more stickers to place here for the engine detailing. Overall the build throughout both bags is very fun and engaging unless you&rsquo;ve already built this model in previous releases of the sets, then it will just be very repetitive with few minor changes to the model.</span></span></span></span></p>

If you don&rsquo;t already own this model it&rsquo;s nice to see it being released again for folks to buy. Interestingly enough each release of this model has referenced a different scene in the movie, the 1999 set represents them heading to Mos Esiley, the 2010 set includes a Sandtrooper and so they are already at Mos Eisley, the 2004 and 2014 Cantina sets include the Landspeeder parked outside and this set from 2017 represents the first meeting of Luke and Ben during that moment when the Tusken&rsquo;s attacked him near the rocks on Tatooine.</span></span></span></span></p>

However, as I said, it&rsquo;s pretty safe to skip this release if you already own the model in any of the other releases of this particular model. Recommended to folks who haven&rsquo;t bought one already.</span></span></span></span></p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-07-01T17:09:25.533Z","Simple","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Luke&#39;s landspeeder&nbsp;is one of the more iconic vehicles of Star Wars - and hence one I liked to get for my collection. The build was OK, quick and easy. By far the most tricky part is applying the stickers to&nbsp;the three engines, as the engines&nbsp;are round and the stickers are highly visible, and it is easily spotted if they are not lined up properly. To me - admittedly NOT a Star Wars purist - this set does what it is supposed to do: looking like Luke&#39;s landspeeder. The four minifigures are nice, and yes, I have seen the complaints about R2-D2 not being included in this set. Personally I am not bothered by it. The big problem with this set - especially for continental Europe - is the price. Asking&nbsp;30&nbsp;euros for this set is simply indefensible.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>Building this set is easy and rather quick. As mentioned above, applying the three stickers on the angines is the most tricky part (and - using Glassex/Windex - actually took as much&nbsp;time as&nbsp;putting the set together). I liked the way the speeder is designed, including the use of flexitube, and the attachment of the compartment and top engine. Off-colour pieces are nicely hidden inside.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>None of the four included minifigures are unique to this set. Personally I like them, with the Tuscan Raider being my favourite. All prints seem to be nicely in register.</p>

<p>Luke has a good looking print on the torso (front and back) that is nicely continued on the legs. He also has two face prints, one a more determined, the other a more unhappy expression.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obi Wan has only one face print, and a very nice print of him wearing a long mantle - at least on the front of his legs. It would have looked better if that print had continued on the side and back of the legs, IMHO.He only has one face print, but it is a nice one of him wearing a beard.</p>

<p>The Tuscan Raider is my favourite minifigure of this set. The print on the front of his torso is continued nicely on his legs. The print of the&nbsp;double belt with pouches is continued on the back of the torso. His head is a hard plastic one piece, with multiple colours&nbsp;and very nice texture. I think it is extremely well done.</p>

<p>C3PO&nbsp;is another well done minifigure; the brown/silver/black printing on a pearl gold torso and legs works well. His head is also hard plastic. His eyes &#39;stare&#39; a bit (&#39;deer in headlights&#39;- look), but that is probably unavoidable due to the printing techniques.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>As said in the summary, to me the vehicle looks like a landspeeder.&nbsp; The engines are well integrated into the body, I generally like the colour&nbsp;palette, and the mixture of plate and tile/smooth bars and the stickers make for a good texture. The proportions also seem OK to me. Overall, it looks like a well-finished product - I certainly do not see obvious places where improvements to the design can be made.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>IMHO this set is a nice play set. The speeder is very swooshable (not in the least due to the 2x2 clear sliders underneath) The storage compartment works well, and there are enough minifigures to play out various scenarios. As a display set this one falls short IMHO:&nbsp;it is nice, but simply too small.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>This is a nice set and overall IMHO a pretty good set. The in big problem I have with this set is its price. The European prices - UK but especially those on the continent - are simply indefensible. The US price is acceptable (though still quite&nbsp;high, IMHO). The general quality of the vehicle, and the four included minifigures&nbsp;simply do not justify such a price tag. Personally, I can only recommend this set if found (in Europe) at a serious discount (25-30% off at a minimum).</p>

"CaptainKindling","2020-09-26T17:27:40.18Z","The Jundland Wastes are not to be travelled lightly...","<p>The landspeeder was&nbsp;one of the smaller sized sets from the Rogue One run of Lego, and at around 150 pieces it&#39;s actually small even by these standards. This took me roughly 25 minutes to build, so even young Lego fans would be able to put this together in a short amount of time.<br />
The build is extremely straightforward; the landspeeder is such a basic model that there were no complicated steps, fiddly mechanisms or awkward pieces. For such a small set though it is quite sticker-heavy, which may put off some collectors and cause a slight struggle for particularly young builders.<br />
<br />
Once assembled it&#39;s certainly a nice looking model, but kids might be disappointed by the lack of interactive parts. The rear of the speeder can be easily removed to store Luke&#39;s magnoculars and Obi-Wan&#39;s lightsaber, but that&#39;s where the interactive features end. Obviously it&#39;s effectively just a car and didn&#39;t do much in the movie, but a better &quot;hovering&quot; mechanism might have been a nice touch. The Rogue One Hovertank does the job by featuring transparent wheels which allow for it to be rolled across flat surfaces, but the landspeeder simply has a scattering of domed pieces on the underside of the vehicle to lift it up slightly.<br />
<br />
The minifigure selection is fantastic, and my main reason for buying this set! For a small &pound;20 set you&#39;re getting a great range. Obviously Luke&#39;s landspeeder wouldn&#39;t be complete without Luke himself, and for the first time in a while old &quot;Ben&quot; Obi-Wan Kenobi is available at a decent price. You also get C-3PO, a Tusken Raider, and a Womp Rat. Lego do enjoy including a &quot;bad guy&quot; in with their sets, hence the Tusken Raider, but I can&#39;t help but think it would have been nicer to include R2-D2 instead, completing the group for their Mos-Eisley run.<br />
<br />
Altogether, a nice looking little model and wonderful minifigure selection, but I&#39;d have to knock off a star for the lack of interactive parts, the very short build time, and the criminal lack of R2-D2.</p>
