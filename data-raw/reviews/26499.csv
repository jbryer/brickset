<p>I bought this set yesterday for 71.50&euro; and when I got home I started building straight away. Building the TIE Silencer is fun until you have to make 4 wings that are all the same but 2 of them are in reverse. It isn&#39;t really that horrible but you get the point.</p>

<p>I really like how this set looks. It reminds me of the UCS Tie Interceptor from roughly 15&nbsp;years ago.</p>

<p>MINIFIGURES:</p>

<p>Kylo Ren: The new Kylo&nbsp;Ren figure has very nice printing on the torso,&nbsp;legs and face. He has a double-sided face in which one has a neutral face and the other one is an angry face. The lightsabre hilt for some reason has been changed from the metallic black to a simple black color, even though it didn&#39;t get destroyed in TFA.</p>

<p>Overall rating: 9,7/10</p>

<p>First Order Special Forces Tie Fighter Pilot: Wow that&#39;s a long name... Anyway this minifigure is great, it has great printing on the torso but the helmet - is goddamn precious. The helmet has two red stripes coming down to the jaw and makes the figure look even more awesome.</p>

<p>I wonder why this wasn&#39;t included in the 75101 Special Forces Tie Fighter set in 2015.</p>

<p>Overall rating: 9/10</p>

<p>BB-9E: BB-9E&nbsp;is a great new droid to add for your collection. The head has a different mould than BB-8, it&#39;s angular instead of circular. The body is the same but in black but the prints are the same on each for sides. A very nice minifigure&nbsp;to get but I wish it would have some scuffs in the printing.</p>

<p>Overall rating: 8,8/10</p>

<p>First Order Stormtrooper: The First Order Stormtrooper&nbsp;is the same one we&#39;ve had from 2015 but that&#39;s good because it looks really great. So - yeah.</p>

<p>Overall rating: 8/10</p>

<p>THE TIE SILENCER:</p>

<p>The Tie Silencer looks awesome from any angle you look at it but I suggest putting it on a shelf with a stand, and point it to your left. The way you shoot the projectiles is very neat because instead of them being outside the ship just hanging there, they are inside the build and can be shot by pressing a button on the center of the build.</p>

<p>The wings can be placed in whatever angle you like. The cockpit is very nice and gets red light inside because of the red window piece.</p>

<p>I just wish this set would be 61.50&euro;/&pound;/$ but it has large parts so I think that might be the reason it&#39;s a bit overpriced.</p>

<p>OVERALL RATING: 9,5/10</p>

"LSWFan","2017-11-21T15:19:09.93Z","Ren's Ride","<p>Kylo Ren&#39;s TIE Fighter, or TIE Silencer as it appears to be officially known (I suspect LEGO were not aware of this moniker when they were putting the set together), features in the upcoming movie The Last Jedi and shows a significant departure from the First Order&#39;s standard TIE Fighters.</p>

<p>The design is reminiscent of a squashed down TIE Interceptor from Return of the Jedi and mercifully, the predominant colour featured is black rather than the ubiquitous Star Wars grey.&nbsp; Obviously, there is some grey, but it is used well to break up the black and add detail.</p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t expecting much from the build but actually it was really good.&nbsp; The cockpit section has very striking red windows and accommodates a single minifigure&nbsp;There&#39;s a really nifty firing mechanism for the two spring-loaded missile launchers, which are well hidden away in the build and not obviously sticking out as is the case in some other Star Wars models (I&#39;m looking at you <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75177-1/First-Order-Heavy-Scout-Walker"">First Order Heavy Scout Walker</a>).&nbsp; I was worried about the wing building being a little tedious, but the parts quantity is low enough that it didn&#39;t feel like too much of a chore, plus the guns built into the wings add more interest.</p>

<p>Once completed, it&#39;s a great model and surprisingly big.&nbsp; The design looks reasonably faithful to the ship we&#39;ve seen briefly in the movie trailer.&nbsp; The model has good &quot;swooshability&quot; and isn&#39;t likely to break apart under some rigorous play.</p>

<p>There are three minifigures plus a droid included in the set.&nbsp; First up is Kylo&nbsp;Ren, who of course is the pilot of Kylo&nbsp;Ren&#39;s&nbsp;TIE Fighter (or Silencer).&nbsp; He has seen some redesign since his debut in 2015&#39;s The Force Awakens LEGO sets.&nbsp; His outfit now features a chainmail-looking design and his face (on a two-sided head) is scarred following his battle with Rey in the earlier film.&nbsp; There is also no helmet included in the set, presumably as Ren is seen destroying it in the movie trailer it doesn&#39;t survive long into the film.</p>

<p>LEGO have included their new cloth cloak with the figure, which is such a massive upgrade on the old papery design of many years.&nbsp; It also makes Ren a lot easier to sit inside the TIE&#39;s cockpit.&nbsp; Overall, it&#39;s a great-looking figure with some nice changes making it different from the earlier version.</p>

<p>Next up we have a First Order TIE Fighter Pilot.&nbsp; This character continues to be a masterpiece of design wasted in scant seconds of movie time, mostly just there to be blown out of the sky or space by some Resistance do-gooder.&nbsp; He hasn&#39;t changed much since earlier LEGO sets, however the red stripes on his uniform and helmet are a welcome addition.</p>

<p>We also get a Stormtrooper.&nbsp; If you are any kind of LEGO Star Wars fan, chances are you already have a few of these and this one is as good as the rest.&nbsp; Not much more to say about him, really.</p>

<p>Finally, the droid included in the set is BB-9E, who appears to be the &quot;evil&quot; BB-8 of The Last Jedi.&nbsp; His body design is the same as the cute little Resistance droid, but coloured black (obviously) and he has a different head piece which is not as rounded as BB-8&#39;s.&nbsp; He looks fine, although still suffers from the connector at the bottom of the body which I still don&#39;t like as it makes the droid sit up in the air and looks odd.</p>

<p>As with all LEGO Star Wars sets nowadays, Kylo Ren&#39;s&nbsp;TIE Fighter is expensive for what it is.&nbsp; Although it&#39;s a well-designed and sturdy vehicle, it isn&#39;t the most complex creation you&#39;ve ever seen (not the designers&#39; fault, that&#39;s just how the fighter is) and with the&nbsp;relatively small minifigure&nbsp;count, it feels over-priced at &pound;75.&nbsp; The box is pretty big and I can&#39;t help but wonder if this is used for some greater justification of the price point.</p>

<p>But that&#39;s how it is and things seem unlikely to change whilst demand is high for these sets.&nbsp; Assuming you&#39;re happy to stump up the cash (or can find it discounted), I highly recommend the TIE Silencer.&nbsp; It looks great and although the minifigures are sparse, they are as good as ever.</p>

"A_Brickset_user","2018-07-19T13:55:24.26Z","Fantastic Lego Set","<p>First, I&#39;ll start by saying that I didn&#39;t enjoy The Last Jedi as much as other people have. I did enjoy all of the space battles in it that The Force Awakens sadly left out. Among the ships used in the film was Kylo Ren&#39;s Tie Silencer, my personal favourite. I love how agile it was, how sleek it looked, and I also loved the resemblance to the Tie Interceptor from the original trilogy.</p>

<p><strong>Building the Model</strong><br />
The build was more involved than I expected. There were a few building methods that I hadn&#39;t used much, if at all, before this set. The wings are a bit repetitive, but I don&#39;t mind seeing as though the build is only part of the experience as my kids and I will play with it and then it&#39;ll be displayed in between&nbsp;play sessions.</p>

<p><strong>Durability</strong><br />
The model is a surprisingly heavy and sturdy build. When the kids dropped it when playing with it, only the tips of the wings broke off, and those are easily reattached using the other wings as reference.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
I&#39;m a bigger fan of the Stormtroopers from the original trilogy, but I loved finally getting of the First Order Stormtroopers. My kids loved BB-9E, and the Kylo Ren character is good to have due primarily to his unique lightsaber. I do wish that it came with his mask from the beginning of the film though. The Tie Fighter pilot is good to have in case you want someone else to fly the ship.</p>

<p><strong>End Verdict</strong><br />
Overall this is a great model with great mini-figures and a great price-per-piece at the $50 I payed for it in-store at Walmart Canada. I had been wanting this set when it was full price but couldn&#39;t justify it. Now having it, I&#39;m glad I have added it to my collection for the price I did.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>The core of the ship is built around a technic block and is very solid indeed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I really like the brick built seating in the cockpit which does away with the regular moulded seat.&nbsp; The laser blasters are really nicely integrated as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is some really nice greebling and printed pieces.&nbsp; The colour scheme is also great with a mixture of LBG, DBG and pearl silver which all really enhance the overall look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are only 2 stickers which I did not apply so very happy about that!</p>

<p>Finally some recent newer pieces make an appearance (1x1 with 2 studs on corner) which are nice and I love the dark transparent red cockpit canopy piece!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It does get a little repetitive in places though due to its symmetrical shape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs</p>

<p>BB-9e only appears in 2 sets so far and is a nice addition to the set even though you don&rsquo;t see it in the same sequence as this ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Kylo Ren is an updated version with facial scarring which looks great and pretty consistent with the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You also get an FO Tie pilot even though he doesn&rsquo;t fly this ship and finally your ubiquitous FO Stormtrooper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conclusion&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes! Yes!! Yes!!!&nbsp; The ship/build comes together so nicely. There are no gaps, and you end up with a very swooshable space ship. The designers have done a really great job here. Highly recommend it &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is right up there with some of the coolest Lego SW vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Are there any weaknesses? Just one - I have 2 boys and they both want one!!</p>

"CC_2224","2017-12-31T01:37:51.12Z","Attractive, Functional, Durable, Accurate, and Easy to Play With","<p>Kylo Ren&#39;s TIE Fighter 9 (Officially called the TIE/vn Space Superiority Fighter, and colloquially referred to as the TIE Silencer) ia made very accurately it terms of shape, scale, and especially color scheme. Like the rest of Lego&#39;s recent TIE series, it is made very durable and solid. Like it did in the film, the Silencer looks&nbsp;eye-piercing and &#39;slick&#39;. The spring loaded shooters are expertly concealed, and the minifigures are very well-made&nbsp;and appropriate.</p>

<p>The building experience of this set was good, with only 2 smaller stickers, there was not much to worry about, and the whole build was straightforward. The only problem is a common one in the TIE series, and that is building something twice. In this case, building two things (Two orientations of winglets) twice. Overall, there was nothing really to complain about.</p>

<p>The parts in&nbsp;this set were all nice pieces, the printed windscreens were a huge help as opposed to stickers, and there was great detail all over the craft. The vessel&nbsp;had accurate color detail to the movie which was emulated well.</p>

<p>This set has all the features it needs to be playable. One can hold, move, and rotate the craft easily with their hand, and fire the bolts from the craft. Nothing else is necessary because the Silencer does not do anything else in the film.</p>

<p>The value of this set is not the best. At 12.7 cents per piece in the United States, it is okay for a Star Wars set. But for such an amazing set I think it is worth it if one has the budget for it.</p>

<p>The minifigures in this set, while they are not representative of the scenes in the film, are all great. The First Order Stormtrooper is&nbsp;the standard issue provided since Fall 2015 that was always good. The BB-9E droid is accurate to the one in the movie in both its unique shape and print. The new Elite TIE Fighter Pilot is expertly detailed, and even though it wouldn&#39;t be inside the craft, it is still good to have as a minifigure, and it adds to the value of the set. The highlight is the new and currently exclusive Kylo Ren minifigure. Sporting a new scar on his face, no helmet, and a full cape, this version of Kylo Ren suits his appearance and developed character in the most recent Star Wars film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a very good set. It has no major or standout flaws,&nbsp;it is made accurate to the movie, and it looks good in general. The value of this set may not be the best on paper, but it shouldn&#39;t take away from the quality of the model. This is a great set for collectors, Star Wars fans, and general Lego enthusiasts.</p>

"Lego_Jedi","2019-07-14T16:50:25.163Z","Kylo Ren’s Tool of Evil","<p>As conflicted as Kylo&nbsp;Ren is between the dark and light, he had amazing resources. Such is his Tie Fighter. This set is amazing! The overall structure of the build provides a pleasing sturdiness. It&rsquo;s swooshable for play and comes with awesome minifigures. I have only one question. What took me so long to finally build this set? Thanks Lego.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-07T23:15:28.85Z","Let the past die, kill it if you have to","<p>This is a very cool ship and a big step up from the last ship that was Kylo Ren&#39;s. The sleek lines with the color main color black with a outline of dark gray with the accents of transparent every so often, it just looks so cool. It has the wider cockpit and a wider viewport, but it has the angled wings like the TIE Interceptor. It also gives off the vibe similar to Vaders TIE Advanced. BB-9E is very cool to get in this and Kylo Ren is cool as well. The First Order Stormtrooper is a nice throw in and you can put the First Order Special Forces TIE Piolet o fly instead of Kylo Ren if you wan to. I would highly recommend this set to anyone who likes Star Wars.</p>
