It may have no play features but if you like collecting the racing cars then this is a good little set to have. It's very sturdy and the built is very easy as well. You also get two flames on the back of this car which makes this little set looking cooler. We also get a comic book in this set and you won't have to worry about stickers, too. I also can't complain about the minifig who comes with this vehicle. It's a cool little set but I would recommend you to buy the bigger LEGO Studios sets first before you plan to get this little model.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
Here is the link where you can check out the full gallery I made for this set
