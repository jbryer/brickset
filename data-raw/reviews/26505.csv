I&#39;ve included comments on both the base and combined models where I thought it was appropriate.</p>

<h3>Box / Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is standard and features a pic of the combination 42058 / 42059: Power Racer model on the rear side. The combination models are a nice selling point for me and this model in particular caught my eye. The instructions are clear as usual.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Pretty standard parts in this set as far as the simpler Technic models go. &nbsp;The use of colour&nbsp;in this set is&nbsp;nice but I couldn&#39;t help thinking a black / gray palette would have been preferable (of course that&nbsp;would probably have brought it&nbsp;too close to some of the Batman models).&nbsp; I believe there were 8 stickers and all were easy to apply. The inclusion of the ramp in the 2017 pull-back models is a nice addition. The ramp is made of a good solid poly plastic kind of material that holds up well to use and even being stepped on. Two small rubber &#39;beams&#39; are included that friction-anchor the ramp to the floor quite well and prevent it from slipping during use.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p><strong>Base</strong>&nbsp;- The build went smoothly and was pretty intuitive given previous experience with pull-back racer models. It&#39;s easy enough to get the bike into play within 15-20 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Combined</strong>&nbsp;- The combined build is certainly more challenging than the base build. More pieces means more patience and attention to detail is required. It&#39;s not a build you want to rush because it&#39;s easy to miss something.</p>

<h3>Completed Model</h3>

<p><strong>Base</strong>&nbsp;- A good-looking model but it didn&#39;t wow me. &nbsp;As you&#39;d expect with only two wheels, balance is an issue when trying to send the model over the ramp but the wide tires compensate for that pretty well. &nbsp;It did prove frustrating for my 5-year old during play. &nbsp;The model takes its share of abuse and I have yet to have to make any field repairs.</p>

<p><strong>Combined</strong>&nbsp;- Wow! The Power Racer model looks great with an aggressive profile and it moves! My son practically started drooling when he saw it. Very solid.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Unless you&#39;re set on the motorcycle design, I&#39;d definitely suggest going with the 42059: Stunt Truck instead. &nbsp;This is a nice model in it&#39;s own right but, for me, it just doesn&#39;t have the aesthetic appeal and play value of the 4-wheeled model. &nbsp;However, it&#39;s worth picking up in order to be able to build the combined model if you can swing it.</p>
