<h3>Box / Instructions</h3>

<p>The box&nbsp;is standard&nbsp;and features a pic of the combination 42058 / 42059: Power Racer model on&nbsp;the rear side. &nbsp;The combination models are a nice selling point for me and this model in particular caught my eye. &nbsp;The instructions are clear as usual.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Pretty standard parts in this set as far as the simpler Technic models go. &nbsp;I found the use of colours&nbsp;in this set really nice with a clean, sporty look. &nbsp;I believe there were 8 stickers and all were easy to apply. &nbsp;The inclusion of the ramp in the 2017 pull-back models is a nice addition. &nbsp;The ramp is made of a good solid poly plastic kind of material that holds up well to use and even being stepped on. &nbsp;Two small rubber&nbsp;&#39;beams&#39; are included that friction-anchor the ramp to the floor quite well and prevent it from slipping during use.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p><strong>Base</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The build went smoothly and was pretty intuitive given previous experience with&nbsp;pull-back racer models. &nbsp;It&#39;s easy enough to get the truck into play within 15-20 minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Combined</strong>&nbsp;- The combined build is certainly more challenging than the base build. &nbsp;More pieces means more&nbsp;patience and attention to detail is required. &nbsp;It&#39;s not a build you want to rush because it&#39;s easy to miss something.</p>

<h3>Completed Model</h3>

<p><strong>Base</strong> - As mentioned above, I think the colour&nbsp;scheme and overall aggressive look of the truck give this&nbsp;model a pretty authentic&nbsp;extreme-sport feel. &nbsp;My 5-year old calls it the &quot;chunky truck&quot; because it&#39;s very solid and the oversize tires make it virtually impossible to tip over during play. &nbsp;The model &nbsp;takes its share of abuse and I have yet to have to make any field repairs.</p>

<p><strong>Combined</strong>&nbsp;- Wow!&nbsp; The&nbsp;Power Racer model looks great with&nbsp;an&nbsp;aggressive profile and it moves! &nbsp;My son practically started drooling when he saw it. &nbsp;Very solid.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>This a great example of the pull-back racer models and is a worthy addition to a collection. &nbsp;The stunt truck more than stands on its own but, if you can swing it, definitely think about picking up the 42058: Stunt Bike at the same time so you can build the combined model.</p>
