Like all of the small technics it has a lot more functions than you would think. I was a good size, maybe a little bit bigger than I expected. The best function is probably&nbsp;working the crane on the digger.</p>

As the smaller sets appear to have A and B instructions included I decided to build the B model &quot;Mini Gritter with Plow&quot; to see what it will be like before parting out the set.</p>

<p>This vehicle will probably never win a price for being good looking. However, it is full of functions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Articulated steering (HoG)</li>
	<li>Tilting of loading space (worm screw)</li>
	<li>Unloading of loading space by means of wide track</li>
	<li>Lowering and raising of plow by lever</li>
	<li>Adjust angle tilting angle of plow</li>

<p>As an entry set, this small truck is packed with features that demonstrate the diversity of transferring mechanical input into an action.</p>
