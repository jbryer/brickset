<h3>Box</h3>

<p>I bought the set on the internet. The box is surprisingly big. It gives a good impression of the size of the A model. However, it is only about 50% filled. Parts are packed in four bags. The shovel is loose.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.boverhaus.de/~fafnir/foren/brickset/42061/IMG_6484k.jpg"" style=""width: 320px; height: 259px;"" /></p>

<p>There are printed instructions for the telehandler and a tow truck. I will give brief comments on the latter below.</p>

<p>There is also a small sticker sheet.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The following parts appear to be new respectively new color:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Bucket</li>
	<li>Connector 3L with two axle pins</li>
	<li>Worm gear 1L (dark stone grey)</li>
	<li>Axle 4L and 10L in red. The printed inventory has a mistake as it lists the length as &quot;9&quot;.</li>
	<li>Axle with stopper 3L and 5L in brown</li>
	<li>Axle 7L in yellow (not in picture because I didn&#39;t realise that these are new)</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.boverhaus.de/~fafnir/foren/brickset/42061/IMG_6498k.jpg"" style=""width: 320px; height: 231px;"" /></p>

<p>Benefit: Set comes with 49.5 x 20 tyres (56x26 do not fit under the fenders).</p>

<p>The new 1L worm gear seems to be made for the outrigger pieces. It also matches with 20 tooth gear (3 studs apart). It does not seems to fit with the 12 tooth gear.</p>

<h3>Build, Functions</h3>

<p>It took me about 40 minutes to assemble the A model (including some photos).<br />
The most interesting part is the four wheel steering that is achieved by three levers, e.g. without any gear wheel.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.boverhaus.de/~fafnir/foren/brickset/42061/lenkung.jpg"" style=""width: 480px; height: 318px;"" /></p>

<p>Many of the parts are used for wheel covers, drivers cabin and other decoration. The arm with shovel has just enough elements to get the motional functions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Boom raising and lowering</li>
	<li>Boom extension</li>
	<li>Shovel tilting</li>
</ul>

<p>I would guess that its reach is higher that that of <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8283-1"">8283</a></p>

<h3>Rating</h3>

<p>The model works pretty well for its size and number of parts.As the manipulators (small axle joiners) for extension and tipping are on the boom I&nbsp; took off points from playability.</p>

<h3>B Model</h3>

<p>The B model appears to have steering as well as adjustable height and length of the crane arm. While the cabin is quite detailed, the back is just an empty space.</p>

"darkshadow79","2017-02-03T17:35:01.47Z","A great true-to-life telehandler","<p>A welcome addition to the current Technic lineup. &nbsp;The 42061 Telehandler is a small-medium size,&nbsp;compact model that showcases everything that a real life telehandler performs. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The features include a boom that raises via a small linear actuator cylinder, a unique way of extending the boom outwards with a new 1-length worm screw, and a gear-operated mechanism that tilts the bucket up and down, as well as working steering. &nbsp;Every function works flawlessly and smoothly. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Put it all together with an eye-catching dark grey and red color scheme and kids and adult fans alike will enjoy not only playing with the telehandler but displaying it as well. &nbsp;</p>

<p>A definite must have from the winter 2017 Technic lineup.</p>

"canbayram","2018-02-07T14:38:37.88Z","Earns 5 Star for Me","<p>I got this set in Jan 2018 with a discount of 40%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability is great for both kids and adults.&nbsp;</p>

<p>4 wheel steering is the most exciting point of the whole model for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All other features are almost as genuine as the steering.&nbsp;They are:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Extension of the boom with the new gear-rack part&nbsp;which is driven by the also new 1L worm screw.</p>

<p>Rotation of the boom with a small linear actuator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rotation of the scoop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So four great functions to play with gets 5 star playability for this model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You may modify the model to become a forklift truck with a few changes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, kind of reasonable price Technic 40 year set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of 40th&nbsp;Anniversary, this is one of the three models that combine into the legendary Technic Car. I also have the other two sets and thinking of building the anniversary model&nbsp;as well.&nbsp;</p>

"Lochdent","2017-04-25T08:08:21.387Z","What Technic is all about","<p>As soon as I saw the preview of this set online I knew I wanted it. I waited until it was available in shops and when I finally got it, was not disappointed.</p>

<p>It took over an hour to build at a leisurely pace and was a good experience even if I got a bit lost and had to retrace my steps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing AFOLs are going to love is that there are virtually no stickers (5 in all) and they only add minor decoration and don&#39;t &quot;make&quot; the set. I don&#39;t know about what pieces are new or rare but it the tyres seem pretty cool and different to me as well as a few other gear and actuator type pieces.</p>

<p>All the fuctions are really slick and it does pretty much everything you could ask of it. It features 4-wheel-steering by way of levers not gears and racks and it is a very smooth, quick action. Raising and lowering of the boom is by way of an interesting piece (unsure if it is new) which telescopes when the axle protruding from the bottom is turned. It very effectively simulates a hydraulic ram and is&nbsp;driven by a knob on the side. The boom is then able to be extended by a worm drive on a rack and the bucket can be tilted by a small knob at the end of the boom so all funtions are mechanically driven.</p>

<p>This is a great set, it represents what I believe Technic is all about; construction and commercial vehicles with lots of functions. My only complaint is that I think at $50AUD it is about 10-20% too expensive given its piece count and size, having said that I haven&#39;t been this happy with a lego set in a while (not that I have been disappointed, this one is just that good). The telehandler does everything one could realistically want ot to,&nbsp;all gearing is excellent for play and it looks very cool on the shelf.&nbsp;This is an absolute must-have for Technic fans young and old.</p>
