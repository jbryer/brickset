You know, things like &quot;can you find me a piece that is two on one side, three on the other, and is blue?&quot;, then just show her where to put them. Well, halfway through the build, she starts getting ahead of me. For the rest of the build, I just let her follow the template - I have never been so proud. As I write this, she it taking it apart with a brick separator, and sorting by piece, so that she can build it again.</p>

<p>Bottom line, this was a fantastic first set, and should be pretty easy to recreate without the official set just with parts from most random collections. I&#39;d love to see more sets like this one.</p>

Pretty hard to find it now, but thankfully it isn&#39;t hard to build. (Use the template).</p>
