<p>The pieces are nice and the single builds are cool. But the fact that I only can display one model at the time killed the experience for me. Unfortunatly.</p>

You can&#39;t even build all the models in either of the books without dismantling earlier models which rather defeats the purpose of a set like this to encourage creativity.</p>

<p>Now have two choices, throw all the parts in my stock or add to the set so you can build them all for next christmas. Given the experience and usual creativity of Lego they have let themselves down and need to do better next time.</p>

"HarleyMeenen","2018-02-04T22:02:51.067Z","A Lot of Work for Little Payout","<p>To be blunt, this set is far from my favorite. I will admit that a lot of this comes down to personal preference. I like to dedicate myself to a build and have something to show for it, leave it out for a while, take it apart and bring it back out at a later time to do it all again. This set is not conducive to any of that.</p>

<p>The point of this set is to countdown to Christmas, with a different build each day. I love the concept, especially given how much I love Christmas. However, the process turned out to be less than satisfying. For one, each build has to be taken apart to move onto the next. Of course, doing otherwise would hugely inflate the piece count and likely eliminate this set as a good free add on. Nevertheless, it doesn&#39;t give you much time to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Not to mention, that much dismantling does a number on your fingers- ow!</p>

<p>Additionally, I wasn&#39;t all that pleased with the builds themselves. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, it&#39;s impressive how much detail can be put into such a small model. But the small scale and the redundancy of pieces renders makes it almost impossible to tell what some of the builds are supposed to be, and several seem quite similar.</p>

<p>I recognize that the design factor of this set is admirable. Unfortunately, the build process boils down to a lot of uninteresting building of mediocre models, only to immediately tear them apart and start again.</p>

"Legonary","2017-09-08T14:08:49.497Z","For a free set it's great","<p>The parts are in a cool box that you can close. I&nbsp;like the idea that you can build a model every day.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p>The models look cool and are fast build. But it&#39;s a bit frustrating that you have to take apart the model after one day.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The selection of parts is good, but unfortunately&nbsp;you can&#39;t build all models at the same time. But sometimes you can build 2 or 3 models at the same time.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Because it&#39;s like an advent calendar you can build 24 models. This means you have 24 days of building fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for money</strong></p>

<p>For a free model it has quite a lot of parts. And if you have this model you don&#39;t need to buy another advent calendar.</p>

<p><strong>Overall rating</strong></p>

<p>The idea to have a creator advent calendar is great. And for a free model it&#39;s okay, that you don&#39;t have the parts to build all the models at the same time. I look forward to the <a href=""http://brickset.com/article/30377/40253-xmas-build-up-revealed!"">new free advent calendar</a>.</p>
