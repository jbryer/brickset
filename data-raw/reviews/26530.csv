<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>A thick rectangular box, similar to the Hulkbuster Smash set houses the kit. Iron Man is the figure of choice on the top with a scene of Justin Hammer fleeing from Phil Coulson and Tony Stark next to him.<br />
The front of the box shows the characters in a battle situation over the city. The back shows more of the battle with 6 panels showing the play features.<br />
There are two small rectangular instruction manuals inside. Book 1 is for Lola and Book 2 is for the mech. There is also a comic book adventure included as well.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The price per piece ratio is average for a kit this size. A nice variety of colours and a joy to have the good old-fashioned red bricks represented in lots of pieces for Lola, adding some new parts to my collection.<br />
There are 3 bags in the box.&nbsp;<br />
Bag 1 contains parts for the Lola and Phil Coulson.<br />
Bag 2 contains parts for the upper body and arms of the Detroit Steel mech and Justin Hammer.<br />
Bag 3 contains the parts for legs and weapons of the Detroit Steel mech and Iron Man.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>The set comes with three currently exclusive minifigures.<br />
Firstly we have Iron Man. The detailing across the torso and legs is the usual superb standard. This time, his armour is a brighter read. Tony has his standard smiling / angry face head and has a black hair piece for when he&#39;s not got his helmet on. The new helmet is something of a let down. The original opening face design was far superior to this. He comes equipped with the standard set of repulsar effects for his hands and feet and the new power blasts for his hands. These work very easily and add play value for kids.<br />
Next up we have our first figure of Tony&#39;s business rival Justin Hammer, decked out in the Detroit Steel suit. The stars and stripes printing across his armour is excellent and very colourful. He has serious and smiling faces printed on his head piece and the detailing on his glasses by misting the lenses ever so slightly is a great touch. He comes with a brown hair piece for when he&#39;s not wearing his helmet, which sadly, like Iron Man&#39;s is the new non-opening design.<br />
Finally we get to my favourite, Phil Coulson. All I can say is that it&#39;s about time he made it to minifigure form. Phil really should&#39;ve been part of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier set and fans were disappointed when he failed to appear but he&#39;s here at last. His head features a smiling face complete with bluetooth device on one side and the more serious face with sunglasses on the other. The lenses on his glasses are reflective which is really nice. His torso is well detailed, right down to his ID badge. He comes armed with a double barreled gun.</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Total building time, 20 minutes.<br />
The Detroit Steel mech is a good, solid and highly poseable toy. The construction is somewhat reminiscent of the Exo-Force mechs from 2007. The designed has packed lots of small details into the mech and the use of ball joints and hinge joints are exploited for as much movement as possible.<br />
There are 5 stickers to apply. One sits on the chest, one on each thigh and one on each wrist.<br />
Lola is a great looking car. Driveable, solid and very playable, again the designer took care to replicate the look of the vehicle and make that in Lego form. The mechanism for drive - flight mode is nicely done and works fluidly without being too loose.<br />
There are 5 stickers to apply One is for the control display and the remaining four are details for inside the wheel arches showing the repulsar tech when Lola is in flight mode. Strangely enough, the front grill and license plate are a printed piece.</p>

<p>The completed models</p>

<p>The Detroit Steel mech is quite a nice piece. You can see kids pitting this against the Hulkbuster armour. The mech has lots of poseability and moving parts. The front folds open so you can put Justin Hammer, or any other figure, inside. The three fingered hands open and close so they can grip figures or vehicles. It comes armed with two weapons, a saw blade and a 6 shot stud shooter. Both of these are removable so they don&#39;t have to be on the mech if not desired. The saw blade is a simple rotating cog affair but conveys the idea. The stud shooter add playability for kids and comes with 12 orange disc blasts.<br />
The mech stands 18.5 cm tall, 11 cm wide and 5 cm deep.<br />
Lola is gorgeous. The construction is very solid and she looks great. Unfortunately, the interior only seats one figure but that&#39;s a minor issue. Inside there are the controls on a moveable display, steering wheel and two control levers for engaging the flight mode. There are opening doors on each side. Flight mode is achieved by rotating the exhausts upwards, which moves the wheels downwards and exposing the repulsar tech decals inside.<br />
Lola measures 14.5 cm long, 6 cm wide and 4 cm tall.</p>

<p>Overall opinion</p>

<p>This is a great kit and definitely the front runner for Marvel sets released so far this year. For me, the inclusion of Phil Coulson and Lola made this a must have purchase. While the mech adds play value for kids, it&#39;s really the agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. that I wanted it for. Hopefully this may pave the way for sets from Agents Of S.H.I.E.L.D. to be released in the future.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2017-05-25T00:42:32.607Z","Average Set Only a Step Away from Greatness","<p><em>Iron Man: Detroit Steel&nbsp;</em>strikes was one of the strange yet unique releases from the Winter wave of Marvel Superhero sets in the beginning of 2017. Despite its stand out features, one very famous character&#39;s first release in Lego with his flying car, and a mech in a flashy color scheme; it is hard to deny this is a remake of the 2015 Hulkbuster set... So does this set improve on its clear predecessor?&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><em>Iron Man</em>: A character we have gotten multiple times before in Lego, this Iron Man figure sets itself apart with the new helmet mold and bright red plastic molding to make it look like the All New All Different Iron Man variant seen in the comics. The head is the same Tony Stark head used in previous sets, but it includes black hair for the figure to use when not using the helmet. I am glad the hair is included and wish other Iron Man figures had also included it, since being able to display him helmet-less is always a fun alternative option. The new blaster pieces are cool looking, but I have only tested them a few times and been disapointed by their short flight.</p>

<p><em>Justin Hammer:&nbsp;</em>A bit of a stranger character in this set. In the comics Justin Hammer is an older industrialist, but the young face and hair used here seems to be based on Sam Rockwell&#39;s portrayal of the character in the film <em>Iron Man 2</em>. I believe his head is a print previously used in the Big Bang Theory&nbsp;set.While from the neck up the character is similar to the MCU version, from the neck down he is something different; taking on the armor of Detroit Steel from the comics. It has been mentioned ad-nauseum that Hammer has never really been associated with Detroit Steel (although I think his daughter in the comics once wore the armor?)... so this mismatch seems strange. Had Lego wished for us to have the film version of the character it would have made sense to include a dress suit for him in the set rather than his star spangled battle armor.</p>

<p><i>Agent/Director Phil Coulson:&nbsp;</i>Lets be honest, this character was long overdue in Lego and finally getting him in this set definitely brings up the minifigure&nbsp;value. Having been introduced in the original 2008 <em>Iron Man</em> film played by Clark Gregg, the character has been retroactively included in comics and cartoon projects. Currently Clark Gregg is playing the character on TV in <em>Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</em> The figure though doesn&#39;t fully capture Clark Gregg, particularly with the hair piece used. However the figure does accurately depict the video game model used in <em>Lego Marvel Superheroes </em>and <em>Lego Marvel Avengers</em>. Perhaps this is some secret confirmation that Lego is using the video games to tease future character designs... or at the very least willing to modify the TT produced game models into actual finished Lego set form... Considering Lego&#39;s official Ms. Marvel also resembles her video game counterpart, perhaps we can hope for some more &quot;game only&quot; characters to move into real Lego brick form... Anyways back to the Coulson figure, his double sided face is particularly interesting; my favorite side being his stern face with Men In Black style sunglasses.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The first part of the assembly is Coulson&#39;s car from <em>Agents</em>; Lola. The build is simple and probably will be familiar to anyone who has built any of Lego&#39;s previous &quot;flying cars&quot; with a dash of the current Speed Champions line thrown in there too. Not the most engaging build, but fun none the less.</p>

<p>The final build is the large Detroit Steel mech. This is where the blatant plagiarism of the 2015 Hulkbuster becomes apparent. The frame, the arms, and a myriad of other details are tweaked versions of what the Hulkbuster did two years before. The Detroit Steel mech has a striking color scheme further enhanced by stickers; but even when built I can&#39;t shake the impression this is just &quot;Hulkbuster 2.0.&quot; I haven&#39;t had such a strong case of builder&#39;s deja-vu since when I last built one of the original Bionicle Toa &quot;clone waves&quot; back in the day.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Final Model</strong></p>

<p>Lola is far from perfect, but a decent representation of a classic &#39;Vette&nbsp;with the nice flying car function incorporated. The end though is hardly photogenic, and could have been enhanced with the inclusion of a license plate to the back. Unfortunately a far more interesting model of Lola was shown digitally in the <em>Lego Marvel Avengers</em> video game, and considering Coulson&#39;s&nbsp;faithful look to the game it is interesting Lola was rather simplified in actual Lego form. Despite those criticisms, I feel the model still does a passable job with the set&#39;s price point and piece limits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Detroit Steel is a fun model, but looks glaringly incomplete without a pilot at the helm, and a little goofy with the small helmeted pilot once he is strapped in. The two &quot;weapons&quot; are rather bland, the stud shooter cannon makes sense but the &quot;saw&quot; represented by two gears on a Technic beam are rather dull. The striking dark blue and red scheme elevates the figure though and it looks nice enough to make it worth adding to the Superhero collection. Then there are the feet that look like stilettos with rockets strapped to them.. a strange design choice indeed.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>If this set suffers from anything it is its strange lack of definition. Is this meant to be a semi-MCU tribute set, with three characters from the Iron Man films? If so why not include a movie accurate Iron Man with a previously unreleased armor and a large mech of either Whiplash or Iron Monger from the films? Or is it meant to be a comic set, with ANAD Iron Man facing off against a comics inspired villain? If so why is the villain under the mask so distinctly Sam Rockwell&#39;s film version of the character? Or is this meant as some sort of glorified Coulson&nbsp;delivery&nbsp;package? If so why not cut out Iron Man and Hammer, and give us a few S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to go&nbsp;against one of their foes from the TV show? This makes it hard to define what this set was meant to be. For a collector of previous Marvel sets, it offers characters whose worth is probably gained by posing them with figures from the previous sets; Coulson with the Avengers, a new Iron Man suit for the Hall of Armor, and a new villain to throw into the mix. However for those who are a first time Lego&nbsp;Marvel buyer, this is a strange mishmash of influences that has more akin to a &quot;sample platter&quot; appetizer than the actual &quot;main course&quot; of a meal.</p>

<p>Despite those flaws, this set has found a place in my collection. For all my complaints the mech is similar to the Hulkbuster; that is also its greatest strength. For those with the 2015 set, this new mech is a true rival. It is great to display the Hulkbuster&nbsp;fighting the Detroit Steel mech, two robotic machines duking it out with one another. The fins on the back of Detroit Steel can be even moved a bit to allow a space for the Hulk figure to grasp onto its back, aiding Tony in the fight... However this is also the main problem of this set, it feels like an accessory to complete a set released two years earlier. For those of us who own both sets, this isn&#39;t an issue; as we can enjoy the fun of the dueling mechs... But for those who missed out on the original Hulkbuster this feels like a strange imitation of something that was far more interesting and relevant to the source material.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In short, for a Lego fan interested in <em>Agents</em>, or the <em>ANAD Iron Man</em> comic run; then this set will be worth the purchase. For the Lego fan with the Hulkbuster looking for some sort of Rock-Em-Sock-Em Marvel mech battle, this is a great companion to that 2015 set. But for those interested in none of those factors, be forewarned this set is far from perfect although it shows it had the possibility to be so much more.</p>
