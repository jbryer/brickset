"andyh1984","2017-02-09T18:05:44.26Z","Could have been better","<p>I will start by saying that I only bought this set because it had a third off rrp as apart from the Minifigures I didn&#39;t think it warranted the price tag. I primarily buy Lego for the building experience not just for Minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The jet is simple to build and the device for altering the wings is good but there is no wow factor in this build</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The Kamala Khan Minifigure is really nice and some would say this fig justifies the price of the set on it&#39;s own, the long arm piece works well and is quite poseable and comes with large hands that clip onto the regular hands that are attached to the arm piece.</p>

<p>Super adaptoid is good but has a plain grey head piece and the new one-piece Iron Man helmet which I personally dislike.</p>

<p>Captain America looks nice in his bomber jacket and goggles and a clip has been added to the jet so his shield becomes his backrest when in the cockpit, this is something I find annoying in sets where there is no accessory storage so is a big plus in my opinion.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>I still think it is overpriced and relying on the Minifigures not the Lego build to sell this set which seems to be getting more noticeable in licensed sets, but it is an okay set if you find it at a reduced price.</p>

<p>I picked this set up truly for the unique minifigures that come with the set. The minifigures all have interesting printing and are fun to play with. I am a fan of the fact that they do not each have multiple hair/head pieces. I think this detracts from the playability as opposed to adding. The plane is an added bonus and would rather by a full set, than just buy the minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: Captain America Pilot looks nice with the goggles on his head, and warm jet fighter jacket. &nbsp;Ms. Marvel is a great figure to play with and the arms are very playable as you can slide them to make one arm longer. The added hands to make them big is another feature I enjoy. Super Adaptoid&nbsp;is a good figure because it adds the appeal of Iron Man, and gives us another chance to get Falcon&#39;s wings. The &#39;Power Blasts&#39; that come with the set are very fun. They fire well and look nice. They are a great addition to any piece collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: Although the plane is simple, it does come with adjustable wings and plates that can shoot out of the wings. My favorite part is the rear upright wings and exhaust engines. They look very nice and the stickers add to the look. This could be a bit bigger, but for the cost you really are getting a great set.There are over 8 stickers, which seems like a lot for such a small set. The wings are a little flimsy since they are only connected at one point, but can adjust forwards/backwards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros: Great minifigures, good price, high playability, unique pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons: simple plane design, a lot of stickers for small set.</p>

<p>Overall I would recommend this set for anyone because the plane would be fun for anyone to play with, while the minifigures are great to collect. Also for the price you really get a great deal. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cheers.</p>
