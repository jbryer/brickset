I got this as a Christmas eve gift and I really enjoyed it.The gold string and the 2x2 white&nbsp;tile on the back with the 2016 print are nice editions to any one&#39;s collection. The arms can only move sideways and there is no movement&nbsp;in&nbsp;the legs. I liked the&nbsp;choice for the mustache piece, it is a useful&nbsp;piece that I pesonaly don&#39;t see too often. You can recognize what this is and it it looks great for its size. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a nice, little holiday LEGO&reg; display item that you can enjoy on your Christmas&nbsp;tree or on a shelf.</p>
