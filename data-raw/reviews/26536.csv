"Lego_fan_","2019-01-12T00:48:01.647Z","Another well thought out show.","<p>This is another one of Lego&#39;s well thought out shows that takes place in the star wars universe. It falls into place between episode 5 and 6 and lines up great. It is some much fun that when I had a whole summer to kill (because I did not have access to my Lego collection because of an Insurance mess) I watched it all day long every day until I got a new set. which was not for three weeks. I liked it so much that I needed it for Christmas. I don&#39;t want to spoil this great show to anyone who has not seen it but All I will say is you need to see it. Any Lego Star Wars fans need to seeit.</p>

This partnership lasted for two seasons and seems to be the final animated LEGO Star Wars adventures which have been made at this time.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Presentation</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This season had 13 episodes, and the packaging is very impressive. The original packaging was more involved, as there were free items included with the release. I received my copy from Disney Movie Rewards, which unfortunately while being free, did not include the free magnets or whatever else was meant to come with the season.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The packaging is still very impressive, you see the main characters with the images of Darth Vader and Palpatine menacing in the background. A very nice idea and highly reminiscent of the posters of the live-action films.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Nothing was included with this unfortunately, as I noted above. Originally I believe it was meant to include some kind of printed magnets with pictures of the characters, but nothing came with my copy.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Contents</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Two discs are included, this is the Blu-Ray release, you have 1-7 on one disc and 8-13 on the other. All of the episodes are just as fun and entertaining as I remember them from when I watched them on T-V. The volume is a bit low though when watching them, I seem to remember them being much louder and more epic when originally broadcast. Perhaps my sound system isn&rsquo;t up to snuff for these Blu-Rays. There&rsquo;s a few short bonus features discussing behind the scenes of the show, but not much else, no digital games to play or anything like that. It&rsquo;s a solid season of enjoyable content though loaded with awesome fun that only LEGO can deliver.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I enjoyed Freemaker Adventures when I first saw it, I still have yet to see Season Two, but I&rsquo;d still recommend picking this up. It&rsquo;s fun to watch again and again whenever you&rsquo;d want and it&rsquo;s nice to see new characters in Star Wars interacting with some of the classic agents of the Empire and heroes of the Rebellion. If you can get it for free with Disney Movie Reward points it&rsquo;s even better. I&rsquo;m hoping Season Two becomes available soon, but if not, well I&rsquo;ll just buy it finally to watch. Recommended.</p>
