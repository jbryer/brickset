"TinCanBassMan","2016-12-04T05:30:22.283Z","A very fun little set","<p>I bought&nbsp;this set with my son today after he picked it out of a number of options on the shelf. &nbsp;He loves the Lego police and&nbsp;said he wanted something with handcuffs.</p>

<p>For me, the little ATM is the highlight of the set and I found it&nbsp;very pleasing in both design and simplicity. &nbsp;Not visible in the accompanying stock photo is the small&nbsp;Technic-style pin connected through the rear&nbsp;that you&nbsp;can push to knock the safe/computer portion of the unit off its&nbsp;base&nbsp;and&nbsp;allow the villains to grab the loot. &nbsp;A&nbsp;great little action feature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vehicle seems like a bit of an afterthought and is fairly basic in design. &nbsp;Nevertheless, it&#39;ll hold both police minifigs and the minidog&nbsp;which is handy for chasing down the baddies. &nbsp;And besides,&nbsp;another set of wheels is always welcome on the Lego police force.</p>

<p>You get a nice collection of minifigs for such a small set along with&nbsp;a jackhammer, dynamite, walkie-talkie,&nbsp;3 money tiles (including the one mounted above the ATM)&nbsp;and 2 sets of handcuffs. &nbsp;All the elements built quickly and&nbsp;easily which is exactly what you&nbsp;expect for a small set like this. &nbsp;Nothing really remarkable about the parts but, once again, that&#39;s to be expected.</p>

<p>My little guy immediately got to playing with this set and found it goes great with&nbsp;the&nbsp;60128: Police Pursuit set he already had. &nbsp;This is a fun little set with lots of play value that was easy-enough on the wallet at $12.99 CDN (although the lower $8.99 price point might be a little more realistic given it&#39;s&nbsp;basic nature). &nbsp;In any case, it&#39;s&nbsp;a&nbsp;welcome addition to our collection.</p>

<p><strong><em>Packaging and Parts:</em></strong></p>

<p>We get a nice little graphic on the cover of the box depicting the antagonists trying to rob an ATM. Our local police, however, &nbsp;appear to have a distinct advantage over our crooks though. Inside we get two bags and thankfully no stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em><strong>Minifigures:</strong></em></p>

<p>Included in this set are four minifigures. We get two police officers and two crooks. The best part is we get an even gender spread one male and one female for each faction. They come with front and back printing on their torsos and the detailing looks great! Plus we get a police dog, or is it the crooks&#39; dog? You can decide I suppose =)</p>

<p><em><strong>The Build and Completed Set:</strong></em></p>

<p>The build will not be taxing by any stretch. No stickers means it will be done really quickly. We get an ATM for our crooks to rob and a small ATV or UTV type vehicle for the police. Needless to say our crooks have no chance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Overall:</em></strong></p>

<p>If you or your young builder is a fan of cops and robbers than this set will surely please you. The builds are simple but it is a cheap way to add an ATM to a city scene and to bolster your cops and robbers population for a cheap price.&nbsp;</p>

"BlueGalaxy47","2017-05-29T19:01:15.227Z","Nice build","<p>This is a cool set as both the ATM and the police truck look really cool. I like the play feature for the ATM and I really like how you can fit all of the Minifigure police officers including the dog onto the truck as well. It is a very clever build and I like it a lot.&nbsp;<br />
To make this set, even better, they could build up the truck a little bit more.</p>
