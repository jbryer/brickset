<h3>Box / Instructions</h3>

<p>Nothing remarkable here. &nbsp;the box is a box and the instructions are clear as usual. &nbsp;My 5-year old has rebuilt the tow truck solo&nbsp;three times. &nbsp;Not bragging - just saying the instructions are well-written :)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Again, nothing really remarkable as you&#39;d expect although I did find some of the usage of pieces in the tow truck build was clever.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>A simple, quick build you&#39;d expect for a small set like this. &nbsp;There are 6-7 stickers that are relatively easy to apply. &nbsp;Had the whole thing ready to go in about 15 minutes.</p>

<h3>Completed Model</h3>

<p>The highlight is definitely the tow truck. &nbsp;The sporty profile was a pleasant surprise and it holds up well to play. &nbsp;Colouring is nice and this is a case where the stickers set off the visual appeal nicely.</p>

<p>The police bike with the race-style cowling looks nice once its all stickered up although the lack of a kickstand makes it tricky to balance. &nbsp;I also thought it would benefit from smooth tires vs. treaded tires but no matter - it&#39;s just a small part of the set.</p>

<p>The safe is a neat little model that features a red jewel along with three money tiles and the dirt bike model is common to many sets throughout the Lego universe. &nbsp;There&#39;s a nice assortment of minifigs and accessories.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>A fun set and a welcome addition to our&nbsp;Lego police collection.</p>

"BlueGalaxy47","2017-05-29T19:04:31.59Z","Fun Set","<p>This is an extremely fun set as it has an extremely fun story which kids will love. A tow truck that should be used to tow vehicles is towing a safe away from a bank! It is quite a funny set and the plot is funny as well. I also like the look of the truck a lot but not so much the police chief bike, but however, I like the police off road bike very much.</p>

<p>It is a shame that the police off road bike can&#39;t stay upright on Lego Studs and baseplates.</p>

<p>It is also very nice to see that the tow truck can also be used to tow other vehicles as well, not just safes from banks!</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the instructions are not great when you come to build the safe.</p>

<p>Overall, this is an extremely fun set that kids will absolutely love playing with.</p>

"Faefrost","2019-01-22T05:31:12.557Z","A great little City Tow Truck. With Some Cops and a Safe along for the ride","<p>A charming little City set that sits just a hair above the impulse buy set pricing, but under the $20 Great Vehicles. This set is a happy little surprise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions - The Box is a little large for the sets contents. At 144 parts there isn&#39;t a lot in it but air. The front is a nice dynamic action picture of the crook using a tow truck to haul away a bank safe while two police give chase. One on a Superbike&nbsp;the other on an off road dirt bike. The story is well communicated in that single picture and lays out the play patern. The instructions are a thin folded and most likely mangled little booklet. Plus an equally mangled sticker sheet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs&nbsp;- You get three figures, which is great for the price. 2 Police officers and one bad guy. You have a Lady Motorcycle/Highway officer who rides a big fully cowled touring bike. She has a dark blue uniform. A more street or desk dressed older mustached officer riding a more off road bike. And a crook dressed in a mechanics safety vest, with just a hint of his striped shirt underneath. He has a lot of personality. The two cops each have white motorcycle helmets. The crook has a wool cap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts - Not a huge number of pieces, but some useful ones. The plain black 5 sided shield is nice. There is a nice assortment of minifig accesories including a gold crowbar, 2 different motorcycles, walkie talkie, handcuffs, etc. Lots of 100 dollar bills, 2 gems, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build/Model - You have two mostly preformed motorcycles. Nothing exciting. And a cute little modern style tow truck. The Tow Truck is everything we could want and is the star of the set. Nicely shaped it looks to be the perfect compliment to the one included in the D2C Corner Garage Modular Building. With the more modern hydraulic beam lift arm. Full amber light bar across the top and more modern shaped hood. There is also a roughly minifig&nbsp;sized Bank Safe that has clearly been hauled out of a bank or store in its entirety by the crook using the tow truck. It has a second smaller sub safe inside which holds the money. The crook has a cutting torch to attempt to open it at his leisure once he escapes pursuit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this set is great fun and Great value. It has some perfect play features. And just enough to keep a kid entertained for ages, while at the same time offering details that would fit right into an AFOL&#39;s City or Modular display. It pairs exceptionally well with either the Brick Bank or the Corner Garage. It&#39;s basic. But its the best kind of basic.&nbsp;</p>
