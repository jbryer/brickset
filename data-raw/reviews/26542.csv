"WarpyTrauma","2020-02-12T07:33:52.967Z","Simple and effective ","<p>My 4 year old has just finished completing this set, he&rsquo;s been Bricking for a couple of months and this set didn&rsquo;t trouble him much at all. Other than sticker application he didn&rsquo;t require much help. We had fun making it, he&rsquo;s into cars and trucks so it held his attention throughout. We completed it in 3 sittings, the set has 4 bags.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set is pretty fun for him, he&rsquo;s putting it through it&rsquo;s paces now and everything is holding up well.&nbsp;I&rsquo;d have&nbsp;liked the truck&nbsp;trailer to have some more detail. It seems very spartan, especially with the compartments closed, I&rsquo;d settle for stickers or hooks, just to break up the whiteness. That said, we have lots of City Arctic sets in the house so a lot of these white bricks will be useful for snow scenes, there&rsquo;s some very useful bricks in here. I&rsquo;d recommend this set for a 4 or 5 year old who&rsquo;s familiar with Lego, it should not be too hard, the rest is up to their imagination. Happy building&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building the truck and trailer were really fun to do. All the instructions are clear and the truck itself is very solid and beautiful to see. The roof is a minor thing, it has no grip so falls off very easily.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trailer,&nbsp;on the other hand, is big and not as sophisticated as the truck. Like it&#39;s been designed by someone else. In addition, the construction is really bad. If you place the trailer on the truck you can see it bends.</p>
