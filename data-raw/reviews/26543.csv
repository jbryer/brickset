<p><strong>Box / Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box is pretty standard City fare, so doesn&#39;t really need to be spoken about. &nbsp;There are 4 small booklets and one medium booklet. Each vehicle has a small booklet, then the ground floor of bank has a small booklet, and top floor plus roof has the slightly larger booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As expected, all the instructions are pretty easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>With this set you get a number of tan brown columns, which will only ever really be any good for buildings, as well as windows galore. Probably the pieces that stand out the most are the tracks for the bulldozer, which I will get to shortly. I think the most disappointing part for me was the drainpipe, which I will come back to as well.</p>

<p>The sticker sheet is not too onerous, and provides important detailing to each element of the set. At least there are none of those horrid window stickers, which probably means the floor to ceiling windows in the bank don&#39;t meet safety requirements, but I&#39;m OK with that.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>5 Minifigures plus Zorro the ubiquitous German Shepherd.</p>

<p>First up, the crooks. They both have the standard black beanie. One is wearing red overall over a white shirt. His legs are printed with grubbiness, but it&#39;s pretty subtle, and that&#39;s the only leg printing in this set. His patner in crime has a ginger beard and is wearing a dark green track suit or similar. He&#39;s wearing grey gloves so he&#39;s clearly all prepped for burglarizing the bank.</p>

<p>The cops. We have a female chopper pilot wearing light blue shades (very styley) and a dark blue flight suit; and a female truck driver with cool forage-cap-with-brown-hair-underneath, and sweet aviator shades. She&#39;s wearing a light blue uniform top with radio printed on, and dark blue legs. This minifigure is identical to the pursuit driver in 60141 Police Station. The remaining cop is a male dog handler wearing dark blue uniform and grey tactical vest, and a blue baseball cap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigure that is missing is a bank worker. I know this set is about the break in, which would only really happen at night when the bank is closed, but I still wish they&#39;d put in a banker to increase the play value. I honestly wouldn&#39;t have minded if they swapped out the dog and handler for a banker, but they didn&#39;t. The business woman from my Fun in the Park set has been co-opted in to be a banker for play value.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing too onerous about the build, but there are some fun elements.</p>

<p>The bulldozer is pretty cool. I love the tracks, they seem really authentic and look awesome. The technic connections to connect the plough is possibly a bit fiddly for small fingers but my kids haven&#39;t built this one yet so can&#39;t really say for sure. I would like a better way of hooking the hook onto the dozer, or somewhere to let the second crook hang on for the getaway, but those are minor issues really.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The chopper has quite a different tail to what I&#39;m used to, and it looks cool with the housed fan on the end of the technic stuff. I also like the giant searchlight and the camera. I&#39;ve also swapped out the white lens with the red spare from the main build, to turn it into a Forward Looking Infra Red camera, but that&#39;s just me geeking out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The truck is the highlight of this set for me. It&#39;s big, it&#39;s rugged,&nbsp;it looks authentic, and it just looks mean. I love the bars on the outside, and it has doubled up as my Armed Offenders Squad (what others might call a SWAT team, I guess) response van on a number of occasions. It&#39;s got a nice big cage at the back so it&#39;s great for prisoner transport and can also double up as a dog van, although the handler either has to share with the dog or hang onto the side.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bank looks pretty good too, I like the colour scheme of green and tan brown, and the use of columns and big windows look neat. It&#39;s got a security camera over the front door, and a warning light out the front too. There is an area for the teller (but no teller) with a computer and coffee, and access to the back of the atm. The play features include the atm which can be pulled off by the chain (or a strong minifgure with a crow bar), and the vault upstairs can also be yanked off with the chain. There&#39;s a trap door on the roof to allow access to the vault as well, just be careful not to set off the burglar alarm! The most disappointing part for me is the drainpipe running down the side near the vault. The idea is for the crook to shimmy down or up and hook the chain to the vault, &nbsp;but the pipe is made of pretty flimsy plastic, and the first (and only) time my guy grabbed the pipe, he pretty much crushed it in his little lego hand, and damaged it quite visibly. So now it&#39;s just for decoration and doesn&#39;t really add anything to our playing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>Dodgy drainpipes and missing tellers aside, once this one is completed it&nbsp;is a fantastic set and although it contains the fairly standard cops and robbers of the city set, it has a great public building which every city needs, as well as some pretty funky vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>I was given this one as a birthday present (I have a great wife who supports my Lego addiction), but I&#39;m pretty sure she got it on sale and it was a pretty good value for money. If you can likewise find it on sale, or even if you can&#39;t, &nbsp;I&#39;d say this is a must have for anyone trying to build their own Brickton.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
