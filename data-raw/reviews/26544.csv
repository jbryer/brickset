It is built sturdy and the car that comes with it easily can drive up the ramps and connects so it will stay attached as you drive the truck. You can also transport another small car on the bottom layer which adds to the playability of the truck.</p>

<p>It is a little pricey for just a couple vehicles&nbsp;but according to the 403 pcs it is not too far off from past LEGO price points. I would recommend it if you enjoy the police sets.</p>
