<p>There&#39;s nothing overly unique about the parts included, and while I normally hate stickers, the way they&#39;re used on this kit, especially the unification of the spoiler, top of the engine, and the top of the rollbar, is quite well done.</p>

<p>As far as playability, my kids keep swiping it off my shelf to play with, even ignoring larger Star Wars kits in the process.</p>

"Japanbuilder","2017-05-05T05:57:20.667Z","Four wheels of off-road fun!","<p>Usually every year we get these small city sets for cars and other vehicles in specialized settings. I believe last year we got a rally car and a race boat. This year we get an off-road buggy which looks very attractive but how does it hold up? Let&#39;s read on!</p>

<p><strong>Packaging and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The front and back of the box reveal a very fun set of scenes for our buggy and I must say the colors are initially what drew me to the set. I love the red and white on the vehicle and the design looks promising.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside we find a couple of bags, a manual and a loose under-carriage piece. We also get a large amount of stickers for a set of this size but thankfully they&#39;re not too bad to apply. Though I would recommend getting some model kit pincers to make that process easier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sadly, we will not get too many things by way of spare parts but the pieces we do get are very nice. We get 3 engine exhaust pieces in silver 5 printed 1x1 round tile pieces with the LIGHT logo on them and a fin piece with a bar connector. My favorite piece though is the all clear visor piece. Usually in city we get these with slight tint of black or brown which looks nice but on occasion a plainer color is welcome so I was happy to get two of them in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>We get one minifigure in this set and he looks great. His face is slightly soiled from all the dirt getting under his helmet and he has a confident grin on his face. The print on the torso is great and clashes nicely with the buggy&#39;s color scheme. Plus he looks the part so definitely worth adding to your collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build and Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>The building experience was very enjoyable, probably due to anticipating having the vehicle shown-off in the box art. Still it was fun and I actually learned a trick or two about detailing on these much simpler builds, which is always rewarding.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model is amazing. We get a red and white color scheme with black for a trim and axle colors. The shaping in particular looks like a real off-road buggy and certainly something that is made to withstand tumbles. The entire thing is great to look at on display and the huge tires also make it fun to play with. If I were a kid I would be thrilled with this thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>For such a simple build and for the price it is certainly the most fun out of a box I have had in a while. I was quite pleasantly surprised by both the show-room look of the model and the actual play value of it. Those large exposed wheels with the low chassis make for an excellent racing machine on difficult terrain. The minifigure complements the build well and the colors of the racer are universal enough to blend it in to any other race scene or city scene of your choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I definitely rate this one highly and is probably one of my favorite city sets for this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I bought this set on discount (50%, putting it at the same price as in the US - we don&#39;t get decent prices often here in Colombia!), because I want to start fleshing out my beach scene, and this seemed appropriate, despite the stickers giving it a far more sporty look than I&#39;d initially wanted.</p>

<p>It amazes me how LEGO has improved the quality of their instructions such that this set has a lower recommended limit of 5 years old, yet the finished model is drastically more complicated than anything I could have hoped for from LEGO when I was 5(approximately *cough* 35 years ago *cough*).</p>

<p>The end result is fantastic, and I even caved in and applied the stickers as I felt they added enough to make it worth it.</p>

<p>As far as playability goes, it is a vehicle with no additional play features other than the opening cockpit. Having said that, the large tyres and deliberately smoothed underside means this buggy will handle all but the roughest of surfaces with ease.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Considering the size, there&#39;s a nice selection of new/new-ish pieces such as 6 of the inverted plate with half bow, and also 5 of the printed 1x1 circular plate used for the lights. The 3 engine pieces are nice, although I&#39;m surprised how specific they are - I wish the pipes had been modelled to accept a stud - so they aren&#39;t going to be as much use in MOCs as I&#39;d like.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p>Nothing really to mention, printed torso, plain legs, apart from the facial expression - the lopsided grin is truly lopsided, any more twisted and he&#39;d be able to bite his own eye! I&#39;m happy he&#39;s enjoying himself as the bruising on his cheek indicates he&#39;s taken a bit of a bashing while driving recently!</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Great selection of pieces for such a small set.</li>
	<li>Awesome face on the figure.</li>
	<li>A genuinely great (and different) looking City vehicle.</li>
	<li>Smoothed underside means it&#39;ll handle any &#39;terrain&#39; well.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Despite the stickers adding to the set, there are quite a lot of them (8 to be precise).</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>Much better than hoped for, and I liked the look of it before I bought it!</p>

<p>I will certainly consider picking up some more - they&#39;ll&nbsp;look fantastic in numbers particularly if each has a unique colour&nbsp;scheme (tricky due to stickers, but do-able).</p>

<p>Highly recommended.</p>
