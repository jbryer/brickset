"Duq","2016-12-29T11:07:21.5Z","LEGO City's best looking 4x4","<p><!--StartFragment-->Lego City&#39;s best looking pick-up truck sofar quickly made it onto my Santa list and I was happy to find it under the tree. Looks aren&#39;t everything though...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p><!--EndFragment-->The box shows the contents of the set in a nice off-road setting, nothing unusual there. What seems to be new for 2017 boxes is to show a few minifigure faces in the top right corner, a bit like they&#39;ve done on Star Wars boxes for a long time. The difference is that on the SW boxes it&#39;s usually clear that the face is not a minifig. Here there are three minifigs, and none of them are in the set. In fact, there are only two in the set. I wonder how many customers are going to be confused by this artwork.</p>

<p>The instructions are in two booklets, one of them folded for no apparent reason; it easily fits the box without folding. I&#39;ve said it before: I wish Lego would save some trees and make the instructions a little more challenging. To me 100 pages is excessive for 239 parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>There are two minifigs in this set. Legs and helmets are plain and both faces have been used before. One torso has a dark red shirt under a grey hoodie and has been seen before in 60134 Fun in the park. The other has a grey shirt under a red and white jacket and is new in this set. This design has a waist to make it look female which I don&#39;t like. I&#39;d prefer to have a unisex torso print so I can use face and hair to decide whether to make it a man or a woman.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The 239 parts include 15 wheels! There aren&#39;t many remarkable parts in this set. Some of the more interesting ones are the new shorter wheel arch in dark grey which has only been in a few sets and a red plate hinge which isn&#39;t very common either. The mudguard part on the quads is new in yellow and there are two 2x3 tiles in tan. You also get a few of the 1x2 &#39;upside down bows&#39; in light grey, a very nice part.</p>

<p>There is a sticker sheet with 6 stickers but most are not essential; number plates for the truck, race numbers for the quads, &#39;SPORT&#39; on the roof of the truck and finally a sticker with some detailing for the bonnet. There are two stickers on the side that are used to continue the white stripe. It would have been nice if there was a brick solution for that.</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>If you&#39;ve built City sets before there&#39;s nothing strange here; the car is built mostly layer by layer, with some of the hidden parts in contrasting colours. Bumper and grille of the truck are attached sideways. The quads are identical and very simple to build.</p>

<p>Strangely the tail lights of the truck are 1x2 transparent red plates, while the trailer contains two 1x2 transparent red tiles that are invisible in the finished model. I would recommend swapping them to make the rear of the truck look better.</p>

<h3>The finished model</h3>

<p>The truck is the star of the show here. It&#39;s easy to build and doesn&#39;t contain exotic parts but it&#39;s a clever design. The looks of the truck are spot-on, from the black/white/grey colour scheme to the wide wheel arches and the tan tiles for the wooden planks in the truck bed. The fold-up ramps look good and work well.</p>

<p>That said, I do have some issues. There are gaping holes in the side of the bed to allow for the big wheels and that&#39;s a shame. The doors don&#39;t open and the cab only fits one minifig.</p>

<p>The trailer is a bit simple but functional. I would have liked to see a second axle on the trailer and some tail lights.</p>

<p>The quads are identical and very simple but mostly look the part. I think the mudguards are the wrong way around and they could have done with rear mudguards.</p>

<p>My biggest issue with the set is its size. It&#39;s not as extreme as the Ford F-150 in 75875 but this truck is wide. It&#39;s bigger than the truck in 60151. It starts with the wide tyres on the quads. They force the width of the truck bed.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>This set will be fun to play with. There&#39;s the truck and trailer, both with fold-up ramps for loading the quads. The quads can be raced against eachother. The only problem is the roof of the truck; the overhang above the windscreen looks good but makes the roof a bit fragile; it comes off easily in play.</p>

<h3>Final Verdict</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a truck with impressive/imposing looks in a set with a number of play functions. That makes it a good set for the target audience who probably don&#39;t care about that fact that it&#39;s all a little too big to properly fit in with other City sets.</p>

<p>It has a few small issues but it&#39;s still one of the best City sets this year.</p>

"Keautay","2018-04-20T18:34:12.057Z","If you don't have a million quads already","<p>Overall it&#39;s a good set, but not great. I like the design, particularly the truck&#39;s bed. Price is good!</p>

<p>Building experience and parts<br />
Very basic. The building was predictable and&nbsp;straightforward, but it&#39;s a plus for my 3 year-old daughter, as she can participate and put parts in place. The two quads are identical, save the color.&nbsp;I like the minifigures, especially the fierce looking woman. It adds variety to the collection.</p>

<p>Playability<br />
The playability is good, if you don&#39;t have quads already. I&nbsp;don&#39;t, and that&#39;s why I bought it, so I could have two quads and play with my daughter. She loves the spare tire and the gas canister and spend more time fueling and changing wheels than racing with the quads.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The truck looks nice and the ramps work&nbsp;perfectly. However, it&#39;s very hard to make turns&nbsp;as the wheels are far apart. I hope Lego would come up with wheels that can turn slightly. The roof always comes off, as you have the reflex to grasp the truck near it, and only the two 1x1 studs on the windshield keep it in place. It could have been better.</p>

<p>Conclusion : It&#39;s a good starting set for beginners wanting to play with quads and have accessories to&nbsp;add playability. And the truck looks good.&nbsp;But a few things could have been better...&nbsp;and there are a million sets with quads in it, so maybe you should compare with those before choosing this one.</p>

"Sobel","2019-01-30T09:36:11.09Z","Quad-action for everyone! High playability for a set this size!","<div class=""description"">
<p>To be honest, I am an avid collector of LEGO helicopters. Cars, trucks and means like that never were my focus in collecting. But since the new sets for 2019 do not feature any larger choppers at all and I wanted some new set, I had to choose between the 60207 Drone Chase and this one here. And since this set was on a special discount... well, here we are.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>No special parts, just wheels, axes, windows and all that&#39;s needed for three vehicles. Also includes exchangeable headgear for the minifigs, a spare tire, wrench and gas tank.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Two minifigures are included, a male and a female quad enthusiast. Like mentioned above, you can choose to have them wear helmets or a cap for the guy and hair for the girl (little weird here...).</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As with most cars/trucks, the build is very straightforward, starting with the chassis and finishing with the roof. The quads are built exactly the same, which is fine with me. The built should not take an experienced builder more than 15-20 minutes.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The truck looks sturdy and cool at the same time. The black and gray color scheme fits nicely and is a good contrast to the colorful quads. Both the truck and the trailer have ramps that can be lowered to drive the quads onto them and that also serve as a hold for the quads.<br />
The trailer has enough space for one quad and some gear, which increases the good playability even more!<br />
One thing that I disliked a bit is the rear wheels of the truck. They are open to the loading area of the truck, which makes it look a little cheap.<br />
Along with this comes another flaw: one minifigure does not have a place to be put when all quads are loaded up. One can drive the truck, but the other? I jammed the girl between the quad on the truck and the side of the loading area. Now the shakes a bit when driving, because of the &quot;open&quot; wheel-arch mentioned before.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While being nothing too special to add to an AFOL&#39;s collection, this small set provides a high playability for its size! With the two quads, which fit nicely into children&#39;s hands, even two or three kids could be entertained at once. The build is also manageable for younger kids. It would make a very nice gift for growing LEGO fans! And price around 15&euro; is quite good for this set.</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-06-02T18:12:42.263Z","A lot of 4x4's for one set","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>A nice city set, and to me a nice addition to my collection of Lego City Vehicle sets. To me it was a quick and fun build. The quads offer a lot of racing around, with the two nice minifigures&nbsp;manning them. The SUV is good looking, and big enough to transport a quad itself. IMHO this is quite a nice set for its price.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>Building the quads is quick and somewhat repetitive. In general, IMHO, this set is a nice example of the efficient use of pieces and techniques by the designer.&nbsp;One could easily build the quads at the same time (since the construction steps are the same, only red pieces are substituted for the yellow pieces in the second quad. The SUV build again is simple. The designer has done quite a good job in hiding bright (and off-colour) bricks and place in the structure. They are only slightly visible through the wheel wells. The stickers are very effective, and fairly easy to place. Take care however, as them being placed improperly will be very noticeable.</p>

<p>Personally I liked building this set, mostly because I expected it to be simple. Overall, it took me about 40 minutes to put it together.</p>

<p>The recommended age range is 5-12, and I think 5 years olds should be able to put this set together easily. The only thing for the adults left to do is apply the stickers.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are two minifigures&nbsp;included in this set: a female quad racer (with appropriate torso print) with a nice bit of hair and helmet. There is also a male driver, wearing a hoodie rather than a racing jacket, that could man the second quad. For him there is a second helmet. Both minifigs have a single face print. They are good, IMHO, but nothing special.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The SUV has a nicely executed colour scheme of black and gray, with white striping. It is a nice representation of a big SUV, capable of carrying a quad on in the flat bed and a trailer with the second vehicle. The four stickers (on the hood, the roof and the sides) are well done, and break up the large black and grey planes nicely.&nbsp; There are two small on-ramps to get a quad on the bed; the ramp is steep, but fairly realistic. There is a small opening in the bed for the rear wheels of the SUV, but this is free from the wheels of the quad.</p>

<p>The trailer is simple, but looks well suited for the job and in proportion to the SUV (perhaps even a little on the small side).&nbsp; Add in a small petrol barrel/pump, a spare wheel, and the whole thing looks well.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This, to me, is above all a play set. Three vehicles to drive around, two of them that could race each other. Spare tires and such. It is IMHO good enough and big enough to use as a small display piece; however, IMHO&nbsp;the colour scheme does not work out too well for a display.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>This small set is IMHO a nice representation of a few amateurs or family transporting their quads into the outdoors to have a nice drive. Especially the SUV&nbsp;lacks the stickers and flamboyance to represent&nbsp;a true racing team. The design is simple, yet effective, and overall I think the designer(s) have done a great job. There is, of course, always a little room for improvement in this type of sets. That said, I think this is a nice set, that offers good value for money.</p>

"Almabeach","2019-02-14T23:20:56.05Z","Gorgeous and perfect","<p>I am what you call a AFOL who grew up with Lego until the mid-90s and like many others, I became kind of mad at the new Lego sets for becoming less simple and too detailed. I got back into Legos gradually over the last couple years but I still preferred my classics from the 80&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>This little set blew my mind. It&rsquo;s the first Lego set that I bought for my son and I am really glad to have chosen that one as he loves it as much as I do. It was also quite cheap for what it is. Around 25$ if I&nbsp;remember correctly.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7821/47139475752_c96aac3a54.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 319px;"" /></p>

<p>It is simply gorgeous. A fun build that makes for a fun playing time. It puts my old trucks and little square cars to shame with its slick design that still keeps the charm of Traditional Legos but with a modern touch. The colors are not as playfull for the truck but the 4 wheelers make up for it.</p>

<p>Here you can compare this truck with my old stuff to see what I mean.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7828/32249466397_fe90a83235.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 285px;"" /></p>

<p>The best feature of this set is the playability as it is very fun to load and unload the 4 wheelers and drive around. There&rsquo;s also the added bonus of the repair station on the trailer with tools and a spare tire.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7874/32249466507_c1870d1e97.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>So to conclude, this is one the most realistic set I ever had and it is simply a lot of fun.</p>
