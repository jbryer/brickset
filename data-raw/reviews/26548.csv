"Gerbil","2017-04-06T03:43:13.793Z","Better than expected!","<p>No full length review because this is a smaller set, but I must say it exceeded my expectations as I bought it really only for the small catamaran because&nbsp;a friend of mine has one and I had an excellent time on it.</p>

<h2>The Good:</h2>

<p>The catamaran is lovely, no other way to describe it. The lines are smooth and despite the simplicity, there&#39;s still space for a few finishing touches such as the new quarter circle pieces on both hulls. The net is perfectly replicated by the mesh plate, and the sail itself is a nice thick piece of flexible plastic.<br />
<br />
The trailer is simple, but with nice reinforcement techniques, which weren&#39;t necessary but gives it some great snot pieces. The curved piece reinforcing the wheel axles was unexpected but a lovely detail.</p>

<p>The 4 x 4 is vastly better than I thought it would be. I&#39;d not really paid attention to it due to focusing on the catamaran and because I&#39;ve been disappointed by 4 x 4s in the past. Firstly the colour scheme is nice - the green very much putting me in mind of Jeeps. The main body is fairly standard, but the details on the front, and particularly the bull bars are extremely nicely done, giving it a nicer, more accurate look than others in my collection.</p>

<p>The male figure is nothing special, but the female in wetsuit is awesome, with a nice printed pattern in a vibrant light blue!</p>

<h2>The Bad:</h2>

<p>The interior of the jeep has a few holes that aren&#39;t strictly necessary, but really the only true niggle is that there&#39;s no specific way of storing the sail when transporting the catamaran on the trailer. However, the catamaran is far more likely to be sailing around your collection, so this isn&#39;t too much of a problem (or rather, it is a problem of many of these &#39;4 x 4s with trailer&#39; sets).</p>

<h2>The... Rest?</h2>

<p>The overall impression is great. Playability is high due to the various individual parts, and although the catamaran is the highlight, the 4 x 4 itself is an extremely high quality vehicle in its own right.<br />
<br />
I&#39;d love to have multiples of this, but the large sail means repetition would be obvious. This is not really a flaw of the set, but it is so good that just one isn&#39;t enough!</p>

"lentil","2017-05-16T19:56:39.427Z","Dull offering despite nice catamaran","<p>I bought this set because it had a catamaran, which is just such an elegant-looking watercraft. It will indeed look spiffy sailing on my LEGO sea, but other than that this set falls flat in my opinion. There is just not enough in the way of cute details/features/playability to make it stand out, especially compared to other similarly-priced City sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two minifigures are included: one male and one female. The male has on a black zippered jacket with lime green sleeves and detailing, and a blue ball cap. The female sports a nifty black wetsuit with bright blue trim and a wave logo. She has a long braided hairstyle and printed goggles for eyewear. They each have one of those optional yellow life vests that make their heads pop up awkwardly. The figs make sense with the set, but are nothing special.</p>

<h3>The 4x4</h3>

<p>The car is a sturdy-looking vehicle in green with grey trim and a white roof, and big, chunky wheels. The roof color seems very off, and does not go with the rest of the car at all. The bar element on the front does look nice. Otherwise the 4x4 is very lackluster, and one of the most boring LEGO cars I have encountered. The doors do not open, nor does the trunk/backseat area. In order to place riders inside, you must remove the roof (this not difficult to do, but annoying). There is no real seating inside - the front &quot;seat&quot; is simply a cheese slope placed on the floor, and the back area has no seating at all. The only detail inside the vehicle is a standard steering wheel. Interior space is small: at most two figs could ride in the car, or one driver plus some small cargo. Compared to the car in #60117 Van &amp; Caravan (which retails for the same price) for example, this 4x4 is pretty boring. The #60117 Van, for comparison, has doors that open and close, a steering wheel, gauges, and an actual seat for the driver, as well as additional seating and room in back for at least two passengers, plus some small cargo/pets. The Van also has nice looking tinted windows all around the sides and rear of the vehicle, and better detailing on the front and back grills. Compared to this, the 4x4 seems really meh and does not have much in the way of play potential.</p>

<h3>The Catamaran</h3>

<p>The catamaran does indeed cut a fine figure (as catamarans will), and is obviously the reason for this set&#39;s existence. It&#39;s a very simple design, but the sail in particular looks quite nice. Lovely color scheme and design on the sail print. The sail is attached to the boat with a fixed hinge, so that it can be positioned at various angles. It does not rotate 360 degrees though, only up and down. There are two fins on the back of the catamaran that can be angled as well, to steer the boat. The catamaran can be snapped onto a small two-wheeled trailer, which attaches to the back of the 4x4 with a ball joint.</p>

<h3>Playability and Value</h3>

<p>I think playability and value of this set is unfortunately low. The figures can be placed on the catamaran... or not. That&#39;s about it. It is entirely devoid of whimsical detail, and has literally no accessories other than the awkward life vests. Seems like they should have included a fish or dolphin or cooler or... really anything at all! If you are in the market for a playable City set in this price range, you&#39;d be much better served by the aforementioned #60117 Van &amp; Caravan, which in addition to the nice van, has a really nifty little trailer that hinges open and has sleeping quarters and a mini-kitchen inside, and also comes with a grill, some sausages, and a cute little dog! Or, the excellent #60147 Fishing Boat, which has various fun details including movable motors, a fishing rod that can actually catch fish, and a shark. Or the outstanding #60150 Pizza Van, which also has lots of little playable, whimsical details. These all retail for the same price as the Catamaran, but are so much more interesting in many ways. For just a bit more #60119 Ferry is also a great option for a vehicle and watercraft lover. With the 4x4 and Catamaran, they unfortunately seem to have busted the creative and budgetary wad on that sail piece, leaving no room for anything else of interest. If (like me) you just desire a catamaran for plopping down in your display, this is fine, but if you are expecting more from your LEGO set this will probably not satisfy.</p>

The best bang for your buck in my opinion is the 25$ price range, which features solid builds, fun models and excellent display options. As a bonus you can find these sets at Costco every holiday season for a deep discount if you&rsquo;re looking for multiples, parts or MOC options.

It&rsquo;s still eye catching blue and showcases the sets and contents very well. One thing to note from more recent LEGO City offerings, the boxes are trying to be more inclusive with images of female characters more prominent in the corners and of course when in the set themselves.</span></span></span></span></p>

The trailer build is a bit flat, heh, heh, it&rsquo;s got a lot of plates and looks quite nice, but the build is over fairly quickly.</span></span></span></span></p>
