"MonsterFighter","2017-01-04T09:43:04.72Z","Good, but not great.","<p>When the list of 2017 City sets came out, this (and I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone) was the one that generated the most interest and anticipation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a good idea, but it could have been done so much better. Much like Scott1 has said in his review&nbsp;of 60142, this is a set where there could have been a bit more effort and thought.</p>

<p>The parts are good and there are a couple of new colours&nbsp;- e.g the chips (of which more later) and the moped for example. Two minifigs; a chef and a customer? Or is she a delivery rider? If she is a delivery rider -&nbsp;which would be a bit strange with a &#39;mobile&#39; pizza kitchen - why do the pizza boxes sit so badly on the back of the moped? There is a table to sit and eat your food at, but the height of it is at minifig neck level. Just because the stem looks like a table support, doesn&#39;t make it the &#39;right&#39; part to use.</p>

<p>There are a few issues with the van:</p>

<p>There is an extra layer of bricks (compare the doors and cab bodywork with&nbsp;60017 for example). I&#39;m not sure why as all it seems to do is raise the counter up to minifig shoulder height. It also does something ugly which I can&#39;t quite put my finger on to the front end. Maybe it&#39;s the round headlights too? The menu stickers end up being above head height too.</p>

<p>Given that it is a pizza kitchen - why is there a microwave oven (I assume that is what the clear door is meant to represent) and why are there (gigantic) chips? Does anyone have chips with Pizza? My son decided they were breadsticks, which would make more sense I guess. There&#39;s also only pizza and a salad on the menu. Where&#39;s the salad in the design?&nbsp;The food choice maybe wasn&#39;t the easiest to depict in a mobile kitchen,&nbsp;but having decided on pizza the design didn&#39;t follow the food type. Given the wealth of food van designs floating around on Lego Ideas there are a lot of great designs and details in the public domain that could have been used to make a far better model.</p>

<p>The back of the van is pretty uninspiring&nbsp;and the brake lights seem to have been added as an afterthought on the bottom edge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, overall, the set is OK. But it could have been done so much better.</p>

"YellowHouse","2017-01-06T16:24:06.55Z","Great set!","<p>First of all I love the idea of the Pizza Van. I love the colors, the design and especially the new little pizza slices. This set also comes with a new female torso that I don&#39;t have as well as the chef&#39;s face that I didn&#39;t have. Another thing I like that will cause me to buy two of these sets are the stickers. I plan on making a City Pizza restaurant to accompany the van.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Price - I think the price point is excellent for this set since we get 249 pieces for $19.99.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability - I have two kids and the Pizza Van is a hit. The biggest problem is that the top doesn&#39;t easily pop off to play on the inside. It would have been nice to have some jumper plates on top to make the roof easily pop on and off for play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts - I think this set delivers (pun intended) excellent parts. The new pizza slices are awesome and I also love the set of fries which I&#39;ve only seen in one other set;&nbsp;Heartlake City Mall. We also get a scooter and umbrella table with two minifigures. My only complaint about the parts would be that they only gave us one full pizza. I would have liked two.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall - Overall I really enjoyed this set and plan to buy another one.&nbsp;</p>

"cutegeek1337","2017-01-09T00:59:46.95Z","Love it!","<p>I don&#39;t generally buy a lot of City sets because my Lego budget is typically depleted by Star Wars and Super Heroes sets (leaving little for the great sets in other themes).&nbsp; But I could not pass this up for my growing city of modular buildings.&nbsp; The set looks awesome, with a very distinctive color scheme and a great selection of stickers.&nbsp; The pizza slice pieces are perfect and the interior of the kitchen has several nice details like a cash register, controls for the oven, and breadsticks.</p>

<p>The minifigures are cute and I love the face on the chef.&nbsp; I would have liked a third one for the $20 price tag, but all in all I don&#39;t feel slighted on price.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only (minor) quibble I have is the roof of the van.&nbsp; I feel like they should have used something more colorful than light grey for the very top given that the entire exterior of van is yellow and dark red.&nbsp; Also, I would have preferred if the roof was designed to be easily removable to aid in posing minifigures inside the kitchen.&nbsp; I can imagine that some people might find it annoying to try and set up the chef by reaching through the open side panels.&nbsp; With the counters, you can&#39;t really reach the legs all that easily.</p>

<p>OK, I lied, there is one other small complaint.&nbsp; I don&#39;t like how the pizza box attaches to the moped.&nbsp; The parts included place the box off center, which looks like it would be very precarious in real life.&nbsp; Using a 1x2 plate with 1 knob instead of a 2x2 with a knob would have easily solved that.</p>

"Hashem1983","2017-04-13T15:05:15.837Z","I Couldn't Resist It!!!!!!","<p>When I first saw the announcement of the early 2017 sets I couldn&#39;t resist not having it, although I am not that fan of vehicles, but I loved this one.</p>

<p>It comes in a medium size box with the City branding on it, as usual the front side displays the set and on the back the multi features of this set. The set includes 2 instruction booklets and two numbered bags with a stickers sheet.</p>

<p>It has decent amount of parts, although most of them are general but&nbsp;some of them are new to my parts collection, I can say the unique pieces are the lime green umbrella and the printed Round 2X2&nbsp;Pizza and the 1X1 quarter round pizza, although it is one piece in this set but you get an extra spare part, also the 1x1 flat tile that has the digital numbers and the 1X1 soda can top, you get an extra spare for these&nbsp;parts.</p>

<p>The building experience was amazing from front to back, it gets exiting on the back when you are adding the mini stove and the other main appliances, I liked using the yellow crystal nuget as a French Fries. I didn&#39;t like the driving area that much as the driver sits in the middle and it feels incomplete, having a 6 stud wide vehicle should include 2 seats (MOT).</p>

<p>You get 2 minifiguers in this set, a chef and a girl who either be a costumer or a Pizza Delivery, it is up to you to decide.</p>

<p>I had an incedent with this set when it fell off the shelf, it felt down and only the roof top of the back vehicle got off, the rest was still connected, which means the set is sturdy.</p>

<p>In general its a very nice set, has nice building experience, nice selection of parts. It could be added to your city collection or near a restaurant or on a beach, or like I did, I put it in my office among side my other Lego Collection for Decoration.</p>

<p>Its a Lovely Set :)</p>

"KingAlanI","2017-03-29T02:55:39.82Z","OK, but not as good as Friends analogue","<p>My fat self had to get this to go with other LEGO pizzerias. #10036 Pizza To Go is a favorite from my kid collection, and #41092 Stephanie&#39;s Pizzeria is a set I liked from a couple years ago. (I also got #41311 Heartlake Pizzeria and #70910 Scarecrow Special Delivery from this year&#39;s new sets but haven&#39;t built 70910 yet.)</p>

<p>I like the yellow and dark red color scheme.<br />
I wish there had been a driver along with the chef. I grabbed one of my old minifigures. The back of the driver&#39;s compartment didn&#39;t leave enough room for a hairpiece. Hair and helmet may be realistic but leaves one sitting around; this was also a problem with set 41092.<br />
The contents of the kitchen are interesting parts but seem kind of random.<br />
Many pizza sets have more actual pizza parts. I would have particularly liked to see more of the new quarter slice tile.<br />
I don&#39;t like it as much as set 41311 but it&#39;s still not bad.</p>

"ShaCincy","2017-01-06T16:31:10.05Z","Very Cool!","<p>This set is very good for playability and is very good for the price. I like the new triangle element that is used as a pizza slice. I also think that the color scheme is very good. There is a lot of detail especially inside the van. I think it is a very good set overall, and if you&#39;re considering buying it, you definitely should!</p>

"Zapp_Brannigan","2018-12-29T21:43:58.343Z","Return of the pizza","<p>This is my first City set in six years as my last one was 4207 City Garage in 2012. Much of my interest in City sets became lost as the designs started to decline in quality, almost to the level of the juniorized&nbsp;era of the late 90s and early 2000s. Not only this, but the type of sets was being recycled constantly with an astronomical number of police and fire sets. Even the new sub-themes such as racing and recreation weren&#39;t all that interesting to me. After 2012, I spent much of the&nbsp;time instead slowly collecting modulars&nbsp;and pining over some of the more advanced sets from various themes. Then one day, I came across the Pizza Van which seemingly ended my City drought and disappointment.</p>

<p>As older fans of LEGO know, pizza has always been a staple to any city. As a bit of background for younger audiences, the first set to come with pizza was 6350 Pizza to Go from 1994 (I actually owned the re-released version from 2002) which included a generous five pizzas of <a href=""http://media.peeron.com/pics/inv/custpics/4150p02.1066527767.jpg"">this</a> type. This type of pizza is still produced today, but the 2x2 round flat tile design evolved several years ago such that it&nbsp;can now be centrally attached to a single stud without offset.</p>

<p>The pizza van was a welcome surprise as, to my knowledge, it is the first food truck produced in the City theme if you discount the various hot dog and ice cream stands which have existed in between. Build time was around half an hour and exceedingly easy considering I&#39;ve been spending recent history&nbsp;mostly buying sets with more than a thousand pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures&nbsp;include a chef and female civilian/delivery person. A red scooter is included with pizza boxes ready for delivery, as well as a patio table with a new design for the umbrella I&#39;ve never seen before in a nice lime green. The female minifigure&#39;s&nbsp;head piece can be swapped to a helmet when she&#39;s driving the scooter. The food truck itself looks really nice with the yellow and burgundy. The front hood piece is also one I&#39;ve never seen before and makes the van look really sleek. The kitchen is fairly compact with an oven, pop can, fries, cash register, condiments dispensers, and a whole pizza of the <a href=""https://www.lego.com/service/bricks/5/2/6174830"">new</a> kind. Also included are <a href=""https://www.lego.com/service/bricks/5/2/6175469"">1x1 quarter circle pieces</a> which represent individual pizza slices. A spare pizza slice was included, so in reality you&#39;re getting two slices.&nbsp;The van&#39;s side panels open on both sides but access to the small kitchen is a bit difficult without tearing the roof off. Stickers are included for the menu, logos, and pizza box.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To conclude this is the first City set I&#39;ve come across in a long time which has not fallen under my &quot;easy pass&quot; list. At $25 CAD this is a very good deal for a City set being exactly 10 cents per piece. Being out for almost 2 years I&#39;m not sure how much longer it&#39;ll stay available. Who knows how long it will be until the next City set impresses me.</p>

"city_transport_rox","2017-06-16T05:52:07.75Z","Make more pizza (and more city sets like these) ","<p>When someone mentions LEGO City the first thing that would come to mind for most people would be a police or fire station. And these subthemes make up something like 70% of all City sets. But sometimes there would be something else that can be used for everyday city life, just like this. This is a great addition to any City or Town of any size. LEGO City does not release as many food outlets as the Friends theme so this one is definitely one to grab for City fans.&nbsp;The set comes with two minifigures: a&nbsp;male chef and a female who can either be seen as an employee or a customer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The truck itself is a nice size with a bright&nbsp;colour scheme that stands out and works well with the dark red. It has some stickers, not too many and I feel they work quite well such as the one on the pizza box. The set comes with several notable parts including a pizza&nbsp;with a brand new print, a vespa motor scooter, a large green umbrella and even a crystal piece in yellow which represents french fries/chips (depending on where you come from). For younger kids playability is great because this set can be placed almost anywhere, whether its simply in the middle of a city on the side of the street or near a park, or even as a food truck in a festival or event - the possibilities are endless really.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A minor criticism would be the fact the roof does not easily come off which would make interior access even easier, especially to place multiple minifigures. But this is only a small issue and overall this is a great set, definitely a must buy for LEGO fans of all ages who have a LEGO City or simply just collect vehicles. It is definitely one of my favourite LEGO City sets for 2017 and I&#39;m sure its popularity will continue into next year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"astratow","2018-02-07T08:30:08.357Z","Great value for money","<p>I could not resist to buy it for just a little less than 12 pound which makes less than 6 p per piece!</p>

<p>But when I built the van I found it impressive! People are complaining about difficult to remove top of the van, but I think it&#39;s actually a good thing and represents wider philosophy behind design of this model. It is solid and it doesn&#39;t fall apart as easy as other city sets I bought for my boy. When it comes to play it&#39;s awesome. The door in the cab are opening (not like 60107, where piece of brick represents the door and keeps coming off), the back of the van opens up as well and both are solid built that you cannot complain about.</p>

<p>Yellow colour is one of my child favourites so I am happy with it as well, but I was surprised that there is not so many yellow parts when it come to build it. It&#39;s just a cover:) Tricky.</p>
