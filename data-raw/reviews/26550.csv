"Loerwyn","2017-01-06T19:59:41.273Z","Great build, but not perfect!","<p>This set is pretty easy to review for the most part. It&#39;s mostly really solid, especially the dragster and the (completed) cab unit and the parts go together well. It also continues with City&#39;s increasing focus on balancing its world with both a male and a female minifig present, and you&#39;re free to have whichever you choose as the driver of the racer, though the distribution of parts and box marketing imply that the male is. Mind you, the box also shows the dragster on the back of the trailer with flames still coming out of its exhausts, so you can take that with a pinch of salt if you wish. The build isn&#39;t complicated (especially for an AFOL), and when you&#39;ve finished, you have a very pleasing looking set of models.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think many of the parts will be particularly interesting to most builders (though I can see the 90 degree pipe corners used for the exhausts - of which there&#39;s six! - being popular with Technic and Star Wars creators), but I really like the long, curving slopes used for the front of the dragster as they are both functional (they add support to the build in my opinion) and go well with the model. The use of parts to add colour, such as the truck cab) is very well done and helps the set really go together.</p>

<p>There are a few little bits that I wasn&#39;t so keen on, though. The trailer feels like it bends a little due to the fairly weak structure. It&#39;s two 6x12 plates that mostly rest on two 2x16 plates which run down the center, and I couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that it wasn&#39;t a flush fit - though it may just be that the grip on my bricks is almost too good! I would just have liked a little more support, however. The build of the cab is flimsy at two points too, with the front bumper connection prone to popping off until the grill holds its connecting block down, and its wing mirrors are best attached at the 90 degree angle they&#39;re meant to be as trying to push them up at that stage will likely cause the window to pop off. Finally, the starting light is made of four stacked <!--StartFragment-->Brick 1X1 W. 2 Knobs<!--EndFragment--> and it&#39;s awful to try to keep them perfectly flush, especially when pushing the gems in for the lights.</p>

<p>Overall I think this is a good set for someone who wants either something simple and pleasing, or a good truck base to use. It wouldn&#39;t take much to convert the trailer to hold other models, and I think it&#39;d easily fit into a lot of collections.</p>

<p>This is a fairly little set (in piece-count as well as price), that ends up with a massive truck in Lego City scale. As I generally like the Lego City trucks and trailers, this one was on my wish list. The designer has done a pretty good job with the colour scheme, and the way it is implemented on the truck and the dragster. The tractor looks good, and is a fairly nice build. There are only two minifigures, both quite simple but nice looking. The build was 50 minutes of easy fun, that leaves one with a massive trailer and big dragster to play around with, or display.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>Overall this was a fun, easy build. Overall it took me about 50 minutes; the given age range is 5-12 years old, and indeed most 5 year olds should be able to build this set, apart from applying the stickers.In total there are 10 stickers in this set, that IMHO are very useful in breaking up large planes of colour&nbsp;really effectively. Lego should IMHO be complimented for them. The blue in the stickers is slightly darker than the blue bricks, but the orange in the stickers seems to match the orange bricks pretty much perfectly.</p>

<p>There are no difficult construction sequences, only a few slightly more than basic&nbsp;assemblies at the front and putting on the main window.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are only two minifigures, a male racing driver and a female truck driver, that presumably could also race (as both are wearing gloves, and their expressions match tension and determination and the start). Both have a single face print, and identical torsos (colour and print on both sides). Unfortunately, there is only one helmet. The lady has white legs, the man blue.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The tractor-trailer combination overall looks IMHO very good. I like the colour combination, and the overall dimensions. Arguably the trailer could have been a little shorter. Although looking good, I second the suggestion of another reviewer that the whole bed might be structurally too thin, and sag eventually.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I like the design of the dragster, simple but effective. Generally I like the colour-combination, although I am not too convinced with the red for the engine. The stickers look really good, IMHO, and are not overdone.</p>

<p>The tractor is a good looking design, that looks the part, pulling such a massive trailer. Nice is the single mug at the front of the truck. Overall this seems to be a design that could easily be copied and adapted to fit ones own creations. Even the flatbed trailer could be adapted to suit other needs...</p>

<p>To me this is one of the most impressive and good looking tractor-trailer sets Lego has released to date for its City theme.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>Mostly this is a play set - the &#39;Christmas tree&#39; start lights, the dragster, the truck that can be moved around. With slight adaptations, the trailer can be used to carry other vehicles as well. That said, IMHO the set is big enough, designed well enough&nbsp;and striking enough to be used as a small display set.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>I am happy I was able to get this set at a price slightly under the old RRP. Overall, I think this is a good set, that offers good value for money. If you like tractor-trailers and striking vehicles, than this set is worthy of consideration.&nbsp;</p>
