<p style=""text-align:start; margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:400""><span style=""white-space:normal""><span style=""-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3)"">Now onto the review</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start; margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:start; margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:400""><span style=""white-space:normal""><span style=""-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3)"">&nbsp; &nbsp;The box shows the man jackhammering the building and the excavator scooping up the bricks and loading them into the truck. The back shows different features of the set. There are 3 instruction books. One builds the excavator, another builds most of the truck, the final builds the sweeper and trailer for the truck. The instructions are pretty easy to follow, and I have not noticed any mistakes so far.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start; margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:start; margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:400""><span style=""white-space:normal""><span style=""-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3)"">&nbsp; &nbsp;This set contains a number of interesting and useful pieces, despite its size. Notable mentions include the sweeper brush pieces and housings (4 of them, and 2 housings, more than previous street sweeper sets, most notably 7242, which include only one housing and two brushes), the 8x8 grid plate, the excavator&rsquo;s arm and bucket, the roll cage piece, the turntable, the ball joints, the plates with hinges used on the trailer ramp, the truck&rsquo;s fenders, the hinged side gates on the truck&rsquo;s bed, and the curved bricks on the back of the excavator. Plus, there is a surplus of bricks with clips on them, so if you are looking for some, this set has you covered! And yes, it has some normal bricks and plates, which are always useful! There are a few 1x2 bricks with the molded &ldquo;brick&rdquo; pattern on the side in a brick-red color; I thought those were neat!</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start; margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Minifigs/Accessories</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:start; margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:400""><span style=""white-space:normal""><span style=""-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3)"">&nbsp; &nbsp;There are 2 construction worker mini-figures in the set, a man and a woman. The man has an orange safety vest, tan pants, a belt with a pocket holding pliers, a red hard hat with ear protection, and a smiley grin and orange goggles on his face. The woman has an orange safety vest, a belt with a pocket holding a radio, blue pants,&nbsp;a red hard hat with a ponytail attached, and a seemingly serene expression.&nbsp;There&nbsp;is also a little building to demolish, a sign, two pylons, and 4 tools: a shovel, broom, wrench, and jackhammer (or pneumatic drill).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start; margin-bottom:11px""><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:start; margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:400""><span style=""white-space:normal""><span style=""-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3)"">&nbsp; &nbsp;It took about 20 minutes to build. You start with the excavator and little building, then the truck, starting with the chassis and going up, and then the sweeper, which attaches to the front of the truck, then the trailer.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:400""><span style=""white-space:normal""><span style=""-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3)"">And yes, it does have stickers, just so you know, thought I don&#39;t really mind them!</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start; margin-bottom:11px""><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p style=""text-align:start; margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:400""><span style=""white-space:normal""><span style=""-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3)"">&nbsp; &nbsp;The excavator&rsquo;s arm moves up and down, bends and straightens at several joints, and the bucket tips, to scoop or empty its load. The range of motion is impressive. The body swivels 360 degrees. The wheels roll nicely, and it looks good too. It has two headlights and an orange beacon light on top. The truck is also cool and realistic, and resembles a Mercedes-Benz Unimog. It sports many details, including mirrors, beacon lights, fuel tanks, step ladders, grab handles, etc. It has beefy wheels and rubber tires, as well as&nbsp;high ground clearance for driving off-road. The sweeper unit on the&nbsp;front has rotating brushes and can be raised and lowered and turned left and right via a ball joint piece. The sweeper unit can also be easily removed from the front of the truck if necessary. The cab has opening doors, and can fit a mini-figure. The cargo bed has lots of space to fit bricks or signs/cones. There are 4 clips for fitting the tools in the set. The sides of the cargo bed fold down. There is also a hitch at the back for the trailer. The trailer has a ramp that raises and lowers, so that excavator can easily roll on or off of the trailer, as well as a detailed rear bumper with tail lights and signals. All in all, there is a lot of play value and detail in this set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start; margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:400""><span style=""white-space:normal""><span style=""-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3)"">&nbsp; &nbsp;Sadly, there are a couple of flaws. First, the excavator&rsquo;s arm does not quite lift high enough to load bricks into the truck. You have to lift it off the ground in order to load. Also, when sweeping, hair, and dirt can get caught in the sweeper brushes, making them difficult to turn. I constantly have to clean the sweeper brushes out. Lastly, I have had a weird problem &ndash; after some play, the axles or wheels on the truck and excavator seem to have worn down so that the wheels come off a lot now. It seems that the pieces are made of a slightly softer plastic that they used to be???</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start; margin-bottom:11px"">This set seems to be appropriately priced for its part count.</p>

<p style=""text-align:start; margin-bottom:11px""><b>Overall opinion&nbsp;</b></p>

<p style=""text-align:start; margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:400""><span style=""white-space:normal""><span style=""-webkit-tap-highlight-color:rgba(26, 26, 26, 0.3)"">&nbsp; &nbsp;Overall, this is an excellent construction set. It may not be the biggest or most exciting set out there, but it is well-designed and contains a decent array of pieces.&nbsp;I highly recommend it. Just be cautious of the&nbsp;soft plastic problem, which I experienced on a few sets in 2017.</span></span></span></span></p>
