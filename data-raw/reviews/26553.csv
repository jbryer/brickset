<p>LEGO 76079 (along with the other Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume 2 sets) is finally here! My thoughts? Read on!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Builds</strong></p>

<p>The main builds of this set are Taserface&#39;s&nbsp;ship and a piece of forest scenery. While the ship does feature four stud shooters mounted onto the top and bottom of the model, which adds to play, I do feel that the overall build is lacking in display value, with the majority of&nbsp;studs left exposed, and a blocky finished product.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The colors are nice, with the transition from the dark bluish grey of the wings leading into black plates, and eventually the Ravager red. Obviously, the Taserface&nbsp;minifigure can be easily placed into the cockpit of the ship.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vehicle also features a clip on the rear end to store a blaster.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The piece of scenery definitely adds to the overall playability of this set. The tree build looks satisfying for such a small set, and the Gatling gun styled&nbsp;stud shooter looks alright.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favorite aspect of the build is definitely the little Milano wing that is attached to the tree via ball point. It looks fantastic, and really sets up a scenario of the Milano having crashed onto this planet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Figures</b></p>

<p>The line up of characters that this set offers is nothing shy of fantastic. Each figure is 100% exclusive (for now) to 76079, which makes this set a must buy for fans, as it includes the new Guardians member Mantis, as well as the excellently designed Taserface and an updated Rocket Raccoon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Rocket figure included in this set is a drastic departure from the 2014 version of the character, which sported a bright orange costume and a blank mouth design. This 2017 redesign looks even better than the original figure in my opinion, which to me is a trait that many of the redesigned Guardians seem to lack. Rocket&#39;s torso is reddish brown, and includes some extremely detailed dark blue and dark bluish grey detailing on the torso, which depicts various zippers and buckles. Rocket&#39;s short legs are also dark blue, and the same tail the figure came with in 2014 is included with this set as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rocket also features a wide, cocky smirk on his face, which is an excellent addition to the figure. Two brick built pistols are included for Rocket to wield.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mantis figure utilizes a brand new rubberized hairpiece, which allows for the character&#39;s thin antennae to be molded to the hairpiece. Mantis features two facial expressions, one featuring a kind smile, and the other showcasing a crazed aggressive expression.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mantis&#39;s torso is very detailed, and features contrasts between light and dark green, which I think looks fantastic. Mantis&#39;s legs are left unprinted.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taserface is a character that, I will admit, I know nothing about, although judging by the torso print, it seems he may be a member of Yondu&#39;s Ravagers. Taserface&nbsp;has a light purple head,&nbsp;which is printed with sunken in yellow eyes, and various scar details. The figure uses a common beard piece in black, and a hairpiece that, if I&#39;m not mistaken, has only ever been used by an Orc minifigure from the Hobbit theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figure also features some substantial leg printing, depicting various straps and padding. Lastly, Taserface wields a large, brickbuilt&nbsp;rocket launcher that is built off of a stud shooter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Verdict</b></p>

<p>The Superheroes line always has fantastic $20 sets, and 76079: Ravager Attack is certainly no different. While Taserface&#39;s ship may be a little lacking in terms of displayability and collectability, I feel the play &nbsp;value is solid enough to warrant a pass. The terrain build is exceptional, and the 3 exclusive minifigures add even more value to this set. Overall, I&#39;d say that while this set is definitely not the best Guardians 2 set, it is one that is worth checking out, as it features some solid builds, and fantastic figures. I&#39;d give this set a 7.5/10.</p>

It does manage to capture the fun of the sequel though and we do get quite a lot of fun models in these sets. This is the smallest price-point and it&rsquo;s a strong outing, the reasons why will be discussed during the review.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Guardians are in the upper corner and the logo is in the bottom corner making it very clear which MCU film these sets represent.</span></span></span></span></p>

They are fairly standard and what we&rsquo;ve come to expect from LEGO Instruction Manuals; the modular nature of the build means there are fairly easy steps to follow and a page in the back shows all three sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

Her hair piece is quite unique and is a softer rubbery plastic which fits quite snugly on her head.</span></span></span></span></p>

A fun little mini-fig and definitely a must have for Rocket fans.</span></span></span></span></p>

He includes a massive cannon built out of bricks all using the stud launcher piece as a base so you can launch studs at the Guardians.</span></span></span></span></p>

This section of the build is pretty straight forward and doesn&rsquo;t strike me as difficult for younger builders. The ship itself is a nice red, black and grey colour combination that looks good. No stickers will be used during this bag&rsquo;s build.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 2: Rocket joins Mantis to defend against Taserface, his ship is completed here and stickers will now be placed for detailing, on both the ship and the secondary tree model with wrecked portions of the Milano. This build is also really simple and easy to get through though, which makes sense for a set of this size range. There really isn&rsquo;t any techniques used that do anything different or unique that would upset or frustrate the younger builders.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Taserface&rsquo;s Ship: This model is the larger of the two in the set and represents a smaller craft, roughly fighter-like in design and function. It&rsquo;s a small one-man vehicle loaded with four stud launchers to attack the Guardians; a very fun model for playing with, it&rsquo;s great just swooshing this around for KFOLs or AFOLs. The overall shape and design reminds me of a bow or boomerang, a very distinctive design, there&rsquo;s also storage for one weapon in the back on a clip. In case you lose the other accessory Taserface comes with.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Defense Platform: This is basically a small tree with pieces of the wrecked Milano added, a large six-stud launcher graces one side of the tree to blow Taserface away and the wing attached on the opposite side is meant for&hellip; defense? Maybe Rocket crouches down behind it to launch energy blasts from his two guns. Overall a bit of a lacking build, we&rsquo;ve seen and built many trees before in similar fashion, it might have been nicer to get a small bunker shaped construction using parts of the Milano. Either way it isn&rsquo;t accurate to the scene as shown in the film.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

The ship and small defensive area don&rsquo;t look like much when put side to side considering the Nova Corps ship from the first movie was a larger design. However I&rsquo;d say this is a pretty good set, it includes two brand new characters and some fun play elements, you&rsquo;ll definitely want this set if you&rsquo;re a fan of GotG so I&rsquo;d say this is recommended. The strength of that recommendation depends purely on how much you enjoy Guardians of the Galaxy Volume Two.</span></span></span></span></p>
