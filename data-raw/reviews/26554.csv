"xboxtravis7992","2017-04-04T23:20:11.3Z","Foxy on the Run","<p>With the upcoming release of&nbsp;<em>Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 2</em>, the hype surrounding the film is very palpable right now. The film, a sequel to the 2014 film; continues the adventures of a band of misfits in the far corners of space in the Marvel Universe. Since the film has yet to be released, the Lego sets that correspond to it can only be judged by the previous film, trailers, and the content seen in the original comic source material. With that said, this set contains several things which will be of interest to fans of the series.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The set contains three minifigures and one micro-fig.</p>

<p><em>Star Lord</em></p>

<p>Chris Pratt&#39;s intergalactic outlaw returns to Lego form in this set. The head piece is the same piece used for Pratt&#39;s character in the Jurassic World sets, the original Star Lord figures from 2014, and also on Bucky Barnes (Winter Soldier) from 2015&#39;s Captain America sets. The hair piece was used previously in 2016&#39;s Captain America sets for Steve Rogers. The dual pistols Star Lord uses return from 2014; they are unique to Star Lord and will certainly appeal to Lego sci-fi fans. I believe the torso print is new. The character wears a jet pack, instead of the yellow foot boosters the character had in 2014. The jet pack is a simple brickbuilt&nbsp;accessory, which uses the binoculars piece, a 1x1 tile and a neck bracket. The only complaint I have is the lack of the character&#39;s signature helmet piece.</p>

<p><i>Yondu</i></p>

<p>While Yondu&nbsp;was a pivotal character in the 2014 film, this is his first release in Lego form. His red &quot;fin&quot; is a new piece casted in transparent red. My set came with a spare fin, useful if the original ever gets lost. Yondu&#39;s head, torso and leg prints are all new. He comes with a golden arrow (which my set also had a spare of) that represents the arrows he controls via some form of telekinesis in the films. He is a spectacular figure, and completes an aspect which was missing in the 2014 &nbsp;sets.</p>

<p><em>Ayesha&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>I have to admit I am not familiar with this character beyond what I have seen in the trailers. As such it is strange that the figure is wearing a dark blue suit (not unlike Lego&#39;s Agents theme from previous years) instead of the golden ceremonial attire seen in the trailers. The combination of gold and dark blue, while pleasing; doesn&#39;t really stand out. As such it is my least favorite of the three minifigures from this set. I imagine the parts will be useful to sci-fi minifigures customizers, and perhaps my view on the figure will change after I am introduced to the character in the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Groot</em></p>

<p>Of course discussing the figures would not be complete without mentioning the micro-figure in this set, baby Groot. Groot comes in the current Milano set too, but the print is different between the two versions. Groot here is wearing a red jacket, and looks rather good. He can grab onto Lego clips since his hand is the size of the 1m bar used in many Lego sets. Full sized Lego figures in turn can grab his hand. He is a great little figure, and I am sure will be a highly collectible part of this set.</p>

<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>

<p>The set build can be divided between three individual components.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Rocks</em></p>

<p>Probably the most throwaway feature of this set is a pile of red, alien, rock formations. A part of it can be &quot;exploded&quot; by pushing down a red stud which activates a hidden lever. There is no real display value in this part, although kids might find it fun to activate the exploding feature, even placing figures such as Groot onto the stud to push it down.</p>

<p><em>Micro Pod</em></p>

<p>I had hopes this was some sort of micro pod for Groot, but later analysis of the trailers showed it in use by what seems to be Ayesha&#39;s forces. The pod lacks an interior due to the small size. However it is solid, and well detailed; especially with the use of the new curved plates. While not the main attraction of the set, it feels like it could add to the fun.</p>

<p><em>Main Pod</em></p>

<p>Continuing the theme shown in the first film where many of the galaxy&#39;s ships look like some sort of submarine, this large yellow pod looks more aquatic than it does look like a spaceship. The build is solid, and it holds together well. The curved pieces used give it a smooth, almost studless&nbsp;build. The method of seating&nbsp;a figure into the pod is rather inventive, with the roof sliding back and the seat moving with it. The panels on the side open up to reveal cabinets to store extra accessories. There is also a red fire extinguisher, continuing a long running gag with Lego Marvel sets!! This pod&nbsp;uses several stickers, which help enhance the detailing on the ship. The spring loaded missile is attached in an awkward spot, where the tail end of the missile bumps into a plate behind it, causing it to not fire well. To be useful, the missile brick must be moved forward one stud further than it is show to be in the instructions, which is not very esthetically pleasing. This is something I wish had been corrected in the official build.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Ultimately this is a solid set, with good figures. However, it so far suffers from the lack of iconic builds which would be recognizable to a Marvel fan. The main pod is nowhere near as recognizable as the Milano, Quinjet, or Helicarrier. As such, this set<em> feels</em> like it is intended to include a background ship, which will ultimately play second fiddle to the other ships of the film. That is unfortunate this ship seems so forgettable, although perhaps we might be surprised and see &quot;the yellow pod&quot; play a major role when the film arrives this May! Until then, it feels like this set was mostly a means of releasing several desired figures together in one package. With that said, the set includes enough that it could be a fun play item for kids getting their first Guardians of the Galaxy set. It also will satisfy the collector who is looking to complete their Guardians of the Galaxy collection with the new figures, but not ready to plop down the money for another iteration of a more popular vehicle which was previously released. Ultimately, if someone intends to collect the Guardians of the Galaxy V.2 sets, this will be a fine; if somewhat forgettable, addition to their collection.</p>

Ayesha&#39;s&nbsp;drone has some nice gold pieces and stud shooters on the side. There is also a little red exploding rock build.</p>

<p>The mini figs included are star-lord, baby Groot, Ayesha&nbsp;and Yondu. These mini figures&nbsp;are fantastic!</p>

<p>Overall i think that this set is the best of the Guardians of the galaxy sets and is defiantly worth every penny and i would recommend this set to anyone because of its cool and unique build and awesome exclusive mini figs.</p>

Where Knowhere Escape featured some pretty questionable gimmicks and a lackluster model, this set gives us two space craft and some decent Minifigures. It&rsquo;s also priced ten dollars cheaper, so really this one has improved on the overall choices LEGO makes for such sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

To control her ship she includes a remote control accessory&hellip; *SIGH* really not accurate to the move.</span></span></span></span></p>

The level of detail on his print is also quite impressive and I&rsquo;m sure a lot of folks are going to want this and love it to death. It is easily lost unfortunately.</span></span></span></span></p>

His accessories are still the two little blasters, but now you also have a small jet pack built onto a back bracket. (Really just a pair of binoculars attached to a 1x1 tile, but hey, it&rsquo;s something.) Definitely the weakest of the bunch only because he&rsquo;s not new, but still very impressive.</span></span></span></span></p>

Heh, heh. He&rsquo;s a solid looking figure dressed in his Ravager outfit with double-sided torso printing, some leg printing and a great looking expression on his face, he&rsquo;s clearly enjoying himself a great deal. His new Mohawk hair piece is great and two is included in the set. He does not come with an accurate arrow accessory unfortunately, LEGO decided to give him the old Aquanaut torpedo piece for his arrow, which works I&rsquo;ll grant you, but doesn&rsquo;t look nearly skinny enough to represent the piece properly.</span></span></span></span></p>

This shouldn&rsquo;t take longer than fifteen minutes to complete, you also have a small section of rock with a gimmick play feature included, it&rsquo;s a very tiny amount of parts to build up something truly impressive, but we&rsquo;ll go over that in the completed model section.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bag 3: Yondu joins the cast and the collection of Marvel Minifigures with this bag, you finish off his ship with the pieces in this bag and I am surprised to see just how much fun it is once you start completing the model. There are some stickers used for extra detailing, the placement of which is on some sloped bricks, so they need to be placed with care and may require assistance when building. Overall this entire build from Bag 2 on is actually pretty satisfying.</span></span></span></span></p>

The ship looks great and is really fun to just fly around, it&rsquo;s very easy to grip due to the small elongated design perfect for smaller hands. One pressure based flick-fire missile launcher is included for extra play. Overall a very fun model and design, definitely the star of the set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Ayesha&rsquo;s Ship: This little model is all not entirely to scale compared to the vessels seen in the film. On top of that I kind of wish they&rsquo;d printed Ayesha&rsquo;s Minifigure into the clear blue parts to replicate how the ships actually looked when you saw the &lsquo;pilots&rsquo; in the film, as it stands the fact that she&rsquo;s using a remote control to fly the ship is really not accurate to the movie version at all.</span></span></span></span></p>

Overall both ships in the set are really fun and a pleasure to build.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">You also have a small piece of red terrain, push down on a switch and this blows up simulating the climax of the movie, it&rsquo;s pretty negligible and not worth spending too much time on honestly. I would have preferred it if they just had a proper control station for the ship built instead with this feature, because then you could pretend to blow up the control station with Ayesha sitting in it and have even more interesting adventures.</span></span></span></span></p>

This is the cheapest method to getting a Baby Groot and features him in his Ravager costumer which is ten times more adorable than the plain brown version of Baby Groot. Just like with the first film&rsquo;s releases LEGO has done a bang up job with the Guardians of the Galaxy Volume Two sets and you definitely can&rsquo;t go wrong picking them all up for your display.</span></span></span></span></p>
