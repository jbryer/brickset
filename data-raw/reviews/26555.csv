<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>The front of the box features the Milano swooping in to take on the Abilisk, another tentacled monster from today&#39;s lineup of fantasy films. The box art for this sub-theme is nice enough although it&#39;s not my favorite. I wish they would use the&nbsp;&quot;LEGOified&quot;&nbsp;version of the characters in the top-right hand corner like they do on the back and sides.</p>

<p>Inside the bag there are four numbered bags and each are decently filled which is nice for a set of this size.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bag 1 builds the Abilisk, and the frame of the Milano.</p>

<p>Bag 2 completes the center of the Milano.</p>

<p>Bag 3 builds the first wing.</p>

<p>Bag 4 builds the second wing and adds some final detail.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Bag 3 builds the first wing.</p>

<p>Bag 4 builds the second wing and adds some final detail.</p>

<p>There are some interesting technics used to achieve certain angles for the craft, especially the front of the wings. This is similar to a technic used for the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76032-1/The-Avengers-Quinjet-City-Chase"">Quinjet City Chase</a>&nbsp;set.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>A variety of rarer parts are included in this set as well as a variety of pieces in Bright Pink for the first time. I listed a few of the more unique pieces I found below.</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6177923/neck-tail-link-%C3%B87-84-%C3%B86-47"">6177923</a>&nbsp;in Bright Purple</li>

</ul>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Peter Quill (Star-Lord) is up first. He and Gamora share a new print for their armor which resembles what is shown in the film. They also share the same leg print which was introduced for Hawkeye in Civil War. I really wished there would be more to distinguish those two characters but swapping torsos isn&#39;t too bad. He comes with both his hairpiece and helmet, two blasters, and a small build for a jetpack.</p>

<p>Gamora, as mentioned earlier&nbsp;uses the same torso and legs as Star-Lord. Although, according to the database she has a brand new face and hair print. She also comes with a singular katana although two are included in the set.</p>

<p>Drax&nbsp;might be my favorite character in this set. I really like the print on his torso, including his arms. I appreciate the subtle implementation of the LEGO skeleton heads for his tattoos. He comes with his customary twin daggers and the same jetpack as Star-Lord.</p>

<p>Unlike the other characters in this set, Nebula is much different than her predecessor. This version of the character shows off her torn outfit and the battle damaged she sustained at the end of the previous film. She&#39;s clearly a prisoner of the Guardians as she is in handcuffs and doesn&#39;t look to be participating in the fight.</p>

<p>This Baby Groot&nbsp;is extremely cute. While not as good as the jacketed Groot in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76080-1/Ayesha-s-Revenge"">Ayesha&#39;s Revenge</a>&nbsp;I&#39;m really glad they were able to fit him in this set and it really adds some good value</p>

<p>Overall, as usual with the Marvel Super Heroes line the figures are the main attraction. Now onto the main build.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Set</strong></p>

<p>The Abilisk&nbsp;honestly doesn&#39;t look that great... Comparing the model to what we see in the trailer it doesn&#39;t look anything like that creature. It also uses a ton of stickers, which I chose to leave off as I plan to mainly use this element for parts. It can&#39;t fit a minifigure in it&#39;s mouth which limits it&#39;s play value. The tentacles can spin around and try to attack the characters, but the whole thing feels like an add on just to raise the price. I would much rather the parts budget be used to expand upon the Milano.</p>

<p>Speaking of which the Milano is immediately&nbsp;much smaller than the previous one.&nbsp;You can open up the cockpit, which is a nice exclusive print. You can fit the four standard minifigures in there with a little bit of fuss and baby Groot can just be thrown in on the side. Two bombs are hidden under each wing and can be activated discreetly by pushing down on the technic pin above. Two stud shooters are also on top of the ship to provide more firepower when taking on the Abilisk. Other than that the Milano is very plain. Some modifications to expand the fuselage&nbsp;are necessary to and I think over the ship is very small. I hate to continue to compare this set with the earlier model but the older one had much more room to pose up minifigures inside which this one lacks. This ship has a lot of potential and a long way to go until it will be as good as its&nbsp;predecessor.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Like most Marvel sets the minifigures are going to be a main draw. The set though is just not on the same level as other sets from this year have been. I&#39;m sure for children this will be pleasing and of course with some imagination I think the Abilisk could be ok. For everyone else, I think you should take this as a chance to really modify this ship like myself and make it something that you could really enjoy having on your shelf. I feel this should have been a $40 set and then I would say buy it, but a $50 I would wait for a sale. I think you should see the movie first and then consider this set. I would also have to recommend&nbsp;the other two sets in this line first but I don&#39;t think this one is as bad as people, myself included have made it out to be.</p>
