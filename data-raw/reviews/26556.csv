<p>The main things that appealed to me about this set were the range of windows and doors included (as I find I can never have enough), and the range of colours included.</p>

<p>As it turns out, the colour range also presents a minor drawback, as there are only a handful of parts included of each colour. This set is more for adding splashes of interesting colours and small details rather than constructing buildings with more than one wall.</p>

<p>That said, the most impressive aspect of this set for me was the sheer quantity of pieces included. When the contents are unpacked, the pile of parts looks like something you&#39;d expect from a set twice the cost from any other theme.</p>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;a good selection of new and relatively rare parts, including several in unusual colours.</p>
