<p>Blue!&nbsp; So much blue!&nbsp; It comes with classic blue, light blue, dark blue, and my very favorite azure blue (although only a total of six elements in azure).<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>These sets are clearly not a source of spectacular parts or building experiences, but as an introduction for a child to what you can build, and how you can build it with Lego blocks, this is an excellent starting point.</p>

<p>The instruction book guides you through the builds in order of difficulty, starting with a two-dimensional house, showing how to connect the bricks, use a long plate to anchor the structure in the middle, and how to overlap elements to strengthen the build.&nbsp; It includes a single bi-dimensional brick with studs both on top and on one side.&nbsp; To this you can attach the fun orange circle element.&nbsp; It&#39;s cute, it&#39;s a bit boring, but it&#39;s great for starters.</p>

<p>The second build is a whale, which is built with light blue and classic blue bricks, slopes, and bows, including a pair of sleepy eye tiles and a transparent water spout on top.&nbsp; Since it&#39;s built in three dimensions, the build is a bit more complicated than the house, and more satisfying to finish.</p>

<p>The third build is the train engine - a nice little build with six tiny wheels, and a nice use of trans bricks and specialized pieces to create the right silhouette with the minimum number of parts.</p>

<p>I was relieved that the set offered enough pieces to build exactly what was promised on the box -- after the frustration of the (free, but still!) unsatisfying Christmas advent-calendar-that-wasn&#39;t, I&#39;d been a bit fearful that this set would provide bricks to build and then unbuild things.&nbsp; Instead it gave the exactly right number of pieces to build all three, with a spare sleepy eye tile in addition.</p>

<p>The instruction book was also simple enough for a beginner to follow easily -- no more than one or two pieces added with most steps, and a maximum of four in the final build to create the nose piece of the train engine.</p>

<p>I recommend these sets to anyone offering the Lego world to a child who might otherwise not know where to start.</p>

<p>This is by far the best of the 4 small colour themed creative boxes as it has the most parts, a good selection of parts and well, it&#39;s blue.</p>

<p>The three models (which can all be made at once unlike the Creator 3-in-1) are cute and fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are no rare parts here and that is the appeal, but there are a few shades of blue, regardless, this is not a parts builder.</p>

<p>The instruction book is fun and features all three instructions, a little bio of the set designer and some inspiration.</p>

<p>Obviously kids will get the most out of this set but the inner child will love it too!</p>

<p>Please see my youtube for my build and impressions.</p>

<p>This is a cheap Lego Classic pack suitable for younger kids with some experience in Lego.</p>

<p>It is part of a 4 colour series, Blue, Red, Green and Yellow. (the colours of Lego) These sets are fun as they include all the parts to make each separate model at the same time (unlike Lego Creator)&nbsp;and if you buy different colour sets, there are some combined set instructions to expand the playability of these budget friendly sets.</p>

<p>The Blue pack contains a Whale, Train and a House.</p>

<p>They are relatively simple to build owing to the limitation of the number of bricks and a great way to get started with standard sized Lego.</p>

"ShawnMarie","2018-02-04T18:09:21.86Z","Perfect travel set, do not overlook these.","<p>My family bought all the color sets while on vacation at Rehoboth Beach on a rainy day.&nbsp; At $5 a pop with idea sheets they were a bargain compared to other toys at the beach and they spent a whole afternoon with them.</p>

<p>They are the perfect lego travel sets because they offer a great range of variety and if you lose a piece or two it isn&#39;t the end of a $60 set.</p>

<p>Many cool shapes and colors are included.&nbsp; Love, love, love these sets!</p>

True there&#39;s like three quarter of the set is blue (if you count the aqua blue) but you do get more colors with it. It come with quite a few non-basic bricks.&nbsp; i built all the sets, and it&#39;s quite obvious that the designers were going for &quot;cute&quot; this time.&nbsp; They all look very nice.&nbsp; The train rolls nicely.&nbsp; Too clear off my shelf i tried sticking a mini-fig into it, but it&nbsp; didn&#39;t fit.&nbsp; It was however able to lean out the back without looking too bad.&nbsp; Knowing that these are on sale a lot of place i would recommend picking it up if you have a need for some bricks of just want to start a gift for a young lego fan.</p>
