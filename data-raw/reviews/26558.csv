<p>Please see my youtube for my build and impressions.</p>

<p>This is a cheap Lego Classic pack suitable for younger kids with some experience in Lego.</p>

<p>It is part of a 4 colour series, Blue, Red, Green and Yellow. (the colours of Lego) These sets are fun as they include all the parts to make each separate model at the same time (unlike Lego Creator) and if you buy different colour sets, there are some combined set instructions to expand the playability of these budget friendly sets.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Red pack contains a Crab,&nbsp;Racing Car&nbsp;and a Windmill.</p>

<p>They are relatively simple to build owing to the limitation of the number of bricks and a great way to get started with standard sized Lego.</p>

<p>Lots of varied shapes, great idea sheet and quick builds make for the perfect travel set.&nbsp; If you lose a piece or two, you haven&#39;t ruined a $60 set.</p>

<p>Love, love, love these sets!</p>

"mafon2","2018-06-30T21:54:24.34Z","To scratch the itch","<p>I adore these little color-matched sets and got all 4 of them. My favorite is green, &#39;cause it has bite (crocodiles and castles!). But this isn&#39;t bad either &ndash; red pieces are always welcome. Especially slopes and <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-11211"">11211</a>.</p>

<p>It&#39;s the smallest of the sets with only 55 pieces, but color-wise it&#39;s the most appealing. Also it has quite rare eyes, according to Brickset, it&#39;s the only set with the crab eyes!</p>

<p>The builds look&nbsp;ok. I love the shape of the car and pincers of the crab, one of which is clutching a kelp or a 100 euros. The mill is just a source of pink bricks. It&#39;s blades are all the same, which drastically reduces the variability (you can&#39;t make wings!)</p>

<p>Still I found it pretty fancy to be rebuild.</p>

<p>But, honestly, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a reason to buy these boxes, but on a sale for spare change&nbsp;or as a small gift. Or if you really need a quick&nbsp;fix.</p>
