<p>Lots of piece and color variation here, fun builds with instructions and easy to come up with your own ideas.</p>

<p>Perfect travel set too, if you loose a piece or two you haven&#39;t ruined a $60 set.&nbsp; We keep ours in the car in ziploc bags.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-10-13T07:41:18.027Z","Simply not interesting to a 5 year old","<p>I was excited to see my son get this for his birthday, a set that requires and inspires creativity.&nbsp; Unfortunately, my son was not nearly as excited as me.&nbsp; He opened it, and that is when he lost interest.</p>

<p>Where I thought that this set my give you a handful of possible builds, the instructions only give the three builds depicted on the box, and it has exactly the required pieces for those three builds to be built together.&nbsp; Of course, those three builds don&#39;t really fit together too well, and aren&#39;t all that appealing to a pre-schooler when he has police cars, space ships, boats, and airplanes.</p>

<p>I guess the real downfall of this set is that it doesn&#39;t show your child all the possibilities that loose bricks can offer you, and doesn&#39;t really give you enough loose bricks to build something large.&nbsp; Of course the other shortcoming is the boringness of these bricks, the most exciting bricks are the two eyes, and there are no minifigures.</p>

<p>I really wish this set, instead of giving you instructions for 3 builds, gave you pictures of 50 builds without any instructions and challenged your kid to figure out how to build them on their own or come up with their own creations.</p>

<p>Although really, at the end of the day, without Batman or Storm Troopers or Police or..., how can this set ever compete with the other sets you own?&nbsp; I had bought my son a 900 brick Classic set I was saving for the holidays, I guess I may have to wait a few more years to give it to him.&nbsp; While he can build some pretty creative stuff if all he has is loose bricks, his Batman, Star Wars, and City sets are just way too much fun to play with that he doesn&#39;t really have time for creative building.</p>
