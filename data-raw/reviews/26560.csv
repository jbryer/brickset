<p>My family bought all 4 color sets for $5 each on a rainy vacation day in Rehoboth Beach.&nbsp; Way cheaper than a trip to the arcade and they kept my kids busy all afternoon while the rain passed.</p>

<p>Lots of variety in color and brick style plus a thoughtful idea book with plenty of room for your own designs.</p>

<p>These are the perfect travel sets, we keep them in the car in Ziplock bags.&nbsp; Enough variety to build with but if you lose a piece or two you haven&#39;t ruined a $60 set.</p>

"Minifig290","2019-01-11T20:38:21.647Z","Awesome Challenge Pack","<p>Hello all, previously in March 2018 I reviewed the 10401 Rainbow Fun which i titled the set &quot;Best &pound;5 Set Ever&quot; and to this day i still agree but im going to see if any other &pound;5 set can beat it, so for the first review I&#39;ll be looking at the 10709 Orange Creative Box that retails for &pound;/$4.99 having 60 parts giving it a Price Per Piece of 8.3p/c</p>

<p>Like the Rainbow Fun this set contains a instructions manual that unlike the Rainbow fun shows how to build three builds using all 60 parts. Lets take a look now.</p>

<p><strong>Builds</strong></p>

<p><b>Build 1.</b> The first build in the manual is a little shack or house front, it uses a 2x6 yellow plate as its base, has a 1x2x3 window and insert to represent a door. On the left of the door is a hollow window that has a plain minifigure head and flower top to show a pineapple. Finally the builds roof has 3 2x2 Orange roof pieces with a lactic piece and two 1x1 yellow bricks. This build is a meh build to be honest but I like the concept.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Build 2. </b>Now the second build is a terrifyingly cute lion build, using a 4x4 tan plate for his base. His body has a 2x3 orange brick with a few sloped parts for feet and a 1x2 plate with red stud for his tail. The lions Maine uses 4x sloped parts in orange while his face is attached onto a 1x2 red brick with studs on one side. Based on 2x2 plate the face has 2 1x1 round tile printed eyes a noes and some teeth. This build is definitely my favorite.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Build 3.</b> Like the Rainbow Fun set there is a plain build but this time its a bi-plain, Using a 2x6 plate in cool yellow and a 2x4 plate in orangey yellow for its base it has a set of wheels pre-attatched onto a axis. At the front is a 2x2 transparent sloped brick and a propellor. At the back is a 1x2 sloped brick plus a few other parts for some detail. Sadly this build was quite lame and comparing it to the plain in the Rainbow Fun makes this build look like garbage.</p>

<p><strong>Build 4. </strong>Like the Rainbow Fun, this set&#39;s manual has design ideas to inspire creativity and let the builder build what ever they can with the 60 pieces included but also has some combinations with the 10706-10708 sets that are also &pound;5 each.</p>

<p><b>Parts&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Having 60 parts there are a few gems in this set, now most of the sets parts come in different shades of yellow and orange with a few other colours mixed in. Here are 6 of the notable parts in this small set.</p>

<p>1. 2x6 Plate in cool yellow (Only released in 7 sets) (Quantity 3)</p>

<p>2. Plain yellow minifigure head (Quantity 1)</p>

<p>3. Green flower 1x1 plate (Quantity 1, plus extra)</p>

<p>4. 1x1 white tooth pieces (Quantity 2)</p>

<p>5. 1x1 Round white eye printed tiles (Quantity 2, plus extra)</p>

<p>6. 1x2 cool yellow bricks (Quantity 2)</p>

<p>Alongside these there are many other plates, bricks etc.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Now like the Rainbow Fun set i love the creativity that this set inspires its builder to use, most of the people who get this set will be kids and they will appreciate this type of set more than an AFOL or TFOL, myself though I love these creativity boxes but the parts in this one just were not as amazing as the parts in the Rainbow Fun although the cool yellow pieces where great to have. So the Rainbows Fun title as &quot;Best &pound;5 Set Ever&quot; remains at this moment in time.</p>

<p>This set will definitely be a set i&#39;d recommend to young builders or for a cheap little pocket money pick up at your local toy store or supermarkets, though sadly this set has recently retired but a few shops will stiff have this set available.</p>

<p><b>Pros -</b> Love the lions build, nice inclusion of cool yellow parts, great to get a plain minifigure head in a small set, inspires imagination.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons - </strong>Sadly the bi-plain build failed to excite</p>
