<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>- New Mr. Freeze! I realize we are getting another new one with LEGO Batman Movie, but this one resembles the Animated Series quite well (outside of the scuba gear). The dark bley and blue coloring on the torso look great! The lavender hands are interesting and seems to be the only distracter in my opinion.</p>

<p>- Nice transparent light blue pieces. My daughter loves the gems and the ice wall can be put to good use elsewhere.</p>

<p>- The Batman symbol discs are fun and can also be used elsewhere, like the Bat-signal in the new polybag. You can make your own!</p>

<p>- The shooter works quite well, although avoid the eyes!</p>

<p>- I rather like the new Bat tail wings on the boat, although I am not sure if I will be able to effectively reuse them in a MOC.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- Being a Juniors set, nothing amazing in terms of build technique or piece usage.</p>

<p>- To further the above point, the giant boat hull. This may be useful for a MOC and it does work for a Batboat, but it stands out against the rest of Batman&#39;s vehicles.</p>

<p>- The same Batman figure seen many times over.</p>

<p>- Higher price for lower piece count, but this is the trend with the Juniors theme.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>I highly recommend it if you are interested in another Freeze figure that resembles other incarnations of him. The price is high, but I still splurged. Maybe wait for a sale? I have seen just Mr. Freeze going for almost $11 online, so at $15 for the whole set, it is worth it.</p>
