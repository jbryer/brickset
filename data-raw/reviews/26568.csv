<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This Mercedes-AMG set shows off this growth perfectly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Packaging/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box looks great with the glossier finish compared to normal boxes and the carbon fiber texture that&#39;s par for the course in the Speed Champions line. The theme logo is now gold instead of light blue, which really makes the packaging pop. The box depicts the racecar in a fancy garage and shows off the alternate front bumper.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions don&#39;t distinguish between dark gray and light gray very well, something which has plagued many sets in recent years. This is especially a pain considering the car&#39;s predominantly dark gray color scheme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing that the Speed Champions line excels at is building techniques. Set designer <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/cforcraigcforcallum/"">Craig Callum</a> is terrific when capturing the shapes of each car with LEGO bricks, using ridiculous amounts of different SNOT techniques to round out the outer edges of each vehicle. The front bumper showcases this perfectly, using SNOT bricks with different offsets to ensure that the cheese slope headlights line up with the radiator bow smoothly. While not as elegantly crafted, the rear bumper also does as good of a rendition of the car&#39;s shape as can be done with bricks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As mentioned in the title, this set has many stickers, as do most Speed Champions sets. The stickers are printed on a clear background, so while they look great against the bricks, it can cause trouble if dirt, crumbs, or shreds of paper get stuck to the sticker.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Finished Product</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once completed, the vehicle looks amazing. The yellow highlights really pop against the dark gray and the yellow rims look great. The car&#39;s long silhouette has been captured excellently and the racing wing and splitter give it an almost threatening appearance. The rear wing can be removed and the front bumper can easily be swapped out for the alternate bumper, allowing the car to be changed into its street trim. Both versions look awesome, although the race trim has an edge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigure also deserves special attention. While minifigures in other Speed Champions sets have been rather lackluster in my opinion, this one stands out. The black and yellow racing suit looks great, although the yellow stripes printed on the torso and legs appear a little diluted, most likely due to the black background. The racing suit&#39;s color scheme and the driver&#39;s courageous expression give the minifigure a bold, almost heroic appearance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the fifth Speed Champions set in my collection, this one is easily my favorite so far. The detail on the minifigure and the car as well as the excellent color scheme make this a must-have for any Lego car collector.</p>

<p>Having been pleasantly surprised by the <strong>set 75885 Ford Fiesta M-Sport WRC</strong>, when I saw two other Speed Champion sets on sale I picked them up. This Mercedes-AMG GT3 car was one of them.Though not the complete sticker fest that was the Ford Fiesta, there are still 26 stickers included in this set. Though some of them are small, they are pretty easy to apply. By itself, the build was quite easy, but enjoyable. The finished product definitely looks like a racing car, with two options for the nose of the vehicle. Overall, I like this set, and it makes for a nice car to drive around. If you like racing cars, this car is well worth picking up.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>I took my time building the car, first putting the stickers on all the appropriate pieces, then put the car together. With some Glassex (Windex) and patience I think it turned out fine. That said, the application of two stickers (the ones with the Mercedes star applied to the front) was a little tricky; any mistake in their alignment is immediately extremely visible. Lining up the stickers for the sidewall/doors was much easier. Note that these stickers are of the clear background variety, so finger prints will show up easily.&nbsp;The building techniques were nice, though IMHO there was little that surprised me. I liked the design of the head-lights construction.</p>

<p>Overall it took me about an hour. My guess is most people will finish this set much quicker. The given age range is 7 to 14 years old. If adults apply the stickers, then most 7 or 6 year olds should be able to build this car.</p>

<h2>The minifigure</h2>

<p>There was one minifigure included in this set. The design of the print is nice (and fits well with that of the vehicle. Unfortunately the black background does bleed through the yellow stripes on the torso (front and back) and legs. The face print is nice, and reminiscent of that of the WRC car driver. Only one face print is provided, and the driver is equipped with a wrench, which can be used to push loose the hub caps in the wheels.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>I like the overall looks of the car, and thing the designers have done a very credible job catching its appearance. The replaceable nose is well integrated, and when pushed in properly, there is little to suggest that it is detachable. Both options (presumably low and high downforce) look good. The stickers add much to the overall look.. The designer has done a credible job recreating the rear lights and the vertical stands for the rear wing. What I like as well is the way the designers have been able to cover up odd (e.g. bright red) pieces with the proper grey, black and yellow.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>To me this is a 50/50 play vs display model. The car handles easily, and should be good fun racing around. It is also a nice little display model. The stickers will keep better if used for display rather than play, of course.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this is a good set, and a nice addition to any collection of cars. It is IMHO also a nice play set and could work well as a gift - even without the stickers. And even at RRP I think it offers good value for money.</p>

"Duq","2018-09-01T10:01:54.053Z","Looks better in the flesh","<p>This member of the Speed Champions family wasn&#39;t on my wanted list; I&#39;m not a big Merc&nbsp;fan and the thing just looked a bit grey&nbsp;and boring. I ended up buying&nbsp;it on impulse.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts selection is the usual fare for Speed Champions; a vehicle base, some plates and brackets and a lot of tiles and curved slopes. Most parts are grey and black, with a few yellow pieces for accents. No unique parts although the wheels in yellow only appear in one other set, the weird Garmadon&nbsp;shark from the Ninjago movie.</p>

<h3>Minifig</h3>

<p>There is one minifig in the set and his torso and legs are unique to this set, with a Mercedes star on the front of the torso and the AMG logo on the back. In my copy of the set the yellow printing looks nothing like the image on the box. The yellow ink is so thin it looks almost green on the black background.</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>Like the parts selection the build is very much like other Speed Champions sets. A core with brackets built on a vehicle frame and front, sides and rear attached sideways. I must mention the tail lights though; the angled red tiles are a clever solution.</p>

<p>The most frustrating part of the build were the stickers. There are 26 of them, and they are transparent. It could be because of my not-so-young eyes but I found it difficult to put them on straight. Like the print on the body of the minifig&nbsp;the stickers suffer from light colour on a dark background and as a result the yellow of the stickers looks nothing like the yellow of the wheels and rear wing.</p>

<h3>The model</h3>

<p>Looking at the picture on the box I thought the bonnet was way too long but it turns out the proportions are surprisingly close to the original. The overall shape of the car is nice although the front is not exactly subtle.</p>

<p>This car has two options for the front that can easily be swapped out, a bit like the Ford Fiesta rally car. While this adds play value it does little for the set as a display model. Unless of course you end up buying two to show both options...</p>

<h3>The verdict</h3>

<p>At nearly 200 parts for &euro;15 it&#39;s good value. It&#39;s got some play value and it actually looks pretty good which is why despite the build and parts selection being unspectacular, I&#39;ve given this set a 4 out of 5 overall.</p>

"Elv1s","2018-08-02T03:45:20.56Z","Great for the car fans!","<p>Ok, so I like cars, like A LOT, so this it automatically an amazing set for me. This was my first Speed Chamions theme set, and introduced me to one of my favorite LEGO themes, I now have 8 sets and I love each and every one of them. If your child likes cars, get them this set, or I guess any Speed Champions set will do.</p>
