The build was easy and I keep the car on display on my work desk. This was great until a co worker pointed out that it really wasn&#39;t a completed set until I had both the #5 and the #7 so of course I had to buy another! Regardless really enjoy having these!</p>

"TheCahleySlash","2017-08-09T16:18:13.02Z","A must have for fans!","<p>You can&#39;t go wrong on this set, the design and build is superb value for money. I bought my set on a large reduction and in my opinion even for the retail price it&#39;s good pricing especially for a licensed set. The car itself if enjoyable to have for play or display purposes.</p>

<p>I liked that the set included an interchangeable driver number&nbsp;plate&nbsp;for the two drivers of the 2016 Ferrari season, which is a welcome addition. The inclusion of the checkered flag is quite cute in my opinion along with the miniature pit lane which is great for casual fans or for children to replicate a race experience.</p>

<p>The figure&nbsp;in the set captures the 2016 Ferrari drivers clothing fairly well, but some additional&nbsp;arm printing would have been welcomed to add to authenticity. The head piece is your standard head piece, would be nice if Lego released actual&nbsp;driver figures, like they did&nbsp;under the old Racers theme.</p>

<p>Criticisms about this set would be the car rims, if you notice the Mercedes pit stop set, the cars there featured&nbsp;detailed alloys, I feel this should have been included in this set also. Stickers are always going to be a problem especially as some stickers here are one stud by stud in size, it could be difficult to apply for some builders.</p>

<p>Overall if your a fan of Ferrari, Formula One or even toy cars, it&#39;s a must have for any fan!</p>

"CarolinaOnMyMind","2019-01-03T22:11:54.88Z","Sticker Aficionados Rejoice!","<p>First off, a disclaimer: This is my first Speed Champions build. I&#39;m not a car guy at all.&nbsp;I can tell you nothing about its included or omitted details, the accuracy of the model or how this stacks up to other Speed Champions sets. The only thing I know is&nbsp;that I think the F1 Ferrari looks cool and I liked the size and scale of it. So I bought it.</p>

<p>And while I&#39;ll tell you that my overall satisfaction with this set is quite high, my review will focus primarily on one thing: stickers.</p>

<p>I often hear people complain about stickers instead of printed parts in various sets, but&nbsp;I always said I don&#39;t mind stickers. They usually add some interesting detail and it&#39;s honestly not that hard. All you need is&nbsp;some tweezers and a steady hand&mdash;no problem.&nbsp;I&#39;d even say I <em>enjoy</em> putting them on. Heck, I&#39;m even the official &quot;Sticker Putter Onner&quot; at my house as my kids come to me to place the stickers on their sets when they are building something (because &quot;Daddy does it just right&quot;).</p>

<p>However, after building this set, I think I&#39;m done. I&#39;d built some other things which I considered to have lots of stickers, but this was a completely. different. level. This set is only 184 total pieces, and yet, it has 31 stickers! Thirty-friggin&#39;-one! That&#39;s a sticker to part ratio of 1:6, which is ridiculous. Actually, I was building this at the same time my daughter was building a larger Elves set (I was putting her stickers on too). That set (41196) has 884 pieces and only 18 stickers. That&#39;s a sticker to part ratio of 1:49. The truth is that 31 stickers for a set this size is just way too many. It honestly felt like you were putting a sticker on after every two bricks (which actually isn&#39;t far off). And many of them were on small, little 1x1 tiles or cheese slope pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All that being said, the finished model looks great to my eyes. It&#39;s a cool car at a great scale, rolls well and I&#39;m overall very happy with it. I&#39;m just not sure it was worth the sticker effort. I also don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever choose to do it again if I had to, which kind of makes me sad. I do have two other Speed Champions sets on the shelf already, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll be too keen to open and build them if their sticker ratio is anywhere close to this one.</p>

<p>Would I recommend this set? Sure. If you like stickers. If you&#39;re going to build this set, you better.</p>

"KX","2018-01-03T14:14:49.623Z","Forza Ferrari?","<p>This is my 2nd Speed Champions set and I&rsquo;m a fan of this F1 team.&nbsp; How did it go?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PARTS</strong></p>

<p>Like most Speed Champions sets, there were some parts that don&rsquo;t truly belong due to the color selection.&nbsp; This set had some blue pieces that are useful in the build but are not hidden properly.&nbsp; If you view the finished model from the top, the blue pegs near the sidepods are quite obvious.&nbsp; While considered as a minor issue, some builders (like me) may feel that it is a bit off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BUILDING EXPERIENCE</strong></p>

<p>Fun and interesting build.&nbsp; However, if you&rsquo;re an F1 fan, the scaling of the vehicle is off; the cockpit and the engine cover is placed too far.&nbsp; It is understandable because the flowing nature of F1 cars are not easily recreated in Lego.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not perfect but with all the limitations of this model, this would do.</p>

<p>Stickers? Yep. Lots of them.&nbsp; If you hate 1x1 stickers, then you&rsquo;ll hate them more here. Still, the final product looks nice after a long careful process of &quot;stickering&quot;. So yeah, it&#39;s worth the pain and frustration :D</p>

<p>The side build is small but it&rsquo;s definitely better. &nbsp;(Compared to those side builds we&rsquo;ve got on previous sets.)&nbsp; Not that exciting but it&rsquo;s a wonderful addition whether for display purposes or for play.</p>

<p>The minifig was not too special.&nbsp; The body was exclusive and excellent but the face is bland.&nbsp; You cannot recreate the drivers (i.e. Vettel or Raikkonen) as much as we would&rsquo;ve liked but they did provide us with some (plain) helmets and changeable numbers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>VALUE FOR MONEY</strong></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re both a Ferrari and Lego fan, this set is superb.&nbsp; Still, because of the Ferrari brand, this set is quite pricey.&nbsp; Get this set when a discount is present.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL</strong></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great small set for F1 fans (particularly Ferrari fans). Still, the competition for merchandise like this is hard.&nbsp; A 1:18 or 1:14 diecast model with a driver that&rsquo;s recognizable will sell better than this one.&nbsp; This is where, in my opinion, this set failed to deliver.&nbsp; There was a time Lego gave us a Ferrari set, 8168 &ndash; Ferrari Victory, that is far superior than this one.&nbsp; Recognizable helmets, numbers, faces, etc. with nearly the same number of pieces.&nbsp; It may have looked simple, but it was a hit for the tifosi.</p>

<p>Would I recommend you buying this one? If you&rsquo;re a fan, yes and no. Yes, because it&#39;s a fun merch to build. No, because of the blandness of it.</p>

<p>But for casual Lego fans? You won&rsquo;t miss out too much.&nbsp; A City, Ninjago or SW set can easily beat this one.</p>

"gdr36","2020-05-18T19:58:13.917Z","Nice Set of an Insignificant Car","<p>Overview: This set was released in 2017 for 15 USD and has 184 pieces and one minifig. I got it on Ebay recently to add another F1 car to my Speed Champions collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: Nothing special. There is a printed checkered flag which is nice since all the sets I own include&nbsp;stickers for the flags. A crazy number of stickers are included, but are relatively easy to apply and add to the look of the car so I do not hate them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifig: This can represent&nbsp;either Kimi Raikkonen or Sebastian Vettel depending on which helmet color&nbsp;you choose. I chose the black helmet for Raikkonen since I am a fan of his. I like the torso of the figure with the Shell, UPS and Santander logos on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: It took about a half hour to build because of the stickers. Some SNOT is used for the side with technic pins and I like how the nose slots on to the bodywork using a 2L technic axle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model: This is impressively accurate to the real SF16-H considering how small it is. One of the main problems is that the cockpit was mounted too far back, but that is okay since a figure needs to fit and it couldn&#39;t have without this compromise. Some blue technic pins are exposed on the inside of the cockpit, but this isn&#39;t a problem if you display the car with the figure inside it. My favorite part of the car is that there are 2 tiles included, one with the number 5, the other with 7, so you can pick the number that corresponds with your preferred driver. But the one thing that bothers me isn&#39;t about the model itself but the real thing. 2016 was a&nbsp;terrible year for Ferrari, going winless and having one of their worst seasons in a while. I know that LEGO probably started making this set before the season ended, but I just wish they hadn&#39;t made the model of the 2016 Ferrari. That aside, though, I think this is a great representation of the real car.</p>

<p>Side build: This is one of the most substantial side builds in a single car set, with a bit of wall with a checkered flag and inaccurate starting lights. On the other side of the wall there is space for the wrench and walkie-talkie along with a computer showing a map of the circuit, which doesn&#39;t resemble any real ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Verdict: A good set of a mediocre car. I&#39;m sure most people don&#39;t care about that and just think it looks cool, but that bugs me a bit. Otherwise, a nice looking and decently accurate model, a large-ish side build, and a cool figure. A good $15 package while it was out. Now, if you want it you&#39;ll have to pay $10-15 more than retail, but it&#39;s worth it if you&#39;re an F1 fan or just want to add an awesome looking Ferrari to your collection.&nbsp;</p>
