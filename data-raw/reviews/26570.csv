I thought the cars rather bulky and ludicrously oversized compared to the accompanying minifigures. Had it not been for the allure of the GT40 I would, in all probability, have continued down that path and been all the poorer for it.</p>

<p><em>This is truly a most excellent set.</em></p>

<h2>Packaging</h2>

<p>The box is mid-sized, featuring a good selection of photographs of the cars from a variety of angles, as well as a real-life photograph of each of the cars. Contained are two instruction manuals, one for each car, two numbered plastic bags, ditto, and a large sticker sheet. Nothing surprising but the photos of the models real world equivalents is a nice touch.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>Three minifigures are included in the set. A race official with torso printed on both sides. A 2016 GT driver with also with torso printed on both sides as well as printed legs. And finally, a 1966 driver with&nbsp;torso printed on both sides. Both drivers are unique this set.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>What surprised me during the build was how different each car felt. Given the basic premise of four wheels, SNOT sides and bumpers, and a minifigure size cockpit I&rsquo;d expected the builds to be much more similar than they were. More to the point, the builds could have been much more similar. That they are not would seem to be a conscious design choice. If so, much kudos to the design team.</p>

<p>Having bought the set for the GT40 I naturally started with the GT. It&rsquo;s done up in a lively, and LEGO friendly, livery of red, white, and blue, accentuated with some black. I&rsquo;ll freely admit a certain nostalgia the predominant colours of my youth. The build is fairly straightforward but there are lots of small details that are cleverly thought out. Of particular note is the curvature towards the rear of the car past the cockpit and the wings, for lack of a better word, connecting the roof to the air intakes. This car uses the only printed piece in the set, the oversized windscreen with Ford printed on it. The model looks good, if slightly angular, without the stickers. It looks great with them. Especially the two large stickers on the side are needed as they provide the white transition from front to rear. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The GT40 is done up in black and grey. Mostly black. Initially I was slightly disappointed they didn&rsquo;t go for the light blue/orange scheme sponsored by Gulf but upon consideration I&rsquo;m rather happy they didn&rsquo;t. The sombre black/grey scheme, even if less recognisable, just seems to suit the car. As with the GT the construction is straightforward in the main. Unlike the GT the part that&rsquo;s not straightforward, albeit it is both straight and forward, is pure genius. The 11 bricks making up the front snaps into place on hinges and rotates into a perfect fit with the sloping hood. This is LEGO at its finest, using well known bricks to create a completely new effect. It is nothing short of an epiphany.</p>

<p>One slight downside to the colour scheme is that the model really needs the stickers to shine. That being said, the stickers are quite subdued and not that hard to place correctly although care should be taken to line them up as straight as possible.Once the stickers have been placed the model looks absolutely gorgeous.</p>

<p>The GT40 bag also includes a simple victory podium and the trophy. Not by any margin an interesting build, but it does undoubtedly increase the already substantial play value of the set.</p>

<h2>The finished models</h2>

<p>It&rsquo;s when contemplating the set as a whole, one realizes what a modern classic it is. Each car in itself is a great, given the limitations posed by its medium and size, reproduction of its real-life counterpart. The GT40 more so than the GT, but the GT in no way feels like an afterthought. It&rsquo;s just a harder car to model faithfully in LEGO at this scale (and the GT40 is so very, very cleverly done). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When viewed side by side, however, the cars take on a whole new dimension as the five decades separating them becomes apparent. These are no longer just two cars, they are an illustration of half a century of automotive engineering. Each capturing the Zeitgeist of its time, transcending their toy nature to become something much more.</p>

<p>(I might be putting it on a bit tick, but they <em>do</em> look much better taken together than on their own).</p>

The experience buiding both cars was very good, but special mention must be made of the 1966 Ford GT40. The older car uses clever build mechanics to achieve curves and sharp corners that are very true to the original. Neither car is especially complicated, but they are detailed in all&nbsp;the right ways.</p>

<p>It&#39;s especially nice seeing the two cars standing next to one another. The decision to showcase two years of the same model vehicle was an excellent touch; the two cars are naturally similar in design, but the contrast between the two is truly spectacular. The bright, colorful modern version looks wildly different than its older forerunner, but you can see just enough of the older car&#39;s DNA to see how closely related they are.</p>

<p>Overall this was a great set. A great selection of vehicles, a satisfying build experience, and decent value for the money spent.</p>
