There are pretty much no play features, which is disappoiting, and i love that they parodied the Arnold Schwarzenegger version of Mr. Freeze in Batman and Robin!</p>

<p>Overall, a nice cheap set for starting TLBM collecters, But it could use some features.</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri"">THE <st2:stockticker w:st=""on"">BOX</st2:stockticker><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri;font-weight:normal;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"">As local stores are catching up in inventory, 2017 sets are already starting to hit the shelves, and LEGO stores. This recent addition comes in the form of 70901 Mr. Freeze Ice Attack. At 201 Pieces, it&#39;s currently the smallest of the available sets. How does it hold up, hoping to set the stage for the upcoming film? Let&#39;s find out!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri;font-weight:normal;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"">First, we have the box art. The front of the box depicts a battle scene in a factory of sorts. The Batman Movie logo is pretty snazzy, and subtly busy, on the upper left. There are three characters included; Batman, Security Guard, and <st2:personname w:st=""on""><st1:title w:st=""on"">Mr.</st1:title> <st1:sn w:st=""on"">Freeze</st1:sn></st2:personname>. [img]https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5561/31204407932_ee2286ecfb.jpg[/img]</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri;font-weight:normal;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"">The back of the box contains more action, with <st1:title w:st=""on"">Mr.</st1:title> <st1:sn w:st=""on"">Freeze</st1:sn> being placed into his mech, Batman enjoying a Save-the-Day beverage, SG being trapped, and the shooting feature of <st2:personname w:st=""on""><st1:title w:st=""on"">Mr.</st1:title> <st1:sn w:st=""on"">Freeze</st1:sn></st2:personname>&#39;s cold cannon (which falls far from being the coolest thing about this set). [img]https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5791/31204408362_8cd1c838a7.jpg[/img]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri;font-weight:normal;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"">The underside of the box contains standard LEGO Legal, but also hints at a new range for LEGO Digital, called LEGO Life. Upon checking the link [<a href=""https://www.lego.com/en-us/life"">LEGO.com/life</a>], you are directed to a whimsical page geared towards [younger] fans. Yes, I&#39;ll still download it and probably use it frequently. The LEGO Life App promo is currently exclusive to the <st2:country-region w:st=""on"">UK</st2:country-region>, but shows a 2017 target release for the <st2:country-region w:st=""on"">U.S.</st2:country-region> and parts of <st2:place w:st=""on"">Northern Europe</st2:place>. More information can be found at <a href=""https://www.lego.com/en-us/life"">LEGO.com/life</a>. </span>[img]https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5817/30540906673_bd07e979aa.jpg[/img]<span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri;font-weight:normal;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold""><o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri;font-weight:normal;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"">On with the contents! I&#39;d love to think my box wasn&#39;t an exception. Even though the instructions and [tiny] sticker sheet were loose-in-box, they present themselves as though they were sealed with a backer. The dimensions of the instruction booklet are more book-ish, with the staples being along what we see as the top, so when turned sideways, it holds in your hands like a small book - without the long overflaps of days past. It&#39;s also similar to the box size. The 76 pages measure [as we see the image] just shy of 5&quot; Tall and 6 5/8&quot; Long. Held in the same orientation, the box internally measures a shy 5 &frac12;&quot; Tall and 10 1/8&quot; Long. With two bags of parts as padding, there really wasn&#39;t much room for movement, and running the spine with the length of the box prevented curl under shifting bags.

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri"">NEW PARTS<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri;font-weight:normal;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"">Before we move on to parts, allow me to break a barrier. There are a lot of new sets out, and we all want something exciting. Facing the obvious new elements and recolours within the <st2:stockticker w:st=""on"">CITY</st2:stockticker> theme, part of me turned and picked up this set because of the Medium Blues, and <st2:personname w:st=""on""><st1:title w:st=""on"">Mr.</st1:title> <st1:sn w:st=""on"">Freeze</st1:sn></st2:personname>&#39;s head. A bigger part of me, was highly intrigued as to the fin shapes seen below the Mech Torso, and above the hips. I just couldn&#39;t figure it out. Make it through the jargon and number details, and your patience will be rewarded, I promise. This set is a relative goldmine for new elements and recolours!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri;font-weight:normal;
mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"">In BAG 1 you will find a wide assortment. Starting in the lower left, and moving counterclockwise:[img]https://c6.staticflickr.com/6/5528/30540904653_711c5809a0.jpg[/img]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

This is yet another great indicator of the lengthy process, and previous knowledge, the LEGO Designers go through to prepare sets for the public. Whether or not it was designed specifically for this set, this element has had a lot of thought put into it, and was created to meet specifications we aren&#39;t even aware of. ***&nbsp; I don&#39;t even know where to begin the dimensions of this part, but take a listen to the key details.</p>

<p style=""margin-left:1in;"">The top runs flush left to right for a standard 2x4 rectangle, but runs &frac12; thicker on the front.

mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"">Batman has a muscular front torso, and definably printed back. He&#39;s also got a Utility Belt! The Security Guard also features a printed front and back. While not excessively detailed, I think the simple line around the collar, and slight sectioning of the leather belt are quite nice little details. Both characters feature dual printed faces. The guard has a stern &quot;I&#39;m Guarding&quot; face, and a &quot;I&#39;m froooooooozen!&quot; face. Both sides have a brilliant moustache printed.&nbsp;<o:p></o:p></span></p>

In a shift away from the newer Batman sets, his cowl has moved back to tall and pointy, as was standard for The LEGO Movie. His cape is the soft, cottony fabric, instead of the more crisp canvas-like material.

Neither of them is specific to Batman, and would look great in any industrial setting. As a word of caution, the 2x2 Round Tile used for the pressure gauge has the cross pattern in back, NOT the circle. While it&#39;s a tight fit for fingers, the best sticker application comes AFTER ensuring the tile is squarely in place, giving bearing on true top/bottom. As many have stated previously, the new elbow tubes work wonders for enhancing industrial settings, and they really give some fresh perspective to this tiny diorama. Curiously, on the back edge of the main wall, you will place a Brick, Modified 1 x 2 with Vertical Clip. It serves no direct purpose within this single set, and doesn&#39;t stand in the way of any moving components, but it does serve to expand a battle scene from other sets from the movie.

Sorry <st1:sn w:st=""on"">Arnold</st1:sn>, not you. The accordion type ridges on his body armor, as well as some facial elements, are reminiscent to the character from Batman the Animated Series. However, I most particularly enjoy the individual monocle style lenses over his eyes, opposed to the goggles or sunken in appearance. His printed torso and legs are also top notch! With multiple colors of Blues, Silvers, White, and details such as hoses, a waist belt, knee pads, and boot patterns on the toes. Once the shoulder pads are in place, and the head properly on, a top-down view will show two rings that form a nice little gap that snugly grabs onto the Trans-Clear dome for his helmet. He comes with a giant freeze cannon, that contains all types of attachments. While <st2:personname w:st=""on""><st1:title w:st=""on"">Mr.</st1:title> <st1:sn w:st=""on"">Freeze</st1:sn></st2:personname> is able to us the weapon as a standing assistant, it&#39;s much better suited to his Mech.[img]https://c5.staticflickr.com/6/5545/31204417412_bc1267881a.jpg[/img] [img]https://c1.staticflickr.com/6/5520/31204417672_022fc4129d.jpg[/img] [img]https://c7.staticflickr.com/6/5776/31204417862_0d651f5007.jpg[/img] [img]https://c3.staticflickr.com/6/5832/31204418082_b6eb3ca188.jpg[/img]<o:p></o:p></span></p>

normal"">THE MECH<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri;font-weight:normal"">The Mech Body is complex, in the simple kind of<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp; </span>way. Functional may be a better word. There are a massive 17 points of articulation[!!], and 11 of those have 360 capability. (An honest 9 if you don&#39;t count the Pin and Ball socket in the wrist, twice. The friction of the socket is greater than that of the pin, so while the hand can completely rotate, the ball joint in the wrist won&#39;t achieve any rotational movement, just the pin connection. A spare ball on the hip connection would allow for an 18/12 ratio, should you care to add provisional accoutrements to his rear.

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Calibri;font-weight:normal"">One thing I started doing with Mixels was to search how well they balanced in odd forms. With all the articulating points, it takes time, but you&#39;re not limited to simple poses. The &quot;Monkey Dance&quot; is always a good basis for extensive movement, but you can also get him to kneel. Notice you don&#39;t have to have his knee touch [nor will it] to make him balance in this manner. His arms and legs are a little bare, but its certainly nothing that would deter me from picking up the set.

The LEGO Batman Movie uses a yellow colour which complements the original LEGO Movie box design quite nicely, which originally was blue if memory serves. The logo stands out sharply in black drawing the eye and the images showcasing the set are very well executed.</span></span></span></span></p>

There are basic parts that are decent enough, but then you&rsquo;ve got some fun new elements such as the new macaroni piece and Mr. Freeze&rsquo;s battle armour torso piece, which was also introduced in the NEXO Knights theme this year.

The new utility belt piece is just icing on the cake, after years LEGO decided to make a new piece, time will tell if they start including it in regular DC Super Hero sets though.</span></span></span></span></p>

Mr. Freeze is no exception. He includes a lot of printed detailing for his armour with dual-sided torso printing and printing on the legs with pads and armour boots. His shoulder piece is new and attaches a dome piece over it harking back to the BtAS era fishbowl of Mr. Freeze compared to the more modern looking versions. His torso looks good enough for some extra army building for fans of the Galactic Minifigures in CMF.</span></span></span></span></p>

There&rsquo;s also an ice prison for the Security Guard. This is a pretty simple build, very fast too, compared to other sets in this price point in other Themes I fear The LEGO Batman movie sets will not meet expectations for builds. Mostly due to the small nature of the models being built, compared to larger sets this build is somewhat lacking.</span></span></span></span></p>

This feels more solid compared to the Gotham Power Plant section. Building large armour suits are always more fun than simple set pieces that are too small for their own good. A short and simple build too very fast, both bags feature builds that are fairly simpler than sets in other Themes, not juniorized, but definitely less involved than other Themes.</span></span></span></span></p>

Honestly it&rsquo;s the best model in the set for me and I could definitely leave the rest of the parts for something better suited than what we&rsquo;ve got. All of the baby blue parts and the overall design of this thing just impresses.</span></span></span></span></p>

Aside from the new macaroni parts there is very little value to be had from this model. You can&rsquo;t do anything with it, there are no exploding elements, no play features of any kind and the thing is the true definition of fa&ccedil;ade. The LEGO Designers should have done more than this, the jewelry store in the Catwoman set was at least a fully functional element that could be interacted with and had a bit of play value to it. Unless you buy all three of the small sets that combine the Gotham Plant together you are not getting the most for your dollar here.</span></span></span></span></p>

In fact why didn&rsquo;t they build a slightly larger interior build that incorporated the ice cell using the new ice prison parts from Legends of Chima? You could then have the security guard manning his post only to be suddenly trapped behind a wall of ice, and perhaps had some kind of blow-apart function. Really poor choices in execution here LEGO.</span></span></span></span></p>

As a stand-alone model on its own it definitely is lacking, even with the printed pieces. I find the sets in this price-range are slightly weaker compared to The LEGO Movie sets that were released at this price point. Which is a bit of a shame, however this does offer more to do than the lowest price-point set in the wave.</span></span></span></span></p>

"8BrickMario","2017-02-06T02:05:20.983Z","...darn it, Schwarzenegger took all the ice puns already.","<p>This set was one I went back and forth on. When I was offered a squished-box copy for 10% off, I decided to get it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Lots of blues, greys, and some sand green, too. The ice pieces might also be desirable. The mech has some new robot fists with a stud/Technic pin attachment point, and they can hold bar-shaped pieces.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Batman- This is the standard LBM Batman, but his faces (overly angry and concentrating and cocky and confident) are both great and very &quot;TLM Batman&quot;. His new utility belt is nice, and he comes with the grappling gun, here used as a flamethrower.</p>

<p>Guard- A basic civilian in peril, who has a nice uniform with air tanks and a helmet usually used for firefighters. He has two nice faces- frustrated and terrified. He has an ACU gun extended by binoculars.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeze- The star of the set, and very welcome. He has a new armor piece that allows him to finally have his classic domed helmet, as it provides an adapter for the classic dome piece. I might have changed the color of the armor to something other than light blue, though. as his head blends into it. Speaking of the head, he has a new take on his classic red goggles, as they&#39;re separate eyepieces here. He has appropriately-unhealthy cheekbones and wears a disparaging expression. The armor, as stated, makes this too much blue, so maybe they could have made his skin white instead? Either solution would work for me. Combining the body pieces with the upcoming&nbsp;Juniors Freeze head might be the solution for a more classic look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Underneath, his torso is nicely printed with his cryogenic suit, with metallic silver plating and tubing, and some joint details, plus some blue accents. My favorite detail is the ice seeping out from under the chestplate. Considering the detal on the other figures in this range, I&#39;m slightly disappointed by the lack of arm and side-leg printing.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>First to be built is a hinged ice prison for the guard, but it doesn&#39;t close easily around him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of many sections of Gotham Energy features as a setpiece, but besides the coffee cup and lever, there&#39;s really nothing to be done with it- there&#39;s not even any posing room.</p>

<p>Freeze&#39;s mech is the bulk of the set, and it&#39;s a great model. The body uses a new mech-frame piece, and and the limbs are jointed nicely for the scale. I like how it&#39;s a smaller piloted suit, rather than a huge mech, which are a dime a dozen for LEGO at this point. The suit is a much better wielder of Freeze&#39;s huge ice gun, which has a stud-shooter on the top in an effort to create the illusion of the shots coming from the barrel. The mech has a nicely hinged back panel which encloses nicely around Freeze, and there are some blue-filled rubber hoses to create the effect of power surging through it.</p>

<p>Overall<br />
I have mixed feelings about this set, even for the deal I was able to get it. The mech is a good model, but Freeze himself isn&#39;t my favorite of the LBM rogues, and the rest is unremarkable. If you really like Freeze, by all means, get it, but this is the kind of set that disappoints completionists.</p>

"TheBrickPal","2016-12-07T01:36:31.57Z","A chilling result","<p><em>The LEGO Batman Movie&nbsp;</em>is looking to be one of the biggest new films of next year; perhaps not just fueled by the&nbsp;fandoms&nbsp;of both LEGO and DC Comics, but even by the general theater-going population and animation lovers, who found themselves impressed by&nbsp;<em>The LEGO Movie&nbsp;</em>when it debuted merely three years ago.</p>

<p>In light of this, LEGO is upping the ante with their&nbsp;bat-spinoff&nbsp;and giving us a whopping thirteen sets in the first wave alone.&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70901-1"">70901</a>&nbsp;Mr. Freeze Ice Attack is the cheapest of the four-set early product launch in North America on November&nbsp;27th, and the second-cheapest of all the revealed sets for the first half of 2017.</p>

<p>The set benefits from the fact that it can be combined with two other low-priced ones and that it has three&nbsp;minifigs&nbsp;- including one of the&nbsp;Caped&nbsp;Crusader&rsquo;s most famous and cold (pun intended) rogues. Plus, it contains a wonderful little&nbsp;mech&nbsp;for the titular villain. But is it really full of energy like the facility it takes place in, or does it leave the theme on thin ice? Let&rsquo;s find out...</p>

<h2>Box and Contents</h2>

<p>The first thing you see of any set before you build it is the box, and this one definitely does not disappoint and should stand out on toy shelves.</p>

<p>We are met with the age range of 7-12 (*The Man Upstairs voice* &ldquo;That&rsquo;s just a suggestion. They have to put that on there.&rdquo;), the piece count, name (on North American copies), and the main scene of Batman doing battle with Mr. Freeze and his&nbsp;mech, in order to save a poor frozen security guard! The yellow tiled pattern of the top banner is bright and appropriate as Batman stares at us from the top right corner. It should be noted that the theme is labelled &ldquo;LEGO The Batman Movie&rdquo; on all of the set boxes, in order to avoid the repetition that was LEGO The LEGO Movie!</p>

<p>The back of the box appears to depict later in the fight, with Batman able to knock Freeze&rsquo;s&nbsp;mech&nbsp;to the ground as the security guard escapes his ice prison and flees. Play features are advertised and we are encouraged to &ldquo;Build Something Batman&rdquo; - bringing to mind DC and Marvel Super Heroes&rsquo; 2016 &ldquo;Build Something Super&rdquo; slogan.</p>

<p>Inside the box are two numbered groups of plastic bags of parts, a small sticker sheet and a sixty-eight page instruction booklet. The end of the booklet shows off other TLBM sets, the LEGO minisite, and ads for DC Comics Super Heroes sets as well as an upcoming app called LEGO Life.</p>

<p>You must be looking for new and interesting parts in such a small set. Well, you&#39;ll be happy to know that this set is chock-full of them...</p>

<ul>
	<li>Utility belt in yellow (with a spare!)</li>
	<li>Black gun (debuted this year)</li>
	<li>Mech torso skeleton</li>
	<li>New bulky minifig armor</li>
	<li>A new style of fists with Technic holes for connection (2x)</li>
	<li>Three red &lsquo;macaroni tubes&rsquo; (<a href=""http://brickset.com/article/24162/the-new-macaroni-tube"">Huw looked at the design back in October</a>)</li>
	<li>Four medium blue &lsquo;L&rsquo; tiles</li>
	<li>A plethora of SAND GREEN pieces</li>
</ul>

<p>Onto the two m&rsquo;s: minifigures and models!</p>

<hr />
<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>I suppose you are wondering what&nbsp;<strong>Batman</strong>&nbsp;is doing in this set based off of&nbsp;<em>The LEGO Batman Movie.</em>&nbsp;I mean, seriously, why is that?!</p>

<p>...Don&rsquo;t worry, that was just me trying to pass off an incredibly bat joke. I mean, bad joke. Ignore&hellip;</p>

<p>But yes, Batman is here. (*Will Arnett voice* &ldquo;Relax everybody, I&rsquo;m here.&rdquo;) Surprisingly, kind of. It is noteworthy that there are only two sets in the line he does not appear in at all; including one in the very same price range as this one!</p>

<p>Admit it; it would have been very boring of LEGO to include the exact same LEGO Movie variant seen in&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70817-1"">70817</a>&nbsp;Batman &amp; Super Angry Kitty Attack in all TLBM sets. And yes, while this minifig is very much similar, we have a slightly-different-but-still-very-expressive couple of face options, as well as a new utility belt mold that slides in between the legs and torso. In the same theme, Batgirl also takes advantage of the yellow belt while Catwoman sports purple (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70902-1"">70902</a>) and orange (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70912-1"">70912</a>) ones. Back to this figure, though. Because of the extra piece, the torso printing does without belt printing. It&rsquo;s an odd choice, but an interesting one that actually improves the figure for me.</p>

<p>Finally, Bats has a new cape - same shape, softer material. He is equipped with a flamethrower to bring the heat to the fight; and of course, his trusty Batarang is present too. (*Will Arnett voice* &ldquo;Pow! Wham! FIRST TRY!&rdquo;) Everything is awesome - new-old Batman is a win!</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Freeze (Dr. Victor Fries)&nbsp;</strong>has appeared in no more than than three different variations since the original Batman theme emerged in 2006 (eleven years ago!) - with a fifth coming in Juniors&rsquo;&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10737-1"">10737</a>&nbsp;Batman vs. Mr. Freeze early next year - but this fourth version may be the best yet! This specific version of Freeze is exclusive to this set thus far and I can imagine it will be coveted very much in the future if it remains that way.</p>

<p>The figure recalls many past versions of the character; particularly with cybernetic parts like the one depicted in&nbsp;<em>Batman Beyond</em>&nbsp;- much like the 2013 figure. The red goggles also bring to mind the 2006-2008 figure, while the skin tone matches this year&rsquo;s &lsquo;66 TV series minifig (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30603-1"">30603</a>). A new large armor piece is used here to fit in between the torso and head, and a classic translucent dome goes over the head to attach to the aforementioned armor. This armor will also be used in a similar fashion with&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/71017-11/Red-Hood"">Red Hood</a>&nbsp;in the upcoming CMF series based on the movie. It looks simple but works fantastically. The rest of the body is a dark blue hue with light blue, grey, silver, white and black details.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a wonderful new take on the character while echoing previous incarnations at the same time! Freeze is armed with a comically-oversized ice blaster with a stud-shooter tacked on. For, you know, playability!</p>

<p>The minifig roster wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without a generic&nbsp;<strong>Security Guard</strong>. Indeed, an unnamed one is included here, and has found himself the hapless victim of Mr. Freeze&rsquo;s icy wrath! The figure is definitely my least favorite of the three, but the simple design is welcome and it is nice that a hero actually has a citizen to rescue in a LEGO set, for once.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Mr. Guard is made more interesting with the inclusion of two different faces; one calm and one scared. He wears a protective suit, helmet, yellow oxygen tank and wields a two-piece gun - which may or may not be much of a help to his predicament.</p>

<hr />
<h2>The Completed Model</h2>

<p>The three completed models are rather small; as one would expect, I suppose, of a set of this size. However, all three deserve props for representing a presumably short scene in the film adequately in a cheap, physical form.</p>

<p>The smallest and least exceptional model of them all is an <strong>ice prison</strong> for poor Mr. Guard (I will continue to call him that). It opens on a hinge and does its job well enough. I do wish the white were replaced with a blue shade; preferably the shade that most of the rest of the set uses. It&#39;s not really much of an issue though, and we can easily pretend it is slight frost forming at the bottom. The grey is an eyesore, though... eh, what can you do?</p>

<p>A figure can of course be inserted on the inside studs to simulate being frozen in a block of ice. It&#39;s a rather tight space...</p>

<p>The main scenery build consists of a small <strong>computer terminal</strong> wall along with a short white gas tank, piping, a valve and simulated catwalk above. We will have to wait and see whether a similar-looking scenery build will be seen at the Gotham Energy Facility in the film, but it is safe to say that this is a scaled-down, approximated version of something we will see - that is, if we see anything like it at all!</p>

<p>Two stickers are used in this one model; the most out of the three builds. One is a meter to gauge some measurement - gas pressure, perhaps? It is placed on a black 2x2 circular tile and is complete with the initials GE (Gotham Energy) at the bottom. The other sticker showcases a monitor with some data and imagery, put on a tan 2x2 tile and stationed next to an obligatory coffee mug.</p>

<p>To the right of that and just below the meter is a couple of 1x1 green/red lights and a simple lever in the middle. One can only wonder what this whole contraption is capable of, and whether Mr. Freeze will use it to his advantage!</p>

<p>A single macaroni piece sticks out from the side of the wall, leading to a classic wheel element used as a spinning valve. The entire left, non-wall section of the model is connected via a hinge - allowing for some interesting potential positions. Two more red macaroni pieces are connected here to the five-piece tank. Definitely a target for the former cryogenicist...</p>

<p>As for the back? Let&#39;s just say, there&#39;s not much to see.&nbsp;On either side of the model, you&#39;ll see a bar and clip used to connect&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70900-1"">70900</a>&nbsp;The Joker Balloon Escape and&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70910-1"">70910</a>&nbsp;Scarecrow Special Delivery respectively.</p>

<p>Now for the best part... the&nbsp;<strong>mech</strong>! You&#39;d have to be be crazy not to appreciate a good LEGO&nbsp;mech, and this one is made to be like the mechanical exosuits that have kept Mr. Freeze alive over the years. Most of the&nbsp;mech&nbsp;is made up of smaller pieces commonly used for greebling, such as grills, guns for exhaust, and slopes - definitely giving it a sci-fi feel.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all built around a brand new, specialized skeleton piece with ball joint, stud snd pin connection options at almost every angle. While it may be specialized, it works wonders and I am intrigued with the possibilities of what MOCists could do with it. I cannot wait for it to show up in other sets; we already know that the Nexo Knights Battle Suits will be using it - who knows where next?</p>

<p>The back of the&nbsp;mech&nbsp;features a hinged area in order to get Mr. Freeze in to pilot it. All of the trans-blue must mean that this hatch is the source of all of the mech&#39;s ice powers! Two translucent hoses, injected with blue inside - representing such power - surround the&nbsp;mech&nbsp;on both sides.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeze - or any minifig to be precise - is able to stand on the two exposed studs inside of the skeleton. The interior of the &#39;cockpit&#39; is crowded but serviceable, with simple blue and silver control panel detailing stickered onto a slope.</p>

<p>Once built, the&nbsp;mech&nbsp;is quite ready to go for its &#39;playtime&#39; with Batman. Points of articulation are present at the shoulders, hands (the new fist element mentioned earlier), waist and knees. The contruction of the waist section means it can even rotate a full 360 degrees! Finally, the gun that the Mr. Freeze minifigure holds can also be held by the&nbsp;mech&nbsp;- Gotham City is in trouble now!</p>

<hr />
<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>Those who thought that this set would be a dud need to&nbsp;<em>chill</em>&nbsp;out. The entire scene is wonderfully executed, with the computer terminal area being as good as it can get for the minor build in a $20 set, and the main build (Mr. Freeze&#39;s&nbsp;mech) is outstanding for its small size.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, in the end, if you are on a budget and desire more, there are better alternatives out there. For five dollars less you can get the amazing&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70900-1"">70900</a>&nbsp;The Joker Balloon Escape which also includes not only Batman but archenemy Joker too - and for the same price as this,&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70902-1"">70902</a>&nbsp;Catwoman Catcycle Chase exists with more substantial models and three desirable and popular characters.&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70910-1"">70910</a>&nbsp;Scarecrow Special Delivery is also a contender, but I think I prefer this set over that one. And with 70910, 70901 and 70902 you can combine them all to form a nice, but small, Gotham Energy Facility building for $60. However, $60 isn&#39;t cheap and the added incentive of a combination model won&#39;t be the main reason many will be buying these three sets.</p>

<p>When looking at it from a price-per-piece perspective, this set beats out 70902 by a margin, but is just shy of 70910&#39;s 9.8c per piece. Overall, it depends on what you are after. Of course, if you&#39;re anything like me, you&#39;ll want to buy the whole entire range!</p>

<p>When not taking other sets into consideration, three&nbsp;minifigs&nbsp;in a set of such a small size is almost too generous of LEGO - and the terminal is good enough even without the tick-bomb and entrance from other sets. My only real complaint is the lack of elbow poseability on the&nbsp;mech, but I understand that compromises needed to be made at such a small scale - and making the arms longer to accommodate greater articulation would have thrown proportions off. In the end, you get what you pay for.</p>

<p>On its own,&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70901-1"">70901</a>&nbsp;Mr. Freeze Ice Attack is an almost-but-not-quite-perfect set; making a great addition to the portfolio of The LEGO Batman Movie!</p>

I also like to add that&nbsp;The Mr. Freeze Attack also connects with 70900.</p>

<p>The box comes at a decent size larger than the small one, the front displays the set alongside the theme label, as for the back it displays the features of the set, as always. There is only 1 instructions booklet, 2 bags and a small stickers sheet.</p>

<p>As for the parts, you get 2 of the ugly rock piece in transparent blue, and that&#39;s to create the effect of an ice when Mr. Freeze freezes a defenseless soul and in this case its the Security Guard. some of the parts are the normal bricks that we know but the most importantly&nbsp;is the new mold for the mech that helps to create simple practical and smaller mechs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build of the set had simple moreover practical techniques, the&nbsp;build&nbsp;of the wall was decent, but I liked the lever anyway and the computer screen alongside the valve&nbsp;and the pipes.</p>

<p>The most important build was Mr. Freeze&#39;s mech, my most favorite were the freezing gun, the back escape and the snow boots, I also like to add that there is an excellent pose ability in it.</p>

<p>There are three mini-figures&nbsp;in this set, Batman, Mr. Freeze and The Security Guard. I Choose not to go into deep details for it.</p>

<p>The Complete Model is quite decent but there are&nbsp;some playability in it, as I mentioned above the mech has a great deal of pose ability, the iceberg that holds&nbsp;the guard frozen can be opened and closed easily to attach&nbsp;and displace&nbsp;the figure, moreover you can use it as an iceberg in your city or whatever you want. The wall could also be attach to set No. 70910.</p>

<p>All in all it has nice play ability for the young kids or it could be used as a display on your shelf or in my case on my office desk.</p>
