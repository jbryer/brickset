This set!","<p>With &quot;The LEGO Batman Movie&quot; on the horizon, there has been no shortage of Batman themed LEGO sets. As a rather large Batman fan, I have been looking forward to new interpretations of&nbsp;classic Batman ideas such as the Bat-mobile and Arkham Asylum. &nbsp;The biggest surprise for me though has been the range of Batman characters made available in minifigure form. &nbsp;From&nbsp;the Batman Movie Collectable Minifigures to the various sets, there have been some rather obscure characters made LEGO.</p>

<p>This is what inspired me to buy this set. &nbsp;In total, it includes five minifigures, which is even more than some of the larger Batman Movie sets such as the Batcave and the Lowrider. &nbsp;I rarely buy sets based on minifigures alone, but for a set that costs thirty American dollars, I found it hard to pass up. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>I am happy to report that the five minifigures included here did not disappoint. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with the most basic of the five: Batman himself. &nbsp;I will admit that this is the first Batman Movie set that I have opened and built, so I am unsure if every set has the same Batman figure. &nbsp;As a person who owns many LEGO&nbsp;Batmen, I will say this is a nice one. &nbsp;It includes a utility belt, which I find to be a plus, and the detail on the torso is simple, but effective. &nbsp;The face includes two expressions: a stern Batman and a shocked Batman. &nbsp;I will say that the eyes are a bit strange on the shocked Batman face since they don&#39;t completely align with the cowl. &nbsp;Still, for play and display, this is a serviceable Batman.</p>

<p>Personally, I am a big fan of the Riddler, but have found most of his minifigure variations lacking&nbsp;(outside of the Classic Frank Gorshin&nbsp;Riddler, which I feel is fantastic). &nbsp;Most of the older Riddler figures look more like a henchman than a major villain. &nbsp;I am happy to report though that I find this new Riddler figure to be superb. &nbsp;The torso print is precisely detailed&nbsp;and features many question marks and great printing on the arms (note: all the old figure I have seen just have one question mark). &nbsp;The hairpiece includes both hair and a proper riddler hat, which I appreciate. &nbsp;The face features two expressions: smug delight and annoyance, which are the quintessential Riddler expressions in my opinion. &nbsp;On top of this, the figure holds the classic Riddler cane which includes a well molded green question mark piece. &nbsp;Overall, I find this to be a stand out figure.</p>

<p>Now, we came to the other three minifigures who are of more obscure villains. &nbsp;I will admit, there are some villains in the Batman Movie line that I don&#39;t recognize, but these three are among some of my more favorite of Batman&#39;s lesser known adversaries.</p>

<p>First, there is Kite-man. &nbsp;His villain name tells it all; he is a man who flies around on a giant kite. &nbsp;I will say that LEGO perfectly captures this ridiculous character. &nbsp;He has a rather garish costume featuring a lime green torso with a bright yellow kit emblem, a bright yellow helmet, and a red visor. &nbsp;On top of this, the figure includes a brick built red and grey kite apparatus. &nbsp;He has a angry expression, but my favorite part of the figure has to be the extremely happy expression. &nbsp;Not only does it look great on the figure, but it perfectly encapsulates&nbsp;the Kite-man character. &nbsp;If you know anything of his comic and cartoon appearances, Kite-man is very happy to be Kite-man. &nbsp;That is very much on display in this figure.</p>

<p>Next is the minifigure of Magpie, a villain obsessed with shiny things. &nbsp;To be honest, I have never read a Batman comic that featured Magpie, but she was a large part of the short lived &quot;Beware the Batman&quot; Cartoon Network show. &nbsp;As the one human being who loved that program, I am glad they seemingly based the minifigure on her&nbsp;appearances from that show. &nbsp;Magpie has a distinctive white bob as well as a well-detailed&nbsp;face that consists of sharp grey eye liner and crimson markings on both expressions. &nbsp;The torso piece has some very nice detailing, though it is covered by an upper piece that features a red jewel like centerpiece. &nbsp;A disappointing aspect of the figure is a lack of legs, instead having&nbsp;a sloped block skirt piece. &nbsp;Still, despite not being poseable, the block piece has some good detailing on the front.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, we have Calendar Man. &nbsp;Some people may know the newer version of the character who appears in the Long Halloween graphic novel&nbsp;and the Arkham City video game, who is a rather dark villain and not seemingly fit for LEGO. &nbsp;This minifigure though is based on the classic silver age version of the character who is far more outlandish. &nbsp;This is the only one of the five minifigures that has printing on the legs and it very much brings a welcomed pop to the character&#39;s design. &nbsp;His torso includes a makeshift calendar belt that is nicely detailed. &nbsp;Calendar Man has only one expression, in which he looks very confused. &nbsp;On his head is a red helmet that features a distinctive grid calendar. &nbsp;The detail bringing the whole character together has to be the cape. &nbsp;It comes in two pieces and is frayed in four parts in order to look like the classic calendar cape.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this set is worth it just for the minifigures. &nbsp;They are great versions of rare characters. &nbsp;On top of that, they are unique looking and very colorful, so I am sure a child would love them, even if he or she had no idea who the characters were.</p>

<p><strong>The Model:</strong></p>

<p>So, I have spent a lot of time praising the minifigures, but what of the model itself? &nbsp;Actually, I found myself liking the model aspect of this set far more than I thought I would. &nbsp;Yes, it&#39;s a LEGO car, but I would call it a particularly good LEGO car. &nbsp;It very much fits the Riddler and includes some nice details. &nbsp;The back of the car is very interesting and has a unique amount of detail under a clear case piece. &nbsp;By pressing lightly on it, the back raises up to reveal two missile shooters, which are the set&#39;s primary play features. &nbsp;The colors of the rest of the model include two different shades of green as well as&nbsp;white, which makes it look like some kind of cartoony villainous sports car. &nbsp;I could see a child being a huge fan of&nbsp;the completed model.</p>

<p>It did not take very long to build and didn&#39;t feature any innovative building techniques. &nbsp;Still, I had a fun time building it for what it was and found it more interesting to build than the average LEGO car. &nbsp;The sloping front and back were fun to construct and I really liked constructing the back part of the model.</p>

<p>I also think this is an excellent parts pack. &nbsp;It includes a lot of sloped and triangular pieces in a unique shade of green. &nbsp;The headlight section could also make for interesting windows. &nbsp;I could definitely see myself taking the model apart and making some kind of fun MOC out of it. &nbsp;I could picture the pieces being used for something plant like.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL:</strong></p>

<p>I am a huge fan of this set and highly recommend it. &nbsp;It seems to be cheaper in American dollars than in other currencies, but I would consider it a must own for a Batman fan who wants some lesser known Batman figures and a very well designed Riddler figure. &nbsp;I would also recommend this to parents who want to buy their children a fun LEGO set. &nbsp;The colors and design of the car and the characters would have really appealed to me as a child. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I am glad I made this my first LEGO Batman movie set and look forward to building more!</p>

Only stickers for details though, no printed elements, just a single sticker with a question mark to put on the hood. Again strongly recommended and much better value compared to the 25$ Mr. Freeze set.</span></span></span></span></p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-01-03T20:43:53.38Z","Riddle me this: why did I not get this one earlier?","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This set is in many ways a pleasant surprise to me, and - in hindsight - I wonder why I have not gotten this set earlier. The three&nbsp;bad guys and one bad woman minifigures are excellent, and the car looks quite sleek and nice. The missile launchers&nbsp;are nicely integrated into the build. IMHO&nbsp;the set&nbsp;is fairly expensive - as are most Batman Movie sets - but it still holds up well against its competitor at this price point (the Penguin Arctic Roller) and even slightly higher (the Joker Notorious Low Rider). IMHO The big plus of&nbsp;this set is the number and quality of&nbsp;unique minifigs included.&nbsp;Especially if you see this set at a discount, I would not&nbsp;hesitate to pick it up.</p>

<h2>Building experience</h2>

<p>There are two builds in this set:&nbsp;the kite for Kite Man is a very small build, and the bigger sports car owned and operated by the Riddler. There are only two stickers&nbsp;that IMHO are essential (dashboard dials and the Riddler sign) to put on. The build itself is quick and easy, the most challenging part for me was making sure I combined the right wing-elements for Kite Man&#39;s kite.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The kit itself can easily be built in 20 minutes, and should not offer any serious issues for children on the lower end of the age range (7-14) given for this set. I did not find the build significantly more challenging than for instance the City Pizza Van (which is given for ages 5-12). The building steps themselves are logical, in small steps and easy to follow in the manual.To me the most interesting aspect of the build was how the designer used many pieces to maximum effect while keeping the build simple and the number of parts down.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>The minifigures are one of the strongest aspects, if not the strongest aspect of this set, as most of them are unique and IMHO quite appealing.</p>

<p>Batman is the most uninteresting one, and also the most common of the four Batman-with-utility-belt minifigs around, as it is currently included in 6 sets in the Batman Movie line-up.&nbsp;Kite Man is the only minifigure without an alternate face print.</p>

<p>All four criminals included in this set - Kite Man, Calendar Man, Magpie and the Riddler - are exclusives for this set (though the Riddler in&nbsp;prison garb is included in the Arkham Asylum set). Kite Man, to me, is the most uninteresting figure - by far. The kite&nbsp;is what makes him interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Calendar Man stands out due to his bright red uniform and his striking cape with Dracula-style collar. The latter has to be folded somewhat to shape it properly though, and is a separate piece.</p>

<p>Magpie in her looks and style - the striking black dress, face and hair - made me first think of a female Dracula, and even somewhat of&nbsp;Darth Malgus. She is armed with some dynamite.</p>

<p>The star figure of this set is the Riddler. As another reviewer has already stated, the minifigure seems inspired by the Jim Carey rendition of this famous villain. If there is anything to nit-pick about with this minifig is that the print of the question marks only covers the back and front of his torso, and not the sides (it does cover the arms though).</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Kite Man&#39;s kits is nice and small, and a fun little build. It is nice to see what the designer has been able to achieve with a limited number of pieces. The use of pulleys as mirrors is a nice touch.</p>

<p>The Riddler&#39;s race car is sleek, and looks fairly small. However,&nbsp;looks are deceiving, as apparently this racer is &#39;only&#39; 8 cm shorter than the Joker Notorious Low Rider (70906) and only 4 cm shorter than Penguin&#39;s Arctic Roller (70911), while being of similar width. The result is very satisfying, and also looks like a car fitting the Riddler&#39;s personality - as depicted by Jim Carey. A mini figure easily fits&nbsp;inside behind the steering wheel.</p>

<p>The designer has nicely and effectively modeled the headlights&nbsp;as well as the engine. The engine compartment also hides the spring-loaded missile shooters, and has to be tilted upward&nbsp;to be able to use the missiles. It is only then that the missiles clear the car&nbsp;and the minifig in the driver&#39;s seat. Hidden by the central front cover - between the head-lights - is a double barreled cannon.</p>

<p>I like the colour-scheme for the car&#39;s exterior and interior, and generally the effort made to cover most studs with smooth tiles. If there is one thing to nit-pick about it is that there is no place to store the Riddler&#39;s staff.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>This set is - it seems - above all intended as a play set. IMHO the car by itself does not stand up well as a pure display model, and the minifigures themselves invite play. The car handles nicely (though perhaps a bit on the large side for the hands of small children), and the missile shooters are integrated well - one is unlikely to launch the missiles by accident, yet they are&nbsp;not difficult to launch when one wants to, and quite easily reloaded.</p>

<p>IMHO the car can be used effectively as a display model when part of a larger display - with other&nbsp;Batman Movie vehicles like the aforementioned Arctic Roller or Notorious Low Rider, or even some of the larger Lego City vehicles - or overall display scheme.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Although in price-per-part ratio this kit is expensive (even for the Batman Movie line), I have come to like it more and more. Part of the expense is made up for by the inclusion of 5 minifigures, 4 of them unique to this set. Personally&nbsp;I think Calendar Man, Magpie and especially the Riddler are among the better if not the best&nbsp;minifigures the Batman Movie line has to offer.&nbsp;Riddler&#39;s car itself looks good as well. Overall I think this set can seriously compete with the similarly priced Penguin&#39;s Arctic Roller and the higher priced Notorious Low Rider. Whether it does so successfully is to some extent a matter or personal taste and preference: do you like the colour-scheme&nbsp;and looks of the vehicle, and are you willing to trade in size of the vehicle for more (and better?) minifigures. IMHO there is nothing wrong with paying regular retail price for this set, and one should seriously consider picking this set up when it is found at a discount.</p>
