The action features work very well, a great selection of minifigure including an exclusive figure, and a great PPP! My favorite thing about this set is the Design and size of it. The only thing that is missing though are real hands with fingers for Clayface but the 6 stud shooters work well. I recommend it to anyone who likes Batman, Clayface, a good price and even for a first lego set! 10/10 best 2017 set so far!</p>

"Sethro3","2017-02-21T22:54:14.66Z","A medium Nougat parts pack or fun play set. A clayface conundrum awaits.","<p>This was one of my first LEGO Batman Movie sets. From reading Batman comics, I knew I&#39;d want Basil Karlo in figure form. I&#39;m glad LEGO released him, although I would have expected him to be more Big Fig scale and similar to the first LEGO Batman video game. I am glad they brick built him because the stud adds a lot of texturing to how he would look when he is changing his form.</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>- Size, especially for price. Clayface is quite huge. You can capture the difference in scale by looking at the picture, but having it in your hands he looks monstrous.</p>

<p>- Two unique figures. One being the brick built Clayface of course, but also the mayor. She isn&#39;t a crucial character to have necessarily, but I always welcome new prints and skin colors.</p>

<p>- Variety in Clayface&#39;s hands. You can have two stud shooters or switch one out for a clay hammer. The stud shooters work really well with that new piece. But be careful, you don&#39;t want to loose the new medium nougat colored studs. They are rare now, but will likely be plentiful in the future.</p>

<p>- I like that it is sturdy despite all of the small pieces. It also holds its weight quite well. The feet are broad enough it stands up well without tipping over.</p>

<p>- All of the medium nougaty goodness...Yum!</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- The price is good, but keep in mind how many tiny pieces are included. The 1x1 round stud is in abundance, so that will artificially inflate the piece count.</p>

<p>- Another Batman. This will be a complaint in all of my reviews since I already have so many of them. But if you are only getting one set, then it is important they included him.</p>

<p>- It would be nice to see some actual fingers, but I don&#39;t think that pieces comes in medium nougat yet and the designers probably wanted to work in the stud shooter for play value. If they ever release them in the right color, I will have to modify at least one hand to grab Batman and the other to shoot him.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>I am a fan of this set. It is a lot bigger than you expect from pictures. The price is acceptable for the number of pieces, but I still had to wait for a sale. The moment I found one on Amazon, I clicked buy and haven&#39;t looked back. Even if you don&#39;t care about Batman or Clayface, I would recommend this set. A lot of recolored pieces will help it sell itself.</p>

"jango_e1_g3","2017-04-12T20:30:51.06Z","Surprisingly good!","<p>I bought this set along with the Catwoman cycle during targets recent&nbsp;heavily&nbsp;discounted sale and I must say, it&#39;s a bit better then I anticipated! Firstly a little background, this is obviously from TLBM&nbsp;but Clayfaces design is similar to his form at the end of Arkham&nbsp;City while the head and short legs is more in line with BTAS.</p>

<p>&#39;Figs</p>

<p>First up another Batman. I don&#39;t really mind another one, as most kids would want a Batman with what ever set they got so it&#39;s fine. He is the same as the rest, 89 style torso with sculpted abs and a crisp yellow bat logo. The cape is the new-ish soft kind, easily allowing him to sit&nbsp;unobstructed. The new belt piece is cool..I guess, still warming to them. You do get a spare or two along with 2/3 baterangs not to mention another two different expressions on the head</p>

<p>Mayor Mccaskill. A glorified&nbsp;cameo vehicle character if there ever was one, still a fine minifig. She is features a simple blue professional&nbsp;looking&nbsp;suit and a new hair piece.</p>

<p>The actual set</p>

<p>When you get ol&#39; Clayface finally built the first you&#39;ll notice is that he&#39;s very solid. Looking at the box you&#39;d imagine all those round bits would be a crumbly mess but their all interlocked in such a way as not to fall off or&nbsp;restrict the arms (too much). Speaking of arms, he has three:&nbsp;one clay mallet and two stud gattlings&nbsp;meant to represent flinging bits of clay. I myself only built the hammer and used parts from the other two to make a pretty decent hand.</p>

<p>Even the head his a nice degree of articulation and remains firmly in place. And those eyes! From rage to sadness, he looks very alive right down to the teeth in his gaping mouth. Proportion wise I think he strikes a good balance. Might be a shade taller then Marvels Giant-man and much more fearsome to boot.&nbsp;Over all 7.5 out 10 bricks, wish the legs were less stumpy but if you see him about on sale, go for it.</p>

"PeteM","2017-09-04T17:36:51.26Z","Feat Of Lego Clay","<h3><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Box / Instructions</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The unusually square box is emblazoned with the eye-catching Lego Batman branding,&nbsp;allowing the artwork to best show off the model in full &ldquo;Clayface-smash&rdquo; mode (to assign a Marvel character&rsquo;s signature move to a DC property). The instructions are more lengthy than they need to be, but there is no confusion between colours &ndash; and when it comes to putting nougat plates on more nougat plates against a background of nougat, you do start to appreciate the part call outs!</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Parts</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Divided into four bags, the parts are heavily and obviously dominated by an array in &lsquo;nougat&rsquo; which together comprise over 50% of the total piece count. Many of these are new in this colour and as these are highlighted in other reviews, as well as in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/inventories/70904-1"">parts listing</a> on this site&rsquo;s set page, I won&rsquo;t dwell. Suffice it to say, if you&rsquo;re after 1x1 or 2x2 round plates in the colour, this set is very much the motherlode&hellip; Also of note is the number of a more recent design element &ndash; small &lsquo;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6167646/plate-w-bow-1x2x2-3"">plate with bow</a>&rsquo; (41) &ndash; as well as numerous other pieces which are great for building up a wide selection of pieces in the colour.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">There is the expected variety of what I think of as &lsquo;mech pieces&#39; for building in articulation, mostly of the ball and socket variety &ndash; sadly most of these are in grey rather than more marvellous nougat, though there are a few dark brown modified 2x2 bricks with either ball or cup attached. Also included are a good number and variety of SNOT &lsquo;angle plates&rsquo; of varying dimensions and colour.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Minifigures</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">There are two minifigs included &ndash; the omnipresent Batman (who appears in six other sets in the range), and the exclusive Mayor McCaskill. A quick internet search reveals that the mayor is a creation of the Lego Batman movie rather then part of the larger franchise which may affect desirability for collectors, but her inclusion here gives the set a more playability, even if it is of the old fashioned &lsquo;woman in peril&rsquo; variety. Her torso is printed with smart jacket and pearl necklace design, while the nicely done &lsquo;bob&rsquo; hairpiece is also unique to the figure. She gets two faces &ndash; one a grimace of terror, presumably due to an upcoming splat attack, and the other a smile of gratefulness for being saved from the aforementioned splat.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Batman is, as you would expect, dressed in the usual black (not even a hint of very very dark grey), with one of the new softer style capes and two facial expressions, both appropriately smug. The yellow utility belt piece which clips between the legs and torso was new to me, and it&rsquo;s easy to see it being used elsewhere, perhaps on a City workman or similar. I&rsquo;m just waiting for Jamie Berard to somehow make it a key piece of decoration in the next modular building&hellip;</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The Build</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The build is straightforward and taken at a leisurely pace &ndash; possibly a shade too easy for those within the ages range on the box, but that&rsquo;s not a bad thing as it widens the appeal to Batman-obsessed children in the lower age bracket.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Having said that, the initial construction of the core of Clayface&rsquo;s body certainly shows off the potential of the SNOT brackets as there are very quickly studs in all directions (well, four anyway). Thereafter follows an exercise in repetition &ndash; sub-builds for the body greebling (if that&rsquo;s a thing) and limbs are almost completely mirrored, apart from one or two exceptions which mean you can&rsquo;t afford to lose attention! The builds of the back and breast plates are best carried out on a flat surface as the initial plate-on-plate construction is quite fragile until it all comes together and is mounted onto the core.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">There are no particularly interesting techniques used, though the use of hinged plates to create a rounded shape for the body is both effective and surprisingly stable. The head construction is also interesting as it goes from unformed clump of bricks to something more recognisable right at the last step, as the printed eyes are added and the hinged 1x2 plates are moved into position to form the grimacing mouth.</span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Completed Model and Overall Opinion</span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The final result does exactly what it says on the tin &ndash; no mean feat as representing a marauding clay monster in Lego bricks must have been quite a challenge. Thankfully, the studs on bricks are ideal to represent the rough surface of the body, and it has even been granted the unexpected quality of expression &ndash; a quick switch of the eye slopes instantly creates a mournful countenance (full credit to the graphic designer!), especially if the mouth and angle of the head are tweaked accordingly.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">The main action function consists of firing 1x1 round plates from the arm canons, which works well and makes sense in terms of the story &ndash; I assume that enough of them would form a &lsquo;splat&rsquo; similar to the one supplied for the mayor to be trapped in. Though thank goodness spares of these tiny pieces are included as I can guarantee that parents across the land will be sucking these up in vacuum cleaners for foreseeable future... The ability to swap one of the canon limbs for a hammer is an excellent idea &ndash; improving the model both for display (as per the box art) and playability as it expands the battle scenarios available.</span></p>

<p><span style=""font-family:Arial"">Thanks to the ball joints the model has great posability and is very solid. Even better, the grey ball joints which usually stand out on these kind of models are almost completely disguised by various layers of plating and effective use of &lsquo;rock&rsquo; pieces at the points of articulation. This set is a rarity as a true triple threat &ndash; the action features and tactility of main model make it great for play, the articulation means it can be displayed in a number of poses and configurations, and finally it is a wonderfully nougat-heavy parts pack for any MOC&rsquo;ers in need. Something for everyone!</span></p>

"Trigger_","2017-03-11T03:41:00.807Z","My Favorite LEGO Batman Movie Set!","<p>First of all, this is my only LEGO Batman Movie set, but from looking at the others, this one is by far the best! First of all, Clayface is my favorite Batman villain. Second, onto the actual review!</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>Only two, but one is exclusive! First is Batman who appears in&nbsp;almost all of the&nbsp;Batman Movie&nbsp;sets. Although it has the most common Batman, I still like it. He has a cocky scowl on one side of his head&nbsp;and a&nbsp;scared one on the other. The second minifigure is Mayor Kill. The character is new: she is&nbsp;not based on anyone. And she is the exclusive one! Her&nbsp;cool yellow&nbsp;hair is new, and is superb. She has a&nbsp;nougat skin tone. She is also&nbsp;wearing a bright blue&nbsp;coat and an opal locket. Her bright blue legs have no printing, though. Like Batman she too has a frightened look on the other side of her head.</p>

<h2>Build</h2>

<p>Besides Clayface, there is a clay splat. Clayface shoots studs of clay to secure his victims so the splat provides a hole for the&nbsp;governor to be ensnared. Clayface himself uses rotating click-joints, from Exo Force on the shoulders, while the hips use large ball joints. These provide motion, allowing the legs to be twisted and the body to be tilted forwards or backwards, but the scope for posing his short and stubby legs is&nbsp;too&nbsp;limited. I love the use of round tiles for clay, and how they are angled with hinges, especially considering this introduces a ton of bricks in Medium Nougat! His head and&nbsp;the top&nbsp;of his arms are utilize round plates to give him a flowing-clay look. The hinge pieces used for his mouth, and the 1x2 curved slopes on the arms, are new in Medium Nougat. His eyes are printed. You have an option of three forearms for him, two of which are the same. Two have multi&nbsp;stud-shooters inside while the other is fashioned into a hammer. Clayface is constantly transforming his hands into weaponry, and&nbsp;he does it into a&nbsp;hammer a lot. He normally has fingers but none are provided here. The figure can thus be fitted with two clay-shooting forearms, or one can be switched out for the hammer, which looks better, but only because it is different than&nbsp;the&nbsp;other one. Unlike several LEGO models, the back is&nbsp;kind of more&nbsp;detailed than&nbsp;the front. With the exception of the undersides of his arms, the foe&#39;s entire body is coated in&nbsp;slimy clay and it looks awesome. The model itself is robust, certainly his&nbsp;arms and legs are not&nbsp;going to fall out, and they stay in place when posed. However it does need to be handled with care to prevent moving the hinged pieces on the chest and back and to stop&nbsp;pieces from the upper arms from falling off. The round 2x2 plates themselves are&nbsp;very secure, though, and have not budged when I play.</p>

<h2>Playability</h2>

<p>Stud shooting arms, his eyes can be reversed to show expression, his mouth can move to show expression, lots of articulation, need I say more?</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>This set makes a welcome change from the vehicles and buildings in every other DC&nbsp;set&nbsp;and introduces another well known DC Comics&#39;&nbsp;antagonist. I think the round plate- and curved slope-encrusted body conveys the appearance of something made from masses of&nbsp;viscous&nbsp;clay&nbsp;extremely &nbsp;well. Coupled with his ominous facial expression he is a worthy&nbsp;villain for Batman. The inclusion of a third forearm is&nbsp;super good, too. In my view, this is definitely the best and&nbsp;most interesting Batman Movie set.</p>

"Brick_Cuppy","2017-07-28T03:04:39.24Z","He's so cute I could eat him...... Mmmmm, Nougat","<p>I bought this set as an extra, not thinking much of it. BOY, was I wrong....</p>

<h2>Minifigures:</h2>

<p><strong><em>Batman:</em></strong> Gotham&#39;s Hero is in almost every TLBM set. And he seems to have bought a new yellow belt. This is a cool new element that fits between the waist and torso. He has printing on both sides; The front has some muscles and the batman logo; the back has some bodylines, although these are covered by the new black, soft felt cape. his legs are left plain. Batman has a double-sided head beneath his cowl. one side has a Grinning-because-I-just-beat-up-all-the-bad-guys-with-one-hand-behind-my-back expression; the other, a Grimacing-because-Robin-just-accidentally-very-purposefully-let-them-all-go visage. I think the TLBM Batman minifigure is the best one so far</p>

<p><strong><em>Mayor McCaskill:</em> </strong>The mayor of Gotham has a fancy blue suit and a pearl necklace that both look great, and a new hairpiece in cool yellow with some hair swept up in the front that looks fantastic. And to top off the Medium-Nougat Bonanza, her skin is Medium-Nougat too!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her face is also double-sided; one is a Smiling-because-I&#39;m-proud-of-my-city-that-I-made expression; the other a Frightened-because-Clayface-is-gonna-kill-me-if-Batman-dosen&#39;t-save-me-soon visage. She can be placed in the clay-splat included, while Batman saves the day!</p>

<p>This set is basically just about figures; Clayface is a brick-built figure, Batman and Mayor McCaskill are minifigures. I&#39;m glad they made a brick-built Clayface instead of a molded big-figure. I usually prefer a brick-built solution than a specialized element.</p>

<h2>Parts:</h2>

<p>This set is a Bonanza of Medium-Nougat-ey-goodness! Medium-Nougat is a relatively rare colour, and most of the Medium-Nougat pieces in this set are new in that colour. Below is a list of all the re-coloured elements in this set:</p>

</ul>

<p>The eyes are printed, and look great on the completed model. They also hide a secret, which will be revealed later.</p>

<h2>The Build:</h2>

<p>Building this set was fun, if slightly repetitious because of the arms.There are a few unusual techniques used; quite a bit of interesting SNOT work, a bunch of different hinges, and a 2x2 plate with two axles to stabilize the mouth, and it was great fun. You have to pay close attention to the instructions and where you&#39;re putting pieces because there are lots of small and the same pieces that need to be added in the same places.</p>

<h2>Overall Opinion:</h2>

<p>This is my absolute favourite TLBM set!!! It&#39;s even in my top five favourite sets that I own!</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The many ball joints allow lots of mobility, and it&#39;s surprisingly stable! The joints are strong, the pieces don&#39;t fall off, inter-changeable hands, this set is perfect for play!</li>
	<li>All the medium-nougat pieces make this set perfect for MOCs! I&#39;ve already thought of a few uses for the pieces.</li>
	<li>The studs and round pieces make it look exactly like a living mass of gooey clay! He&#39;s entirely covered with the stuff, even around the joints! So he&#39;s just as good for display as well as for play.</li>
	<li>If you swap the eyes around, his expression changes from angry to sad! Credit to the designers for creating such a fabulous set for kids and adults.</li>
	<li>The minifigures are brilliant, perfect for recreating a Batman-saves-the-day-again scene.</li>
	<li>The price is fine for what you get. 10 cents(8 cents in US and UK) per piece is good, and half of them are Medium Nougat!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>I can find no problems with this set, however it would have been nice to have a hand instead of one of the 6-stud shooters. But stud shooters seem to be in almost every set now, and this is definitely one of the most inconspicuous inclusions yet, so I&#39;m fine with it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Clayface Splat-attack is a fantastic set! It gets my highest recommendation for anyone, whether it be a gift for someone, for yourself, or for the parts, this set is perfect!</p>
