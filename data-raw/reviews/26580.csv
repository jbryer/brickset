<p>This set is a good and fun set overall - a massive and interesting BigFig, two other cool minifig&nbsp;crooks, the fun Batski, and a fun and decently sized pick-up. The build is fun, though applying the stickers on the rounded of sidewalls is a bit of a pain. The design of the truck is interesting, and the designer has done a great job of creating a bit of a ratty and - phrased in a less politically correct - stereotypical patched up red-neck hillbilly pick-up from the swamps of the American South. Think Adam Sandler&#39;s &#39;Waterboy&#39; on steroids stereotypical. Yet there are some elements on the truck that could well be improved upon, as pointed out by CapnRex in his review. And that brings ourselves to the biggerst issue: the review would have been very positive if not for its price. The RRP is simply not justifiable IMHO, in any which way. The set is way overpriced, by somewhere between 15 to 20 dollars, pounds or euros at a minimum.</p>

<p>For me personally, I have a great desire to complete my collection of the Batman Movie set range, but at RRP I would have been perfectly happy to leave it on the shelves, even if it were the only set missing in my collection. As it is, it is pretty much the only set I was missing in my collection.&nbsp;It was only a 30% off (which put it back to 50 euros) offer that made me buy it.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The Batski is a fairly quick and fun build. Its overall design is completely in line with Batman&#39;s other vehciles in the Batman Movie range: black with red highlights, and the same pin-stripe stickers. A nice detail on the steering console sticker is the fact that the Batski seems to be homed in on Killer Croc.</p>

<p>The pick-up is a nice build and, in general, not too complicated. The trickiest part was putting in the elastic bands that are part of the suspension. If not for the stickers, most 6 or 7 year olds would probably&nbsp;be able to put this set together. The stickers that are applied to the rounded off side-wall pieces are a bit of a pain to apply. Unfortunately, those same stickers are IMHO very important in giving the truck the ratty, patched up and gator-damaged appearance that is so crucial to its overall appearance and appeal. I did not see any construction techniques that wowed or surprised me. That said, the techniques used and the use of some Technic pieces (for the extended steering wheel and the suggested suspension springs) are effective. IMHO this truck is a good example of how you can make a good looking vehicle without using all kind of fancy building techniques.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Welcome are the smooth tiles with wood-print that represent planking.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are three minifigures included in this set, and the Killer Croc&nbsp;BigFig. The Batman figure is common (appearing in 5 other sets, of which only the <strong>Joker Balloon Escape (set 70900)</strong> and <strong>Bane Toxic Truck Attack (set 70914)</strong> are cheaper. IMHO there is nothing special about this minifig.</p>

<p>Thankfully the other figures are much more interesting, and unique. Zebra-man has a very nice zebra printing on the front and back of the torso, the arms, the front and side (!) of the legs, and the head. As Zebra-man is bald with only a mohawk, he has only a single face-print.</p>

<p>The female villain is Tarantula, again a nice and sexy&nbsp;minifigure. She has a good looking print on the torso (front and back), and two nice face prints with eyemask. The evil grin and evil smirk are both equally attractive.&nbsp;The pony-tail hair piece is good-looking as well. She is armed with two knife-like weapons.</p>

<p>The star &#39;minifigure&#39; is the BigFig Killer Croc. In many ways this is a unique minifig, and in its ugliness a beautiful one. Its clawas are imposing, and so is the muscular bulk of the torso and arms. His head is IMHO on the small side, having a somewhat comic effect.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The Batski&nbsp;is a well designed Batmanized&nbsp;jetski. The 2x2 round smooth plates underneath make it impossible to pose it upright on a hard flat surface. The two studshooters are quite well integrated, but could easily be taken off (and be replaced by flat tiles or black bullion pieces)&nbsp;if not desired.</p>

<p>Killer Croc&#39;s pick-up is quite nice. Its weakest part - by far - is the suspension, as pointed out by CapnRex in his review. I have little to add to it, other than that replacing the current suspension with&nbsp;actual Technic suspension springs and covering the Technic pieces would have gone some way towards justifying its RRP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I like the &#39;bodge&#39; that allows Killer Croc to control the truck, including the 8-ball on top of the gear shift. The roughed and patched&nbsp;up look of the truck is great, and the stickers definitely add to this. Overall - if one overlooks the suspension - this truck holds up well in comparison to other vehicles within the Batman Movie Range, like <strong>Joker&#39;s Notorious Lowrider (set 70906)</strong> or <strong>Penguin&#39;s Arctic Roller (set 70911)</strong>.</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>This set is above all a play set, and leaves enough room for all kind of pursuit games. The suspension works well enough to allow the vehicle to traverse rough terrain. The two crates at the back can be launched from the vehicle, and there are the aforementioned stud-shooters.</p>

<p>If one patches up the (rear) suspension a bit, this set would also make a nice little display piece.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>This would be a good set overall, if not for its price. Nice minifigs, a nice BigFig, good looking ratty truck, fun Batvehicle, in theory there is little to dislike. I BigFig, two unique minifigs, the big wheels, I know these are all elements that move the price up significantly - but IMHO the RRP - in some European countries/stores&nbsp;at 0.20 euro&#39;s per piece)&nbsp;&nbsp;is in no way justified. It makes the RRP for <strong>Snoke&#39;s Throne Room (set 75216)</strong> - which seems to draw universal scorn for it being overpriced significantly - look benign in comparison. And that is a shame. Personally, even though I think this would be a&nbsp;good to great set if living in a vacuum, I can frankly not justify picking this set&nbsp;up unless it is at a significant discount (25% off or more).</p>
