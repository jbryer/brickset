This is a very small representation of the actual movie version, but we could not expect to see that materialized as a set. There have been multiple batcaves now, so how does this compare?</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>- Extra wacky Batsuit variants with the rotating closet. The track piece spins smoothly around the central core. Also, there is room for more of the suits, so that will be fun to add to it.</p>

<p>- Further on the figures, I like seeing the cowl in more colors. You get another gold version (like in Disco Batman) and a regular blue in the new version without the chin strap. The dark blue has been used before in 5 other sets per brickset.</p>

<p>- The duck mobile is brilliant. I loved the last Penguin&#39;s duck mobile, but this is a much larger version. It rolls smoothly with the 6 wheels underneath and has a plethora of weapons to try to get the flying menace!</p>

<p>- New version of Penguin. It represents the Danny DeVito version quite well from Batman Returns. He has a new top hat, umbrella and recolor of the fur collar from Kraven the Hunter.</p>

<p>- Alfred! He was released in the 2006 Batcave and then again in the &#39;66 Batcave. It&#39;s good to have another version of him since he is so essential to Batman. This captures his movie representation really well. He has cloth coattails that really add to the character. And the baldcap could be useful elsewhere as well. The shirt collar piece is interesting. I&#39;m torn on it. I think it helps the costume, but I would have liked to see printing so you don&#39;t HAVE to use it. But it looks fine without it as well.</p>

<p>- Bruce Wayne. This is another variant of him wearing a suit. It represents his movie character well from the scene in the movie. The bowtie is a neat mold, but it would be neat to have printing. Granted this is my same complaint about the utility belt also. I like the new hairpiece really well.</p>

<p>- Riptide batboat. I love the color scheme and shaping. It is sleek and looks intimidating, just as a batboat should. Also, the trans yellow canopy will be useful for Classic Space mocs.</p>

<p>- Bat computer is impressive. It is quite large and I like the desk area. Granted, the movie screen is going to be larger than this, but I think they captured it well enough.</p>

<p>- New penguins. Granted, they have evil eyes. I liked the brick built penguins from the other Penguin sets, but having a molded piece does add something to the set.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- The build feels like a shell of a batcave. I think it captures important parts of what a cave should have, but with the walkways and openings it doesn&#39;t feel complete. Although, maybe I shouldn&#39;t be too upset since I can&#39;t expect everything at an affordable price.</p>

<p>- Price is about average for what you&#39;d expect on a set this size. I was able to get mine at Target during a promotion so I saved 25%, so I was much happier with the price. But at MSRP, I would likely skip the set until I found a sale.</p>

<p>- Lack of new figures. I think this set could have had more in the figure department. I understand they count the other variants as figures, but maybe another villain? There were so many that didn&#39;t get made into figure form, I wonder if just another extra one could have been put here. Batman is in all of the sets. Penguin (with a different head) is in another set. So ultimately the only unique figures are Bruce Wayne and Alfred and the bat suit variants which aren&#39;t as important compared to some elements.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>I would recommend this set. It isn&#39;t my favorite batcave, but it is a nice addition to the gamut of batman sets. If you can find it at a reasonable price, I doubt you will be disappointed. If you have to pay full price and you don&#39;t have any other batcaves, then I would consider it. I plan to use pieces to make my own batcave in the near future, but I do have the &#39;puter and rotating suit holder built in case I decide to incorporate them into my own version.</p>

<p>This set was a very pleasant surprise to me. Building the set was fun, there are a some nice design features, and there is quite a lot to play with. There are many minifigures and minifigure&nbsp;suits to play with, so are Penguin&#39;s &#39;duck and cover&#39; duck-vehicle and Batman&#39;s &#39;Riptide&#39; Bat-boat. This set IMHO offers quite a bit to all kinds of builders: Batman fans, children, and AFOL&#39;s that want to build a much larger Bat Cave. It is mostly a play set, with the various elements of the cave in a modular design. This results in many play features as well as elements that can easily be integrated within a much larger display of the BatCave. The biggest negative, IMHO, of this set is its RRP. For as much as it has to offer, in many ways it feels as if this set is barely worth its price; in some ways it seems to suffer from the same issue as the (in)famous UCS Assault on Hoth set (75098).</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>Let me start with saying that this build is not one for sticker haters. There are many stickers that need to be applied (every single computer screen, for one), and for many stickers (especially the computer screens) it is extremely visible when they have not been applied correctly.</p>

<p>The build starts IMHO with one of the highlights of the set: Penguin&#39;s &#39;rubber duck vessel&#39;, Duck and Cover. The most interesting pieces of the whole set could well be the orange inverted slopes. The way the head of the duck is built is interesting. Batman&#39;s Riptide boat is next, and is a nice build as well. The integration of the springloaded shooters is very well done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Much of the build of the cave is not that interesting, mostly just brick-stacking. Things become interesting when you start putting together the play features: the massive screens and controls for the Bat Computer, the prison, the suit storage and the Bruce Wayne / Batman changing feature.</p>

<p>Total build time was about 2,5 - 3 hours at a leasurely pace. I think younger children should be able to build this set, though adults would need to help them out with the stickers.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>Depending on how you count, there are 4, 7 or 9 minifigures: Batman, Bruce Wayne, Alfred, the Penguin, two Hench-Penguins, the Bat-Pack Batsuit, the Scu-Batsuit&nbsp;and the Raging Batsuit. All but Batman are unique to this set - this rendition of Batman is found in 6 other sets.</p>

<p>I really like Bruce Wayne; Bruce Wayne only has a torso print (front and back), of a white tuxedo. He has a bow tie, nice hair and an alternate face print.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Alfred is arguably the best minifigure of this set. He has cloth coat tails, a very nice print on his torso and IMHO an awesome face print. As he is bald, he does not have an alternate face.</p>

<p>The Penguin is nice, and almost identical to that found in the Actic Roller (set 70911). The face print is different though (he now has a toothy smile).</p>

<p>The Hench-Penguins are nice rubber moulds, and equipped with automated buzz-saw back-packs. The three suits (Bat-Pack, Scu-Batsuit and Raging Batsuit) look very good. The only thing needed to turn them into true minifigures is putting a face on them.</p>

<h2>The builds</h2>

<p>The Penguin&#39;s rubber duck vehicle &#39;Duck and Cover&#39; is IMHO the star vehicle of this set. It is compact, a fun&nbsp;build, heavily packed with weaponry and perfectly fits the crazyness of most vehicles in the Lego Batman Movie series.</p>

<p>Riptide, Batman&#39;s speed boat, is also a near perfect match to Batman, and the other vehicles in the series. It looks aggressive, sleek, and the colour scheme is awesome.</p>

<p>The build of the Bat Cave itself starts out with stacking plates and building the support structure. I really like the Bat-shaped design of the massive computer screen as well as the control panel. The stickers are nice, and well printed. I also like the used colour; the blue somewhat gives a back-light effect. The prison and Batman-changing module are simple but effective. I like the idea of the movable changing-rack for Batsuits, though the mechanism is rather delicate. Similarly, I wonder about the pins holding the lift becoming worn out through frequent use. The design of Batman&#39;s chair is one that could easily be copied for other uses.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This set is above all a play set - vehicles to play with, different suits to dress up Batman. The &#39;cave&#39; itself is too modular and lacks bulk to be a true display set. The Bat speed boat - with spring-loaded shooters -&nbsp;the Penguin&#39;s duck - with flickfire missiles and bombs -&nbsp;the exploding back wall of the prison and Batman&#39;s changing cave offer room for a lot of play. So do the many minifigures, especially the Hench-Penguins. The duck and speed boat can easily be handled and moved around by children. There is barely sufficient place to put the minifigures&nbsp;on the Bat cave elements.</p>

<p>The modules that make up the Bat Cave can be integrated in a much larger Batcave&nbsp;display in a much bigger mock. Also, it can be connected to the launching pad in the Bat-shuttle set (70923), though one needs some additional bricks to make it a solid/fixed connection.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, this set was in and by itself better than I personally expected. I really like the job the designer has done with integrating the Bat-symbol in the design of the set. The vehicles are good to brilliant, and so are the minifigures&nbsp;/ alternative minifigure bodies. The individual modules are nice as well. That said, somehow it does feel as if the set at RRP is simply too expensive - even if the price per piece is far from excessive. IMHO one does not go wrong buying the set at RRP (as listed on Brickset), and can justify it - but I would look for this set on a discounted price. Overall though, IMHO this is a good set.</p>

"Kaisermighe","2018-09-07T15:33:00.297Z","Good starting bat cave!!","<p>The Batcave!!! There&#39;s so much in this set, it took me almost three hours to build it all!!</p>

<p>The minifigures are really good, all of them are detailed and well done. Bruce, Alfred, the penguin-bots and three bat-suits are all exclusive to this set. Also including common Batman and&nbsp;the Penguin, there&#39;s 9 minifigures, which is great. But&nbsp;thinking about it, it&#39;s just three personalities: Batman, Penguin and Alfred. Half of the total are just different suit/Bruce and penguin-bots (which, even if well done, aren&#39;t really minifigures). So i feel like a mixed bag here.</p>

<p>The vehicles are both pretty cool. The Penguin&#39;s duckie&nbsp;is rare since it&#39;s both yellow and&nbsp;amphibian, it&#39;s obviously a tribute to the 1992 Tim Burton&#39;s Batman Returns, and it&#39;s very well done!! It&#39;s also both ridiculous and deadly, since it carries 4 missiles (2 stud-shooters, 2 flick-fire). The Batboat or &quot;Riptide&quot; is glorious. The elegant and smooth shape is something i find very fulfilling. It&#39;s also good to be played with, since it&#39;s very sturdy, and it carries four stud-shooters (can&#39;t leave the cave without these days) and two spring-loaded missiles.</p>

<p>The cavern itself is striking. It comprise of 5 platforms, the middle one having&nbsp;a rotating ladder, which&nbsp;is something nice and different and it also works pretty well. Starting on the left, the rack of bat-costumes is directly from the movie, and it&#39;s just awesome (there&#39;s also room for 4 more suits!!). Then, the prison . . . all Lego Batcaves have a prison, but i have&nbsp;never understand the logic of it. Isn&#39;t it supposed to be a secret place? So it makes even lesser sense the break-in function, a simple old-style mechanism, but how is it possible that the villains track this secret lair and break-in&nbsp;through&nbsp;the stone inside the rock for freeing their fellows? I&nbsp;mean come on! Anyway the cell is very little, but of course it&#39;s very playable. Then it comes the bat-computer. It&#39;s very cool, but why the &quot;hidden batarangs&quot; feature? Also it should have make more sense if the screens were bigger and more close to the chair. The balcony, which goes all over the cave, is very very&nbsp;good.&nbsp;And finally the changing room, again a very classic feature of Lego playable buildings, nothing too shine for me.</p>

<p>So all in all? I&#39;ve loved it! I think the set have a few silly things, which could have been put away for some trophy room, or training area, or maybe some platform for the vehicles, but it&#39;s also nice to add something from your collection to make it richer of details. Playability is at it&#39;s heigh, with a lot of figures and two very cool water vehicles and a lot of areas. And it&#39;s also worth noting that it look good, as a display piece it works pretty well, especially with some improvements. The common price is pretty ok not just as piece count, but also for all the amount of stuff you get.</p>
