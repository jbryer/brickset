<p>This is a simple build Duplo set (no instructions) suitable for kids under the age of 4 with little or no experience with Lego.</p>

<p>It consists of a Dog, Rabbit, Bird and Cat. Each animal has an accessory to play with.</p>

<p>This&nbsp;is especially suitable for young children as they do not need know-how&nbsp;to building it, and it will not come apart. It is good for association play. What sounds the animals make, what accessory belongs to what animal, and how each animal may interact with each other.</p>
