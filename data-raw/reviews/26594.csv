After we unpacked it, put it together with our little girl (1.5 year old) and played with it, my better half changed her mind and approved the purchase. The train is cute overall. It&#39;s also nice that it includes four classic Duplo car bases which are beautiful in their simplicity and versatility. Our toddler particularly enjoys playing with the kitty and the locomotive making train sounds. She is slightly curious about the number prints but mostly ignores them for now. However, she loves stacking the numbered bricks to make a chimney/tower for some reason.</p>

<p>Overall, we are quite happy with this set (which appears to be an improvement over its 10558 predecessor). It is a bit limited overall, but delivers a fun colourful push train experience that children will enjoy with some educational potential included.</p>
