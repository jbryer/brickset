<p>As soon as I saw the fox in the red shirt, I recalled playing with this in the early eighties in Canada.</p>

<p>Other random memories resurfaced: trying to poke my fingers through the holes in the trees, opening and closing the door on the ambulance, chewing on the tire. Oh wait scratch the tire comment, must have been another set with those tasty tires.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I loved the little umbrella/patio&nbsp;set as well. If I ever come across this set at a yard sale, I will certainly scoop it up!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The animal figures are the cutest.</p>
