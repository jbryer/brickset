Therefore, earlier this year, I bought&nbsp;the U-Wing and the TIE Striker, both of which I found to be entertaining builds and nice display pieces. When this set then was released I thought it would make a great backdrop for a display of the two,&nbsp;coupled with some battlepacks etc. My only real concern was the price point. In Norway, Lego is ridiculously expensive, and the&nbsp;list price for this set is&nbsp;700 NOK, or approximately&nbsp;70 GBP / 88 USD. When I&nbsp;finally bought&nbsp;it it was on a clearance sale for 1/3 of the price.</p>

<p>The build it self is separated into 3 parts (each with one bag of bricks),&nbsp;and was unremarkable with no special techniques, or interesting parts (maybe apart from two tan 15625) being used. The model&nbsp;relies heavily upon stickers for it to appear&nbsp;as one of the loading stations from the movie, which are a pain to line up perfectly.</p>

<p>The sets main feature, if we are to believe the back of the box, is its playability. Firstly there is a &quot;hidden&quot; compartment underneath which houses two extra blasters and some thermal detonators. Second is the exploding platform panels, which actually just consist of two simple levers forcing&nbsp;the parts off. Finally is the communication tower which, when tilted, unlock for the sliding doors. None of these features are particularly exciting or innovative, but&nbsp;I understand how a kid might find them attractive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For me perhaps&nbsp;the most interesting part of this set is the minifigures. The Scarif Shoretroopers&nbsp;are delightful, and I love&nbsp;the Imperial Ground Crew outfit on Jyn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all this set captures an important location from &quot;Rogue One&quot;, and does this well. But as a Lego experience I found it to be lacking on almost all accounts. It&#39;s not a bad set,&nbsp;it&#39;s just not a fun or rewarding build. The stickers only make things worse, and&nbsp;with a piece count of&nbsp;just 419&nbsp;the value for money, at least at list price, is horrific.</p>

"CharmCityBrick","2018-05-31T10:27:13.327Z","Overall Scariff Build","<p>When I first saw this set, I loved it!&nbsp; But, you quickly realize that the landing pad is way to small for anything other than playing with exactly what came with it; however, this set is perfectly built for easy expansion.&nbsp; I love the Scarif&nbsp;Troopers, the palm foliage.&nbsp; If you were to part this set out the value is perfect.&nbsp; I always have to remember, that these sets are geared toward kids and the playability of this set is spot on.&nbsp; Lots of moving functions that scale nicely.</p>

"omnius","2022-02-16T14:21:23.03Z","A disappointing vignette","<p>Released in the summer of 2017, this set depicts the Battle of Scarif, from the third act of Rogue One: A Star Wars story.</p>

<p>The vignette depicts the entrance to the Citadel Tower, home of the Empire&#39;s vault of structural designs. In the movie, the Rogue One team stage a bold raid to steal the plans for the newly-constructed Death Star.</p>

<p>The set includes 4 interesting minifigures in the form of Cassian Andor, Jyn Erso (disguised as Imperial ground crew) and two shoretroopers. Easily the highlight of the set, the minifigures come with accessories such as weapons and in Jyn&#39;s case, a helmet.</p>

<p>Once built, the scene depicts an opening doorway into the Tower, and a section of floor with a removable compartment hiding blasters and thermal detonators. A simple mechanism holds that section in place to prevent it sliding out, which is a welcome detail. A cargo case is included, which is where the &#39;connects with 75152&#39; note in Brickset&#39;s details comes into play, as that vehicle can carry it. The set&#39;s other principle play feature are the &#39;exploding&#39; floor panels, activated by pressing two recessed sections in the floor which use Technic beams to push two panels up. Useful for taking out those pesky shoretroopers guarding the door!</p>

<p>In all honesty, it is hard to recommend this set. At &pound;55 it represents very poor value for money and has limited play features. I picked this up at a 33% discount&nbsp;and it still felt expensive for what&#39;s included. I&#39;d say it&#39;s one for Rogue One completists only, or if you feel the minifigures are worth the cost.</p>
