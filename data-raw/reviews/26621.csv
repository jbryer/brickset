"Duq","2018-11-11T17:25:42.357Z","Packed with features, but a strange set","<p>Being a Speed Champions and Formula 1 fan this was a bit of a must-buy. After eventually buying and building the set it took me a few days to make up my mind about it...</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>There are a lot of different elements to build for this set, some more interesting than others.</p>

<p>There are two track sections, suggesting a street circuit like Monaco. They are very simple and only take minutes to put together. There&#39;s also a section of pit wall. Using some clever combinations of clips and bars this is a more interesting section to build.</p>

<p>Next up there&#39;s a podium for the race winners. There&#39;s a clever mechanism to rotate parts of the podium structure so you can switch between race coverage and podium celebration. The last big element that&#39;s not a car is a pit box. A very simple structure to put together but with a few nice details.</p>

<p>Finally of course there are the two race cars. Apart from the number and the colour of the camera on top they are identical and the construction is similar to the other F1 cars in the theme sofar. They are not difficult to build and use a little SNOT to good effect for the shape of a modern F1 car. There must be a rule in the set-designers handbook that explains why these F1 cars all use 1x1 Technic bricks with a half pin instead of using a 1x1 brick with a stud on the side. I don&#39;t understand why this is done; it means more parts and the blue pins are visible inside the cockpit. With 10 stickers per car they&#39;re not the worst in the Speed Champions theme. Despite the only difference between the two cars being the sticker with the car number and the colour of the jumper plate on top, the full 12 pages of the instructions are repeated for the second car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then there are some smaller items like a fuel/diagnostics trolley, a camera and.... a hotdog stand.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set is just shy of 1000 parts and they&#39;re all fairly common parts. Exceptions are the green wheels, a light grey&nbsp;cap and two printed minifig torsos which are unique to this set.</p>

<p>Some white bricks, plates and slopes for the track sections, some Technic parts for some moving parts, and lots of black and grey plates, clips, tiles and other parts. Among the more interesting parts are 7 classic garden fences in black, some pizza-slice tiles in green and a hot dog bun. To balance all the tiny parts there are also some large supports, panels and plates to give the structures some volume.</p>

<p>Minifigs</p>

<p>There&#39;s a range of characters in this set. The two drivers have identical prints on torso and legs but different heads and helmet colours. They each also have a cap for the podium. Strangely the cap colours&nbsp;don&#39;t match the helmet colours; they&#39;re black and grey. The two pit crew also have identical prints on their black torso and plain black legs. They have different heads and hairstyles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The team manager has a unique print on his white torso and plain black legs. The hotdog vendor, who apparently is called Rosceo, wears a simple orange hoodie, white trousers and a cap. The female camera operator wears another orange hoodie with a construction vest over. Finally there&#39;s a race fan in a generic checkered shirt.</p>

<p>Apart from the three torso&#39;s with Mercedes team print the minifig&nbsp;parts have all been used many times before.</p>

<h3>The models - and the strange bits</h3>

<p>The two cars look pretty good. Similar in structure to other F1 cars but different enough to be interesting. For one of them there&#39;s a different rear wing with more downforce. The green colour&nbsp;is wrong though. I feel teal would have been a better match but there aren&#39;t enough parts available in that colour. The cars have fancy spoked alloy rims that just look wrong on an F1 car.</p>

<p>The track sections are very simple, there&#39;s not much to say about them. One of them has a tv camera on a boom that can swing and lift. The camera cleverly stays horizontal, but unfortunately it is pointing away from the middle of the corner rather than in the direction of the track.</p>

<p>The podium structure is very clever. Good use of parts gives it a lot of volume and the mechanism for changing between race and podium is well done. The pit wall is small but well done and very recognisable. The old space-support looks good as a stool and I like the bar/fence used sideways.</p>

<p>The pitbox/ garage is a bit confusing; it seems partly inside out. There&#39;s a section in the middle with floodlights and wheel guns, looking like an F1 pit stop. Either side on the outside are sections with tools and computers that you would normally find inside a garage.</p>

<p>There&#39;s more strange things going on, and I don&#39;t mean the hotdog guy who is just totally out of place in this set. The set is called &#39;Mercedes AMG Formula One team&#39; and is obviously licensed and depicting the actual team. That is underlined by car numbers 6 and 44, the race numbers used by Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg. However the driver names are not used and the minifigs&nbsp;have yellow heads that don&#39;t depict the actual drivers, unlike previous Ferrari F1 sets that had flesh minifigs&nbsp;depicting Schumacher and Barrichello. They also have plain helmets, not depicting the actual drivers&#39; helmets.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a sticker with team name &#39;The Silver Arrows&#39;. While this is the team&#39;s nickname it&#39;s not used anywhere in the real F1 team.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Like some other Speed Champions sets this one is trying to be two things. In this case the realistic depiction of the Mercedes AMG F1 team takes a backseat with play features taking centre stage. As a play set you couldn&#39;t ask for more; cars, a garage, track, camera&#39;s and tools, there&#39;s enough there to play out many scenarios around an F1 race.</p>

<p>The repetition of two identical cars is inevitable when you do an F1 team but is not a problem. I would have liked to see Lewis Hamilton and Valtteri Bottas minifigs&nbsp;(and number 77 on the second car) but that would have been out of step with the rest of the Speed Champions theme.</p>

<p>This is not a cheap set but it offers good value for money. You get 100 more parts than in 75889 Ferrari Garage that sells at the same price. Despite having one less car than the Ferrari set this one feels more substantial.</p>

<p>It may not be the most challenging set to build and it may not be the most accurate model of an F1 pit box but I can recommend this set to both adult F1 fans and children.</p>
