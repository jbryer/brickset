I am a car buff for American Muscle cars and I can honestly say that I have not heard of the Carterham&nbsp;7 before. As soon as I saw it on Brickset, I knew that I wanted this set badly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box: Made of strong cardboard paper, easy to open lid, and great photo&#39;s of the model. The instruction book is top notch and made of&nbsp;card stock paper. Vivid colors and nicely balanced.</p>

<p>Parts: What else is there to say about the printing,&nbsp;the brake hubs, gauges, and the stripping for the hood? Loved the use of the hinge brick to provide the angles for the frame. Would have been nice to have steering components.</p>

<p>Build: Wow, loved every minute and I think you will as well.&nbsp;Took my time during the build due to Hurricane Mathew striking the east coast of my state. Would have been nice if steering components were included .&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons: No complaints about this set but would have been nice to see steering components include but I completely understand why they were not.</p>

<p>Conclusion: I highly recommend this set and I am now collecting parts to make this car in another color. I give it 5 out of 5 bricks. Enjoy!</p>

"Brick_Cuppy","2017-07-28T01:04:24.213Z","a great kit of a great kit car","<p>The Caterham Seven 620R is one of the most famous cars ever, fast, fun to drive, and you can even build it yourself! And now LEGO has turned Carl Greatrix&#39;s project into a kit of a kit car. Have they done the Caterham justice? Read on to find out ...</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>The box is made of good quality cardboard like most IDEAS sets, and opens via an opening-flap lid that reminds me of a shoe box. It shows the Caterham&nbsp; against a black-and-dark-grey checkered background. The back shows some features of the car. It may interest you to know that the car fits nicely into the box with some minor disassembly.</p>

<p>The instructions are the thick, durable type, with brief interviews with fan designer Carl Greatrix, and LEGO designer Henrik Andersen at the end.</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>This set is a great parts pack, because although it doesn&#39;t have any new elements, there are many rare and re-coloured pieces. Here are some of the most notable rare and re-coloured elements:</p>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;There are no stickers to be applied. Every piece is printed, like all IDEAS sets</p>

<h3>The build:</h3>

<p>Building this set is lots of fun; There are lots of different angles and interesting techniques used throughout the model, like lipstick accessories to connect the parts of the exhaust pipe, the minifigure gun to attach the rear-view mirror, and the ingenious use of clip and bar elements on the front mudguards. A lot of the build consisted of building &quot;mini builds&quot;, rather like a kit car! There is very little repetition, and the engine was especially fun to build. It was exciting to see the car coming together as you completed each step.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a fabulous set. A perfect replica of the Caterham Seven 620R, and a worthy addition to the IDEAS lineup. However, it is not without flaws;</p>

<h3>pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>It looks exactly like the real thing, down to the smallest detail.</li>
	<li>The parts selection is fantastic, with many cool pieces for&nbsp;MOCs.</li>
	<li>The build was very interesting and lots of fun.</li>
	<li>It looks amazing on display, the yellow and black contrast nicely together.</li>
</ul>

<h3>cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The front axle is strangely much higher than the rear. This is unnecessary, and the bottom of the front is just barely above the ground. also, the front axles are linked, while the back axles spin independently. This seems backward to me, and it could easily have been fixed without altering the structural strength of the model.</li>
	<li>It&#39;s expensive. $100CAD is way too much, although the US price is a bit more gentle. I would wait for a 20% discount before purchasing.</li>
</ul>

<p>This set is amazing despite some problems. I&#39;m really happy with it, and I would recommend it to any car fan or parts collector, but wait for a sale</p>

"Chris87","2021-02-18T12:57:47.68Z","Caterham Seven 620R","<p>One of my favourite builds on display is the Caterham Seven 620R. Visually it still stands out as one of the best looking models alongside a growing collection of vehicles.</p>

<p>The build is relatively straightforward with some well detailed elements. In particular the assembly of the front wheel arches, the detailing for the engine and exhaust manifold as well as the angled front section contribute really well&nbsp;to the enjoyment and appeal of the build.</p>

<p>With the yellow and black contrast the set really stands out. The rake angle from the side profile fits well with the reality of the car and it is great to look at from all angles.</p>

<p>The biggest drawback is how fragile the set is. It&#39;s not what I would consider playable as even handling the set sees multiple bits come off quite easily. When comparing this to other vehicle sets such as 10265 Ford Mustang or 10220 VW T1 Camper it just isn&#39;t as robust.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conclusion: Superb looking set and an enjoyable build. Great addition to those with vehicle collections like myself.</p>
