The really big thing about this set is Michael. I think Michael is such a great minifigure. That torso print is amazing and I love that hair and he looks very accurate to the tv show. Obliviously, the main build would K.I.T.T.(Knight industries two thousand) as he&#39;s Michael&#39;s partner in crime. I think the mini build is great for a lego dimensions pack, but I really wish that they added a license plate and a sticker saying KNIGHT or instead of a sticker a printed piece. The second vehicle is Goliath(Garth Knight&#39;s big rig) is a pretty cool addition. It looks very accurate to the show except its not black, but the alternate builds are supposed to be built with the same pieces so its okay. The weakest part of the set is the jet build. The jet does not appear in the show and it just looks weird seeing K.I.T.T. as a jet, but they needed a third build so its fine, but it still looks weird. So overall this set is a great set for fans of the show like me, however I don&#39;t think people that don&#39;t like the show would really like it except for the torso. So if you&#39;re a fan of the show you should buy this set. If your not and only want that torso you should probably wait for the Spider-man homecoming sets for the torso. Fingers crossed for Knight Rider theme.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

The torso has a generic looking black jacket printed over a dark reddish shirt, it&rsquo;s perfect for folks who want to make their own Minifigs, aside from the standard licensed Minifigure skin tone this character really doesn&rsquo;t stand out much. He also does not include any hand-held accessories.</span></span></span></span></p>

Yep, it&rsquo;s another micro built vehicle, specifically the classic looking KITT or Knight Industries Two Thousand, an experimental driverless vehicle with an Artificial Intelligence. The model is built very nicely and without any tricky or difficult moments.</span></span></span></span></p>

This model is a bit out of scale, but the build is simple and straight forward and extremely enjoyable for what it is.</span></span></span></span></p>

Jet: Now you make a flying car, hmmm, where have we seen that before? Oh right, Marty has one. Obviously this vehicle is more in keeping with the KITT look, and the build is solid though a bit lacking when compared to the digital model used in-game.</span></span></span></span></p>

I am honestly impressed with what they managed to do for these models because it isn&rsquo;t easy to make black vehicles look good, but they pulled it off.</span></span></span></span></p>

You also don&rsquo;t get any glitches here, at least I never encountered any while playing this area of the game.</span></span></span></span></p>

Highly Recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
