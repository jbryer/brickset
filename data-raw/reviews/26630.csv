"8BrickMario","2017-05-17T16:12:11.597Z","Not the key player in his own franchise? What?","<p>I wanted to explore the LEGO Batman Movie world and I liked the figure. Let&#39;s see how that went.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not too many that come to my attention, but I suppose the blank grey shields and the relatively new bar-holder-with-bar piece would be interesting.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>It makes sense that the Batman from the movie would be wearing one of his ridiculous Batsuits, and especially so players don&#39;t confuse the two Batmen. This suit is nice, especially because it&#39;s exclusive, and it depicts Batman in a medieval suit of armor. I like the bold sections of heraldic colors on his armor, and the cape and cowl go better with the rest than one would think. His cape is the softer variety, as is the practice with superhero minifigures now. He comes with a single-colored Nexo Knights sword, which is suitably over-the-top.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Bionic Steed is actually a pretty nice thing, and I like how there are touches of armor on it, too. The arms are well constructed, and the pose is quite dynamic. The other models aren&#39;t quite as impressive, but I like the flying bat vehicle.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The gameplay</h3>

<p>Spoilers: You probably should have picked the Story Pack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>LEGO Batman isn&#39;t that bad, he&#39;s got the base abilities of&nbsp;the DC Comics Batman, but with the sword-switch ability, master building, laser deflection&nbsp;and the ability to smash cracked walls. But again, Finn and various other characters can cover that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I explored the LEGO Batman Movie world, I marveled at the all-LEGO construction and the iconic locations while simultaneously seeing lots of puzzles made for Batgirl and Robin. And there&#39;s the problem. There&#39;s nothing only LEGO Batman can do. But his sidekicks both have exclusive abilites. So this character starts to feel entirely useless. Sure, he&#39;s fun to play as, but is it really worth it? Also, one thing I noticed is that all of the quest givers must be allowed to speak their entire monologues&nbsp;for the quests to work- skipping through the speeches just caused them to reset. The game&#39;s Year Two track record has been pretty buggy, so beware.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, there is one wonderful little feature. The Red Brick for the world that can be accessed via this pack or the Story Pack. The game is programmed to turn the DC Comics/Starter Pack Batman into LEGO Batman in the&nbsp;<em>LEGO Batman Movie</em>&nbsp;levels/world, and the world itself has the &quot;Always Batman&quot; Red Brick that turns DC Batman into his hammier counterpart at all times. In this form, he has the grapple, boomerang, and stealth of before, but he also has the LBM detective ability, the ability to glide, rope swing, and master build. He&#39;s animated in the style of the LEGO Movies, and occasionally when targeting, he&#39;ll recreate the hilarious &quot;first try&quot; gag from the first film. He&#39;s also armed with the Merch Gun, which will cause targets to be dressed up in lots of Batman-branded gear. But again, the Story Pack can get you the Red Brick, too.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>He&#39;s a really cool minifigure and a fun enough character, but he doesn&#39;t really aid that much in completion compared to his teammates, and even the LEGO Batman secret character isn&#39;t exclusive to the pack. The Story Pack may be more expensive, but it will save you some Hire-A-Hero studs.</p>

The last few waves are almost done, here we find ourselves with another new Batman suit. This is Excalibur Batman, he is unique to this set and so if you&rsquo;re aiming to collect all of the LEGO Batman Movie variant Batman Suits then you&rsquo;ll have to buy this set. But is he important to own for the game itself? Read on to see.</span></span></span></span></p>

Excalibur Batman is prominent in the top of the package, the artwork behind him is harder to make out, but it seems to be the Batcomputer. The rest of the set is showcased in the same field of dark blue with the green energy band contrasting.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I don&rsquo;t believe I&rsquo;ve ever discuss this before, LEGO has a different coloured band of rippling energy effect, almost appearing to be a digital grid pattern. On Fun Packs in Series 2 it is green. Other packs feature different colours, this is a clever visual ploy, aside from the size to help indicate which &lsquo;level&rsquo; of Pack you are purchasing.</span></span></span></span></p>

This is the first time I&rsquo;d have to say you won&rsquo;t find a whole lot of options here if you want these sets for parts packs. Many of the pieces in the set are fairly common, the only rarities would be the piece used for Macy&rsquo;s helmet from NEXO Knights in black and two un-printed LEGO Shield elements in plain grey.</span></span></span></span></p>

Add the unique almost faded blue cape and this Minifigure stands out as very impressive for a Batman variant.</span></span></span></span></p>

That&rsquo;s right, the Bionic Steed is a mechanical horse. This build is pretty clever, it manages to convey the illusion of a horse rearing on its hind legs thanks to the extra parts used while building for stability. Fairly solid build.</span></span></span></span></p>

No, this Raptor build is more evocative of a Bird-of-Prey, which is what Raptor means. The build thusly is a pretty poor one honestly, it kind of looks a little nice, but they could have called it the BAT-STAP and it would have been more accurate into what you&rsquo;re building here. Very disappointing build.</span></span></span></span></p>

The only downside is Excalibur Batman can&rsquo;t sit on the horse, there is a LEGO handle bar piece he can hold with his hands to make it look as if he&rsquo;s riding his faithful steed, but he&rsquo;ll just be dangling off the back of it. A larger model wouldn&rsquo;t be bad if LEGO ever revisits The LEGO Batman Movie.</span></span></span></span></p>

The fact that it has a vaguely, non-trademark infringing resemblance to the Battle Droid STAP vehicle is a nice idea, but this hodgepodge of parts as a finished model doesn&rsquo;t really resemble much of anything even half-way decent.</span></span></span></span></p>

If it had actual bat ears it would be perfect, as it is, a decent secondary build offering from the available parts. And loads more fun to play with physically than that sad excuse for a Bat-Raptor.</span></span></span></span></p>

I mean Excalibur Batman alone is well worth the price of admission, and while the digital content is available with the Story Pack, the fun dialogue you can have with Batman and Excalibur Batman on the Toy Pad together more than makes me think you&rsquo;ll want to pick this up just for that comedy alone. And two out of three decent physical models isn&rsquo;t too bad.</span></span></span></span></p>
