"Odeinoichus","2019-10-26T11:41:20.81Z","Fairly Disappointing Final Offering from Story Packs","<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Set #71264 The LEGO Batman Movie Story Pack:</span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;""> Welcome to the second LEGO based feature film in video game format and within this game pack you can take the characters into the world of LEGO Dimensions. For the price though there&rsquo;s a bit of a problem with this set, at MSRP it&rsquo;s rather high priced for the parts inside, which is probably why they slipped that extra bonus character into the set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Packaging</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Packaged in a full box with artwork all around showing off the digital content and photos showing the physical content you can see what you&rsquo;re getting for your money and if you&rsquo;re thinking it&rsquo;s a bit lacking compared to Fantastic Beasts or Ghostbusters 2016, yes, you would be right in assuming that. But the packaging is solid and looks great next to the rest of the packaged LEGO Dimensions products.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Parts</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">156 parts and honestly there isn&rsquo;t a whole lot to say about them, some nice parts inclusion, but the biggest draw for anybody again would more than likely be the Toy Pad shaped Baseplate used for the game. This single piece has a lot of potential uses, but I don&rsquo;t think its 50$ worth of parts.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minifigures</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Batgirl: It&rsquo;s LEGO Movie Batgirl, I don&rsquo;t believe this print is unique to the LEGO Dimensions set, though I could be wrong. She includes two Batarangs, her cape, cowl and hair piece attachment the utility belt and the printing is highly detailed with dual-molded legs.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Robin: Not carrying any accessories, Robin still looks the same from every set he was included in during the release of the movie. All of the printing is the same and I do not believe he has anything unique, which is good because you don&rsquo;t want unique prints for a set like this as far as collectors are concerned. And the toys looking exactly like the ones from the movie will thrill the kids who want this set too.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bat-Computer: Compared to the other Story Packs the build with this model is somewhat less impressive due to the number of parts selected and the design of the model. It&rsquo;s relatively fun and quicker by comparison though, however I can&rsquo;t help feeling it doesn&rsquo;t quite match up the level of camp that The LEGO Batman Movie was famous for.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Batwing: Here we find the newest interpretation of the Batwing in miniature scale from LEGO Dimensions, this build is fairly solid and is pretty fun actually. I found nothing wrong with this build no steps that would be irritating or difficult.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Black Thunder: You can turn a flying vehicle into a car and this build is a really impressive looking alternate model. It&rsquo;s also the only Bat vehicle that doesn&rsquo;t have Bat anywhere in the name, I guess Bruce can&rsquo;t find an excuse to shove his brand into it everywhere. The build isn&rsquo;t too bad, pretty good re-use of the parts.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bat-Tank: This one is a bit of a dud, but that&rsquo;s no fault of the build. The build is solid and rather similar to The Black Thunder, but in the end it is a different vehicle and works despite being somewhat lacking.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bat-Computer: This thing is tiny. It&rsquo;s a very small Bat-Computer and doesn&rsquo;t take up nearly as much space on the Toy Tag as the other Toy Pad inspired models. It&rsquo;s even smaller than the Gate which came with the Starter Pack. Honestly I feel they should have gone much bigger in order to capture a true Bat-Computer look from the movie design. Then again, because of the lower number of parts we got two Minifigure characters instead of one. Perhaps you can use your own parts to enhance and expand the design, it would have been nice if LEGO themselves could have given us all of the same parts, but with a more expansive model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Batwing &amp; Alternate Models: All three of these models are fun enough, not too bad, I think the Batwing is the best of the three with The Black Thunder being a close second. The Bat-Tank is just bleh overall in my opinion and is the weakest of the three models, but still it could have been worse.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The Digital Content</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Story Levels: Six stories play out the action of the Movie in typical LEGO fashion. This is a complete stand-alone experience from LEGO Dimensions in which you play through The LEGO Batman Movie&rsquo;s story. Which ultimately means you don&rsquo;t get a lot to see that isn&rsquo;t different from the movie&rsquo;s storyline.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I feel they should have perhaps gone a bit off-script at parts, more than they do with the inclusion of the Keystone element from LEGO Dimensions. It might have been more engaging that way and less like a movie tie-in video game similar to The LEGO Movie Game or The LEGO Ninjago Movie Game which came out after Dimensions.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">No big glitches or problems with solving puzzles in these levels though.</span></span></span></span></p>

Which is The LEGO Batman Movie The Batcave Joker Takedown, so take your three friends into multiplayer mode and go wild exploring this place.</span></span></span></span></p>

I don&rsquo;t recall any glitches with this content.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Character &amp; Vehicle Abilities: Because you get two characters you get a diverse set of abilities between both of them.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Black Thunder can use Accelerator Switches and ground Tow-Bars, and the Bat-Tank can do the same as The Black Thunder while also being able to Destroy Silver LEGO Objects.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">While the contents are diverse and offer multiple play options in-game, where you can explore the world of The LEGO Batman Movie and experience the Movie in Game form, this is, in my opinion, a much weaker offering compared to the previous Story Packs.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">It&rsquo;s following the same beats as the film and so if you&rsquo;ve watched the movie 10+ times you&rsquo;ll know exactly what to expect. And hey, maybe that&rsquo;s what you want. If you can still find this one for your collection at a decent price, pick it up, but if not it&rsquo;s pretty safe to skip it if you aren&rsquo;t aiming to 200% the LEGO Dimensions game. Mildly Recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
