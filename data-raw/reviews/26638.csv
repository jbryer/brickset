<p>A nice little car and, in comparison with other vehicles in the Speed Champions range, also with a limited number of stickers and above all not so &#39;busy&#39; an exterior. The model looks good from the side, IMHO, but off from other angles. Overall though, I see it as something different in the Speed Champions line, and like it for that reason. It looks like a racing car, is a nice little build, and in my opinion OK&nbsp;value for money.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>As with the <strong>Mercedes AMG-GT 3</strong> I chose to first put on the stickers, then build the car. There are fewer stickers than in most sets, just 9 in total.&nbsp; Be careful when doing that that you put them on the right way - I did not with the grille on the front. Especially tricky is the placement of the two stickers on the sides of the large window/roof piece. Thank LEGO that that the black parts on the roof were prints.</p>

<p>The construction of the car is nice, nothing special IMHO and more or less follows the usual sequence for the Speed Champions range. The use of a red rubber band to depict the rear lights was a nice touch. Most 7 year olds should be able to build&nbsp;this set with ease</p>

<h2>The minifigure</h2>

<p>There is only one minifigure included. It looks like he is wearing dark blue/blue&nbsp;racing overalls, with two nice Bugatti logo&#39;s printed on (front and back). There is a single face print (nice, nothing special) similar to that of the driver of the <strong>Ford Fiesta M-Sport WRC</strong>. As with others, he carries a wrench that can also be used to replace the wheel hubs.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Just as with its much bigger (and more expensive) Technic cousin, it has proven very difficult for the designer to capture the shape (especially the curves) of the vehicle. And IMHO this has lead to mixed results. For one, the car looks too narrow; even though dimensions of the Chiron differ&nbsp;little from those of the Mercedes AMG-GT&nbsp;3 in real life, somehow in Lego form they look off for the Chiron where they do not for the Mercedes. Similarly, the curves in&nbsp;the rear cannot be exactly replicated, as are the rear lights and the rear wing. Overall, I think the designer has done as good a job as he could with the parts available...</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>More so than other Speed Champions sets, in my opinion this is above all a play car.&nbsp; The issues with the body shape are simply too great to overlook. As a play piece, it handles nicely, and should make for quite a bit of fun. And it still could serve well as a super&nbsp;car in a Lego City display.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Of the three Speed Champions vehicles I own, IMHO this is the least successful attempt at replicating a real life vehicle into Lego. I understand the appeal of the Bugatti Chiron, and truly love the colour scheme. Unfortunately the curves/shape of the vehicle (and maybe even the colours) make the model look &#39;off&#39; from a number of angles, which is a shame. Is it worth its price? If you are looking for something different that looks like a super car, it is good value for money. If you are expecting a close and faithful miniature of a Bugatti Chiron, than this set is not it - though I would still not consider it overpriced...</p>
