"The_G_Brix","2017-06-14T22:48:22.157Z","A real beauty","<p>I got this set today from a local store. Since I saw the first pictures of it on the internet I loved it! So I bought it I as soon as I could. As I got home the first thing was to get it assembled.<br />
<br />
<strong>Car</strong><br />
It is a typical speed champions build, easy to build, although it has better proportions then the season 1 and 2 speed champions cars. But I think it&#39;s true for all the current season cars, they getting better.(except the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75878-1/Bugatti-Chiron"">Bugatti</a>...I didn&#39;t like that one)<br />
The orange is nice, a very very nice color actually, I like the rims and especially the brick-built headlights! The solution for the &quot;engine cover&quot; was clever, and not common for these builds. Which I didn&#39;t like that much were the curved sections over the rear wheels. They could be longer, or more flat, I don&#39;t know, it is a bit add, but I can live with it.<br />
And also for kids, the long plates along the sides can be sensitive, easily loosen, so you should be careful with them. If they were made them stronger, it would hurt the proportions, so I think it is a manageable compromise.<br />
<br />
<strong>Desk</strong><br />
It is a great addition, and not a usual one. It emphasizes that this is something truly design driven. It has a lot of details: lamp, small model car, the concept of the original car, and of course a coffee mug. :D<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifig</strong><br />
Again, not a usual thing for a speed champions set. And it is great.<br />
You wanna use him to sit and make car concepts.. It is OK!<br />
You wanna use him to measure the car, or admire it, or showcase it... It is OK!<br />
You&#39;re a kid, and want him to race... Get the helmet on, and Go racing!..It is OK! I mean, strange suit for race or test drive, but that&#39;s not the point. :)<br />
So this minifig suit everybody&#39;s needs in this set.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall</strong><br />
In person it is astonishing. You can spot it instantly among the other sets on the shelf from miles away! The color, the headlights, great! The desk is also something unique, you can expand it, and make a showroom for the car. As an AFOL and designer, this set amazed me, maybe you can forgive me if I&#39;m too enthusiastic. :) If you are a kid, it is also great, hop in the car and win some race ;)</p>

"Legonary","2017-09-22T14:00:29.43Z","Cool set","<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p>The build is not very difficult but interesting. The table is made in very few steps but the car has some cool building techniques.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>You get some cool parts, e.g. a cool minifigure torso print on both sides and a cool window part. I like, that you can change the rims and put a helmet on the head of the minifigure. Unfortunately you have 18 stickers and no printed elements except&nbsp;the minifigure.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>You have great opportunities to play with this set. The minifigure can be the designer or the driver of the car and you can change the rims.</p>

<p><strong>Value for money</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You get many cool parts and a minifigure for a good price.</p>

<p><strong>Overall rating</strong></p>

<p>This set gives you many cool opportunities&nbsp;to play with and you get some cool parts.</p>

"Wendigo1","2019-11-03T22:41:37.487Z","Some things canâ€™t be made with LEGO ","<p>Here&#39;s review #3, the McLaren 720S, set 75880. It&#39;s an interesting attempt, but where it succeeds isn&#39;t the car itself.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigure and Scenery: This is one Speed Champions set where the figure and scenery are the real gems. The figure can be used as a designer with his hair or a driver with the helmet. That one extra piece provides great playability. The desk is great. The single stud lamp base with robot arm is really clever. The roller skate attached to the stud plate is perfect. I can see myself using this desk in an office or apartment somewhere in my city.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The car is the usual Speed Champion standard, fast and easy (phrasing). The positives are the back and engine cover. Good use of existing pieces to approximate the sleek lines of the car, but the front is just impossible. The designers tried, but the lines can&#39;t be replicated in an accurate way with LEGO. It just looks frankly terrible. The sides have a similar issue with the plates just not looking at all like the actual 720s.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The desk and minifigure are great;&nbsp;but as a whole, this set is just not a winner.&nbsp;</p>
