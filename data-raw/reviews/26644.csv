It was a very cute item to get as a freebe&nbsp;at toys&#39;r&#39;us. I like the sticker face but, it doesnt completely match the brick color. I&#39;m a fan of the fire/feather pieces in lego&nbsp;and was happy to get three of them in this set. Just becareful&nbsp;of what direction the wind blows.&nbsp;</p>
