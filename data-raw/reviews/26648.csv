This unique three-in-one set was made available at Costco in Canada during the holiday season. It features three Microfighters from 2016 and is one of two sets with this one being given the three &lsquo;Army Builder&rsquo; Microfighters.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I&rsquo;m going to cover most of the sets in this review, if you want a more detailed review on the First Order Snowspeeder, which I bought an individual release version of prior to getting this set, please see that review. Now, let&rsquo;s get on to discuss the points of the set in question.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Box/Instructions</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Box: The main box features artwork of all three sets and Minifigures and is basically just a glorified cardboard sleeve in function, inside fit snuggly together are the three individual boxes of the sets from Series 3. It is a pretty decent value though, and the box serves it&rsquo;s purpose well. The individual boxes are just the regular Microfighter boxes and there isn&rsquo;t much to say there.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: All three individual manuals are included, one in each box. Because yeah this is just a convenient re-pack of three individual Microfighters. All of the manuals serve their function properly without any issues.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Parts</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The combined parts count is 268, all of which are fairly standard parts found in the Microfighters range. The only truly unique piece in this set is the printed TIE cockpit element, but I suppose if you&rsquo;re looking for a decent Parts Pack this is a good value for the cost.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">First Order Snowtrooper: My feelings on this Minifigure haven&rsquo;t changed since my individual set review. He&rsquo;s a really strong looking figure with an unfortunate head choice since the First Order is not the Empire and Imperial Stormtrooper heads are overused for facial prints&hellip; Or Angry Clone if you prefer.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">TIE Pilot: Being an Imperial Soldier the use of the Angry Clone head here isn&rsquo;t as terrible, but still unfortunate. At least the helmet and uniform have decent printing and the like. This represents a Rebels inspired TIE Pilot and he&rsquo;s got the small pistol for a weapon accessory.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Wookie: This is the most disappointing Minifigure, while I applaud the design improvements to the print and sculpt detailing the fact is this is just an alternate coloured Chewbacca. It would have been nice to see them re-use the Wookie Warrior head with the included helmet piece that Tarfful had, a shame they haven&rsquo;t re-done it, though it is show accurate to how Wolfwarro and his group looked in the Rebels cartoon. Also getting tired of the crossbow weapon being given to all these wookies just because Chewie uses it.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The Microfighters &amp; Builds</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">First Order Snowspeeder: I&rsquo;ve already discussed this model in the individual review. Personally my thoughts on it remain the same. It&rsquo;s a very good model and a fun army building type set for some awesome little First Order Assault Squads.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">TIE Advanced Prototype: I missed nabbing the TIE from Series 1 so I don&rsquo;t know about comparing the builds on the two of these models. However I like what was done with this Microfighter. It&rsquo;s a pretty good model with some nice design elements, especially the printed dish for the cockpit and how they make the moveable wings. Even the flick-fire missiles are pretty unobtrusive.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Wookie Gunship: While an awkward looking ship design in larger scales this Microfighter scaled version is loads of fun. There&rsquo;s a lot of playability with this, it&rsquo;s easy to swoosh it back and forth and the adjustable wings make even the flick-fire missiles fun. I&rsquo;d have to say that this Microfighter is my favorite design out of the three in the pack, it really stands out even more than the TIE and the FO Snowspeeder, probably because of how much charm it has.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">For thirty dollars this was a great deal, it gave you the chance to nab three Microfighters in one set, allowed you to experience the fun of building each one when you were ready to do so, sort of like a three-day advent calendar if you opened them up one at a time, and it allowed for numerous army building opportunities. I&rsquo;d have to say the only really bad thing about the set is the fact that there weren&rsquo;t any bonus Minifigures or wacky combination 3-in-1 style instructions that were introduced for the use of all three sets to make a Macrofighter. Overall though I strongly recommend this set for Microfighter fans who missed out on Series 3, though by now you&rsquo;d probably have to get it off the secondary market as Costco has definitely sold out.</span></span></span></span></p>
