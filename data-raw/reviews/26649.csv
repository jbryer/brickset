"A_Brickset_user","2017-01-05T15:17:42.443Z","A Fitting Tribute to 10 Years of Outstanding Sets","<p>In the Lego community, few events are as hotly anticipated as the yearly release of a modular building. Matched only perhaps by the Technic flagship and May 4th UCS, the reveal of an upcoming modular truly is an exciting time for all FOLs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Upon its announcement, the reaction to 10255 Assembly Square was overwhelmingly positive, with excited&nbsp;declarations of &quot;Day 1 purchase!&quot; mixed in with detailed analysis of the model and its testaments to modulars past (including a <a href=""http://brickset.com/article/24034"">comprehensive article</a> by Huw himself). Now the model has been released, it&#39;s time to see if it lives up to these high expectations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Assembly Square contains an absolute wealth of new parts (or new to me anyway) among its 4,002. Some of the highlights include:</p>

<p>(and I&#39;m guessing on names here because Lego hasn&#39;t published full parts lists yet)</p>

<ul>
	<li>The 1x1 plate with bar - first introduced in Ninjago last year (apparently), this little beauty is the long overdue perfect partner to&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/601926"">601926</a></li>
	<li>The 1x1 brick with studs on two side faces - You heard me right; we do now have a SNOT piece with studs only on two adjacent faces! (Yay!)</li>
	<li>The bit I can&#39;t really describe but it&#39;s on the dentist&#39;s sink and is kind of an opposite to <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/4653087"">this</a></li>
	<li>The Caf&eacute; Corner 2x3 tile (apparently 2x3s were a thing before now...)</li>
	<li>Actual new tiles - a 2x2 diagonal thing and 2x2 and 4x4 &quot;macaroni&quot;tiles</li>
	<li>So, so many recolours....</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Modular buildings are (arguably) the best build experience Lego offers, and with almost double the parts of normal releases, 10255 should be one to remember...</p>

<p>The build starts, as it always has, with the laying of floors. Due to the increased footprint (1.5 x long), there are a lot of tiles to be put down. Like, the whole Bag 1 is just tiles. So yeah, a lot of tiles. But you do get to see some new ones in action. Bag 2 takes us into the land of walls. Specifically, the walls for the bakery and flower shop - the use of shutters for the bakery windows is awesome!</p>

<p>Bag 3 takes us across the square to the blue building - a caf&eacute;, as it turns out. On a corner. What a crazy idea. Once the back walls and glass fa&ccedil;ade have been constructed there, it&#39;s onto Bag 4 - the second floor for the conjoined buildings on the right. Once we&#39;re done with the dentist and photo studio, Bag 5 does the rest of the blue building - the first floor, second floor, and roof! That&#39;s a whole lotta sand blue.</p>

<p>Music-y&nbsp;builds done, we&#39;re keeping rolling with Bag 6, the last (but not least) of our team. This covers the last floor of the buildings on the right (an AFOL&#39;s apartment and adjoining BBQ roof terrace) and then the fountain to finish off.</p>

<p>This all takes about 7 hours.</p>

<p>Your fingers will ache.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>I think I use this phrase a lot when I write reviews on here, but the finished model truly is a joy to behold. Looking at it from the outside is so reminiscent of European-type squares (if anyone from across the pnd is wondering what I&#39;m talking about, Google <em>piazza</em>) that it just brings back lovely memories&nbsp;of holidays for me.</p>

<p>Looking at the insides, they&#39;re just as good. The caf&eacute;/coffee shop is great; the use of browns and tan colours for the walls and floor creates a very warm, cosy feel, and there are plenty tables inside and out (which can&#39;t often be said for Lego eating establishments). The florist is small and a little more minimalist, but still manages to get plenty details in - the parrot stand, the plant under a bell jar, the fold-up part of the desk for access, and then the bakery is great as well, with plenty of nice minifig-scale&nbsp;cakes and other yummy treats. (or contraband, if you ask Ace Brickman).</p>

<p>The second floor is equally great, but before I get to that I&#39;m going to talk about stairs. I don&#39;t know about you guys, but I like my Lego buildings to be totally accessible for minifigures. While this is something City buildings typically lack, it&#39;s always been something modulars have done well. Fortunately, 10255 is no exception, with the blue buildings staircases initially being accessed&nbsp;through a door in&nbsp;the alley running from the back yard to the square, then going up floor by floor all the way to the roof. The other two buildings share a staircase, being joined with doors bounding between them, there is no need for separate stairs. These are on the outside of the building, accessed by going up a couple of steps in the baker&#39;s then out a door and onto the staircase. Once you reach the top, there are ladders to take you up to the roof of the orange building.</p>

<p>Anyway, on with the interiors. The blue building&#39;s first floor is a lovely little music shop, complete with saxophone, wall-mounted guitars and drum kit, which for me is the real highlight of this room. The other buildings feature a photography studio and dentist, each full of great techniques - the old-fashioned camera, the effect of a white sheet for photography, and the dentist&#39;s chair are all great. Opaque white window panes are also used in the photo studio to give the impression of half-drawn blinds, which, while clever, stick out like a bit of a sore thumb from the front of the square.</p>

<p>The second floor has the ballet studio in the left-hand building - another clever build. The mirror is much more securely mounted here than in the Detective&#39;s Office, and the piano build is lovely. The middle building features a rooftop BBQ in a nod to Green Grocer, and was one of the areas I was initially most skeptical about. However, it looks great in real life, even squeezing in a few more unexpected techniques - and the ingenious use of excavator buckets to form the excellent, PR-like roof shaping is great. The orange building has an AFOL&#39;s apartment, and this is truly great. A space-saving sofa-bed and cramped kitchen are stashed among a whole lot of minifigure-scale Lego sets!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Overall, Assembly Square is, as I have stressed throughout the review, an incredible set. The combination of fantastically original techniques mixed with ingenious architectural nods to past modulates makes 10255 a real contender for best modular, and for me, it ties with the Parisian Restaurant.</p>

<p>Well done Jamie Berard, and here&#39;s to 10 more years!</p>

"Scott1","2017-01-12T21:56:45.01Z","Wonderful Way to Celebrate 10 Years of Modulars","<p>10255 Assembly Square is&nbsp;simply a&nbsp;fantastic set. While it does have a few downsides, it is one of the best modulars so far.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box is MASSIVE. It could barely fit in the Lego Store&#39;s largest bag!&nbsp;On the&nbsp;front it has the set picture with a shining sun in the background. It is a Creator Expert set, as evidenced by the Creator and Expert logos on the box.</p>

<p>Inside, it has bags 4, 5, and 6 inside the box, while 1, 2, and 3 are inside a&nbsp;smaller box&nbsp;inside the box.</p>

<p>The instructions are not ringed like the Death Star&#39;s, but are fairly normal, just very, very thick. I would much rather have&nbsp;a ring-bound book but&nbsp;it is not too&nbsp;big of a problem.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with a&nbsp;HUGE&nbsp;collection of rare parts and colors. Two of the&nbsp;most&nbsp;obvious ones are the&nbsp;sand green&nbsp;and&nbsp;sand&nbsp;blue pieces. But there are also many other rare colors and pieces; for instance,&nbsp;a piece&nbsp;that is a real&nbsp;mirror!</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The eight minifigures are simple but very nice. They all have the plain smiley face head, which cannot be found in any other set now besides modulars and perhaps a few Creator sets. Included are a ballet dancer, a musician, a dentist, a baker, a barista, a mom, a photographer and a florist. A minifig baby is also included.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>The build of this set was one of the longest builds I&#39;ve ever preformed. It took me eight hours divided across three parts. There were a few mistakes I made while building&nbsp;that tested my resolve, however those were few and far between.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Words cannot describe how detailed this set is. You really do have to see it to believe it. The bakery is one of my favorite parts of the set. All of the cakes and pastries inside look delicious!</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>However, one of the main downsides of this set is the price. It should be around $230-$250, not $280. But the high price is nulled by the sheer beauty of this set! $280 may be a bitter pill to swallow at first, but that feeling soon goes away when you start building it. I would recommend it for any Lego fan, but this set really shines in a Modular setup. This&nbsp;might just be my new&nbsp;favorite set! &nbsp;</p>

"Zapp_Brannigan","2018-01-13T02:21:51.85Z","A wonderful set to cap off the first 10 years of modular buildings","<p>When modular buildings first came out, I was in my early teens, which meant that requesting such sets as the Cafe Corner for my birthday or Christmas would be downright impossible, obviously because of their size and price. Fast forward ten years, and I&#39;m at that point in my life where &quot;adulting&quot; is slowly beginning to take its course. In other words, with the small bit of income I earn as a grad student, I was able to set aside some cash&nbsp;to purchase the&nbsp;Assembly Square.</p>

<p>Being the largest set I own, even writing up the review for this set to me is going to be a daunting task. There is only so much that words can describe; actually owning the set is a prerequisite for getting the full experience and enjoyment. Nonetheless, let&#39;s get started while I still have a full breath of air.</p>

<p>The box contains more than thirty bags numbered in six sections. A separate, smaller white box contains Bags 1-3, a light grey&nbsp;8x16 plate, and both baseplates. The remaining Bags 4-6 are loose in the main box. Build time for me was 15 hours over 3 days, and the result was very sore and dried fingers afterwards.</p>

<p>The set comes with 8 minifigures: barista, music shop guy, AFOL&nbsp;civilian, infant, photographer, baker, ballerina, and florist. There is also a small dog (chihuahua?) who just hangs around the premises. A brick-built baby carriage is also present and the infant fits nicely in it.</p>

<p>The three separate buildings are fairly small in plan area. Nonetheless, the designers managed to pack enough details into each room to provide a cozy environment all around. Since the layout is 32x48 studs, you will either be short or overshoot by a half multiple of 32 when using standard 32x32 road plates, unless you add something else adjacent which is also a half multiple of 32 in width (i.e. 16, 48, 80,...).</p>

<p>The leftmost building has a coffee shop on the ground floor. Above the entrance is a decorative sign with a steaming cup of coffee. Outside are tables where patrons can relax and have their coffee. The interior features a service counter with old fashioned cash register, plate with pie, a couple of mugs, coffee machine, and some non-functioning drawers. Additionally, there is a small table with a single seat and a larger table with a lamp and plate with pie, with a sofa being the seat. The second floor of the left building is a music shop, again with a counter and cash register, electric guitar, acoustic guitar, saxophone, and a whole drum set. Finally, the top floor is a dance studio with a reflective mirror piece, characteristic of ballet studios, and a piano. The coffee sign and awnings are a clear shoutout to the Cafe Corner while the roof design is a tribute to the Grand Emporium. The second and first floor windows were used in the Pet Shop.&nbsp;Access to the floors is gained through a staircase which must be entered in through the alley between the left and centre&nbsp;buildings.</p>

<p>The centre&nbsp;building consists of a florist on the ground floor. Above the entrance are a couple of roses indicating that it is in fact a florist. Inside are an assortment of plants and flowers to be sold and there is even a rack holding those well-known cone shaped flower bunches. The cashier&#39;s desk has another old cash register, and a plant inside a glass case. A parrot stand is beside the counter (which I think is another reference to the Pet Shop). The second floor is the photography studio with an incredibly built old style camera with adjustable legs. The camera is held in place by placing the rounded tripod feet onto some 1x1 vertical clip pieces. There is a white backdrop built into the wall where the shooting is obviously done, and a small shelf and portrait of a well-dressed gentleman, a shoutout&nbsp;to Town Hall where the same portrait is used. The roof is an outdoor barbeque pit with&nbsp;a table and chairs, cooking supplies, and grill. The building design is an obvious reference to the Parisian Restaurant.</p>

<p>The main floor of the rightmost building is the bakery with a glass display for some small pastries, a table displaying&nbsp;cupcakes and cookies, a shelf with two cakes and a croissant, and finally an enormous wedding cake complete with bride and groom at the top. At the corner of the bakery is an oven whose contents can be popped out as a play feature via a lever at the rear. The windows are actually made of garage door pieces and is secured using a combination of end clips and guiding the garage segments&#39; pegs along the holed studs of the technic bricks below. There is a pretzel piece on the front to provide indication that the shop is a bakery.&nbsp;The second floor is the dental office with&nbsp;newspaper, a postcard, and chairs in the waiting area. There is an actual dentist&#39;s chair complete with lamp, small sink, and operating equipment (a needle). Against the wall are a sink (built using&nbsp;window pieces and blue pane to ingeniously represent water), cupboard, and drawer with supplies. The window says &quot;Prevent Yellowing Dentist&quot; which is a clever reference to how white pieces turn yellow with age. The top floor is the AFOL&#39;s apartment complete with a small kitchen, folding couch/bed, bathroom, and a whole bunch of lego sets and train display. Above the couch is a shelf displaying minifigure scale versions of 10182 Cafe Corner, 10190 Market Street, and 10185 Green Grocer. On another shelf across the bathroom is a shelf displaying 10242 MINI&nbsp;Cooper MK VII and 10220 Volkswagen T1 Camper Van. There is a lego&nbsp;box with Cafe Corner as the set. In front of the window is 10181 Eiffel Tower. The train on the display is, I&#39;m assuming, a reference to 10233 Horizon Express. The&nbsp;track layout&nbsp;goes under a mountain through tunnels in a complete circuit around the table. The fact that the designers can squeeze that much detail into a minifigure&nbsp;scale LEGO&nbsp;display is nothing short of incredible.</p>

<p>The centre and right buildings are connected and each floor can be accessed&nbsp;through&nbsp;staircases located at the rear of the building. To get to the photography studio, dental office, apartment, and rooftop barbeque, it is necessary to first go through the bakery out back to the stairs. The bakery oven is in fact tucked under the first few steps which lead to the main staircase.</p>

<p>A fountain is located in the courtyard in front of the three buildings. The ground design takes full advantage of the use of corner tiles and even Nexo&nbsp;Knight shields around the fountain. The left building is actually attached to the others through two 1x6 arches and a&nbsp;4x6 grille piece.</p>

<p>It would be impossible to go into detail some of the amazing building techniques which have been used throughout. Perhaps my favourite&nbsp;is the use of Technic clamshell buckets and Thor&#39;s hammers for the centre&nbsp;building roof. Other building techniques I enjoy are the garage doors as windows and the designers&#39; treatment of the rounded corner bays on the right building. Also, the SNOT technique for the inverted dome uses <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-31561"">these</a>&nbsp;pieces to mount the component onto the holed studs of a couple 1x4 grooved bricks.</p>

<p>All pieces with decorations, including the cookies, candies, donuts, pies, dentist office window, cafe corner set box, newspaper, postcard, and portrait are printed with absolutely no stickers.</p>

<p>The price per piece ratio is 8.5 cents CAD/piece which is a darn good deal considering you get 4000 pieces. But kids, don&#39;t beg your parents to get this set anytime soon, because they will surely think it&#39;s a bite out of the wallet!&nbsp;Parents, however, go ahead and spoil yourselves, but be nice and share this gem with your kids!</p>

<p>To finally conclude this review, I want to iterate that this is a must have for any AFOL. I&#39;ve taken a long, hard look at my current city layout to see what I can do better with the current buildings I have, which were built back when I drew most of my designs from Town Jr./City sets. Obviously, slapping a 6x10 plate on top of 2 simple walls and full length windows in an open back design and passing that off as a building is unacceptable. The Assembly Square has inspired me to reinvent my city so that the buildings are more sophisticated and realistic. This is a process that can take years, but I have no doubt that LEGO over these years&nbsp;will carry forward with the modular line and continue to inspire and motivate all fans.</p>

<p>Also, I&#39;m incredibly disappointed with the last&nbsp;review. The low rating given was&nbsp;justified with&nbsp;trivial and irrelevant reasons. The tone is repetitive and it appears that the user is&nbsp;using the Assembly Square, out of convenience, to vent their melancholy. What a shame it is; but thank goodness that unhelpful reviews get the axe when the overall rating is calculated.</p>

"ickleb","2017-01-23T23:26:48.24Z","Hmmm","<p>Maybe life has been getting to me a little too much these days and Lego is losing it&#39;s magic to me but I can&#39;t help but feel disappointed with this set. It is a lovely set but there is something missing.</p>

<p>maybe I&#39;d have enjoyed it more if it the numbered bags didn&#39;t just reach 8, maybe it is that it has numbered bags and highlights every piece on every page, one of my true pleasures with Lego was playing spot the difference and the hunt through all the pieces. But that&#39;s been taken away as the world gets dumbed down.</p>

<p>but I think the disappointment lies with the it being just one module build, not like the pet shop which you could split but like the detective agency joined. It grates at me that the coffee shop windows look on to the wall end of the florists. It&#39;s strange that such a small thing as not being able to split them into 3 separate buildings disappoints me so much but there it is, I am disappointed. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Maybe you&#39;ll love this set but it has left me sad, or maybe it&#39;s just where my life has take me, taken me to a place&nbsp;that Lego does&nbsp;not bringing me the joy it once did.</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-05-04T11:23:35.323Z","That is a lot of building","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This is the first modular set I bought, and I am extremely pleased with that decision. Some 8,5 to 9 hours of building fun, with many clever techniques on display. That said, it nowhere comes close to the &#39;outlandish&#39; feel that I got when building Ninjago City. The construction sequence does a nice job of preventing one from the build becoming a drag, as does the addition of some details.There is a ton of detail fun, and lots to discover. Thanks to the manuals being online, one can&nbsp;spend quite a while looking for the references to the existing modulars. The set is also big - the minifigures that are included in the set simply vanish; it is a set that begs for the addition of more minifigures to bring it to life. Also, many of the techniques used can be used as an inspiration for one&#39;s own builds. Is the set worth it? Definitely, and not merely for the Price Per Part. This set is also worth it for the build itself, the design, the quality, the looks.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>This was a long build, spread out over three days. It in some ways is also the kind of build that can burn you out, especially building the top two floors, as there is a lot of repetition involved in the main structures. This was to me a big difference with Ninjago&nbsp;City, which is bigger (in parts count), but is built up with smaller substructures, each of them different. For Assembly Square, even more so than Ninjago&nbsp;City, my advise would be to build it in sections, rather than in one go (or build it with two people).</p>

<p>I enjoyed building the ground floor (as a whole section)&nbsp;the most. The&nbsp;designer(s) created all kinds of different patterns with the tiles, and all three structures (coffee shop, flower shop, bakery) differ a lot from each other, making for a lot of variation when building. To me the interior of the AFOL apartment was the most fun to build, and in general building the interiors was a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Some parts of the construction&nbsp;takes a bit of patience (like the shop windows for the bakery), but IMHO none of the construction is truly tricky. The greatest danger IMHO is not completing a step properly, and having to go back later.&nbsp;IMHO the technical build difficulty is limited, and I think there are few sequences that a 10 year old or even younger might have problems with. The sheer number of parts, and the large sequences of putting on the tiles (getting bored)&nbsp;are the things that could be the biggest problem for younger children.</p>

<p>As far as construction highlights, to me the bakery stands out, especially the display windows (with their tops) as well as the entry. There was IMHO a clever use of parts (the garage-door elements, the way the dome was reversed&nbsp;above the door are examples). Overall, I had a lot of fun building this set, and really enjoy the result.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are 9 minifigures included in this set, of which all but the baby are unique; however, it is probably more correct to say that the combination of legs, torso, head and hair is unique, as at least some of these elements have been used in other sets. The minifigures are put inside the various sections during the build, and fit nicely. Overall though, 9 minifigures&nbsp;are not nearly enough to give the impression of a populated inner city square (or inner city buildings).</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Overall, Assembly Square is a top notch build. The square, the small alley, the colours and building styles, it all combines for a very nice bit of Lego and an excellent scene. The various styles of building and the numerous details keep it interesting to look at.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of the theme, Assembly Square is nowhere near as outrageous as Ninjago City. Where Ninjago&nbsp;City had a lot crammed into it, the relative spaciousness of Assembly Square gives it a calm look. Still, one of the commonalities - to me at least - is that the designers seem to have made an effort to try and create as many different designs/construction techniques for an identical object. But even there the difference is that in Ninjago&nbsp;City it involves larger, more visible elements (the roofs of numerous substructures) while in&nbsp;Assembly Square it involves one of the details (the cash registers).</p>

<p>IMHO much of the charm of this set is that it is easy to imagine this being found in real life in a European town centre. As a result of the design, the fun little details of the set stand out more, for instance the different tile patterns (on the square and in the shops), the cornishes of the roofs, as well as the displays in the shop windows. &nbsp;The set as a whole also invites one to look at the references to the previous set. Some are obvious (Brick Bank and Parisian Restaurant), some are not (I am still looking for a clear&nbsp;Green Grocer reference, for instance). The structure above the coffee shop, IMHO is the weakest part of the whole set. IMHO the store for musical instruments in particular&nbsp;can be improved upon. It is almost as if not only the overall design of that block references the general looks of earlier sets, but also their lack of interior. The interiors of the right hand block (the one with the bakery) are IMHO the best.</p>

<p>The strength of this set is IMHO to be found in the details (the piano, the camera, etc.).</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This set is clearly a display set, as many of the play features are to be found in the interiors, and therefore simply are not accessible. However, the interiors offer a lot of room to pose minifigs in &#39;(inter)active&#39; poses. The front is clearly the &#39;best&#39; side, as goes for most sets in this theme. I do not feel that, unlike Ninjago City, it is meant for a full 360 degree display.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall I think this is a great set, and definitely worth the cost. It has great display value, and should offer hours of building fun. It also invites you to put in extra minifigures to populate this set. As it is, they simply &#39;disappear&#39; within the set. A set like this could easily fit in 20 minifigures without feeling crammed or overloaded with them. The designers have done a great job IMHO in breaking up the build in manageable parts and alternating building structure with building details to prevent boredom and tediousness creeping in for as much as possible. The interiors are great, and I can&nbsp;imagine displaying this set floor-by-floor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In some ways, due to size, subject matter and even the time&nbsp;they came out, this set begs comparison with Ninjago City.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some commonalities - the attention to detail, the overall quality and the quality of the interiors - yet there are also major differences, to the point where the sets are almost opposites.&nbsp;IMHO they are both excellent sets, and which one is the better one is mostly based on personal preferences. If you like more subdued,&nbsp;&#39;calm&#39; sets, than Assembly Square is the clear winner; if you like outrageousness and sensory overload, then nothing comes close to Ninjago&nbsp;City.&nbsp; I am in the lucky position to own both of them, and consider them each among the best on their own terms.</p>

"legomandre42082","2019-04-21T18:29:06.293Z","The Essence of Nostalgia for any Modular Building fan","<h2><strong>The Ideal symbol of any city:</strong></h2>

<p>I started my journey of constructing a Lego city a little over fifteen months ago. It began with the 2018 modular building Downtown Diner. I loved every aspect of this series of buildings and wanted all of them. My research of various buildings culminated in the discovery of the most eye-catching Lego set of all-time, Assembly Square. Something about this model told me that I needed to have this in my collection. Every part of the build felt timeless and effortless throughout the entire build. I was amazed at how many nostalgic ideas from the past twelve, now thirteen with the Corner Garage, were intricately placed throughout this ginormous model. There was no doubt in my mind during the entire eight hour build that I made the best purchase of my entire life. This set is so grandiose and will definitely attract any person observing one&#39;s city.</p>

<h2><strong>What I enjoyed about the set:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>As an homage to the success of the Creator Expert modular buildings, lead designer Jamie Berard threw in little Easter eggs, pun intended, of every other previous modular. I could go on for days about every detail, but I will explain the three that mean the most to my Lego journey.&nbsp;
	<ul>
		<li>The first and most striking component was the placement of a Cafe on the first floor of the left side building. The introduction of the Cafe pays tribute to the very first modular set 10182, Cafe Corner. Though the building was very bland on the inside, the ornate detailing on the outside brought many Lego fans into the revolutionary theme of Creator Expert. The iconic white and yellow awning on this model will make any fan nostalgic.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>My favorite modular building is the Detective&#39;s Office from 2015. The orangish-brown&nbsp;exterior and 1920&#39;s aesthetic made me hooked into the product. The model was the most fun I have had with a modular building and was revitalized with the exterior of the second and third story of the far right building of Assembly Square. Though it was a tedious process to complete, I felt so relaxed while completing this iconic detail. The models look incredible next to each other and help with the cohesion of the city.&nbsp;</li>
		<li>The final aspect of the model that I enjoy was the use of patio and staircases on the two right buildings. I currently own Parisian Restaurant and Downtown Diner and both of them have the stairs outside the model. This enabled the designers to introduce a much more detailed and spacious interior. With Assembly Square, The patio resembled the patio used in one of the Avenger&#39;s movies (I apologize but I do not remember the movie it is from) and it did not feel out of place in the bustling block. The use of outdoors stairs feel normal and typical of cities such as New York City or Harlem.&nbsp;</li>
	</ul>

	<li>The other aspect of the model I enjoyed was having three separate buildings in one model. Normally modular buildings have one maybe two buildings in the model. Even though there are three buildings, the level of detail is not cut from either building. The interiors are very spacious, especially with the blue building, and have enough space for future renovations, which I intend to complete. I love the various shops and living spaces throughout the space. This makes the model feel more complete and comfortable for any city.&nbsp;</li>

<h2><strong>What I disliked about the set:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>I was appalled at the multitude of bags used during the model. Even though there were six sections for the model, Lego could have easily gone for eight or nine segments for an easier process. The first three bags took forever to complete and only constructed and small portion of the entire block. After this, the entire set took less than three-and-a-half hours to build, compared to the four hours for bags one through three. I really did enjoy the entire process the construct but was mentally distraught at the crazy amount of bags needed fo the set.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Would I recommend this set:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Currently I own the Parisian Restaurant, Detective&#39;s Office, Assembly Square, and the Downtown Diner, so I can say I am very well-informed about modular buildings. I have understood the evolution of their design process and can legitimately state that this is the very best Lego Modular building of all-time. I am now confirming that this set is my favorite model of all-time. The set felt effortlessly to construct and made me happy throughout. It takes a lot for a set to be so nostalgic and this model did not disappoint in any terms. The model is enormous and should be displayed with pride. Though the price is extremely expensive, every penny is worth it. I bought this set on my birthday, which is today, and am very happy to have this in my collection. It was quite fun to build the model with the Rough Terrain Crane from Technic 2018. Any person invested in creating a Lego city or interested in architecture or loves large Lego sets should rush over to their local Lego store or Lego.com and purchase this breath-taking model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"indykid","2020-07-03T03:11:01.117Z","My new favorite modular","<p>Only my 5th modular set but this one is so versatile and has so many possibilities for play/display that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a leap to say it&#39;s the best, or at least the best one I own. Overall it&#39;s definitely a great set for the 10th anniversary of the modular buildings and has some really neat easter eggs/references to past sets including 2 big ones for Cafe Corner (my first modular set). It&#39;s definitely a very rewarding build. I built&nbsp;the first two bags in one night and finished the rest in an afternoon/evening.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first bag is largely the tiles that make up the sidewalk and ground floor store interiors. If you&#39;re detail obsessed like me it might take some extra time getting those 1x1 tiles looking perfectly aligned but the designs on the sidewalk look pretty elegant when completed. The 1x1 studded tiles are placed a bit randomly which provides some options for display.</p>

<p>Initially I was concerned that the few tiles holding the separate baseplates together would be too flimsy but after completing the second bag for the conjoined buildings on the right it holds together remarkably well. The detailing in the bakery and the florist shop are great, and there&#39;s enough extra tiles and pieces to have loose duplicates of all the smaller cookies and cupcakes from the bakery so minifigs can hold them without taking them off displays. The oven in the bakery has some nice brick detailing and a neat little function of pushing the cookie tray out for the baker to grab--this (and the obvious accessibility to the interiors) leads me to believe that LEGO designers are aiming for at least some playability when designing these sets contrary to what others have speculated&nbsp;about the modular series. The wedding cake is huge and nice little mini build. The windows made using the garage pieces were one of the standout details. After snapping together all the window pieces I wasn&#39;t quite sure how sturdy they would be but once the top frame of the window is put into place there&#39;s no wiggling, and&nbsp;they look great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The third bag builds the coffee shop (speculating that it&#39;s the same owner as the bottom floor of Cafe Corner due to the awning and spiral coffee signage) which has some great lamps on the wall and table and pie (!). The inside is&nbsp;spacious and a bit more accessible than the florist and bakery which have pretty high ceilings. I especially like the back door access and the uniqueness of the cash register which is different from the ones in the bakery and flower shop (and the music store upstairs). The color scheme inside is warm and cozy, reminiscent of a smaller mom and pop type place. I was eager to see how the corner door and coffee sign were built. The corner snaps in with a turntable that stays in place much better than Cafe Corner. The coffee sign is great homage to Cafe Corner&#39;s sign without recycling the design&nbsp;(it&#39;s a little smaller and simpler which adds to my belief that&nbsp;this is more of an ancillary&nbsp;storefront rather than the big flagship location of Cafe Corner). The tables and chairs are very sleek looking and I especially like the way the tables are fastened to the sidewalk with jumper plates.&nbsp;The very last part of this bag is building the flower facade for the florist which is fun and the grate that connects the coffee shop to the other building. It&#39;s pretty much impossible to access the door to the music shop without taking the grate off unless you have tiny hands but its not really a big deal.</p>

<p>The next bag is the dentist office and photography studio. They are accessible through a back staircase that leads from the bakery. This staircase is mimicked again outside the dentist office to provide access to the top level. The staircases are a little cramped for minifigs but it&#39;s not the end of the world.&nbsp;The instructions move back and forth between the dentist and photography studio in a way that keeps the build engaging. The details in the dentist office are all exquisite. The sink is an ingenious sideways window with a blue glass pane to indicate water. There&#39;s an abundance of tools for the dentist (there&#39;s an extra syringe and the club-looking thing that can be put into the drawers along with what the instructions indicate) and the pale mint green on the chair is a nice pop of color and one that seems pretty rare. The waiting area has a nice couch and a magazine rack and a tiny plant. The telephone looks a lot like the one from Pet Shop which is a nice nod to that set. The photo studio is less detailed and less spacious by comparison&nbsp;but the white glass panes on the windows for curtains is a fun detail and building the camera is one of the memorable mini builds. I have a soft spot for a lot of the vintage&nbsp;details in the modular sets--the jukebox in Downtown Diner was another favorite--which give a nice retro vibe to everything and matches the older architectural styles of the buildings. It does make the photographers hoodie seem a bit anachronistic but it&#39;s a small detail. I would have liked some more darkroom kind of things for photo development beyond the implied photo chemicals on the little table but the middle building is easily the smallest since it&#39;s the furthest from the edge of the sidewalk which makes interior space pretty limited. The camera is also quite large which doesn&#39;t help matters. The legs on the camera aren&#39;t as sturdy as some of the images on the box would have you believe when it&#39;s taken off the stand; they also stand awkwardly on any studded surfaces so if you&#39;re going to pose with the camera anywhere outside I would suggest the sidewalk.&nbsp;Building the tower corner of the dentist office was another memorable build. I really took my time making sure the slope tiles were all aligned perfectly. When it snaps into place it looks phenomenal.</p>

<p>The next bag is the music shop and dance studio. Their layouts are almost identical except the music shop has a turntable window with planter box&nbsp;on the corner while the dance studio has a door and small balcony. Years ago when I was a kid playing with LEGOs I built my own drum kit; honestly I&#39;m not particularly intuitive with MOC stuff especially when I was younger&nbsp;so I was surprised to see how&nbsp;the drum kit in this set was almost identical&nbsp;to what I had designed back then. The mirror is great and is held in place very simply but very well. The piano was a great mini build comparable to the camera. The 1x1 half circle tiles that make up part of the exterior detailing took some time to complete so they were all aligned. The rooftop is pretty simple and offers a nice skylight which helps with getting some natural light into the music studio. The detailing on the edge of the roof looks like a more elaborate take on the Grand Emporium rooftop style and works with the architecture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last bag is the studio apartment, rooftop terrace, and some odds and ends on the sidewalk below. Though there&#39;s a lot of repetition of the basic structure of the dentist office for the apartment, there&#39;s so much detail packed inside that the build never feels boring. The concurrent building of the rooftop terrace helps this as well. There&#39;s some interesting pieces used--some of which I had never seen before--to build the terrace. The technic scoops for the actual roof fit together very firmly, and the hammers that make up the facade trim was another great&nbsp;meticulous build for someone like me who enjoys making sure all the small pieces are aligned exactly. I thought the inclusion of the stick holder thing that apparently is LEGO&#39;s idea of tongs should have been supplemented with a hot dog or something to bring it together. The little flame under the grill and the dried out plant are fun details. The inside of the apartment really feels like a meta nod to LEGO fans and a painfully accurate depiction of the difficulties of displaying a LEGO collection when you have small living quarters.&nbsp;I didn&#39;t catch all the references to the sets that are replicated in micro form (though I did catch the Eiffel Tower and 3 modular buildings!) but they were a joy to build nonetheless. The fold out feature of the couch was clever and the kitchen has some nice detail (the cabinet and oven can be used to hold the extra pastries from the bakery). I&#39;ve never been particularly hurting for a minifig bathroom but I appreciate the realism of its inclusion (though there&#39;s no sink or shower) and I chuckled at the blue 1x1 tile&nbsp;at the bottom of the toilet bowl. My favorite part was definitely the micro Cafe Corner box (it was my first modular so it will always be special to me). The roof detailing is even more elaborate than the music/coffee shop, appropriate for the more outwardly detailed exterior of the dentist office/apartment. The last few bits in this bag are the lamp posts and fountain. The left lamp&nbsp;is placed by the coffee shop in such a way that it looks odd if there&#39;s anything besides a corner modular on the other side of the blue building otherwise the lamps will be too close together. The fountain is a great finish and is fairly sturdy. The translucent blue elements look great up against the white elements and the silver ball at the top really brings it all together.</p>

<p>There&#39;s 8 (plus baby) minifigs which gives you enough to put one in every room in the set--as the instructions will have you do. The baker is a little generic and looks very similar to the chef from Parisian restaurant, but the florist, music shop cashier, photographer, and AFOL arent specific enough to feel tied down to their respective rooms&nbsp;which is a plus in my opinion (realistically how many hours a day does the florist need to be open?). I like the baby minifig a lot--before it existed my MOC of a baby was just a generic smiling head on top of round 1x1 brick which has pretty ridiculous proportions; the baby minifig is a lot better. Not sure where the baby is supposed to sleep in the apartment and also it seems weird that they would have so many LEGOs with small pieces around a baby but it could just be quirky aunt taking the baby for the day or something. The carriage doesn&#39;t really have any obvious place to sit when not in use so it makes more sense to have the baby there. As I said I think the photographer&#39;s hoodie could be a bit anachronistic and this extends to the AFOL&#39;s outfit as well but this is a minor quibble.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, my quibbles are just that--quibbles. There&#39;s nothing wrong with this set.&nbsp;There&#39;s too much to love about it&nbsp;to get hung up on anything so trivial. The staircase in the back for access to the upper levels is a great way to allow for more interior space and I&#39;m glad LEGO followed this up with the exterior staircase for Downtown Diner. I hope they continue to experiment with this a bit more. The variety of pieces is also great; I&#39;m not an expert on availability/rarity of different pieces since I&#39;ve only gotten back into LEGO this year after a good eight or nine year hiatus but there was plenty of pieces I had not seen before and some very interesting colors like the sand blue, sand green, and the orangish brown of the dentist/apartment exterior and the purple and magenta for the flower shop&nbsp;awning. The color variety of the flowers for the flower shop and planter boxes was also impressive.&nbsp;I was waiting for this set to show up in the mail for over a month and I was not disappointed. In terms of price I feel like LEGO has gotten noticeably more expensive in the last ten or twelve years so I&#39;d say $279 is pricey (also good luck getting it on LEGO.com; it&#39;s been out of stock for quite a while which means they might be retiring it soon so scoop it up third party if you have to because its price is definitely going to go way up) considering it&#39;s ostensibly supposed to be 1 1/2 modulars. Modular&#39;s are usually $150-$170 range so it should be closer to $225-$245 in my opinion. Then again it&#39;s an anniversary set. I think childrens&#39;&nbsp;interest in these sets is entirely subjective considering I was into the early modulars and could build them with minimal hassle and no adult help (and enjoy some playability) at around ten or eleven. I would leave it up to the parent to know what their kid can handle and also whether they would even enjoy playing with it. I know plenty of people like to build them with their kids--usually ones younger than I was--which is a great work-around and if they get bored it can be a parents display piece.</p>

<p>I&#39;d absolutely&nbsp;recommend this set and if you&#39;re a modular fan/collector this one&#39;s pretty hard to beat. If you like long, semi-challenging, and definitely unique, clever, and engaging builds this one is also pretty hard to beat.</p>

"Sfish57","2020-10-19T01:29:51.287Z","The full 5 star package ","<p>One of the best sets I&#39;ve come across in a long while. My first modular building set and definitely won&#39;t be my last. Love the micro and macro details. Building the set is fun and each new section is different, even if some the structures are the same. Playability also high with all the little details in each room. Truly impressive. Also looks amazing as display piece. I appreciate the compactness of the build even with all the pieces.&nbsp;</p>
