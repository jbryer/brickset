<p>The Building Experience was awesome due to all the cars you get included. The pricing should&#39;ve been $10 less however. The parts are awesome. The playability is average as it comes from the cars, but Mack does offer a lot more playability compared to some other &quot;Cars&quot;&nbsp;sets.&nbsp;</p>
