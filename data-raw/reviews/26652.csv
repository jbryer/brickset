<p>Having accumulated rather an&nbsp;array of small police sets with various vehicles and crooks galore, we now have somewhere to process our prisoners put them on ice for the night, and complete the arrest paperwork.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong><br />
Large box, with the Police Station shown off in full on the front. As usual the back of the box shows off the various vehicles and play ideas for the completed build.</p>

<p>I was expecting the box to be half empty, but it actually appeared pretty full with the 10 bags of parts which make up the set. I think Lego could definitely find ways to reduce the amount of plastic waste generated by a single set, but that&rsquo;s another matter entirely from this review.</p>

<p>The set comes with a plastic bag containing the multiple instruction booklets: one for the motorcycle and crooks&rsquo; utility vehicle, one for the pursuit car, one for the chopper, one for the main station building, another for the garage and watchtower, and finally one for the cell block.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong><br />
There&rsquo;s some neat corner windows / door in blue frames (along with white connectors) which I haven&rsquo;t seen much of elsewhere. There&rsquo;s a few technic bits used to good effect here and there for such things as the pursuit car &ldquo;launcher&rdquo; (very cool), and to hold the upper floors in place, as well as joining the various sections of the station together. I also quite like the watchtower parts with the white framing and the black stairway, they are a bit out of the ordinary.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong><br />
Seven minifigures: three crooks and four police, plus the ubiquitous masked German Shepherd police dog.</p>

<p>The police force consists of a female chopper pilot and female pursuit driver (with a neat forage cap with ponytail underneath - she&#39;s very similar, possibly identical to the truck driver in 60140 bulldozer break-in), male motorbike cop, and male dog handler on guard in the watchtower.</p>

<p>The crooks include a female getaway driver (very similar or identical to bandit in 60139 mobile command centre), male inmate (with printed legs, and sweat beads on face), and male demolitions expert.</p>

<p>Pretty good overall balance of male to female minifigures, and I found it interesting that all the females are given driving roles.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong><br />
The build took me about an hour and a half the first time (without any &ldquo;assistance&rdquo; from my 3 or 5 year olds). &nbsp;It was largely pretty standard City fare, with a few quite interesting bits especially in the garage launcher and the wall explosion mechanism.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong><br />
The finished model is sharp, and has a great amount of playability, with a couple of gripes or areas for improvement that I will detail below.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bike is almost identical to the one in the mobile command centre set, with a couple of minor detailing differences. It does have a couple of grilles attached to the engine, so it appears to be a more powerful model with greater engine capacity.</p>

<p>The red utility vehicle with cherry picker is something a bit different to any vehicles I have yet seen. I like that there&rsquo;s somewhere to click the cherry picker bucket to for the safety of the guy in it while driving. It doesn&rsquo;t have anywhere to store the sticks of dynamite, so if the guy isn&rsquo;t holding them they are just kinda loose. The first time I tried to make him hold it he shaved a couple of flakes of red off too, so I&rsquo;m not all that keen on putting it in his hand and taking it out again too much.</p>

<p>The chopper is nothing too fancy, but I like that it is still a bit different to any other chopper I&rsquo;ve seen, with a series of technic connected bits for the tail. I guess there&rsquo;s only do much they can do with a basic chopper, but I do appreciate that it&rsquo;s different to the one in the bulldozer break-in set.</p>

<p>The pursuit car is neat, and looks very sporty. It&rsquo;s like the Dubai police force got involved with one of their supercars to make sure they catch the baddies, and with that launcher they can certainly get off to a good start.</p>

<p>The main station building is pretty sharp, with a public counter and prisoner processing area downstairs (complete with desktop, camera and height chart), and a nice ironic touch with a &ldquo;Welcome Home&rdquo; mat at the door to the cell block. The middle floor has a watercooler and another computer, and the door out to the catwalk over to the watchtower. The top floor is either the chiefs office or the detectives office, with another computer and a neat coffee filter machine. On the roof the helipad is perched over the edge of the cutaway to allow play access to the station.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier the garage has a launcher to get the pursuit started with a bang, and the watchtower is overhead with a slightly cramped computer workstation upstairs and the communication equipment on the roof. The catwalk connects the watchtower to the main station via two technic connectors at each end, and feels pretty secure. I also quite like the detailing with the yellow barrier arm under the catwalk.</p>

<p>One thing that is slightly frustrating is the height of the catwalk means that various other police sets are denied access to the imagined secure car park in back. My 7285 police dog unit can&rsquo;t fit, the truck from 60140 bulldozer break-in is also too large, and of course the 60139 mobile command centre doesn&rsquo;t have a chance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cell block is pretty cool all in all, with one cell each upstairs and downstairs, with a bed and a toilet behind a privacy wall, in full view of the outside world through the bars. The mechanism to blow the wall off is set in the floor between levels, and is very nifty. The upper cell also has a hidden storage space under the crooks bed, and there is a strange trapdoor between the levels which doesn&rsquo;t really have any explanation. It looks like a smugglers hole, but has no base so anything you put in just falls through.</p>

<p>The cell block is connected rather flimsily to the main station with just two technic connectors. Whole playing with my kids, I preferred to detach these two buildings as there was a lot of flex each time the station got pulled around, and I feared breakage of the connection.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong><br />
Overall I think this is a great set, and I&rsquo;m stoked to have a home for my Police force. Of my gripes the biggest is the flimsiness of the connection between cell block and the main station.&nbsp;<br />
The other things that could be better are having somewhere to store the dynamite, it would be neat if the mechanism to blow the wall off actually used the dynamite stick, it would be nice if the guy being rescued had somewhere to hold onto the getaway car, and it would be nice if the catwalk was taller to allow access for some of the larger vehicles from other police sets. Some explanation for the random trap door would be good too.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve heard others say that having the cell block on the outside is unrealistic, &nbsp;which is true, but it is that way for playability, and I think the dynamite wall is much more fun than the standard chain break-out (which also works if you bring a chain over from another set).</p>

<p>Lots of great play value here, and my kids and I will have lots of fun with it as I develop my city further and further.</p>

"Tristan_The_Lego_Lover","2023-02-07T19:01:41.883Z","One of the best Police Stations!","<p>The Police Station (60141) in my opinion is the best Police Station designed by Lego. This police station has a helicopter a police car 1 motorcycle 4 police officers with a canine and 3 robbers and a robber truck with a utility arm.&nbsp;The middle or main building consists of 3 floors i will start with the first floor. The first floor has a desk with a printed computer piece and a printed keypad piece beside the desk there&nbsp;is a camera in front of a mug shot station. There is also what appears to be a welcoming booth or something like that. The second floor has another office desk with printed pieces, and a water dispenser. The third floor has a third office desk with printed pieces and a coffee machine. And the top of the building has a helicopter&nbsp;pad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The jailhouse has 2 floors the first floor&nbsp;has 1 bed and a toilet and an open space in front of the jail door. The second floor has another bed and toilet. On the other side of a wall&nbsp; there is a trapdoor to get to the first floor. On the wall there are various drawings and markings including tic-tac-toe an escape plan and Roman numeral numbers counting the days.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building to the left consist of a one car garage then a&nbsp;platform on top of that has stairs leading to the chiefs&#39; office. The chiefs&#39;&nbsp;office is basically the same as the other offices with an office desk and a computer and keypad.&nbsp; And there is a bridge over a motorcycle bay that connects to the main building.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only negative that I can think of is there are to many stickers that&nbsp;go on the windows. Which are very annoying to put on.</p>
