"8BrickMario","2017-03-27T02:00:18.533Z","Mad about it? ","<p>So, gonna get this out of the way immediately. I got this set solely for the Dr. Quinzel minifigure. So how did the rest leave an impression on me?&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts in this set are mostly mundane, but the black quarter-dome and sloped quarter-circle bricks may be of interest. For any monochrome minifigure collectors, the statue of Amadeus&nbsp;Arkham&nbsp;(either that, or Asclepius, going by the snake- it&#39;s not clear)&nbsp;will be of note. The Spring Green door-insert&nbsp;walls are the only other unusual piece that comes to mind.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This is one set that seems tailored against minifigure collectors, as only two notable characters are exclusive. The villains are appropriately in prison garb, but their outfits are all pretty much identical and their heads and headgear are not exclusive- I would have expected a few customized touches- Two-Face&#39;s melting, Catwoman&#39;s being scratched, Ivy&#39;s having plants growing on it, Riddler with question marks, etc. That would make these feel more worth owning. This is the first appearance of Two-Face in the line, but he&#39;s getting his standard release in the summer, and when I get that set, I&#39;ll go more into detail on him, because he&#39;s really nice out of uniform.</p>

<p>There are two police officers provided, a male and a female, who help to fill out the scene, and Barbara Gordon in her civilian wear accompanies Batman and Robin.</p>

<p>Aaron Cash and Harleen Quinzel are the only 100% exclusive minifigures, and they&#39;re not exactly the most desirable characters for the target audience, are they? I imagine the set is supposed to be a villain pack for the kids who don&#39;t mind the prison garb. Cash is a nice minifigure, being an Arkham guard with a hook hand due to Killer Croc. He uses the African-American male hair debuted with Finn, and has a nice uniform, and two appropriately unhappy expressions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Quinzel makes her second appearance in a LEGO set here. Her hair is Abby Yates&#39;, which is closer than before, but the bun&#39;s too high. Her face is nice, with red cat-eye glasses that mirror Harley Quinn&#39;s mask, and her happy expression matches Nurse Harley&#39;s from the CMF series. Her other face is confused, so this set is either pre-Harley, or just full-time Quinzel. Her outfit is nice, with a red scarf and a&nbsp;doctor&#39;s coat over an argyle sweater (a clever way to sneak in her alter ego&#39;s diamond motif), and she has an ID badge on the bottom of the coat printed on her legs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing absolutely outstanding, but there are some nice techniques for the architecture- I like the ladders over the windows for bars, and the chair build in the office. The two wings of the building are understandably symmetrical, but don&#39;t feel too tedious.</p>

<h3>The finished model</h3>

<p>First built is a GCPD car, which is decent and all, but not as interesting as the inmate van from before. It seats two, but has a very low roof and it&#39;s a squeeze. It has an opening trunk for police gear, but one could always put dynamite in it instead...</p>

<p>I really really like the Asylum itself. It reminds me of both previous versions, having the color scheme of the 2006 version and the architectural flair of the 2013 version, while still feeling unique and like its own thing. The balcony in the front and central dome, and the telescope spires are nice, and I think the setting in winter, which adds &quot;snow&quot; all over the building adds additional interest. If one wanted, it could be defrosted with the removal and replacement of the white, but I like the idea. I like the statue in the front, and the barred windows, but the guard tower feels like a bit of a waste.</p>

<p>Inside the center of the building is a scanning machine, with a moving platform. Clever use of stickers means that as a figure is passed through the machine, their skeleton is visible on the panels on each side. Ivy doesn&#39;t fit due to her hair.&nbsp;There are some clever safety signs on the end, but they&#39;re secured very weakly. The machine is able to fit inside, but can be removed. Up above is a small office, with a computer and security tapes&nbsp;and a safe, and a door to the balcony.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two wings of the building do not actually attach- the axle pins on the side merely rest inside the Technic bricks on each side, so it doesn&#39;t stick together. This is frustrating, as I&#39;d like to move it all in one piece, but even if I replace the Technic bricks with axle bricks, the attachment isn&#39;t strong enough. More modification (like a second layer of attachments up above) would be needed to secure it.</p>

<p>The left wing (viewed from the front) contains a small laundry room with two washers and a broom, and two cells, for the Joker and Poison Ivy. Joker has a poster of Batman vandalized with his smile, and Ivy has a poster for &quot;The Plant Monster&quot;, a movie reference that utilizes the Series 14 minifigure of the same name as a visual. Both are stickers. Ivy&#39;s cell has plants growing on the outside.&nbsp;Up above, there are some catwalks with railings for moving around, which appear on each part of the building,&nbsp;and there&#39;s a medical office at the top, with a chair, some vials of chemicals, and a computer.</p>

<p>The right wing has a cafeteria buffet stocked with milk, orange juice, watermelon slices, cheese, sausages, and a pretzel, and some lunch trays.This can be stored in the empty space provided or taken out for play. The two cells on this side are for Two-Face and the Riddler- the former has a poignant campaign poster from his glory days, damaged on one side like he is in a fit of anger, and the Riddler, a poster of question marks. Up above is a call station with a window for inmates and visitors to talk to each other with the provided phones. This is likely a huge security risk, but the Asylum doesn&#39;t try too hard in that regard, as we all know.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The guard tower is mostly hollow, and looks nice, but doesn&#39;t really have a great place with the rest of the building. The watch room on top is completely empty and has no windows, which seems evident of parts padding. Inside the tower are some crates of TNT to be detonated and cause chaos, but I would have expected a tower-destruction play feature to go with this. There is none. On the bottom is a basketball hoop for recreation, but no ball.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some extras for the prison yard are also included- a four-seated table for villains to eat and conspire, and a weight bench, even though only one of the villains (Two-Face) might be likely to use it.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not exactly sure. I really love the presence and architecture of the building, but I&#39;m struck by how few play features they are- the set&#39;s really just a soundstage with more dollhouse-oriented play- which is fine, but I would have expected the least secure prison in comics to have actual breakout features rather than just implied ones- perhaps the movie explains this relatively calm tone. The 2013 one was a D2C, so that can be excused, but this is just a big playset that doesn&#39;t have very bombastic play value. I don&#39;t hate it at all, but I think this set is for people who really want the building for display, since the minifigure selection and play value isn&#39;t as engaging.</p>

"the_stud0218","2017-06-19T03:14:01.87Z","Crazy Good Value!","<p>As someone who isn&#39;t the biggest Superhero fan, I love TLBM sets and the movie was pretty good as well. When I first saw pictures of it, I wasn&#39;t sure if I was going to get it, due to the size and cost. Thanks to a great deal at Toys R Us (never thought I&#39;d say that before!), I relented and bought it. I was not disappointed! Starting with the minifigures:</p>

<p>Batman: Batman is pretty obligatory, considering the theme, but it&#39;s Batman: you can never have too many of him! He comes with the same face as the Joker Balloon Escape and the rest of the minifigure&nbsp;is the same as all the other TLBM Batmans. (Is that gramatically correct?) He comes with a Phantom Zone Projector, which was a major plot point in the film.</p>

<p>Robin: If I&#39;m not mistaken, his head prints are exclusive to this set. Pretty cool minifigure, very detailed. Just wish that not all the (non-Dimensions)&nbsp;Robin minifigures had that same squinting&nbsp;right eye, but that&#39;s just a nitpick.</p>

<p>Barbara Gordon: Very cool minifigure. Love her hairpiece and outfit, which was more prominent in the moviethan her Batgirl outfit oddly enough.</p>

<p>Dr. Harleen Quinzel: Very detailed minifigure. Love the look of her.</p>

<p>Aaron Cash: Pretty obscure character, but cool nonetheless. Nice detailing.</p>

<p>GCPD&nbsp;Officer (Male): Nice generic, licensed police officer. Just wish he had leg printing.</p>

<p>GCPD Officer (Female): Another nice generic police officer. Again, just wish she had leg printing.</p>

<p>Arkham Asylum Joker: Probably my least favorite minifigure of the set. Comes in the CMF series, thus none of him is exclusive, as his head comes in at least three other sets/polybags.</p>

<p>AA Two Face: Love it. I like the minifigure especially because, well it&#39;s Billy Dee Williams, but also how the other side of his hair is kind of like melted plastic.</p>

<p>AA Poison Ivy: Love the look of TLBM&nbsp;Poison&nbsp;Ivy and since I don&#39;t really have any interest in the Scuttler, now I can get her great hair piece and face prints.</p>

<p>AA Riddler: Love his hair/hat combo. Not much else to say about him.</p>

<p>AA Catwoman: I like her orange belt, but again not much else to say about her.</p>

<p>Statue: Not sure if this counts, but in front of the main doors is a solid grey minifigure&nbsp;statue, which uses Peter Venkman&#39;s hair piece in light grey. This statue&nbsp;also holds a grey snake. Pretty cool addition to the set, if you ask me.</p>

<p>Side Builds:</p>

<p>I love that police car! Looks so old fashioned and unique. I like it more than any City police car. The X-Ray screening part is so ingeniously put together, just wish there was less stickers. The cafeteria lunch line&nbsp;was one of my favorite parts of the set, based on pictures, and while it looks cool, I was kinda disappointed by how easily everything falls out. The eating table&nbsp;isn&#39;t anything special, but I like the colors they use. Last but not least is the weight lifting bench, which comes with two small dumbells. Funny inclusion, but isn&#39;t anything to write home about.</p>

<p>Main Build:</p>

<p>Now onto the main part of the set!</p>

<p>Arkham Asylum (exterior):&nbsp;the mucho&nbsp;grande of the set, Arkham&nbsp;Asylum looks great inside and out. I love the builds for the cell windows and how Poison Ivy&#39;s cell has vines growing outside of it. Like the white elements that imply fallen snow and the use of the grey scope pieces on the roof. While I don&#39;t really like big,&nbsp;specialized pieces, I love how they&#39;re used on the top of the roof. Their is also a balcony, with a door&nbsp;which leads into the next section of my review...</p>

<p>Arkham Asylum (interior): the top level includes just a single room. It is has&nbsp;a computer set, complete with a donut! It also has&nbsp;a cabinet&nbsp;with a carton of OJ and two&nbsp;of&nbsp;the old security tape print on the top. There is also a door that leads out to the previously mentioned balcony. The level below this has two rooms and an excellent catwalk on both sides. On the left side, there&#39;s a room for people to talk to inmates via telephone pieces. Simple build, but I really like it and the colors used. The other room on this floor is Harleen Quinzel&#39;s&nbsp;office. Nothing too special, but it stills looks good. Like the build for the chair, instead of just using a plain&nbsp;chair. Also like the colorful vials of liquids, as well as the lime green syringes. Now onto the bottom floor, there are four cells and two&nbsp;cells. Going from left to right, there is the cafeteria area, where you put the aforementioned lunch line, complete with trays, plates, pretzels, sausages, cheese slices, watermelon slices (on the new quarter round tile plate), another donut, another OJ carton, and two cartons of milk. Next are&nbsp;four cells for Poison Ivy, Joker, Two Face, and Riddler. While it&#39;s odd that there isn&#39;t a cell for Catwoman, that&#39;s alright, as there wasn&#39;t room for it anyway. Lastly is the washing room, which is, in my opinion, the best room of the whole building. I love the builds of the washing machines, even though I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re the same as the ones found in the Creator Modular Brick Bank. Love the Washing Powder box!</p>

<p>Watchtower: Last but not least is the watchtower. While it&#39;s a bit too thin, it&#39;s fine and I really like the basketball hoop. (Though&#39;s it&#39;s odd that they don&#39;t include a basketball, but it makes sense as the basketball piece would be too big for the hoop.) I like the TNT as well, but wish that it was a print.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The whole Asylum connects together via Technic pins and while it can make moving the whole thing around irritating, I like it, as it makes it easier to seperate each area and turn them&nbsp;around to see the interior.</p>

<p>Conclusion: This set is probably now in my Top 10 Favorite Sets of all time. That&#39;s saying something as I just built it today and have gotten many sets over the years! It&#39;s definetly my favorite TLBM set and is so far my favorite set of 2017, though I don&#39;t have too many sets from this year yet. The exterior&nbsp;is excellent. The interior&nbsp;is a bit lacking in some areas, but that won&#39;t be on display as much, so that&#39;s alright. The minifigure selection is great,&nbsp;there is some really neat building techniques, and is an excellent&nbsp;part pack. I give it a solid 9.5/10. If you&#39;re a Lego Batman Movie fan, this is one of the best sets in the&nbsp;whole line.&nbsp;If you&#39;re a superhero fan, I wouldn&#39;t let the fact that it&#39;s a Lego Batman Movie set put you off from buying this. If you&#39;re neither, I still recomend it,&nbsp;as it&#39;s a great building. In conclusion, this set is a crazy good value. (Pun totally intended.)</p>

"masterit","2017-12-31T03:06:04.68Z","70912","<p>This set has 12 minifigures. The police car build is unique, the lego pieces are &quot;very&quot; uncommon (the food pieces in particular) and you get 5 of&nbsp;Batman&#39;s rouges in prison jumpsuit&#39;s along with a detailed build of Arkham Asylum. The weakest build is the tower build with the basketball hoop (it is easy to knock over intentionally &amp; unintentionally alike). In my opinion, the rest of the build is very well done.</p>
