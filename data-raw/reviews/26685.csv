<p>Packaging / Instructions<br />
The set is packed in a plastic bag, for single use. There are 2 instructions in the magazine: one for building a falcon and one for attaching to Ekimu&#39;s shoulder.</p>

<p>Minifigs<br />
There are no minifigs included, so I&#39;ll go straight to the parts.</p>

<p>Parts<br />
There are a lot of Technic parts here, as befits a Bionicle set, but the highlight of the set are the golden parts: beautiful wings, tail and beak.</p>

<p>Overall<br />
This is a great LEGO bird design. As a big Chima fan, I took it because of some similarities to eagles and phoenixes. The set has a feature to attach a falcon on the arm of the Mask Maker, which unfortunately I couldn&#39;t test, but I think is cool. It is great both as an addition to the #71312 and as a standalone display model.</p>
