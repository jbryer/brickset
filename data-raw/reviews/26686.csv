"sube82","2016-11-16T01:08:04.953Z","My 1st 'modern' set","<p>This is my first &quot;up to date&quot; LEGO set since 1995 (!!!) Before this I only bought second-hand sets from the 80&#39;s and early 90&#39;s since it is still relevant with my childhood. (I actually bought the German National Football team Minifigs some months ago, but I didn&#39;t count it as a real set.&nbsp;<br />
I&#39;ve never build any LEGO set above 1995 and I was quite surprised how Lego had developed so much since then. So this review will not be just about the 21306 in particular but will also review a bit about the LEGO development in general.</p>

<p>The Packaging<br />
It&#39;s very nice and not to big, combine the set with pictures and decoration from the original movie, inside and outside the box. The bricks are separated to different bags in accordance with building step. It&#39;s very good thing, specially when a set contains many parts. The Instructions is pretty thick and included some stories about the design and the original movie that inspired it.</p>

<p>The Model<br />
As a Beatles fan I must say that I&#39;m very satisfied with the model. The look, the shape, the details and the colors from the outside couldn&#39;t be better than this.&nbsp;<br />
It represented the original Yellow Submarine very well. LEGO has developed lots of new parts that are very helpful to give more possibilities in creating something. Although I&#39;m a fan of the 80&#39;s simplicity I must say this is a very positive thing from LEGO. The top of the submarine can be opened and then you&#39;ll have the interior.</p>

<p>The Interior&nbsp;<br />
There is a main room for the crew, it&#39;s not too big but it holds the four Beatles Minifigs and has nice details and lots of decorated bricks. There is a time board, a Monitor, Navigation Board, lots of control tools, all printed to the bricks. I really appreciated this since I hate Stickers. There is also a small room on the back to store the Minifigs&#39;s accessories.</p>

<p>The Minifigs<br />
For years I&#39;ve been dreaming for having a Beatles Minifigs and now the dream come true! Again, they did a great job here. John, Paul, George and Ringo just as they look in the original movie, each with a object like the one they hold at the end of the film. John has a binoculars, Paul has the word &#39;Love&#39;, George has the submarine&#39;s motor and Ringo has a half hole. You can place them inside the Yellow Submarine, or you can display them on a display stand. Beside the Fab Four you also get the &#39;Nowhere Man&#39; Jeremy Hillary Boob which is also nice. Well actually it could be much better had they also included Captain Old Fred since he was also a main crew from the Yellow Submarine. Perhaps an Idea for a next Collectible Minifigs line? Captain Old Fred, the Blue Meanies, Max, Pepperland&#39;s Lord Major, the&nbsp;Fab Four in Sgt. Pepper uniform, etc.</p>

<p>The Construction<br />
The model has a very steady construction. No parts fall easily. The development of new parts over the years also helped to created a more steady constructions.</p>

<p>Building Experience<br />
I must say that I don&#39;t get a real challenge in builds this model. It&#39;s too easy, perhaps also because of the Instructions. You only add 1-5 parts per step. So for a 500+ parts set you&#39;ll need up to 100 step! For an old-school LEGO fan I found it very slowly and boring. It also reduce the challenge in build something. You don&#39;t need to think and watch the Instructions very clear fully anymore. Now that&#39;s one thing that I found not that positive from the LEGO development.<br />
The real challenge in build this set for me is the colors. Like parts, LEGO also developed many range of colors that you won&#39;t find in the 80&#39;s sets. Of course it&#39;s nice and give more possibilities in creation, but for a partial color blind like me, I found it very frustrated to divide the colors that look similar, like Yellow and Orange in this case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over all I give this set 9,5 of 10. And a high appreciation to the LEGO development.</p>

"wildwill","2017-01-22T22:46:56.417Z","All You Need is Love, Love, Love is All You Need","<p>Ever since this set was announced I longed to own it. &nbsp;I was born in 1971 and my late Father, as well as my Mom and both Uncles, were huge Beatles fans, so I grew up listening to every American album on vinyl (except Meet the Beatles which my Dad hated). &nbsp;My Mom would always brag that she got to see them at the Hollywood Bowl TWICE, and even still had the programs. &nbsp;The only time I can remember my Dad crying was in 1980 when John was murdered. &nbsp;To say that I grew up with the Beatles is an understatement. &nbsp;The 1968 animated film was always on our TV whenever it showed up in the local listings, and when it was finally was released in 1987 on VHS I quickly bought it &nbsp;In fact it was the only movie I really wanted to watch the first time I ever did a psychedelic substance. &nbsp;Now that I&#39;m a parent myself, I had to expose my kiddo to the classic film, and found that she quickly developed a love for it as well, and she knows all the songs by heart too. &nbsp;When the set was released a couple of months ago I couldn&#39;t afford it, but knowing that the holidays and my Birthday was coming up, I put it on my wish list, after all last year I got the Dr. Who Ideas kit for my 45th birthday. &nbsp;Why not make it an annual tradition? &nbsp;My Mom certainly came through this year, as it was just delivered a couple of hours ago, and it&#39;s now been built and is on display.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1) Box - The box is a thing of beauty, well designed with graphics on the inside and out. &nbsp;It&#39;s reusable and collector friendly. &nbsp;5/5</p>

<p>2) Minifigures - They don&#39;t get much better than this. &nbsp;You know the only thing that would make this set better would be the inclusion of a Blue Meanie or two. &nbsp;K&#39;Nex&#39;s terrible set from several years ago came with Meanies, I guess I might have to track those down. &nbsp;Yuck. &nbsp;In any case, as others have pointed out these are all brand new prints with double sided painting and dual face heads. &nbsp;Each has an accessory, John&#39;s got a spyglass, Paul has a printed &quot;Love&quot; tile, George has the engine for the sub and Ringo has a hole. &nbsp;Of course Jeremy Hillary Boob aka The Nowhere Man is also included and he&#39;s got a great whimisical expression, his little tail and a green Apple accessory. &nbsp;5/5</p>

<p>3) Build&nbsp;- Each baggie builds on the last, and really that&#39;s the way to go these days. &nbsp;It&#39;s really straightforward and nothing too complicated. &nbsp;Some of the tiny slopes are tough to put in for my ham-fingers, but my 10 year old helped. &nbsp;They also include some 20+ extra parts, including a second printed clock piece for the inside (think &quot;When I&#39;m 64&quot;). &nbsp;The printed tiles are fantastic as well, with so many details including the 1x1 round tiles, both in trans pink and opaque pink with tampo on them for the control dials, it&#39;s a marvelously designed piece. &nbsp;If I had ONE nit-pick I&#39;d say it was using the red arched tube pieces for the top railing around the pipes. &nbsp;I&#39;d probably swap that out with red tubing ala the tube piece for the Ideas Ecto-1. &nbsp;Otherwise the finished product is an incredible piece, both to swoosh and to display. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The top comes off so you can put the Beatles inside, the engine compartment opens and you can put the green engine piece from George inside. &nbsp;The tail section is articulated as are the pipes. &nbsp;The cloud themed brick built base is awesome, though I think I would have liked an ocean based one instead. &nbsp;In either case I can&#39;t fit the sub on the base in my chosen display case, so I just removed it. &nbsp;The sub stands beautifully on it&#39;s own. &nbsp;I also had to remove one section of the pipes (and stored it in the engine compartment) because the case was too small. &nbsp;The finished model on the stand is quite high. &nbsp;Rating 5/5</p>

<p>4) Playability - It&#39;s a submarine, need I say more? &nbsp;Swooshing commenced as soon as it was done. &nbsp;There might have been some singing too. &nbsp;It would be awesome if there was a spot for Jeremy in the sub, but oh well. &nbsp;It also would have been great to have Old Fred too, and as I previously mentioned, I need some Blue Meanies. Rating 5/5</p>

<p>5) Price - Here&#39;s where I will give the set a hit. &nbsp;It&#39;s $60 at retail. &nbsp;Of course the first time I saw it was in a specialty toy store where they tacked on another $20. &nbsp;At just under 11 cents per piece, it&#39;s more expensive per piece than all the other Licensed kits except for the Big Bang Theory. &nbsp;This is the same price as the Dr. Who kit, though that one has almost 75 more pieces (most of which are used to make the terrible Brick Built Daleks). &nbsp;Rating 4/5</p>

<p>Overall I give this set a big old 5 stars and it&#39;s highly recommended. &nbsp;Unless you just hate the Beatles, and then you can give it a skip. &nbsp;Otherwise I think it&#39;s a huge step forward for Ideas. &nbsp;I&#39;d really like to see a second set of Blue Meanies, maybe with some of the Snapping Turks, the Apple Bonkers and various Meanies, and a brick built Flying Glove? &nbsp;</p>

"Jerreke","2017-06-04T20:39:44.563Z","The colour scheme of this set makes it worthy to buy","<p>A couple of days ago, 3th of june&nbsp;2017, I entered the Lego Shop in Belgium. It&#39;s located in a large mall in Wijnegem.</p>

<p>I was there to buy the Lego Saturn 5 rocket, but spotted this neat little box. I couldn&#39;t resist. Back home i started building the kit and making some video&#39;s inbetween.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box: packaging, style</strong></p>

<p>The box is sturdy and opens on top, no side-opening box here. Inside the box there are nice details coming out of the animation-movie. Really nice detail here. The front contains the overall model, the back of the box shows some features of the model.</p>

<p>Inside the box are 5 plastic bags and a book containing the history of the model and the building instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Building the model</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve made a quick link to my build published on YouTube.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://youtu.be/6pEMuOF4y50"">Link to the build of my model</a></strong></p>

<p>The build was uneventfull, nice details are the bricks with printed details. No stickers, YAY.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>5 minifigs are included, the 4 Beatles and Jeremy, a sidekick from the movie. All minifigs&nbsp;are holding an item in hand referring to the movie or music.</p>

<p><strong>Final conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Fantastic model, nice colours, nice minifigs, nice box, highly displayable...</p>

"Schmoobin","2016-12-26T03:37:08.347Z","Full speed ahead Mr. Boatswain, full speed ahead!","<p>First off, I&#39;ve always been a HUGE fan of The Beatles, and I have listened to all of their songs. &nbsp;Once I found out that this was going to be a Lego set, I was thrilled! &nbsp;I couldn&#39;t wait to get this set for Christmas, and now, I have it sitting next to me on display while I write this down.</p>

<p><strong>Box / Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box is absolutely remarkable! &nbsp;The box is one of those that you can open and reopen without damage. &nbsp;At first, the box appeared a little bit too small for a model like this, but then again, the model itself was smaller than I expected. &nbsp;The wonderful Beatles designs on the outside blends in nicely with the black interior of the box. &nbsp;On the front of the box, you have a nice picture of the completed models with the minifigures. &nbsp;The back side shows you some of the cool things you can do with this particular set, like any other box nowadays. &nbsp;The only problem I had with it was that the box was the teeniest&nbsp;bit crinkled on a corner, but it was probably only bad shipping.</p>

<p>The instructions are put in a slim bag nicely so it doesn&#39;t get wrinkled. &nbsp;It comes with about 150 pages total, and everything is sealed nicely with the perfect bind system. &nbsp;Of course, before the actual building steps, you get the story about the yellow submarine.&nbsp; After the steps, you get information on the original model and the creator behind it, Kevin Szeto.</p>

<p>The set came with no stickers :D</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>First of all, there are no brand new pieces specifically made for this set because that is considered illegal for Lego Ideas. &nbsp;Other than that, you had many pieces that were printed a certain color for the first time, just new pieces from 2016, and exclusive prints on some of the pieces. &nbsp;The mold&nbsp;for Jeremy Hillary Boob is a nice touch, though not exclusive, since it was originally&nbsp;used for the scurriers in the Nexo Knights theme.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The minifigures are probably the best part of the set. &nbsp;Who doesn&#39;t want minifigures of John, Paul, George and Ringo? &nbsp;The minifigures&nbsp;resemble the original Yellow Submarine cartoon characters quite well, using exclusive prints, double printed legs, and special tools. &nbsp;They also have double printed heads, in which one side shows a regular, neutral smile, while the other sides are more goofy smiles.</p>

<p>John Lennon: &nbsp;The creators did a good job replicating his clothes quite well. &nbsp;I quite like the double printed legs on him. &nbsp;He also comes with his trademark goofy smile. &nbsp;Plus, he comes with a telescope, or binoculars, as some people said.</p>

<p>Paul McCartney: This is also a good representation of the source material. &nbsp;The hair piece looks quite nice, despite the fact that it is probably the oldest head mold in Lego history. &nbsp;He also comes with a good print pattern and double printed legs. &nbsp;The sign that he holds spells out &quot;LOVE&quot; &nbsp;which I think is a clever reference.</p>

<p>George Harrison: &nbsp;Ah, good ol&#39; Gerogie. &nbsp;His hair piece is new, and it looks very nice and closely resembles the source material. &nbsp;The clothing choice is somewhat casual but still very accurate to the movie. &nbsp;He appears to be holding the remote to the submarine.</p>

<p>Ringo&nbsp;Starr: &nbsp;Who could forget about Ringo? &nbsp;He comes with a nice, print on his body, and side prints on his legs. &nbsp;The hair seems to be accurate, originally painted&nbsp;in a ginger color for Ron Weasely. &nbsp;He seems to be holding a circular object of which I am not sure of what it actually is.</p>

<p>Jeremy Hillary Boob: &nbsp;The Nowhere Man is represented quite well using a scurrier mold. &nbsp;It comes with a nice printing for the face, and to top it all off, a nice, pink tail!</p>

<p><strong>Construction</strong></p>

<p>Bag 1: &nbsp;This bag is where you construct the base for the minifigures, and John Lennon himself. &nbsp;Then you start to build&nbsp;the base of the submarine. &nbsp;The base is already very smooth by the time we are done with the first bag. &nbsp;Some SNOT bricks have been built up, which will be used later in the build &nbsp;</p>

<p>Bag 2: &nbsp;We get to make Paul McCartney! &nbsp;After that, we start to use SNOT techniques to create the smooth, round shape of the base. &nbsp;We then start to work our way inside, giving a little bit of detail to the sitting room. &nbsp;So far we have a steering wheel, a seat for whoever would like to drive (give Ringo a chance, just once) and we have decorated it somewhat with nice, 1x1 circular printed pieces.</p>

<p>Bag 3: &nbsp;George Harrison has been built! &nbsp;Now is when we actually start to build upwards. &nbsp;We finish off the inside with some extra details to then work on the outside of the submarine. &nbsp;The nose, and parts of the tail are now in place, along with thin, flat plates that will be important for the next bag.</p>

<p>Bag 4: &nbsp;Finally we have Ringo Starr! &nbsp;We finish off the tail and main body. &nbsp;There are also little, red propeller pieces which look very nice! &nbsp;Now, we start to build the tower. &nbsp;Because of the flat tiles, this part ends up being removable to place the minifigures inside.</p>

<p>Bag 5: &nbsp;Aw, we can&#39;t forget about the Nowhere Man! &nbsp;We finish off the tower&nbsp;with nice slopes, printed pieces, and the periscopes! &nbsp;Of course, a lot of people like how sausage pieces form handrails, and I like that too! &nbsp;Then the main vessel is constructed, and all we have to build now is a cloudy stand, which looks great! &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>The set resembles the Yellow Submarine in every way! &nbsp;I love all the sleek and smooth pieces to give it a round appearance. &nbsp;The tower can be taken off so you can put the wonderful minifigures inside the submarine to ride around the depths of the ocean! &nbsp;I like the addition of a small space in the tail to put the accessories in. &nbsp;On display, it just looks truly brilliant.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Never has such a thing caught my eye before! &nbsp;Of course, I&#39;m a huge Beatles fan, and when I saw this, I immediately new this was the set for me. &nbsp;Now that I&#39;m done building it, I think it is the most &quot;me&quot; set that I have ever built. &nbsp;Although there are some play features to this set, this is a display piece and will forever be the display piece. &nbsp;Of course, I will keep the box, the instructions, and heck, even the spare pieces! &nbsp;I absolutely love this set, so I&#39;ll give it a 5/5</p>

<p>Wait a second, what is this? &nbsp;Could it be? &nbsp;Oh my gosh, is is! &nbsp;This set comes with the most brilliant invention ever invented by man... the brick separator! &nbsp;Just because of that, I&#39;m shooting up my score to a 8/5.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-08-08T05:24:42.523Z","Best Lego Set for a Beatles Fan","<p>This set is obviously designed for Beatles fans, and if you are also a Lego fan then it is pretty much a no brainer. When compared to other Beatles collectibles it is very reasonably priced and is a very unique piece to add to your Beatles collection. The Beatles minifigures are fantastic and very easily recognizable. The Yellow Submarine is just as well designed as any other Yellow Submarines (Corgi) you will find on the market, which is pretty amazing given it was limited to only existing Lego bricks. There is no question that it is much cooler than a lunchbox.&nbsp;Certainly the Yellow Submarine is the most iconic image of the Beatles you could create in&nbsp;Legos, and this set does a fantastic job of portraying it.</p>

<p>As for the Lego set itself, the build is relatively straight forward but I did learn a few thing from it. However, the level of detail is amazing, both on the outside of the sub as well as the inside. It floats over clouds which definitely makes for a very appropriate base.</p>

<p>It is definitely a set that offers a lot of playability, however, that playability kind of gets lost when you consider it a Beatles collectible. The instructions and box only add to the collectibility of this set.</p>

<p>I do find it a little odd that the 5th figure is Jeremy, certainly Blue Meanies play a much larger role in the movie and having bad guys would increase the playability of the set. Of course this set would be even better as the first in a series of sets based on the movie, after all, how cool would it be to have an entire&nbsp;Lego Pepperland on display.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I highly recommend this set for any Beatles fan. Even my wife agreed that this was something that I had to have (and she hates the idea of collectibles and having more stuff&nbsp;in the house).&nbsp;The only thing better than this&nbsp;would be if you could get your hands on a Butcher cover. This set&nbsp;is the&nbsp;perfect compliment to a framed cel I have from the movie showing the Fab Four alongside Jeremy in the Sea of Holes. I couldn&rsquo;t be any happier with my purchase.&nbsp;</p>

"indykid","2020-06-18T02:47:52.603Z","Got this as a gift","<p>I watched Yellow Submarine with my siblings all the time as a little kid and the Songtrack was probably the first CD I remember owning. We would sing it in the car with our mom. Later when I finally started listening to music in middle school I went to through a very long serious Beatles phase (coincided with the tail end of my childhood interest in LEGOs) so I always wanted a Beatles LEGO set but never expected it would be real!</p>

<p>A few years ago my mom bought me this set for my birthday and it&#39;s a great set! It had been a while since I&#39;d built any LEGOs let alone anything this substantial but it was a pretty straightforward build. There&#39;s a lot of cool pieces with animation printed from the movie which makes this set feel very special, along with the detail given to the actual band members. A lot of pieces in yellow and orange that I hadn&#39;t seen before. There&#39;s plenty of extras of the cool printed pieces so you can do something unique when them to modify other sets or use them for something new. The submarine opens up and has a lot of gorgeous recreations of the controls from the movie. The Beatles can all sit inside the submarine and the engine, LOVE tile, telescope, and hole can all fit into a small compartment by the rudder. Jeremy is super cool and I love his tail. It&#39;s a bit of a bummer that he can&#39;t fit inside the submarine though he has a spot on the submarine display while the band has their own neat little&nbsp;display stand with a Yellow Submarine 2x4 tile. The clouds on the submarine display stand remind me of the artwork they rolled out for Beatles Rockband years ago. The band all have two face options--a smile/smirk and bigger smile. Jeremy has a green apple.</p>

<p>This is mostly a display piece hence the stand and the very fancy box that slides out instead of folding over. There&#39;s still definitely some playability though. The level of detail makes it clear that it was lovingly crafted by its designers and will be appreciated and beloved by Beatles fans and especially LEGO and Beatles fans. A bit pricey considering it&#39;s size but I&#39;m sure the Beatles brand factored into that--then again it was a gift so it didn&#39;t affect me. Plus since this is only available 3rd party now I&#39;m sure it&#39;s only gotten more expensive but I wish anyone the best of luck finding one cheap!</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious why the Yellow Submarine was the Beatles set they went for since it&#39;s easily the most recognizable image of the band and the best entry point for kids but I&#39;m still holding out hope they do a Beatles set from their pop era, perhaps a Beatles concert piece with the stages from the Cavern Club, Ed Sullivan, and Shea Stadium/Budokan/Candlestick Park maybe even their final rooftop concert? Not likely but one can dream!</p>

"HeadFax","2020-08-01T00:42:15.99Z","All together now!","<p>I&#39;m not going to bury the lede here. This set is brilliant. Sublime. Practically perfect in every way.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a lifelong Beatles fan, and the thought of their music intersecting with Lego brings joy to my heart. I first saw this set sitting on the shelf in a store, and at the time I genuinely didn&#39;t know what to make of it. I had been on a decades-long hiatus from Lego, and I didn&#39;t know anything about the Ideas products, so I didn&#39;t really understand what I was seeing. But the set, in all its colorful glory, practically leaped&nbsp;off the shelves into my hands.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t end up buying one until several months later, but I am immensely glad I did. The set is simply gorgeous. The bright, vivid colors are so uniquely cartoonish that it feels&nbsp;very much like a piece of the animated film is sitting on my bookcase. The detail on the submarine, both interior and exterior, is exquisite. The minifigures bear such a remarkable resemblance to their feature film counterparts that it&#39;s impossible to mistake them for anyone else.</p>

<p>But what I really want to highlight here is the building experience. The set was very fulfilling to build. I don&#39;t know if it was because I was unfamiliar with a lot of modern Lego building techniques, but it felt both straightforward and complex in all the right ways. I was most impressed by the SNOT techniques employed to construct the sub&#39;s sail/conning tower. It was a nice departure from the horizontal layer technique used in the sub&#39;s body, and yet the two parts blend together almost seamlessly.</p>

<p>Once constructed, the set is also fun to fiddle around with. The conning tower is removable, and the interior boasts enough room to seat all four Beatles inside (although not Jeremy...poor, poor Jeremy). There&#39;s also a removable section immediately aft of the main cabin where you can store the various knick-knacks that the minifigs come with.</p>

<p>Anyway, in conclusion, this set is a must for any Beatles fan, especially those who have any fondness for the original Yellow Submarine film. This set is a wonderful homage to the band, and is a worthy part of their legacy.</p>
