"alfredotwo","2017-06-07T06:41:03.92Z","We Choose to go to the Moon","<p>This 1969 piece NASA Apollo Saturn V Rocket is, by far, Lego&#39;s greatest creation (even if most of the credit goes to its brilliant fan designers). It is a genuinely stunning model of the famed rocket ship, offering a delightful build experience at very reasonable price.</p>

<p><strong><u>The Build</u></strong></p>

<p>I constructed the set in about 3 hours, which was unusually fast given the piece count (my rule of thumb is 15 minutes/100 pieces, so I expected a 5 hour build). Most of that speed was due to the nature of the build, which often has you putting together 2 or 4 copies of the same unit as you build up the visible sides of the rocket. You&#39;ll want to keep an eye out for that &quot;x2&quot; and &quot;x4&quot; icon and adopt an assembly-line to keep things from getting repetitive. There was also a great efficiency to the progression of the build, and the division of pieces into the 12 numbered bags. Of course, there was also a general excitement&nbsp;hurrying my hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>The Model</u></strong></p>

<p>One of my favorite things about Lego is how often you get a different experience depending on your viewing distance. The best models look solid and professional from afar, detailed as you approach, and playful&nbsp;when you are close. The Lego Ideas line, in particular, has delivered well in this category with models like the Ecto 1, DeLorean Time Machine, Wall-E, and Beatles Yellow Submarine. The Saturn V is no different.</p>

<p>From afar, the Saturn V&#39;s considerable size is best appreciated, and the flushness of its design is salient. It looks like a spacecraft capable of sending you to the moon. As you approach, the beautifully printed USA and flag tiles inspire a deep patriotism and the incredible details along the side of the rocket are jaw-dropping. In your hands, the separability of the rocket stages, and the usefulness of the Lunar lander and extra Command Module are made manifest.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>The Joy of Lego</u></strong></p>

<p>I really love Lego, as I am sure you do as well. I am never less than amazed at what can be done with a set of bricks, and I get such satisfaction out of constructing my favorite things from films and life&nbsp;and then displaying them with pride. I have been obsessed with space&nbsp;as long as I can remember. I saved money from many birthdays and Christmases at a young age to buy my own telescope, and even went to Space Camp (highly recommended). As long as I have been collecting Lego, I have dreamed that they would make a Saturn V better than what they had tried in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/920-2/Rocket-Launch-Pad"">1970s</a>. It took some fan designers and 10,000 votes, but finally we have it. And I could not be happier with the result. It is truly the best Lego set I have ever seen.&nbsp;</p>

"Sobel","2017-06-11T14:06:24.52Z","An incredible set! I am speechless and could shout for joy at the same time!","<p>When I told my wife, I bought me the LEGO Saturn V, she was a little shocked by what a set this size would cost! When I told her it was &quot;only&quot; 119&euro;, she was still a little mad at me for spending so much money on LEGO, but she went OK with it. I also have to say, the price is nice, especially when you look at other sets, from Star Wars or City, for example, where you pay the same price or more and have less parts!<br />
And WHAT you get for your money!!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>This LEGO Ideas set comes in a large box, which shows a lot of details from the set, with small footage pictures from Saturn V launches added. It shows the separated model with the additional parts (landing craft, splashdowned command module) without taking the aniticipation I had for the set.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>When you buy a set with almost 2000 parts, you are to expect some interesting ones with it. Same here. Several parts where all-new to me, and I liked how the designers used the curved parts to shape the rocket. The flags and writings on the rocket are PRINTED! NO STICKERS, which I found absolutely fantastic!! Made me feel like back then, when I started collecting LEGO... An look at those tiny tiny microfigures! So small, yet so detailed! Gotta love &#39;em!!</p>

<h3><br />
Minifigures</h3>

<p>Or as to say &quot;microfigures&quot;! Just look at them! So tiny, yet so detailed! There are three of them (of course) plus one as spare part, just in case you lose one.<br />
Unfortunately there is no designated place to put the third one, but if you&#39;re ambitious, you can fit in the command module loosely.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>There is a reason why it says 14+ on the box! This is clearly no set for your average 6-10yo little LEGO-fan!<br />
I had to split the build on two days, so I am not sure how long it took me overall. I guess some 4.5-5 hours with distractions by my big girl (&quot;Daddy can you put in a new CD?&quot;, &quot;Daddy what does that part do?&quot;, &quot;Daddy, how big is the rocket going to be?&quot; etc.).<br />
The interior of every module is built first (of course...) and in a very sturdy, sometimes quite puzzling way. I was wondering now and then, what a certain step was good for, which came clear to me much later, when the outer hull was put together. Many different colors are used for the interior, which is very helpful. If all was done in grey or something, it would be very confusing, but that way, you can properly see which part goes where. I just loved to see how everything added up so smoothly...<br />
Some steps can be quite repetitive, but if you do all the parts which are required &quot;x2&quot; or &quot;x4&quot; at once, you&#39;ll be much faster. Seeing this baby grow in front of you is worth every piece of work!!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It&#39;s gigantic!!! No doubt the biggest model I ever owned or have ever seen! And with all it&#39;s size it is still full of details! I compared it to actual pictures of a Saturn V rocket and WOW, it&#39;s absolutely stunning! Even my wife had to admit, that the designers did a great job in giving it an almost perfect round shape and adding so many details (for example the ventilation ring, the fuel pipes [?] on the outside and the b/w color pattern)!<br />
Despite the size, it is not as heavy as I expected, you can lift it easily with one hand and don&#39;t have to fear it breaking apart or something. The single modules are linked very well, so it&#39;s harder to separate them, than putting them together!<br />
The landing module fits nicely in the space underneath the service module and can be attached to the rotated SM for a realistic lunar landing.<br />
Like mentioned before, the third astronaut microfigure has no real place to be put in, but I put it inside the hollow parts of the command module cone. Serves well, I guess, because Michael Collins had to stay exactly there, while Neal and Buzz went moonwalking! ;-)<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Great!! Incredible!! Fantastic!! Enormous!! These are just some words that come to my mind when describing this LEGO Ideas-set. Must be one of the best, if not THE best, LEGO sets ever! Everything fits: The beautiful box, the detailed and interesting instructions booklet, the challenging build, the massive and sturdy finished model, the abundance of details and the realistic playability! I could easily explain the whole Apollo 11 mission to my 5yo girl with the help of this great model! And all that joy and glory for a quite reasonable price! So I have to say: Go get yours NOW!!!</p>

<p>I have only one real big problem now:</p>

<p>Where do I put this big baby in our 60m&sup2; (72yd&sup2;) apartement??? ;-D</p>

"ludovisser","2017-06-18T18:54:02.42Z","This is a must-have set for any space enthusiast","<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>Recently, I&#39;ve concentrated mostly on Technic builds, and together with the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/5571-1/Giant-Truck"">5571 Giant Truck/Black Cat</a>&nbsp;this is the only System-like set that I still own. In the Technic theme, the past decade or so has brought the &quot;studless&quot; system with many new parts and techniques that create a lot of new possibilities. Due to my focus on Technic, I completely missed that the regular bricks had gone through a similar revolution with a huge selection of brackets and other SNOT-enabling bricks. As such, this build was a giant revelation for me: like a crash-course in advanced SNOT building. However, as you may have read in <a href=""https://brickset.com/article/27956/review-21309-nasa-apollo-saturn-v"">other</a> <a href=""http://www.brothers-brick.com/2017/05/10/go-launch-lego-ideas-21309-nasa-apollo-saturn-v-review/"">reviews</a>, the techniques used in this build will appeal also to the most advanced builders.</p>

<p>It is a wonderful build and despite some repetitive parts, never boring due to the amazing variety of&nbsp;techniques used. I could hardly contain my enthusiasm while building and sometimes&nbsp;made a few small mistakes in my hurry to finish the build. Some parts of the build are difficult and you need to check the instructions carefully to makes sure that you have aligned the parts properly. Also, the inside of the rocket is made of large cylindrical parts with brackets on the side and then&nbsp;large sections of the side panels are added lengthwise, which can be tricky sometimes because you need to carefully line up studs that are far&nbsp;apart. None of these challenges are prohibitively difficult though, and who doesn&#39;t like a bit of a challenge in their builds?</p>

<p>Solid&nbsp;5 points for building experience.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>The model consist of 1969 parts: a large portion of this is the amount of 2x3 curved slope bricks that make up most of the sides (144 to be exact). There is a huge selection of brackets of various kinds (144 in total), and there&nbsp;is a large variety of mostly small parts that make up the inside of the rocket. All of the inside (invisible) parts are color-coded to make the instructions more easy to interpret (very helpful, I might add), but the result is that you end up with a lot of parts in a lot of colors.</p>

<p>Then there is a nice selection of interesting parts, such as the large cylinder sections, the nacelles of the engines, etc. I would imagine that it is an excellent parts pack for space builders. For other themes, probably not so much.</p>

<p>And then there is the creative part usage. The scale of the model is roughly 1:110, which means that it&#39;s difficult to put small details. However, the makers did succeed wonderfully anyway by using parts in a very creative way. Examples are flowers as command module thrusters, train&nbsp;pantographs in the main engines and many small odd parts used in the SNOT arrangements.</p>

<p>I&#39;m doubting between 4 and 5 stars for parts, but I&#39;m going for 5 because of the inventive use of parts.</p>

<h2>Playability</h2>

<p>The model is exceptionally&nbsp;suitable for reenacting the Apollo missions. Of course&nbsp;the stages separate, but the escape tower also comes off, together with the white cone resembling the booster protection fairing, allowing you to put the command module onto the service module. You can then remove the payload fairings, revealing the moon lander, do the 180 degree turn of the command module to dock with the lander. The ascent stage of the lander also can be disconnected from the descent stage, so you can also reenact the way back, all the way to splashdown.</p>

<p>The stages are a bit difficult to disconnect, because the connection between them is quite strong.&nbsp;I once had the 3rd stage fall off when I disconnected the first and second stage with a too big of a jolt (probably didn&#39;t connect it completely). The set is thus not so suitable for small kids to play with, but that&#39;s also not the target demographic.&nbsp;I&#39;m 32 and enjoying playing with the set tremendously.</p>

<p>5 stars.</p>

<h2>Value for Money</h2>

<p>This is a good deal. At about 6 cents per part the set is cheap, and you get a huge amount of parts for it. And of course, it is a lot of fun too, which should be worth something too!</p>

<p>5 stars.</p>

<h3>Overall Rating</h3>

<p>I hardly ever find myself reviewing anything and giving&nbsp;it top scores for everything, but I had no other choice. This set is flawless, as far as I&#39;m concerned! Of course, as a giant space geek I might be a bit biased towards the theme, but I think that also objectively there&#39;s very little, if anything, to complain about in this set. The many praises this set has received is testament to that.</p>

<p>Aside from the building and playing fun, the set makes an excellent display piece. With the included stands and the moonlanding and splashdown mini-dioramas you have a great display.&nbsp;If you are a space geek such as myself, you must get this set!</p>

<p>But also if you are less of a space geek, I&#39;m also sure you will enjoy this build. And then you can reuse the parts and&nbsp;gained SNOT technique knowledge for your MOCs.</p>

<p>Get it.</p>

"Brick_Cuppy","2017-08-11T04:31:00.813Z","A lesson in advanced SNOT techniques","<p>NASA Apollo Saturn V was a very highly anticipated set, and many say it is the best set of 2017. I was initially a bit skeptical (since I&#39;m not a very big space fan), but I warmed to it after reading many reviews. Is this set as good as they say? If you want to find out, then grab your popcorn and your drink, this review is going to be long... as long as the 1 meter rocket about which you are reading!</p>

<h2>Box and instructions:</h2>

<p>The box has some nice artwork, I really like the different stages shown on the back. It&#39;s not a shoe-box type box like other IDEAS sets, just the usual open-flap. The instructions have a blueprint of the set with &quot;Saturn V building instructions&quot; written on the front, in a rather old and tattered fashion, which I like. Next is information on the real rocket and interviews with both the fan designers and the LEGO designers. The 171-page instructions were clear and normally added only 5 or less pieces each step. The paper is thick and didn&#39;t bend as they usually do. There were 12 numbered bags, overflowing with parts.</p>

<h2>Nanofigures:</h2>

<p>There are three of them, plus a spare. They look adorable, with all their little, accurate printing, and their cute, gold visors. They don&#39;t fit in the command module control area, but you can put them in the space between the two <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6134782/wall-1-2-circle-2x4x2-w-cutout"">light grey 2x4x2 1/2 circle wall panels.</a></p>

<h2>Parts:</h2>

<p>Just to add to the amazement of this set, there are 1969 pieces, the year the first man landed on the moon, in the Saturn V Apollo II rocket.</p>

<p>When opening the bags, and seeing all the pieces, I almost felt giddy with glee. It&#39;s not just the rare/re-coloured parts, but the sheer numbers of them. one bag consisted of almost entirely 2x3 curved slopes! here&#39;s all the re-coloured and rare(under 10 sets) pieces;</p>

<p>There are also 28 printed elements(excluding the Nanofigures), 16 white 2x3 curved slopes, printed with either a U, S, A, or the American flag, 8 white 1x6 tiles printed with &quot;united&quot; or &quot;states&quot;, 1 white 1x8 tile printed with black dashed lines, 1 transparent 1x2 tile printed with the American flag (placed between two studs on the moon surface, a technique that designers have only recently started re-using), 1 dark grey 4x4x2 cone brick printed with technical stuff, and finally, a 1 2x2 round slider printed with a hatch.</p>

<p>It would take forever to tell you about every cool piece, but here&#39;s a few I found very interesting:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>2x3 curved slopes:</strong> a total of 212! ok, it&#39;s not the most useful piece, just a wider version of&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4249112/brick-w-bow-1-3"">this</a> , but seeing the sheer numbers fall out of the bags was jaw-dropping!</li>
	<li><strong>light grey flowers: </strong>4 of them. It&#39;s very hard to find a use for flowers besides... well... flowers, but this opens up a new window for their uses.</li>
	<li><strong>1x1 rounded plate with bar: </strong>They&#39;re not actually that rare any more, but getting 20 in one set is awesome! I&#39;m sure this piece was on the parts-I-wish-were-made list of many a FOL(it was on mine).</li>
	<li><strong>pearl gold &quot;apollo stud&quot;: </strong>21 of this appropriately-named piece, the most in any set. A very useful element, and being in gold is just icing on the cake.</li>
	<li><strong>Trans-orange 3x3 dish: </strong>I love anything transparent, so the five in this set are a highlight for me. the 1x1 trans-orange tiles and plates are great too.</li>
	<li><strong>2x2 round tile with recessed stud: </strong>you get 4 in light grey and 5 in white. this is one of the best circular elements ever made. No longer do we have to put a Stud between the 4 studs of a 2x2 round plate, with those annoying studs showing. Another great addition to the jumper family!</li>
	<li><strong>1x2 grill tile:</strong> One of my favorite pieces ever, and you get 112 of them in white!</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Build:</h2>

<p>As stated in the title, this set is full of advanced techniques for turning studs on their sides. Even expert builders might learn a few tricks from this set. The structure for the rocket is made up of cylinders, SNOT elements, and many other different coloured elements that make it easy to see which parts should go where. The outside is made of panels that fit onto the SNOT elements, and different techniques are used for each section. I won&#39;t spoil the build, but the techniques are brilliant!</p>

<p><strong>stage 1: </strong>Is the largest section, taking up half of the 12 bags. It starts with the inner structure, and there is a strange-looking thing in the middle, the purpose of which will become clear later. Next to be added are the outer panels, then the textured ring made of 1x2 grill tiles, attached ingeniously to the strange thingie in the middle, and finally the engines, using pearl dark grey half-barrels(appearing for the first time in this colour)&nbsp; and pantographs(also appearing for the first time in pearl dark grey) as oxidizer pumps.</p>

<p><strong>stage 2: </strong>Is the middle section of the rocket, and it&#39;s structure is similar to stage 1, although the thinga-majigger is completely different here. Once again, panels are attached to the SNOT elements, and the textured ring is attached to the thinga-majigger. Even though both the second and first stages are built similarly, they were different enough for both to be interesting builds. It also has five little engines that slot nicely into place in stage 1.</p>

<p><strong>stage 3: </strong>Is the smallest section, and therefore is built with completely different techniques. Instead of 2x3 curves, it uses 2x2 curves, and the inner structure is a very peculiar and colourful contraption. The rocket narrows towards the top, and large half-cones are used in one area. Finally, it finishes with a lattice made of tap elements, and a single white pillar and cone. This section has only a single engine, the same size as stage 2 engines.</p>

<p><strong>modules:</strong> There are an extra four small models in this set:</p>

<p><em>- The lunar module:</em> Is extremely detailed, and I particularly like the use of shiny and pearl gold pieces to create the kapton foil surrounding the module. It can be stored inside the small space between the two half-cones, underneath the command module.</p>

<p><em>-The moon surface: </em>Made of just one octagonal plate and two 2x2 round tiles with recessed stud that represent the cratered surface of the moon. It&#39;s used for displaying the lunar module and the nanofigures, and I appreciate it&#39;s inclusion, as it is an important part of the mission. I just wish they had included a 1x1 round tile with a printed footprint for that famous step; &quot;That&#39;s one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind&quot;.</p>

<p><em>-The splashdown: </em>You can detach the printed 4x4 cone from the command module attach it to a dark blue 8x8 plate with 4 studs(new in this colour), and then add the flame-yellowish orange flotation balloons and the orange flotation collar that keep the capsule from inverting. I really like this little model</p>

<p><em>-The display stand:</em> Is split into three parts, one of which is taller than the others to support the third stage. They use 6 blue 1x6x5 girders, in reference to the blue supports at the Kennedy Space Centre. These are perfectly capable of supporting the Saturn V, even when the rocket is separated.</p>

<p>Overall, the most fun I&#39;ve had building a set ever!</p>

<h2>Overall Opinion:</h2>

<p>Amazing. Brilliant. Unbelievable. Which word describes this set the best? I think Incredible just about sums it up! Every aspect of the real rocket has been represented here perfectly, from the black designs, to the engines, to the tiny details on the command module. Yet, even with all those tiny details, it&#39;s completely stable! I can hold it in one hand! This is because of the brilliant inner structure of SNOT pieces and cylinders. Separating the three stages is quite easy too, although I found that when separating the first and second stages while holding the rocket horizontally, can sometimes cause the third section to fall out as well. But there are no such problems when holding it upright, and the connection is strong enough that you can swing, swoosh, and generally be careless with the Saturn V, and it won&#39;t break at all.</p>

<p>I knew that this set was going to be big, but I never knew it would be this BIG. It&#39;s absolutely GIGANTIC. I thought that standing it upright would be very precarious because of it&#39;s hight, but the engines distribute the weight evenly, and there is no fear of it falling when on a flat surface. However, it is more stable when displayed on the blue supports, and it looks fabulous on top of a mantle or table. You can display it either separated or together, but I prefer it together.</p>

<p>NASA Apollo Saturn V is an incredible set. I applaud the fan designers Felix Stiessen and Valerie Roche for their fantastic project, and the Lego designers Carl Merriam, Michael Psiaki, and Austin Carlson for turning it into the best set of 2017! Maybe even ever! It has everything a perfect Lego set needs:</p>

<p>- playability and displayability</p>

<p>- a fun build</p>

<p>- nice parts</p>

<p>Assembling it benefits from having a partner (spouse, sibling, parent) because there are some sections that require 2 or 4 copies and you can expedite the process by working in parallel.&nbsp; You could also just build it on your own and experience some of the best Lego engineering I&#39;ve seen.&nbsp; There&#39;s a sub-structure that ties the center pieces together and there are some points where you wonder how it&#39;s going to form the actual rocket shape, but once it starts assembling it hits you with an &#39;aha&#39; moment and you will marvel at the ingenuity of the Lego designers.</p>

<p>As expected of a set of this magnitude, the rocket includes all 3 stages which can be separated and includes the lander and command module which all fit inside of the rocket so you can recreate the lunar mission in microscale.&nbsp; I say microscale because the figures that come with it are much smaller than your standard minifigs.&nbsp; The only change that I made was to replace the generic white piece at the top of the rocket with the command module that comes with the set and to store the lunar lander inside the compartment at the top of the rocket where it would sit normally.</p>

<p>The only downside I can think of is that the stages are a bit hard to separate and hold together.&nbsp; The first to second stage uses 8 clip and rod connectors and the second to third stage uses 4 clip and rod connectors.&nbsp; I experienced one of the second stage rockets coming loose during the separation but I imagine the real thing is a bit more robust than some plastic lego rods.</p>

"pinz","2018-03-18T23:48:18.22Z","great Ideas-Set","<p>This is one set, I think Lego showed together with the Fan-Team, who had initially the idea, that they really can pill it off.</p>

<p>It starts with the number of pieces, 1969. That&#39;s also the year Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon. It continues with the instructions manual and the model it self.</p>

<p>To put together this 1969 pieces you have 12 building sections, all neatly packed and numbered. Only in one section I thought, how the hell do they put together the bricks? From 3 times 4&nbsp;printed bricks where 10 in the main-package and 2 in the smaller one included. So if a whole set of 4 would have been somewhere else, fine! But 2? That leaves me a bit puzzled all the time, in any case, no parts where missing, and the building is a charm.</p>

<p>These 12 sections prevents the fact, that you have too many parts to look thru at the start, so you sort, get an overview ot the parts faster. And it is easier to make a break at a defined point.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model itself has a lot of details, many prints - not a single sticker! - that is quite an achievement&nbsp;for Lego, who seems to love the sticker more and more, even in far more expensive models. Also it is quite a stable and rigid construction, a lot of nice technics to build in unusual angles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model it self is meant to relife the whole story, from ignition, thru the burn of the first, than the second and at last the third stage. Also the extracting of the lunar landing module and the return to earth.</p>

<p>Both, the Fans and Lego did a great job with this model, You get it still in the shops, don&#39;t wait if you think of buying this particular set. I guess it will rise fast in price, hence Lego stopped the production. And you have quite a number of pieces with prints in it, that will make it hard to get them on bricklink or brickowl&nbsp;to a good price.&nbsp;</p>

"omnius","2019-03-23T22:24:22.61Z","An instant classic","<p>Released under the Ideas range, this is the latest in a long line of NASA-themed sets and a must-have for anyone into STEM or the history of space travel.</p>

<p>Ordered into numbered bags, the set includes the realistically-detailed stages of a Saturn V rocket, used to send men to the moon in the Apollo missions. It&#39;s built separately as the first, second and third stages, along with the Lunar Excursion Module, Command Module, Service Module and Launch Escape System. Additionally, you can recreate the LEM on the moon&#39;s surface (complete with a US flag printed on a clear 1 x 2 tile!), or the successful splashdown that marked each crew&#39;s safe return to Earth. It also includes three stands that allow you to lay the rocket on its side (the safest way to display it!). You can also take the LEM, Service Module and &#39;splashdown&#39; Command Module to represent the flight from Earth&#39;s orbit to the moon. It&#39;s all finished off by three &#39;microfigures&#39; with intricate printing to represent the three-man crew of each mission.</p>

<p>Now you might think that building what is essentially a long, tapering cylinder might not be the most interesting build - well you couldn&#39;t be more wrong! The rocket&#39;s outer surface is, for the most part, made of tiles and curved slopes. Internally, a complex structure is built, which the tiles and slopes attach to. It should be noted that all the flags and lettering are printed on their respective tiles and slopes. The build is surprisingly intricate, but does involve patience as the tiles need to fit precisely in place.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the finished model is an impressive piece, measuring one metre tall, around 1:110 scale. The three-stage rocket clips together, so they can be separated while remaining fairly sturdy - I would recommend carrying the rocket two-handed, though! It can stand upright, but as I mentioned earlier, I&#39;d recommend using the stands to display it horizontally.</p>

<p>As a final note, the piece count on the box is 1,969 - anyone would think they deliberately aimed for that number!</p>

<p>All in all, this is great set for a decent price, and represents an important historical achievement. I would highly recommend it.</p>

"rab1234","2018-08-30T21:09:49.157Z","Impressive looking model","<h2><strong>Overall Rating</strong></h2>

<p>The apollo Saturn V is a fun build with a lot of pieces and looks terrific on display.&nbsp; Despite a lack of playability, this one earns a 5/5 overall.</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>This is a great example of a fun build.&nbsp; There were many times when I was not sure where a sub build was going before getting to a satisfying integration into the larger build.&nbsp; Some very creative techniques for achieving the round shape.&nbsp; I was also pleasantly surprised by the number of times that I figured I would be duplicating a section 4 times, but instead had 2 or 3 subtly different builds.&nbsp; 5/5 for build.</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>A lot of parts for the price and a surprising number of large parts as well.&nbsp; With a price per piece of 5.6 you would expect to see a lot of small tiles and plates, but there is definite size and weight to the finished model.&nbsp; A lot of black and white, but that can be forgiven for the sheer number of pieces as well as some nice printing.</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>Lego did a pretty good job of adding a bit of playability to what is essentially an excellent display model.&nbsp; The 4 tiny figures and landing crafts definitely add to both play and display.&nbsp; Although the rocket itself is really too heavy (and I&#39;d be afraid of the sections getting disconnected and crashing to the floor) to be swooshable.</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>As already mentioned, the number of pieces is high, the build is fun, it&#39;s a great display piece, and the cost is low.&nbsp; Outstanding value (especially if you luck out like me and find one in the box for $45)!</p>

"DutchFlyer","2019-06-25T22:03:08.737Z","Much bigger than the sum of its parts","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The Saturn V had been on my &#39;wanted&#39; list for quite some time, but other sets kept getting slotted in higher. The release of the <strong>Lunar Lander (set 10266)</strong> seemed a good enough excuse&nbsp;to get this set. In hindsight, I am left wondering why I did not get this set before. It is a surprisingly quick build, using many interesting techniques to create a stable core and allow for the various stages of the real rocket to be represented faithfully as individual sections. The result is massive, and looks (and feels) much bigger than the 1969 bricks (+ spare pieces) set actually contains. A bonus is that there are no stickers. This set also shows the great skill of the designer and the quality of the original ideas set. At first glance, RRP seems high. When built, the price is much more reasonable. Thus, if you really like the space theme or more general, a really high quality Lego set, I would seriously consider saving for this set.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The very shape&nbsp;of the Saturn V suggests that this could be a tedious repetitive build, but&nbsp;that is not the case at all. The construction of the inner core, the rather quick assembly of some of the shells that form the skin, the separation into separate stages, all of this prevents the build from becoming tedious.</p>

<p>The build was also surprisingly quick. The way the core is constructed is interesting, and a shows a good understanding of Lego geometry. The inner core consists of many colourful parts, but in the end everything is covered up nicely.&nbsp;(Almost) everything fits snugly, and results in a nice round shape for the rocket. Even the transition between the various stages with different diameters looks good. It is important to take care and pay attention during construction, because fixing mistakes later on is a pain...</p>

<p>The construction of the moon lander and the crew compartment is simple, but effective.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The Saturn V is massive. The original was, and so is this set. It stands a meter tall, and feels remarkably solid and heavy. In many ways it looks and feels much much bigger than a 1969 piece set. The sides are quite smooth, but there is enough variation in texture to not make the rocket look boring. The first stage booster construction is the most interesting, IMHO. The rocket can be separated in various stages, just like the original. Only the very top (the escape tower)&nbsp;cannot be separated due to its construction (for which there does not seem to be an alternative). People whom I showed the rocket for the first time were surprised that this was actually possible with Lego.</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>This set definitely is NOT a play set - it is simply way too big for that. You can pose it standing up, or laying down on three supports. The two mini-displays of the moon-lander and the floating crew compartment are nice. However, the whole model can be used in&nbsp;a demonstration of the mission sequence, including the landing and return to orbit. The lunar lander does fit inside the rocket. Jangbricks&nbsp;(IIRC) has a nice demonstration of this). It could actually be used as a teaching tool in class.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this is one of the better Lego sets of the past few years, and I can see why some would argue this set among the best Lego sets ever. Personally, I would not go that far, but IMHO this definitely is one of the top pure display sets Lego has released. I also have a difficult time imagining Lego ever being able to top this model in a re-design/re-release. The price tag (120 euros) is hefty, but IMHO worth it. I therefore hope that Lego will keep this set in the line-up for a very long time. If you like space exploration of simply a good Lego set, IMHO you should definitely consider getting this set.</p>
