<p><strong>Awesomeness:</strong>&nbsp; I am a little biased because I am so stoked for The Lego Batman movie and I get super giddy every time something new comes out for it, which seems like constantly.&nbsp; It is such a strange build.&nbsp; I am drawn to it.&nbsp; If you are not familar with the phantom zone, it is basically like this other dimension thing from the superman comics and movies where really bad guys are sent to rot for all eternity.&nbsp; Since the movie has not been released as I write this, I am sooooo curious to see if it will play a part in the movie and what exactly the build is.&nbsp; It has to be for something right?&nbsp; It comes with good pieces and has a clear stand for it.&nbsp; It looks great as a little display piece next to my other Batman sets.</p>

<p><strong>The minifig: </strong>It is Batman.&nbsp; Good thing- it is one of the cheapest ways to get Batman.&nbsp; Bad news- Batman comes in soooo many of the new sets we already have like 5 of him.&nbsp; It would have been cool to maybe get a different version of him or bruce wayne or something.&nbsp; But I am not too bothered by having another Batman.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, it is nothing to write home about.&nbsp; If you are a fan of polybags or Batman you&#39;ll be happy.</p>

"Kalhiki","2017-01-20T21:12:09.493Z","Attack of the Phantom Menace!","<p>Haven&#39;t written a review in some time, but got this little... Thing, and thought &quot;what the heck, I&#39;ll go for it.&quot; So here&#39;s a review.</p>

<p>Since the movie isn&#39;t out yet, I have no idea what this set represents. Is it a set-only event? Will Batman find himself in the Phantom Zone? Time will tell.</p>

<p><strong>Minifig</strong></p>

<p>You get Batman. Surprise. If you&#39;re familiar with DC sets or have a TLBM Batman, then you know what you&#39;re getting into. If not, well... He&#39;s Batman. He has a utility belt and batarang (both have spares) and the newer, bendier, clothier cape.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The build is pretty neat, actually. There&#39;re some cool little bits of&nbsp;greebling, and a nice use of a black lightsaber&nbsp;blade piece going through the body to keep the thing together. Not too bad for a polybag, if I do say so myself!</p>

<p><strong>The&nbsp;Finished Product</strong></p>

<p>... Okay, I&#39;m just going to&nbsp;say it, this thing is pretty terrifying.&nbsp;It&#39;s one of those creepy/cute sorta deals. It&#39;s ovular in shape and has three big eyes... But those eyes are red. And&nbsp;the body is covered in spikes. And I&#39;ve started calling it&nbsp;The Phantom Menace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&#39;s honestly not much to say about it. I guess you can fly it around and attack Batman? One thing&#39;s for sure, it looks great. I love how sinister it is. And considering its size, they managed to get a wonderful looking model.</p>

<p>Oh, and one thing worth mentioning: it does&nbsp;include a clear stand, which is not present on the stock image. Nice for display. Just have this creepy thing hovering there... Staring... Into your soul.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I dig it. There may not be much you can do with it, but it certainly looks great as a display piece. Honestly, I&#39;d love to get more of them. Have a small army of these little creeps. But then what would I do with all the extra Batmen?</p>

<p>So if you happen to find one (I found it in the Valentines Day section of Target), I&#39;d say go for it. It&#39;s a cool looking thingamajig that&#39;ll look great in your Batman display.</p>

<p>Or wherever you want to put it...</p>

More aptly I feel this would be better referred to as Batman in the Fortress of Solitude, because the model in this set features one of Superman&rsquo;s security drones as seen in that scene of the film.</span></span></span></span></p>

"redbeardlegoman","2017-12-31T00:14:27.577Z","Somewhat Milking It","<p>Overall this is a fairly underwhelming polybag.&nbsp; If you are a completist, then you&#39;re going to get it regardless of anyone&#39;s review.&nbsp; Beyond that, you might not rush out for this.&nbsp; In fact, passing on this puts another $6 in your wallet for something else.<br />
<br />
Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Great for those who want a Batman, but can&#39;t afford/acquire one of the 4 bajillion sets that Batman is in.</li>
	<li>Some new dark red pieces, and some trans blue dishes and bars (good for sci-fi MOCs).</li>
	<li>At least this Phantom Zone ... thing ... floats on a transparent dish and pole.</li>
	<li>I can&#39;t remember, but there might be an extra batarang and utility belt.</li>
	<li>If you absolutely have to have your Brickset&nbsp;inventory for The LEGO Batman Movie at 100%, then this will get you there, though no more so than getting all of the other sets, so I&#39;m really just stretching for a back-handed pro here.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Another Batman.&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; Could there have been some other figure included?&nbsp; Some other Z-list Rogues Gallery villian would have been preferable.&nbsp; Or a Batman ally.&nbsp; Do you know what I would give for an Alfred Pennyworth or Bruce Wayne that doesn&#39;t come in huge set?&nbsp; Well, about the six bucks my wife spent on this for me.</li>
	<li>I guess that while I can put whatever this is in with my soon-to-own General Zod, with them both being part of the Phantom Zone, I... WAIT!&nbsp; Zod!&nbsp; You could have put Zod in the bag!&nbsp; Or Ursa!&nbsp; Non!</li>

"Red_Five2","2017-02-13T08:30:39.59Z","The Phantom zone???","<p>I had no idea what the phantom zone was until the movie. This is my first Lego Batman movie set. On February 11th you could pick it up with the times (in the UK).</p>

<p><strong>The Minifig:</strong>&nbsp;This is my first Batman. It comes with the new utility belt which is a separate mold. It comes with two expressions. One is smirking and the other is angry. The torso is pretty much the same to the 2012 version of Batman. His accessory is a baterang.</p>

<p><strong>The build:&nbsp;</strong>I don&#39;t know what the build is but I know it is part of the Phantom zone. It comes on a transparent base. It has three transparent red tile studs. Also four blue rods, four arrows and four claw hands.</p>

"vikings","2020-05-28T04:46:46.437Z","The Phantom Zone","<p><strong>Box/Instruction:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a polybag with normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some really cool pieces in this set. You get&nbsp;four trans blue sticks, four silver spikes, a clear pole, clear medium dish, and two trans blue dishes. The maroon parts are also really nice to get. The total piece count for the set is 59. Overall a really good piece haul.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Batman:</strong></p>

<p>You get Batman in this polybag. He has a double-sided head. On one side he has white eyes and a smile and on the other side he is angry and his eyes are close. He has his classic Batman mask and black soft cape. He has printing on the front and back of his torso of the suit, abs, and bat logo. He has a yellow belt which is really cool and adds a lot to the figure. He has plain black legs. He is armed with a black batarang. Overall a good figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a really good polybag. The drone look really cool with all the different pieces sticking out in a bunch of different directions. The clear pole and medium dish are used as a stand that provides great stability. Batman is great with the printing on his torso is great. The yellow utility belt adds some color and detail to him. I recommend this set if you are a Lego Batman fan or to your Lego Collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
