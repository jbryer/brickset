"OJAG","2017-02-09T19:33:28.693Z","A Great Batman Set","<p>This is a good set overall. The packaging is enticing&nbsp;&nbsp;and looks great. The build is &nbsp;good with a few &quot;a-ha!&quot; moments. There are an OK amount of stickers so younger kids can build this with help. The minifigs are great, especially Scarecrow. The pizza van is a nice vehicle with lots of playability. The house is a nice background scene and adds to the atmosphere. Out of 100 I would score this 88, the downside being the extra head for the guard.&nbsp;</p>

"Sethro3","2017-02-21T21:19:23.287Z","Special Delivery!","<p>After seeing the LEGO Batman Movie, I went back over all of the sets that were released. This was a blink and miss it moment, but it was an important scene in the movie. How does the LEGO set stack up?</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>- Great pizza delivery bike cart. Very clever idea and I always welcome new competitors to City Pizza brand. Although, this is a sticker (as most usually are), it will be neat to use it on a custom Modular building.</p>

<p>- The build, while small, is actually executed quite well. The guarded entry works pretty well at this scale. Naturally something bigger could be better, but at the low piece count and price, what would you really expect?</p>

<p>- I definitely could use more security guards, so I am okay with this inclusion here. He is dressed similar to the Mr. Freeze set, which makes sense since they are located at the same place. (I also like the extra head. It adds some play value for the reaction, or you can use it on another figure!)</p>

<p>- Pizzas! I don&#39;t have too many, so these will be welcome.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- Scarecrow can be either a pro or a con. He is unique to this set, but he doesn&#39;t add a lot in terms of collecting minifigures. His summer release will be much more welcome. But with that said, his face is menacing and the toxic pizza is interesting.</p>

<p>- Scale is small, but as stated before, what would you expect at this price?</p>

<p>- Another Batman. I know it is his movie and I know there is some variety in terms of facial expression, but when you have a few of him already, it&#39;s hard to get excited for yet another copy. He is the new Spiderman or Jack Sparrow.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>I found this set on a 20% off sale, so that sealed the deal for me. The value isn&#39;t poor at full MSRP, but it made the purchase a lot easier on sale. While the set itself isn&#39;t spectacular, it isn&#39;t horrible. Especially if you are wanting some new figures or to play out a scene from the movie. But even with the positives, I would likely not purchase it if I didn&#39;t find it on sale. And I would instead wait until this summer for the other Scarecrow set. But I can&#39;t wait to build a Luigi&#39;s Pizza of my own.</p>

"KingAlanI","2017-04-25T03:49:59.647Z","Nice different LEGO pizza","<p>I bought this due to the pizza topic (along with #41311 Heartlake Pizzeria and #60150 Pizza Van). Not being used to superhero themes, the look was a nice change of pace for LEGO pizzerias. Still, I replaced the villain head with a regular one and set aside the scary pizza. I liked the look of the security guard compared to LEGO City cops. I like how the moped can sort of balance by itself and is very stable with the trailer hooked up. I wish it was easier to fit the guard behind his station while still holding his coffee cup. The guard station itself was nice and something I don&#39;t see much of.</p>

<p>I wish it wasn&#39;t an exclusive to LEGO.com or WalMart so it would be easier to get on sale, but it was an okay deal with good online promo items, and at least it has 3 minifigures whereas many sets of comparable size have only 2, including Heartlake Pizzeria.</p>

<p>A nice little play set and little&nbsp;fun build. For its size it offers quite a bit of play, with a varied cast of minifigures. There are 9 stickers in total, all of them easy to apply. The minifigures are OK; Batman is common, Scarecrow is nice (but due to his disguise not exceptional), and so is the security guard. Overall, even of it&#39;s price is on the higher end of the Batman Movie range,&nbsp;I would say that this set offers OK value for money.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build was fun, simple and - normally - quick. The stickers are easy to apply; only the panel for the security cabin posed some problems, due to the rougher texture of the surface it had to be applied to. Thankfully the pizza pieces are all prints. The mechanism to explode the sidewalls of the pizza cart is simple but effective. Age range is given as 7-14, and the vast majority of 7 year olds should be able to build this set.As all the stickers are applied on flat surfaces, this would also be a nice set to get learn how to apply stickers properly.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are three minifigures in this set. Batman is common, and nothing special. He is found in 7 sets in total, for instance the Bat-Dune buggy (set 70918), Mr. Freeze Ice Attack (set 70901) and Clayface Splat Attack (set 70904).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The security guard is a nice figure, even if there is only print on the front and back of the torso, and not on the legs. There is a nice gold printed badge on his head. I like the scared expression of his face print. One would have to swap heads if he is to be used in other settings.</p>

<p>Scarecrow is &#39;incognito&#39;, which means he has a torso print representing a pizza delivery shirt pulled over his regular clothing. and him wearing a helmet. The print on his torso (front and back is nice), especially how some of his normal clothing peeks through in the neck and on the lower arms. His legs also have a nice print of his normal &#39;scarecrow&#39; clothing. IMHO it is a nice minifigure, it just somehow does not appeal to me&nbsp;much (in comparison to other minifigs in the Lego Batman Movie range).</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Overall I think that the designer has done a nice job in creating this play set. The delivery vehicle and the security cabin are well designed and look and feel &#39;complete&#39;. The exploding sidewalls of the cart are easily reattached. Although the cabin is shallow, one can place the security guard in it. I like the sticker signs, and they make sense. Small, effective, well done.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This set is clearly a play set. There is a lot of interaction possible between the various elements of this set. Likewise, the pizza cart and the cabin can easily be integrated in a bigger Lego environment / Lego City. For a display set it simply lacks size (unless of course intended as part of a display of Lego Batman Movie vehicles).</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this is a nice set, even for its RRP. Part of its relatively high price might be explained by the motorcycle pieces, four printed pieces,&nbsp;and the three minifigures included. It works well as a play set and IMHO can be a nice gift. If one can find this set on a discount, it becomes well worth its price.&nbsp;</p>
