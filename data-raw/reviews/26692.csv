<p>The box is a bigger and thicker version of the regular $15 box size. In the top right corner we get a nice picture of Batman from the movie. There is some great artwork of the set on the front. On the back of the box it shows the features of the set and advertises the &quot; Build something Batman&quot; campaign. The top shows an actual size picture of the Batman minifigure.</p>

<p>The minifigures here are very good. Batman is mostly black but his bat symbol has a yellow outline to it. The new utility belt peice is the other yellow part of him, and I love this mold. I hope to see it on other future comic versions of Batman. There are also some grey lines on the front and back I his torso to represent muscle definition. The second and last minifigure is the long coat tail version of the Joker. This minifigure is great, with trench coat printing on the torso and legs, with a yellow shirt on the inside of the with a green tie. This is the cheapest way to get this figure unless you are able to get the Joker&#39;s battle training pollybag.</p>

<p>It is a very small build, not that complex. This probably took me about 15 to 20 minutes to build.</p>

<p>The first build is the Joker&#39;s balloon jetpack, which is very interesting. The jetpack part is kind of small, but the balloons make it look slightly bigger. The balloon jetpack uses some interesting peices. For the balloons, it uses red, blue, and yellow come peices and the balloon bottom peice from 2016 in the same three colors, and for the handles it uses the pain roller peice. The other part of the build, the nuclear plant part, I really like. It had a white canester that is part of the exploding feature when you push down on the yellow tile. Then there is some piping next to that that uses the new Technic macaroni peice. The next part is the Joker&#39;s bomb, which I really like the design of. It has four trans yellow green cylinders, two TNT prices, a clock printed peice and a few there peices, then next to that is a tan computer screen.</p>

<p>Over all I like this set, as the smallest set of the wave it&#39;s a good value because you get the long coat tail Joker, which is also in one of the bigger sets, The Scuttler. The balloon jet pack is very wacky, and I like it. My favorite part of the set is probably the nuclear bomb, it&#39;s very interesting and I like the peices they used. If you see this set in stores, and you don&#39;t wanna get the Scuttler for long coat tail Joker, I would recommend this because it also has some great builds and peices.</p>

"Hashem1983","2018-07-23T12:34:56.443Z","The Cheapest Way to Get Batman and his Rival ""The Joker","<p>I got this set over a year ago alongside the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70901-1/Mr-Freeze-Ice-Attack"">70901: Mr. Freeze Attack</a>&nbsp;that I would review later on as I was too lazy to review them both. However, this set is one of the cheapest sets from this theme to get Batman and The Joker.</p>

<p>It comes in a small box with the &quot;Batman Lego Movie&quot; label on it, yet it has a nice decent and great parts in a very small&nbsp;set, even the building experience for its size it was great, not so many small sets has such a delightful building experience starting with the Joker&#39;s Balloon&nbsp;bag back which is quite heavy I got to say. You then get to build a small scenery for an Gotham Energy facility that includes a white cylinder, an enormous bomb with an alarm clock clipped on a rail, however my favorite was the computer as it resemble a vintage computer from the 80s that I found it very nice, and there are red tubes that are connected to the white cylinder.</p>

<p>For the playability, the cylinder is placed on top of a 2X4 plate that once you press it down it pops out of its place as if it got exploded, it is a nice feature but it doesn&#39;t stay stable on its place once you want to put it back on as it is very loose.</p>

<p>There are only 2 minifigures&nbsp;in this set:</p>

<p>Batman: all in black, his torso is printed on both sides, and there&#39;s the new belt piece in yellow that you put on his waist, he also wears a cape with a very nice clothe material. The&nbsp;face is printed on both sides as well with different reactions.</p>

<p>The Joker: wears a purple suit, the torso is only printed from the front and the legs are printed as well for details. His face is in white with double expressions as well and he has a nice green hair piece that I would love to see it in different colors in other themes. There&#39;s also another thing that comes with him and that is the long purple tail, it has a nice look for the figure but the material that is used is paper like ans especially with the humongous device in his back I got afraid that&nbsp;it might tear it apart so I make him always standing.<br />
<br />
All in all, its a great mini set for play and display, especially if you want to have the greatest&nbsp;nemesis in your Lego collection&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Structures</strong></p>

<p>The bland tank is&nbsp;placed on green and gray base with yellow highlights.</p>

<p>The bomb is overcomplicated and lacks Joker touch (transparent green rods are cool looking though), it looks like a generic cartoon bomb with a giant clock face.</p>

<p><strong>Batman</strong></p>

<p>Batman has the unusual set of faces with no neutral expression.</p>

<p>Batman&#39;s cape&nbsp;is really soft and nice to the touch.</p>

<p>Grappling hook, when connected to the string, looks very crude - you need a piece in between to connect them and it&#39;s placed on the side &ndash; not very elegant.</p>

<p>I find the lack of the iconic&nbsp;&nbsp;batarangs&nbsp;very strange.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of yellow belt piece - it makes figures&nbsp;unproportionally tall, but&nbsp;it looks super good on builders / foremen (foreman&#39;s not included)!</p>

<p><strong>Joker</strong></p>

<p>Joker muzzle is adorable&nbsp;and fits perfectly under the cowl. I love this Joker Bat.</p>

<p>Joker can&#39;t stand on his&nbsp;own &ndash;&nbsp;the material for his jacket tails is very rigid and it takes time to remember the new form.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh, and he has balloons! They don&#39;t float, but don&#39;t have blood inside too.&nbsp;Which is good, I guess.</p>

<p>You can also find two paint rollers and two futuristic blasters in this escape contraption &ndash; neat!</p>
