"TinCanBassMan","2017-01-02T02:52:46.07Z","Enter the world of Lego Batman!","<h3>Box / Instructions</h3>

<p>The box features the Lego Batman Movie colours and layout. &nbsp;A single book takes you through the build starting with Catwoman and her motorcycle followed by Batgirl, Robin, and finally the storefront.</p>

<h3>Pieces</h3>

<p>Nothing unusual in this set. &nbsp;There are two pairs of 1x1 engine block pieces that form the V on either side of the bike which I like. &nbsp;There&#39;s also some nice printing on the center console of the bike featuring a speedometer (with cat ears!) above a grill design with purple flames on either side.</p>

<p>There&#39;s some&nbsp;simple architectural detail&nbsp;on the storefront model&nbsp;such as the green / white awning above the door. &nbsp;Having never built Lego architecture models, I found it interesting to see how a few simple pieces could make the store look more &#39;lived-in&#39;.</p>

<p>I ended up with a decent selection of spare pieces at the end including extra purple and yellow utility belts and a spare printed console for the motorcycle.</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>Robin&#39;s&nbsp;upper half is printed&nbsp;with the &#39;R&#39; on the front and a utility belt&nbsp;front and back. &nbsp;The legs are bare with printed red boots, front, side, and back. &nbsp;I found it a little odd that he wasn&#39;t provided with a separate utility belt add-in like Batgirl and Catwoman. &nbsp;You can always use the spare yellow belt that comes with the set but then technically he&#39;s wearing&nbsp;two belts - which would be very difficult since he&#39;s not wearing&nbsp;pants.</p>

<p>Batgirl&nbsp;has nice printed detail front / back, top / bottom. &nbsp;The&nbsp;little ponytail piece that attaches to a peg on the rear of her cowl&nbsp;is a nice touch but it&#39;s&nbsp;popped off several times during&nbsp;play. &nbsp;She comes with two yellow Batarangs.</p>

<p>Catwoman&#39;s upper half is printed front / back and her lower half is printed front only.The detail of her cowl looks good but I find it a little too large in proportion to her head. &nbsp;When is place, it covers her entire face including most of her mouth. &nbsp;This may have been necessary to achieve the look of the cowl and it&#39;s only a minor note. &nbsp;She comes with two whips and looks quite good overall.</p>

<p>All minifigs have alternate facial expressions&nbsp;as is typical these days. &nbsp;The look and&nbsp;colour palette for Batgirl and Catwoman&nbsp;is quite similar (aside from the cape of course) so I find myself having to correct my 5-year old frequently during play. &nbsp;I know he doesn&#39;t care but I just can&#39;t let it go :)</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>The build is quick and easy as is typical for the starter-type sets. &nbsp;Total time about 20 minutes.</p>

<h3>Models</h3>

<p>All models are well put together and hold up well to play.</p>

<p>The motorcycle has a great&nbsp;line and sits nice and low. &nbsp;It stays on its wheels well due&nbsp;to the outside struts. &nbsp;I find the purple headlight and single brake light set it apart as a villain&#39;s ride. &nbsp;No stud shooters or other action features.</p>

<p>The storefront looks great and is easy to access for play. &nbsp;The store has a nice, classy look like a jewelry store should while the (collapsible) streetlight, garbage can, and wanted poster on the side of the structure create a nice back-alley feel.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>A nice little set that provides solid play value, three nicely-executed minifigs, and a good introduction to the Lego Batman line. &nbsp;I think the price point is pretty much on the nose with this set and I&#39;d recommend it.</p>

<p>I think this set also lends itself nicely to display. &nbsp;Having Catwoman inside the store taking a jewel with a panicked Robin looking in the window and pointing looks pretty funny.</p>

"TroublesBrewing","2017-01-06T23:47:41.553Z","Minifigure set with a cool Catcycle and a small vignette ","<p>With a new Batman series of sets you better believe there will be a motorcycle and double points if its for Catwoman.</p>

<p>First off this is basically&nbsp;a minifigure 3 pack with an added vehicle and small vignette play set. So lets dive right in...</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The LEGO Company has gone all out on the detail in The Batman Movie minifigures and this set is is a perfect example. Both Catwoman&nbsp;and Batgirl have awesome detail in their arm and leg&nbsp;printing. The inclusion of side buckles on Batgirls boots is a nice touch and a node to the current comic book version. Two color molding looks great for Batgirls legs, but really shines with both Robins legs and arms. Oh, and lets not forget about the utility belts. Such a great addition to the minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>Vehicle</strong></p>

<p>The Catcycle! For a small build it is very well built and has&nbsp;a nice Bat-pod feel to it. The printed tiles have great detail and put the finishing touches on this&nbsp;great little motorcycle. The build technics are impressive for&nbsp;such a small set. The construction takes advantage of the wide wheels so the cycle stays up right.</p>

<p><strong>Vignette/Play Set</strong></p>

<p>Okay, this is the weakest part of the set, but not as bad as other sets. No printed parts, but a few stickers. I&#39;m okay with the sticker on the door and the store sign, but the 2x2 tile should have been printed. The jewelry store is naturally&nbsp;a&nbsp;good choice for a Catwoman set and for the minimal amount of pieces involved looks pretty good. It has&nbsp;the right&nbsp;amount play, but&nbsp;lacks in&nbsp;display value. However at this size you really can&#39;t complain.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>As I stated already, this is a minifigure&nbsp;set and&nbsp;you will not be disappointed in them. Taking into account that minifigures run $3.99 USD a piece, that leaves the remaining piece count just under 6 cents a piece. That&#39;s&nbsp;a pretty good value.</p>

"redbeardlegoman","2017-04-15T04:46:47.017Z","The Nearly-Annual Catcycle Chase - Now With a Bigger Bike","<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>In this wave&#39;s almost inevitable Catcycle&nbsp;Chase we&#39;ve got a very different Catwoman, a much larger bike with some cool parts, a small shop, and a remarkable lack of Batman.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot of fun, action packed shots on the box.<br />
That&#39;s possibly the second-most I&#39;ve ever said about the packaging.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The printed 1x1 half-round tiles, the printed gas tank, and the yellow batarangs are great parts. &nbsp;I&#39;m not sure if the longer brick-work bricks are new, but I like them a lot. &nbsp;I am intrigued by the new mask for Batgirl. &nbsp;I like that the pony tail now stands back far enough to stop from mashing the cape. &nbsp;I wonder what future applications are going to come with the separate hair piece.</p>

<p>For a set with less than 150 parts, it comes with 16 extra pieces - among which are one of each coloured utility belt, two awesome yellow batarangs, a whip and a printed piston tile. &nbsp;Sweet!</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>I would have bought the set simply as a low-cost way to get a Batgirl. &nbsp;I love this Batgirl. &nbsp;Lots of printing, particularly the straps on the sides of the&nbsp;dual molded boots, a very interesting two part helmet that doesn&#39;t mash down the cape. &nbsp;I even like the bright purple and yellow colour scheme, and those sweet yellow batarangs.</p>

<p>This Catwoman, too, is a bold departure from the usual black... well... catsuit, and a well-done one at that. &nbsp;The rounded shape of the mask does something funny to the old masks - it makes them bother me in ways they never did before. &nbsp;Now I look at them, and feel they are bluntly shortened to their detriment. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh, yeah, and there&#39;s Robin. &nbsp;I like this Robin, even though I generally hate Robin (considering him to be the absolute worst thing about anything Batman). &nbsp;As I wrote in a review of the 70905 Batmobile, this Robin looks good enough to make me happy with him. &nbsp;But that doesn&#39;t make him not Robin. &nbsp;But, for a relatively low price, you can have nearly the complete Bat Family (because it&#39;s almost guaranteed that you have a Batman by now. &nbsp;People that have never seen another piece of Lego in their lives probably have a Batman by now.).</p>

<p>And there is no Batman. &nbsp;I kept looking. &nbsp;He wasn&#39;t in the spare parts. &nbsp;He wasn&#39;t hiding in the green trash can. &nbsp;I&#39;ve dug the empty bags out of the trash twice, just in case I&#39;d accidentally thrown him out, but he&#39;s not there.</p>

<p>If I had only one complaint (other than Robin&#39;s presence) it would be that while the masks have succeeded in eliminating the strange sweatband on all the Batman minifigures, the eye holes still don&#39;t seem to match up properly with the printed face. &nbsp;If you press the helmets all the way down, the eyebrows and mouths are essentially hidden, and the two expressions per head are rendered pointless. &nbsp;You can have the expressions show through, and still match up providing the pull the masks back up just a little bit.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Most of the build is dedicated to the beefy Catcycle. &nbsp;This is a big (literally) change from the usual bike-with-purple-fairing. &nbsp;Lego dimensions are weird. &nbsp;You have to accept things like car panels being as thick as the walls in a house. &nbsp;And that also means you have a motorcycle the relative length of an ocean kayak. &nbsp;Size notwithstanding the bike is pretty cool. &nbsp;It&#39;s a Harley in a world of Suzukis (not that I have anything against either). &nbsp;The printed pistons and gas tank are fantastic. &nbsp;The bike itself looks like it&#39;s all pipes and horsepower.</p>

<p>I might change out the tan pins for blue ones, to make the colours more consistent (or black), but that&#39;s a simple fix for them as are bothered.</p>

<p>The little jewel shop makes up the rest of the build, and takes no time at all. &nbsp;Considering that it&#39;s just a wee vignette shop, it does well with a small piece count and area. It&#39;s a good starting point, too, for those who like to extend the playsets to fit in with their town plan full of hulking modulars.</p>

<p>The stickers are two passes and one fail. &nbsp;I imagine that printing tiles is more expensive than stickers. &nbsp;Having said that, I&#39;d much rather have the stickers on the shop than on the bike. &nbsp;The missing kitten sign works well with the cat theme of the set, and would provide an excellent detail in City MOCs. &nbsp;I also like the diamond kitty head shop sign. &nbsp;Another acceptably over-the-top nod to the essential character of The Catwoman.<br />
<br />
The fail of a sticker though, is the closed sign. &nbsp;I can&#39;t say that I like having to decide between not applying the sticker, and having a permanently closed shop.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t want to apply the sticker to the door. &nbsp;However, since I am reviewing my daughter&#39;s set (two weren&#39;t quite in the budget this time around), I had to defer to her desires, and she wanted it on.</p>

<p>When I do get my own, I will keep it off the door until I can find a way to apply it to a movable sign. &nbsp;It&#39;s not a bad detail, but I&#39;m not satisfied with the current options for application.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>I like the ridiculously long bike. &nbsp;The shop is decent enough. &nbsp;The minifigures are justification for buying the set on their own.</p>

<p>It&#39;s instantly playable for the little ones, and the bike is structurally sound enough to actually be run along the floor.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>Great set. &nbsp;Get it. &nbsp;Get it now. &nbsp;Buy two. &nbsp;I should have. &nbsp;I will.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Purple is not nearly such a hot commodity anymore these days, but there are some nice pieces in it.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Robin- Such a goofy and fun take on the character. His hair/goggles piece has a lot of character, especially due to his nervous squint in this set,&nbsp;and I like how classic his uniform is. His cape is nice, and has a metallic finish on one side.</p>

<p>Batgirl- Also very classic, but in a different way. This version is essentially an update of the original Batgirl from the 60&#39;s show, which is convenient for those disappointed by her absence in said Batcave. Her cowl is a new piece and it has an interesting peg system for her ponytail to attach to. I feel like the ponytail is a bit too small and flat, as it has to be angled out to be seen. Underneath, we see her face, which has slightly skewed proportions to fit through the cowl&#39;s&nbsp;eyeholes. I wonder why they decided that was necessary, instead of just molding the mask better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her uniform is standard Batfamily fare, in the classic purple and yellow, and she has the new utility belt as well as a metallic cape, but in the Batman cut.</p>

<p>Catwoman- Also an updated return to the roots, as she too has gone back to her original purple. The design is very hard to parse from a distance (which may be the point), but it looks good up close. She has a new Cat-cowl, and her green goggles can be seen underneath. Both of her faces feature these goggles, and her expressions are angry and confident. Her skin seems a bit darker, but I&#39;m not sure if that&#39;s because it&#39;s printed on darker plastic or because her race has been changed like the Gordons.&nbsp;I feel like it&#39;s&nbsp;very hard to see her mouth when she wears the mask, although I suspect that&#39;s also intentional. She also has the utility belt, but in purple, and her typical whip. This version of her in full costume is exclusive to this set.</p>

<p>First up is a tiny jewelry shop that begs to be robbed with its cat-diamond logo. It&#39;s&nbsp;basically just a display for the jewels, but I appreciate the awning and the cat-up-a-tree poster on the side. A light pole is attached, and it can be adjusted for various degrees of damage.</p>

<p>Catwoman&#39;s&nbsp;motorcycle is the main build, and it&#39;s properly built up from scratch this time. I like the machinery details, and how rugged&nbsp;and thrown-together it feels. The wheels are clever, too, as they&#39;re unevenly mounted, but rest level when the vehicle is on the ground.</p>

<h3>Overall?</h3>

<p>This is essentially a glorified minifigure pack, but it&#39;s a good one. I feel like the repetitive-Catwoman-set format is part of the movie&#39;s&nbsp;&quot;new twist on an old classic&quot; joke here, and the two models are decent little things.</p>

"Khscarymovie","2017-08-04T21:48:43.867Z","A Great Set From A Great Theme","<p>The Lego Batman Movie had an incredible first wave, and I believe this is one of the finest&nbsp;sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The minifigures here are are some of the most colourful I have ever seen. First up we have Robin, this version of Robin might be the best ever, his hair piece connects to his glasses so you can&#39;t use the hair for something else unless you use the glasses. Next we have Batgirl, this version is similar to the 1960s tv show version, which is fitting as she was missing from the 1960s Batcave last&nbsp;year. Last we have Catwomen, who is the perfect enemy for Batgirl as they both covered in purple. This is by far the best version of Catwomen we have had so far. This version of Catwomen is exclusive to this set, but you can get Robin and Batgirl in more expensive sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The first build is Catwomens&nbsp;motorcycle, this is the third time we have gotten a Catwomen motorcycle , and it is by far the best. Insted of using a simple cycle piece it is brickbuilt and it looks great. I love the little bits of purple in the bike. The other build is a store that contains 2 diamonds. I always love small builds like this, it reminds me of something I would build when I was younger. There is a street light that is the only play feature in the entire set, this might be disappointing&nbsp;to some. The help poster on the side of he shop is a nice touch.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>Overall I think this is a very nice set and one of my favorites from the amazing Lego Batman Movie theme. He minifigures are incredible and the builds are great, there are not many play functions which may disappoint some of the younger Lego fans. The price is also really good.&nbsp;</p>

"Hashem1983","2018-06-30T18:48:53.423Z","It's All about the Purple Bike and the Figuers","<p>I bought this set almost a year ago (from the time I am writing this review), I would also like to say and what I felt about the whole &ldquo;Lego Batman Movie&rdquo; was all about getting the characters from the Batman line (at least in my own opinion) but still it has some great playable sets. I won&rsquo;t go into deep detailed review and I will make it as short as possible.</p>

<p>This set offers great and important mini-figures, Catwoman, Robin and Batgirl, with decent builds, most importantly Catwoman&rsquo;s purple bike, I liked it sleek simple design that its build was different than the 76053: Gotham City Cycle Chase and it relied mostly by using the technic pieces, the only thing I added into it were flames coming out from the exhaust of the bike.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a side simple build for a jewelry store that you can build without looking into the instructions, however I used those parts for my personal build.</p>

<p>Overall opinion, it is a nice set to collect great figures with a decent build and playability.</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2020-05-06T20:57:34.56Z","She’s at it again with the diamond stealing huh?","<p>So, I bought this set recently at a store where it sat on the shelves for 3 years now, it sure did take me a while to buy it. I&rsquo;m REALLY glad I picked up this set, I seriously don&rsquo;t know why it took me so long to get it as one of the few Lego Batman Movie sets I saw on store shelves and never bought, luckily for me, no one bought it and I was able to enjoy this set for myself.</p>

<h3>The Builds</h3>

<p><strong>The Catcycle:</strong>&nbsp;obviously the best part of the main bike build is that IT&rsquo;S NOT A TYPICAL 20 DOLLAR LICENSED OVERSIZED BIKE SET! It&rsquo;s unbelievable that for once, Lego made a realistically sized brick built&nbsp;bike that was at a good scale compared to a minifigure. Not only was the sizing really good, but I was impressed with how the whole bike is built and with good detail put into it. There were quite a few Technic pieces going into the frame of the bike. The seating area can fit Catwoman just fine, next to it are 2 exhaust pipes on either side that could be moved up or down as they&rsquo;re attached on hinges.There&rsquo;s also a printed 2 by 2 slope piece with purple flames and a speedometer on it, which looks very awesome. A handle is also included for Catwoman to hold while driving it, in front of where the handle is attached is where a headlight could be found. Overall, a really awesome bike, I have no problems with it whatsoever.</p>

<p><strong>The Diamond&nbsp;Store:</strong>&nbsp;I thought the side build of the set was gonna be plain and boring, but it definitely surprised me on how much I enjoyed it. There was a 12 by 6 grey plate piece as the base. Next to the diamond store is a trash can in green, a nice help poster with a cat on it as a sticker on the wall to the side of the shop and a lamppost (it&rsquo;s shown as the only play feature of the set to knock down the lamppost, it&rsquo;s not the most exciting thing, but it works for what it is). The door has a nice sticker on it that says closed and next to it is a clear panel piece to display the diamonds. Not much is going on in the interior, just a clear and translucent red diamond to be found. At the top, the store sign is attached by a clip and the sign itself uses a 2 by 4 tile with a sticker that has a gem that looks like a cat on it which looks nice. Next to the sign is a little awning build with dark green and white 1 by 1 cheese slopes, and it makes the store look a little more complete than it actually is, which I like. Overall,&nbsp;it&rsquo;s not an amazing or perfect side build that&nbsp;definitely could&#39;ve&nbsp;been expanded upon and it&#39;s the weakest part of the set,&nbsp;but still pretty nice.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs</h3>

<p><strong>Catwoman:</strong>&nbsp;Wow, what an amazing figure, this is by far the best version of Catwoman Lego Made. The legs and torso have a lot of silver shine to it (also on the back of the torso&nbsp;and the beautiful arm printing)which looks amazing. She also comes with a utility belt in purple, which looks very cool. For her facial expressions, she has a confident smile and an angry expression as the alternate face, both very nice expressions. Her mask was a new piece, it has ears on top of it and an impression of goggles going around the mask. She comes with a whip as her accessory, overall a very impressive figure that&rsquo;s definitely a big draw to get this set, it sucks that she&rsquo;s not exclusive though (figure also came in set 70923).</p>

<p><strong>Batgirl:</strong>&nbsp;While she&rsquo;s not difficult to get in the line, she&rsquo;s still a really amazingly detailed minifigure and I didn&rsquo;t mind getting my second duplicate of this figure. A lot effort was put into this figure which I really appreciate, I like the side leg printing for the boots of the dual-molded legs and arm printing for the continuation of the suit design. She has the common yellow utility belt piece, her front and back torso printing was also very good. The cape is a different material to the soft one, it has a shine to it that looks awesome. Her facial expressions have a happy and angry expression and the mask was a well made piece that could attach Batgirl&rsquo;s hair using a peg connection. She also comes with 2 yellow batarangs as her accessories, overall nothing exclusive but still a great figure.</p>

<p><strong>Robin:</strong>&nbsp;He pretty much has the same deal as the Batgirl minifig from this set, nothing hard to get or exclusive but still nice to get in a cheaper set. he has dual molded legs that have red boots and his torso printing has the Robin logo and printed yellow utility belt which is carried on to the back. The material of his cape was also the same as Batgirl&rsquo;s with the same shine to it. He&rsquo;s got a happy facial expression and a worried one for the alternate face. His hair/glasses combo was a really nice piece as well. Overall a great figure and it&rsquo;s nice to get in a cheaper set.</p>

<h3>Value For Money</h3>

<p>The value of the set is pretty decent, you get 3 awesome minifigs and 2 great builds, and what&rsquo;s included here feels&nbsp;enough to make a play scene but perhaps the value would&#39;ve been perfect if the diamond store was bigger, so not perfect but still decent.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This a really great set that gives you an amazing twist to the awful oversized 20 dollar bike sets with a genuinely good bike. The 3 figures you get here are phenomenal (especially Catwoman), and the diamond store was a cute little side build. I highly recommend getting this set if you find it for a good price online, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a really nice&nbsp;set, all things included here were fun and awesome.</p>
