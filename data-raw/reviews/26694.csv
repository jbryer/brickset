First off I must say I don&#39;t normally take time to write reviews, but&nbsp;this set is absolutely fantastic and I felt compelled to do so! Now I know that may come across as extremely biased in a positive way, but rest assured, all is not rose colored!</p>

<p>This set comes with 305 pieces, and two minifigures! I picked this set up at Target here in the States for $29.99.</p>

<p>The Box:</p>

<p>I love the design and artwork&nbsp;Lego has done for the boxes for TLBM sets. All TLBM sets&nbsp;come in a&nbsp;nice shiny box with good pictures of the sets, which show many ideas for playability. This box size&nbsp;is about average for a set in this price range. Inside you&#39;ll find two bags, and two instruction booklets. The first bag contains the Batman figure, and the second bag contains The Penguin.</p>

<p>Minifigs:</p>

<p>The two minifigs included are spectacular. We get alot of Batman in this wave, as he is included in almost every set released. Still, it never gets old getting the Dark Knight himself in a set! I have purchased two sets of this wave, and so far both Batman figures have had different facial expressions. I&#39;m not sure if that is going to be the case in each set, but I was pleased to see this trend so far, as it makes each Batman feel different, and not feel like you are getting the same thing in each set.This Batman gets two different expressions, and several batarangs. Of course the awesome new utility belt is included, as well as the new softer cape. All in all, I really like this version of Batman. I can&#39;t say enough about the Penguin minifigure. I love the new collar piece that he wears, and his expression is perfect. His tophat&nbsp;&quot;tops&quot; off his appearance, and the new umbrella piece is a great addition.</p>

<p>This set itself was a delight to put together. I completed the set in about 45 minutes, while taking my time, so it comes together quickly. The build was enjoyable and fun all the way through. It was really cool to see it come together. The Lego Master Builder for this set gets a 10 from me! This is an awesome set for play and display! Of course you get the two spring loaded shooters in the front, and in the rear of the vehicle, the trunk lifts up to reveal a get- away boat for the penguin. This little craft is very small and made up of minimal pieces, but it gets the job done. It definitely adds to the playability. The top comes off of the driver area, and the penguin can fit down inside standing up, top hat and all! The car itself is fantastic. In my opinion, this style fits the Penguin perfectly. It looks like a 1920s-30s luxury coupe of some sort, and definitely suits the Penguin&#39;s personality. The use of the two hot air balloon pieces to form the front fenders of the car was very well done. All in all, I just can&#39;t rave about the vehicle design enough!</p>

<p>The issues I have with the set are few and far between. With that being said, the axle for the front wheels does not spin freely. There is quite a bit of friction due to the way it is built, but it is not enough to be a problem. Also, the little escape boat is so small of a build it almost seems just tacked on to add some kind of extra playability factor. i see the point it serves, and it does add to the playability, but it would have been nice to see something a little more built up. It would have also been nice to get another figure, or at least a small penguin or two to go along with this set. However, these small gripes are not enough to put a damper on my opinion of this fine set.</p>

<p>All in all, I would HIGHLY recommend this set. The price is right, and it definitely has enough features to ensure playability, and it also&nbsp;looks great as a display piece!&nbsp;Lego definitely did this one right. In my opinion, if you are a Batman fan, a Penguin fan, a fan of older cars, or just like unique models, you can&#39;t go wrong with this set. Pick one up!</p>

<p>This is really the only lacking part of this set. Batman is the same one in almost every lego Batman set however the penguin is a really good figure and a great update to the old ones. Adding a penguin or two might have made this better.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are so many great parts in this set. The way they use balloon pieces on the side of the car makes it look very slick. The penguin comes with an umbrella which is a good price to have and is very useful. There are several more but these are the ones that stick out.</p>

<p><b>Playability</b></p>

<p>There are some good play features like a gun in the front and an escape in the back. The escape in the back makes it where the penguin can&#39;t drive the car. The play features fit nicely into the vehicle&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Final verdict</b></p>

<p>The best part may be its price only $30 for 308. This is my favorite lego Batman the movie set!</p>
