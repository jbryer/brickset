<p><br />
<strong>Minifigs</strong>:<br />
1. Batman: The Batman figure is different from the other Batman Movie Batman&#39;s because of the lack of a utility belt piece. This is so that the black wings can be attached securely. Other than the different torso print the figure is similar to the other figures. Batman comes with a small jetpack build attaching the torpedo pieces to the back of the glider. The glider piece was exclusive to the 2013&#39;s Arkham Asylum so its nice to get it in a cheap set. For an enhanced effect, flame pieces are added.<br />
2. Scarecrow: The figure is different from the one in the Special Delivery set due to the new hat and torso design. The hat and hair combo is from the series 14 witch and is dual molded in dark brown and pale yellow with a patch print. The face is very intimidating and suits Scarecrow. I particularly like the face with his mouth exposed. The torso design features a simple brown coat with some exposed straw. There is some more patch printing on either arm. The legs are impressive as well using sand blue as the base colour. The legs have more brown printing as well as the rope continuation and some boot detailing.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong>:<br />
1. Gyrocopter: The copter is a wacky build very suited to Scarecrow. It features a disproportionate horizontal stabilizer with a huge central propeller. The stabilizer has a graffiti design of a pumpkin on both sides which is an excellent detail. There are two broomsticks used to keep the copter airbound. On either side attached via brown stud guns are two massive fear bombs. These have a orange head inside. There is a comfy seat for Scarecrow to sit and pilot the vehicle.<br />
2. Mini Power Plant: The power plant is a fun little build intended to be placed among the other power plant builds from the Batman Movie sets. It features a small slot to place one of the aforementioned fear bombs inside and a small simple exploding feature will occur blasting the power plant. A fun feature that will delight kids for sure!</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong>:<br />
This set is perfect. Cheap, good minifigs and a decent build is the perfect package. I bought it on a sale but would not hesitate to buy it at full price and I recommend that you do too!</p>

<p><strong><em>Rating: 5/5</em></strong></p>

<p>This is a nice little set, a fun and quick build with good&nbsp;(and unique) minifigs. There is a little additional structure that can be blown up (always nice). Scarecrow&#39;s gyrocopter has two bombs it can drop, and rotors that work. Unfortunately the undercarriage might be someone delicate, using droid-arms. Personally I consider this set good value for money.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The total build took some 20-25 minutes in total. It is quick, with 5 stickers to apply. Two of them extremely visible (the pumpkin faces on the tail), and two rather tricky to apply (the manifolds on the engine - a curved surface). The designer used some clever techniques, in particular for attaching the engine to the undercarriage of the gyrocopter. The skis seem to be old Fabuland&nbsp;brooms. The bombs are released through studshooters, in a nice brown recolour.</p>

<p>The exploding factory platform is rather dime-a-dozen, but adds a nice play feature to the set. The sand-green coloured&nbsp;pieces and the red macaroni piece might be useful&nbsp;for other builds.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>Both Scarecrow and this version of Batman are - apparently - unique. Batman has wings (neck-piece) and no&nbsp;utility belt. Attached to the wings is a rocket pack (a nice build), that even has&nbsp;red striping common to Batman vehicles. He also has a grappling hook shooter (not workable) to attack Scarecrow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Personally I like the Scarecrow figure. Just like Batman, it has two faces, although the expressions IMHO are fairly similar. There is nice printing on the front and back of his torso, as well as his arms. The print is carried on on the legs. The hat and hair are one piece. Overall a pretty good figure.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>As said, the gyrocopter is a nice built, quirky and suits Scarecrow in style and design (both shape and colours). The designer made great use of some unusual pieces to capture shapes, and create the engine compartment. Getting Scarecrow seated, and then holding the steering bars is somewhat tricky (getting figure seated properly, and the hands lined up, without detaching the steering from the gyrocopter). It is tight, but works.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This is a play set, that is clear. The gyrocopter itself is too small to serve as a standalone display piece, and the exploding factory floor (which works quite well), the bomb-launchers and the Batman with rocket pack and wings clearly invite play. However, holding the gyrocopter without inadvertently launching the bombs might be tricky - especially if you wish to spin the rotor blades. Also the droid arms are somewhat delicate, and will probably break during rougher play.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>I was positively surprised by this set, and definitely consider it good value for money - not in the least because of the minifigures. Without them this set might be a little overpriced, but the whole package is definitely worth it.</p>

<p>Finally the classic-version Scarecrow! Even though the pizza delivery version was funny, this one keeps track with the classic look of the character, and the minifigure here is very cool.&nbsp;Almost every villain in this Batman wave has a car, so with the Scarecrow having a flying vehicle, even if it&#39;s very simple, it&#39;s pretty refreshing to me! His gyro-copter is pretty nice, not very stable but has some nice stickers and two cool fear gas bomb-shooters pointed down on the streets! You could give them in his hands as a gun, but that way they&#39;re just too&nbsp;big, but the set gives you also a black gun as a spare part that i use as his personal weapon!!</p>

<p>Batman here it&#39;s different from other sets of the line. He&#39;s&nbsp;got what&#39;s probably my favourite&nbsp;bat-jetpack-wings&nbsp;with rotating flames (instead of the usual cape, belt and batarang, all non included) and his grappling gun, both very sweet to chase the Scarecrow!!</p>

<p>The set also include a tiny power plant mini build, with the same design colours&nbsp;as other sets of the wave, so it&#39;s pretty easy to combine them together. But even on his own it works pretty well, with an explode function for a fear gas bomb.</p>

<p>So the set&nbsp;gives a lot of playability, and all the different builds are something&nbsp;refreshingly&nbsp;different from the other sets of the wave (Scarecrow vehicle and Batman flying suit)&nbsp;but also perfectly compatible for enlarging your Gotham city (the power plant)!&nbsp;And now i&#39;m gonna play some street chase!!</p>

"KoolKreeper489","2018-11-16T04:53:21.407Z","Scarecrow Fearful Face-off Review","<p>The Scarecrow Fearful Face-off set is a good small set for The Lego Batman Movie theme. It includes Scarecrows helicopter, a side build, and 2 minifigures. It was released in 2017 for&nbsp;$14.99 and has 141 pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><strong>Batman- </strong>This version of Batman&nbsp;is similar to most of the Batman minifigures in The Lego Batman Movie theme but this one includes wings. Otherwise it is pretty basic but still good. 7/10</p>

<p><strong>Scarecrow-</strong> There have been many Scarecrow minifigures released but in my opinion this is the best one. The printing is great and the hat with the straw coming out was also on the Scarecrow from 2016 but this one is lighter. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Scarecrows helicopter is small but still has a cool design. The uses of brooms for the landing skids is a great design choice. The side build doesn&#39;t really add anything to the set. The fear gas bombs attached to stud shooters are&nbsp;a great play feature. 9.5/10</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>This set is small but that isn&#39;t a bad thing. The minifigures are great and the helicopter has a cool design that fits Scarecrow, but the side build seems pointless. Scarecrow is one of my favorite Batman super villains and I like most of the sets he is in and this is definitely one of the good ones. If you want a small cheap set then I recommend getting this one.</p>
