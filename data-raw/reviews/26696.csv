<p>Bane&#39;s Toxic Truck Attack was one of those sets in the Lego Batman Movie line that I was willing to pass up, mostly due to its ridiculous price. Yes, there is a very nice Lego BigFig included, but the set simply did not look worth the over 50 euros&nbsp;that it is sold for. When I came across it at 25% off, I decided to pick it up, however. There is only one unique minifig, which is compensated for by the Bane BigFig. Bane&#39;s ATV is nice, while Batman&#39;s &#39;whatever&#39;-copter is quirky. Getting the stud-shooter loaded might be tricky. Bane can be fixed to the ATV, but seems to come off fairly easily. Overall, I think this is a nice play set, but not at this price.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build is easy, and quick. I took me about an hour, easy pace, and taking my time for the stickers. There are 13 of those, and all easy to apply, IMHO. Batman&#39;s flying machine is a small little and fun build. Bane&#39;s ATV is built around two technic bars. Though IMHO no truly remarkable building techniques were used, it was still nice to see how with relatively few pieces a quite impressive vehicle is&nbsp;built.&nbsp;Bane&#39;s backpack and the toxic waste chemical launcher is are OK&nbsp;builds. Overall, an easy build that an 8 year old should be able to complete. The most tricky part was getting the studs into the shooter.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>This rendition of Batman is found in 5 other sets, so is far from unique. The unique minifigure in this set is the Mutant Leader. This minifig&nbsp;pretty much looks like a mini-Bane, with Cyclops&#39; eye-wear. His torso-print (front and back is nice and detailed. As he is bald, he only as a single but very nice face print. The third figure included in this set is the Bane BigFig. And frankly, in combination with the back-pack that provides him with the chemicals he needs to survive, he is awesome. He looks as menacing as the Bane from the movies.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Batman&#39;s &#39;whatever&#39;-copter is a fun, and actually quite well finished. It has a bit of a &#39;James Bond&#39;s contraption by Q&#39; feel to it, but works well. The biggest negative I found is the use of a blue pin to hold the fork that holds the batarang. The canister launcher is well designed, and well finished. There are two spare canisters included, which is nice. Bane&#39;s ATV suits him: basic and&nbsp;rugged. The rear suspension is extremely simple but effective: a pivoting technic bar. I like the colour scheme (the bright orange) and the chemical tank at the back. Bane can stand in the back, while the Mutant Leader can serve as driver. The stickers work well, and definitely add to the overall look of the vehicle. There are two types of projectiles for he stud-shooter provided: simple studs, and more bullet-like constructions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>Overall, this is clearly a play set, and should provide a lot fun. The canister launcher works well. The ATV handles easily, and travels well over all kinds of surfaces. The stud-shooter&nbsp;works OK, and Bane posed on the ATV looks impressive. This set is clearly not a display set, although Bane&#39;s ATV looks impressive enough to serve as one (perhaps in a line-up of vehicles of villains).</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this is quite a good set, that offers quite a lot of play value. The BigFig&nbsp;is very nice and impressive. The ATV looks good, with the striking colours, as well as the vats and canisters containing the toxin. The big problem, IMHO is its price. Yeah, BigFigs are expensive, but IMHO the full retail price is still not justified, at least not in euros and pounds (and even in dollars). This feels more like a 35 to 40 euro set at best (both in piece count and in volume). At full price, I would hesitate to pick it up. At a significant discount, I would say: go for it.</p>

"Kaisermighe","2018-09-08T16:54:03.983Z","""Instead, i will simply break you!""","<p>First off let&#39;s face it. Bane is awesome. This is the first set released with&nbsp;bigfig&nbsp;Bane, and i like it a lot! As a fan of the comic, i can tell the design it&#39;s a mediation between the classical naked and masked from the 90s and the &quot;Dark knight rises&quot; movie version with the fur jacket, and i love it! All the details about it are great: and that&#39;s important since everybody wants this set just because it&#39;s the only way (for now) to have bigfig&nbsp;Bane.</p>

<p>Aside from him, you get just 2 minifig, the usual Lego Batman&nbsp;movie&#39;s Batman (here with a little silly&nbsp;gyrocopter) and the all-new Mutant leader!! Coming directly from &quot;The dark knight returns&quot; comic of 1986, this dude is really a lovely and unexpected&nbsp;addition&nbsp;to this villain&#39;s wave!!</p>

<p>And finally the biggest thing of the set (in terms of bricks number only), Bane&#39;s truck. The design of this big car&nbsp;reminds me of Agents sets of some years ago, with orange combining with toxic lime tankards. And although it&#39;s very simple and forgettable, it&#39;s very funny! There&#39;s a lot of playability, having a 6-stud shooters gun with viewfinder for Bane to use from the back, there&#39;s also room for the toxic tank in the back (which of course Bane can lift and throw&nbsp;at Batman), also you can put inside a nice chemical tank (with a good playfeature&nbsp;that catapults&nbsp;gas away)&nbsp;and in the end&nbsp;there&#39;s just enough space left to put the Mutant leader to drive the thing! Also it&#39;s a little asymmetrical so that pushing on the toxic tankard there&#39;s some suspension system, it just works fine.</p>

<p>The common retail price is not very good, i suggest to go for 30 euros or less because Bane, while being very very cool, doesn&#39;t worth so much, and all the other stuff you get is quite forgettable, although funny. Except the Mutant leader, i love this guy!</p>

"Capit√°n_Skrall","2019-08-29T15:00:17.39Z","Rugged looks and clever ideas","<p>This set was released in the second wave of the theme and it&nbsp;stands out as it is the only one to include Bane in the big-fig format,&nbsp;an anticipated character appearing in the promotional pictures of the movie. Yet, the set&nbsp;does not rely on this strong selling point and it even integrates this&nbsp;figure in&nbsp;order to create a very interesting and interactive story.</p>

<p>Bane is a fantastic figure here, with cartoonish&nbsp;size as the comics and videogames depicted him and its body and mask are intricately sculpted and printed, it even includes a coat just as seen in The Dark Knight Rises movie.&nbsp;The Mutant Leader, a famous character from The Dark Knight Returns graphic novel (go read it kids), is included and it looks appropriate with the printed visor and creepy teeth. Finally, another Batman is included as pretty much every other set from the theme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build starts with a container-launcher, a 30-piece simple mechanism that allows to launch&nbsp;some brick-built containers with an&nbsp;internal catapult mechanism; the build does not stand out but it works properly and&nbsp;has a believable industrial look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Whirly-Bat flyer is a fun addition. The single-seat helicopter leaves Batman quite exposed to the several flying and shooting weapons from Bane and Mutant Leader, which is great when two or more children play with the set. It is built&nbsp;with less than 40 pieces, it is sturdy and funny-looking. While I have a distaste for the looks of the&nbsp;rotor support made with&nbsp;technic connectors, they&nbsp;at least serve to hold&nbsp;a batarang.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remaining near-300 pieces are used in&nbsp;the main build, a six-wheeled, rugged looking truck with&nbsp;orange accents; it is quite large considering the piece count which is indicative of an efficient design. While I enjoy the overall design, such as the use of the orange windscreen pieces as mudguards and the front section arrangement, it is not a particularly detailed model and it remains quite simplistic.&nbsp;It features&nbsp;pendular independent suspension in&nbsp;the back wheels, as they are connected in a swiveling technic&nbsp;liftarm. It also has a&nbsp;rotative machine gun on top&nbsp;which&nbsp;can swivel up and down,&nbsp;the use of the magnifying glass is just perfect and is fun to see the face of Bane augmented when looking at it.</p>

<p>The truck benefits from having&nbsp;Bane on top of it, it looks cohesive and very aggressive making it an attractive toy. Between the large container at the back and Bane there is a hollow space in the center section; while not pointed out as a feature in the manuals, I realized that it perfectly fits the remaining&nbsp;launchable containers. Besides being practical, the storaged containers&nbsp;look&nbsp;cohesive with the big default container and it also ties the truck and the container-launcher as one idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a very fun set that features an attractive&nbsp;design with cool aggressive looks making it a successful toy; also, it might be the only Lego set in which the rotative stud-shooter looks decent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
