<p>I bought this model for display and later took it apart and rebuilt it with my 6-year old nephew. Building it together took a while, but afterwards he played with it for days. It is a bit heavy, but has great swooshability, things to shoot with, can carry a car, and has nice minifigs. Although fairly expensive, it is IMHO a very good set and worth its money - both for play and display.</p>

<h2>Building experience</h2>

<p>Three minifigures are included, of which Harley&nbsp;Quinn is by far the most interesting figure of all, and the stud-cannon is a nice colourful addition. Batman is fairly standard, Robin as well (though only available in a limited number of sets).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building the Batwing was a lot of fun. The way the designers have incorporated the rotating engines into the structure of the aircraft is interesting. There is a decent variation in parts, the&nbsp;majority of them being black. The build itself is not too difficult - my 6-year old nephew was able to build the model, though the size of the build makes it a challenge to keep up the concentration for as long as needed. The attachment of the wings to the aircraft is fairly solid, though they might come off if you pick the model up by the wings. Hold the Batwing by its body, and everything should be fine. The griebling on top (between the gun and cockpit) is the most vulnerable, as the droid-arms used break fairly easily.</p>

<p>It took me some 2 or 3 hours to build the aircraft, together with my nephew it took about 4 or 5, spread out over a day.</p>

<p>There is a good number of stickers that need to be applied - some patience and Windex go a long way. To me, the stickers offer the model something extra; the red pin-striping, the name tag&nbsp; and the red leading edge of the wings definitely break up the monotony&nbsp;of an all-black vehicle. The disk-shooters and spring-loaded missiles under the wing are quite nicely incorporated. Robin&#39;s car - that can be carried in the loading bay of the Batwing -&nbsp;is a nice little build as well.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This is one of those models that makes for both a good display model and a good play-model. It is fairly big, but impressive - and has a number of nice angles to look at. One could even hang it on the wall, cockpit up, top facing out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a play-model, it is definitely swooshable, though a bit on the heavy side. The disk- and spring-loaded shooters, the cargo bay, the cockpit and moveable engines all are nice play features. Robin&#39;s buggy and Harley Quinn&#39;s studshooting gattling gun are nice and attractive additions. My nephew had so much fun with it that he asked me to get the Ultimate Batmobile next.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>All in all, I would say this is a very good model, well worth its price. It offers something to both adults and children alike in play and display value. The vehicle is sturdy enough to stand up to playing around it.&nbsp;Building the Batwing is a lot of fun, and it is one of those vehicles that have to be included in any collection of Batman vehicles.</p>
