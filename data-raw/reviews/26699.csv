<p>The bat signal is a nice added build. I like that the&nbsp;light up feature works.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The batmobile is awesome. I love that it can split into four different vehicles and I love the looks of all the vehicles&nbsp;</p>

<p>MINIFIGS</p>

<p>the minifigs&nbsp;look nice and are cool</p>

<p>Alfred looks really cool and I love that he gets a batsuit</p>

<p>&nbsp;Batman is okay because you can get him in almost every other set</p>

<p>batgirl&nbsp;and robin are&nbsp;also okay</p>

<p>Polka dot man is amazing I like the flying disc and his suit</p>

<p>wicked witch is a pretty good minifig</p>

<p>&nbsp;The flying monkeys are a really cool addition to this set</p>

<p>FINAL VERDICT&nbsp;</p>

<p>i think this set is a great set and highly recommend due to the build and minifigs</p>

"Moscadini","2017-07-20T23:47:51.643Z","Batman & His Ultimate Batmobile","<p>&bull; <strong>Building experience </strong>- challenging very little, but had to adapt the &#39;tank&#39; to be able to connect the tank to the batmobile.&nbsp; According to the instructions, it lays on top, but not fully... so, I had to add some pieces so that it is properly as seen in the picture.</p>

<p>&bull; <strong>Parts </strong>- All cool pieces</p>

<p>&bull; <strong>Minifigures </strong>- All great minifigures.&nbsp; I do enjoy the most of Polka Dot Man and the Wizard of Oz Monkeys</p>

<p>&bull; <strong>Vehicles </strong>-</p>

<ul>
	<li><em><strong>Batmobile </strong></em>(<em>Batman</em>) - Great build, however, the wheels in the front do not turn when &quot;playing&quot; with the car. (Bat Fins fall off too easy).&nbsp; Could have given the option to use a &quot;turning technic system&quot; for the front wheels</li>
	<li><em><strong>Bat Tank </strong></em>(<em>Bat-Alfred</em>) - Great built, love the multi-shooter, could use more &quot;controls&quot;</li>
	<li><em><strong>Bat Bike </strong></em>(<em>Robin</em>) - Easy build</li>
	<li><em><strong>Bat Jet </strong></em>(<em>Batgirl</em>) - Easy build, same issue as the batmobile where the fins fall off easy as well. Plane could use more controls as well.</li>
	<li><em><strong>Batsignal Light </strong></em>- Even if the &quot;bat signal&quot; decal is slightly off-centered, it works wonderful!&nbsp; I adapted to make the bat signal move up and down using two 2x3&#39;s instead of its original pieces of two 2x2&#39;s</li>
</ul>

<p>&bull; <strong>Playability </strong>- Be sure to use &quot;two hands&quot; on both the tank &amp; batmobile (or one hand toward the center of the combined batmobile) or both the tank &amp; batmobile will fall off from the three points of connection. The Batmobile could have given the option to use a &quot;turning technic system&quot; for the front wheels</p>

<p>&bull; <strong>Value For Money </strong>- Great for the value and a great build</p>

<p>&bull; <strong>Conclusion </strong>- A great build and a great addition to the Lego Batman Collection.&nbsp; I did enjoy building it... I believe this set is more as a &quot;collectable&quot; when all four vehicles are combined, and more &quot;playable&quot; when they are seperated. Overall, a great and fun build!</p>

"monkyby87","2018-05-21T16:27:21.377Z","Great set overall!","<p>In general I have enjoyed all of the Lego Batman Movie sets, more so than I thought I would.&nbsp; When I first saw images of this Ultimate Batmobile set, my first impression was that it&#39;s just a jumbled build of various Batman style vehicles.&nbsp; While that&#39;s partially true, it all works very well and is one of my favorite sets from the entire lineup.</p>

<p>The obvious selling point is that this Ultimate Batmobile is made up of 4 smaller Batman vehicles.&nbsp; As seen in the movie, this includes a regular Batmobile&nbsp;for Batman, a Batcycle for Robin, a Batplane for Batgirl, and a Bat tank&nbsp;for Alfred.&nbsp; These are all recreated very well when compared to the movie version, and each vehicle works very well on its own.&nbsp; That&#39;s the real highlight of this set.&nbsp; Often with toys like&nbsp;this, where smaller parts combine to form a bigger one, the individual parts are lackuster.&nbsp; That&#39;s not the case here.&nbsp; Each vehicle could serve as a small set on its own, and all have fun features.&nbsp; It&#39;s really pretty remarkable how well they all fit together to form the Ultimate Batmobile.</p>

<p>The mini-figures themselves are great too.&nbsp; It comes with Batman, Robin, Batgirl, Alfred in his Batman/Butler outfit, the Wicked Witch, Polka-dot-man, and two flying monkeys.&nbsp; In addition, there&#39;s a buildable Batsignal with a light brick.&nbsp; While the bat symbol is really only visible from near, it&#39;s a cool little feature and looks neat.</p>

<p>Overall I highly recommend this set.&nbsp; Individually and combined, this is an awesome set that looks great, plays great, and compliments all of the other Lego Batman Movie sets very well.</p>

"markliso","2017-11-19T17:23:30.957Z","Batman fun","<p>Overall, this is a great set with lots of figures.&nbsp; Love the bat signal (light up brick!).&nbsp; Purchased this for $130 (Canadian)&nbsp;after tax on sale at Indigo/Chapters.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Build:</p>

<p>Took me about 5-6 hours with my 4 year old daughter split over multiple sessions (both factors help slow it down). Came in 9 bags, the instructions were really nice quality as well (bound book).&nbsp; All the bags were assorted in a really nice fashion and just made the build a lot easier.&nbsp; Definitely can see why it&#39;s a 10-16 set, there are some Technic like qualities, which can require the steady hand.&nbsp;The most difficult aspect is more so that a lot of the pieces look the same (colour scheme), so I found myself doing some minor presorting after opening each bag just to make it a bit easier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>As mentioned above, a lot of the parts look the same, but there are quite a few unique pieces which make this set stand out.&nbsp; The wheels are amazing, the back ones are huge!&nbsp; The bat signal with the light up brick might even steal the show (it did with my 4 year old at first...).&nbsp; The multiple shooters, the nice purple pieces as well for the &quot;glow&quot; on the boosters.&nbsp;The bat wings.&nbsp; There are many great pieces.</p>

<p>Minifigs:</p>

<p>Picture shows everyone you are getting and was a big selling point for me.&nbsp; You get Batman, Robin, Batgirl and Alfred Pennyworth.&nbsp; You also get a Witch, two flying monkeys and the polkadot man.&nbsp; The latter 4 aren&#39;t exactly my favourite (but the inclusion of polka dot man makes it relatively unique), I am really happy for the first 4.&nbsp; The monkey head details are amazing and their legs are incredibly unique as well.&nbsp; The little bat boomerangs as well are pretty cool and we have yet to have a Witch in our collection.&nbsp; So despite not being my favourite, the set does come with a very good assortment.</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>What a fun set.&nbsp; Even though it is listed at 10-16, my 4 year old has had great fun playing with it. She would never be able to put it together (which is more relative to the rating) but she helped with all the mini figs, all the wheels and helped a couple of other items as well.&nbsp; As far as playability, this one is pretty fun with how it disconnects and puts back together with the four different vehicles.&nbsp; I would have to say this was one of my favourite builds to date!</p>

"Mystical_Narwhal","2018-01-18T03:06:24.443Z","Happily Surprised","<p>When I first saw this set I though &quot;Wow,&nbsp;<em>another</em>&nbsp;batmobile Lego set, I wish the figures were separate though&quot;. After receiving this as a birthday gift and putting it together I was amazed by how great of a set it is, so many play features, great figures, and much bigger than I thought it would be. The final look of the set, both together and apart (the four split vehicles) is perfect, and really has that great Batman-like vibe to it, definitely one of the many great Lego Batman Movie sets.</p>

"TimTam22","2017-11-20T11:05:24.467Z","This set is AMAZING!","<p>When I told my friends that I had purchased a massive LEGO Batmobile for $200, they all thought I was crazy. (Actually, they think I&#39;m crazy every time I say&nbsp;<em>anything</em>, but this time more than usual.) I have only built it once since I got it, but it is undoubtedly my absolute favorite set! The flying monkeys are amazingly detailed figures, and Polka-dot Man and Batsuit Alfred are both hilarious and unique minifigures. The key feature of this vehicle is not the minifigures&nbsp;or the bat-signal, but the vehicle&#39;s ability to split into 4 different vehicles - The (not ultimate) Batmobile, the Bat-Tank, the Bat-Bike, and the Batwing.</p>

<p>When building it, I was having lots of fun trying to figure out how the different components fitted together to create one massive Batmobile, but I was slightly annoyed that on each instruction, the newly added pieces were outlined in an irritating shade of thick yellow.</p>

<p>The set features many pieces that I have not seen anywhere else, mostly minifig&nbsp;pieces, but there were still some special other pieces. It is very playable, the separating vehicles allowing for some interesting (if not repetitive) stories with my little brother, my favorite of which involved varied bad guys stealing the Batmobile&nbsp;parts. However, my OCD was kicking in when trying to sit Batgirl&nbsp;in the Batwing. There are no studs to stick her to inside the cockpit, so she sits loosely and out-of centre, and her cape often hangs out the gap between the windshield and the wall. Also, the Bat-signal was a bit shoddy. The light was very weak, so you had to hold it close to the wall to even see the symbol. The sides of the symbol were also cut off at the sides, giving it quite an uncompleted feel. Finally, due to having many stud cannons, there are about 10 spare silver studs, which I think I&#39;ve lost already.</p>

<p>I hate giving sets many 5-star ratings, but this set certainly deserved it. Apart from a few pet peeves towards the spare pieces and light brick, it was an absolutely amazing set, possibly the best set I have ever bought. I totally recommend it for anybody who wants a fun build with fun minifigures.</p>

Good minifigures.&nbsp; One&nbsp; to forget&nbsp;</p>

"Kaisermighe","2018-09-07T15:52:34.377Z","Best Batmobile ever!!","<p>This set is amazing to say the least. To me, it&#39;s probably the best set of the Lego Batman movie wave.</p>

<p>The minifigures are great. You get all the movie-version&nbsp;bat-family (this Bat-Alfred is exclusive), plus four villains. The flying monkeys from &quot;the Wizard of Oz&quot; are stunning, also Polka-dot man is amazing!!&nbsp;Only drawback here to me is that being a big set, with all the pieces and minifigs involved, i would have imagined at least one of the main villains (three out of four are not even Batman gallery villains...)&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The vehicle looks perfect. The system to which it separates to form 4 different vehicles works very nicely, and all of them are very good. The batmobile itself is huge! It carries four stud-shooters and has room for 1 seated driver. Unfortunately removing the motorcycle means creating a big gap in the back. The motorcycle looks nice, no firing weapons but you can turn the wheels to become something of a flying bike, which is interesting. The bat-tank is heavy, there&#39;s room for the standing driver and inside for some weapon storage. It fires 12 (!) stud-shooters, making it really heavy equipped. And finally the batwing, probably my favourite of them all, it has room for 1 seated pilot and there&#39;s two spring-loaded orange&nbsp;shooters. But of this last one, the design is very striking and elegant. Of course to build this huge complete beast of 4&nbsp;vehicles in one, there&#39;s a huge number of stickers involved.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a big bat-signal complete with light brick, very cool!.</p>

<p>For this price per piece&nbsp;ratio (even less on amazon, as i&#39;ve&nbsp;done) i say it&#39;s the perfect deal of the line. As i&#39;ve&nbsp;said before&nbsp;there are some minor flaws, but it&#39;s nothing compared to the beauty of the design, the fun to play, and the good-working functions,&nbsp;overall the sheer amount of things you get for so little money is astounding.</p>
