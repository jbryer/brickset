"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-10T15:49:10Z","Raptors have never been...well... so non-moveable.","This set was sorta ho-hum in my mind.  I found it for a really nice price, but I do think that the original price is a little too hefty.  The dinosaurs make interesting additions, but I actually think they're pretty lacking.  The building was odd; I don't really know what the function of it would be...  But hey, there are some good things about the set too -- the minifigs are nice, and there are some nice pieces (the plants, the wings of the pterosaur, etc...).  Overall, a little pricey, but a few nice pieces.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

I mean, what is a glass building doing in the middle of a &quot;jungle&quot;? The dinosaurs and minifigs are great though. Against what I rated it, this set comes with loads of great pieces. So, I'll recommend it if you are in need of cool pieces. 6 out of 10.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

I like the building because it reminds me of that building in the first Jurassic Park film. You get 2 raptors, Johnny Thinder, Pippen, and also a cameraman. This set is really cool and good with Adventurers sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-07-30T10:47:00.89Z","Too Little for a Too Big Price","My mom bought me this set thinking I would like it. Being a gullible kid back then, I loved everything. Come to think of it now, by far sense it's not very worth it. There are too little pieces for a price too big. I wish they would place the raptors with the dino like in the Steven Spielberg Lego Studios set. This one looks too blocky. At least I have more parts to spare.. just the glass top, glass doors and the Studios outfit. The Verdict: Don't buy it unless you really have nothing else to buy.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"BaneShake","2009-05-26T10:51:07.903Z","Raptor Rumble Review","   When I was younger, I obsessed over anything dinosaur. As you can probably guess, I absolutely loved it. Although it doesn't have the same overwhelming appeal, it still is a very good set. Here are some pros and cons.
   The good: looks just like an old abandoned building overrun by jungle weeds.
                  the dinos are very detailed and can move somewhat
                  there is enough room inside the building to place the hero and heroine
                  the minifigs look just like they're ready for an adventure
                  the camera is a great piece to own. 
   The bad: the dinos can't move their legs/wings
                the raptors look too box-like and bulky
                the type of door in the set pop out of place too easily

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T13:09:00.707Z","Something Survived","<p>Welcome, to Jurassic Park, ladies and gentlemen this is my review for set #1370 Raptor Rumble of the Studios theme. A cross promotional item this combines LEGO Studios with Steven Spielbergs blockbuster franchise Jurassic Park.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set involves the filming of a scene from JP III where the Raptors are attacking Grant and his female companion and the Pteranodon is also on the prowl. (As is typical with LEGO this scene wasn't actually in the movie, but takes creative license to capture the spirit of the film if not the exact intent.) I find this set to be very good for it's value.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First you build the dinosaurs, two velociraptors and one pteranodon. The raptors aren't the most accurate and they have kid-friendly smiling faces, but they still do a passable job of representing the species they are meant to in LEGO form. The Pteranodon is blocky (well he is built out of bricks and plates) and also smiling. The parts are the same as the Baby Dinosaurs sets from the Dinosaurs theme, but they aren't that bad. I mean they could be a lot worse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish LEGO would revisit this theme with all the new engineering styles, we've had Star Wars, Batman, Harry Potter and Indy, not to mention Speed Racer, SpongeBob and Avatar the Last Airbender, I think a Jurassic Park LEGO theme might be pretty cool. Children do love dinosaurs after all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 'set' that the action takes place around is intended to represent the complex they discover during the film. This 'set' is pretty open it isn't so much of a building as more of a facade minus the cardboard scenery for the background. So I have to say as a building facade it actually looks pretty decent. I think it could even be built up more with any spare bricks lying around if you wanted to turn it into something more. But as&nbsp;a backlot facade it fits in nicely with any Hollywood Studio section of your LEGO City display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mini-figures are nice too, there's Johnny Thunder as Doctor Grant, a Cameraman with portable (Shaky Cam) camera and a female actress representing Tea Leoni's character. (She never wore a cap in the film though LEGO.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I rate this set a 5 overall because I just love Jurassic Park and Dinosaurs and wish LEGO would come up with a new Jurassic Park sub-theme in honor of the film's anniversary... Or whenever the next anniversary year will actually be for the film.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-11T12:20:43.78Z","LEGO Studios (Jurassic Park III) - Raptor Rumble Review","This set is my only set of the two LEGO Studios (Jurassic Park III) sets which I got. For some reason we get another Johnny Thunder minifig in this set. He may be a popular character but he's in too many sets. We also get a Miss Pippin Read minifig. This time she got a white cap. This set also has a cameraman who's filming this scene. I haven't watched the <span style=""font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"">Jurassic Park</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;""> </span></span></span></span>movies but I don't think that Johnny Thunder and Miss Pippin Read had been in there. We also get two black raptors. The black heads are from the LEGO Dinosaurs theme and the black arms and the black tail are movable. We also get a dark gray flying dinosaur (I forgot the real name...). All of these dinosaurs look very cool but I think they should have got more play features.<br><br>We also get a building which the dinosaurs are going to attack. There're two windows which sviwel full 360Â°. We have 4 leaves and a translucent dark gray dome on the top of that building. I think it's a cool set but I think that this model should have included some characters of the movie Jurassic Park III.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"BrickBrewer","2019-02-15T01:11:31.023Z","Nostalgia ","<p>This happened to be the very first set I ever had. Although none of the characters in the set are from the movie, I still love this set. This was a time in LEGO&#39;s history where using a likeness from a movie would have been an oddity reserved for the star wars theme. However, looking back, I am a little disappointed in the parts and build for the Pterodactyl and raptors. Compared to the dinos of Dino Island, they look even clunkier. Overall, despite its flaws, this set holds a special place in my collection.</p>
