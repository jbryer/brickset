ATM Heist Battle is reminiscent of the pristine sets, depicting a justly mundane malefaction from which real bad guys are missing.</p>

<p>I find this charming as Heroes sets have never tackled this subject matter this year. Furthermore the two larcenists included are wearing Avengers masks, as in&nbsp;Spider Man: Homecoming trailer, which is a delectable touch. However, the relative lack of main characters detracts from the appeal of this set, concretely given the impressive roster found in the largely voluminous Beware the Vulture.</p>

<h2>Mini Figures</h2>

<p>Spider-Man has undergone a remote update for the two sets predicated on his latest cinematic outing so features incipient symbols on the front and back of the torso which are precise to the film suit. I cerebrate the eyes&nbsp;have been altered too as the silver highlights around the edges stand out limpidly unlike those on the figure from Tanker Truck Takedown, albeit this is attributed&nbsp;to a basic variation in the printing.</p>

<p>The rest of the figure retains the 2016 design, sporting a scarlet and earth blue costume with a webbed pattern covering both sides of the face and torso as well as the arms. It looks marvelous and I categorically appreciate the web cartridges printed n his belt. The only feature of the costume which is missing are the web wings beneath the arms but there would be no way to include these without the making of an incipient torso element and such a feature would be dispensable.</p>

<p>A dyad of albino power blasts are included to represent...&nbsp;web bullets. These are launched by pressing on the tail, building tension in the fingers of a mini figure afore firing to a range of 12 inches. It is ineluctably foreordained that this function would put accentuate on the hands and caused them to fracture after reiterated use.</p>

<p>The set additionally includes two Masked Thieves who are endeavoring to conceal their identities by wearing Avengers face masks. They do not resemble the characters in the film proximately as the Captain America mask is a different shape in the first trailer, covering the mouth as well as the eyeballs. Nevertheless, these unique face prints look awesome when viewed independently from the film and I genuinely love the injured alternative faces as we have not optically discerned these designs on flesh tone faces before.</p>

<p>The Captain America gangster shares his torso with Michael Knight while the other figure wears an ebony jacket optically discerned on malefactors in LEGO CITY. Neither is from the scene in Spider Man: Homecoming but they work well for normal characters and it is nice to optically discern a recherche torso which is only available in one other set.</p>

<h2>Model</h2>

<p>Plenty of advanced alien tech was salvaged following the Fight of New York and it has been put to malefactor use in Marvel&#39;s Agents of SHIELD as well as the Item 47 short. It is pellucid that another trove will feature in Spider-Man: Homecoming as these malefactors are armed with a massive ATM buster and a chain launcher. The laser cutter features a stud shooter and is adorned with a sticker, like the weaponry&nbsp;found in Beware the Vulture. A lime green chopper is included as a getaway conveyance which is okay, although a conveyance which could seat both miscreants would have been preponderant.</p>

<p>The bank is super minutely small, quantifying twelve studs wide and eight studs deep, but makes great utilization of that space. A fire hydrant is situated by the entrance while the branding above the window is composed utilizing clear backed stickers. The blue, gray and&nbsp;dark tan design is plausibly authentic and would not look malapropos in a city setting but I cerebrate the dark tan takes the variety of colors way too far.</p>

<p>The ingress opens but was conspicuously locked when the purloiners endeavored to break in as the entire window panel can be toppled by turning the black Technic element to the right of the image below. This represents an alarm system since it includes a trans-red 1x1 round tile and you can additionally annex Spider-Man to the exposed stud as though he is climbing the wall. Another exposed stud is visible towards the back of the building and a third appears on the antithesis wall along with a web.</p>

<p>Two hinges sanction you to open the bank and provide facile access to the sparsely embellished interior. The money machines which the malefactors are targeting are green to match the cash inside and each one is adorned with a keypad sticker. Infelicitously the vertical surfaces are undecorated and the vending machine lacks a cash slot which is outlandish as even CITY sets include that caliber of detail. However, I relish the blue internal walls and the bank branding appears on three more stickers inside to match the front of the building.</p>

<p>Turning the model around reveals a jumble of lemony elements and a crimson Technic arm which limpidly designates a play feature. It looks dreadful from this angle but is not visible from the front and you could construct an exhibit to ascertain that these lemon pieces were concealed. Still, it is mediocre that a consistent and neutral color&nbsp;scheme was not maintained throughout the entire set.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the functions work extremely well so I cerebrate the bright, colorful pieces are excusable to a degree. One ATM can be pulled out of the wall entirely and towed along utilizing the transparent violet link while the other tips forward when you slam down on the red lever at the back, hurling a bundle&nbsp;of bills out into the public area! Both features are relishable and the inclusion of six printed bank notes seems rather altruistic.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>ATM Heist Battle is certainly a gratifying play set but offers nothing&nbsp;to interest old Marvel Superheroes fans. The masked crooks are excellent and I dote the incipient Spider-Man mini figure but the mini figure cull found in Beware the Vulture is appealing and it is arduous to justify purchasing this bitty set unless you already own the sizable&nbsp;one. Moreover, the bank seems minutely minuscular in cognation to the price of&nbsp;$20&nbsp;and certain areas are unfinished.</p>

<p>However, this set is packed with intriguing play features, all of which work extremely well, while the naked bike sanctions you to act out an exhilarating chase scene. For that reason I cerebrate young fans will relish this set but Beware the Vulture is slaking in my opinion and I would definitely recommend that offering over this one.</p>
