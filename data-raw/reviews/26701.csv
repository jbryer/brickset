<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (At the time of writing this review Spiderman Homecoming has NOT been released)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My first impressions of this was that it was under-whelming&nbsp;for the price point of $39.99 USD. Comparing this to other sets at a similar price point it felt small. However I really couldn&#39;t stay away from the minifigures in this set. There were also a variety of newer parts in this set that I wanted to have so I went and picked this up. It&#39;s time to see if I got my money&#39;s worth...&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>This uses the square box and of course features Spiderman in the top right hand corner. I can&nbsp;tell that&nbsp;the content&#39;s size was scaled up on the box which makes the set seem much bigger that it actually is.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>This set is dividing up into three bags&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bag 1: Spiderman, Vulture, Vulture&#39;s Wings</p>

<p>Bag 2: Shocker, Begins the Van</p>

<p>Bag 3: Iron Man, Completes the Van</p>

<p>Overall it wasn&#39;t a difficult build, but it was also fun to build. This uses a few interesting techniques to achieve&nbsp;certain angles on the van, but once again, not difficult. It did take much longer that I thought and it defiantly&nbsp;felt like over 375 pieces.</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>A variety of new/rare pieces are included&nbsp;in this set. I listed a few of the most notable&nbsp;down below.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6119107/plate-1x3"">6119107</a>&nbsp;in Medium Azure</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6167472/flat-tile-2x4"">6167472</a>&nbsp;in Purple</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6170504/brick-2x4x1-w-screen-no-2"">6170504</a>&nbsp;in White</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6192275/mini-shooter-w-3-2-shaft-no-1"">6192275</a>&nbsp;in White</li>
	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6138695/flat-tile2x3-w-angle"">6138695</a>&nbsp;in Light Bluish Grey</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Spiderman is updated slightly from his Civil War outing with a new torso print which improves the logo on the back and slightly changes the arm printing. It&#39;s not to big of a deal considering the head and legs are identical, but it&#39;s always nice to see LEGO putting forth their best effort to make these figures as accurate as possible.</p>

<p>Iron Man sports the new Mark XLVII&nbsp;(47) suit. It&#39;s defiantly&nbsp;reminiscent of the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/5002946-1/Silver-Centurion"">Silver Centurion</a>&nbsp;suit from last year. I really like the silver, more exposed section and it stands out from other Iron Man suits that feature the traditional red and gold color scheme. He has a trans-blue clear head underneath the helmet though which makes you ask is Tony Stark going to be flying this suit or will he be controlling&nbsp;remotely?</p>

<p>Shocker is by far my least favorite character in this set. He doesn&#39;t include any leg printing and his face is as far as I&#39;m concerned very generic. Also in most of the released footage the shocker wears a face mask similar to Spiderman and it&#39;s a shame it isn&#39;t included in this set. The gloves are also comically over-sized and I think they should have given him metallic hands and printed on the arms to achieve a better look. Speaking of which the torso printing does look nice and I&#39;m glad it extends to the arms.</p>

<p>Vulture it much better that he did in last years&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76059-1/Spider-Man-Doc-Ock-s-Tentacle-Trap"">Doc Ock&#39;s Tentacle Trap</a>. I really like the helmet print and I hate to be nitpicky&nbsp;but I wish they had included a hair-piece for him as well. Even thought the head is reused I actually think it does look good for Michael Keaton (minus the white eyebrows, he isn&#39;t that old).&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Completed Set</b></p>

<p>The Vulture uses a large pair of built up wings which looks much better than just using the pre-existing mold such as they did previously. I really like the look of the Nexo Knights shield piece and I hope they continue to use that piece to achieve&nbsp;similar looks in the future. I would have liked to have seen some turbine detail, but none the less it isn&#39;t a big deal. There are also a pair of Stud-Shooters with trans-purple studs to give the Vulture something to shoot with. These can also be removed and held in the hand of a minifigure.</p>

<p>The main build is the Shocker&#39;s&nbsp;Van. It uses a lot of stickers (many of which I chose not to apply). It looks good on the outside and uses a lot of&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6047220/plate-w-bow-2x2x2-3"">2x2x2/3 Bow Plate</a>s which give it a distinct look. You can unfortunately only fit a singular minifigure in the cab, which is a shame as it would have been nice to perhaps fit Vulture in also. The back is mainly taken up by the large 6-Stud-Shooter. This action reminds me of the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/5972-1/Container-Heist"">Container Heist</a>&nbsp;from 2009. You can also fit two supply boxes in the back. Inside the boxes is a small build for a &quot;Tech Egg&quot; and extra shots for the Stud-Shooter. The ramp in the back can be removed and replaced by a web piece to represent Spiderman stopping the vehicle. Inside there are also two clips which contain parts to build a rifle. It&#39;s the same build used by Kraven the Hunter from last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also include are a variety of web pieces for Spiderman to use, including three of the new Power Blasts in white.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>I really&nbsp;like&nbsp;this set. I was worried that I wasn&#39;t going to get the value out of this set that I desired, but I was surprised at how much better this set is in person. Of course the minifigures are amazing and there is a lot of playability for younger kids. If Spiderman Homecoming is a good movie I can see this being a hugely popular set. I would highly recommend this set for kids and adults.</p>

"dRevan","2017-12-14T16:15:42.08Z","Spiderman Homecoming: Beware the Vulture","<p>Beware the Vulture is the second set in the Spiderman Homecoming 2017 sets line. It contains 4 minifigures, 2 builds, contains 375 pieces and retails for $49.99 CAD.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong>:<br />
1. Spiderman: This variant is exclusive to the Homecoming sets line. It shares similarities with last years Tanker Truck Takedown Spiderman to the extent that the head and legs are exactly the same. The head features sleeker eyes with silver lining. The torso has a black spider and is lined with web shooter fluids on the sides. The arms contain printing as well. The legs are dual molded and contain some subtle black printing. Overall the figure is the best version of Spiderman yet. He comes with 2 white power blasts, new piece as of 2017, a web piece and a white rope.</p>

<p>2. Iron Man: This set comes with the exclusive Mark 47 armour. It features shiny, chrome silver printing over the dark red body. The legs have the chrome printing but would have benefitted from dual molding. Surprisingly, under the helmet is a trans-blue minifigure head with no printing rather than the Tony Stark head.</p>

<p>3. The Vulture: The Vulture comes resuses the classic Iron Man helmet in dark green with exceptional printing. The eyes are done in bright green and the helmet has the breathing apparatus printing. The face underneath is the same one that was used for the 2016&#39;s Vulture which features a stern face with some liver spots printing. The torso features a black coat with fur lining. At the back of the torso is the clear neck bracket used to mount to the glider.</p>

<p>4. Shocker: Shocker is the most simplest figure out of all the four figs. The head is a reuse from the 2016 First Order Battlepack&#39;s Officer. The torso is printed with a hoodie design with yellow arms containing criss-cross printing. The arms look cool and the torso overall is splendid. Shocker comes with 2 silver fists first introduced with the Legends of Chima line.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong>:<br />
Glider: The Vulture&#39;s Glider is a very organic structure and Lego designer has captured the shapes to a certain degree. The build is very geometric and symmetrical. There is a spot to attach the Vulture via the backpack piece. On either side are 4 of the pentagonal plates attached to create a cool design. On either ends are 4 feathers represented through 1x tiles in dark green. Each feather can be altered to create a flying look. Equipped on the Glider are two stud shooters which can be detached for further play<br />
Rotating the Glider around reveals two sticker to provide some further detailing. There are also 2 fans which are attached via the small Mixels joints so they can be posed in different ways. The fans lack the spinning turbine but are good nonetheless.</p>

<p>Van: The white van is a 8 studs wide design which is representing a modern GMC van. The design is accurate is a bit bland. The front has a simple design with 2 lights and a grille. There are a lot of stickers that are supposed to be applied which is Lego&#39;s way of covering up for the blandness. IMO the design is generic enough to be used for many different purposes. The hood has a sticker showing damage. The side mirrors are attached through a cool technique. The inside is very simple with just a steering wheel.&nbsp;<br />
The back is where it gets interesting. A lot of the curved 2x2 slopes are used to provide a curved frame. The side panels open up to reveal a gigantic 6-stud shooter. The inside also contains two crates with DODC-stickered lids. One of the crates contains an techno egg. Otherwise the inside is tiled with 2x2 tan plates. The back is build using a 6x4 plate with hinges and has a very nice 2x4 sticker. The back looks unfinished with the exposed colours clearly visible. On either side of the panels on the inside is a clip to attack two parts of a weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict:</strong><br />
This is set is good for getting all the main characters. The builds are okay especially the glider but the van is disappointing. The blandness is okay but the excessive amount of stickers is frustrating especially on pieces like the windscreen. The opening feature is okay. Overall the price IMHO is a bit too much. Instead of $50 CAD, it should have been $45. I bought it at a 20% sale which is what I would recommend you do too,<br />
Thanks for reading my review!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-23T11:29:51.897Z","The Vulture Strikes!","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #76083 Beware the Vulture:</b> Spider-Man Homecoming features two sets and of the two this set features all of the primary characters from the film, the hero and the two Super Villains. It&rsquo;s a fairly nice looking set with a very coherent looking pair of models and some fun new Minifigures for your Marvel Cinematic Universe collection.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: The box is pretty much what you&rsquo;ve seen before with Marvel Super Heroes. Something I may have neglected to mention in other reviews is that LEGO has coined a catch phrase. Build Something Super has been added and usually shows the main Super Hero from the Sub-Theme your set will come from. In this case LEGO Spider-Man is shown in animated form, and by animated I mean comic book art, not CGI. Anyway the box does a good job showing the set in action and all the fun features&hellip; Also Comic Book is Included.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: There are two numbered manuals in this set splitting up the build steps between the two models found in the set. You&rsquo;ll also find the same comic here that you get in the Thor Ragnarock based sets. The comics were printed one opposite the other to save on paper space I&rsquo;d wager.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Last, but certainly not least, is the sticker sheet for detailing. All of them are unprotected and could be creased or mangled depending on how they were put into the box by the packing machine.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A large number of elements is included in this set, you&rsquo;ll find a fair number of common parts and some nice plain unadorned Nexo Shield parts in grey There is also one purple 2x4 tile, just in case you&rsquo;re looking for a 2x4 purple tile for MOC builds.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Iron-Man: By now Iron Man has a lot of armors in LEGO form. This version is from Homecoming, otherwise known as the Mark 47. It&rsquo;s very detailed as is standard for the character, but there&rsquo;s one key difference for this character, nobody is piloting it. Well actually I suppose Friday might be behind the controls, a clear Minifigure head is used under the helmet, and clear studs and tubes are used to simulate arc reactor energy for piloting/maneuvering plasma blasts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Spider-Man: We&rsquo;ve seen Spider-Man a lot in past sets, this is of course the Homecoming costume and the print represents this quite nicely. There&rsquo;s darker blues and sharper reds with dual-molded legs for his red boots on blue leggings, or whatever you&rsquo;d care to call it. The printing on the side of the arms is rather newish too and overall is a great additional detail.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">He comes loaded with play accessories, you have a long string with studs on both end and clip on points to grasp for web swinging action, three flick held energy bursts in solid white for web blasts, a printed cell phone tile piece to hold so he can keep in touch with his Guy in the Chair buddy and a large piece of LEGO spider web for&hellip; Honestly I&rsquo;m not quite sure. I mean it is shown to be attachable to the truck to replace the back ramp, but that just looks silly and I&rsquo;m not sure why LEGO decided to include this. Still it offers more play features.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Shocker: Representing the second character to call himself Shocker in the film, this Minifigure features arm printing, a dual-sided torso and plain legs. His face features some printing which I think was shared by one of the Finn Minifigures in LEGO Star Wars. To my eyes the expression is rather familiar, considering he&rsquo;s only single-sided though it may be unique to him. He also uses the large fist accessories introduced with the Gorilla Tribe from Chima for his shock gauntlets, these don&rsquo;t quite match up with what is actually shown on screen, however LEGO is rather averse to casting new pieces for something like this when a perfectly serviceable element will be found already in the catalogue.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Vulture: The torso print on Vulture is exquisite, I love how they captured the flight jacket worn by Keaton in the film. The facial print leaves much to be desired however, it has dual-sided printing, though not dual-sided facial expressions, the back of the head is printed with liver spots. As is some of the front, this facial detailing is accurate to the comic version of Adrian Toomes, but I&rsquo;m not so sure Keaton has liver spots on his character.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Also of note is the lack of a proper hair piece element, so he&rsquo;s constantly wearing the single piece Iron Man helmet in dark green with scary night-googles and breathing mask printed detailing. No accessories.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Spidey and The Vulture engage in a powerful battle as you construct the wing backpack for Vulture. This is a massive looking model and the build is highly impressive with a lot of clever use of parts and techniques to ensure there are no visible studs. Minor sticker placement on the back of the wing pack for additional tech detailing. The only thing missing from the build are the taloned mechanical feet seen in the film.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: As with most vehicles you typically build the chassis/framework first, so you&rsquo;ll be putting the license plate stickers on during this build. The Shocker can help you build or join Vulture in fighting Spidey. No real tricky or difficult steps during this build, just a lot of sticker placement.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: Iron Man leaps into action to lend assistance to Spider-Man. You&rsquo;ll be building the rest of the model for the truck in this set, which features the front cab section, the rear storage area and the wheels. So it&rsquo;s a pretty quick build, stickers are still being used for detailing. Other than that not much to really discuss, oh, right, there is a large stud launcher hidden inside the truck.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Vulture&rsquo;s Wings: Click hinges and ball joints allow for a wide range of motion with the wings, clips and bars also help angle the tips in dynamic poses. Two stud-shooters are found on the wing pack for offensive purposes&hellip; Due to the nature of LEGO these wings can&rsquo;t fold over the character and become a shield as they did in the movie, but no amount of jointing would allow for such a thing. It&rsquo;s a really well put together model though with some great techniques to hide all but a few of the studs seen on the donut plates used to simulate VTOL engines.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Stolen Truck: I say this is a stolen truck, but it&rsquo;s possible it is actually the arms dealing truck that Vulture and Shocker are using to transport their black market weaponry. Considering the model has an opening rear section with a flip up stud launcher I suspect that is actually the case. It&rsquo;s a solid vehicle build and looks great, the driver&rsquo;s section can actually accommodate Shocker while he&rsquo;s wearing his large glove accessories. Makes for an odd driver since I doubt he can steer very well wearing them, but at least you don&rsquo;t have to take them off when he&rsquo;s driving the getaway from the heroes.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">For 50$ Canadian this is a solid offering, you get two heroes and two villains from the film and a lot of fun models to play with loaded with personality and sticker detailing. There&rsquo;s also some of the new launch elements which can be held in a Minifigures hands to flick them at enemies, in this instance they are solid white to represent webbing. A great MCU inspired set for Sony&rsquo;s first Spider-Man solo film and a must have set. I strongly recommend trying to track one down now that it&rsquo;s retired.</p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2018-01-05T16:30:55.737Z","Sir, he's getting away. You handle the jeep, I'll handle the scary demon guy.","<p>Hello fellow Brickset readers. I admit I&#39;ve been pushing this review off since the holidays, but now it&#39;s time for me to review it.&nbsp; Let&#39;s dive into this set. For those who still have not seen the movie, there will be no spoilers in this review.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m no expert on box sizes, I admit, but I thought it looked pretty normal to me. The artwork was fabulous, as expected as always. For the most&nbsp;part, I found the instructions pretty easy to follow.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>There were some interesting parts in the set. First, there was two of those fist pieces (one was a spare), which I believe are not to common in silver. We also got a cell phone tile piece, which is also not too common. We also got a couple of the new power blast pieces, which only appeared in a couple different sets (mostly in the Superheroes line). We also got a new design for the web piece (it has a bar instead of two clips). There was also&nbsp;a bunch of trans - purple studs, which are probably one of the least common trans color studs. We also got a bunch of plain gray nexo - knights&nbsp;style shields, two black circle pieces with a hole in the middle, a clear bracket piece and the new iron man helmet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set includes four figures. Starting out with the least interesting is the Shocker. He really isn&#39;t a bad figure, but his head suffers the same fate as the Killmonger&nbsp;figure for 2018 in the Royal Talon fighter Attack, as the face clearly doesn&#39;t represent the actor. The most&nbsp;appealing&nbsp;part of the figure is the torso, which features a nice hoodie print and printed arms. The figure lacks leg printing. Next, we have Iron Man. To be honest, once you&#39;ve seen one, you&#39;ve kind of seen them all. In fact, this version is perhaps almost identical to the one in Civil War, with a silver section under the chest and on the legs. Unfortunately, this set does not come with the normal face and comes with a trans - blue face.&nbsp; Next we have the Vulture, which is an interesting figure. He looks kind of awkward without his jetpack on. However, ignoring this, he is a very nice figure. His helmet is a repurposed iron man helmet that does not open. He features the same head as the last set he was in, which surprisingly suits the actor well. He also has a nice torso, consisting of a black jacket with a fur collar. The legs are plain, but I&#39;m alright with that.Last, but not least, is Spiderman, himself. This version is not too different then that of the Civil War set, with the exception of some eye printing and an adjustment of the symbol. Nonetheless, it is still a great figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build was pretty easy, but be careful to look at the instructions carefully, especially on the&nbsp; sides of the car. Also, be careful to place the hatches of the van on correctly. This set also has a lot of stickers, so if you don&#39;t like stickers, I&#39;d ask for help on that.</p>

<p><b>Completed Model:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I like both of the completed models. The Vulture&#39;s jetpack&nbsp;looks really nice, if not a bit oversized, but I think it still looks good. The van looks very nice, with a bunch&nbsp;of dent marks and webs. The six - stud - shooter works well (though I personally don&#39;t like those because you lose so many studs). Personally, I think the van would work well in a city display if you don&#39;t include the stickers or&nbsp;the six -&nbsp;stud -&nbsp;shooter or the weapons. But overall, I think it looks good even with all those components.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would highly recommend this set. For the most part, the figures are very nice, there are a lot of good pieces, some good builds and a great building experience. This set has both good displayability and playability&nbsp;and I highly recommend it for both fans of Spiderman and for those who want a good set. I also recommend you see the movie as well.</p>

<p>See you soon in my next review.</p>
