"poffdr","2017-08-11T14:15:57.23Z","By the great bricks of Asgard!","<p>This set was truly a great deal of fun for me. From opening the bags to the shelf! The shuttle was a great build with the disc shape wings and the Hulk deployment&nbsp;bay!</p>

<p>The Pros for this set for me are the many different configurations for Hela&nbsp;such as&nbsp;the choices of&nbsp;height,&nbsp;wear the helmet or her hair, and&nbsp;her weapons or power blast! I also love the variety of parts in this set especially the shuttle wings and the Fenris&nbsp;wolf! Additionally, the Fenris&nbsp;wolf construction was a fun build as well!&nbsp;I also like that there is a good variety and quantity of mini figures.</p>

<p>The Cons for this set is that I don&#39;t like the way the Fenris wolf looks once together. Again, I loves the construction but not how it looked. Maybe a body piece over the back would help I am not sure. Scourge was not was in this set! I think by removing either one or both of the berserker&nbsp;figures and adding Scourge would have made this set even better!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all I love this set and would totally recommend it to any Marvel or outer space fan!</p>

"FowlerBricks","2018-03-12T21:56:58.8Z","Because That's What Heroes Do!","<p>I&#39;ve been impatiently waiting for &nbsp;Thor: Ragnarok and the Lego sets since the first trailer. Now that I have finally seen the movie and gotten one of the sets, I am geared up for a review! Let&#39;s dive in and see if this set is really worth fifty dollars or not. (MINOR SPOILER WARNING)</p>

<p><br />
THE BOX AND INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/xfepbncwz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p><br />
The box is fairly sizable and sports one of the earliest pictures of Thor and Hulk in their Ragnarok gear.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ijg6446o3/6.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>I have to say that it&#39;s not the best picture ever. Hulk looks a bit like a deranged chimp and Thor looks weirdly Asian (no offense to any Asian people, but Thor isn&#39;t supposed to look like that). Quite a few people have pointed out the fact that the ultimate battle for Asgard is taking place some fifteen miles outside of Asgard proper. However, &quot;Asgard is not a, it is a people&quot; (-Odin and Heimdall) so in light of that it makes a small amount of sense for them to fight outside the city. Placing the battle on the Bifrost would have made much more sense though. It also seems to be snowy in Asgard which is strange. You can see the Bifrost on the back of the box, but it leads to...an empty platform with two spires on it? Well, that&#39;s not quite right. Despite these odd art choices, the color scheme of the box and the background really makes the set pop. All the characters get named which is great plus we see that Thor has a very exciting power blast! Turning the box back over we find more eye catching shots of the set and that Hela has power blasts too.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/fclmkfos3/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Overall the box accomplishes &nbsp;it&#39;s goal: to draw your eye to the set. There are some flaws, but come on, it&#39;s a box. There are two instruction books in this set plus a mini comic book.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/5falrdwlv/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The comic is neat, featuring Spider-Man on one side and Thor on the other. The comic also comes in the Spider-Man: Homecoming sets. The instructions are standard fare.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/773kma88z/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/7juysg3df/image.jpg"" style=""height: 450px; width: 600px;"" /></p>

<p>THE PARTS</p>

<p><br />
So many different parts in so many different colors! Red, yellow, blue, dark green , black, grey and even a tiny bit of glow in the dark! Lots of interesting parts too. There is so many cool ones, I&#39;m not even going to try to list them all. Just looks up the parts list. A few notable pieces are: five light bluish-gray ingots, five black Plate 2X3, Rock, No. 1 which are exclusive in this color as of right now and four red Circle 90D 10X10, Wry 18D which appeared in only one other set! Good stuff here.</p>

<p>THE MINIFIGURES</p>

<p><br />
Hmm...how willl we do this? we have six minifigures to look at...well technically five since the Berserkers are identical. Why don&#39;t we start with them?</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/3nhmwg2yb/7.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>So based on the design and name of these characters, Lego or Marvel clearly pulled some inspiration from Lord of the Rings. That&#39;s not a bad thing though. It is rather confusing why these guys are included in the set at all. They never appear in the movie and only appear in one trailer being pulped by Heimdall. I guess these were prototype baddies that got scrapped somewhere in production and Lego already had the minifigures made. Despite the fact that they never appear in the movie, they are excellently designed and very accurate to the brief glimpse we get from the trailer. The printing could have been brighter though. It&#39;s hard to see the dark green since it&#39;s printed on black. As I mentioned before, both Berserkers are the same and have terrifyingly large mouths on an otherwise featureless face. Well, maybe featureless isn&#39;t the right word. There aren&#39;t any eyes or nose but the front and the back are printed with dark green rootlike designs.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/s3zsqylpf/9.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The weird green root/bone/armor things continue on the front and back of the torso as well. Both Berserkers are equipped with very nasty looking twin blades and some strange spike on their backs.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ox597abj7/8.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;All in all, these are superb and very massable characters. They&#39;re very accurate to the trailer too. It&#39;s just a shame that they didn&#39;t show up in the film itself. I almost like these guys better than the dead Asgard soldiers that Hela used. My only complaint is the dimness of the green detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Next up we have Valkyrie.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/k11mf9yfn/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/h4elfdapv/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>It&#39;s not very movie-accurate to have her in her Sakaarian outfit during the final battle with Hela, but I understand why Lego did it. Valkyrie wore the blue outfit longer than she did the white. Still, accuracy would have been nice. Valkyrie is by no means a bad minifigure though. She uses the same hair as the Orcs from 79016 Attack On Lake-Town and it suits quite well. It&#39;s a bit narrow, but there is no existing hairpiece that would work better. Her face is single-sided due to her hair, but Lego has done a good job making a suitably neutral expression for the one face. It also does a surprisingly good job of capturing the actress in minifigure form. A new cape is included for her, featuring a jagged, squared off design made to hang over one shoulder.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/n5cacgzwz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Valkyrie&#39;s torso has very crisp and clean except for right at the neckline. All the rest of the print is excellent, even the shiny silver bits, but the skintone above the neckline doesn&#39;t match the nougat color of her face and arms. It&#39;s the same problem Lego keeps running into: there&#39;s not enough paint applied to make it properly opaque. Valkyrie&#39;s legs are just plain dark blue and I think that&#39;s perfectly ok. She is armed with a gladius to represent the Dragonfang sword.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/kb94z02vn/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>An extra is also included and it&#39;s worth noting that these are made of a harder plastic than the ones in, say, the Hobbit sets. I think this change is a good one, since the handle won&#39;t flake as much as they used to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
Moving on we come to the long-awaited Bruce Banner minifigure! FINALLY!!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/t7jx34w4j/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Took you long enough Lego! It only took a Hulk movie, two Avengers movies and the third Thor movie for you guys to make one. Now, where&#39;s my Stan Lee minifigure? Anyway, let&#39;s take a look at Banner. His hair is a great choice and fairly accurate. His face is dual sided, featuring a vaguely amused expression that looks good but maybe doesn&#39;t quite capture the look of Mark Ruffalo. Turning the face around, there&#39;s a superb angry face that has green eyes, signaling that the Hulk is about to emerge!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/rr8eksyar/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Banner has to wear some of Tony Stark&#39;s clothes in Ragnarok and while the torso isn&#39;t entirely accurate, it&#39;s as close as Lego could get since his shirt in the film seemed to have a design that I&#39;m sure was licensed. I think they did an excellent job, but the skin above the neckline of the gray shirt isn&#39;t toned right. There&#39;s so little of it though, so I can ignore. The plain gray shirt looks fine too me and the black jacket has great detail front and back.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/lqapnqjeb/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Banner&#39;s legs are just normal black legs. Overall, I&#39;m very satisfied with this minifigure. Even more so since you could easily make a custom Tony Stark with the pieces from a second Banner fig. Banner&#39;s face is generic enough to be used elsewhere, as long as you don&#39;t turn it around. Well done Lego!&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Next up: the goddess of death herself, Hela and wow, there&#39;s a lot to look at here.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/3nhmwk5k3/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Hela gets two sets of accessories, two faces, a cape, a hairpiece and a huge scary helmet. Let&#39;s look at her head first. Her normal face is kind of smirking, like she knows all too well that no one can beat her. Her lips and around her eyes are green to match her torso and cape. Her alternate face is angry and has some weird shadowy mask. Freaky.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/64te3tx6b/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Her hair is nothing new, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that Lego had included hair at all. I was expecting to have to always use the helmet. The helmet isn&#39;t a bad piece though, quite the opposite. It&#39;s a perfectly made piece! It works with either face and is molded out of a rubbery plastic so you don&#39;t have to worry about snapping the massive hornlike spines jutting out the sides.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/4d0f8xlj7/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/grn799kr7/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>There&#39;s a tiny bit of dark green printing on the forehead. From the back, the helmet looks rather like a large upside down spider.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/w0d4n345v/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Hela&#39;s cape is the new soft kind recolored in dark green. The dark green recolor is exclusive to this set right now. &nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/773kme34z/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Her torso is similar to the Berserkers in that the dark green is very hard to see. There&#39;s some splashes of lighter green here too. Up in each corner there is a bit of her shoulder visible and again, it&#39;s more pale than typical Lego flesh tone. It works on Hela though, since her skin is fairly pale in the film, but Lego needs to pay more attention to this kind of thing. The bare shoulder printing continues around the back of her torso, as does the green detail.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/7wmcyptdv/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Hela comes equipped with a gunmetal gray broadsword and a gunmetal gray old style poleaxe. Neither of them pieces are exclusive but one can never nave too many broadswords and it&#39;s nice to see that Lego still uses the poleaxe piece. Both these weapons are very appropriate since Hela can produce just about any blade imaginable out of thin air.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/8m55b4bxv/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>She also has optional twin black power blasts which are exclusive to this set right now. A third is included as an extra. I suppose that these could represent the teeny daggers she was so fond of tossing around.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/jlqcmqhsj/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Whether that&#39;s what Lego intended or not, it&#39;s still nice to be able to get the power blast piece in black. It&#39;s&nbsp;odd that Lego showed the blasts as red in one of their pictures when red blasts don&#39;t even exist (well, they do exist but they&#39;re not available in any set right now).&nbsp;Hela&#39;s legs are plain black.</p>

<p><br />
Now last, but certainly not least: Thor, the god of thunder!...or...lightning...or both. Let&#39;s just go with both.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/d819jhsc3/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Anyway, I want to get my one major nitpick out of the wat first: Thor includes his helmet but no hair. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love this new helmet and I&#39;m happy to get it in this set even if it&#39;s not accurate to this scene. However, the lack of hair is a huge oversight. Lego was very thoughtful and included hair for Hela so why not Thor? The spikey hairpiece (part #6163633) would work or the original Star-Lord hair (part #6082516). Luckily I had one that I could steal from Star-Lord when he isn&#39;t using it, so I&#39;m good to go, but other people may not have one readily available.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/4prtf5tj7/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>While we&#39;re on the subject of the helmet, let&#39;s take a closer look at it.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ezu8ee3z7/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The piece is molded in gunmetal gray and has very intricate details that come solely from the molding itself. The wings on the side look excellent, but they cannot fold up and down like it could in the movie. I&#39;m okay with that though since the folding feature could have potentially compromised the sturdiness of the thing. The superb molding continues over the entire helmet...except for on the insides of the wings.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/gevt34zxf/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>I understand that it would have been difficult to achieve molding on the inside like that, but I still would have liked to see it. In the film, the helmet has some blue on it which is absent here, but I think it looks fine without it. Despite the lack molding on the inner parts of the wings, this is a top-notch piece that deserves a place of honor in your collection, probably on Thor&#39;s head since, you know, he has no hair. Thor&#39;s face has been redone for the two Ragnarok sets and it&#39;s by far the most interesting face yet. The first side shows a somewhat cocky smirk that looks very different when you put the helmet on.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/6uc6ga5gj/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Thor&#39;s beard is thinner here and slightly more scruffy, which I like very much. The second face is angry, but not just your typical angry face: Thor is ready to seriously kick some butt! Lightning is crackling out of his eyes, making them turn white from the energy while the lightning itself is a beautiful metallic blue.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ko0j5c5rn/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>I couldn&#39;t have asked for a better pair of faces! Well done Lego. Very well done! The box shows the white bit of the lightning as being light blue, but I can overlook that exaggeration. Thor&#39;s torso is a brand new design printed on gunmetal gray. The printing is of the highest quality: crisp, clean and has some real physical depth.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/40912uqfn/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/xfepbv2oz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>It seems to be decently accurate. Thor&#39;s trademark circle-things are present on this armor, but there&#39;s only four this time and their not as prominent as on his previous suits. In the film however, there were only two. He also has some type of strap crossing his chest. The excellent printing continues on is back, but the strap does not, which is a bit puzzling, since it did in the film. There&#39;s some armor printed on Thor&#39;s right arm (from the front) which makes him stand out from many of the superheroes minifigures, since the majority doesn&#39;t have arm printing.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/8m55b748z/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Thor comes with what I first though was a shoulder-cape like Valkyrie, but after watching the movie, I found that it &nbsp;was actually half of his usual cape. It&#39;s a really neat piece that works quite well and is currently exclusive to this set. The fabric is the new spongy kind, so you don&#39;t have to worry about it crinkling up.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/okdv1ctc3/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The instructions tell you to put the cape so it hangs over Thor&#39;s left arm (from the front) which is great but not entirely accurate. In the film it was very clearly on his right shoulder. The cape is designed so that you can hang it over either shoulder, however I prefer to take the less accurate route and keep it on his left shoulder. It covers the excellent arm printing when on the right side. Anyway, moving on to the legs. The legs are done in gunmetal gray, same as the torso. The printing lines up decently well with the print on the torso but the silver is noticeably darker and has an almost blurry quality, especially on the hips. It still looks good despite this and it&#39;s nice to finally get a Thor with leg printing. Overall I was very impressed with this figure despite the fact that he&#39;s not totally accurate and am happy to say that he makes it into my top 3 Marvel minifigures as #3 (Silver Centurion takes #1 and Civil War Spidey takes #2). Thor includes two power blasts plus one extra.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/4d0f91o4z/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><br />
THE BUILD<br />
My brother helped build this set, so it took us only about 15 minutes to complete. I was tasked with building the Fenris Wolf and since there is two instruction booklets we were able to build simultaneously. The wolf was a very build. Lots of SNOT plus some of the cool parts, like the glow-in-the-dark studs and the black Plate 2X3, Rock, No. 1 . The Commodore has some interesting building techniques as well. Definitely not a dull build!</p>

<p><br />
THE COMPLETED MODEL<br />
We&#39;ll start with the very smallest first: Hela&#39;s blade/stand thing. It&#39;s not much to look at but it does have a few neat pieces and it serves it&#39;s purpose.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/rr8ekzlhv/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/lg374078j/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>In the film Hela summons giant spikes out of the ground. This is supposed to represent either the tip of a very large spike or a small one. Hela can stand on top and tilt forward or backward depending on how you place her.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/vnlqgzlwz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Again, it&#39;s not much but it does add a little to the set plus it can make Hela a whole lot more intimidating than when she just is standing on the ground.</p>

<p>Next up we have the Fenris Wolf.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ady464xwj/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>This is actually not the first Fenris wolf that Lego has made. The first one was in #7015 Viking Warrior challenges the Fenris Wolf (yup. That&#39;s the name). This wolf is definitely an improve over the Vikings one, but I still have mixed feelings about it. It has great poseability, excellent parts and building it was fun but...the colors. There&#39;s too many colors. Black, dark buish gray, light bluish gray, brown, dark brown and tan. That really breaks up the shape of the wolf and makes it look unreal, like a statue come to life.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/jzroluwlv/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/kqkerneer/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>If it were mostly black with a few dark bluish gray spots that would be great. The wolf looks awesome as some sort of statue come to life, but it&#39;s very hard to see it as a real wolf. The shaping of the head is superb though and the mouth even opens! Unfortunately there are no teeth. I don&#39;t know how they could have added teeth at that size. The eyes glow-in-the-dark, which is a nice touch. The head&nbsp;has has decent side to side and downward movement but zero upward movement. There are a few studs on the wolf&#39;s back so Hela can ride him.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/arzg55x9f/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/bvjkh551v/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The legs and tail have tons of articulation and you can get the wolf into some pretty funny poses.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/y67fh3umb/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>If only the color was more cohesive. Then it would be perfect.</p>

<p>Finally we come to the Commodore itself.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/cjsf033rn/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>At first glance, the Commodore seems to rely solely on large quarter circle pieces. I was not a fan of it when images were first released. It looked odd and juniorized. However, now that I have it in person I can see that it is by no means a juniorized build. It&#39;s actually quite complex in some areas. There are ten stickers scattered over the ship to give it more detail. Some of them are rather large so be prepared. The cockpit can fit only one minifigure and whoever pilots has to lean waay back . Because the canopy is so large it doesn&#39;t look too bad to have them basically lying down.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/iyrfwrpwz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>A 1x2 slope with a sticker is used as the controls.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/n6m85ijmr/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>On either side of the cockpit are dual stud shooters. This isn&#39;t entirely accurate since the Commodore had no weapons and when Thor added one, he mounted it in the cargo bay area inside. The stud shooters look good though and they add play value too. Plus, if you really just don&#39;t like them, you can very easily remove them.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/fdvkdk8ir/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>One more important note about the cockpit: sometimes if you&#39;re not careful when loading a minifigure aboard, the lower part of the cockpit can pop off, so just be careful. Behind the cockpit you&#39;ll find a yellow 2x2 tile.</p>

<p>This is the trigger for a feature that we&#39;ll discuss in a minute, so remember it. Moving past the tile, there&#39;s a hinged spot that opens to allow access to the &#39;trunk&#39; where Valkyrie&#39;s sword can be stored.</p>

<p>The engines are made with a combination of trans-purple studs and a sticker.</p>

<p>Taking a jump forward we can see some SNOT building that gives a bit of curve to the inner part of the circle around the cockpit. Various other tiles and stickers help complete the bright and rather haphazard color scheme and decorations that is the trademark of Sakaar.</p>

<p>Flipping the ship over, we find that the bright colors are somewhat subdued because of some dark bluish gray plates. We also see that there are 17 2x2 light bluish gray slider pieces! 17! This is the set to buy if you need some of those.</p>

<p>Now we get to see what that yellow tile on top is for. Directly behind the cockpit (on the underside) are some blue pieces and studs that seem to be facing the wrong way. Place Bruce Banner on these studs, flip the ship upright and press the tile. When you do so, you&#39;ll get an excellent re-enactment of the scene where Banner makes a spectactular leap from the Commodore to save the Asgardians from the charging Fenris wolf, fails to turn into Hulk during the fall and lands flat on his face.</p>

<p>Overall, I think Lego did a superb capturing the Commodore at this size.</p>

I&#39;m pretty happy with this set. It has amazing minifigures, five of which are exclusive, a cool main build and decent side builds. However, $50 is a bit steep for only 400 parts, especially since a good bit of that is used for the Fenris wolf. The fact that it doesn&#39;t include Hul is another downer. Gladiator Hulk comes in the arena set, but we didn&#39;t get a normal Hulk (if you can ever call Hulk normal) from Ragnarok, which is disappointing. The Age Of Ultron Hulk can work, but the pants are wrong and it would have been nice to get a different expression too. While this is a great set, I feel that Lego missed some big opportunities with Ragnarok. They could have made the Commodore Quinjet size, they could have filled some of the major gaps in the Thor minifigure lineup with characters such as Heimdall, Korg and Odin, they could have made a buildable Giant-Man style Surtur and so much more. &quot;Sigh&quot;. At least they covered the basics.</p>

<p>PROS</p>

<p><br />
Superb Minifigures<br />
Lots of great parts<br />
Decently movie accurate<br />
Thor&#39;s helmet!<br />
New capes<br />
Bruce Banner, finally!</p>

<p><br />
CONS</p>

<p><br />
A bit pricey<br />
Wolf has too many colors<br />
No Hulk<br />
No hair for Thor</p>

<p><br />
This set is definitely the one to get if you only want to buy one of the Thor: Ragnarok sets (even if it doesn&#39;t have Hulk).<br />
