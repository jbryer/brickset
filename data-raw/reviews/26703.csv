<p><strong>Minifigures</strong>:<br />
1. Aquaman: The Jason Momoa Aquaman is a fanatastic figure to obtain. He has a new hairpiece which is very nicely textured and has white printing on the front. The face resembles Momoa and every detail is captured perfectly down to his eyebrows. One side has a stern expression but the other side has white pupils and a screaming or angry expression. The torso is gold coloured and has copper and reflective gold printing. It is also very intricately printed and has his trademark A belt. The legs are dark green and have some gold printing as well. Aquaman is armed with a trident in an exclusive p<br />
pearl dark grey colour.<br />
2. and 3. Atlantean Guards: The guards are IMO better than Aquaman. They have a new mold for their helmet which has scales molded on its side. The faces underneath are also a surprise: Anakin Skywalker and Legolas&#39;s faces. The torso detailing is similar to Aquaman&#39;s but has abs and armour detailing. The legs continue the armour detailing down to the toe. Each guard is armed with a harpoon gun in white with 2 cones attached to form a powerful gun.</p>

<p>4. Parademon: The parademon has the orangish yellow and dark blue colour scheme. The face has huge red eyes and an angry expression. The back of the head has blue flesh peeking through. The torso is printed in orangish yellow but has light yellow detailing. Its chest is exposed revealing his ribs which is done in blue as well. The legs are dark blue and have more flesh exposed as well. The demon comes with 2 sets of wings similar to Hawkman from 2015. Its armed with a simple black stud shooter.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong>:<br />
The build consists of possibly an entrance to Atlantis. There is a central entrance flanked by two arches and two pillars on either side which are stickered. On top of the arch are two of the Nexo Knights pointed pieces forming a triangular dome. The pieces are in an exclusive trans-light blue and dark pearl grey colours. Behind the dome is an area to store the Motherbox.&nbsp;<br />
On either side of the arch are two smaller pillars which can be knocked over. There are also spots to place the guards on either of the smaller pillars. A few stickers are used to provide some additional details on the pillars. Green algae pieces are used to give an underwater effect. Peppered through the builds are 1x1 glow-in-the-dark studs.&nbsp;<br />
Additionally, a very small base is created out of sand green parts to hold the Motherbox. The build for the box is simple but has a 2x2 exclusive printed tile.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong>:<br />
The set is perfect for the minifigures but the build is very lacking. Perhaps another copy of the set could complete the build. 3 exclusive figures for a $25 set is not bad. I enjoy the new Aquman and am glad that he made an appearance in an inexpensive set. The set is not without flaws but is inarguably the best out of the three sets for its price and figures.</p>

"YellowHouse","2018-01-31T21:07:39.403Z","Cool Minifigs","<p>I bought this set for the new Jason Momoa&nbsp;Aquaman minifig, as I&#39;m sure everyone else did. I was not willing to pay $20 for the set so I waited and paid $15.80 excluding tax.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am very pleased with the Aquaman&nbsp;minifig&nbsp;and the 2 Atlantean guards. Not so much with the Parademon but my son likes him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build was lacking but I can&#39;t complain much for getting 4 minifigs&nbsp;in a $20 set. I wasn&#39;t expecting a great build but the set does include some&nbsp;great pieces. This is also what led me to pull the trigger and buy it. I am a fan of the sand green color, especially the masonry bricks and I really like that this set comes with 2 sand green arches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another thing worth mentioning is that all the white-ish studs&nbsp;glow in the dark. I didn&#39;t have any of these&nbsp;pieces prior to purchasing this set and I think it&#39;s good play feature for the kids.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I think the set is average. If you want it for the minifigs&nbsp;I&#39;d try to find it on sale. I definitely think it&#39;s worth $16 for the figs and pieces. I really like the new Aquaman&nbsp;and the guards would be great for building an army.&nbsp;</p>

This was the cheapest offering from the theme which featured Movie Aquaman and one of the three Mother Boxes for 24.99$. Is the set worth picking up? Hopefully this review will help to answer that question.</span></span></span></span></p>

Other than that the rest of the box is typical of DC Super Heroes with the nice blue colouring for DC&rsquo;s logo and all of the great action shots you like to see when determining if the set is worth the asking price.</span></span></span></span></p>

Their serviceable, considering the build is broken up into two numbered bags it makes a minor bit of sense that the manual would be so thick, I suppose, though it does seem to come in the box bent in half, which is something I&rsquo;m not used to when dealing with manuals of this thickness. Also makes it harder to keep the manual open while building.</span></span></span></span></p>

That is a real draw for this set for MOC fans looking for some useful parts, as a bonus the detailing is mostly stickers, so you can avoid printed elements for your MOCs if you want to buy a few or Bricklink the parts from the set for your personal creations. You&rsquo;ll also find one of those stupid super jumpers in the set&hellip; I had hoped LEGO would abandon these things considering all of the bad press they&rsquo;ve gotten, but it was not to be.</span></span></span></span></p>

He has a double-sided facial print with a serious expression and then a massive angry &lsquo;power&rsquo; using expression.</span></span></span></span></p>

However what is really awesome is the brand new play element, the power launcher. I feel that it&rsquo;s been used in some Marvel sets perhaps first, but this new element resembles an energy blast, press it and it will flick off against an enemy. It flies pretty far too, so it&rsquo;s easy to lose, which is why they include two here.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Atlantean Guard: There are two of these guys in this set, both wearing very detailed golden armor with a lot of leg printing and dual-sided torsos. They also feature dual-sided faces so one can have a unique expression to the other. Their accessories are the LEGO spear gun piece with some other built on elements to make a more futuristic looking spear gun weapon, honestly not much to look at as far as accessories go. Generic troop builder forces here with this character, which isn&rsquo;t bad.</span></span></span></span></p>

Very suitably menacing looking, he includes two different wing pieces as well, one for at flight and the other more for when he&rsquo;s on the ground. It&rsquo;d be nice if they included two Parademons in the set honestly, but for what we got it&rsquo;s a very nice looking Minifigure.</span></span></span></span></p>

Stickers are applied on certain areas, younger fans may want some help to make sure the stickers are applied evenly and look smooth and without fingerprint marks.</span></span></span></span></p>

Which is why, while the model itself is pretty ho-hum and only really good as a display piece, since there are very limited play features (you basically use the super jumper to hit a weak section of the model and knock the mother box down so the Parademon can steal it.), so I find that the model is just there honestly.</span></span></span></span></p>

"LegoBatmanLandon","2018-04-19T23:41:39.83Z","Atlantis in a new light","<p>this set looks great for display and a is a great play set.</p>

<p>the build: the build consists of a lot of sand green bricks which are both a rare color for pieces, but also&nbsp;look very cool. the structure is a gateway that is covered in vines and some glow in the dark 1x1 studs. there is also a rock in the middle with this white box with a printed 2x2 tile. there are these podiums on the side on 2x2 jumper plate that have an exploding feature. the best feature is when the white box in the top and knock down the wind shield. trust me, this is an awesome feature.</p>

<p>the minifigures: the 2 nearly identical Atlantis&nbsp;guards have nice armor and helmets&nbsp;that are exclusive to this set. the difference between the figures is that one has Legolas&#39; head and the other has Anakin&#39;s&nbsp;head. the Aquaman has a great outfit&nbsp;and a new head and sick hairpiece. the Parademon is not exclusive, but this is the cheapest set you could could get&nbsp;him in.&nbsp;</p>

"Anorak719","2018-10-08T00:54:17.517Z","Good for parts and figures","<p>The set, as a whole, is not incredibly impressive. However, the parts are great, and are relatively rare, but the clear standout are the figures.</p>

<p>Aquaman is new, and also has a new hairpiece. the molding is great, and while the torso looks similar to the soldiers&#39;, it isn&#39;t exactly the same. The likeness to Jason Momoa isn&#39;t quite uncanny, but it&#39;s fine for a minifigure.</p>

<p>The parademon can also be found in the flying fox set, and it has plastic-type wings, which are useful enough.</p>

<p>The atlantean&nbsp;foot soldiers share the (incredible) helmets, torsos, and legs, and the only major difference is their heads. Both are useful, generic enough, but rare(ish). One belongs to Legolas and a Lexcorp henchman (there might be others) and the other belongs to one or two Anakin figures. (there might be others as well).</p>

<p>The build is a small shrine with a mother box. There&#39;s really nothing special, what you see is what you get.</p>

<p>The retail price, $20 in the US, is a little steep for what you get, especially after the build is competed, but now the set can be found for cheaper, therefore making the set generally worth it, especially for a gift or if you&#39;re a DC fan.&nbsp;</p>
