"1947andallthat","2018-08-18T00:13:02.08Z","Better than the movie, though that's not really hard","<p>Now, this is my first review, and, due to the nature of the holiday I&#39;m currently on, this review has been drafted across an entire week, so don&#39;t expect perfection.</p>

<p>I picked this up a few months ago on a decent discount at John Lewis, even though I&#39;ve just gotten round to building it. I quite liked the model from first impressions, despite its rather lukewarm reception, and the movie was decent enough to cement my desire to own this set.</p>

<p><strong>Box &amp; Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The set comes from a fairly substantial box, its artwork showing off all the contents of the set during the climactic battle of the movie. Upon opening, we are greeted by ten bags:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Two containing the many oversized parts needed in the construction of the Fox&#39;s hull</li>
	<li>Seven numbered bags, each containing one stage of the 955-piece build</li>
	<li>One bag containing the perfect-bound 200-page instruction booklet, the twenty-sticker sheet and the plastic sheet from which you have to pop out the two Parademons&#39; wings</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>As you&#39;ll have gathered, the build consists of seven stages:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 contains Batman, Steppenwolf and the first stage of constructing the Batmobile</li>
	<li>2 contains Superman and the parts needed to finish the Batmobile</li>
	<li>3 contains Wonder Woman and the core of the base, back and sides of the Fox&#39;s hull</li>
	<li>4 contains the Parademons&nbsp;and what we need to start on the front and top of the hull</li>
	<li>5 contains the fore and rear sections of the upper hull and the parts needed to finish off the sides of the hull</li>
	<li>6 contains Cyborg, the fore and rear sections of the bottom half of the hull, and what we need to get most of the upper hull completely done.</li>
	<li>Finally, 7 contains the parts needed to finish off the model, including the cockpit, wings&nbsp;and engines</li>
</ul>

<p>Initially, the build relies almost entirely on System parts and the only &quot;fiddly bit&quot; is&nbsp;getting the Batmobile&#39;s armour aligned. However, the early stages of constructing the Fox itself are almost entirely reliant on Technic parts. This can be quite complicated, and the frame is fairly brittle until its completion, but it makes the building experience a whole lot more interesting (even if I did make a couple of mistakes). The later stages of the model revert back to working almost entirely using System parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rare Pieces</strong></p>

<p>Now, I&#39;m not much of a parts expert, so all this research has been done using LEGO&#39;s inventory. You know, the one which contains 1013 pieces when the database says it contains 955. Oh, well.</p>

<p>According to said inventory, the following parts can be found in the Flying Fox and not many other places (I have used &quot;official&quot; names with number and ignored all printed&nbsp;components when writing this list):</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>An exclusive&nbsp;<strong>Batman</strong>&nbsp;variant, billed as wearing a tactical suit, is included to pilot the Batmobile, and he looks the part. As we have seen a lot lately, the printing on these otherwise unexciting black legs cuts off at the knees, but we still have kneepads, thigh armour and harness straps. Bruce&#39;s gold utility belt is printed on his grey torso piece, along with more straps, silver chest armour and the Justice League edition of the Batman logo. More of exactly the same, save for the chest logo obviously, can be found on the back, beneath a soft fabric black cape with a serrated bottom edge. Mr Wayne comes wearing the new &quot;chinless&quot; cowl, with a silver sweatband (if that is what it is) visible through the eyeholes. For accessories, we have a simple Batarang and a grappling hook with handheld launcher.</p>

<p>This set&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>Superman&nbsp;</strong>is shared with 2016&#39;s Clash of the Heroes. Unlike the Heroes of Justice: Sky High Battle version, this figure has plain dark blue legs, unfortunately leaving no trace of his boots. However, the torso is identical, dark blue with some gold and lighter blue detailing on both sides on top of the Superman logo itself. The character is completed by a soft red cape, a tousled black hair piece found in twelve other sets, and a double-sided headpiece; a charming smile on one side and a grimace with glowing red eyes on the other. As you might expect, the character comes without accessories.</p>

<p>This set&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>Wonder Woman</strong>&nbsp;minifigure&nbsp;first appeared in the Sky High Battle, but she still looks perfect in relation to her look in the modern-day DCEU. Her dark red legs don&#39;t use dual moulding to create her dark blue &quot;skirt&quot;, but the use of printing on the sides of her legs creates an excellent impression. Her dark red torso has golden detailing printed all over it, along with some brown straps, all of which looks brilliant in comparison with the movie; her arms are also printed with her silver bulletproof wristbands, which look equally fantastic. Her double-sided head - smiling on one side and grimacing on the other - features her immaculately printed golden tiara on both sides. Her dark brown hair piece, only ever used on Diana Prince or Kamala Khan, looks absolutely spectacular, full of flowing curves and subtle yet voluminous curls, all of which is perfect in relation to the movie. The Amazon comes with two weapons - a fairly short silver sword and a dark grey&nbsp;shield, printed with a golden border around a semi-abstract bird of prey.</p>

<p>However, of all the minifigures&nbsp;in the set, none&nbsp;look quite as good as the new&nbsp;<strong>Cyborg</strong>. The character&#39;s silver metallic body is covered in printing which perfectly represents the ribbed, angular armour&nbsp;of the character seen in the movie, along with some perfectly placed red highlights. The headpiece is even more impressive, perfectly representing what is left of the character&#39;s hair on his right and his brilliantly detailed and perfectly moulded artificial cranium on his left. The character looks just as detailed and accurate from behind, although there is no printing on his sides. This is made up for, however, by the fact that the character&#39;s right arm has been custom moulded&nbsp;to create an angular robotic arm just like that seen in the movie, and the effect works brilliantly. His hand has been replaced by an antistud&nbsp;intended to hold a silver stud shooter, adding a lot of playability and not ruining the character&#39;s overall look as much as I thought it might. He comes with no other accessories</p>

<p>Heroes are only as strong as the heroes they face, and as such two different&nbsp;<strong>Parademons</strong>&nbsp;are included as evil cannon fodder. Each character has a very different colour scheme, with one in blue, yellow &amp; grey and the other in dark tan &amp; two shades of green. The former may look more eye-catching, but both are printed with the same fantastically detailed armoured exoskeletons, which perfectly capture the characters&#39; insectoid nature. To reinforce this point, each comes with two pairs of translucent wings anchored via neck bracket, which make them look fairly imposing on display. Each comes with a handheld stud shooter to fight with.</p>

<p>While we&#39;re here, I&#39;m going to take the opportunity to mention the MacGuffin&nbsp;being fought over in this set, one of the&nbsp;<strong>Mother Boxes</strong>. These immensely powerful sentient computers are being tracked down by the armies of Darkseid, led by Steppenwolf, due to a rather handy characteristic of them; if all three boxes are left alone together, they will create an indestructible force capable of wreaking untold havoc across an entire planet. A dark red Mother Box can be found here, in the shape of a cube with a groove down two sides. The printed tile on top, decorated with Satanic-looking patterns and glyphs, looks absolutely perfect.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>The movie&#39;s primary antagonist, ruthless commander&nbsp;<strong>Steppenwolf</strong>, towers over the rest of the movie&#39;s cast, so he is represented here by an impressive brick-built figure; his imposing size in the film is clearly reflected, as the figure stands a full twelve bricks high. Like most of these characters, he is built on a frame of ball joints, so has an impressive level of articulation; unfortunately, he lacks knees or elbows, but his colour&nbsp;scheme means that this is a rare case of the universally grey&nbsp;ball joints not clashing with the rest of the figure&#39;s colour&nbsp;scheme, which is a welcome change. The colours used - red on the arms and fingers, with varying shades of grey&nbsp;and black across the rest - is fairly close to the character seen in the movie, while the printed designs found across the front of his torso and his specially moulded head look wonderful in relation to the movie. His sole accessory is a giant axe, which looks suitably threatening, although the clip used to attach it to his hand is a bit conspicuous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This model&#39;s version of the&nbsp;<strong>Batmobile</strong>&nbsp;is almost identical to the BvS version found in the Kyrptonite Interception, but the few changes made closely reflect those made in the movie. I&#39;ll&nbsp;cover the cons, first, since other than the slight difficulties in getting some of the armour aligned properly, there&#39;s only one real problem that I&#39;ve noticed. Both of the front wheels are attached to the same axle. If you don&#39;t know anything about engineering, this means that both wheels must constantly be turning at the same speed, which makes it extremely hard to make the whole car turn a corner. After some rigorous testing, I found that the car&#39;s turning circle is about as wide as the car is long; push it any tighter than that, and the back wheel on the side being turned towards will fly off. However, aesthetically, the model looks absolutely superb to me. It doesn&#39;t look perfect in relation to the movie, but I believe that the designer has done the best he reasonably can at minifigure&nbsp;scale. The stud shooters at the front of the vehicle look superb for once, and emulate the shape of the real vehicle&#39;s forward weapons surprisingly well, while the panels behind them, although hard to align, look excellent when properly placed. The left hand side of the cockpit looks perfect due to the use of an exclusive component; the other side looks a bit gappy, but I believe that there was no better way to incorporate a key feature of the car, the huge gun mounted above the right hand side of the car, which looks in itself fantastic; again, even the stud shooter looks decently placed. The cockpit interior, however, is less convincing, since it completely bare expect for some stickered&nbsp;dials and gauges. Yes, not even a steering wheel. Fortunately, the car regains some proper flare in the rear armour, where the designer has used plenty of hinges to perfectly capture the angular shape of the car&#39;s... looking at pictures from the film, it might be a spoiler or airbrake, but I&#39;m not sure. The back is not particularly well armoured, but the detail shown in the film would probably have been impossible to render at this scale. As such, I am reasonably impressed with most of the vehicle.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed on finishing the&nbsp;<strong>Flying Fox</strong>&nbsp;itself is its size; about 42 studs long and wide. It&#39;s really not captured that well on the box. However, despite this, the whole model is remarkably light, even with the Batmobile&nbsp;loaded, making it eminently swooshable in a single hand. I was worried that the Technic frame needed to make such a large, light model stable would lead to a tremendously gappy vehicle, but these gaps only appear when the model is held at eye level, as the underside is not armoured. Other than this, the only gaps are two thin cracks down the top of the vehicle, but, upon close inspection, I think that these gaps are unavoidable. They aren&#39;t even visible from certain angles. The interior is spartan, with the Technic framework on full show, but is impossible to see except when viewed at eye level through front or back. Four panels on the wall show various details relating to the armies of Apokolips, but there are only two designs shared between the four panels, which looks slightly odd. However, with the Batmobile&nbsp;loaded, there isn&#39;t any room for minifigures&nbsp;to reach the panels anyway. A room of some kind would have been very welcome, and in its current state the whole League can&#39;t fit aboard, but this would have required either a much larger model or a much smaller Batmobile. The car itself is securely anchored into place by four foldaway Technic pieces and some tiny wheel ramps, a pair of each at each end, which keep the car in place when folded away. On the other hand, the exterior of the model looks superb in relation to the movie, with short wings, movable steering flaps, large fins and a pair of large engines. Playability is provided by two stud shooters mounted atop the hull and a fairly discreet spring-loaded shooter under each wing. The prominent trans-red canopy lifts off easily to access two back-to-back seats upholstered in yellow, each facing a large control panel.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>I feel satisfied with this set. The minifigure&nbsp;selection is superb, especially Cyborg, and I feel like it provides the best overview available of the film&#39;s cast. Each of the three models does have some weaknesses which leave something to be desired - the lack of an interior in the Flying Fox comes to mind first - but each also has several strengths, and together they look like a cohesive and impressive unit on display. Overall, I feel like I&#39;ve got enough for my money.</p>

<p>And that is the key problem with this set. Sure, I was happy at &pound;70, but I would never consider paying a hundred pounds for what&#39;s sat in front of me now. The 997 pieces just seem to have disappeared into thin air. Personally, I would have preferred a larger craft with interior if I had payed full price. However, if you liked the movie (don&#39;t worry, I know I&#39;m speaking to a minority here) and you see this for &lt;&pound;75, I would almost certainly recommend picking it up. Unless you&#39;ve got something better to buy, which is actually fairly likely.</p>

"Anorak719","2023-03-28T07:58:53.453Z","Color me surprised","<p>I held off on getting this set (because I inevitably had to get it on the aftermarket) because even when it first came out, it looked gappy and hollow to me, like a skeleton of a thing, and I wasn&#39;t vibing with the design. After the Snyder Cut came out, I felt a lot more favourably towards it, Steppenwolf,&nbsp;Ray Fisher&#39;s Cyborg, and Batman&#39;s tactical suit, so that&#39;s when I really seriously started considering it. Seeing its return in the Flash trailer made me finally bite, as I imagine prices will inflate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build was fairly monotonous. I suppose this is a syndrome of large scale vehicles - I&#39;m a location fan myself - but I&#39;ve built large scale vehicles before, and they&#39;ve been more interesting than this build. It is very much erecting a skeleton and then filling in the spaces around it. Some&nbsp;useful stickers are included - Wayne Technology, display panels with Darkseid silhouetted - but interestingly enough, I really enjoyed the Batmobile build. I own the first Batmobile, from Dawn of Justice, but I bought it back when that movie came out 7 years ago (wow) so I don&#39;t remember the build. This one uses pentagonal shield pieces for the rear &#39;wings&#39;, which I think is an excellent choice. Steppenwolf is a straightforward build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When completed, the Flying Fox takes up a decent amount of real estate, actually. I don&#39;t know what I was expecting - again, the set has always struck me as &#39;hollow&#39; and &#39;skeletal&#39;, cause it is very much both of those things - but there is a nice heft and length&nbsp;to it that makes the entire thing, unwieldy as it is, distinctly swooshable. I think making this ship at this price and scale was kind of dooming it to begin with. At the price point and minifigure count they certainly&nbsp;<em>could&#39;ve</em>&nbsp;included more parts, but an extra 200 or so might not have fixed the wealth&nbsp;of problems that are present here: there just isn&#39;t enough interior spaces for minifigures, a lack of front or back door slash ramp is bothersome, and there are other major holes in the structure. I do think the designer must be commended for managing to evoke the ship at this scale&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;getting the Batmobile inside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Batmobile translates very nicely. I&#39;ve seen better MOCs, of course, but this isn&#39;t bad at all - the one major failing is the cannon, though. The integration of the stud shooter is clumsy, and while it&#39;s easily removable, it&#39;s a pretty weak attempt overall, as it is very gappy and blocky. It&#39;s held firmly in the ship, I swooshed the ship around with the car inside and it stayed put.</p>

<p>As is, this would probably register as a low 3.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigures are a pretty strong saving grace, however. The exclusive Batman is suitably detailed - his legs are really nice and the lack of dual moulding isn&#39;t really a problem here, and the exclusive head/shiny visor work really well for this character and look (mine came slightly&nbsp;misprinted on the scowl side, I&#39;ll have to see if I can talk to Lego about it, 6 years after they released the dang thing). I do wonder when we&#39;ll finally get some grey/black or light grey/black arms for Batman.</p>

<p>Superman and Wonder Woman are reuses and justifiable ones at that, although Superman could&#39;ve used the dual moulded boots he had for the BvS sets and a head that doesn&#39;t scream &quot;I eat boxes&quot;. Otherwise, they&#39;re both good, the Wonder Woman figure is great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cyborg is also excellently detailed, his sonic cannon arm is a really nice mould, to the point that his normal arm looks almost unnaturally plain in comparison.</p>

<p>I think the set could&#39;ve used another Parademon or two, or even another Leaguer&nbsp;- 955 parts, $100, 6 minifigures was a little lacking for 2017. Although props to Lego for including one of each colour in this set.</p>

<p>Like I said earlier, the built-up set alone would register as a low 3, even a high 2 without the Batmobile. It&#39;s pretty boring, so it was a good thing that this came when I was (a) sick and (b) binging Taskmaster. With that said, the final product is almost suspiciously enjoyable to fiddle with - I currently have it posed on my desk with the Batmobile tilted halfway out of the front, dangling in midair, which is a real thing you can do with the parts they use to keep the car inside the craft, and is also a disaster waiting to happen - and in conjunction with a very strong host of minifigures, this set has sneakily been elevated to a high 3. I was initially going to go for a low 4, but I can&#39;t in good conscience give it a 4 - really, the main build is a slog, and a long one.</p>

<p>However. This set is not going to be worth any aftermarket price you pay for it, unless you&#39;re in the region of retail (region meaning, single digits away). I paid quite a bit upwards of retail - not quite double the cost, and less than what I saw for it elsewhere - and I&#39;m still wincing a little bit at it. Am I glad I own it? Sure. Because I&#39;d want it eventually, and better now than in a&nbsp;post-Flash world. But am I glad I&nbsp;<em>bought</em>&nbsp;it? Not really.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a Snyder guy, but if you are, you&#39;re probably the target demographic for this set in the year 2023, Josstice-styled Steppenwolf aside. I likely would not recommend this to anyone else.</p>

<p>If, by some miracle, you find it for near the retail price, I would still not recommend it unless you have a real love for either cut of the film or the ship in general.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hope this helped.</p>
