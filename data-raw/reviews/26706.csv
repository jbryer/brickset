The build was ok but having Thor Ragnorok and Gladiator Hulk was my main goal. Getting the Grand Master was an added bonus.&nbsp;</p>

<p>was extremely repetitive and boring. That&#39;s a fairly generous description. It&#39;s an awful lot of red and blue bricks, and besides building the play features, there&#39;s not much variation. In fact, I&#39;d say that the build experience was the main drawback of the set. For these reasons, I&#39;d give the build a 2.5.</p>

<p><u>The Minifigures...</u></p>

<p>are, as we are used to with Superhero sets, the main draw here.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Thor</strong>, the main character, is represented well in this set. I specify that it&#39;s&nbsp;<em>this</em>&nbsp;set because this minifigure is reused in the other set created for this movie. In the scene the other set is based off of, the character is devoid of helmet, and the figure doesn&#39;t represent that. However, this is a fine figure, and I particularly appreciate the arm printing, which is highly useful. Thor includes a scabbard and dual katanas as well, which are servicable.</p>

<p><strong>Hulk,&nbsp;</strong>who is not technically a minifigure, is also a great figure. His helmet and armor are not removable, which is fine, and he wields a brick-build hammer and axe, both of which are similar in design to their on-screen counterparts. Overall, Hulk is one of the main draws of the set.</p>

<p><strong>Loki</strong>&nbsp;features the same helmet as his Avengers minifigure, which, while not necessarily accurate, was probably easier for the designers. However, it feels lazy when compared to the source material. He also includes an alternate black hairpiece, which is fairly movie accurate. I&#39;m not sure if this is a consistent issue, but my hairpiece popped off easily and would not push down all the way onto the head. His torso is printed well, and his legs are plain.</p>

<p><strong>The Grandmaster</strong>&nbsp;is unfortunately&nbsp;a bit of a letdown. In the film, he wears regal robes that have not translated well to Lego form. His legs are a drab gray with the robes printed onto it, which doesn&#39;t really work all that well. The hairpiece is also significantly less voluminous than Jeff Goldblum&#39;s locks, and I feel that a different hairpiece could have been used to better effect here.</p>

<p>Last but not least, the&nbsp;<strong>Sakaaran Guard</strong>&nbsp;is a filler character through and through. He feels like he was included to justify the price point of the set (more on that later). The design of the character feels like it was inspired by Jack Kirby&#39;s art, but without leg printing it&#39;s hard to feel like this figure is vibrant at all. In summary, it serves its purpose, but nothing more.</p>

<p>The figures in this set, despite their various inconsistencies and weaknesses, are fairly good as a whole, and for that reason I give the figure selection a 4/5.</p>

<p><u>The Final Set...</u></p>

<p>...is definitely a playset, and seems to be more oriented towards younger kids. You won&#39;t be able to move this around easily without bits and pieces popping out and lampposts tumbling over. The play features don&#39;t really detract from the set&#39;s overall appearance, and arguably make it more fun, but the set feels really light, substance wise.&nbsp;</p>

<p><u>OVERALL</u></p>

<p>I would give the set a 3.5/5, but because your score has to be a whole number, I&#39;ve marked it as a 3/5. However, know that I actually mean 3.5 when I say 3. This mediocre set is saved by its figure selection, which seems to be an unfortunate trend amongst location-based Marvel sets. As for the parts-to-piece-ratio, 492 pieces for $60 is not ideal. I picked up this set in a Target on sale for about $35, which was more than worth it. If you are interesting in purchasing a Thor:Ragnarok set, I would either purchase the other, superior set, or find this set for less than $55, which shouldn&#39;t be that hard.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-29T13:04:36.223Z","Ragnarock Unleashed.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #76088 Thor vs. Hulk Arena Clash:</b> 2017 Marvel Super Heroes sets included sets based on Thor Ragnarok and our first Jeff Goldblum Minifigure. This set is one of two offered that year and has its roots firmly centered in the World War Hulk inspired elements of the film.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: The standard LEGO Marvel Super Heroes box design is still in use after roughly eight years since the first sets were released in 2012. This means that aside from the different logos used for the various movies the standard red box colour is still in use. I&rsquo;m honestly a little surprised they didn&rsquo;t make any changes to this design, but I suppose if it isn&rsquo;t broken why fix it?</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: These instructions are massive. A really large manual that features the great step-by-step modular bag builds you get in these large type sets. This seems to be the last year where LEGO included comic books with all the Marvel LEGO sets as I have not received any from the 2018 sets I&rsquo;ve bought recently.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There are a lot of pieces in this set, however what stands out to me is the 1x2 brick element with the clip or bar on the end, which seems the most useful in this set. I do believe they offer MOCers a lot of potential when building their own creations.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Grandmaster: I, uh, I, may be the best of the best when it comes to Minifigures. I&rsquo;m after all in charge of an entire planet. Er, ummmm, ah, oh yes, I have two breathtakingly impressive facial expressions, a nice looking outfit with some great matching colours and no accessories because I don&rsquo;t need any.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Heh, heh, in all seriousness though the Grandmaster&rsquo;s a nice character to have and at least he&rsquo;s not an SDCC exclusive like his brother The Collector.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Hulk: This wonderful brilliant version of Hulk includes a lot of new sculpting for his Gladiator helmet and his armour on his shoulder. He&rsquo;s got a large hammer and axe weapon built accessory to do battle with and is a nice shade of green.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Loki: This version of Loki from Thor Ragnarok is dressed in a rich blue outfit and features a nice yellow cape using the new soft material version. For accessories he includes a spare hair piece to replace when he&rsquo;s not wearing his helmet, he also features a dual-sided facial print with a nervous expression on the back. It&rsquo;s nice to see Loki again in Minifigure form, as he hasn&rsquo;t been available since 2012. (They did not make Dark World based sets unfortunately.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Sakaarian Guard: This is meant to be from the same species as the Sakaarians we saw in the first Guardians sets as the villains. This guy does not share a lot of print elements from those villains, so perhaps this character is a slightly different member of the species. He has a staff for an accessory and that&rsquo;s about it, the detailing is fairly nice though with a lot of tech details. Overall a nice generic goon character to join the MCU Minifigs.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Thor: Here&rsquo;s a nice update for Thor with his outfit from the third movie. It looks great, he&rsquo;s got a lot of awesome detail work in his outfit, the torso, legs and head have a ton of authentic detailing. He includes a nice new sword sheath back piece, which may or may not have originated in the Ninjago theme, he also has his helmet for the first time ever.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Hulk constructs his weapons and the main section of the arena where Grandmaster will be sitting in the end. Hulk is best builder, he&rsquo;s also best smasher. It&rsquo;s a rather solid build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Thor and Loki build the Grandmaster&rsquo;s throne and add the two side-sections with the lights. Which are somewhat repetitive builds and using stickers for detailing. Not much else in this build to discuss actually.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: The Grandmaster enlists the Sakaarian Guard to construct the remaining sides of the arena which aren&rsquo;t identical builds, one side features a weapons rack while the other is where Loki sits. There&rsquo;s a final smaller section of wall being built which pretty much serves no actual point aside from being window dressing. There is a lot of sticker placement on all of the wall builds.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Arena Model: This is a pretty solid model, it features a lot of nice play features too. It&rsquo;s a tad unfortunate that most of them rely on the Super Jumper part introduced and then quickly tried to be forgotten. The large door opens to simulate the big reveal as seen in the film, the two lights can be knocked over by hitting them fairly easily, and you can also knock Grandmaster out of his throne by hitting it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Loki can be knocked over as well. The detailing while mostly relying on stickers is very well designed. The design of the wall sections can be disassembled and reattached in any configuration, purchase duplicates to make a fully circular arena. Overall this is one of the better models offered from the Marvel Super Heroes Theme.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a really solid little set and definitely one which a lot of people are going to want for their Marvel Cinematic Universe collection. Many play features are incorporated into this, even the sadly still in use Super Jumper, though they don&rsquo;t call attention to it on the front of the box compared to when that element was first introduced.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I would definitely recommend this set to fans if you can still find it two years after release. Especially as it is the only set to feature this version of The Hulk Big Fig. The modular nature of the model also helps if you want to make a larger arena display. Strongly recommended.</p>
