This is the Wonder Woman Warrior Battle, a set from the movie Wonder Woman (I thought it was a great movie but I won&#39;t spoil it). Anyways, let&#39;s dive into the review.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box is very typical. I was expecting it to be the longer thinner kind, but instead we got the taller thinner kind. Instructions are very easy to follow.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>A lot of interesting parts here. Many pieces are in dark tan and light tan, something we don&#39;t get often. There&#39;s also some dark blue pieces, like some 1 by 2s and the hood and cape for Wonder Woman. You also get the classic revolvers again, which is nice.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Figures</strong></p>

<p>The Wonder Woman figure has really nice printing all around. Basically her Batman versus Superman costume, but lighter. I really enjoy her though, since this is my first figure of her. It also matches the likeness of Gal Gadot. &nbsp;Steve Trevor is decent, with a nice coat, but I think they used Hawkeye&#39;s head and Captain America&#39;s hair in brown. I like the colors of the jacket and the hair, though I don&#39;t think it really captures the likeness Chris Pine.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The build was very easy and I got it done in about half an hour. Stickers are a bit tricky, but other than that, no complaints.</p>

<p><strong>Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>The completed model looks really nice. I like the realistic appearance of the warplane. Ares also looks nice, though he doesn&#39;t look quite like he did in the movie. Maybe it was based off of concept art. I think Ares looks fine though.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I highly recommend this set. The price point is well worth the money, the figures are nice, the builds are awesome and the parts and accessories are nice. Even if you haven&#39;t seen the movie, I recommend it to fans of Wonder Woman and those who are looking for a decent set. I also highly recommend you check out the movie</p>

<p>Thanks for listening to my opinion and I&#39;ll see you soon</p>

Sadly if you&rsquo;re not in Canada or Germany I believe Toy&rsquo;s-R-Us is gone. That being said this is a fairly impressive set for the Wonder Woman solo movie, it&rsquo;s got a lot going for it, some of it not entirely screen accurate, but hey that&rsquo;s how these things work.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: This box shows off Wonder Woman in all her glory as she prepares to do battle with Ares while Steve Trevor helps out in a plane. The box shows the set off very well and you can definitely get a feel for what you&rsquo;re building inside. It&rsquo;s one of those stand-up boxes as well with the image going vertically instead of horizontally, if that makes as much sense as it sounds coming out of my head.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: There are two manuals for this set as you build two separate models the individual builds are found in the two numbered manuals. You&rsquo;ll also find a sticker sheet inside for the details.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There is a surprising number of tan elements in this set due to Steve&rsquo;s plane, and a lot of interesting Technic and Constraction elements used for the model of Ares. It&rsquo;s a pretty solid set with some great use of parts to make the likeness of the models within.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Steve Trevor: Chris Pine joins the plethora of actors and actresses imagined in Minifigure form, the printed detailing is very nicely done with the flight jacket and the two facial expressions showing his cocky self-assured expression and his battle ready yelling expression. He includes a flight helmet with goggles and a spare hair piece for when he&rsquo;s not wearing it; as well as two pistols for accessories.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Wonder Woman: The print on Wonder Woman is gorgeous. She looks like she was plasticised and stepped right off the screen with every intricate detail of her on-screen costume captures quite elegantly, even the gauntlets on her wrists have been printed and the shield accessory has her signature Amazonian detailing. She includes a cape and hood helmet for when she&rsquo;s traveling incognito and her regular brown hair piece for when she&rsquo;s dealing with Ares or the Nazis party. (Use some of your Indiana Jones Minifigures if you own any for her to do battle against.) She even has a dual-sided head with a pleasant expression on side and battle expression on the other. Just an all-around great figure.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: The first manual starts you off with Ares as the buildable model. It&rsquo;s a pretty interesting build, as I failed to get the set with Giant Man in it (as of the time of writing this review) this was the first experience I had with building a super-sized Minifigure with bricks. This type of build is really ingenious turning the basic parts of torso, legs and head from a Minifigure into buildable model. The use of Constraction armor elements to flesh out the shoulders is a nice touch too. Those however are part of the next bags build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Building arms and legs for a giant brick-built Minifigure is a real treat. The technique to make LEGO pants in this style is awesome and a very nice use of the Technic pins.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: This entire build is Steve&rsquo;s plane and this is a very nice plane build. It is vaguely reminiscent of the model used in The LEGO Movie theme with the Wild West characters&hellip; I forget its name, but this build is a very nice and solid model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ares: This model is supremely impressive. The bricks are stacked together to make a sturdy looking buildable model. It&rsquo;s a character. It could almost be the third Minifigure in this set, but since it&rsquo;s made out of bricks and things it would never qualify as a Minifigure, and it&rsquo;s not a Big Fig&hellip; so have we coined a term for these buildable characters yet in the shape of over-sized Minifigures? Macrofigures perhaps?</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">His sword and shield are excellent accessories for dealing with Wonder Woman, and his head/helmet design is just all kinds of awesome. It&rsquo;s a real shame we didn&rsquo;t get to see this fight in the actual movie, the LEGO set has more going for it for a final climactic fight than what was shot and filmed.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Steve&rsquo;s Plane: This is a solid model. There are some stud shooters on the front to represent the real-world armaments found on such planes during World War I, but other than that there are no intrusive play features and it&rsquo;s just a solid toy to build, play with and display on a shelf. If you wanted to modify it to feature Brickarms or something similar would be very easy.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Get this set, get it if you can still find it anywhere because this set is just perfect. It features a plane model that a lot of us thought we&rsquo;d never see in such a realistic colour scheme and design, it features a buildable Macrofig with tons of personality and menace, and a pair of great looking Minifigures. This set is definitely worth owning, I would give this a Must Have rating, not just recommended, but why didn&rsquo;t you already buy this? The price is perfect, the models are great, there is only one thing really wrong with this set and that is the overreliance on stickers for detailing instead of printed elements.</p>
