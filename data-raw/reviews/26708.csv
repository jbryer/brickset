"toeboe","2017-05-19T16:55:32.543Z","Bounty Hunters? We do need that scum !","<p>This Bounty Hunter speeder bike set&nbsp;is another highly anticipated release for summer 2017, and at a UK price point of &pound;11.99 it really is a bargain.</p>

<p>Ok the build, yes i was expecting some usual nondescript vehicle but this little speeder bike is actually very nice indeed and it complements the bounty hunters very well, i have to admit the main draw of these battle pack&nbsp;sets tends to be the figure content anyway and not the build, that always feels like a bonus, but this is a good unique build, which&nbsp;looks great on&nbsp;display also.</p>

<p>On to the figures, oh yes ! Bossk,&nbsp;Dengar, IG-88&nbsp;and 4-Lom (new and exclusive to this set) lego really have pushed the boat out on this set, in my opinion for the figures alone the set is&nbsp;worth it, also given that these figures are from &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; it&nbsp;may be the last time they will get released (especially as more star wars films are made in the future) Bossk and&nbsp;4-Lom are the stand out figures in my opinion a more colour accurate&nbsp;Bossk than the previous release and 4-Lom for the very first time, the amount of detail that has gone into both of these figures is incredible even down to some very tiny printing on 4-Lom&#39;s&nbsp;eyes, Dengar is nice as is IG-88, again four different characters all bounty hunters all iconic, I do think given what&#39;s on offer this set&nbsp;could easily have retailed for&nbsp;&pound;19.99 without anyone batting an eyelid.</p>

<p>Only thing i didn&#39;t like were&nbsp;the inclusion of stud shooter&nbsp;blasters, most likely for younger lego&nbsp;fans to add playability but they are just the same old blasters again which are available everywhere, i personally ditched these in favor of the old style weapons which i have plenty&nbsp;of, in summary a great set, great price and great iconic minifigs overall its a must have set especially for the money.</p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><b><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Intro </font></font></b></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><font face=""Calibri""><font color=""#000000"">75167 Bounty Hunter Speeder Bike Battle Pack was one of the most highly anticipated Star Wars sets when it was revealed a few months back. The official release date was June 1<sup><font size=""2"">st</font></sup></font><font color=""#000000"">, but there were numerous reports of people being able to purchase from Smyths Toy Store in the UK earlier, which is exactly what I managed to do. Nevertheless it is now widely available and for a reasonable price of &pound;11.99 you can own four fantastic minifigures and a fairly decent vehicle. The box art neatly shows off all 4 minifigures and the included vehicle, enough to get you excited to open the box and reveal the contents&hellip;</font></font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><b><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Minifigures </font></font></b></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">I have only set my Lego sights on Star Wars sets recently and this one definitely piqued my interest as soon as it was revealed. The marriage of four amazing looking minifigures and a low price point was always going on the &lsquo;wanted&rsquo; list for many people. </font></font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""color: red;""><font face=""Calibri"">Dengar</font></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><font face=""Calibri""><font color=""#000000"">Previously only available in 6209 and 10221, I think this is the best version of Dengar yet. A very good representation of the character in Lego form. The bandages head gear looks great, as does the detailed head piece which does a fine job of highlighting Dengar&rsquo;s scarred face and continuing the bandaged part throughout. There is no double sided face as the headpiece does not go far enough down at the rear to hide this, but I&rsquo;m not too bothered with this as the one face we do get has a great expression and does justice to the character. The torso is very detailed with some lovely prints showing off Dengar&rsquo;s armour in Lego form. </font><font color=""#000000"">Now we get to the poor part &ndash; the legs are single moulded and I wish Lego had done a better job showing the differential areas of armour and &lsquo;clothed&rsquo; areas. </font></font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""color: red;""><font face=""Calibri"">IG-88</font></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><font face=""Calibri""><font color=""#000000"">Also only previously available in 6209 and 10221, this may be my favourite of the bunch. We have standard droid fare for the legs, torso and arms, so I won&rsquo;t dwell too much on these, apart from saying they look in the gunmetal grey. Now we get the </font><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""color: rgb(34, 34, 34);"">pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</span><font color=""#000000"">, the printed headpiece, I think it is amazing and Lego hit the nail on the head with this representation. I think it&rsquo;s great he gets a real life weapon (don&rsquo;t like the stud shooters!) like his in universe counterpart. Only downside to this figure is they could have done a better job / extra piece on top of the head.</font></font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""color: red;""><font face=""Calibri"">Bossk</font></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Ah, possibly my favourite figure in the set (see above for my conflict). This is a phenomenal minifigure and I have no real complaints about this one. Previously available in 8097 and 10221, this minifigure blows the other versions out of the water. Moulded head looks great as does the colour of Bossks armour. I&rsquo;ve read some complaints about it being the wrong colour or the wrong shade, but to me it&rsquo;s perfect. Again great printing on the torso and legs showing off various details. Amazing.</font></font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><span lang=""EN-US"" style=""color: red;""><font face=""Calibri"">4-Lom</font></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Another great minifigure and the first time he has been available in Lego form. Again the moulded head looks great and the overall printing on the torso and legs is superb. Can&rsquo;t fault this one at all as I think it is a great representation of the in universe character in Lego form.</font></font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">All in all we are really spoilt with the level of detail on each of these minifigures and I for one can&rsquo;t believe Lego gave us all four in one cheap pack. Kudos to Lego as sometimes we can be forced to pay for a set we may not want just for desirable minifigures. One thing I didn&rsquo;t like (with many others) are the stud shooters included, I would have preferred weapons like IG-88 had for all four bounty hunters. Saying this, these sets are aimed at children so I do understand the play value of these&hellip;</font></font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><b><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">The Completed Model </font></font></b></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Not an actual in universe vehicle but I think Lego did a great job of creating something a bit different and I do appreciate the light blue pieces it comes with &ndash; lovely colour. The majority of people purchasing this set will be doing so for the minifigures, and at &pound;11.99 the vehicle build is a nice little addition but definitely plays second fiddle to the minifigures.</font></font></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><b><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">Overall </font></font></b></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 10pt;""><font color=""#000000""><font face=""Calibri"">I&rsquo;ve said it before above but Lego really have spoilt us with this set. To get four rare minfigures in a battle pack is amazing value (in my eyes) and when this does get discounted you really are getting a great deal. Each minifigure is highly detailed and is worthy of their place in anyone&rsquo;s collection. The vehicle does play second fiddle but is a decent little build and has some nice coloured pieces to add to your collection. Don&rsquo;t delay and grab this delightful set. 5/5</font></font></p>

"jimjim66","2017-07-11T21:02:16.957Z","Bounty Hunters","<p>Box/Instructions: Small battlepack box with pictures on the back, 32 page instruction book,</p>

<p>Parts: 122 which is mainly for the speeder bike, grey and blue with a variety of parts,</p>

<p>Minifigures: 4 Bounty Hunters, Dengar, Bossk 4-Lom an IG-88, Each figure is represented well, Dengar and Bossk are the more famous of the four mainly due to Clone Wars, Freemakers and Star Wars Battlefront and to be fair they all have brief appearances in&nbsp;episode 5 or&nbsp;6 but Bobba Fett was always the more famous bounty hunter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dengar comes with his White Turban plus his back pack, Bossk&#39;s head piece has been molded beautifully, IG-88 makes use of battle droid parts but in dark grey and 4-Lom has an Ant Man esq head piece, all come with stud shooters</p>

<p>Build: Simple build, easy to follow, the speeder bike comes a long nicely, plenty of palyable features:</p>

<p>Overall Opinion: There is a part of me that starts to think with battlepacks you either get Speeder Bike, Mini Walker or Gun Platforms but lets be honest no one is buying this pack for the speeder bike, its the figures, when I first heard of this set I actually thought it was a joke someone was fake newsing but to see it released, to buy, to build, to own it is superb, I love the figures, Its a must have. it has value for money, they are Iconic figures, some have only ever been released in more expensive sets. I&#39;d recommend for anyone</p>

"batmanbatman","2017-11-08T03:30:44.093Z","A Nice Suprise","<p>I bought this set solely for the minifigures, and was pleasantly surprised by the build of the speeder. I am very impressed by the quality of the print on 4-LOM and Dengar, and although Bossk&nbsp;and IG-88&nbsp;are less detailed, their printing was still great. I also love that Lego chose to make the accent color&nbsp;on the speeder Dark Azure (Lego color ID 321), as it is always nice to get newer colors and pieces. In conclusion, a great set for kids and Minifig&nbsp;collectors alike.</p>

"jakeypoos87","2017-06-08T16:16:50.503Z","BOUNTY  HUNTERS!!!","<p>This is a very cool little battle pack. the build is a unique looking blue speeder bike with room to sit one mini figure. It has a very good build and design, there&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;also two stud shooters to play with.</p>

<p>The mini figures in this battle are the famous bounty hunters from the empires strikes back, these four mini figs are Bossk, IG-88, 4-LOM and Dengar. All these mini figs are amazing to get in such a small set.</p>

<p>Overall I&nbsp;think this is one of the best battle packs because of the speeders cool design and those very cool mini figs. I don&#39;t have any negatives about the set itself, but id wish it had included a zuckuss mini figure because he is one bounty hunter missing.</p>

<p>I would defiantly&nbsp;recommend this set and its worth your money. You would not be disappointed with it.</p>

"darthbdaman","2017-12-05T21:27:04.59Z","75167 Review - We need their scum","<p>Like most battle packs the main draw of the set is the minifigs. The speeder is quite nice and well put together though, and makes nice scenery if nothing else.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You get 4 of the 6 bounty hunters from the Empire Strikes Back, with Boba Fett and Zuckuss being left out. Leaving out Boba Fett is understandable, as he has been available in many sets right from the start of the Star Wars line (and is currently available in 2 different variations for ESB and RotJ). Not getting Zuckuss is really unfortunate however, as he has never been represented as a minfigure before. Someone was always going to get cut, but I would have preferred that it was one of the 3 figures that have already appeared before. That&#39;s not to say that the new figures aren&#39;t nice, but I would have liked to be able to finally get the complete set, and getting 4-LOM without Zuckuss feels like a cruel joke.</p>

<p><br />
The 4 figures that are included are amazing, and all except Dengar are new, with 4-LOM getting his first representation as a figure. Bossk and 4-LOM have excellent head and leg printing, and look incredibly high quality. Dengar&#39;s headwraps are well represented, and I&#39;m glad that IG-88 continues to be assembled out of battle Droid parts with cones and barrels, and wasn&#39;t given a new mold for a head. That might be more accurate, but it would lose a lot of the charm for me. The characters do only come with stud shooters (although IG-88 gets a backup rifle), but you probably have enough extra blasters that this isn&#39;t a problem.</p>

<p><br />
This set is good overall. It comes with 4 rare minfigures, and while I disagree with some of the choices, having the chance to get all these characters for cheap is very welcome. 4-LOM looks exceptionally excellent, and the set is worth it just to get this new figure.</p>

"Tupperfan","2017-12-19T00:42:13.05Z","Ideal for Army Building...oh wait.","<p>This battle pack set sets itself apart (really trying to use the same letters on my keyboard here), with 4 distinct minifigures&nbsp;representing 4 unique characters, instead of the more generic units seen in many battle packs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It results in a battle pack set that has&nbsp;intrinsic&nbsp;value(for a licensed model, of course), especially for minifig collectors, but one that, uniquely, doesn&#39;t offer much incentives&nbsp;for&nbsp;repeat purchases in order to build larger combat units.</p>

<p>The speeder model isn&#39;t a bad build for a battle pack, which have&nbsp;seen quite the numerous&nbsp;lacklustre models in the past;&nbsp;barely placeholders to meet some licensing deal regarding parts or content.</p>

<p>I will finish this review by expressing my loathing of the stud-shooting blasters. Isn&#39;t there any child safety rule anywhere that could prevent this kind of obscenity?&nbsp;And don&#39;t tell&nbsp;me it can&#39;t be done:&nbsp;I clearly remember the shooting pirate cannons being banned in North America!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I guess we could&nbsp;find solace in the one rifle we get with IG-88, so I clearly pick the droid&nbsp;as my champion to win this bounty hunting battle!</p>

"dRevan","2017-12-14T16:23:28.847Z","4 Bounty Hunters in 1 battlepack??!!!","<p>Lego have currently one bounty hunter in existence and that is Boba Fett. There were many sets in the past which gave fans many different bounty hunters but as of 2016 there was only Boba Fett. As of Summer 2017, Bounty Hunter Battle Pack was released for ravenous fans to acquire 4 bounty hunters under $20! In the past, the bounty hunters included have been scattered across different sets which makes them even more expensive to obtain.<br />
The set comes with 4 minifigures, the usual for a Battle Pack and one build.</p>

<p><strong>Set</strong>:<br />
The build is a speeder bike which has a very unique and cool design. The striking dark azure splashes make the model very attractive. The front has two engine pods reminiscent of a pod racer. There is seating for one figure. The sides have two stud shooters as well as dual cannons providing the vehicle with a lot of firepower. On the back there is an exhaust outlet along with a brown backpack.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong>:<br />
4 - LOM: The newest addition to the bounty hunter lineup. The head is a fantastic mold done in flat silver with copper used for the eyes. The eyes are covered with minuscule dark grey patches. The torso and legs are done in pearl dark grey with orange highlights. The torso print is very reminiscent of C-3P0.</p>

<p>Bossk: His last appearance was in the Super Star Destroyer which is now a very expensive set so getting him in a cheap set is fabulous! The head mold is done in olive green, a very accurate colour, with teeth detail. The torso and legs are done in bright light yellow which is, imo, a cool and a rare colour. The details on the torso are cool but the legs finally have printing including the claw detail at his foot.</p>

<p>Dengar: He is the same version that appeared in the Eclipse Fighter but I was reluctant to buy the set due to the price point and the non-canon theme of the Freemaker Adventures. The figure reuses the bandaged headgear as seen on the Clumsy Guy from Series 15. The face is similar to the last version but very detailed. The torso print is fine but the legs could use some print as well. He comes with a small build on his back to represent a backpack.</p>

<p>IG-88: In a world of human assassins, who needs a droid anyways? However, this figure appeared like Bossk in the Super Star Destroyer which is a very expensive set so its nice to get in a cheaper set. The face print on 1x1 cylinder piece is new and exclusive and the rest are just common parts. All figures come with the usual stud shooter guns but IG-88 also comes with a rifle which is surprising.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong>:<br />
This is one of the best Battle Packs Lego has ever made. The figures are fantastic and this is the cheapest way to get any bounty hunter aside from the keychains. My only gripe would be that Lego should have included blasters and/or rifles for all characters not just IG-88 but thats a minor issue. Even the speeder bike is not bad. It has some nice parts tucked inside.</p>

<p>All a person needs to make the scene from Empire Strikes back are the two $29.99 sets.</p>

<p><strong><em>Rating: 5/5</em></strong></p>
