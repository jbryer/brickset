"Minifig290","2017-06-03T16:53:31.72Z","Better than before ","<p>This is the best battle pack in my opinion cause of the figures and the build.</p>

<p>In this set you&nbsp;get 2 first order stormtroopers&nbsp;which are in high demand from what I have seen, along with them a flametrooper which are or use to be in high prices sets and a new and maybe exclusive first order officer. The bad things about these minifigures are their weapons stud shooters but can always be replaced by some blasters.</p>

<p>The build has two batons&nbsp;and new shield parts. The transporter has a fun and exciting build and uses a few cool parts like the two clear flags parts in transparent. This build is strong for the price of &pound;11.99.</p>

<p>This set is way better for army building than the 2016 fist order battle pack and is worth the &pound;12 you spend for 5 stars from me</p>

"The_creative_box","2017-06-15T11:29:27.94Z","Great minifigs, slightly disappointing build","<p>This is the second first order battle pack to be released, and is the best one in my opinion. It offers a reasonable price-to-part ratio, and the minifigures will make a great addition to your First Order army. Read on to see my further thoughts on the set!</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This set includes 117 parts, which is rather high for a battle pack, but many of them are small and 18 of them&nbsp;makes up&nbsp;the&nbsp;flametrooper and his flamethrower. The most appealing pieces are the new shield pieces (of which 2 comes in the set). They look great and are appropriately scaled, and I hope Lego reuses this element in other colors in coming sets. The trans-clear elements at the front of the speeder are very useful, and the six 1x2 slopes included in the sets make it a pretty good parts pack.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The big&nbsp;draw&nbsp;of the set is of course the minifigures. The <em>First Order stormtrooper </em>has very nice detailing on the helmet, as well as excellent torso/leg printing. This version has appeared in many other sets, however this is the easiest and cheapest way to get two of them from one set. All troopers in the set has the good ol&#39; generic angry-clone face.</p>

<p>The <i>First Order flametrooper</i>&nbsp;is only included in&nbsp;two other, quite expensive&nbsp;sets, and has a similar level of detail as the stormtrooper. He has a brick-built backpack, and his flamethrower makes a welcome change from the stud-shooters.</p>

<p>The inclusion of a&nbsp;<em>First Order officer&nbsp;</em>might divide opinions, but I think it is an appropriate figure and I think that it is better to&nbsp;get him in a battle pack rather than in&nbsp;a bigger set where he could replace a more desirable figure. The figure itself has a nice dark blue colour scheme, and his face has&nbsp;the old &quot;Lex Luthor&quot; face print.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>The tiny speeder&nbsp;looks good, it has some nice curves and lots of detailing, as well as storage space for shields,&nbsp;melee weapons, and&nbsp;stud shooters.&nbsp;There is&nbsp;a gunning spot in the rear, as well.&nbsp;The stud shooters in the front increases the playability, and gives the speeder an intimidating look.</p>

<p>What I dislike about&nbsp;it is the size - It only measures 12 studs in length, and is&nbsp;smaller than the average build you&#39;d&nbsp;expect in a battle pack.</p>

<p><strong>Overall thoughts</strong></p>

<p>The tiny&nbsp;speeder puts down the overall score a little bit, but the minifig selection is great&nbsp;and I appreciate the inclusion of the new officer. I recommend it to anyone who wants to expand their First Ordet army, and&nbsp;if you can get this at a slight discount like I did, it is the&nbsp;perfect army builder set.</p>

"coolbrickboy","2017-06-25T16:14:27.76Z","great set!","<p>&nbsp;In my opinion its a awesome set with a lot of playability! I&nbsp;like how lego&nbsp;put in some hard to get troops in this set! But i was thinking that the speeder would&nbsp;be a little bigger so it could transport more than just two troops.</p>

"SWBrickmaster05","2018-01-03T06:03:06.867Z","One of the best battlepacks?","<p>The 75166 First order Transport Speeder battle pack could, in my opinion, be one of the best battle packs LEGO&nbsp;has released in recent years. It comes with a nice selection of minifigures which are brilliant for army builders.</p>

<p><b>Minifigures:</b></p>

<p>Riot control stormtroopers (x2): These figures are excellent&nbsp;with their batons and exclusive shield prints. The helmet, torso and leg prints are nothing special though. Aswell as the wretched Angry Clone face!!</p>

<p>First order Flametrooper: Once again, this figure does not disappoint. The prints are satisfactory as are the flamethrower and backpack</p>

<p>First Order Officer: This first order officer is very exciting, as it is new and so far exclusive for this set. The printing on the torso is done well, although leg printing wouldn&#39;t hurt, would it?</p>

<p><strong>Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build of this set is short and sweet, coming in two small, unnumbered bags. It is very easy to put together, it takes no more than 10 minutes to finish completely. They include extra studs for the two built in stud shooters. There is also clips to store the riot troopers shields and batons, and the officer&#39;s stud shooter.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong></p>

<p>The price of this set is &pound;11.99, which seems to be the perfect price for lego&nbsp;battlepacks. If you are trying to army build however, you may want to try and find a cheaper deal. I would recommend picking up as many as you can if they are on discount.</p>

<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>

<p>To finish, I strongly believe that this is a competitor for the best battlepack due to it containing the right balance between officers and regular troopers. Even the vehicle is quite a good build. For &pound;11.99 you can&#39;t go wrong with this set.</p>

"Kesselproductions","2018-12-26T14:51:16.1Z","Is it worth it?","<p>This battle pack is pretty controversial through the Lego community and I&#39;m hear to talk about it. Thi battle pack has great figures for your armies and Mocs&nbsp;and the storm troopers look great in numbers. The point of a battle pack is to make armies and not of Bossk&nbsp;or Dengar, but of troopers. It is a great set to get flame troopers and storm troopers in too. It is a great battle pack all in all.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-07T22:29:29.35Z","Now this is a First Order Battlepack","<p>This is how a First Order Battlepack should be. You get a cool specialty troop that everyone thinks is cool but the troop can still be mass able, and you get 2 regular First Order stormtroopers with accessories that can be taken off to make them generic troops who are extremely mass able. The officer is not bad it just could have been an even greater battlepack if the officer was switched out for another first order stormtrooper. The other issue that correlates to the previous one is that if i buy multiple of these then if i have no other first order stormtroopers, then i will have only double the regulars than i do flametroopers and we don&#39;t need a 1/3 of our army being flametroopers. I would highly recommend getting multiple of these if you are a fan of the sequel trilogy and are trying to build a first order army.</p>
