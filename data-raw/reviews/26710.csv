All they did was faithfully recreate the ship from the movie.</p>

<p>This set really reminds me of the 75170 The Phantom from 2017 due to the the size of the set, minifigs, and pricing of the set. Both have 1 exclusive figure that looks good (Rose/Thrawn). Each have an improvement of a character already made, which reflects said character&#39;s new injuries (Finn/Kanan). And each has an an un-updated version of a droid that everyone has by now (BB-8/Chopper). While there is quite a low quantity of figures in this set, I believe the quality makes up for it.</p>

<p>The ship itself is fairly small, yet has lots of detail, due to the heavy dosage of small pieces and <strong>LOTS OF STICKERS</strong>! However, all the small pieces and stickers are worth it, because the models ends up looking great on display, and best of all, has a great interior. Much more than I&#39;d expect of a ship this size!</p>

<p>I just got this today (Force Friday 2) with double VIP points and got a free Scarif Stormtrooper, so while it has many similarities to the Troop Transport Cockpit, I believe that with either good promotions (like I got), or a reasonable discount of 20% (making it $24 in the US) it would be worth picking up!</p>

"LSWFan","2017-09-05T13:06:49.663Z","Great model, cool minifigs and nice playability","<p>The Resistance Transport Pod represents, at &pound;40, the cheap end of the first wave of Star Wars: The Last Jedi sets. &nbsp;It&#39;s a hefty price for a relatively small model (check out the difference between box size and model size) and just two minifigures, but this is where we are now with licensed sets so as long as we, the fans, keep paying it, LEGO will continue to charge it.</p>

<p>Anyway, that aside, it&#39;s a very nice set. &nbsp;This being Star Wars, you have to brace yourself for a lot of grey bricks and plates, and that is mostly what you get. &nbsp;Thankfully, it is broken up with some nice orange and is a joy to put together. &nbsp;The build is really interesting, with a few unique ways of joining the model together and three detachable parts which reveal storage areas on the ship.</p>

<p>The side come off to reveal a small bay for storing what look like tiny cans of Fanta but are presumably thermal detonators or something similar, plus a tool/blaster clipped to the wall. &nbsp;The rear top section comes off to reveal a small storage bay where you can sit BB-8. &nbsp;Finally, the sloped area to the side of the cockpit detaches and you can even store small items in there if you wish.</p>

<p>Completing the play features are a dual missile launcher and a nifty rotating blaster cannon, controlled by cogs and a turnable engine unit on the back of the pod. &nbsp;I&#39;m not sure why a transport pod is so heavily armed, but I guess the First Order are after the Resistance&#39;s supply of Fanta in a very aggressive way.</p>

<p>There are even very thoughtful holders for the blasters belonging to Finn and Rose (more on them later) located in the cockpit, which I think is ace and a nice touch. &nbsp;The cockpit itself does present the set&#39;s one major drawback, however. &nbsp;For a set of its size, there are loads of stickers, and most of them go on the orange cockpit canopy. &nbsp;One of them features a transparent panel to sit at the front - please learn from my experience and be careful how you hold this sticker. &nbsp;Otherwise you&#39;ll end up with fingerprints welded into the sticker glue of the canopy forever!</p>

<p>The stickers are easy enough to apply but it&#39;s a shame there are so many and a properly-printer canopy would have been great. &nbsp;But got to keep those costs down (hmmm, see price).</p>

<p>But what of the all important minifigs? &nbsp;First up, we have Finn. &nbsp;He has a nicely-detailed jacket and some extra printing on his trousers to represent a holster, making him look more than a little Han Solo-y. &nbsp;His hair piece is maybe a little too &#39;big&#39; but otherwise he looks good.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s Rose, who is a new character to the universe. &nbsp;The actor who plays Rose in the movie, Kelly Marie Tran, was introduced on the main stage of Star Wars Celebration back in April so I presume she has a reasonably sized role. &nbsp;Her&nbsp;inclusion as a minifigure only reinforces this. &nbsp;She has an excellent Resistance technician&#39;s uniform and a cheeky little haircut, which seems a pretty close rendering of what little we have seen of Rose so far. &nbsp;Both figures come with a calm/cheery face and a more worried/angry face, depending on the situation they are currently involved in.</p>

<p>Finally, there&#39;s BB-8. &nbsp;He hasn&#39;t changed too much from previous sets and still works well as a minifig, although I still don&#39;t like the proud connector at the bottom which makes him look like he&#39;s floating off the ground. &nbsp;Maybe this will be addressed at some point.</p>

<p>This is a great set. &nbsp;A nice build, good model and good minifigs. &nbsp;It&#39;s a shame about the stickers and the price, which are ironically tied together. &nbsp;The former to cut costs and the latter to drive profits. &nbsp;I shouldn&#39;t dwell on these though, as all LEGO Star Wars sets are expensive for what they are. &nbsp;Definitely worth a place in your collection.</p>

"abordoli","2018-01-11T02:32:36.597Z","Can't They All be This Good?!","<p>This set is what all sets should strive for. It has so many great &quot;features&quot; for such a small surface area. It feels like a mini-compact Millennium Falcon. I have not shelved this item and have in fact built a base for it.&nbsp; This was the first set of the year&#39;s line that I had built and it raised my expectation for later sets. Sadly, subsequent sets in the line didn&#39;t pack as much into this sort of space as this one did. Some sort of landing gear (I had to make my own) would have made this even better. Cheapest in the line and a strong contender for being the best.</p>

"Hashem1983","2019-11-15T16:34:17.747Z","My First Star Wars Set","<p>First, I am not one of the Star Wars fan in general, or know a thing about it but maybe from the Lego sets that I have seen and got some knowledge about it, so I am going to review this Lego set as a set despite the fact the theme that it came out from.</p>

<p>If I remember, I saw the set on a YouTube&nbsp;review and I felt in love with it and I wanted to have it. I checked Toys R Us in our region multiple of times but I never saw it on the shelves until I found it online with a reasonable price.<br />
<br />
The building experience of the pod was fun indeed, I have enjoyed every moment building the set, and no it was not symmetrical, the only hectic part was applying the stickers on the transparent yellow bow, the rest of the built went smoothly.<br />
<br />
What I liked about this set:</p>

<ul>
	<li>You can hold the pod from the back in any hand comfortably and with any hands you are holding the pod you can easily fire the spring-loaded shooter&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The mechanism of the rotating machine gun on the sides</li>
	<li>Fully closed</li>
	<li>Easy access</li>
	<li>Storage areas and popper places to stores the accessories.</li>
</ul>

<p><br />
The set also comes with 2 mini-figuers and a BB-8.<br />
<br />
Basically it is a very nice and a fun set for both play and display.</p>

"TioBella","2017-12-12T21:55:30.273Z","A New-fashioned brick-built space ship","<p>I want to add my endorsement of this cool little craft. &nbsp;In the states this is/was readily available for $23-$24, which represents great value (294 pieces 2.5 minifigs). &nbsp;While building this set and marveling at the use of limited interior space (two seats in the cockpit, spot for BB-8, spot for 2 blasters in the cockpit, storage bay for weapons and detonators), I appreciated the interesting parts including&nbsp;the use of the clear blue minifig heads in the propulsion system and&nbsp;the gun-metal macaroni pieces. &nbsp;There was also some interesting brick-building, and not a reliance on large pieces.&nbsp;I would&nbsp;think a printed cockpit couldn&#39;t be much more than the 7 stickers it uses but I guess not. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I feel like this set, like those space sets from the 80s, has enough interesting pieces that you can build a myriad of cool&nbsp;spacecraft. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This ship didnt have lot of screen time but it is stil recognizable because of it weir shape and the fact this ship is separate cockpit from the resistance troop transporter.It helped Finn Rose and bb-8 to get to Canto Bight.</p>

<p>LITTLE ABOUT IT</p>

<p>This set is incredibly compact when compare to size.When you open cockpit you can set up 2 minifigures&nbsp;(Finn to pilot place and Rose on other one) 2 guns to little clips.Then just hold the vertical stabilizer and pull it out.Then you can place bb-8 there.But if you are like me then you think&nbsp; it is shame because bb-8 is hard to see when you are playing.Luckilly, it isnt&nbsp;hard to place brick on whick bb sits and place it behind Rose.There is a small place to store 2 bombs and electroshocker&nbsp;that Rose used to shock Finn when he tried to escape.Next to the cockpit is ANOTHER storage area.in this one are 2 spare studs for stud shutter&nbsp; and old blaster(I think).Near the engines from back there is is one gray round piece.That piece makes stud shutter to spin 360 degree.Under that is most well hiden spring-loaded stud shutter&nbsp;</p>

<p>PRONS&nbsp;&amp; CONS</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-07T22:12:50.28Z","Better than I thought it would be","<p>When I got this set I wasn&#39;t expecting much. Then I got blown out of the water by how cool it is. There are so many things t do with it, repairs, reloading, blowing up, crashing, breaking apart. Whats really cool are the 2 printed thermal detonator pieces that are included, and I believe are the cheapest way to get these pieces. BB-8 is great to get and Finn and Rose are not bad either. There are some cool pieces on this set including 4 light transparent blue minifigure head pieces that are used to show the engine. The one big problem is that there are a lot of stickers to put on the cockpit and they are not easy ones to put on. I would highly recommend getting this set as it is great for the price it is and would make a great present to give to someone.</p>

"CaptainKindling","2020-09-26T17:19:41.32Z","A surprisingly fun build for an upsettingly high price.","<p>Lego didn&#39;t provide a great selection of Lego sets for collectors from The Last Jedi, with the focus seeming to be more on playsets, but they have delivered on a couple - namely the First Order Star Destroyer and this little Resistance Transport Pod.<br />
<br />
Now I have to admit I wasn&#39;t particularly excited by this set and only actually bought it because it was half price, but now that I&#39;ve put it together I can honestly say it was a surprisingly fun build!<br />
The set is split across three bags, which (as Star Wars Lego tends to be) are numbered to make the pod easier to build in stages. The set consists of just under 300 pieces, and the majority of those are small, so younger fans might benefit from the use of a tray to catch wayward blocks!<br />
The entire build clocked in at just over an hour, and that was with me taking things at quite a leisurely pace. Due to the number of very small pieces, young Lego builders would probably be working away at this for a while longer, but may need a little help from one of the bigger kids in the family!<br />
The build itself progresses nicely. Many of the sets I&#39;ve built don&#39;t start looking like anything until quite late stage in the build, but this is one of the few I&#39;ve done where it does seem to slowly take shape, which feels very satisfying. There are even a couple of neat little cogs and gears which later form the rotating cannons and missile launchers, which are pretty fun to put together (again, youngsters might need a bit of help with gear alignment).<br />
One area which might put collectors off is the number of stickers in this set. For a small set there are a lot of stickers (and I mean A LOT), and I&#39;m aware of the fact that a lot of adult collectors are really not fans of this trend. Getting these lined up neatly is another area where younger builders may need a little bit of assistance.<br />
<br />
Once the set is complete it makes a pretty nice little model. The orange fin and yellow cockpit canopy really make the model pop, and are a welcome splash of colour in a range where the ships generally boil down to various shades of grey. The cockpit is spacious enough for both Finn and Rose to fit in comfortably, and there are storage areas in the back and the side of the pod, although it&#39;s a shame that these are accessed by removing the panels rather than through a hinged mechanism, which I&#39;m sure could have been easily achieved.<br />
The cannons on the side of the pod rotate by turning a wheel on the back of the ship, which is a really cool little touch (and one I spend far too much time playing with), and the missiles set into the underside of the pod are launched by turning a small wheel on the side.<br />
<br />
And then the minifigures! The pod comes with Finn and BB-8, both of which are available in a number of other sets, and Rose Tico, who is a bit more of a rarity in Lego form.<br />
<br />
The only real downside to this set is the price. For a set which is less than 300 pieces, &pound;40 is extortionate even by Lego&#39;s standards.<br />
<br />
So a nice little set with some fun features, and enjoyable build, a brand new Lego hero in Rose, but just let down by an unfortunately high price tag!</p>
