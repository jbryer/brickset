"LSWFan","2017-09-25T23:24:00.93Z","Solid but Unspectacular First Order Set","<p>By now, we&#39;ve all seen that Lucasfilm are revising a number of older Star Wars vehicles in newer movies, so here it is...the AT-ST! &nbsp;Ahem, I mean of course, the First Order Heavy Scout Walker. &nbsp;Yes.</p>

<p>I was in two minds whether to get this set, but I coveted the General Hux minifigure&nbsp;and in the end that was my primary reason. &nbsp;Somehow I imagine I&#39;m not alone!</p>

<p>Seeing as that was the main draw, for me at least, I&#39;ll start with the minifigures. &nbsp;Hux is a good reproduction of Domhnal Gleeson&#39;s snarling First Order commander, complete with authentic sideburns and a very precise parted haircut. &nbsp;He also carries a blaster, which either means he is going to be more &quot;hands on&quot; in The Last Jedi or LEGO have done their fairly usual &quot;give everyone a blaster&quot; gambit in this set.</p>

<p>Aside from Hux, you get a First Order Scout Walker driver, who is a pretty standard figure of its type and not terribly interesting. &nbsp;Then there&#39;s a flametrooper. &nbsp;LEGO love these guys as they crop up a few times in The Force Awakens sets and the design here is the same. &nbsp;Finally, there&#39;s a Resistance trooper resplendant in her drab uniform which is at least nicely detailed and she has a funky visor on her helmet. &nbsp;It&#39;s a two-faced figure and in a major change for a Star Wars item, one side is neutral and the other smiling, so here&#39;s one member of the Resistance who isn&#39;t too stressed out.</p>

<p>All in all, a not bad but not terribly exciting selection.</p>

<p>At &pound;50, the Heavy Scout Walker is the second cheapest set in The Last Jedi first wave and it&#39;s moderately bigger than the overall superior Resistance Pod (check out my review <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75176-1/Resistance-Transport-Pod"">here</a>). &nbsp;In a major twist for Star Wars vehicle design it&#39;s...grey. &nbsp;There are&nbsp;splashes of red and green around the cockpit but otherwise it&#39;s grey. &nbsp;And dark grey.</p>

<p>As a build, it&#39;s a mixed bag. &nbsp;Featuring eight legs, the Heavy Scout Walker doesn&#39;t surprise you with most of the construction featuring them. &nbsp;I find these stages of a build pretty monotonous but at least they&nbsp;aren&#39;t too fiddly to put together, and once sat on their wheeled undercarriage, LEGO have integrated a funky scuttling mechanic when you push the vehicle forwards. &nbsp;I can&#39;t wait to see this thing moving in the movie&nbsp;as it&#39;s quite a departure from the older AT-ST, which it so closely mimicks.</p>

<p>Sat on top is the cockpit/cabin and this is well&nbsp;detailed with a nice tandem seating arrangement inside. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t rotate at all though, which seems odd. &nbsp;Perhaps the movie will explain this. &nbsp;Guns feature on the front and rocket launchers on the side. &nbsp;LEGO have included flick-firing projectiles here, and although I like the play feature as a concept, the big red rockets sticking out of the sides look a bit ridiculous.</p>

<p>The Heavy Scout Walker is a functional, odd-looking set with a decent accompaniment of minifigures. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an essential purchase unless you really want General Hux (you know who you are, Hux fans). &nbsp;It may also look very cool next to the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75189-1/First-Order-Heavy-Assault-Walker"">First Order Heavy Assault Walker</a>. &nbsp;Buy them both and you&#39;ll probably feel pretty good about it.</p>

"Resurgam","2017-10-15T07:19:16.37Z","Underrated Set","<p>I thought from pictures that this set would underwhelm me.&nbsp; Despite the piece count, the price seemed a bit steep before I built it.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;m happy to say that this build offered a fantastic building experience that was a lot of fun.&nbsp; It took me maybe 2 hours (though I savored the experience and built slowly) and there was a diverse number of build tactics.</p>

<p>The final product is a lot larger that it appeared from photos and I&#39;m quite pleased with that.&nbsp; All things considered, the $50 price point I initially balked at seemed reasonable after the build, although now it seems you can get it at a discounted price of $40 at most retail stores.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a &#39;Star Wars&#39; fan, I would highly recommend this set.&nbsp; I will likely pick up a couple more for armybuilding.</p>

"abordoli","2018-01-11T02:39:44.81Z","Nice Technical Build, But Where Was It In The Movie?","<p>I was SO looking forward to seeing this in operation during the movie. Allegedly it appeared for half a second (which I can only confirm upon another movie viewing). This is a very imaginative and technical build. The legs are not as full-of-motion as you&#39;d guess. It&#39;s more of a tiny, jittery,&nbsp;crab-scuttle than anything.</p>

<p>The framework for the legs to move in clock-work fashion was quite unique, but the building of 8 identical legs was tedious work. The vehicle actually runs on wheels which in turn causes the legs to simulate movement.</p>

"CC_2224","2017-12-30T23:53:23.833Z","Good Looking and Semi-Functional Model","<p>The First Order Heavy Scout Walker never appeared in Star Wars The Last Jedi. As a Lego set however, it looks nice and fits in with the Star Wars theme. The set&#39;s main function is to move the legs that emulate a &#39;crawling&#39; function. Unfortunately, the head cannot move at all which hinders the use of the spring loaded shooters. The biggest draw from this set is&nbsp;the new General Hux minifigure with his hairpiece. Hux is now available in a cheaper set than Kylo Ren&#39;s Command Shuttle. The set has a phenomenal price per piece ratio of $0.09/Piece in the United States.</p>

<p>The building experience was perfectly acceptable. There were no stickers which is always best, there were challenging aspects in the skeleton of this build, but the repetition in the eight legs is a drawback. Becuase it is a smaller build for a Star Wars set, the repetition doesn&#39;t really hurt it.</p>

<p>This set has no issues in the parts. They don&#39;t hold back with their selection, and the detail adds to the walker. As I mentioned, there are no stickers which is a huge positive to the set.</p>

<p>The playability of this set is good. The walking feature works well on hard surfaces, and the blasters can be turned to fire at minifigures. The big issue is that the head cannot be turned which limits the fun in playing with this walker.</p>

<p>The minifigures in this set are very good figures, and a logical distribution between the First Order and the Resistance. The First Order Crew member is the generic one that had been produced since Fall 2015, as is the Flame Trooper. Both are good and appropriate figures. The new Resistance Trooper with the green helmet is good and well detailed, but there is no chin bar included which should have been provided as an option. The most important minifigure and most important aspect of the set is General Hux. While&nbsp;there are the same legs, torso, and head parts included in the Command Shuttle, this set includes Hux&#39;s hairpiece (Which is the exact same as Obi-Wan&#39;s). The figure looks nice and accurate to his appearance.</p>

<p>This set has a value comparable to that of a non-licensed set of 9 cents per piece in the United States. This is very fair because we are dealing with a set that is currently not authentic to the Star Wars universe. The great value of this set makes it something still worth picking up.</p>

<p>While this may not make for the best product to give&nbsp;a Star Wars fan or collecter, it is a cool toy that is fun to play with, and comes with a desirable minifigure.</p>

"MadDanX","2017-12-09T12:39:53.887Z","Interesting and Underated Set","<p>After reading and watching reviews that warned me about this set, I was on the edge of not buying it at all!!! However after taking some time to ponder over that price point I just went for it and got the set.... and I was DELIGHTED by my decision.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Pros:</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Building Experience/The Build:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>In all my years of LEGO (just under 10 years now for Star Wars) I have never seen as a unique build as this due to the way it is built up.</li>
	<li>The mechanism that it uses is built spectacularly and is very sturdy if you dropped this set from table height (apart from the head maybe coming off) the legs would hold together.</li>
	<li>Quite a fun build as some of the techniques are a bit more advanced which is a lovely experience and challenge for new builders.</li>
	<li>The texture (greeble) on the head and legs is nice.</li>
	<li>Most&nbsp; technic pins are hidden well with barely any on show when stationary or moving.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Some unique parts came in this set that are not too common such as the transparent red blocks.</li>
	<li>An excellent booster kit if you like technic pieces I could see some good alternative builds being made.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The mechanism movement works amazingly making the walker to appear machine like.</li>
</ul>

<p>The minifigure selection is very good with this set:</p>

<p>- The flame trooper is a nice army builder like always.</p>

<p>- The first order crew member is a good addition to drive your walker.</p>

<p>- The FEMALE resistance trooper adds a nice addition to any Force Awakens resistance sets (especially the battle pack).</p>

<p>- General Hux is the star of the show having an excellent print on the legs and torso and also being a great figure to lead the First Order in to battle.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Just from putting the figures next to model (I haven&#39;t seen any source material yet for the walker as the film isn&#39;t out at the time of review) it is quite good in height when putting minifigures next to it.</li>
	<li>Design looks good with other sets on display.</li>
	<li>This will not fall apart in a kids hands it is a very STRONG and STURDY build.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Cons:</h2>

<p><b><font color=""#444444"">Building Experience/The Build:</font></b></p>

<ul>
	<li>The build for the legs can be quite repetitive as it is practically 8 times the same thing. However as I said earlier it is still quite a challenging build.</li>
	<li>The canon at the front can come off sometimes when knocked.</li>
	<li>The missiles on the side stand out meaning they can be fired quite easily when moving around.</li>
	<li>Head could have been a bit bigger at this price as not much space inside.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font color=""#444444"">Parts:</font></b></p>

<ul>
	<li>No problem here at all very good pieces.</li>
	<li>Piece ratio could have been larger but meh its a good amount.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><font color=""#444444"">Playability:</font></b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Head does not move up, down or around (made up for by missiles turning and the menacing look).</li>
	<li>Two is possible in the cockpit but it can be a squeeze.</li>
	<li>If moved at extreme speed the mechanism does not always work.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>In conclusion, I think this set is a must have if you are a Star Wars fan!!!</p>

<p>This is a very well built set that is sturdy, has an excellent minifigure selection, as well as having quite a nice mechanism that is nice for any Star Wars fan to play with.</p>

<p>I think that this set is underrated compared to the other Last Jedi sets as it may not appear on the box as impressive in comparison to something like the Star Destroyer (review on that coming soon), but once out of the box and while building it you will appreciate what you have bought/been given.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is not as big in height compared to some other sets previously around this price point (e.g. AT-ST from last year) however this set&#39;s mechanism, width, menacing look, <strong>minifigures</strong> and strength overall definitely make up for this. I could see an army of these being formed marching upon a moc rebel base which I cannot say for the AT-ST Walkers.</p>

<p>My recommendations for this set if your pondering on buying it and are in no rush to get it is to wait for it to drop in price to &pound;40/$40 or below. I mean at &pound;50/$50 you are getting value but sometimes waiting till Boxing Day sales or even Easter Sales might be better (e.g. I got the AT-ST last year for &pound;20).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for reading this review!!! Please smash the helpful yes button as it inspires me to make more reviews!!!&nbsp;</p>

"J14T14","2017-11-01T12:38:12.497Z","Strangely Underrated","<p>When I first saw this set, I thought that it was interesting and I wanted it right away. It reminded my of the separatist crab droids that we saw in the clone wars show and briefly in episode 3. When I got it, this set, the 8 legs were boring to build and repetitive, but the head build brought a needed change. When I was finished, I thought that the finished model did look strange, but interesting. We haven&#39;t seen this in any trailers, posters, or&nbsp;other toys or any memorabilia from The Last Jedi yet, so I kept an open mind. I like how the mechanism for the legs work to move up and down with the (not so hidden) hidden wheels. I think that if you put this on display, it looks best from strait on to about a 45&deg; angle. The spring loaded shooters look odd on the side of the walker, but they do add a lot of playability to the model. There are two clips on the back to hold any spare shooting pieces. Inside the head, there is room for 2 minifigures. It is hard however to fit them in with their blasters but it is possible. I like the minifigure choice with this set. The flame trooper is a nice inclusion along with General Hux and our&nbsp;first female&nbsp;resistance trooper. The first order crew member is one that I could have done without. This set could have used a specific walker driver instead. This set is the first full sized walker from the LEGO&reg; group to not&nbsp;include a specific walker driver so it is disappointing that we didn&#39;t get one. The $49.99 price point is pretty fitting for this set with it having 554 pieces. It is a little small however and it feels like it should be closer to the size of the LEGO AT-ST&nbsp;or their AT-DP. Over all, this set is for those who like new things and want something new to the Star Wars galaxy. It is also a must need if you want to get all of the Last Jedi&nbsp;sets because this vehicle&nbsp;may have a larger roll in the movie than we al think. But as Snoke said in The Force Awakens to Kylo Ren, &quot;We shall see.&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Update:</p>

<p>So as it turns out, this set is based off of concept art for a vehicle that was supposed&nbsp;to be on Crait. It looks like it was cut out of the movie late into pre-production, but it is still considered to be a part of the official Star Wars&nbsp;Canon. Compared to the concept art, this set looks great and LEGO did a great job on nailing the look despite the fact that it never made it into the movie. Hopefully this design is used somewhere in future Star Wars media so that this set will not be a complete wast of LEGO&#39;s time.</p>

"VenatorBricks","2019-06-07T00:04:07.617Z","A major disappointment....","<h2>Set:&nbsp;</h2>

<p>As a set, this set is not attractive, especially with&nbsp;the fact that it was not featured in The Last Jedi. It&nbsp;just doesn&#39;t fit in with the other sets. The build is also super repetitive. Some things about it are interesting, though.</p>

<h2>Price:</h2>

<p>Even though I got this for $20 on clearance, a set being $30 off shows that the original price of $50 is not&nbsp;worth it. The minifigures are common and generic. This set just was not worth it.</p>

<h2>Playability:</h2>

<p>The only real play features are the overused spring-loaded shooters and the wheels. I really do think the rubber wheels work well.</p>

<h2>Display:</h2>

<p>This set is just ugly. On the shelf, it just has a weird&nbsp;design that doesn&#39;t look good next to other sets.</p>

<h2>Overall:</h2>

<p>This set is a disappointment that shouldn&rsquo;t have ever been created by LEGO in my opinion, but still has enough unique features to be worth it to some.</p>

"CPMoellering","2020-12-28T14:45:15.627Z","Tiresome build","<p>Rebuilt this one recently and forgot what a tiresome build it is. The walker mechanism is made up of 8 &quot;legs&quot; that are all exactly the same and that make up most of the build. The turret is okay, but SNOT-intensive, which isn&#39;t my favourite. (Studs not on top)</p>

<p>The playability is limited, as the finished product feels more like a pull-toy to me than anything else. Some interesting parts, mostly the trapezoid-shaped frames which I have used in MOCs with success.</p>
