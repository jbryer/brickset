This is due to it&#39;s scarce screen time of only a few seconds where is gets blown up by TIE Fighters at niima outpost. The interior of the ship is basic, just, light bluish grey at the front and back. The 2 minifig compartments are not linked due to the exploding function mechanism and are meant to face in opposite directions, one being the cab, the other a turret. The cab has 2 seats, which are 1 behind the other. The seats are simple and the computer panels are put onto the back o some brackets to the side of the pilot. The turret at the back is&nbsp;a flawed design however as to get any access to the turret you have to&nbsp;lift up the access hatch for the gunner, exposing them to the outer atmosphere which would kill someone.</p>

<p>The exploding function is&nbsp;a major part of the set&#39;s design as this was a large part of the ship&#39;s role in the movie was to blow up and the function reflects this and, provided it on a hard flat surface will explode when the trigger on top is pressed which pushes out the 2 top engines are knocked out. On the topic of the engines, they are all well-formed and have a refreshingly new build for the dark orange paneling over the silver engines. I must also add that the cockpit piece is perfect and the build is very interesting.</p>

<p>There are 4 figures and BB8.They aren&#39;t anything special; Rey, Finn, Unkar&#39;s Thug, a Stormtrooper and of course BB-8. Rey, Finn and BB-8 are the same as normal, they have decent prints and their regular weapons; Rey has her staff an Finn has his blaster. The Stormtrooper has a different print to normal with some type of heavy artillery vest over the regular white plastoid armour. He is armed with a simple blaster. Unkar&#39;s thug is an interesting case as it was previously released in a dk book as an &quot;exclusive&quot; figure which remained completely unchanged. The figure itself is very nice and uses the combination of olive green, dark brown&nbsp;and dark tan to create a very ragged look.</p>

<p>Overall, I think that the set is a very complete build, with no glaring flaws in the design. However, the turret doesn&#39;t work properly and the build is very small, especially for the price point and neither the pieces or figures make up the value. Despite only having&nbsp;a 2017 release, it is already much cheaper online, costing as little as half the rrp.</p>
