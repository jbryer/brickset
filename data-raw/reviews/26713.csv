&nbsp;When I saw the set on the shelf&#39;s I knew I had to get it eventually. &nbsp;I am happy to see the Guavian&nbsp;Death Gang in Lego form. &nbsp;I was really excited when I got it to build and to play with it. Let see if it lives up to my expectations.</p>

<p>First the box. Nothing really special about it same top right corner&nbsp;&nbsp;design as that year. The instructions are in one packet. Nothing&nbsp;special but still decent. 5/5</p>

<p>The minifigure&nbsp;selection gives you some of the minifigures&nbsp;you would need to replicate the scene&nbsp;of the movie including 3 exclusive figures. &nbsp;The rathtars&nbsp;are brick&nbsp;built figures. Nothing really interesting other than maybe some new parts in the colors for some people. The design of both are exactly the same but different colors and can get a little repetitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bala-tik&nbsp;&nbsp;and the guavian&nbsp;sentury&nbsp;guards&nbsp;are exclusive to the set except in this&nbsp;years advent calender. I like the detailing on all 3 Minifigs. They come with &nbsp;3 identical stud shooters. The guards are exactly the same. The only complaint &nbsp;is I wish there were more movie accurate weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Han Solo and Chewbacca&nbsp;&nbsp;are &nbsp;the exact same as in the &nbsp;tfa falcon . But Han has a new head for this set. Overall based off of I do not have the sequel falcon, these 2 minifgures&nbsp;are decent and I like chewie&rsquo;s new bow cross with the&nbsp;&nbsp;stud shooter. Overall&nbsp;5/5.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build &nbsp;can get a little repetitive in some sections but is still decent. Mainly consisting of gray and tan pieces. The build includes&nbsp;&nbsp;a few functions and spots for the rathtar cage. &nbsp;The functions are just the 2 doors and the little lift like thing going up and down. There are some new parts in new colors for some people, but just nothing unique. &nbsp;Overall&nbsp;4/5 because of the repeating steps and general color scheme.</p>

<p>The model is fun to look at&nbsp;if you want to display, think the designer had it for both&nbsp;play and display&nbsp;and you to have multiples with the 2 pin areas. It will look good if you display it too. It is good set for Lego Star Wars fans who like to complete all the scenes of a particular movie and can re-enact&nbsp;the scenes while you play with it. Sometimes the cage can&nbsp;get a little hard to keep level with the rest of the set and probably have to separate to store the set.Overall&nbsp;good set 5/5.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall&nbsp;this is a pretty decent set of the 2017 line of Lego Star Wars. This is not perfect, but not terrible. Like how Lego did it, especially with no stickers. Decent sets for people who display and play. Thanks for reading my first review.&nbsp;</p>
