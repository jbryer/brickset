<p>This set though is totally different, the centre piece is definitely the tank which is a reasonably good size, had a great solid feel about it when constructed and looks cool into the bargain.</p>

<p>The build itself is fairly straightforward and can be achieved in a fairly short timescale, but to shows some different and clever techniques for building your own creations.&nbsp; The use of sloped bricks is superb and results in a model that looks very professional with relatively few exposed pegs.&nbsp; The colour scheme is nice with some small splashes of lime green which act as superb highlights to the standard republic red/white colour scheme we are used to seeing.&nbsp; However replace these lime green bricks with another colour and you could effectively have several representing different divisions or rank, nice touch.&nbsp; The only strange thing which I&#39;ve seen in various models in recent years is when some bricks are supplied in an unusual colour, but then in the build get covered/encased with the generic colour the model is built in.&nbsp; This happens here as well with some lime green blocks/plates being built internally where you&#39;ll never see them as they end up fully encased, strange, why do this you may as well have stuck with plain white or red blocks instead.</p>

<p>Anyway back to the tank itself, it has a pair of articulated gun mounts on the side of the superstructure, each featuring a stud gun and a laser cannon.&nbsp; This is a nice touch and the only possible improvement may have been to have a turret instead of these mounted onto the superstructure as you&#39;d normally expect on a tank.&nbsp; However in the overall design it works giving the impression of a fast, maneuverable light tank which using agility could bring the guns to bear.</p>

<p>So for a model I would give the tank a good 9 out of 10 both for build and value for money bearing in mind there are also 4 figures included in the pack.</p>

<p>Talking of which in terms of figures you get 2 x Trade Federation type standard droids with the usual blaster rifles.&nbsp; But the highlight is the Jedi Aayla Secura and the Clone Trooper Gunner.&nbsp; Aayla is not to my knowledge such a widely available figure and is a welcome addition to my collection.&nbsp; Similarly the Clone Trooper is a superb model with some nice crisp printing and a slightly modified blaster.</p>

<p>So overall a great set at a very reasonable price point.&nbsp; I can see myself buying several of these to have a nice little squadron of them!!&nbsp; Nice one Lego!! :)</p>

"Echolord","2017-06-07T18:04:56.633Z","Send in the TX-130 Saber Tanks","<p>Back in 2008, the LEGO Group released <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7679-1/Republic-Fighter-Tank"">7679 Republic Fighter Tank</a>, in the first year of the Clone Wars subtheme. The set featured two single phase 1 Clone Troopers, both in the Clone Wars style. For its time, it was a well designed set, with some really nice sticker detailing. It was a set that I really wanted, and sadly, was never able to get at a reasonable price.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, as part of the 2017 summer wave of sets, the LEGO Group has released a new version of the tank, 283 pieces smaller, but it appears to have a much sleeker look, much more in line with the more recent designs for the military vehicles of the Grand Army of the Republic. The new model features four minifigures, and contains 305 pieces. I was enthusiastic to build this, and see if it lived up to my expectations.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>The set contains four minifigures, two of which are new and exclusive to this set. The other two are generic Battle Droids, which have been featured in a total of 23 sets since its first appearance in 2007.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first of the two exclusive figures, and likely the most popular, given her rarity in minifigure form, and her popularity amongst Star Wars Fans, is Jedi Knight Aayla Secura. Her only <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw284/aayla-secura"">previous release</a> was in 2010, in that year&#39;s <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8098-1/Clone-Turbo-Tank"">Clone Turbo Tank</a>, based off of her appearance in the first season of the Clone Wars television series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new version of Secura is based off of her appearance in Episode III: Revenge of the Sith, in which she is killed on Felucia. Her torso is dark azure, as is her head, and the mold that makes up her lekku. She has a double sided face, one with a gentle smile, and the alternative with a look of disgust, or anger. Both faces capture the appearance of the character, as well as her personality, incredibly well. Her lekku, the twin head tails of her species, are made from the same mold that was introduced for her character back in 2010, and has since been used on two other characters, Oola, and Hera Syndula. The printing on this part perfectly captures the appearance of her lekku, with simple, dark brown designwork. The torso features her form fitting top, with one sleeve, depicted by the dark brown left arm. Her right arm is molded in dark azure. Her legs have simple printing on the hips and thights to depict her belt and sash. Aayla carries a blue lightsaber.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second minifigure is a Clone Trooper Gunner, now featured in the phase two armor. The design is based on the standard Clone Trooper armor, but with extra amor added to the chest and forehead. The legs and head are standard to LEGO&#39;s Clone Trooper minifigures, using the angry clone head that is the go-to for all helmeted troopers in Star Wars sets now. He carries a blaster rifle, with a technic stud pin attached to the barrel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It seems unlikely at this point that LEGO will update their Battle Droid design in the future, given that this year marks 10 years of its use. While a little more detail in the design would be nice, I do not think there is much that can be improved. It is a very simple design, and captured the flimsy-ness of the B-1 Battle droids very well.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>The set is divided into two bags of parts, and contains two instruction manuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first bag, and corresponding instruction manual comprise of the Clone Trooper Gunner, and the lower half of the tank. The frame is built from many layers of plates, stacked and overlapped for stability. A few stickers add detail to the structure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second bag contains the droids, Aayla, and the cabin and final detailing of the tank. This part of the build is much more vertical, and feels a but cramped when working on the cabin structure. The rest of the stickers are applied in this bag.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the build is very stable, and relatively easy, though it can be easy to poorly align the stickers, given that the stickers are completed in one large step at the end of the bag.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Completed Model</h2>

<p>The tank measures about six inches long, and about four in width, and feels very solid. It has a very sleek look to it, especially when compared to set 7679. Two rotating cannons are mounted on either side of the driver&#39;s cabin, each of which has a single stud shooter applied to it to add a simple play function.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My only complaint with the set is how small the driver&#39;s cabin is, and how hard it can be to get the Clone Gunner to sit inside. There is barely any spare space in the cabin once the driver is placed inside, which makes it hard to connect him to the studs on the bottom, which is crucial if you wish to close the canopy over him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sturdiness of the model is fantastic, I&#39;ve dropped it onto a hard floor, and only a few of the small detail elements fell off. The rest of the set just rolled on its four technic wheels.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall Opinion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, the set is definitely worth the $24.99 it sells for in the U.S. It has a great, compact design, and features some rare, nicely detailed minifigures. If you have the 2010 model, this might be a little bit of a toss-up, though this set is much more accurate to the source material than the original. The newer set features significantly less firepower, in comparison, mainly because it lacks the turret mounted in front of the canopy opening.&nbsp;</p>

"vikings","2019-01-06T20:28:28.957Z","Really Good Tank","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>The box is a smaller box that you get with the 25 dollar sets. The dimensions of the box are 26.2 x 19.1 x 6.1 cm and weighs 0.82 lbs. The set comes with two instructions. Both are fairly thin. I don&#39;t know why they gave this set two instruction manuals because it didn&#39;t need it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with some great parts. You get two fencing swords and a silver wrench. On the cannons you get the stud shooter on each side and also the black part of the cannon are really nice pieces to get as well. The total piece count is 305.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>In this set you get four minifigures: Battle Droid x2, Clone Gunner, and Aayla&nbsp;Secura. The Battle Droids are still the same ones you get and each have a blaster. The Clone Gunner is my favorite. I prefer the Phase II Clone armor over the Phase I Clone armor. The Clone Gunner also has a rifle. Aayla&nbsp;Secura is a great figure to get in this set. The printing on her is spot on accurate to the movies and tv show.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The build was really simple and easy. It took me under 20 minutes to build it. There are six stickers in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This is a good set. The tank is a great vehicle to get. The cannons are my favorite part of it. They can rotate 180 degrees. The cockpit of the tank is way to small. It is some what difficult&nbsp;to get the Clone Gunner in and out of the tank.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is also a small storage container in the back of the tank where you store the extra red studs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great set. The tank (with the exception of the cockpit) is really good. The storage in the back, the cannons. All the figures are great. The printing on the Clone Gunner and Aayla&nbsp;Secura&nbsp;is great. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"jakeypoos87","2017-09-24T19:30:33.207Z","REPUBLIC FIGHTER TANK!!!","<p>The republic fighter tank set includes 4 mini figures, 305 parts and retails for &pound;20 in the UK.</p>

<p>I think that this set is really cool with its two side stud shooter cannons, cockpit interior and wheels on the bottom to make it roll. The mini figures included are the exclusive Aayla secura&nbsp;and clone gunner and also has two battle droids.</p>

<p>Overall this set is worth the money and I would defiantly recommend getting this set if you are a fan of the clone wars, for it great value and build.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-05-19T12:07:32.137Z","Nice tank, with two nice minifigs","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I liked the general look of this tank (shape and colours), and having built it, it did not disappoint. The build itself is quite easy, though IMHO never boring, despite the amount of plate stacking done to create a stable platform for the rest of the build. The few stickers are easy to apply, and certainly add to its looks.There are four minifigures, of which the Clone Trooper Gunner and Aayla Secura are unique to this set, and very nice. The set has nice play value, and looks nice enough for display (or be the center piece of a small diorama). Overall, IMHO&nbsp;this set is a good value for money.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>There are two bags, one for the base of the vehicle, and another for the superstructure. The build is easy, but overall quite enjoyable. The designer has done a good job of having you switch the build around - mostly alternating building up the bottom and top - avoiding monotony. There are a few bright off-colour bricks that are nicely bricked in during the build. The stickers are easy to apply, though one has to take care, as them being off will be very visible. Overall, it took me about 45 minutes at a leisurely pace to build the tank. Personally, I think that an 8 year old, and even younger should have little difficulty in putting the set together.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are four minifigures in this set: two identical droids, a Clone Trooper Gunner and Aayla&nbsp;Secura. The droids are very common (found in 23 sets). The Clone Trooper Gunner serves as tank driver (and gunner). He is also armed with a gun. When the Gunner is inside the tank, the gun can be clipped to one of the clips over the right sponson (on the outside). The print on the torso is very nice, front and back. The helmet also has a very nice print, on the front half. There is also a very nice print on the legs. The face print - as to be expected - is that of the angry clone.</p>

<p>Aayla&nbsp;Secura&nbsp;is IMHO the most attractive minfig, and to me part of the appeal of this set. She has a nice print on the front and back of the torso - with a subtle pattern printed on a dark brown background.&nbsp;There is also an IMHO excellent subtle print on the leg. The head-piece is hard plastic, and the print overall looks good, though some of the windings on the blue &#39;tails&#39; are slightly off. She has two face prints, neutral/determined and angry/aggressive. The alternate print is barely covered by the head cover.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Overll, the fighter tank looks very good. A nice &#39;aggressive&#39; look, a nice colour scheme (white and claret), with the stickers very affective in breaking up any monotony and make the surfaces interesting. Sleek and powerful, and the wheel-hubs that are underneath IMHO provide it with just the right height to give the impression of the tank hovering above the surface. Arguably even more effective than the transparent &#39;disks&#39; in the Hover Tank.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>IMHO this is more of a play than display set. The minifigs, droids, and the play-features of the tank itself (stud-shooters, storage in the rear) IMHO make sure of that. It moves around nicely on a hard flat surface, and OK on short carpets with a flat surface. That said, putting in (and getting out) the Clone Trooper is a bit tricky. The vehicle is striking enough to serve as a display piece, though it is fairly small. It could also be used as a center piece of a small diorama of vignette.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, IMHO,&nbsp;this is a good set. A nice build, for a reasonable price, with two excellent minifigures. Is it a &#39;must buy&#39;? IMHO, it is not. But if you like Star Wars, or simply like the looks of it, I would say there is little to hold you back.&nbsp;</p>

"TeddytheSpoon","2020-12-29T13:41:08.393Z","Retro Review: Republic Fighter Tank holds its own","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><i>Having spent most of 2020 indoors, I have spent an awful lot of time re-arranging, re-discovering and re-building older LEGO sets that have otherwise been untouched for a while. These &lsquo;Retro Reviews&rsquo; look back at some of these, and judge whether history has been kind to them&hellip;</i></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The build: </b>nothing spectacular. The set comprises a shade over 300 pieces, and the build consists primarily of bricks-on-wedges-on-plates. There is nothing in the way of truly interesting techniques, but the small size of the set prevents it from becoming a drag; that said, build techniques have not moved on so much that any part of the model could be drastically improved. Dark red and lime green pieces add some interest as a parts pack among the whites and greys that are so popular in Star Wars sets. <b>6/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The figures: </b>#75182 includes four figures, two of which are exclusive to this set (and to this day have remained so). Aayla Secura makes only her second appearance as a minifigure, sporting the same headpiece as the 2010 version that came with #8098 Clone Turbo Tank. This newer figure is nonetheless a welcome update, not least as it does away with the caricaturised Clone Wars look. Fighting alongside her is a Clone Trooper Gunner; although a handful of these troopers have appeared in their phase 1 armour, this if the first (and to date, only) time one has appeared with the upgraded phase 2 armour. As with Aayla, it looks terrific and is a sensible inclusion with the tank. The final two figures are battle droids to oppose the two exclusive figures, and they are just fine. <b>9/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Play value: </b>the Republic Fighter Tank is mounted atop a set of wheels, which allow the easy pushing-around of the vehicle while simultaneously giving it a hovering illusion (as long as you don&rsquo;t look underneath it); they are effective enough, but thick carpet is enough to render them ineffective. Two stud-shooters are tacked onto the pair of side-mounted cannons, and again are effective enough. The only slight annoyance is that the presence of clips to mount a wrench and the clone trooper&rsquo;s weapon to prevent them from pointing downwards, which if you plan on hitting the included droids, is a necessity. The aforementioned wrench and storage at the rear of the tank introduce another, more peaceful dynamic &ndash; which is a good job, as although the inclusion of battle droids is wise, it&rsquo;s hard to see them putting up much of a fight against a jedi and a tank. <b>6/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Model value: </b>the TX-130 Saber-class fighter tank has appeared previously in LEGO form, with the popular #7679 forming part of the first year of Clone Wars sets. This early version had nearly twice as many pieces as the 2017 model, and consequently is a more imposing model. Some regard #7679&nbsp;as the superior version of the tank; however, it&rsquo;s hard to argue that the newer model is far more accurate. The sleeker looks that befit a light, quick-strike tank are well-represented in #75182, with better proportions than its bulky predecessor. In this case, less is most certainly more. <b>9/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Overall verdict: </b>when this set was released in 2017, it represented excellent value at just &pound;20. As I write this, a used set &ndash; albeit complete with minifigures and instructions &ndash; will set you back around &pound;35. This is still pretty decent value for a set with two excellent, exclusive minifigures, in only the second representation of its source material (and especially compared to its older sibling, which will set you back at least &pound;80). For collectors looking to build a Grand Army of the Republic, this charming little tank still represents a good investment today. <b>7/10</b></p>
