"RaffeToffe","2017-06-02T15:04:30.98Z","Darth Vader Transformation, a set I've been waiting for 12 years.","<p>This set has a lot of emotional value for me, because my brother bought the set in 2005. I liked the set very much, because it was a cheap way to get Darth Vader. Finally when I went to the store with my parents to get the set, it was already out of stores and I was devastated. Finally a couple months ago I saw that this was coming on the 1st of June. I bought it as soon as I could. Came back home and built it.</p>

<p>I was oddly satisfied how fun it was to build the set, even though the circle is very repetitive.</p>

<p>MINIFIGURES:</p>

<p>DARTH VADER is the the best minifigure&nbsp;in this set. The printing is great but the helmet is awesome. It&#39;s so much more realistic than the previous version. I have no cons with Darth Vader.</p>

<p>EMPEROR PALPATINE&nbsp;has very simplistic but good printing. The head is really good and I like that he has a double-sided face. One with a neutral look and the other with a menacing look.</p>

<p>ANAKIN SKYWALKER (DARTH VADER) has the same face as darth vader but I noticed that his face has darker printing than Vaders. The torso printing is really good but the color is a bit off. The legs have the same color problem but are printed really well.</p>

<p>THE DROIDS are very well made. They fill in the gaps of the set and are what makes this set even better than if they left them out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE SET has very cool mechanics on how to turn Vader around and how to put his mask on. Building the set was fun and I really enjoy this set. The only complaint I have is that they used white pieces for the floor and don&#39;t look that great. Other wise a great set.</p>

<p>PROS:</p>

<p>- Excellent minifigures</p>

<p>-Fun to build</p>

<p>-Great play-features</p>

<p>-Catches the scene very well</p>

<p>-Good mechanichs&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Great value for the price</p>

<p>CONS:</p>

<p>-The white pieces are a bit off but not a really big problem</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>RATING: 9.5/10</p>

First one since 2006!","<p>So it&#39;s a good set (since they have had 11 years designing it) the technic functions are amazing in this set along with the playability the base gets kind of repetitive but after that it stops. It&#39;s only like 15-30 min build fairly fast build for 282 pieces. It comes with to medical droids and some tools and &nbsp;Palpatine and Darth Vader with a damaged Anakin so minifigure selection is decent. I would recommend buying this set it is definitely worth the money and the time building it.</p>

"vikings","2020-04-05T22:22:19.01Z","Great Remake!","<p>This is a great remake of the one from 2006. I knew I had to have this the second I saw. The price for this is very reasonable at $25 USD.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a small thin box. The dimensions of the box are 10.3 x 7.5 x 2.4 inches and weighs 0.8 pounds. The box has a normal size instruction for a $25 USD set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You get some cool pieces in this set. You get tool of chrome tools for the FX-Series medical assistant droid, which is really cool. You get a couple trans orange pieces for a couple of the droids. You also get a clear ring for on DD-13 medical assistant droid. You also get a couple cool technic parts that aren&#39;t overly common as well. The total piece count for the set is 282.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Emperor Palpatine:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Emperor Palpatine is a great figure to get in this set. He has a doubled sided face, each with amazing detail on them. One side is a neutral expression and the other is an angry expression. He has a black hood and black soft cape (Which I like a lot more than the hard capes). He has nice detail on his torso and legs of his robes. He comes with a gold lightsaber hilt and red blade.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Darth Vader:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Darth Vader is nicely done. His helmet is now two pieces which is nice. He also comes with a soft cape. He has the same head as burned Vader. I really like that they gave him this head as it is right after his transformation instead of giving him his normal white head.The detail on his torso and legs is really good. He comes with his traditional silver lightsaber hilt with red blade.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Vader Burned:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This figure is really nice to add to anyones Star Wars collection. The detail on him is outstanding. The detail on his head with all the burn marks and scars is great. The printing on his torso and legs is also very well done. Showing his tattered&nbsp;robes from being burned is just great. My only complaint is that he doesn&#39;t have his yellow Sith eyes like Palpatine. Other than that he is a great figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>DD-13 Medical Assistant Droid:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This is an okay figure. It looks really cool, but it is not overly sturdy. A clear ring connects black battle droid legs to it and it isn&#39;t very sturdy. It tends lean and the legs come off easy. Other than that it looks really good. It has a third arm to balance it on the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>FX-Series Medical Assistant Droid:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This medical droid is great. It holds up to 6 different tools and can rotate 360 degrees. It has a trans orange piece in the middle looks really good. This is a really nice droid&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Prowler 1000 Exploration Droid:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Resembles a probe droid. It is really cool and nice droid to get in this set. Comes with a clear pole.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The build wasn&#39;t difficult. The technique on the stand where you put Darth Vader and burned Vader is really cool in the being able to have lean back and stand vertically straight up.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is an amazing set. All the minifigures and droids are well done and complement the set very well. These are great figures to get in a set as cheap as this. The build is great and really captures this iconic scene. I highly recommend getting this set to add to your Star Wars collection. Overall I&#39;m giving this a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-04-25T18:12:24.79Z","Three droids, two Vaders and one emperor","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>For a while I likes this set, and had in mind to get it if I had some money to burn. I liked the scene in the movie, and was really interested what Lego would make of it. Overall, I am not disappointed and like the set. To me it offers decent value for money, with three interesting minifigs, nice play options, all while still being rather compact. It offers quite good value for money, even at RRP. The &#39;put-the-helmet-on-Vader-mechanism&#39; works surprisingly well.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>There is nothing too special with the build but it was not boring either. It was an easy build that took me about 45-50 minutes at a leisurely pace. Building the base was rather monotonous, though it was nice to see how they broke up a 4x build in a 2x 2x build. There are no truly special techniques used, IMHO, although it is interesting to see how the designer managed to make the various play elements line up properly (he did a very good job there). I liked the build of the FX Medical assistant droid. The technique&nbsp;to make the Prowler 1000 Exploration Droid appear to be floating is simple but effective.</p>

<p>Due to the nature of the design, there are many identical pieces included in this set.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are three actual minifigures - Emperor Palpatine, Darth Vader pre-transformation / severely wounded Anakin, and Darth Vader post-transformation. The three droids are listed as minifigures, but personally I do not consider them as such.</p>

<p>Emperor Palpatine is a nice figure, with a nice print on the front of the torso, which is continued on the legs. He does not have a print on the back, which is no problem, as he wears a soft-cloth cape. There are two face prints, one with him being miffed, and one being outraged. IMHO they are very good. His Jedi light-sabre comes with a gold hilt.</p>

<p>Anakin&nbsp;is IMHO the best minifigure in this set. The print on his torso (front and back) and legs is awesome. The front torso print is continued nicely on his legs. He has only a single face print (as the back of his head shows his injuries. The print does a very nice job of showing off a severely injured Anakin&nbsp;actually was.</p>

<p>Darth Vader is a good figure as well. A good print on the torso, continued on the legs. Just as Palpatine, he has no print on his back, and a soft cloth cape. His helmet is a two piece helmet. He has the same head as Anakin, which is logical. This Darth Vader is not unique, as it is also found in the Darth Vader pod.</p>

<h2>The builds</h2>

<p>The three droids -&nbsp;the Prowler 1000 Exploration Droid, the&nbsp;FX-Series Medical Assistant Droid, and a medical droid - are nice builds. The are also IMHO a nice representation of the droids as seen in the movie.</p>

<p>The build of the operating chamber is an ok build. It does the job nicely, and the designer has done a good job IMHO with the colour scheme, hiding off-colours, and limiting the exposure of technic pieces - all while keeping the parts count down. The transformation mechanism - similar to the &#39;Bruce-Wayne-becomes-Batman&#39;-mechanism in the Batcave break-in - workd surprisingly well, even though technically more advanced. There are two simple mechanisms that allow you to &#39;destroy&#39; the operating room.</p>

<p>IMHO the designer has done a nice job to design a &#39;complete&#39; set with a limited parts count for a limited budget. It is worth noting you also get a complete set of tools (drill, hammer, wrenches, oil-can etc), something I have only seen in Ninjago set &#39;Final&nbsp;flight of Destiny&#39;s Bounty&#39; (set 70738, from 2015).</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This is above all a play set, and I think it does the job very well. The transformation mechanism, the mechanism to&nbsp;put on the helmet, the droids, Palpatine and Anakin/Vader, the ability to &#39;destroy&#39; the rooms... enough opportunities for play.</p>

<p>As a display set this simply falls short; that said, IMHO it can be integrated easily in a much larger display.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall this set did not disappoint at all. The build was ok - a nice way to spend most of an hour. I like the minifigures, of which Anakin and Palpatine are unique. The droid builds are fun as well. The play features of this set are excellent. IMHO this is a set well worth its price, whether you are a collector of Star Wars sets or not.</p>

"dRevan","2017-12-14T16:13:27.573Z","Darth Vader's Transformation","<p>Darth Vader&rsquo;s Transformation is one of the many sets released in the Summer 2017 wave. It retails for a surprising $29.99, has 282 pieces and three minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong>:<br />
1. Darth Vader: This figure is identical to the 2016&rsquo;s Death Star set. The figure has the new two-piece helmet mold which is very accurate. The face underneath is Anakin&rsquo;s burned face after his duel on Mustafar. This version is when Darth Vader recently becomes a Sith lord so the face is very fitting. The cape is the soft, spongy material. The torso is very detailed but features no back printing which is a shame. The torso and legs are identical to 2014&rsquo;s Imperial Star Destroyer. Darth Vader comes with the trademark red lightsaber.<br />
2. Darth Sidious/Emperor Palpatine: Like Vader, this figure is identical to 2016&rsquo;s Death Star set. The face is very accurate in the tan colour scheme and features a serious side and a grinning side which looks very malevolent. The torso and legs detailing is simple but effective with simple robe and hood detailing. Emperor Palpatine comes with a red lightsaber with a gold hilt.<br />
3. Burned Anakin Skywalker: This figure is unique to this set and builds on the previous two versions. The face features a neutral expression but has many cuts on the front and back. The torso displays his ripped robes exposing his body which has many cuts and gashes. The left arm is flesh while the right arm is black exposing even more damage that Anakin took. The legs are done in pearl silver which looks marvelous and have more ripped robes detailing as well as minor cuts and gashes exposed here and there.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Build</strong>:<br />
The build features the area where Darth Vader was created. It uses numerous A plates to create an octagonal platform which looks good. White 2x2 wing plates are used to represent bursts of light as well as 1x1 translucent white studs. On two opposite platforms are 2x2 jumper plates used to hold the droid and a lightsaber rack.&nbsp;<br />
The droid is very accurately build using a technic wheel in red as the eye. The centre has an octagonal plate with clips on all sides to hold many different accessories including a blood bottle. The shape and height of the droid has been captured successfully.<br />
The opposite side contains a rack to hold Vader&rsquo;s and Palpatine&rsquo;s lightsabers. Also, there is a spot to hold another droid. This droid is attached to a translucent rod showing that its hovering in place. Both things can be popped off using a technic mechanism underneath.&nbsp;<br />
One side of the platform has a small technic assembly to hold Vader&rsquo;s helmet. There are two rubber technic pieces used to hold the helmet between them and then the entire assembly can be pushed forward to attach the helmet on Vader. This trick was employed in Palpatine&rsquo;s Shuttle and is nicely integrated once again.&nbsp;<br />
The other side is where the Transformation occurs. There is small technic frame build like the one in Carbon-Freezing Chamber from last year. The mechanism has a small knob at the front where when you twist it, will change Anakin into Vader. It works well and is very fun to play with.&nbsp;<br />
Another feature is a small droid. This one was unique in the movie because it had three legs. The droid has been very accurately rendered into Lego form. It uses a new colour for the stud in pearl dark grey which I like a lot. The build is simple but very effective.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Overall</strong>:<br />
This set is fantastic! The play features work well, make sense and are very fun to play with. The figures are high desirable especially Vader and Palpatine who have not featured in a cheap set for over a decade. The price-to-piece ratio is very good as well with 282 parts! Buy this set at full price and you will not regret it. At a sale, it&rsquo;s even better!</p>

"Tre1awny","2021-02-05T22:28:44.997Z","Nooooooooooooooooooooooo!","<p>Despite the title this will be a pretty positive review I just couldn&#39;t resist putting everyone&#39;s favourite scene as the title.This 2017 set was one of the smaller ones and likely overshadowed by the rogue one wave, however I received it for Christmas 2017 along with #75156 Krennic&#39;s shuttle.</p>

<p>The build: The build is fairly repetitive courtesy to the layout which uses eight &quot;A&quot; frame pieces with small platforms built onto them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs: you get three in this set including Darth Sidious/Emperor Palpatine, Darth Vader and last but not least a horrifically scarred Anakin Skywalker. Palps is a nice inclusion along with the Darth Vader only previously appearing in #75159 Death Star and #75093 final duel. Scarred Anakin is a suitable inclusion for the set and is screen accurate. I&#39;m just surprised they included him I mean think about it, in the film this man has been burnt to a crisp and is controlled by hate but I mean y&#39;know, it&#39;s just a toy. Also included are their respective lightsabers</p>

<p>Play/display: this set boasts an impressive array of features. Let&#39;s start with the medical bed/platform essentially what you do is put the Anakin figure on one side and Darth Vader on the other rotate it around and now poor Anakin has been turned everyone&#39;s favourite baddie Darth Vader. Next up is the ability to put on Darth&#39;s iconic helmet just like in the film, this works surprisingly well. Lastly you are able to flip off the probe droid and medical droid on the sides of the platforms thanks to some levers recreating Vader&#39;s rage scene in Revenge of the sith. As for display good luck finding somewhere where this fits in I&#39;ve currently got it next to Krennic&#39;s shuttle and #75091 flash speeder.</p>

<p>Summary: this is an excellent playset, but I have to say the figures really are the main draw here especially this being the cheapest way at the time (and still today in 2021) to get the modern versions of Vader and papa Palps.</p>

Although his helmet angles upwards slightly (unlike in the movie) it otherwise looks very accurate and imposing. Instead of his usual expression, he has a face print that shows his recently burnt face. He wears the newer style of cloak which flows realistically. His torso looks great as well with a detailed print showing his armour, belt, and robes. The print continues down his legs. He comes with his red lightsaber.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

He has the same head as the fully armoured Vader, which is appropriate as his head would look the same with or without the mask. His torso print shows a burnt robe on the front and back with patches of skin showing. Unfortunately, the flesh coloured print on the black torso isn&rsquo;t thick enough so it looks too light. His legs are silver which represents his cybernetic limbs but with a print showing flesh and tattered robes on his upper legs. This print however doesn&rsquo;t continue around the sides and cuts off abruptly when you view the figure from his side or back, a problem that could have been fixed with dual moulded legs (upper half moulded in flesh or black for his robes, and the lower half being silver for his cybernetic legs). He comes with no accessories.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

His two face prints are great, the first showing wrinkled yellowish skin, yellow eyes, and a cunning expression. The other expression is equally good with his teeth bared angrily. His torso is less detailed than Vader&rsquo;s and shows a simple robe print which continues onto his legs. He carries his gold hilted red lightsaber.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The head is built using two medium sized dish pieces facing each other. An orange technic piece represents the eye. The droid has six arms (as it does in the movie) each holding a silver tool that can be used by the different medical droids. These tools include; a drill, a small hammer, an oil can, a chisel, five wrenches including, a lug wrench, an adjustable wrench, and a ratchet wrench. While some of these tools would be useful for fitting a mechanical suit on Vader, some of them certainly wouldn&rsquo;t be, but I think they work well enough. The droid&#39;s body is slightly curved and has two vials of red and yellow liquid attached to it.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

In the movie, the droid has 3 legs equally distanced apart. Here however it uses standard battle droid legs and has an extra leg on the back which looks strange. The battle droid legs aren&#39;t attached securely to the body so they break off easily. His body looks fine with a light in the centre of his chest but his arms are also wrong. In the movie they stick out forwards and the &ldquo;hands&rdquo; are angled downwards, here however the droid also has battle droid arms and the tools are grasped upwards. If you attach the tools upside down it looks more accurate but still a bit off. The head looks the worst. It uses an orange stud to represent the eyes with a black stud on top to represent the head. The result is disproportionately small compared to the body.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

This certainly isn&rsquo;t movie accurate but I appreciate it nonetheless. The probe droid is built with small radar dishes as the main body and has lights and a small antenna as detail.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The set&#39;s final action feature (and my favourite) lets you pose Vader (suited up) on the bed without his helmet; attach his helmet to a device at the head of the bed, and then use the device to push his helmet onto his head.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

"RaiderOfTheLostBrick","2020-04-20T00:16:31.013Z","Rise Lord Vader","<p>The Rise of Darth Vader is among one of the most iconic and penultimate scenes from the Star Wars saga. This set, released in 2017, is one of two that LEGO has released (three of you count Emperor Palpatine&rsquo;s Shuttle).</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>The set comes with three minifigures (as well as a few brick built droids).</p>

<p>Darth Vader is one of the most iconic villains in all of cinema. This figure is based on the 2015 remoulding, which isn&rsquo;t really too bad. The figure captures the look of the character just fine. Underneath the helmet, you can see the burnt head of Anakin Skywalker. It&rsquo;s pretty gruesome, but still a cool part. I also believe this is one of the cheapest ways to get him.</p>

<p>Emperor Palpatine is also among cinema&rsquo;s finest villains. Like Vader, he is based off his 2015 design, which looks even more menacing then ever. This is also an affordable way to get the character.</p>

<p>Burnt Anakin is also includedand is the only exclusive figure of the set. Some silver parts are included on the figure, which presumably represents his missing limbs. The printing on him might be too gruesome for some, but it&rsquo;s still not a bad figure at all. In fact, he&rsquo;s probably the most detailed of the three.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>Two brick built droids are included: an Fx-7 Medical Droid and another one similar to 2-1B. Fx-7 looks fine enough, however the other, while it does have some detail and interesting use of parts, isn&rsquo;t really that great. I would have preferred a 2-1B mold. Another Medical&nbsp;Droid is included, and can be attached to a&nbsp;lightsaber rack so it looks like it&rsquo;s floating.</p>

<p>The main build is based on the Coruscant medical centre. While it seems accurate to the film, the dark colouring might not be the most appealing aspect of the set. One cool part of the design is the octagonal shape, which ultimately redeems it from the muted colours, but is quite repetitive when building. A square design would definitely turn away many fans.</p>

<p>Several play features are also in the set, mostly referring to the creation of Darth Vader. The table in the centre can be rotated and fit both Anakin and Vader on either side. Behind it, a rack holds Vader&rsquo;s helmet which can lower it onto Vader&rsquo;s head. &nbsp;After that, the table can be pushed upright and then the infamous &lsquo;NO&rsquo; scene can be recreated with some exploding parts. Interestingly, I&rsquo;d say that these play features do make up for the lackluster and&nbsp;unappealing design.</p>

<p><strong>Other:</strong></p>

<p>The price of this set was $45 AUD. For&nbsp;234 pieces, this isn&rsquo;t a bad deal. However, like many Star Wars sets, it could be much better, especially given the unappealing build.</p>

<p>Also, though they are featured in the main image, there aren&rsquo;t any minifigure stands included. Odd.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict:</strong></p>

<p>Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine are among the most iconic characters in film history. Being the cheapest way to get them, it seems likely that many Star Wars fans on a budget would take great interest with this set. The Burnt&nbsp;Anakin is also a highly detailed figure and worth a spot in the collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite this, the general structure of the build is generally unappealing due to its muted colours. While this is accurate to the film, it won&rsquo;t interest many kids and collectors. The decent&nbsp;play features however, do make up for this. The set might also be somewhat overpriced for what you get, but it could still be worse.</p>

<p>So overall, this isn&rsquo;t a bad Star Wars set and I highly recommend it for Star Wars fans. May the Force be with you.</p>
