<p>Hello lego&nbsp;star wars fans! In just four days, it&#39;s christmas, and i thought i would use this oppurtunity to express my thoughts on this set. These reviews are in a huge grade individual, so please note before leaving a dislike. Thanks, enjoy the review!</p>

<p>In the past seven years lego started making star wars calendars, they have developed alot since 2011, and the question is, has they gotten worse or better? I generally think it depends on the calendar for each year. This one is of the not so good&nbsp;ones, if you ask me! That&#39;s essentially due to the very random selection of minifigures and micro-builds. But it&#39;s not a bad calendar!</p>

<h3>Minifigures:</h3>

<p>The minifigures&nbsp;we get is: Sabrine Wren, Santa-BB8, Unkars thug, First order snowtrooper, first order, stormtrooper, imperial officer, and a first order pilot of some kind. The selection is not bad, but if we look back at last years calendar, we got Luke Skywalker, Santa Chewbacca, Bepsin Guard, and many other figures. What i want to state here, is that, the selection is very random. Sabrine&nbsp;Wren is from Rebels, Unkars&nbsp;Thug from TFA. And other figures from different universes. Some people might appreciate this, but i think they shouldn&#39;t have done it. For adult and teen collectors it can be hard to make a setting og a scene from the selection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rest of the figures are also quite nice, but quite common, and that is a minus. I wish they could of made something else than just a BB8 with a Santa hat. There are none excluseive figures here!!</p>

<h3>Micro-Builds:</h3>

<p>The microbuild selection we get here varietes&nbsp;from spaceshuttles, to luggabeasts! I love the little snowblower and of course the Luggabeast. Both of them are different from something we have seen in calendars before. Thats&nbsp;great! Im not going to talk specific about everything else, but the selection of microbuilds is great! Just wish they could have made Krennic&#39;s shuttle a bit more&nbsp;<em>smoother.&nbsp;</em></p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>Im not going to complain about the parts here. I like when lego experiments with different uce of pieces, as they have done here! Like using the goldbar&nbsp;piece in two of the microbuilds, just in another color! Great! The PPP (price per part) value is not the best one, neither the worst!&nbsp;</p>

<h3>General Opinion:</h3>

<p>In total im quite happy with the set. As you&#39;ve read there are something i wish could of been better, like the minifigure selection and other small details. We have gotten worser calendars than this, but compared to the last two years calendars, its not&nbsp;<em>that&nbsp;</em>great. It&#39;s faaaar better than this years city calendar!</p>

<p>Overall: 7/10.&nbsp;</p>
