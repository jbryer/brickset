Then, while completing all the Freemaker&nbsp;Adventures SWL sets, I finally purchased 75185&nbsp;in a damaged box. The minifigs were must have for my collection. Finally, I began the build and was I&nbsp;surprised. This is one of the most completely unique SWL sets I&rsquo;ve built to date. Also, very sturdy ( I assumed it would be somewhat flimsy). I took my time carefully assembling the Tracker-I and even though most sections were 3x, it was entertaining and fun to build. I almost want to disassemble and build it again, but I&rsquo;ll wait a while.</p>
