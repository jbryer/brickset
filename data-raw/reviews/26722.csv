"Ferus_Olin","2017-09-12T05:01:08.397Z","Surprising Value","<p><b>Introduction:&nbsp;</b>I bought this set two days after it was released, because it looked to be the most interestingof the wave. As with the other Last Jedi sets, the price tag was difficult to get around. Was it worth it? Read on and find out.</p>

<p><strong>Box and Contents</strong></p>

<p>The box is the same as the other sets of the wave, with Rey, Finn, and Poe Dameron pictured in the corner. I rather like the design, though it looks more like an action figure box. As usual, the set functions are displayed on the back, which represent it well. A sticker sheet and the instruction manual are in a sealed bag, and mine were in perfect condition.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Nothing interesting here. Grey. What more can I say?</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Minifigures are always a highlight, but the entire wave is rather disapointing on that account. However, their quality is impressive.</p>

<p>First Order Stormtrooper and Sergeant: Great army builders, and the sergeant includes a rare white pauldron. A second normal Stormtrooper would have been welcome.</p>

<p>First Order Shuttle Pilot: He shares a torso with the First Order Crew, but his helmet is unique. He makes for an excellent bridge crew member.</p>

<p>First Order Officer: A darker suited version of his Force Awakens counterparts, he adds variety to their ranks.</p>

<p>BB-9E: Without having seen the movie, he means very little, though he is a delightful little droid. Not unique, but a nice addition.</p>

<p>Supreme Leader Snoke: A very detailed and great looking minifigure. It&#39;s great to finally get the elusive character, and he is easily amongst my favourites from the Sequel Trilogy</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The build was (predictably) a tad repetitive, but it is an interesting model to see come together. The stickers were all quite easy to apply and add some needed breaks in the set&#39;s bland colour scheme. Not a difficult build by any means.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>The completed model is fantastic and surprisingly large, nearly matching 2015&#39;s Millennium Falcon. The small number of figures is rather disappointing, but the highly detailed final model makes up for it. I would highly recommend it at a discount (as full price is a bit much)&nbsp;, especially if you have many officers and crew members already, as their addition enhances&nbsp;it immensely. A solid 4.5/5 stars</p>

"andyh1984","2017-10-27T16:56:15.443Z","A lot nicer and more detailed than it looks in pictures.","<p>&nbsp;I took the opportunity to get a Star Destroyer really just to compliment my TFA Falcon and Tie fighter but like most AFOLs I couldn&#39;t afford an Imperial one on the secondary market, and I wasn&#39;t expecting to enjoy the building of this set or the finished product as much as I do.</p>

<p>While the side panels are basically the same build but opposite, the structure and interior are a really interesting build, the building of Snokes throne and intergrated handle are a masterpiece in themselves and all the crew pits and surrounds are great and quite intricate. The colour scheme is limited but that is to be expected even those hull panels take more building than they would look too because of the multi layered aspect and all the surface texturing, my only gripe is the fixed stud shooters but I think to make them move in any way would impact on the interior of the hull plate and therefore reduce space for placing Minifigures so it is a worthy compromise in my opinion.</p>

<p>The Minifigures are good but I would have preferred one of Snokes red guards rather than one of the stormtroopers but the exclusive Snoke is a nice Minifigure and the colouring for the officer makes him stand out.</p>

<p>Overall I would recommend this set as a high point in an otherwise lacklustre TLJ line of sets.</p>

"CC_2224","2017-12-29T03:39:25.97Z","A Fantastic Model and one of the Most Impressive Sequel Trilogy Sets to Date","<p>The First Order Star Destroyer is a highly detailed, accurate, and durable model as a part of the first wave of Star Wars The Last Jedi sets. It is camera friendly from all angles with expert detail applied to&nbsp;the top faces as well as the back of the ship. Both &#39;flaps&#39; come together as best as possible, and the handle used to &#39;fly&#39; the vessel is perfectly placed. The interior is given high attention to detail with movie-accurate architecture. The inside also reveals the solid Technic skeleton for the handle, but also many stickers, that may be hard and frustrating for some younger fans. The only standout flaw of this craft is the top-most flap that sometimes detatches completely from the Star Destroyer.</p>

<p>The building experience was surprisingly engaging and fun, which is not always expected from a set with over 1000 pieces that is symmetrical (Usually is repetitive). This is achieved by Lego through separating the &#39;flaps&#39;&nbsp;into three segments each, so when one completes a side, they start with a pattern that was only done three bags previous</p>

<p>Lego goes &#39;all-out&#39; with their selection of parts for this set. They use appropriate parts throughout the build, and less common parts to enhance the legitimacy and &#39;texture&#39; of the craft. However, there are plenty of stickers in the set&nbsp;which can be difficult to apply, and experience problems over time.</p>

<p>This set, despite being colossal to some, can be easily played with and &#39;piloted&#39;. The outside has stud shooters which can be shot, and the inside has plenty of &#39;workspace&#39; for the minifigures, as well as a manual elevator that can take a figure&nbsp;to the upper seat.</p>

<p>The minifigures, despite not being movie-accurate to&nbsp;<em>this&nbsp;</em>Star Destroyer are worthy of being in a set of this price point. The First Order Stormtroopers are the standard issue that have been produced since Fall 2015. The white shoulder pauldron on one of the Stormtroopers is something noticable that has been absent since The Force Awakens, and good to be introduced in this set. The new First Order Crew figure with a raised visor is a new mould fitting for a set of this nature. The officer is a greatly improved version of the ones seen in the past, as &#39;gunmetal&#39; is a more accurate color choice. The Droids are well done, but one stud under the Medical Droid would have made it easier to pose and display it. Snoke is a mysterious and&nbsp;popular character, and his desirable and highly detailed minifigure was ideal for a set like this, even though he wasn&#39;t in this Star Destroyer in the film.</p>

<p>The set has an excellent price for a 1400+ piece licensed set. At USD$160, and CAD$180 it has a better value than the Millennium Falcon from Fall 2015, showing a surprising improvement in the price of licensed Lego sets.</p>

<p>If one has the budget for this set, I would strongly recommend it. It is the most appealing and impressive set from The Last Jedi subtheme so far, and it is very iconic to the Star Wars saga, and the latest trilogy.</p>

"Areedman2000","2017-12-22T18:54:27.74Z","F.O. Star Destroyer... All about the interior.","<p>This is my first Lego Star Wars Star destroyer and i have to say that over all, i was pleased with it.&nbsp; The build (as always) was fun and entertaining. Putting Star Wars Lego sets are my version of sitting down with a good book. They get my eyes and attention off of the T.V. for a while and when i am finished I have another thing to add to my display of LSW sets.</p>

<p>My overall rating of 5 out of 5 comes mainly from my pleasure with the interior of this set.&nbsp; The Black and Red scheme is visually pleasing. I was surprised at how much room there was on the inside of this. When closed, it doesn&#39;t look like there would be that much room for play on the interior.&nbsp; That being said... My sets are built and placed on stands for display. I can&#39;t say i actually play with any of them which brings me to my 3 out of 5 playability rating. It&#39;s a neutral score because i couldn&#39;t tell you one way or the other. Back to the over all score. The interior is visually pleasing and offers more room than you&#39;d think. There were a few minor issues of getting the bridge section to connect to the bracket that holds it into place, but i was eventually able to figure it out. Some of the pieces to the interior things (table and chairs, control station, etc. are easily knocked off their intended places, which may be an issue when playing with. But that&#39;s not an issue for me.</p>

<p>The exterior is well detailed, i like the layering effect of the different levels.&nbsp; Pictures do&nbsp;not do it justice. The bridge is detailed well and seems to be proportionate to the rest of the ship. My favorite part is the blue exhaust/engine (I cant think of what you would call these) pieces on the rear of the ship. ***Side note. customizing and adding LED lights to these, take this set to a whole new level of beauty***&nbsp; &nbsp;My only negative to the exterior is the canons on both sides. I&#39;m not a fan of the green studs or the proportionate size of these. However, I know something had to be there and there&#39;s not a whole lot of option there due to the size of the ship. Speaking of the size of the ship...&nbsp; For the $159.00 price tag while still on retail shelves..&nbsp; It could have been a little bit bigger i feel. After all, when you think Star Destroyer, you think some of the largest ships in the Star Wars Galaxy.&nbsp; Right?&nbsp; Looks a little funny next to an Lego X-Wing.</p>

<p>In Summary... The Interior is where it&#39;s at with this set. Love the use of Black and Red color, the little Snoke hologram&nbsp; piece on the bridge, and just the sheer amount of&nbsp; space within the interior. This set is yet another nice looking display piece to my collection.</p>

"Koot","2018-01-02T10:28:43.5Z","LEGO Star Wars 75190 First Order Star Destroyer","<p>We have finally gotten LEGO&#39;s version of the monstrous starship, the <em>Finalizer</em>. This massive model comes with 7&nbsp;minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>The Model:</strong></p>

<p>LEGO have gotten the shape very accurate to the movie and has a lot of nice texture on the outside. On the interior, almost every space has been utilized as a play area. You can put minifigures&nbsp;on the command bridge, on various computers and elevators. These are all really great play features and definitely add a lot to this set.</p>

<p>The inside looks a little messy as the structure of the ship&nbsp;(technic elements) are&nbsp;showing. However, there isn&#39;t much that LEGO could have done, and they have clearly tried to cover that stuff up.</p>

<p>The two large panels on the top of the model and the command bridge can fold out&nbsp;to access the interior. On the outside, there are four stud shooters on either side. Unfortunately, they cannot rotate.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>In this set, we get the exclusive Supreme Leader Snoke, Interrogation Droid (IT-000 Interrogator) and First Order Stormtrooper Officer, and the non-exclusive First Order Stormtrooper, BB-9E, First Order Shuttle Pilot and First Order Officer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Almost all of these minifigures&nbsp;are very collectable (especially Snoke) and I think the minifigures are a big highlight of the set.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>I really love this set, but my only criticism&nbsp;is the price. An $160 USD ($200 AUD) retail price is absolutely huge and I wish this set was $20 cheaper.</p>

<p>Besides the price, I definitely recommend it to anyone.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and I hope this was very helpful.</p>

"RundownPear","2022-03-22T15:28:47.827Z","Great but Suffers From Star Destroyer Syndrome","<p>There isn&#39;t a ton to say about this set.</p>

<p>The exterior is fantastic with some awesome greebling all around. The interior is top-notch with 4 areas all offering something different: Snoke&#39;s chamber which shows the inverse of his holo-talks with Kylo in episode 7 where Kylo is displayed as a small hologram, a conference room similar to what we see in episode 9, a computer terminal area taken from a scene in episode 7, and a well-designed bridge with the ability to seat 4 figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figures are lacking. Snoke, the FO Officer, the FO Shuttle Pilot, BB-9E, a Stormtrooper Commander, and a Stormtrooper aren&#39;t enough for a ship this size. I would have liked to see 2 generic crewmen and maybe another named character to even out this selection. There just aren&#39;t enough figures to fill this in an ideal way. There&#39;s also a random medical droid thrown in with no medical station which I am not a fan of.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a very solid set, stays together extraordinarily well. It looks great, has an amazing interior, and great figures but not enough of them. The lack of figures is common amongst all the modern Star Destroyers and is disappointing to see.&nbsp;This is a solid entry into the Star Destroyer line of sets and I recommend it if you find it for a lower price. &nbsp;</p>
