With a new light bluish soft cape and hair piece, he looks great. His face with a very Lando like smile is also a big plus. I can see many people buying this set just for this fig. Next, we have the A-Wing pilot. Pilots are getting more an more detailed each year and this one is no different. Green uniform with the white life support cords look great and the helmet is also greatly moulded. This set also contains the Rebel Engineer, who is necessary to drive the little support vehicle. This figure is just ok, however it is a nice addition to the set, since we didn&rsquo;t get any ground crew in the 75172 Y-Wing Starfighter.</span></p>

"BlueStation","2017-05-27T20:27:35.737Z","Surprising disappointment.","<p>I&#39;m always on the lookout to add to the Rebellion fleet. The sleek, speedy A-Wing, first glimpsed in Return of the Jedi, has been released many times over the years, with constantly evolving design. I missed out on <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75003-1/A-wing-Starfighter"">75003</a> in 2013 (two years before my return to LEGO collecting) - and that release seemed like a high point for the Rebel ship. Could it possibly be topped?</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75175-1/A-wing-Starfighter"">75175</a> comes in a small, square box with the Rogue One Deathtrooper branding on the box (in line with other releases at this time). The artwork depicts the A-Wing in full flight over Endor, dodging Imperial fire. The back of the box shows the landed ship presumably in the Home One hangar bay, with the pilot and crew at work maintaining the ship and General Lando Calrissian overseeing the preparations.</p>

<p>The blueprint-like layouts of the vehicle and accessories, seen with most of the releases during the Force Awakens timeframe, have gone away which is a shame.</p>

<p>The instructions come in a single book, which is nice, but there is a very large sticker sheet for such a small ship. I think stickers can be great additions when they really enhance the look of a set or achieve something that the set design couldn&#39;t do - I wouldn&#39;t say that&#39;s the case here.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>One of the major design shifts with this craft (which we&#39;ll discuss more later) is the shift to brick-built engines, which has made a need for more slopes, wedges, and angle plates and likely increased the overall piece count a bit. I&#39;m torn on this decision a bit; on the one hand, the increased focus on brick-built solutions has seen brilliant evolution of LEGO design in the last decade (instead of creating a bulky, purpose-built new element, TLG&#39;s teams are solving these problems with existing bricks), but on the other hand, I loved the now <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-93168"">seemingly-retired engine element</a> and I also think it remained a good solution for the A-Wing&#39;s engine&#39;s.</p>

<p>So this set sees more of these slopes, wedges and right angle plates in addition to expected maroon-and-white sloped, curved and angled elements to replicate the sleek A-Wing profile. I am wondering, however, if pearl gray elements should start being introduced on these sets anywhere white is currently being used. I don&#39;t know if the cost is prohibitive, but a continuing problem over the years has been the use of white where ships are light gray or silver. I understand the decision, but it&#39;s now plagued otherwise good sets like <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75094-1/Imperial-Shuttle-Tydirium"">Shuttle Tydirium in 2015</a> or the recently-released <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75144-1/Snowspeeder"">UCS Snowspeeder</a>. It&#39;s also one reason why we&#39;ve never seen the Nubian Royal Starship from Episode I.</p>

<p>One last note on the parts - one of the key part inclusions that solves a problem of previous A-Wing releases is the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-47507"">6x6x2 element</a> which is perfectly proportioned to allow the pilot to be seated while not having to lay back in the craft - all the while not sacrificing the sleek lines of the ship. However, there are other seating problems we will discuss later in the review.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>As soon as I saw this set announced, the minifigures are what made it a must-have for me. Since I missed out on 75003, I didn&#39;t have the A-Wing specific pilot from ROTJ, and more importantly - we have a newly upgraded release of the respectable General himself, our old friend Lando Calrissian!</p>

<p>Three minifigures are included in all, starting with the Rebel maintenance crew member. His khaki uniform is full of printed detail, with equipment hanging off his belt and large pockets on his trousers. These appear to be new designs. He has a matching baseball cap and his head is printed with a neutral expression and a headset for comms. This head has been used in a lot of Star Wars sets, often for Imperial officers.</p>

<p>The A-Wing pilot is packed with detail. The neutral expression is a disappointment, which unfortunately has been expected with the pilots across most Star Wars sets (why has no effort been made to make the Wedge Antilles from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75098-1/Assault-on-Hoth"">75098</a> look like Denis Lawson?). Why wouldn&#39;t they do a secondary expression on this pilot showing panic or yelling, as if the ship is <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RW_hGOFukMQ"">about to crash into the bridge of a Super Star Destroyer?</a></p>

<p>Still, the printed green uniform is outstanding. The uniform is very similar to 75003, with a brighter green. Tubes and straps hang down printed all the way down the legs. One of the tubes is printed on three separate elements - the connection on the torso, the belt, and the leg. It&#39;s an intense level of detail. The helmet, which is a re-used mold, features it&#39;s own unique printed detail and coloring.</p>

<p>Finally, we have the welcome return of the iconic Lando Calrissian. If the Brickset database is accurate, we have seen Lando released just 5 times in 18 years. That&#39;s absolutely ridiculous for a character of his importance in the films. Even stranger is that his Cloud City appearance has been released just once. Seriously - what is the deal?</p>

<p>So while long overdue, the return of Lando this year, for the second time ever in his General Calrissian attire, is an opportunity to upgrade and improve on the design, and this version does not disappoint. His torso is given a brighter orangeish-tan color which seems just about right; the torso detailing, from the shiny rank badge to the cape strap to the collars is all re-done and better than ever; only the strap for the gun holster is missing, though that&#39;s consistent with his appearance in the cockpit of the Falcon during the Battle of Endor. His bright, sand blue cape is done with the softer fabric of recent years (the fabric, as with all of these capes, is too noticeable around the neck, but otherwise is an upgrade). The pants are plain gray which is accurate to the film, however they could have done a dual-mold here to show the large black boots - that&#39;s the only missed opportunity.</p>

<p>His head is completely redone with dual expressions, and they have been done perfectly to honor Billy Dee Williams&#39; portrayal. One side is a full, smirky Calrissian smile, the other is a more neutral expression that still has a little smirk to it. Nothing would be more appropriate. His hair has been upgraded (finally) to the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-21778"">element introduced in late 2015</a> for Finn.</p>

<p>He is armed with standard blaster that has a connector peg on the end of it (which was seen in many Rogue One-related sets) - unless I&#39;m remembering wrong, this is not accurate at all to a blaster Lando would have had in ROTJ.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The first quick assembly is the maintenance vehicle, and it&#39;s in line with recent maintenance craft seen in releases like <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75102-1/Poe-s-X-wing-Fighter"">Poe&#39;s X-Wing</a>. I love the hazard stripes and the amount of detail placed on the crate, with clips, grates and controls. A <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-13793"">welder&#39;s torch</a> is included, which until last year was pretty rare. The ladder to the ship connects to the vehicle nicely, though it comes at an awkward angle to the A-Wing and isn&#39;t very stable on it&#39;s own.</p>

<p>Typically with any vehicle build like the A-Wing you&#39;re going to start at the core of the structure and build outward, but strangely it has you start with one of the sides. This makes for an awkward start as you&#39;re putting the center of the ship together.</p>

<p>The usage of the 6x6x2 element in the bottom of the cockpit ends up helping twofold, with technic connections coming out from either side that help with the stability of the build and adds the front landing gear functionality (in addition to the previously mentioned room for the pilot).</p>

<p>The assembly of the two sides early on shows the well-hidden nature of the missile launchers. As the center structure comes together, two 2x1 inverted roof bricks are placed to show how the missile loading and launching will work once fully assembled. These bricks are very unstable until they&#39;re connected again later. The front fuselage is added with the maroon elements and the start of the many stickers that will be used for this craft - three added already. The stickers here are meant to show the small wedge-like gap at the front of the craft. This was previously attempted by moving back the center elements by one stud in the 2013 version, and I think that solution was slightly better, if less accurate. However, with all the elements available now, I&#39;m surprised another solution couldn&#39;t be found. The sticker doesn&#39;t really make it happen.</p>

<p>The back section of the craft is added by Technic connection - this section will be advertised on the box as &quot;storage&quot; for the pilot&#39;s blaster, but that&#39;s ridiculous - it&#39;s very poorly designed and too open-ended for that purpose. No thought was put into this &quot;feature&quot; at all.</p>

<p>We continue with adding slopes to the sides of the craft, building out the aerodynamic body of the A-Wing. Many more stickers are added in this stage. Before heading to bag 3, we add the tiny Technic assemblies which will rest comfortably in the front fuselage to act as buttons for the missiles (this feature works extremely well).</p>

<p>Landing gear is added using more tiny Technic assemblies. These work well, but the front gear is lower than the back two, which seems intentional and may very well be accurate - but looks odd to me when the vehicle is landed. A small engine assembly, using tiles and slopes, is added to the back center - I did not realize there was a third engine firing back there, but it&#39;s a nice detail.</p>

<p>The back of the cockpit doubles as the top of the &quot;storage&quot; section - it lines up flush with the plates added earlier, but I still am disappointed in this design. Previous versions of the A-Wing have been much more creative in this area, actually allowing crate or equipment storage. The attractive windscreen is added (spared of stickers, surprisingly), and then the engine assemblies begin.</p>

<p>The main purpose of the engine assemblies seems to be to allow the engine with fins to be clipped on so they can be angled slightly inward at the top, which is absolutely more accurate to the film. Previous releases had the top and bottom fins completely vertical and perpendicular to the craft. So I appreciate this attempt at accuracy to the craft, and the assemblies themselves, for being brick-built solutions. Having said that, they are clipped on with just two clips at one connection point. This is inadequate for the structural integrity of the set as well as playability. Attempting to hold the craft or swoosh it, almost immediately resulted in one of the engine assemblies to be jostled, loosened, or knocked off the clip. There are many other solutions that could have been applied here, especially with the engines being brick-built (offering more flexibility on the interior parts usage), that could have allowed for the inwardly-angled fins while keeping a nice, stable overall ship assembly. Finally the side guns are added, which look great in detail but have a habit of spinning all over the place (due to their allowance to pivot up in landing mode), a problem that plagued previous models as well.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>The ship looks good on the whole. It&#39;s unmistakably a Rebellion A-Wing, and the angle of the fins recalls the original design from the films.</p>

<p>When the pilot is seated, the figure can sit up fully, instead of being laid down in the cockpit, smashed into whatever available space was left. This is done without sacrificing the aerodynamics of the underside of the ship. However, there is one major seating problem, which is not unique to this ship - the use of tiles and foot plates instead of stud connections where the figure would be seated. This technique has NEVER WORKED, and yet it&#39;s used continuously - the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75101-1/First-Order-Special-Forces-TIE-Fighter"">First Order Tie Fighter</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75049-1/Snowspeeder"">Snowspeeder</a>, for two recent examples. The figure loosens from it&#39;s seat almost immediately, there is never a snug connection. It&#39;s been a major annoyance in all sets that have included this feature - fortunately it&#39;s an easy fix here if you want to modify, but that&#39;s not always the case with these sets.</p>

<p>The missile shooters are brilliantly hidden and integrated into the underside of the ship, which is a big plus for playability without sacrificing design.</p>

<p>However, the model loses the playable swooshability factor with the fragility of the engine connections, and when displayed in landed mode, is off-kilter due to the landing gear at uneven heights.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>This is an unusual release. It&#39;s a limited retail release in the US, and it comes less than a year after a Rebels-related A-Wing prototype release hit the market. We are very likely to see yet another A-Wing variation soon with the upcoming release of The Last Jedi in December (set photos indicated a Resistance A-Wing in blue colors). So I&#39;m not sure many people were looking for another A-Wing right now.</p>

<p>Obviously there is the appeal of the minifigures, mainly Lando, whose rarity is baffling. The upgraded minifigure designs are excellent, and Lando in particular is outstanding - his design finally living up to his legendary status. This minifig looks like Lando. (On a side note though - it is time for Cloud City sets. They are long overdue.)</p>

<p>I was very much looking forward to this set. I have two previous A-Wings - the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7134-1/A-wing-Fighter"">original release from 2000</a> (which seems laughingly primitive now, even though it DOES have a functional storage area for a crate), and the green ROTJ variation from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7754-1/Home-One-Mon-Calamari-Star-Cruiser"">Home One in 2009</a> (this was also the only other set with General Calrissian). So I was curious to see what another 8-9 years of design evolution would bring.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I was disappointed. It&#39;s possible that with a few modifications, some of my concerns would be fixed, but the thought process put into the design seems incomplete in some areas. There are concerns about stability in the set and in playability, and that is a letdown for sure.</p>

<p>At $39.99 USD, it&#39;s not completely out of line, but a set of this size and these figures would be more appropriate at $29.99 or close to this range.</p>

"Japanbuilder","2017-08-29T02:50:16.52Z","Green Leader standing by!","<p>Well for those LEGO builders who like to fleet build or squadron build this set is a joy to get. Specially since it follows so close after last year&#39;s Rebels based A-Wing prototype set. For most others though the only draw is one of the minifigures in the set and not much else. Let&#39;s take a look at this set a bit more closely.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures: </strong></p>

<p>We get 3 very cool figures in this set. Some of which were in need of an update very badly. First up and the reason lots of folks will probably get this set is Lando. We get a very nice version of him here. He comes with 2 faces and both fit his personality very well. We also get the version of him as an Alliance General so that is a treat specially for fleet builders. His torso prints are very well executed front and back and his cape is of the newer cloth type. He comes with a blaster that has a techniq pin for a barrel extension.</p>

<p>[img]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4386/36051730843_f18d08f007.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>Next up is our A-Wing Pilot. I am not sure if he is the fabled Green Leader but he surely is a member of that squadron, at least to me. He gets fantastic detailing on his helmet and torso prints. These marry up nicely down his hips and legs. The prints alone are also a huge step up from last year&#39;s A-Wing pilot which was a bit simpler in design.</p>

<p>Last up is our Rebel ground crew figure. This figure is also SUPER useful to army build or fleet build with as his presence helps to round out a hangar or maintenance scene. I sort of wish the set had come with 2 of these guys I really think they are very useful for MOCs and other scenes. We get great prints on him as well going down to the legs.</p>

<p><strong>The Build and Parts: </strong></p>

<p>Following so soon after another A-Wing we get a set with welcome pieces though if you got last year&#39;s set this one has many of the same parts. The build itself was enjoyable, however, even it it is a bit simpler than last year&#39;s model. The parts are also in distinct colors which may be a bit of a issue for those wanting matching A-Wings with last year&#39;s set.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Set: </strong></p>

<p>The final piece is great. We get a maintenance shuttle with ladder and the A-Wing. The shuttle is not that fancy but it looks the part in a hangar scene or just next to the A-Wing doing repairs or refueling.</p>

<p>The A-Wing itself is slick and smooth. It looks great from almost every angle. It is also very swooshable and this will help with play. Also unlike last year&#39;s model this one has dispensed with the rubber band mechanism and opted for simpler button configurations for the spring loaded shot. I personally prefer the rubber band build as it bulked up the craft more but this one is lighter and simpler. Though I do urge caution, remove the shots if you want to get a head on view of the craft. The buttons are very responsive and you could shoot yourself in the face if you are not paying attention. Same goes when you take photos of this thing, watch those things!</p>

<p>The only gripes I have with the craft is that the panel piece used to sit the figure is very weak or was weak on mine, the figure slips right out of it. So I had to replace that with studs instead. The other gripe is that in order to blend the cockpit piece in with the rest of the chassis the pilot cabin is a bit squared-off. This prevents the pilot from actually reaching for his controls. You will have to sit him hands down or with his hands unnaturally up high in order to sit him upright in the cabin. Other than it is cool. It sits higher on landed mode compared to last year&#39;s (which sat flush) and the folding engine pods are totally absent here. Overhang pieces prevent those going up and slider plates prevent inside folding. The canter on the wings is just about right.</p>

<p><strong>Comparisons: </strong></p>

<p>I am sure some folks will want to see how this thing compares to last year&#39;s model, which was a bit divisive in some corners. Nevertheless, here you are:</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts: </strong></p>

<p>If you love the A-Wing and don&#39;t mind the new brick built engine pods and canter solution than this is a great set for you. If you want to pair it with last year&#39;s model, aside from the colors, it is also a great pick. Also wait for this one to go on sale. It costs about as much last year&#39;s if it had been sold alone and this one feels a bit lighter.&nbsp;If the only draw are the figures then perhaps focusing&nbsp;your resources on those would be better than buying a set whose vehicle you don&#39;t like. For the main target audience though, this is one great bird!</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-03-11T16:07:41.32Z","Nice set, but not at RRP","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>An A-wing Starfighter&nbsp;was missing from my collection, and seeing it at a discount made me decide to get one. Even at a discount, the set felt small for its price.</p>

<p>The build was fun and easy, and can be completed easily well within an hour.&nbsp;There were quite a few stickers; applying them was easy, and IMHO they do add something to the A-wing and the ground cart. Other than the yellow/black warning bar, there were no printed pieces. The A-wing looks nice, the ground vehicle is a nice addition, and overall it is a nice set to have, if one ignores the RRP. This set is IMHO much overpriced, and only offers reasonable value for money when found at a significant discount. If found at $ 30,- or 30-35&nbsp;euros this set is IMHO becoming worth it . Otherwise, I would personally spend my money on other sets.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The set comes in three bags, of which the first one (with the ground vehicle) is rather small and a quick build. The other two contain the A-wing. The build was easy; nothing truly stood out as far as construction techniques are concerned, though it was nice to see how the designer created the angle for the engines (and winges) and built up the body of the A-wing. I have not built the green&nbsp;A-wing opposing Darth Vader&#39;s Tie-fighter, but when comparing this set with that particular A-wing, I think the design is an improvement - especially the integration and firing mechanism for the missile shooters. An 8 year old, and even younger children should be able to build it, though they might need some help with the stickers.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>This set comes with three minifigures: Lando Calrissian, an A-wing pilot and a Rebel ground crew member. Apparently all minifigures are unique. Although Lando is the most important character in the Star Wars saga of the three, personally I like the A-wing pilot the most.</p>

<p>Lando Calrissian is the most well known character.&nbsp;The torso print is nice and on the front and back; the front is much nicer, IMHO. His arms are of a different colour&nbsp;plastic. There are two face prints (the only figure in this set to have a double print). There is no print on the legs, and the light blue cape is made of soft cloth. Lando is armed with a big blaster gun</p>

<p>The A-wing pilot is to me the best figure in the set. He wears a green pilot suit. There is a print on the front and back of the torso, and the front print is continued nicely onto the legs (almost all the way down to the feet). The helmet is moulded in two colours, with additional details printed on - which was well done for my copy. The pilot is armed with a small blaster.</p>

<p>The Rebel ground crew member wears a tan overall and cap. The torso is printed on the front and back, and there are two pockets printed on the legs. His face print is nice, with a head set print.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Overall, this A-wing looks quite good, compact yet still somewhat sleek, but not as iconic as for instance the X-wing or Tie-Fighters.I like the colour scheme and the look of the guns to the side of the wings. The angled engines (and stabilizers) look great, and I like the angle they are placed in. Other than (of course) the underside, the A-wing IMHO does not have a bad side. The landing gear is simple in design and&nbsp;can be folded; it is close to being too looking flimsy to support the fighter. The cockpit is OK and quite spacious. I do not like the fact that there is no rear bulkhead, which means that small pieces - like the pilot&#39;s blaster - can fall into the structure of the A-wing and subsequently bounce around.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>IMHO the A-wing is above all a play set, much more than a display set. The fighter has great swooshability, and the shooters are easy to launch, but normally will not be launched by accident. IMHO the A-wing is of such size that it can be handled easily by a child. The ground vehicles and minifigures also point to this being a play set.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>The A-wing is a good set, if not for one major element: the price, at least its RRP. It is massively overpriced IMHO. Even in comparison with similar or even higher priced sets (in price per part)&nbsp;like Anakin&#39;s&nbsp;custom Jedi starfighter&nbsp;(75087)&nbsp;and the Naboo starfighter&nbsp;(75092) it feels overpriced. Part of the issue, IMHO, is that the A-wing as a vehicle&nbsp;simply is not special enough to compensate for its price. The three minifigures do not come close to making&nbsp;up for this either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If one ignores the price, this is not a bad set, especially for play. If found at a serious discount - under $30 or 35 euros - this set becomes worth it, IMHO. Otherwise I would save my money for other sets.</p>
