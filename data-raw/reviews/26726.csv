<p>&nbsp;The minifgure selection is also great as it gives you a bunch of new figs and some excellent detail with all of them, including the sharks. &nbsp;Also returning is Jack sparrow in an all new torso. &nbsp;The size of the set is also of great value as it&#39;s ~$250 and well worth it.</p>

<p>&nbsp; If you&#39;re an adult fan, you will love this set. &nbsp;</p>

I think that the side pieces are to heavy for the one and two hanger pieces that hold them in place.&nbsp;</p>
