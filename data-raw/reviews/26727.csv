"Psychic_Tempest_Zero","2017-08-04T18:09:28.957Z","Ninjago at its finest.","<p>Ah, from the moment I first saw this set, I knew it was for me.&nbsp; I was not disappointed. &nbsp;This Bounty puts the 2015 one to shame, just as that one put the 2012 to shame, and even that was not a terrible set. &nbsp;This set has UCS quality to it, and it&#39;s clear the designers gave the project a lot of love. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Building Experience:</p>

<p>This was a nice&nbsp;set to build, and it took me about 4.5 hours total (I am a fast builder). &nbsp;It had some trickiness to it at times, and I made one or two mistakes that I had to correct. &nbsp;I only have two issues with the build: 1. It&#39;s very repetitive at times, 8 of this, 16 of this, and although the finished product looks great, it takes away from enjoying the build. &nbsp;2. The dark red hinged rails gave me some trouble, as they don&#39;t really firmly rest in any one spot, even when the model is finished.</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>Good parts, very little new ones entirely. &nbsp;I won&#39;t go into great detail, but the parts of this set alone would make my younger self not leave my Lego room for a week. &nbsp;The sails are much nicer than previous ones, which were a big problem on past Bounties. &nbsp;They can crinkle if handled too roughly, but that&#39;s really only a problem for young builders.</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>I feel the figures are not the highlight of this set. &nbsp;They&#39;re not bad, but not on par with the level of detail that was present in the HoT wave. &nbsp;The ninja suits are not my favorite, but arm printing is always nice to see. &nbsp;The fabric skirts for Wu and Nya are not fantastic, and once again must be handled carefully. &nbsp;I would have liked to see ninja hair pieces included in the set, so now I&#39;m gonna have to buy Temple of the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon for them alone. &nbsp;Everybody but Wu has an alternate face, which is nice, and these are the full-on ninja, no missing armor or rebooted half-masks here, and everybody has the right weapons.</p>

<p>Build and Playability:</p>

<p>The ship finally has below deck space, and it&#39;s fully furnished. &nbsp;Wu&#39;s bedroom, a Bathroom, and a few weapon walls, packed with Easter Eggs (Garmadon helmet, Anacondrai Skull, Aeroblade, Djinn Blade handle, Vermillion armor chest plate, picture frame of the original ninja). &nbsp;There&#39;s some unused space in the bow, which I find a little weird,&nbsp;and they leave just enough space open to get small parts stuck in it.&nbsp; Ugh. &nbsp;There&#39;s no wall&nbsp;between the two rooms, so if a ninja has to use the bathroom in the middle of the night, Wu gets woken up. &nbsp;Picking up&nbsp;the model can be a challenge, as the sandbags really get in the way, but you learn how to lift it right. &nbsp;The level of detail everywhere is just great, a rudder, the sculpting of the hull, the beautiful dragon heads, the ladders, lanterns, flags, potted plants, fishing lines, crates (containing 1x2 spinner cards for Sensei Wu DX and NRG Kai)... just... good stuff. &nbsp;The masts get in the way a little bit, but I&#39;m fine with that, they really are a good size. &nbsp;The deck space is good. &nbsp;The removable sections are good. &nbsp;The anchors are good, and the ship&#39;s wheel with a compass, which were missing from the last bounty. More flags, lanterns, and good detail on the stern&nbsp;of the ship. &nbsp;There&#39;s some slightly hard to reach areas under the roof, minor gripe. &nbsp;I especially like &#39;Destiny&#39;s Bounty&#39; written in English and Ninjago language on the back of the ship. The balcony with telescope are awesome. &nbsp;Tons of little things like a map and sextant are included, but unlike the last bounty, they actually have room to fit on the ship, and little homes to go in. &nbsp;The stickers are used effectively, and they really add to the model. &nbsp;This is near perfection.</p>

<p>Verdict:</p>

<p>The deal you get for $160 here is a bargain. &nbsp;The set has both playability and display value. &nbsp;It&#39;s a big, imposing model that really looks good on display in particular, and doesn&#39;t need a bunch of stud shooters to be fun to play with. &nbsp;Minifigures&nbsp;are good, detail is good, sturdiness is good. &nbsp;This is one of my top 5 favorite Ninjago&nbsp;sets ever. &nbsp;I highly recommend this set.</p>

"apcsb","2017-08-27T01:24:43.777Z","Has its flaws, but nevertheless AWESOME","<p><strong>TL/DR: Go get it! Great display model!</strong></p>

<p>Details.</p>

<p>OK, no reason to repeat what you can see in the YouTube reviews, so let&#39;s talk about what you will not see there.</p>

<p>* Some parts are a hassle to build, expecially the &quot;side bands&quot;, which area pain to align properly.</p>

<p>* Picking up and holding the model is a problem, since there are many areas (side bands, the pontoons on the sides etc) that will move or fall off. There are just a few areas where you can pick the model reliably.</p>

<p>* When you try playing with it, you quickly realize that the internal spaces are all very cramped, and too small for adult fingers, and there are tons of fragile parts that fall off easily all over the place, but especially on the main deck area. This is a display model, not a play model.</p>

<p>* For a display model we should have received proper double-sided sails.. Given that sails are not symmetrical, this is a very one-sided display model... Very, very bad.. Lego</p>

<p>* Minifigs. Honestly, why did they provide those wrinkly-crinkly skirts, especially for Wu, who will not fit in the designated bed. Second, I like the split masks and all that but the faces... Oh, why?... &nbsp;On the positive side - you get all the Wu Cru together.</p>

<p>* There are means provided to store ninja&#39;s weapons and there is very little space left on the ship. But a hook/clip here and there will solve the problem. Honesly, I expected them to be there from the start.</p>

<p>* Similarly, there is no place for ninjas to sleep, except the open sky on the main deck (and maybe Nya gets the dojo). I would prefer seeing the ship a bit longer, but with a couple bunk beds, like the one in Ninjago City.</p>

<p>* You do get a generous selection of spares/extras, but not too many new parts.</p>

<p><strong>Now, why all this doesn&#39;t matter...</strong></p>

<p>Despite all the bad stuff, this is still an awesome model and great build experience. It already has a great price per piece ration, but given that it&#39;s not an exclusive set, one can buy it with a discount off Amazon (I bought mine with 20% off - a no-brainer). But even at full price it&#39;s worth it.</p>

<p>Not to mention a true innovation from Lego for the sets of this size - one bag per instruction step! I did not even expect how AWESOME it is! Just try building the&nbsp;Bucket Wheel Excavator, where at each step you open 4-7 bags and then easily spend 15mins just digging for that one part, and you&#39;ll FEEL the difference. I want all future LEGO sets, no matter how big, be like that!</p>

<p>Anyway, what did I say in the beginning?.. Go get it! Worth every penny!</p>

<p>Bag one gives you master wu as well as the base of the ship.</p>

<p>Bag two, three, four and five finishes the base and give you jay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bag six, seven and eight creates the deck and includes L-loyd ;P Kai, Nya and Cole.</p>

<p>Bag nine, ten and eleven build the dojo and the dragons in the front&nbsp;and includes Zane.</p>

<p>Bag twelve, thirteen and fourteen includes the top of the ship including a very cool roof.</p>

<p>Bag fifteen finalizes the build with the very cool sails.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was a really fun building experience and I love all the new and cool pieces like the new sail and 2 x 2 plate with two studs on one side and no studs on the other side (I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s called). I also like the fun building techniques like golden bananas as eyebrows for the dragons!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set includes all the ninjas and master wu, it also includes a well amount of fishes!&nbsp;</p>

"DutchFlyer","2017-09-24T17:11:57.4Z","Display and some play","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This model is more a display than a play model - too many fidgety parts that can easily come loose or break off (tip of masts, bouys on the side, the lanterns). Building it is a very nice experience. The size is also such that carrying it around might be too much for children.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build experience was very good - while building the hull&nbsp;the ship looked rather small to me, but when constructing the deck it suddenly exploded in size (especially width). There are quite a few stickers in very visible spaces (especially around the stern), which I myself do not mind. I am building for fun (not speed), and therefore Windex and some patience go a very long way. As you build the ship in sections that are eventually combined into a single whole it is not always clear how the result will look. For instance, many of the visible gaps disappear when the dojo is in place on the ship.</p>

<p>There are some nice and interesting construction techniques used (for the deck grates, parts of the stern).&nbsp;Some elements are a little repetitive to build, but overall not too much. There is some interesting use of pieces (a bucket and sextant for instance to build the telescope)The build steps are logical, and the ship as a whole is nicely broken up in manageable parts. The dragon&#39;s heads are awesome, and IMHO so is the stern of the ship. Attaching the railings on either side and attaching them properly was the most tricky part of the build.</p>

<p>The given age range for this set is 9-14 years. As far as technical difficulty I would say they are about right. However, this IMHO is a set that is too big and requires too much concentration to build in one go or even one day; I myself built it over two days, and frankly I cannot imagine building it in one day and still having fun doing so. I would think most children also need some help applying the stickers, as some of them are in highly visible places and an integral part of the build.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>The minifigs&nbsp;are fairly standard - Master Wu and the whole crew in Ninja gear with their own weapons. Nya has the cloth armour&nbsp;and is grey, and Wu the cloth bottom part of his kimono. They are okay, but no more than that. As mentioned by others, there are no hairpieces for the Ninja provided (those are in the Temple of the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon set. The Ninja head gear is of the the two-part variety. No villains are included in this set.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>When finished the ship is massive and simply looks awesome.&nbsp;The ship seems to be a mix of a Chinese junk (the overall shape and sails) and 17th century European sailing vessels (the stern).&nbsp;Personally I like that the designers have chosen not to mix &#39;modern&#39; and &#39;old&#39; too much in this model (the exhausts and engine on top being the only elements). The best view of the exterior&nbsp;IMHO is looking from the backboard stern as to me the&nbsp;stern is the most beautiful section of the ship. The dragon&#39;s heads draw attention as well, and are among the better dragon head designs in Lego. I love the colour scheme used throughout the ship.</p>

<p>The interior is fully fleshed out (a dojo, navigation deck, Master Wu&#39;s quarters, and a head), and made accessible because the ship is constructed&nbsp;in segments that can be taken off to gain access and pose figures: the navigation deck, the dojo and part of the main deck can all be removed (thouhg taking out the main deck part is somewhat tricky). The roof of the navigation deck is made of garage door pieces and can be rolled up, but there is nothing to hold it in place (so only one side can be opened up).</p>

<p>There are many references to the Ninjago series throughout the ship, and even the Ninjago&nbsp;Movie universe (for instance the map print). I do not know them all though (being fairly new to the theme).</p>

<h2>Playability vs display</h2>

<p>I think the playability of this set is limited. The size alone makes Destiny&#39;s Bounty a&nbsp;hassle to handle as an adult,&nbsp; and I would guess difficult if not impossible to handle for younger children. Many of the details break off fairly easily, and only the main deck itself is easily accessible. To access other areas, the ship has to be taken apart (as it is modular in design). That said, the designers have tried to provide ample&nbsp;opportunity&nbsp;to pose figures (for instance, 2x2 -stud-in-the-middle tiles for the Dojo).</p>

<p>As a display model, I think it is among the best Lego has on offer and can legitimately compete with the likes of Ninjago&nbsp;City, the Lego&nbsp;Modulars&nbsp;or the Star Wars UCS series - and that is before comparing the price of this set with that of Ninjago&nbsp;City and Star Wars UCS sets.</p>

<p>I bought this set myself to be a display model - thus my 5-star rating for value for money.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>If you are looking for a Ninjago&nbsp;Movie set primarily for play and with all the Ninjas (though not Master Wu) I would go for the Temple of the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon. The old Destiny&#39;s Bounty (set 70738) IMHO also offers more play features (though not looking as good).</p>

<p>I am well aware that this new Destiny&#39;s Bounty&nbsp;set is not cheap, and not easily affordable for many. Yet to me, when&nbsp; looking at the combination of price, size and looks of the model, this set is almost impossible to beat. I therefore hope that Lego will have this set on offer for a long time, to give as many people as possible an opportunity to save for this set and adding something special to their collection.</p>

"ThePirates123","2018-01-01T14:04:30.097Z","One of my favourite Lego sets of all time","<p>Seeing this marvelous set in the Lego store made me instantly want it. Not owning any of the other versions of The Destiny&#39;s Bounty (9446-1 from 2012 and 70738-1 from 2015) it was a jewel to my collection. And honestly, I&#39;m glad I didn&#39;t&nbsp;pick the other versions of the ship because this one is obviously the best one, even though the price was more than&nbsp;double.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>Building the ship was a lot of fun. Took around 6 hours to build, and includes many unique types of builds. The building begins with the lower part of the ship&nbsp;and slowly starts forming the inside. Then, it starts building the deck, the training dojo, the cabin above, and then adds all the other details such as the sails and&nbsp;lanterns. The building is always fun and kind of innovative too. Although it gets kind of repetitive at some points, namely the dragon heads, sail construction (which is not the exact same but is very similar), lanterns and the exterior appearance of the ship, it doesn&#39;t make building it any less fun and exciting, at least for me.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>The parts were pretty decent, some big ones that were used the shape the ship that are pretty unique and also featured a few weapon/head items&nbsp;that were really nice to see following the original Ninjago theme such as:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Djinn Blade Base</li>
	<li>Aeroblade&nbsp;Base</li>
	<li>Anacondrai Head Piece</li>
	<li>Pearl Gold Hat (which is always a nice surprise for me)</li>
	<li>Short Bone</li>
	<li>Black Samurai Head Piece</li>
	<li>Vermillion neck piece</li>
	<li>Gray &quot;Leaf&quot; Piece&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Not to mention the amazing looking sails, which look a lot better than their older counterparts. I like the new colors. Some might say that the fact that they are not double sided is a problem, but considering how they were put together, it makes total sense.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>Although the set was great, the minifigures were quite a disappointment for me. It included the Ninja in their uniforms and masks, which could&nbsp;already be collected&nbsp;from other sets of the same wave. I believe that the Sensei Wu minifigure had a new face, which looked more excited and it was a really nice addition to the other similar faces, but other than that, no exclusive printing on any torsos or legs.</p>

<p>For anyone wanting a complete list the ship includes the following minifigures:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Kai with Neck piece and 3 katanas, two faces (angry, surpised/happy)</li>
	<li>Jay with TM weapon, two faces (angry, surprised/happy)</li>
	<li>Zane with Neck Piece (arrows) and bow, two faces (angry, super happy)</li>
	<li>Nya with TM weapon (new spear piece) and leg fabric, two faces (angry, small smile)</li>
	<li>Lloyd with TM weapon (new curved sword piece), two faces (angry, cool)</li>
	<li>Cole with TM weapon (big hammer), two faces (angry, cool/happy)</li>
	<li>Sensei Wu with Wooden Stick (big), beard neck piece, leg fabric and happy face</li>
</ul>

<h2>Playability</h2>

<h3>----IT DOESN&#39;T FLOAT----</h3>

<p>The ship is full of&nbsp;weapons and features than can be used for play. It also has a bed below the training space (which is innovative and cool) but apart from that no other real places for the ninja to sleep... which seems a bit unconventional. I mean, the Temple of Airjitsu&nbsp;(70751) didn&#39;t have any bed space neither which annoyed me quite a bit but Ninjago&nbsp;City really rocked it with the bed space. Anyway, there is a small space to watch for incoming pirate ships behind the training room. There is space under the deck, with a toilet, including a sink with the&nbsp;new amazing sink piece and&nbsp;some sweet TP. What I found quite annoying is that placing a minifig on the toilet, one can&#39;t put the deck back on. The upper deck has some tea space (which is interrupted by the sail) and some trading cards and fish. It also includes 2 fishing rods. The upper deck and the upper, driving, cabin are full of plants and greenery.</p>

<h2>The Completed Model &amp;&nbsp;My thoughts</h2>

<p>The completed model is a great display piece and the colors are vivid and really matching. It has lots of playability and great parts and I think it is totally worth buying. I bought it for 210&euro;, which was a little expensive but I am really satisfied by the build. I 100% recommend it.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! I hope this helped!</p>

<p>The retail price for this set is &pound;110, $160 which is a great price, and if i&#39;m honest i think the UK price is probably&nbsp;under priced. When i first saw this set I thought it would cost at least &pound;140 but LEGO shocked me with a great price, this means this set has a great price per piece at 4.8p or 7c.</p>

<p>In this set there are 7 minifigures, Jay, Nya, Kia, Lloyd, Zane, Cole and Master Wu. Of those seven, Cole and Wu are exclusive to this set in their variants (at the moment away) There are also 4 fish in this three silver and one orange.</p>

<p>To go along with the figures there are a ton of weapons, including the all important&nbsp;Ultimate Ultimate weapon which is the same build that is in other Ninjago&nbsp;Movie sets. There are also more weapons inside the ship.</p>

<p>The ship has three levels, the ground floor includes Wu&#39;s room which has a bed that can fit Wu in and a table with a photo of the five ninjas and a hat also there is a weapons rack. Also on the ground floor there is a bathroom with a toilet and sink opposite that there is another weapons rack.</p>

<p>The Deck level has the most amount of detail, there are four plant boxes and a lot of crates with different contents like two trading cards, fish, a drink can, broom and a spade.There is a play feature with the anchors, as a piece&nbsp;can be turned causing the anchors&nbsp;to go up or down.&nbsp;Also the poles holding two of the three sails&nbsp;are on the deck level which has a string that have three red lanterns and two flags. The room on the deck level has a dojo training room that includes a ton of weapons and makes that &pound;9 Dojo Training set look useless.</p>

<p>The top floor has the steering&nbsp;wheel for the boat and a table that has a map&nbsp;on top of it. The roof of the top floor uses 32 garage pieces in tan that makes the roof look like popsicle&nbsp;sticks which i like. On top of the roof there is the third sail which is the least interesting of the three.</p>

<p>Overall this set is the best LEGO boat set EVER and potentially the best LEGO set of 2017. Nothing is bad about this set. All 7 figures are great, the build is marvelous and fun.</p>

"Spruce","2022-03-21T13:30:58.18Z","Destiny's Bounty, LEGO set 70618","<p><strong>Pre-Release Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I was one of the people stupid enough not to but this upon release, leading me to have to buy it for almost double the price in the after-market. I loved the set upon release, but the other Lego Ninjago Movie sets kept me busy.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong></p>

<p>The set was quite a fun build as you get to see the ship come together. I was not initially expecting the size of the Bounty to be so big. The most fun part of this was building the interior and adding all kinds of small details. The model really goes together well and no parts of it are annoying to construct.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>The completed build has a large magnitude. Every angle of this is filled with meticulous detail. I am&nbsp;impressed by the immense play value&nbsp;featured on the Bounty. There are multiple rooms where you can place minifigures and enact stories. Along with this, the model is surprisingly sturdy and can be carried easily. Still, moving the model around may be hard as it is quite heavy.</p>

<p>There are two levels below the deck, an impressive amount for LEGO ships. One room at the back of the ship contains Master Wu&#39;s sleeping quarters and a lot of memorabilia from previous seasons of Ninjago. My favourite detail is a painting of the Ninja from the show. The room in from of it is the restroom. It has some clever piece usage to form the toilet. It also has a sink with a drain and some artefacts hung on the other side of the wall.Moving up to the deck, there are two dragon heads hung on the front of the ship with a space in the middle for minifigures to sit. As we continue towards the back of the deck, we can see potted plants and other supplies placed on the sides of the deck. There are even fishing rods placed on the side.&nbsp;A dojo is placed above the deck. The dojo is wonderfully detailed with&nbsp;weapons and armor stored inside it. There are 6 2x2 jumper plates, making enough room to place all the ninja inside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Above the dojo, a platform is placed where you can find the ship&#39;s wheel and a telescope. There are small silver details surrounding this platform. The roof of this room consists of small garage door panels in tan, a beautiful part usage. These panels can be lifted to reveal a map and more standing room inside.</p>

<p>The Bounty even looks good from the back. There is a pipe system on the two levels above deck, and while this is purely for looks, it makes the ship seem more realistic. There is a small platform behind the dojo where up to 3 minifigures can&nbsp;stand and look through a cleverly-built telescope. Both of these floors use some 1x4 modified plates in gold to show windows. Up at the top, there&#39;s a flag that reads &ldquo;dojo&rdquo;&nbsp;in Ninjargon.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>There isn&#39;t much to talk about in this category. We have all 6 main ninja in their Ninjago Movie suits. Lloyd is easily my favourite, the black and green on this figure look amazing and the arm printing compliments the torso and legs well. Jay uses a nice mix of regular blue, dark blue, and black. These colours look great on him. Kai is easily the most boring of all of these, with almost exclusively&nbsp;red and black on his torso and legs. Cole has a simple but effective design, and the arm printing makes this figure much better. Zane has a simple white and black colour scheme, which makes the figure feel more robotic. Nya is one of my favourite of these ninja figures, as she has a cool cloth piece and arm printing, which both compliment her gunmetal grey, silver, and azure colour scheme. Finally, there&#39;s Wu. He has a nicely detailed cloth skirt, but is missing the arm printing shown in the film.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>70618 has an incredible price-per-part ratio. The set has 2295 pieces for only $160! The set&#39;s value is also much more than $160. There is incredible play and display value within the model. The set can be a great gift for people of any age.</p>

<p>The Ninjago Movie Destiny&#39;s Bounty is easily the best of all of them. It is an amazing display piece and has a high value for anyone. While it&#39;s not without its flaws, I believe this is still one of, if not the best minifigure scale boat that LEGO has released. This is a 10/10 for me, and I recommend buying it before the price skyrockets.</p>
