"LEGODUDE1","2018-12-16T22:25:02.83Z","Lego Sandbox","<p>Minecraft is a great game. You can build whatever you desire, or survive against monsters, mine rare ores, and&nbsp;build amazing bases with the resources you have. LEGO Minecraft&nbsp;was first created through LEGO Cuusoo. There was a LEGO set called <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/21102-1"">Minecraft&nbsp;Micro World: The Forest.</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>LEGO Minecraft&nbsp;has expanded ever since then.</p>

<p>The Crafting Box 2.0 is just one of the amazing LEGO sets that has been produced after The Forest.</p>

<p>PARTS</p>

<p>There are many 2x2 bricks in this set, which is expected, since it is Minecraft. There are lots of 2x4 bricks that support the ground. There are some special pieces, such as the pickaxe, cow, donkey, creeper, and chest. All of these produced to make these special models.</p>

<p>PURPOSE</p>

<p>This LEGO set has 15 different models to make. There are 5 bags, each with pieces that can make 3 different models, using up all of the pieces, unlike some 3 in 1 LEGO Creator sets. If you build 5 of the models, you can combine them together to make a world, just like one you would see in the game. I also own <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/21143-1"">the Nether Portal</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/21141-1"">The Zombie Cave</a>, so it makes the set really come to life to combine those, also because it is so easy to do so.</p>

<p>MINIFIGURES AND&nbsp;MOBS</p>

<p>Steve is the key minifigure in the set. He is also the only minifigure in the set. The donkey has a special head piece, and the rest is brick-built. The Creeper has a special mold, with two 2x1 flat green plates on the sides. The cow is like the donkey, with a head mold, and a brick-built body. The other hostile mob is the slime, which is basically a Minecraft&nbsp;head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>MODEL 1</p>

<p>The first model can depict a tower, a cabin, or a bridge. The bridge is my favorite, because there is a non-technical sliding mechanism that enables you to put a beam with the stairs on the right, or the stairs on the left, which means you can only walk one set of stairs at a time.</p>

<p>MODEL TWO<br />
<br />
Model Two has either one or two trees, and some lava. There is also a donkey, which is the only functional part of the set.</p>

<p>MODEL THREE</p>

<p>There is a cave with a Creeper. TNT helps you make clever Technic contraptions to destroy the Creeper, using 3 pieces of cobblestone. There is also Redstone ore in one of the models.</p>

<p>MODEL FOUR</p>

<p>The cow is either enclosed in a regular pen, or a pen with a roof. There is also a gate with a fence.</p>

<p>MODEL FIVE</p>

<p>The final three models consist of stairs leading up to a treasure chest, a farm with different crops, or an abandoned mineshaft.</p>

<p>In all, Minecraft is a sandbox game, and this is a wonderful model, which helps you recreate the wonders of Notch&#39;s creation in bricks.</p>
