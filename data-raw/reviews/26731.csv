"toeboe","2017-05-19T08:27:04.73Z","Move along, Move along !!","<p>Over the past few years the new range of Lego buildable figures have grown into quite a nice collection, showcasing some fantastic new and iconic figures from all the star wars movies, this new figure &quot;The Stormtrooper Commander&quot; is&nbsp;easily one of the best to date, up there with the likes of Darth Vader and General Grevious, and why has it took so long to be released ?? well at least it&#39;s here now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build process of the main figure is quite straightforward no tricky mechanisms to deal with, the gun is a little more complex, but if your used to building these guns it wont be a problem, only 100 parts in total,&nbsp;Lego have given you the option of two gun designs (short and long) depending on if you choose to make the Stormtrooper a commander or not (&nbsp;i.e if you remove the commanders pauldron ) this is a nice feature and maybe one which will no doubt encourage people to buy more than one&nbsp;model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion i have to say this is a great model, possibly my favourite so far (sorry General Grevious) well worth the UK price point of &pound;19.99, I like most people usually wait for reductions on these sets and very rarely buy them on release,&nbsp;but this set was a no brainer ive been waiting for its release and i just had to have to it, the design of this character is&nbsp;truly iconic it takes you right back to 1977 and the first Star Wars instalment &quot;A New Hope&quot;and it&nbsp;looks&nbsp;amazing displayed, it has took such a long time for Lego to get around to releasing a Stormtrooper but it was worth the wait, its nice to see they are revisiting all the movies within this series and hopefully in the future Darth Maul will finally make an appearance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"redragenemo","2017-06-05T05:58:16.917Z","75531: Stormtrooper Commander","<p>For this set, we will be looking at the Stormtrooper commander buildable figure which was released by LEGO in 2017 this year, which i think is iconic considering that this year is the 40th anniversary of the star wars release in the cinema. To have the iconic stormtrooper&nbsp;as a buildable figure, is certainly very good to add to all star wars fans collection.</p>

<p>GOOD:</p>

<p>For the set, i am very pleased with the fact that LEGO has nailed the detail for the head sculpt and has captured the amazing look&nbsp;of the figure. I am also very pleased with this set as this set has managed to give fans not only 1 but 2 configurations for the blaster, which gives fans a chance to have a normal stormtrooper or a commander, which is a thumbs-up for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BAD:</p>

<p>For this set, i felt the pauldron is a little on this obstructing side as it obstructs quite a fair bit of mobility which makes posing for adults and teens a little of a hassle. The price of this set in Singapore is SGD $44.90 which to be honest, is on the pricey side, considering all the licencing&nbsp;that goes into the figure. The gun holstering was a good idea by LEGO, but when put onto the back of the figure looks a little odd and abit&nbsp;awkward.</p>

<p>Overall Thoughts</p>

<p>I think even though it has its flaws, i think is still worth getting. Given that it has some minor flaws and abit pricey, having one on display at home is definitely worth the money. The figure is definitely a good figure and i would recommend anyone reading this review to head down to their nearest toy store to get this.</p>

<p>This is a 9/10 for my rating.&nbsp;</p>
