"legopraetorian13114","2018-08-29T17:57:39.91Z","Snoke personal guard number 7","<p>LEGO 75529 PRAETORIAN GUARD</p>

<p>When pictures of this set wore relesed&nbsp;entire lego&nbsp;star wars fanbase was little suspicius&nbsp;because this was first &quot;sight&quot; of praetorian guards.But set was quite a pleasant suprise.</p>

<p>PARTS</p>

<p>At this set there is lot of red color to represent red armour&nbsp;(and black for the legs).Arms bring us most of new parts.New shulder wavely&nbsp;pieces and printed wrist pieces.</p>

<p>Like usually head is done pretty well.Iconic Japanesse&nbsp;style helmet we see on two guards in the&nbsp;movie.</p>

<p>Cloth piece is made out of very soft fabric and it covers most places on which connecting is visible.Luckily there arent&nbsp;very much of them.</p>

<p>Chest is very nice and highly detailed.</p>

<p>PLAY IDEAS</p>

<p>Ofcourse&nbsp;just like all LEGO sets this one also has infintity&nbsp;play ideas but here couple of them:</p>

<p>-TRAINING-Just imagine your guard is soon going to be tested to see is he enough skilled to be Snokes guard.</p>

<p>-FIGHTING REY-This idea is taken right out of the movie.Unfortunately for this set you need buildable figure Rey that came out in same wave.Ofcourse as I said this is idea pulled out from the movie.FIGHTING REY.</p>

<p>PRONS</p>

<p>-IMPORTANT FOR THE MOVIE</p>

<p>-LOT OF PLAYABILLITY&nbsp;</p>

<p>-AMAZING DESIGN</p>

<p>-ONE OF THE LAST 10 CHARACTERS OF BUILDABLE FIGURE LINE(RUMORED BUT PROBABLY THRUE)</p>

<p>-LOT OF EXCLUSIVE PARTS</p>

<p>CONS&nbsp;</p>

<p>-CAN BE PLAYED ONLY OF HARD SURFICE</p>

<p>OVERALL OPINION</p>

<p>Praetorian guard is one of the best&nbsp;sets of 2017 atleast by my opinoin.If you want it, hury.This isnt going to be for sale much longer</p>

"Lego_fan_","2019-04-19T18:55:47.92Z","Accurate collectible ","<p>this red elite praetorian guard is with a piece count of 92 and is about the height of the average Buildable figure. It comes with some highly detailed shoulder pads and helmet a flexible red skirt,two weapons that can turn into one,and possible legs, arms ,and head. This guys weapon can be turned from two small swords into a double sided one by clipping them together. I would highly recommend this highly detailed collect able to any Star Wars, or Lego fan.</p>
