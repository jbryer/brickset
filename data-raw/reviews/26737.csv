"darkshadow79","2017-08-09T20:02:58.797Z","A well-detailed Airport Fire Truck","<p>We finally get another rescue/fire truck after a hiatus of 14 years. For all of you adult fans the last one was 8454 Rescue Truck back in 2003.</p>

<p>Out of all the new sets that we&#39;re recently released here in the USA, I chose to purchase 5 of the 7, and out of those 5 we&#39;re all 3 summer-release sets.</p>

<p>I have to say I&#39;m plenty impressed with this set. I was surprised at how many pieces it had and the low price tag, so price per piece average made for excellent value. It has the usual items you would expect for a fire/rescue truck for an airport. Front nozzle, and over head nozzle, only with this release, the nozzle is much more playable. It not only is flexible and turns, it also raises up with the cherry picker type extension above the truck itself. All of the side panels open upwards to reveal some goodies, mainly tools and the like you would find with most emergency type pumper trucks. The vehicle has a 4-cylinder engine and a rear differential to feed the power of the engine to each of the rear wheels. Also, 2 of the 3 axles are steering axles, so you get 4-wheel steering, it is really cool to see this feature as it minimizes the turning radius of the truck.</p>

<p>You can also add set# 8293 to motorize the turning and raising of the boom, a nice feature absent from the eclectic predecessor, the 8454 Rescue Truck. A scale above the previous actual fire engine from 2006, which had limited features. The only thing that is missing in my mind are outriggers that would stabilize the truck when the boom is raised up for fighting a fire from atop. Also, the 8293 kit offers a LED light kit to illuminate two front top of the cab spotlights, a nice touch.</p>

<p>Overall, the only con I see with this model is the lack of outrigger stabilizers, but otherwise, its a well detailed, realistic model and well worth the money.</p>

<p>For children getting into medium level Technic, I think this model would be a great starting point, among so many other medium size sets of the last 2 years that are all still available on Lego.com.</p>

<p>Kudos to the designer of this model, it is an excellent representation and a perfect entry-level summer 2017 set.</p>

<p>Instructions are now available on Lego.com for the alternate model, rescue truck with boat. &nbsp;Looks good, but have not yet built that version.</p>

<p>Next review will be the 42069 Extreme Adventure. Stay tuned.</p>

"pinz","2018-01-08T00:19:26.833Z","nice set in the midrange segment","<p>Actually this set was not planned. My youngest wanted to other sets, but they where (even as they are in the current cataloge&nbsp;of Lego) not available in the stores (not even in the Lego-store).</p>

<p>So we opted for this one.</p>

<p>We started of together to build the set, but he is under the recommended age&nbsp;and it was close to bedtime, so I finished it for him. Why? because you have no sections that are packaged logically. Again 1000 parts on the table, needed by the next morning.</p>

<p>The building was more or less straight forward, only in the front was a tricky part where the seats are pinned on later, there I missed the fact that it should be on hole from the lower end. so I had to fix this later on.</p>

<p>The rest was straight forward, and again quite a lot of stickers. Hello Lego: we are puting a lot of cash into your models, so why not prints? And leaving the stickes off is not an option in this case. It is a firetruck after all, it has too look like one.</p>

<p>The functions are nice but for my taste it could have been one ore two more. After all it is almost 90 EUR set. It has a lot of room inside, that is on purpose. You can add power functions to it. This would elevate the price of the set to almost 130 EUR, because you need the set. In my opinion, leave it as it is. Just to have a light and 1 and a half function motorized&nbsp;add 40 EUR on top?</p>

<p>It has also a nice little tool-box, that you can take out. In case you would put the power functions in, you will loose this, there is then the battery&nbsp;put in.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>My son loves it, it is nice to play with, it turns surprisingly good, even if it is a rather long model (about 45cm). But it is not heavy and stable. You can open drawers the arm you can lift and turn, you have a little&nbsp;4&nbsp;piston engine that you can see working. Nice details and the shape is also close enough to the real rescue firetrucks at the airports.</p>

"sct","2020-09-06T08:13:02.367Z","Kind of a disappointment","<p>This set consists of a single vehicle, a large fire truck as my kids say, in truth an &quot;Airport rescue vehicle&quot;.</p>

<p>Building experience is mediocre in my opinion. For the most part it&#39;s building internals that don&#39;t seem to make much sense, you just follow the instruction blindly and hope it all works in the end. I prefer when the instruction guides you, but you can see the idea, the aim of the model while building it. In this case I was able to understand the wheel steering mechanism only.</p>

<p>Secondly, the model is largely hollow, and only near the end you build the outer &quot;shell&quot; that makes this vehicle look like an actual fire truck. And, to&nbsp; be frank, it remains largely hollow even when completed. The pictures on the box and those available on the web are taken from such an angle&nbsp;that you can not see it.</p>

<p>I have to admit that my kids played with this model for quite a while. It took my 3yo several minutes to understand how the fire hose rotation controls work, it was pleasant to look at him trying to figure it out, I could almost see the gears in his head turning.</p>

<p>As a&nbsp;parts source, I think this set is also mediocre. A lot of internal machinery:&nbsp;gears, rods, not many building bricks.</p>

<p>It is possible to add power functions to this model, though they allow only for controlling the extendable fire hose - and in 2 of 3 dimensions, because the third is controlled with a gear in the hose itself. It is not a great addition to this model in my opinion.</p>

<p>Overall, I expected more of this set. Better looks, better build experience, more to learn when building.&nbsp;</p>
