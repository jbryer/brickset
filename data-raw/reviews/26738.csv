"JULIAN_LOWE","2018-12-18T01:10:57.97Z","Cool Technic Build With Loads Of Cool Features","<p>This was a fun build, with playability in mind. Loads of quirky&nbsp;small touches, like the first aid box, opening boot (Trunk) with the slide out accessory tray, pop up roof, butterfly doors, side access to the canopy, and those great tracks with rubber inserts so they work on carpet!</p>

<p>I enjoyed the build, and my son enjoyed the playability.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Working engine</li>
	<li>Working hoist</li>
	<li>Opening hood and&nbsp;tailgate</li>
	<li>Butterfly doors</li>
	<li>Pop up canopy roof</li>
	<li>Side access to canopy</li>
	<li>Slide out accessory tray in canopy</li>
	<li>Purple parts</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Suspension is for show</li>
	<li>No place for power functions&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>I think this kit is a steal and undervalued in the market place.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s great to get the mudguards in a cheaper set than the supercars, except they are purple!&nbsp; Color is my only real complaint here, though I have to admire the push for something different than construction yellow.&nbsp; The black main structure and white &quot;tent&quot; work well, and while the purple/yellow combo is not hideous, it does hurt future parts use for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new thick cord is excellent and an improvement I didn&#39;t know I needed.&nbsp; I&#39;m also a fan of the 11 total 3 length axle connectors with pin in the middle (27940) and 6 suspension springs (4 soft and 2 hard).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>A little strange that a set with 2300+ pieces would not have numbered bags, but it actually made it a little more fun.&nbsp; Obviously as a kid the sets weren&#39;t as big, but&nbsp;it was so typical to just dump all the parts into one big pile on the floor.&nbsp; While I wasn&#39;t on the floor for this build, it was fun to go digging through the many many pieces.&nbsp; There isn&#39;t a traditional gear box, but there are plenty of ingenious mechanisms that are spread throughout the build.&nbsp; I had avoided too many spoilers and reviews before I began, so the wing door mechanism was especially fun.&nbsp; Also the tread sections are necessarily repetitive, but not overly so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Impressions</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t add the garish stickers, so my set has a slightly different look from the promotional materials.&nbsp; I&#39;m not overly excited about the purple, but the whole set has a very powerful, fun feel.&nbsp; The unconventional treads instead of wheels are not great for play, but the other features like winch, doors, tent and gear more than make up for it.&nbsp; Plus, hopefully this inspires technic designers to look outside the now common supercars.&nbsp; I hope to see more of this creativity in the future!</p>

"MrMajestical","2019-07-11T07:30:38.593Z","42069 Extreme Adventure","<p>The 42069 Extreme Adventure is probably my favorite set. I have a hard time choosing between the Volvo Loader and it. But, I&#39;ll leave my opinion&nbsp;out and just give the facts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was one of the handful of 40th Anniversary sets released in 2017. The model consists of 2382 elements. The manual is 394 pages, and consists of 555 steps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no breakdown by stages, so some sorting will need to be done. Assembly begins in the middle of the chassis, then continues with the V-8 engine, continues with the front frame and then moves to the rear. Cab, rear body, interior, rear drive system, front drive system, and finished with body panels and accessories.</p>

<p>This model is absolutely chocked full of detail features. Working from the front, there are absolutely amazing headlight assemblies and a quad-light push bar.&nbsp;A winch, controlled by a knob on the right behind the door, sits between.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Lift the detailed hood and there sits a sweet V-8 with butterfly injection. Then you see a nice set of sporty mirrors. Taking hold of the door and operating it, it swings out and up, while at the same time the lower portion swings down. The doors are actually connected to a set of shock absorbers to give it preloaded spring pressure to hold them open.</p>

<p>Taking a gander inside there is a nice set of bucket seats, a steering wheel with a guage behind, a floor shift. Close the door and behind it, there is a knob.</p>

<p>Turning this knob, and suddenly, the top of the camper starts to angle up. It&#39;s a pop-up tent for added room in the back! On the roof sits two pairs of repair tracks, and four highly detailed Jerry cans. As well as a pair of antenna and flood lamps.</p>

<p>Then, lifting the left body&nbsp;panel sits a small storage area, with the same on the right. In the left, a first aid kit and a fire extinguisher, the right, just an extingusher.</p>

<p>Coming to the back, operate the spare track wheel to unlock the rear door. In the back is a small area for.. whatever! Below that is a grab point. Slide open a small drawer, and there sits the most highly detailed lego shovel you can imagine!</p>

<p>Like the front, the rear has beautifully constructed lamp assemblies. Below that are dual outlet exhaust tips in chrome,&nbsp;two per side.</p>

<p>Going under, you see twin spring assemblies in chrome, holding up the detailed track assemblies. Each axle features open diffs, drive lines, and drive components for piston movement. As well as full suspension.</p>

<p>Steering is controlled via a HOG knob center of the roof. Decals on every panel, which may be just a bit much.</p>

<p>So, there you have it. With&nbsp;this set being released with the 42070 6X6 Tow Truck, I&#39;d pick the 42069 over it with no question. I do own both. The details and look of this set are absolutely phenomenal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To give one up and one down:</p>

<p>Pro: Details abound</p>

<p>Con: I had a hard time finding one, but I would say the decals are maybe a bit much. I&#39;m just fine with them, but I honestly had nothing else. This set is almost perfect to me.</p>
