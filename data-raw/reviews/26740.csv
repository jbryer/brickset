Some notable parts/builds in the main model include a table tennis table (which I really do like), a speaker, a green skateboard and&nbsp;a red guitar.&nbsp;The set is reasonably priced, even here in Australia and I am quite happy I somehow&nbsp;managed to pick it up for just $19 at Kmart. The set is a 3 in 1 and has instructions for all 3 models in one thick booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set comes with 2 minifigs: A man and a girl, and unlike many previous creator sets there is no real option to swap around the torsos and faces. The main option for the set features a small house by a pool and small garden area. Interior detail for this option is also the best out of the 3 and features a flat screen TV, large speaker and comfy-looking couch. The house is quite spacious despite its small size.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think the whole modular concept is good how you can mix and match bits of the model to create something different without actually disassembling&nbsp;any parts.&nbsp;However, one thing that I do not like about the whole modular system is that it removes the LEGO Creator building experience that we have been used to. Just a couple of years ago, Creator structures were of a more moderate difficulty with a higher level of detail and fully enclosed. One set i refer to is the Family House from 2013. One of my favourite&nbsp;LEGO sets of all time, the Family House had more &quot;depth&quot; to it and was a lot more difficult to build yet still being well within the ability of most kids. Creator should bring back these sorts of sets for slightly older&nbsp;kids and also AFOLs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>LEGO City is designed for the younger crowd with backless structures focusing more on a simple build, which is okay. But I believe that Creator should have a higher level of difficulty and detail that provides a structure that is more difficult to build than city without being as expensive or complicated as the Advanced Modular Buildings.&nbsp;The modular design also makes models more fragile to carry around from place to place, particularly for younger kids who this set was designed for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is still quite a nice set. It has some good features and is a great addition to any residential zone for any LEGO City no matter how big or small. It adds two &quot;everyday&quot; minifigs to the population of your city and would integrate well with other recent creator sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall rating: 6.5/10&nbsp;</p>
