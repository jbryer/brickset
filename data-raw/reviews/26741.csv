"Human1229","2017-06-06T22:54:45.907Z","Welcome to the 21st-century.... LEGO STYLE!","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;31068 Modular Modern House is a Creator set I was looking forward to getting. Now that I have built it after receiving&nbsp;it &nbsp;in the mail, was it worth the wait? I will be showing you the first and largest build of the three options.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Build:</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I normally would not do a section on the construction of such a small set, but I felt this was necessary. One of the most interesting parts of this 3-in-1 set&nbsp;is the fact that all three builds can be built with the same base. The first things the instructions require you to build are&nbsp;the two bases. Here is what they look like:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/j0mEZDw.jpg"" style=""width: 200px; height: 268px;"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/PVZPUKc.jpg"" style=""width: 200px; height: 268px;"" /></p>

<p>However, it goes from a structure with virtually the minimal amount of pieces to the detailed marvel you see on the box. First, you add some mini-structures that easily slide into the open spaces:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/9yEgZZf.jpg"" style=""width: 200px; height: 149px;"" /></p>

<p>Then you add the second story and... viola! It&#39;s finished!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/vzgfBRE.jpg"" style=""width: 200px; height: 150px;"" /></p>

<p>My main complaints are that the tall clear bricks can easily be mistaken for the tall white bricks in the booklet, and that the front porch is kind of loosely attached to the base, making it prone to falling apart.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model:</h3>

<p>Now that we&#39;ve finished building the set, let&#39;s look at everything it has to offer, shall we?</p>

<p>The house has an electric car charger on the left side (or right side, if you switch the two add-ons around) That can only mean one thing! This set has an electric car!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/Y6U44ah.jpg"" style=""width: 200px; height: 267px;"" /></p>

<p>Here is the aforementioned electric car in all it&#39;s beauty:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/rM5UFZ0.jpg"" style=""width: 140px; height: 105px;"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/4KNh8Ru.jpg"" style=""width: 196px; height: 147px;"" /></p>

<p>Like all recent Creator sets, this contemporary creation has plenty of furniture to go around:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/oWZTttP.jpg"" style=""width: 198px; height: 149px;"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/O11D7tR.jpg"" style=""width: 190px; height: 143px;"" /></p>

<p>A trampoline is always fun for a young child, and this 6x6-stud one is no exception:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/w3j1Q6D.jpg"" style=""width: 200px; height: 150px;"" /></p>

<p>Even the not-as-detailed side of the Modern Home is detailed, with pretty vines&nbsp;growing next to a drainpipe.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/NfvDKWc.jpg"" style=""width: 200px; height: 150px;"" /></p>

<p>Some neatly trimmed bushes accompany the sheltered front door:<br />
<img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/xml90fC.jpg"" style=""width: 200px; height: 150px;"" /></p>

<p>And what&#39;s more modern than a roof topped with solar panels?&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/vzgfBRE.jpg"" style=""width: 250px; height: 188px;"" /></p>

<p>But what if you want the sun to shine upon you as well? The opening hinge attached to it has got you covered. (Or uncovered)</p>

<h3>The minifigs</h3>

<p>This set has two minifigs; a mother and her son. They also have a cute pet dog and a helicopter with spinning blades.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/RMx48Oe.jpg"" style=""width: 230px; height: 173px;"" /></p>

<p>Their backs are detailed as well.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://i.imgur.com/wPov1HK.jpg"" style=""width: 260px; height: 195px;"" /></p>

<h3>Final Verdict</h3>

<p>For US $30, this set is an amazing deal. It is one of the first sets to put the groundbreaking Starter Base idea into the works. It is one of the first sets to be Modern-style and it does not disappoint. I recommend it 100%.</p>

Definitely worth the $30.00 price tag but,&nbsp;even a better deal at Walmart for $22.00, so much so i went back and got another set. My daughter thought it was so cool how you can interchange the elements to customize any way you want. She played with it all night. Not much for the dog, bird or RC helli. They never look like what there supposed to so we just add them to our extra pieces pile. Build was quick and fun, and easy to adapt the technique&nbsp;to our other builds. Bonus for the light brick which is a major plus.Great set!</p>

"ChromedCat","2020-11-23T03:57:02.79Z","Amazing Value, Amazing Fun ","<p>This set is one of the BEST value creator sets of recent times. With the price being only 30USD and 55Sgd, this set is filled with many details. Even though this set has the same footprint and volume as 31081 Modular Skate House, its $10 Usd cheaper!!</p>

<p>Honestly, the alternate builds in this set are pretty lazy as they all use different bases each leaving 1 base unused. I love the design of the house exterior and interior. I also had lots of fun rearranging&nbsp;the different modular components</p>

<p>I also like the parts included in this set like the many transparent pillars (7x) and doors (2x) and many others</p>

<p>The inclusion of the car is not necessary but welcome!</p>

<p>Overall, even at RRP, this set is worth picking up if you can still find it</p>

<p>10/10 set Highly Recommended</p>
