<h2><strong>Overall Rating</strong></h2>

<p>4/5. My 5 year old thoroughly enjoyed this build and he definitely had a sense of accomplishment that he was able to put the whole thing together himself.&nbsp; He chose to build just the main build first, so this review is based only on that one.</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>This was completed in about 15 minutes at a time over a couple of weeks which seemed to be perfect for my 5 year old.&nbsp; There may have been 1 or 2 times I helped, but I think he did almost everything without any guidance, so the build itself was not too complicated.&nbsp; There are however a few interesting techniques and enough variation to keep the build fresh.&nbsp; There is one bit that I found a little weird.&nbsp; Many of the windows, basketball hoop, etc. are only attached at the bottom so they come out easily.&nbsp; Honestly, it&#39;s unclear to me why they did that. It doesn&#39;t make the build any easier and they seem to get knocked out during play as well.&nbsp; -1 point for this!</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>Lots of white bricks which are useful, windows and door in a good dark tan color, and stairs are always useful.&nbsp; Plus lots of red roof pieces (which you can never have too many of), but not very many unique parts except the light brick.</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>Good playability for the kid who has 100 cars, but only 1 or 2 buildings.&nbsp; My son liked the garage door and squeezing the car in there.&nbsp; Plus the 3 figs, doghouse, brick built dog, basketball hoop, furnished interior, and light brick contribute towards a high playability score.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>Getting this one new on sale for $50 or gently used for around that price would probably be worth it.&nbsp; I wouldn&#39;t pay $70 for it though.&nbsp; Pretty good set overall!</p>
