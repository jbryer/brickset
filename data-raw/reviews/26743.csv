<p>Pros:</p>

<p>1. Nice stand-alone shuttle. The proportions are on the cute side but it works nicely with the minifig scale. The cockpit comes off easily to seat the minifig.</p>

<p>2. A brick built nose!! One of the reasons I passed up most of the recent Space Shuttle sets (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/3367-1/Space-Shuttle"">3367</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60078-1/Utility-Shuttle"">60078</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60080-1/Spaceport"">60080</a>, not counting the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10231-1/Shuttle-Expedition"">Shuttle Expedition sets</a> which were too expensive for me anyway) was the juniorised one-piece nose. It&#39;s very interesting to see this brick-built nose come together during the build, and somewhat shocking to recognise the transparent cockpit window piece as coming from the windscreen of Speed Champions vehicles!.</p>

<p>3. A brick-built tail as well!</p>

<p>4. Cool little EVA suit for the spaceman minifig and good that we get a transparent visor to see his determined expression. Together with the satellite and robotic arm, it makes for some enjoyable spacewalk play.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>1. Appreciate that the rear engines are tilted in their triangular configuration using some neat technic techniques but viewed from some angles the engines look a bit silly and exposed as there is nothing to hide the thin technic connectors. I don&#39;t own <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60080-1/Spaceport"">60080</a> Spaceport but the engines in that set look more satisfyingly solid.</p>

<p>2. The underside is a bit too flat for my liking. A few extra plates to give it a bit more underbelly volume would have been nice.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great set for any space and space shuttle lovers. Pretty good value for money. (The alternative builds don&#39;t really attract me but I guess I&#39;ll get around to them some time later).</p>

"HikerCZ","2017-06-18T19:46:48.027Z","Definitely not lost in space!","<p>I blame Saturn V for getting this set. With the news of the (absolutely stunning) Apollo 11 set my interest in the Space&nbsp;theme had been rebooted. I immediately started browsing through older space sets whetting my appetite to be ready for the&nbsp;&#39;big thing&#39; later this year. I even considered getting the juniorised version of the space shuttle from the previous space&nbsp;themed city line. Luckily Lego was thinking along the same lines and managed to release a new set to make the Space theme&nbsp;even more exciting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let me be perfectly honest with you. I enjoy the Creator line. I&#39;m not a regular collector but every now and then I&nbsp;treat myself to an interesting set and I&#39;m almost always positively surprised what I get for my money&#39;s worth. It&#39;s the&nbsp;same case here. I had seen the reviews before buying the shuttle but was surprised anyway. It&#39;s much nicer and&nbsp;larger than I&#39;d expected. 27x19 cm (almost 1 ft) of a solid, straightforward build which is not flimsy and looks fine from almost every angle.</p>

<p>As it is a Creator set, some compromises had to be made. I agree with the previous reviewer that&nbsp;some sections may seem a little bit underwhelming (mostly in details) but the overall impression is good&nbsp;in my opinion. I&nbsp;mean we get a brick-built nose and tail which look so much better than their&nbsp;large prefabricated counterparts; the cargo bay is&nbsp;big enough to carry the satellite and the EVA suit. If you leave the satellite and the telescopic arm out, you can fit in a&nbsp;decent amount of cargo for your space missions or a nice crew of astronauts travelling to your space station. It&#39;s pretty&nbsp;swooshable, the only soft spot being where the curved pieces meet in the middle.</p>

<p>Accessories seem somewhat limited, you get a satellite, a wrench, one astronaut - who is slightly different from the&nbsp;previous city line (wait for the secondary facial expression, it&#39;s priceless!). However, if you own any space sets, you&nbsp;can add, accessorise to your heart&#39;s desire. It&#39;s both a good play set for the kids and a lovely display piece for AFOLs (especially if you add a small stand or wheels).&nbsp;</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t tried the other builds, as my main focus was the shuttle. The station seems interesting enough though. I&#39;d&nbsp;recommend building it first because once you build your shuttle, I doubt you&#39;ll be willing to disassemble it. That&nbsp;was definitely my case.</p>

<p>Well done Lego, this is what combining creativity and play should be about without jacking the&nbsp;price up. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>i enjoyed the 3 builds a lot and settled on the shuttle itself as the final build. I am however keeping my eyes open for more of this set to eventually do all three builds, or maybe just build a fleet of shuttles.</p>

"Oregondete81","2018-07-03T15:49:42.44Z","Great Value Set","<p>This is a LEGO creator 3in1&nbsp;set. You can build the shuttle, mining lab, and a surface vehicle and the set comes with one spaceman minifig.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was a huge fan of LEGO as a kid, but hadn&#39;t bought a set or played with LEGO in well over a decade. I was feeling a bit nostalgic&nbsp;so I went out and bought myself a LEGO set. This set was a great value, especially with the multiple building possibilities. This was the most fun I&#39;ve had in awhile and this set was an amazing reintroduction. The shuttle is SO COOL! The vehicle was a lot of fun to build and&nbsp;left me with enough spare pieces to build a cool little attachment&nbsp;mine set-up. The mining lab was a cool scene as well. Overall for the value of this set, the playability, and the building options it was an Amazing set. If you are&nbsp;looking for an affordable option as a collector or parent&nbsp;I would highly recommend this set.&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/159315735@N03/shares/DSV9QN"" /></p>
