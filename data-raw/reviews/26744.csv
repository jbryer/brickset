"Haay","2017-07-05T10:17:02.023Z","Three excellent models in one","<p>As soon as I had seen the first photo of the box-art of this set and realised&nbsp;the window used for the Turbo Track Racer car is the&nbsp;<strong>same</strong>&nbsp;window used in the 10248 - Ferrari F40 model, I knew I had to have this set! And finally I could get it at a nice discount so I could start building it.</p>

<p>To save the best for last, I started by building the C-model: the Formula racing car. As is usually the case with 3-in-1 sets the most LEGO parts are used in the A-model, and the least are used in the C-model. Sometimes that makes the C-model feel a bit like an afterthought, but in this case the Formula racing is a really nice model. It looks finished and could actually have been a stand-alone LEGO set&nbsp;all by itself, in my opinion.</p>

<p>The B-model is the Forklift Truck. This model has a functional (albeit manual) fork to lift and lower the crate with a model of a car&nbsp;engine on it. The truck itself looks quite good and the building experience was really nice. Some excellent SNOT techniques were used and interesting uses of the provided parts were made as well. The back-lid of the truck can be opened to reveal the truck&#39;s engine which is a nice detail. The play feature here is the forklift which can be locked in the upwards position to transport the provided crate from one place to another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And finally after having taken apart the Forklift Truck I could start building on the Turbo Track Racer. Even though this set is considerably cheaper than the Creator Expert (branded) cars the building experience is quite similar! The same advanced building techniques are used to great effect. And the result is spectacular! Though the two&nbsp;seater sports car is at a slightly smaller scale than the Ferrari F40, it still fits quite well in the series of Creator Expert cars that started with the Volkswagen T1 Camper Van. The gull-wing doors are operated by pulling the rear spoiler backwards, which is undeniably cool. The rear window can be opened to reveal the engine in the back, and the hood can be opened to show some luggage space and two included tools.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an AFOL and collector of Creator Expert cars (amongst others) I am really happy with this set. It looks great, was a pleasure to build, and at three nice models in one set it&#39;s excellent value for money!</p>

"adkj","2017-12-20T21:23:46.153Z","A more fun 1/18 scale model","<p>I&#39;m glad I built the Turbo Track Racer even though I bought it for the parts. The model reminds me of my metal die-cast cars I collected as a child.</p>

<p>Starting with the exterior, the size and proportions of the car are the same as 1/18 die-cast models and includes a similar amount of detail. In the front there is a radiator, headlights, fog lights, and even front and side indicator lights. Around the back of the car I really like the rear diffuser, four exhausts, and correct lights which include reversing lights, tail lights, and indicator lights. Another detail worth mentioning is the wheel insert. Because of the way the insert is separate from the wheel, it looks like there are disc brakes mounted in the wheels. The wheels themselves turn smoothly and with surprisingly little friction.</p>

<p>Continuing the die-cast similarities, the LEGO build has opening rear engine cover and front trunk. The engine is detailed even showing a V configuration, probably a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V4_engine"">V4</a>. In the front trunk there is a fire extinguisher, good thing to have on track day, and a wrench, also useful on a track day. The doors are better than on die-cast models because they open via a mechanism connected to the rear spoiler. Yes, it&#39;s not accurate but it is fun. There are also great interior details, including handbrake, gear lever, instrument cluster, and a stereo. The seats resemble proper racing buckets and there are hints of a roll cage in the car. So yes, I like this model quite a bit, but like I said at the start, that&#39;s not why I bought it. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I bought this car for the parts.The <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/arvobrothers/"" target=""_blank"">Porsche 911 Targa MOC set</a> needed the <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=19212&amp;C=13#T=S&amp;C=13&amp;O={%22color%22:13,%22iconly%22:0}"">tapered windscreen</a> and in 2017 this is the only set that has it. There are also 12 blue tile pieces and probably the largest number of black bracket pieces I&#39;ve ever seen with 15 included. It will take quite a while to collect the rest of the parts for the Porsche, so I&#39;m glad the Turbo Track Racer is such an attractive model to stand on my desk.</p>

"j_d","2019-01-18T14:53:13.613Z","Turbo Track Fun","<p>This Is a nice set. I think that it is worth the cost.</p>

<p>The door function works smoothly&nbsp;and the seats are very nice.</p>

<p>Most of my relatives that have seen it say that it is really nice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My cousins like playing with it and watching the doors open and close.</p>

<p>The only thing about it that I don&#39;t really like is that it is kind of fragile and you need to be careful</p>

<p>when carrying it.</p>

<p>This set is very detailed.</p>
