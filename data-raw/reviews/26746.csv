It&rsquo;s one of the few remaining sets to discuss and it&rsquo;s fairly impressive for what it is. LEGO began implementing new ideas with the Theme, but we&rsquo;ll get to that when we reach the model section of the review.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: It&rsquo;s a large box for such a relatively small set, and this set is on the smaller side as far as buildings go since a fair number of the pieces are used towards a vehicle build for Batgirl. The images on the front and back show off the set perfectly though as is often the case with LEGO packaging, the economy of space used is a bit unfortunate, but sometimes we expect that sort of thing from this particular price range of sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: As is usual with these sets the manual is made out of thick paper stock allowing for security and ensuring that the manual will not be folded, creased or bent when put into the box. That&rsquo;s the theory anyway, part of the cover and the first few pages were actually bent on my copy of the manual due to the placement of the numbered bags inside the box.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Other than that issue though there is nothing else to report, it&rsquo;s a solid easy to follow along with manual.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Being a set with Minidolls this set has a lot of fun colours for the elements which come in traditionally standard colours in regular LEGO System sets. Or at least it would be if LEGO hadn&rsquo;t started using such colours in other sets since first introducing them. In the case of this particular set though you&rsquo;ll find a lot of grey and dark blue elements, as well as some yellow. There are also two large single piece wall elements in a nice light purple colour, one of them is the standard 1x4 wall piece while the other is a ridged pattern design 1x4 wall element.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">You&rsquo;ll also find some of the new macaroni elements in this set. One or two of them in a very dark metallic silver. A veritable fount of useful parts for MOC fans and great for building the model in the set as well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minidolls</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Batgirl: At first glance you might assume this is just the same Batgirl Mini-Doll from the Batjet Chase set and you would be wrong. This one is dressed in a completely different colour scheme, wearing purple colored pants and top, her wings and head piece are the same, but her facial print has a different mask painted on with green colour highlights around the eyes.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">For accessories she includes hand cuffs, a batarang and a grapple hook to slide down on.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bat-Bot: This is a cute little assistant built with some simple LEGO elements and a printed transparent dome piece with a cute bat mask on the front. 1x1 plates with clips act as a hands and an old Exo-Force droid hand is used so he (or she) can grip the control for the spy periscope located on the bunker&rsquo;s third level.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Mad Harriet: Another member of Apokalypses Furies, this Mini-Doll features some nice zebra striped printing on her top and black stripes on her silver boots to match. She is using a single claw accessory as a weapon and has a wind-swept looking green hair piece to match with her green skirt. Batgirl can arrest her with handcuffs. Overall it&rsquo;s nice to have her so she can team up with Lashina from the first assortment.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kryptomite: This buildable menace is green, every build so far for this Theme has been unique and I definitely find each one thrilling and the spare 1x1 tile with face print elements you get in these sets means you can bricklink yourself some more matching parts to build your own configurations of Kryptomites and have an entire army for the heroes to fight against.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Batgirl and Mad Harriet start building the bunker together in this numbered bag. It&rsquo;s a fairly quick build with easily followed along steps and nothing too extraordinary when it comes to techniques. A small section of the computer monitoring area and play feature is built and there are not too many stickers to be applied&hellip; In fact I believe only one sticker is used for the 1x2 wall element for the computer monitoring screens.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: A Kryptomite and Batgirl&rsquo;s robotic drone are built here as well the next two stories of the bunker and the large entrance for Batgirl&rsquo;s prison transport van. This is adding on to the existing build from bag one so there&rsquo;s not a lot of problems in the building. More stickers get applied to certain elements, the archway with the bridge elements is built up and that&#39;s pretty much it. Simple, straight forward and shouldn&rsquo;t take longer than a half hour at most depending on the age of the builder.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: This final build is for Batgirl&rsquo;s vehicle included in this set. As I recall it had the most pieces in its bag due to their smaller nature when working to build the van up. More plates and tiles and things. It&rsquo;s a fairly straight forward build with very little difficulty, there is a single sticker to be applied and that&rsquo;s about it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Batgirl&rsquo;s Bunker: The bunker includes a lot of potential play elements. It&rsquo;s relatively small, however it features some nice mechanics. The lowest floor is a sealed box, it can open revealing some stickers for detailing and a storage area for Batgirl&rsquo;s accessories and special wing-cape. The windows are all transparent purple elements and the large door on the bottom can be opened with a push lever raising it up so Batgirl can sneak inside.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Stored in there is a computer chip of some sort, which is the focus of the conflict as Mad Harriet and her Kryptomite ally are after this computer chip. The second floor of the bunker can be reached by a small ladder build into the side of the wall; on top is a jumper plate where you can store a work out bench with purple barbell (really just a LEGO train wheel element.) and a punching bag hangs down. Batgirl can get in fighting shape.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Her robot companion Bat-Bot mans a lookout periscope on the third level which can be rotated using the punching bag on level two. Off to the side is a large archway, perhaps leading into a hidden parking space, as the barrier in front can be raised up and Batgirl can rush out driving her transport van.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">One final play element to mention is a new idea that the second wave seems to have incorporated. Zipline functions, attaching a thin bendy plastic element onto a post on the top of the bunker and a post on the van can allow Batgirl to slide down the flexible element with a hook accessory, this can be changed if you own more sets. Lena Luthor&rsquo;s Kryptomite Lab, this set and Harley to the Rescue can be put together and attached with the flexible rubbery element on the 1x2 plates with posts dotting the roof sections of each model. One of the flexible elements is included in the Bumblebee Helicopter set if you prefer to add it in as the back of the instructions demonstrate.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It&rsquo;s a really solid play feature and I&rsquo;m impressed they designed all of these models to fit together on the shelf as a small little Super Hero Girls section of a city.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Batgirl&rsquo;s Transport: This vehicle looks like a chunky van, it&rsquo;s big and definitely armored for defense. Batgirl fits inside the driver&rsquo;s compartment easily and the back contains a prison restraining area for villainess Mad Harriet. This van is also decked out with two yellow fin pieces or batwings and rotational axels allowing you to adopt a hovering/flight mode for quick travel. It&rsquo;s a fun model to play with and is designed to match Batgirl&rsquo;s personality quite well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It is a crying shame that LEGO failed to pick off with this theme because honestly I think I prefer some of its design cues over the regular DC based theme. Mostly in the fact that we get far more buildings and scenery instead of just more mecha and bat vehicles. It would be nice if they took the ideas from this theme and folded them into the regular theme so we could have the likes of Penguin&rsquo;s Lounge, Gotham Police Department, a Cape hang out spot such as a detailed Hall of Justice and many more buildings than just more and more vehicles.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is one I&rsquo;d definitely recommend tracking down if you wanted to populate some more Gotham City areas in your display. Even if the aesthetics are not quite matching they are certainly worth having for scenery and the like. So ultimately I highly recommend this set.</p>
