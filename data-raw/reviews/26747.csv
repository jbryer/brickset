This set is the largest I own so far and features some nice details and play features.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: This is a massive box, some might argue it&rsquo;s a little too large compared to what you get since there is a lot of empty space inside once you get it open. However the design is very nice with the rest of the DC Super Hero Girls theme and really stands out as unique compared to the other Mini-Doll lines. The images on the front and back truly capture the set nicely and exceptionally well and the artwork is a wonderful touch for this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: Much as with the other larger sets I&rsquo;ve reviewed from the Theme this manual is on a thicker card stock bound much like a paperback novel allowing for somewhat easier flipping of pages, unfortunately this also makes keeping the manuals open so you can actually read the pages can be tricky during the early moments of the build. Overall though I think I prefer this style of manual, it has a much harder time being bent or creased during the packing process. It&rsquo;s probably more expensive though hence why LEGO rarely uses it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set features a lot of common parts found in the Mini-Doll themed sets from LEGO. Mostly a few lime green and bright orange elements, however you&rsquo;ll also find some large dark purple slide parts if you&rsquo;re looking to make some colorful slides in your MOCs. It&rsquo;s a pretty solid parts list for a set of this type.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minidolls</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Lena Luthor: Wearing a dark green and purple suit Lena looks a lot like her brother Lex in his Kryptonite armor, she has no accessories to hold, but that isn&rsquo;t too bad as you can have her hold the stolen computer chip from Batgirl that comes in the set. Overall she looks highly menacing and her hairpiece is a unique colour a dark yellow blonde almost orange.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Supergirl: Dressed in a blue suit Supergirl is trying to protect herself from the Kryptonite this time&hellip; She looks a lot more like Superman too when she&rsquo;s wearing her blue suit, especially with the red boots and blue pants look she has. She includes a red cape or a blue cape, remove these if you leave her inside the speedboat as they will bend when she&rsquo;s sitting down for long periods of time.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kryptomites: You get three of them in this set, one common green, one purple and the other a light blue in colour. All three are built very similarly and yet each one has a unique looking face. Overall some great little monsters to build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Krypto: This unique element was available in a cheaper Polybag which I already reviewed, this creature is therefore not unique to the set or changed from the previous set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 1: With the first bag you get to construct two speedboats alongside Supergirl and Lena, one of which is much larger than the other due to the nature of the set. There are a few minor sticker placements, but nothing else to worry about.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 2: The first level of the factory is constructed with this first bag, which is a very nice build. Again there is minor sticker placement for details, building anything for Mini-Dolls usually involves a lot of nice detailing and for the most part there is little exception here. The lowest level includes a small jail cell for Supergirl and a hidden speedboat dock with a launching gimmick as part of the build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 3: The second floor involves even more fun little detailing as you build Lena&rsquo;s tiny lab. Again you&rsquo;ll be using stickers for the detailing, you also get to build the large slide section which is a part of the play features in this set. It&rsquo;s a fun and quick build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 4: And here we finish the build with the third floor which features a small prison tube for Krypto, a little launching doorway for the Kryptomites and an extra section of the main building with a stud shooter on it which can be manned by Kryptomites. It&rsquo;s another quick build and fairly decent. Definitely enjoyed all of the building in this set and I&rsquo;m sure younger fans will be thrilled as they get to make a large playset to interact and have fun with once finished.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kryptomite Factory: This factory is a solid model and three levels of fun action and excitement. On the first level, as I mentioned, there is a small jail cell that can hold Supergirl. The set includes some Kryptonite crystals to weaken the heroine before Lena captures her. Beside the cell is where you can store a speedboat, Supergirl&rsquo;s to be precise, and launch it with a simple Technic axle joint push lever that launches the boat towards a small wall build that easily pops off when Supergirl is escaping.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The second level has a decently stocked lab for Lena, she has a microscope, a computer screen for monitoring Krypto and a spot to stash the computer chip her Kryptomites&rsquo; stole from Batgirl&rsquo;s Bunker. (The 1x1 printed tile is the same element seen in that set.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The third level includes a small tube dungeon for draining Krypto of energy which can house the canine piece and a tipping box of some sort which triggers the creation of another Kryptomite as it is launched from the top and drops down the slide to the bottom into a crate. This crate can be attached to Lena&rsquo;s speedboat by a small chain and she can dash off with it and her newly created minions when Supergirl manages to escape.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The smaller side-build just features a little archway with a stud shooter on top. It clips on via a clip brick to a LEGO bar element and is easily removed, far too easy, I recommend not picking this up to move it without first remembering to grab the smaller element at the same time otherwise it&rsquo;ll fall on the floor and break apart quite easily. Overall the entire model is very impressive and quite fun to play with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Speedboats: Lena&rsquo;s speedboat is pretty small, but works well for the type of model you build to play with. Supergirl has a massive speedboat with two stud shooters on the side to fire at Lena in an attempt to prevent her escape. Overall some great looking models to add to the playability of the set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I firmly believe this Theme was short changed by LEGO, it may not have sold the best, but it has a lot of great models and ideas behind it and the Mini-Dolls are top notch representations of the DC Super Hero Girls. It was just unfortunate that you didn&rsquo;t get a lot of male characters in the sets, or even the entire roster of characters we got to see in the animated specials that were made to coincide with the Theme. If you can still locate any of these for a decent price I wholeheartedly recommend them. They have great builds, great play features and look great once all put together on a shelf if you&rsquo;re into displaying your LEGO instead of playing with it. Highly recommended.</p>
