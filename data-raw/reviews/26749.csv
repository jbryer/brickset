<br />
This was actually the first set I bought on returning to LEGO after 15-20 years.&nbsp; Mostly because I thought the flames coming out the back of the chariot were pretty awesome.</p>

<p>As far as the set, we have Azari, our fire elf, speeding along on her mission (which, looking at later sets, is apparently the resuce of Sophie).&nbsp; The goblin antagonist tries to stop her with some nasty carnivorous plants, but no worries, Azari has a crossbow that shoots fire discs!</p>

<p>As a former KFOL returning now as an AFOL, I&#39;m impressed by all the moving parts (chomping plants, working crossbow!, and flames that move in and out).&nbsp; I also like these new, more lifelike minifigs.&nbsp; The diversity of skintones on them is also a plus.&nbsp; I&#39;m given to understand they are only in the Friends and Elves sets, which is a shame.&nbsp; I&#39;d like to see more of them.<br />
<br />
Overall, a really great set.&nbsp; It was enough to get me back into LEGO and hooked on the Elves line, so, yea.</p>
