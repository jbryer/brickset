<p>Rosalyn&#39;s Healing Hideout offers six characters, four new, and a unique Dark Blue-barked treehouse. Any Elves fan looking to collect all the characters, whether elves, dragons, or goblins, will need to snatch this set up.</p>

<p>The box and instructions come with the usual colorful Elves fanfare decorating them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bag 1 contains the two carts and the plant monster, plus Naida, Rimlin, and Lula figs.</p>

<p>Bag 2 contains the parts for Sapphire.</p>

<p>Bags 3 and 4 contain the parts for the hideout and Rosalyn fig.</p>

<h3>Minifigs/Characters</h3>

<p>This set contains two new minidoll characters&nbsp;and one old:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Rosalyn&nbsp;Nightshade, a Water Elf</li>
	<li>Rimlin, a yellow Goblin</li>
	<li>Naida&nbsp;Riverheart, a Water Elf</li>
</ul>

<p>It also contains two character figurines and one new brick-built dragon:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sapphire, a Dark Blue and Light Aqua Water Dragon</li>
	<li>Lula, a Light Aqua and Trans Dark Pink Baby Dragon</li>
	<li>Lil Blu, a baby blue Bear</li>
</ul>

<p>Naida has her 2016 hair and head and 2017 torso and legs, which look fairly similar to her 2016 outfit (2015 is much more distinct), giving dragon collectors who have both this set and Water Dragon Adventure (41172-1) two similar Naida&nbsp;dolls.</p>

<p>Lil Blu is identical to his appearance in the Evil Dragon (41183-1) set, which is unfortunate. I think this was a missed opportunity to include a different animal creature, or at least not the same one as in the other 2017 dragon set.</p>

<p>Rosalyn is a new minidoll exclusive to this set. She matches her treehouse, Sapphire, and Lula very well with her Dark Blue and Light Aqua outfit and Magenta accents. She has a gold crown that can be affixed to her hair.</p>

<p>Rimlin is a yellow and purple Goblin exclusive to this set. He has a very cheeky grin and a detailed front outfit. Like the other Goblins his back is unpainted.</p>

<p>Sapphire is a new brick-built Water Dragon. She has a few changes from the other small Dragons, Thorne and Merina, but her overall build is similar. Her color scheme is Dark Blue, Light Aqua, and Magenta/Trans Pink. Overall she is very well coordinated, but it is extremely unfortunate we did not get a Zonya/Gust-sized Water Dragon in this set.</p>

<p>Lula is a Baby Dragon in the same mold as the rest of the Elves Baby Dragons, also exclusive to this set. She has a Light Aqua body with Trans Dark Pink wings/spines/belly, which makes her look somewhat similar to Miku.</p>

<p>This set comes with four new 2017 Elves characters and a new version of Naida, making it an extremely good purchase for anyone collecting characters. It completes your dragon collection with both Sapphire and Lula.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The instructions have you start with Bag 1: Rimlin&#39;s cart and evil plant and Naida&#39;s cart. This bag goes by quickly. The Rimlin and Naida dolls can both grab their carts and pull them around. The plant can grab Lula when she goes for the treat, which works surprisingly well to actually grab her.</p>

<p>Bag 2 builds Sapphire, in addition to the wings that come loose in the box (a third wing is included). You will need the sticker sheet for Sapphire, just like all the other dragons. She has four for her feet and two for her tail. Her head&#39;s upper jaw comes with painted-on details, again like the other dragons.</p>

<p>Sapphire is, disappointingly, one of the teen-sized dragons. After already getting a teen Water Dragon in Merina it is a shame LEGO didn&#39;t give a larger-sized Water Dragon. Ashwing, Sapphire&#39;s former friend, is larger than her, perhaps explaining why one had to be smaller. Her build goes by very quickly and the bag almost doesn&#39;t seem to have enough pieces, especially after building Ashwing.</p>

<p>Sapphire has a few unique details: she has a small second set of wings in Light Aqua attached to her wings where the gems usually go on the others. She is also a two-seater dragon like Zonya and Elandra, which is very interesting considering she is not as long as Zonya, that two seats fit. This is at the expense of the more natural, sloped back that Merina, Zonya and Gust have. Sapphire additionally has a stud to place Lula on at the back of her saddle (like Gust), letting her ride around with Rosalyn and Naida securely. Due to their color combinations, Sapphire and Lula look better paired together than any other dragon combo.</p>

<p>A couple things could have been better about her build, besides her size. Her tail tip is similar to Elandra&#39;s but for some reason leaves the bottom of the 1x1 4-sided stud brick on the bottom of her tail, meaning a trans pink gem cannot be placed on it. I wish the designers had just copied Elandra&#39;s tail which looks much better. Her feet use slopes on the underside instead of the round pieces Zonya, Thorne and Merina use or the flat pieces of Gust, Elandra&nbsp;and Ashwing. This makes her a bit awkward to stand as she doesn&#39;t have that much surface area to put weight on. She stands fine, but is tippier than the others. Her chest area is a let-down compared to the other dragons and looks underwhelming. Her Light Aqua mini-wings use grey wrenches to attach to the Dark Blue wings which look out of place.</p>

<p>Sapphire has a solid amount of articulation including three total points in her tail, a high mobility of angles in her wings (like Merina due to only a single Technic pin attachment), an actual neck joint (like Merina and unlike Thorne), and the usual leg and foot joints. She is very cute with her small stature and can be posed very well. After building six other dragons, though, her build is a bit boring, especially compared to fellow 2017 entrant, Ashwing.</p>

<p>Bags 3 and 4 will build the treehouse hideaway. 3 is the main structure and all the base while 4 mostly adds detail to the upper level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I found the treehouse to be much sturdier of a build than the castle and lava setup in Queen Dragon&#39;s Rescue (41179-1). It falls apart way less and the links between the bottom plates are much stronger. The treehouse uses the rest of the stickers included in the set to add some detail work like the blue cross on the upper level - not mandatory but they look good.</p>

<p>There is a little pond on the treehouse&#39;s right including a very cute lily pad. The rest of the base is green grass including some pumpkins on the left and crystals in the center. My only complaint is the water area, much like the water area in the Water Dragon Adventure build, feels very small. There&#39;s no room to attach a water creature or have the elves &#39;splash around&#39; when playing. There is a secret hiding place for Rosalyn&#39;s crown on the water side that looks very nice.</p>

<p>Building up involves a lot of Dark Blue pieces to make a Dark Blue tree. The hideout is well decorated and looks like a livable space. It falls short on Bag 4, which leaves a lot of the back of the upper level empty. I don&#39;t understand why the branch on the back-left side of the treehouse wasn&#39;t duplicated on the back-right side, or at least something put there. The gold fence in front and bed look nice but then the back half looks terribly incomplete outside of the potion shelf.</p>

<p>The treehouse&#39;s&nbsp;hiding branches move very well, and though they probably won&#39;t actually hide a tree with golden fencing, move in front of the upper level to &#39;block&#39; it pretty well. They move to the side to reveal the upper level and can be posed at whatever angle you choose.</p>

<p>Overall the treehouse was a fun build that looks unique due to the use of Dark Blue. It fits in with the general Elves scheme thanks to the purple and pink leaves and trans-pink accessories.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>While I just display my dragon collection, a child could have a lot of fun with this set. Rimlin provides an antagonist along with his plant and Sapphire&#39;s degree of posability&nbsp;lets a child take her on many adventures. The hiding feature of the treehouse&nbsp;is very cool as well and there are a lot of small accessories in it to play with.</p>

<p>The carts will add to the range of things a child can do by having Naida and Rimlin tug their carts around, but I personally would have rather left them out and given the piece count there to Sapphire instead. Yes they wheel around well but they have a lot of loose pieces meant to go on/in them which can get lost in your carpet easily while your child is playing.</p>

<p>The same goes for the cauldron on the treehouse. Maybe I am just old now but I much rather have a way to secure all the pieces in the sets down so they don&#39;t get lost. Still, a child would have fun with the loose pieces, and extras are provided for when your vacuum inevitably eats a couple.</p>

<p>Anyone who has one of the Goblin-themed sets could act out the main characters fleeing from the Goblins and finding Rosalyn. This set definitely has a lot of value to a child who wants to play. As an adult, I just wish it had been cheaper to buy Sapphire and Lula.</p>

<h3>Parts and Value</h3>

<p>This set comes with 460 pieces including five character figures (three you can only get in this set)&nbsp;and Sapphire&#39;s head/wings, plus a lot of nice Dark Blue. I definitely like the assortment of parts involved and they all tie in very well to each other and the general Elves look.</p>

<p>However, for $49.99, this set is over $.10 a piece, and for how small Sapphire is, I wouldn&#39;t say I feel like I got my money&#39;s worth buying this set at full price. When this set gets discounted it will be a great buy.</p>

<p>For anyone looking to get all the Elves minidolls/dragons/Goblins, though, this set offers four exclusives, making it a must-buy. Children will love playing with it as they get a fun treehouse&nbsp;which is larger than most of the play pieces that come with the dragons and Sapphire to fly around on.</p>

<p>Some design elements could have been done better and this set is probably better purchased in a couple months once discounted, but overall I enjoyed building it and got what I wanted out of it - Sapphire and Lula to complete my dragon set.</p>
