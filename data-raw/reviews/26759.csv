"AddictedToStyrene","2017-06-01T01:45:43.343Z","Driving up to the snow","<p>This is a great little Friends set and the smallest one in the 2017 Snow Resort theme. The set contains Emma on a snowboard, with a small snow &#39;ramp&#39; and a very nice off-road vehicle. In fact the vehicle is the star of the set, something that&#39;s a little hidden by the action scene on the box front.</p>

<p>Emma is wearing winter clothes, a purple and dark blue sweater with aqua gloves, and light aqua pants with dark pink boots. Her head is a standard mould, and her helmet is a softer rubber piece combining aqua helmet and black pony tail. She also has white Star Wars style ski goggles which click on to the helmet (spare provided as usual). This outfit will go very nicely with the Friends figures from advent calendars, and of course the other sets in the Snow Resort sub-theme.</p>

<p>Emma comes with a lime green snowboard, which is decorated with a small &#39;snowflake&#39; sticker (but of a seven sided snowflake. Copyright reasons?) and&nbsp;a map of ski runs printed on a white 2 x 2 tile. The map is in bright Friends colours, but with no writing, so it could be useable in other themes.</p>

<p>The vehicle is a neat Land Rover style four wheel drive, in dark blue with lime green and dark pink accents. It is six studs wide, plus wheel arches. It builds up from a 4 x 12 plate with a second layer of 1 x 4 and 1 x 6 plates, topped with an assortment of bricks to form the body. The wheels are standard old style city wheels on 2 x 2 axle plates, with larger off road&nbsp;tyres. Looked at from the side, it seems like the axles are too close together. This exactly matches the look of other Friends cars but might make people want to modify the set for&nbsp;minifigure use.</p>

<p>The car does not have opening doors, but there is a working&nbsp;tailgate, opening to a space big enough to stow the included suitcase and much more gear. The roof is made from two 4 x 6 curved wedges, and is topped by a roof rack and jumper plate to secure the snowboard. The snowboard fits into the cargo area too but might fall out during play. As usual, you remove the roof to access the inside, which can make the car windows a bit fragile in a small child&#39;s hands but it&#39;s fine for the intended age group.</p>

<p>Another snowflake sticker can go on the front of the car, and a larger sticker can decorate the rear door. The car looks fine with or without them and they are easy to apply. There are two special 1 x 2 panel tiles for holding Friends figures by the feet in the car; these could be replaced with more plates to seat&nbsp;minifigures.</p>

<p>The ramp is nice for a small scenery piece because it is semi-functional. No moving parts but the white slope pieces and the yellow tile and half arch mean there is somewhere for a kid to play with Emma when she is on her snow board. There is a green flag piece which takes another sticker and some vegetation pieces&nbsp;for an outdoorsy feel.</p>

<p>The part selection is very good, with some nice windows, tiles, slopes and curves in dark blue and plates in lime green.&nbsp;There are a lot of colours in this set but between the vehicle and Emma&#39;s outfit they all tie in nicely. The building techniques are very good for a set this size: not too complex or fiddly like some recent small Town sets and not a monster four wheel drive like a lot of licensed sets.&nbsp;The stickers are nice and not mandatory. My only criticisms are that the vehicle looks a bit compressed compared with similar sets in the Town theme - but it is exactly right compared with other Friends cars - and that the snowflakes have seven sides.</p>

<p>The final word is that my girls love this set.</p>
