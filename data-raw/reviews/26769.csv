<p>A good example of an average set. Nothing bad, but nothing amazing also.</p>

<p>Parts are good and pricing is ok due to the pieces being from Juniors. Playability comes mostly from the Shark Car, which is a cool build, and the motorcycle. The building experience was cool due to the Shark Car.</p>
