I was a bit sceptical about it, but went along with the decision. When the set arrived we both were surprised at how huge the box was. It contained a good amount of plates and bags of parts, as well as a building instructions booklet. We knew at this point that the kids would like it. Yet, the fun they had with it exceeded our expectations. Our nieces (3 and 8 year old) were very impressed with the set and put it together right away. They had hours of fun playing with it together with our 1-year-old daughter. It was cool to see how the fairground bridged their age gap and all of the girls found something engaging in it to play together. The barn train and the carousel were the most fun structures to play with. For some curious reason, however, the girls were most excited about the toilet and the balloons. I would guess they represented items that they often encountered and interacted with in their daily life. The 1-year-old enjoyed the carousel horses the most.</p>

<p>I am not certain that this set would be as interesting to boys due to its over-the-top candy colours, girls fun focus, and reliance on specialised pieces (it feels like a junior Friends set). However, I can say it was a huge success with these three girls and made us very happy as a family.</p>
