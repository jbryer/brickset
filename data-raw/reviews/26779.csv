But this is the set that has gotten her interested in Legos. Why? Well let&rsquo;s just say her life revolves around pandas and Minnie Mouse and this set includes the latter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It comes with instructions for building the bow-tique&nbsp;which are way beyond her comprehension. But she understands that she can ask me or her brother to build it for her. Of course my main concern is that since they are just a normal Lego instruction manual and not something sturdier, eventually she will destroy it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set includes many of the 1x2x2&nbsp;bricks which are very easy for young children to hold and put together, and 4 of them are translucent blue which I&rsquo;ve found both my kids tend to gravitate towards. Of course you have Minnie and Daisy who make the set so much fun for her. But you also have the coo coo bird who is fun to play with. And most importantly, you have a fabric blanket which my daughter loves using to put Minnie and Daisy to sleep with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have a Minnie Mouse obsessed 2 year old, there is no better set to get her.&nbsp;</p>
