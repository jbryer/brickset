"QWERTY2005","2017-07-14T14:57:20.56Z","Extra set","<p>I am very happy with this set. Nice bus, many mini figurines, cool accessories for my city, here is one of the few wheelchairs. There are also apples, dog since 2011 and two bikes for ordinary people. Cool that there is a bench at the bus stop, you can play at the retired or ... on the children waiting for the bus.</p>

"dafish","2017-10-23T12:07:30.587Z","Best bus and bus stop ever","<p>The set is worth every cent you spend, as judged from the building experience, from its authenticity as well as from its playability and match with other city sets. First of all, the bus is by far the best bus from among all previous sets. It resembles strongly some busses (including the new hybrids) used in the city of Copenhagen, even by its coloration. A perfect replica, in particular with respect to the double rear axles, rendering the bus a heavy appearance. The news stand features the minimum required, however, it is nicely designed and offers the usual service including sodas and fresh apples. The lantern comes in a new assembly with unusual parts. The bus stop itself has some downsides - albeit nicely decorated - because the ramp for handicapped access to the bus is directed towards a somewhat pointless angle. If applied properly, it would move the stop itself in a 90 degree angle from the bus and road direction which is unusual for a bus stop (even in Copenhagen!). The ramp can be easily assembled in a 90 degree rotation so it fits the bus access but maintain the stop alongside the curb. The bus stop would also benefit from a rear wall, which can not be easily added to the set. The minifigs are a nice mix of old and young and are unique among city minifigs. Putting the set together is a one-hour entertaining experience! Overall, a highly recommended set if you aim at building a realistic city!</p>

"BuildTheBrick","2018-05-04T12:53:20.493Z","Right alongside Fun in the Park.","<p>This almost seems to classify what Fun in the Park is missing, a bus, you know how to take our money LEGO, unfortunately for us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Bus</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hmm, not exactly the favorite part of the set, you kinda have to get your fingers inside to get the roof off, through the door. Seating, not much better, room for one wheelchair despite the fact that if this is supposed to go alongside Fun in the Park it should have space for two. It also has the only hint in the set that fun in the park should go with it. On one of the doors. The color scheme is good, but I think when they made the molding for the set, the roof anti-studs were given too much clutch power, well, maybe they fixed the molding after the first wave. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Newspaper Stand&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ah yes, the newspaper stand, unlike the main build this lives up to its name. It has a Recycling bin that looks more like a compost bin judging by the provided contents.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Bus &quot;Station&quot; Stop</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>OK, LEGO misnamed the whole set because of this, it is a bus STOP LEGO, STOP! Anyway, this part has some&nbsp;sitting area for the five minifigs&nbsp;while&nbsp;they wait for the bus. And a proper recycling box.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>All in all</b>&nbsp;an OK set. The six minifigs and one dog are a good addition to any city.</p>
