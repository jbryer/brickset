I may still inevitably get one, depending on if any discounts are offered, but until then let&rsquo;s take a look at my first LEGO City Advent Calendar offering.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Box</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">LEGO City Advent Calendar&rsquo;s aren&rsquo;t as colorful as LEGO Friends, but this City Box design is still highly enjoyable. Granted you see many of the models being offered on the outside of the box, so you aren&rsquo;t really surprised by what you&rsquo;ll find. However compared to a certain competitor&rsquo;s foray into the Advent Calendar release which I recently experienced the LEGO boxes are ten times sturdier and better designed.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">There&rsquo;s nice imagery on the back as well demonstrating how to enjoy the Advent Calendar experience, and LEGO Santa has a small checklist of other LEGO City sets from this year you may like for your presents.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The box flap/interior detailing shows a nice festive little winter scene with a large window showing off the outside and a half-inside, half-outside floor plan to place all of your 24 gifts. Overall a very nice box design.</span></span></span></span></p>

As this is my first LEGO City Calendar I shall endeavor to be as thorough as possible.</span></span></span></span></p>

I&rsquo;ve seen toy train designs in LEGO before and they aren&rsquo;t often as involved as this one, here the build involves a good fifteen pieces and makes a fairly lengthy looking Minifigure scale toy train, not steam powered, but certainly not a bullet train design either.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Day 2:</span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;""> Well here&rsquo;s Minifigure number one, snowboarding child, boy or girl, though I suspect it is meant to be a boy. This is a nice looking minifig, he&rsquo;s got the green winter jacket which is printed on both sides of the torso, short blue legs (which I believe are the same tone and colour as Bart Simpson&rsquo;s legs), a grey helmet and an orange snowboard complete the look&hellip; his face is standard fare from LEGO City.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Putting him next to the toy train from day one we find, that is one big model train, it&rsquo;s got to be at least advanced model fare. Not much else to say, he&rsquo;s a great looking first offering and will be perfect for your Winter Village display.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Day 3:</span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;""> Well, well, well, it&rsquo;s the third day and after playing in the snow for hours our little Snowboarder has the chance to warm himself by the small fireplace built today. This model is very familiar looking, the overall design I feel I&rsquo;ve seen in past advent calendars, the colours are different, they&rsquo;re darker in tone compared to a LEGO Friends set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">You get three mason bricks, four sloped bricks, some flame elements, a few bar pieces 1x2 plates with bar parts used for the mantle in pearl gold and three 1x4 plates to help hold everything together. Overall a small fireplace design, however it&rsquo;s fairly cute, compact and cozy looking. Pretty good offering today.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Day 4:</span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;""> Today you can sit beside your fireplace in a nice red chair with a little lamp and Christmas tree decoration. Comparing this to similar ideas in the LEGO Friends range I have to say this little model is not as detailed as it could be. However it does make for a nice little seating area for Minifigures, and adds further to the cozy, compact nature of the models.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I do wish that the chair was elevated on a 2x4 brick though, the side-table with the lamp and festive tree decoration looks particularly wonky when placed next to the standard red LEGO Chair found in most City vehicles. Even a 2x4 plate would have helped a bit here to make it appear better scaled next to one another. Overall a solid 3 for today&rsquo;s offering.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Day 5:</span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;""> What&rsquo;s Christmas without goodies? Today is a tiny LEGO Gingerbread House model, it uses a clever technique by having two of the hinged brick elements with 2x4 hinge plates attached to make the angled roof, festive green and red SNOT studs are used for the icing and for the base a 2x4 plate.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Very festive looking and cute, I suppose our Snowboarder will now have a festive snack before returning to his outdoor activity. 4 out of 5 for today&rsquo;s model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Day 6: </span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Time for a slightly more involved build today, it&rsquo;s a nice cherry red and black model airplane. Micro builds at this scale are always interesting, and at least in the LEGO City Advent Calendar I find they do a much appropriate job compared to the micro ship builds in LEGO Star Wars calendars. Of course that&rsquo;s just my opinion.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I don&rsquo;t pretend to know what model of plane this is meant to evoke, I&rsquo;m not up on makes and models of Airplanes, but I do know it&rsquo;s a very nifty looking design with swept back wings, a small tail and a clear dish used to simulate the whirling propeller. Overall a very enjoyable build, strong 4 out of 5 for today&rsquo;s model. Gotta admit though these aren&rsquo;t entirely to Minifigure scale as I first thought, but they still work as toys for the Minifigure to enjoy.</span></span></span></span></p>

This model&rsquo;s fairly nice, the greatest element here is the hockey stick piece in brown. You only use about seven pieces, this sled isn&rsquo;t as involved as some of the ones I&rsquo;ve seen in LEGO Friends, however it works ok for what it&rsquo;s attempting. Average 3 out of 5 for this model.</span></span></span></span></p>

Or Mrs. Claus in casual Christmas sweater with a tray full of cookies? The front of the box would seem to indicate this, she&rsquo;s a decent enough offering for the day, and you get five of the printed cookie elements which is always a nice bonus. Very solid 3 out of 5 for today&rsquo;s offerings too.</span></span></span></span></p>

Here&rsquo;s a very intricately detailed little model with some solid building techniques, what is it? Well it&rsquo;s a Snowblower, this isn&rsquo;t often seen in LEGO, in fact this is my first exposure to the push blower design&hellip; I like it, what&rsquo;s even crazier is that it&rsquo;s got festive red and green colouring.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Here&rsquo;s our first 5 out of 5, the build is satisfying, the design works quite nicely, the only complaint I&rsquo;d have is that the image showing how to build it can be a little bit confusing, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a strong offering though and very original for a model in a calendar&hellip; at least from my perspective.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Day 10:</span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;""> Ok, this is another out of the ballpark model, at first glance I was confused by it, but once I figured out where every piece went and built it up this is a really impressive looking figure.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">What is this model? Well it&rsquo;s another toy vehicle, I&rsquo;m tempted to say it&rsquo;s either a cargo plane or a seaplane, perhaps even the Sea Duck from Tailspin, considering it&rsquo;s mostly using light orange coloured pieces. This is a really fun model, another solid 5 out of 5 for me and definitely a better offering then some of the past Friends models I&rsquo;ve had the misfortune of encountering, why can&rsquo;t the Friends designers give us solid looking toy replicas for the Mini-Dolls to play with? I mean miniature vehicle designs like this are a goldmine.</span></span></span></span></p>

In LEGO Friends calendars, when the designers weren&rsquo;t wasting time, they actually made much better outdoor food stalls for the festive parties that the characters were having.</span></span></span></span></p>

She includes a nice set of teal skis, she&rsquo;s built out of the standard LEGO City parts with typical prints. I&rsquo;d give her a 4 out of 5, it&rsquo;s a nice addition and definitely more impressive from yesterday.</span></span></span></span></p>

Not exactly Maesrk in colour choice, but it&rsquo;s a nifty looking model and really works quite nicely.

He&rsquo;s holding a power saw and dressed in what I assume is a ranger outfit, so I&rsquo;m guessing he&rsquo;s the one who cut down the tree from yesterday to use for the house. He&rsquo;s got the standard looking Minifigure parts from LEGO City, the baseball style cap on his head in is a nice light tan colour though which I think is a bit rarer. Perhaps this fellow is from the Jungle Sub-Theme, then again he doesn&rsquo;t have a machete. 3 out of 5 for today.</span></span></span></span></p>

This is a really great looking Ice Angel sculpture, it uses a lot of clear blue parts, but the best parts are the Legends of Chima fire wings parts in clear blue, which is a rare part and something folks will really want. This is definitely a 5 out of 5 day because of the unique design of the model and the fun parts.</span></span></span></span></p>

Ever since Series 8 of the CMF Santa has pretty much looked the same, the parts are always the same, same red top, same red pants, same little white beard and same Santa cap head piece. The facial print on him might have been tweaked here and there to make him look more like the Jolly Old St. Nick image, however there&rsquo;s really nothing that&rsquo;s different&hellip; In fact I think this is the exact same Minifigure that was used in the Holiday Vignette sets from 2015. Overall though he&rsquo;s still a solid Minifigure, and if you want a LEGO City diorama all decked out for the holidays you&rsquo;ll need a Santa on every corner. 3 out of 5 for the final door.</span></span></span></span></p>

All of the models that represent toy vehicles are extremely impressive, with exception to the penny racer style race car, and there&rsquo;s some really great festive looking models. The Ice Angel is a great model with some truly fascinating parts and so I would strongly recommend this year&rsquo;s LEGO City Advent Calendar.</span></span></span></span></p>

"weirdbricks","2017-11-21T13:13:03.167Z","The weakest city calendar in years!","<h3>Lego is running out of ideas...</h3>

<p>So we all know that lego is running out of ideas. But the calendars shouldn&#39;t be affected by that. For the past three years, both city and star-wars calendars have been weaker and weaker. This calendar is a pretty good example for what a calendar should NOT look like. My favorite of the city calendars might be the 2009 or 2013 one, due to the nice variety of builds and figures. Hope you enjoy my review!</p>

<h3>Minifigures:</h3>

<p>In this calendar we only get 6 minifigures, compared to many of the others where we got between 8 and 10. There are no exclusive figures here. Figures included: Kid on a snowboard, Grandma, Jungle explorer, Coast guard woman, Coast guard woman on ski and at last the Santa Claus. None of these figures are in a certain grade exclusive or special. Here i wished they could include more figures and might give us an exclusive Santa. In my subjective opinion, i do like the grandma the most, due to her torso print.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Other minibuilds:</h3>

<p>Well... This selection of minibuilds&nbsp;is just so bad, that it almost makes me cry. Look at the Christmas tree. How it developed from a tall good-looking build in 2009 to a small ugly part-thingy today. The Christmas trees is just getting worse and worse. We also got a snowman! So freakin cool... (not)! The snowman looks terrible. Not impressive at all. The rest of the minibuilds is just disappointing and terrible.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall rating:</h3>

<p>Well. It&#39;s not much positive to say about this calendar. The calendars both city, star wars, and in certain grade friends, is just getting poorer and poorer for each year. The PPP for the calendar is not great, but acceptable. It can&#39;t have taken longer time than a few hours to make this calendar. Very disappointed! In total rating i would give it 3/6. I would not pay mre than 20$ fot this!</p>

<p><em>Thanks for reading!</em></p>
