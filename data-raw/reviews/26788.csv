"CBattle12Oct","2018-12-15T00:24:58.727Z","The LEGO City theme has truly established a Cargo subtheme with this set.","<p>In the past decade or so, the LEGO City theme has produced some excellent sets that depict real-world, civilian work scenarios and workplaces.&nbsp; This LEGO City set 60169, Cargo Terminal (2017) is certainly one of them.&nbsp; It is an absolutely superb upgrade of its three predecessor sets 7992 (Container Stacker, 2007); 7733 (Truck &amp; Forklift, 2008); and 60020 (Cargo Truck, 2013) all combined into one.&nbsp; My primary reason for purchasing this set was for that realistic, spectacular 3-axle cabover truck and 3-axle turntable drawbar trailer combination, which can transport all four of the provided shipping containers and their pallet loads of cargo.&nbsp; However, it was not the only reason.&nbsp; Thanks to Target for their 20% off sale the week before Memorial Day, I received more than what I bargained for.</p>

<h2>The Box Contents and the LEGO Building Experience.</h2>

<p>The box contents are a bag of five instruction manuals and a small sticker sheet, and eight bags of parts &amp; pieces.</p>

<p>Manual 1 and bag 1 builds the forklift operator minifigure; also known as (a.k.a): &quot;minifig,&quot; a little red dolly, the pallet of blue cases depicting boxed LEGO sets, and the forklift.&nbsp; A total of 30 steps on 28 pages.&nbsp; Yes, the forklift has headlights: just ahead of the fenders between the fork mechanism and the tires.&nbsp; The orange &quot;brick separator&quot; tool is also in this bag.</p>

<p>Manual 2 and bag 2 builds the telehandler operator minifig, the telehandler, and the yellow shipping container.&nbsp; This is 49 steps on 40 pages.&nbsp; This LEGO replica of a real machine uses a simple machine: the &quot;worm screw &amp; gear&quot; in a transparent housing to raise and lower the telehandler arm by turning a small knob at the back.&nbsp; While clever use of the technic pins as axles, the front of the telehandler&nbsp;has a large gap, as if the chassis &quot;juts out&quot; without any steering or suspension details.&nbsp; Perhaps a sloped cowl or hood-like build, without adding extra bulk, would have been suitable here.</p>

<p>Manual 3 is for both bags 3 and 4.&nbsp; Bag 3 is the truck driver minifig and the chassis for the truck unit of the truck-trailer combination.&nbsp; The front turn signals are recessed into the grille; these pieces incidentally, are identical to those used for the amber/orange caution flashers on the roof-mounted lightbar.&nbsp; Bag 4 is buildup of the green truck cab.&nbsp; The manual ends with the olive container and the water scooter a.k.a. &quot;jetski&quot; on its pallet.&nbsp; Altogether, this was the longest build: 66 steps on 57 pages.&nbsp; The truck is equipped with a full-width, 6-by-2 stud, roof-mounted lightbar, as previously mentioned having the amber caution flashers as flat pieces, which I prefer instead of the round &quot;beacon&quot; pieces on the set 60020 truck.&nbsp; In addition, the lightbar has quad round, clear yellow foglights.&nbsp; Both the lightbar&nbsp;and the front-mounted grille guard, a.k.a: &quot;bullbar&quot; give this rig a &quot;road train&quot; appearance!&nbsp; What the double-clipped, horizontal bars on each side of the chassis are for, I have no idea.</p>

<p>Manual 4 is again for both bags 5 and 6.&nbsp; Bag 5 is the trailer unit of the truck-trailer combination.&nbsp; Bag 6 is the two blue shipping containers and one pallet for a lime green, mini-utility tractor, an another pallet for its two front end attachments - a dozer/snowplow blade and lawnmower.&nbsp; This was the second longest build: 53 steps on 45 pages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, manual 5 is for both bags 7 and 8.&nbsp; Bag 7 is the gatehousekeeper/tender minifig&nbsp;and the gatehouse.&nbsp; Bag 8 is the pallet storage rack.&nbsp; First, build of the gatehouse is 45 steps on pages 3 to 43, and then the pallet storage rack is 24 steps on pages 44 to 66.&nbsp; Both of these two&nbsp;stationary structures, new to the LEGO City, Cargo subtheme, provide a notion of location or setting of the set.&nbsp; Without these two structures, the set would consist solely of the vehicles depicting just a scenario instead of the cargo terminal work-&quot;place.&quot;&nbsp; Therefore, both these builds help establish where the minifigs are performing their cargo handling tasks.</p>

<h2>The Finished Cargo Terminal.</h2>

<p>Bringing all five models in close proximity to one another, everything functions - as well as looks to perform the tasks they were intended to be built for.&nbsp; Because this is a work-oriented set, three of the four minifigs&nbsp;have printed torsos - back and front, depicting the orange safety apparel.&nbsp; As far as I&#39;m concerned, LEGO should&#39;ve produced more minifigs like those; they are perfect for year 2018 being the four-decade anniversary of the minifig.&nbsp; The only other LEGO City set that has minifigs&nbsp;with this orange safety apparel I know of is the 60198, Cargo Train (2018).</p>

<h3>A feature and a benefit on each of the five models.</h3>

<p>1. Forklift.&nbsp; As on a real forklift, the front fork mechanism tilts backward.&nbsp; This lessens the possibility of dropping the pallet when the forklift is driven.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. Telehandler.&nbsp; The blue body, dark grey wheels, and black roll cage are reminiscent of the real telehandlers built by &quot;Genie,&quot; a Terex corporation.&nbsp; The word &quot;telehandler&quot; is derived from &quot;telescopic handler;&quot; the arm is extendable or telescopic for extra reach above the shipping containers.</p>

<p>3. Truck-trailer combination.&nbsp; Beneath the front of the trailer is a turntable, to which is affixed an &quot;A-frame&quot; shaped connector called a &quot;drawbar,&quot; then the axle, oftentimes called a &quot;bogey/bogie&quot; or &quot;tag&quot; axle.&nbsp; The distal end of the drawbar has a ball that fits into a &quot;U-joint&quot; hitch receiver at the back of the truck chassis.&nbsp; Overall this connection has not just one but two - points of articulation or &quot;pivot points.&quot;&nbsp; The benefit is a tighter turning radius than a &quot;fifth wheel &amp; kingpin&quot; connection of a truck tractor &amp; semi-trailer combination.&nbsp; Another benefit of this truck-trailer combination is the ability to transport container loads intended for two separate destinations.&nbsp; For instance, the trailer is detached so its load left at&nbsp;the cargo terminal, then the truck with its load driven away to deliver at another set in the LEGO town.&nbsp; The piece of cargo being the mini-tractor is able to seat a&nbsp;minifig.&nbsp; Its inclusion provides a &quot;fourth vehicle&quot; in the set and with its attachments, extra aspects of play/display ability.</p>

<p>4. Gatehouse.&nbsp; A realistic working and looking gatehouse resembling the real ones at some distribution centers, military installations, and shipyards.&nbsp; Below the window are beige parts simulating brick masonry.&nbsp; The open back has a one-piece, removable roof for ease of seating the minifig on a red chair behind the half of the slider window next to the door.</p>

<p>5. Pallet storage rack.&nbsp; Both light and dark grey&nbsp;pieces simulate the concrete foundation, and a total of eight &quot;X-truss&quot; frame parts incorporated into the build.&nbsp; This is a pallet storage rack for the rugged outdoors, which is not uncommon for this set as illustrated on its box.&nbsp; It&#39;s also reminiscent of the pallet storage rack at some marina dry-docks, and the piece of cargo being a jetski&nbsp;makes it even more so.</p>

<h2>How this set 60169 is inter-related to at least two other, similar LEGO City sets I own.</h2>

<p>The yellow shipping container and its pallet load of blue crates depicting boxed LEGO sets are perfect matches to my LEGO City set 3221, having a yellow semi-trailer also with nine blue crates depicting boxed LEGO sets.&nbsp; More importantly, each of the four shipping containers in this set 60169 are identical in size dimensions to the three in my set 7994: Lego City Harbor (2007), which has a container ship with a maximum capacity of eight containers.&nbsp; It&#39;s nice to have these size consistencies among two different LEGO City sets introduced a decade apart, so now I have a fully-loaded container ship!&nbsp; The fourth container in that set 7994, incidentally, is actually a pallet of fuel/oil barrels; that pallet is 6-by-10 studs: again identical in size to the bottom of one of those shipping containers. For me, both sets are a marvelous way to demonstrate the modern, &quot;inter-modal&quot;&nbsp;nature of cargo transportation!</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Recommendation.</h2>

<p>The LEGO City theme has truly established a Cargo subtheme&nbsp;with this set 60169.&nbsp; Recommended for all LEGO enthusiasts.&nbsp; In my opinion, the set is a &quot;must have&quot; for LEGO City fans of commercial trucks &amp; trucking, hoisting and loading machines, or even logistics and materials handling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
