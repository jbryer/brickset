"Bison_Bricks","2017-06-09T17:20:19.083Z","Decent value, design could be better","<p>The 2017 City Coast Guard subtheme has earned its own <a href=""https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Coast-Guard-Starter-Set-60163"">Starter Set (60163)</a> at an affordable price point. Featuring a shark attack play scenario along with a lifeguard tower to spot the danger and an ATV to assist in the rescue, the set features an overall good value, although I am unimpressed with the design of the builds.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>There are three minifigures in this set: a <strong>surfer</strong> (featuring two expressions: scared and smiling), a<strong>&nbsp;lifeguard</strong> (wearing a shirt and pants--she is not planning to get wet) and an <strong>ATV driver</strong> (wearing a wetsuit and an optional life jacket). Four minifigures&nbsp;are typically included in Starter Sets, but the&nbsp;fourth minifigure&nbsp;in this set is replaced with a standard dark gray <strong>shark</strong>.&nbsp;The small&nbsp;<strong>accessories</strong> help enhance the play nicely: a walkie talkie, a pair of binoculars, a life preserver and two surf boards.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the two builds in this set have some design issues. The <strong>lifeguard tower</strong> features a clever ladder build&nbsp;and uses the Coast Guard color scheme. However, the lifeguard must stand, has no protection from the sun, and the life preserver is high off the ground, unavailable to the minifigures if the tower is unoccupied. Imagination--or modification--is required.</p>

<p>The <strong>ATV</strong> also has issues.&nbsp;I like the color scheme and the bed large enough to accommodate a passenger,&nbsp;as well as the snappy red surfboard on top. However, the roll cage pitches forward at an awkward angle, and the nose of the ATV looks like a mess (although&nbsp;the curved slope with the printed logo looks very nice). Having a steering wheel instead of handlebars makes this look a little more like a golf cart than an ATV.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>Starter sets like these are an affordable way to build up your minifigure&nbsp;collection and can often enhance play scenarios if you own other themes. This one offers some nice parts and good playbility, and at such a low price point it is hard to go wrong. However, I wish the execution of the builds was done a little differently.</p>

The value may come off as a bit weaker thanks to the fact that other Starter Sets have featured four Minifigures, but considering you get a shark in this set I feel it works fine.</span></span></span></span></p>
