"Bison_Bricks","2017-06-04T14:51:41.64Z","Nice set, minor quibbles (value is one of them)","<p>Only two sets in the 2017 City Coast Guard line have wheeled vehicles (which makes sense), and <a href=""https://shop.lego.com/en-US/4-x-4-Response-Unit-60165"">4x4 Response Unit&nbsp;(60165)</a>&nbsp;is the more substantial one. Although this set looks good and offers decent play value, I have a few quibbles with the design and overall value.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The build is straightforward and doesn&#39;t take long. This set is rated for ages 5-12, although I feel like a starting age of six would be more appropriate. There are several stickers, including large ones and some for curved surfaces, which require careful application.</p>

<p>The biggest surprise for me was the trailer, which I was expecting to be a quick, bland build. It merits its own instruction booklet, and both looks good and functions perfectly. The rescue boat nests perfectly on the trailer without locking in with studs, and there is no movement of the nested boat side to side or front to back. The trailer also includes two small stands in the front for keeping the trailer level&nbsp;when it is unhitched. The stands&nbsp;require attention though: leaving them down interferes with the operation of the tires slightly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I almost never deviate from the official instructions, but I see three areas of improvement for the build of this set, easily remedied if you wish to modify.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Grille:</strong> The grille on the 4x4 is massive, and it looks just as good, if not better, flipping the silver tiles in a horizontal orientation rather than a vertical method as instructed. (It is also a shame that the silver grates show the round open studs beneath in a contrasting white color, it&#39;s not a clean look. This flaw is hidden from view on the box, which shows the grille at an angle. There is no easy way to fix this.)</li>
	<li><strong>Seating:</strong> The instructions place the diver, steering wheel and headrest in the center of the vehicle (which is at odds with the photo on the front of the box). Instead I placed the steering wheel and driver off to the side. There is room to do this, although the driver just has to angle his arm upwards a little to clear the windshield. This set up looks more realistic. Unfortunately, there is no way to seat the boat captain minifigure&nbsp;in the 4x4 as well without major modification.</li>
	<li><strong>Steering Wheel:</strong> The steering wheel on the rescue boat sits on the floor, and the minifigure is meant to stand behind it. This looks unnaturally low, so I suggest adding one or two 1x2 tiles beneath it.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>The 4x4 rides high on thick beefy tires and just looks rugged and well-equipped for the beach. The trailer is more complex that I thought it would be and works perfectly (you can also haul the green dinghy on it, but not both boats at once). The orange rescue&nbsp;boat looks quite utilitarian, perhaps a little clunky. Small details throughout the set abound.&nbsp;The buoy has a rounded inverted plate beneath it so it rests cockeyed on a flat surface, which is a nice, realistic touch, and I appreciate the silver piece that allows a minifigure to hold onto. The octopus is a nice addition (most other Coast Guard set include a shark). &nbsp;</p>

<p>A few more minor quibbles:&nbsp;The crate of supplies can be carried by either large vehicle, but&nbsp;the fit is awkward in the 4x4--the fire extinguisher must lay&nbsp;down and it is difficult to install or remove it in&nbsp;the trunk without removing the roof. Lastly, although I like the look of the large antennas on the 4x4 and rescue boat, they are the most easy to fall off during play and require you to adjust your hand position during play&nbsp;to accommodate them.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>This set is priced too high in the United States. I realize that large molded pieces like boats can drive up the price, but the end results look a little skimpy at a regular retail price of USD $40. Buyers in other countries may get a better value.&nbsp;Despite the high price, I do like this set. The results looks good. I especially like the color scheme,&nbsp;and the set offers at least a couple of play scenarios. A forthcoming&nbsp;Coast Guard set called <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60168-1/Sailboat-Rescue"">Sailboat Rescue (60158)</a> features the same rescue boat piece (with, in my option, a&nbsp;sleeker and much better-looking build) that should be compatible with this trailer too.</p>

<p>Overall this is a well-rounded set with a few design issues and an expensive price. Unless you are an eager fan of the theme, it would be better to wait for a sale.</p>
