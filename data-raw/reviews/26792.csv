<p>This set is of another big helicopter, much like the police helicopter in <strong>set 60046 Helicopter Surveillance</strong>, released in 2013/2014. However, on this occasion, the name is actually apt for the job: this is a Search And Rescue helicopter&nbsp;that can actually carry a jetski, operated by the female rescue worker. It seems to be loosely modelled on Jayhawk or Sea King helicopters. The set as a whole has slightly fewer pieces than the one in set 60046.</p>

<p>The build itself was fun, a little over 1 hour was all it took. There are a few stickers to apply, but all of them are easy. The helicopter is quite swooshable. The winch mechanism works OK, though lowering it requires weight to be attached to it. The resulting helicopters IMHO look good, and with the few additions makes for a nice though basic play set. Although the price is&nbsp;fairly high, it is in line with previous helicopters of this size. Overall, I think this is a good set.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The jetski&nbsp;and the light house are easy builds. The helicopter is a good build, though few if any special techniques are used. There is a little of the bright &#39;off-colour&nbsp;pieces&#39; disease, but by and large they are covered up nicely. The interior of the cargo-hold is somewhat of a colour&nbsp;mess, and the knob operating the winch is also bright red. It was interesting to see how the nose of the helicopter was constructed. The most interesting part was seeing how they winch-mechanism and the engine on top were constructed.&nbsp;The mini light-house is a simple but effective build.</p>

<p>This set has a recommended age range of 6-12 years old, and IMHO most 6 year olds should be able to build it without too many problems.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are four minifigures included: two female rescuers, a male pilot and a male canoe operator. The prints are very well done, and the respective combinations of torso, legs, heads and hair pieces make them unique to this set. All face prints are single face prints. My favourite face print is that of the civilian, with the drops of sweat - whether from fear for the shark, or the workout operating the canoe.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>As said above, the &#39;landscape&#39; build of the wreckage and lighthouse is simple but fairly effective. I am not a fan of the jetski. Frankly I think it is too wide (I like the 4 stud wide builds far more). The jetski&nbsp;does count as an &#39;independent&#39; vehicle for the coast guard, as it carries its own number (like the ATV en speed boat in <strong>set 60165</strong>, for instance).</p>

<p>The helicopter looks good, although - arguably - the nose could improved upon, as there is a gap in between the two quarter round pieces that make up its shape. I like how the winch mechanism is incorporated inside, though I do not like the bright&nbsp;colours used in the interior. I am not a fan of the bright red operating brick either. The rest of the helicopter looks good: the colourscheme, the engine design, the tail, and even the ramp at the back. The operating mechanism is simple, and the choice to put the plate studs out works well: it looks better and allows for the jetski&nbsp;to slide out easily. The way the winch can be moved out with the side door open is simple but effective. So is the door stopping mechanism.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This is mostly a play set: a jetski to &#39;sail&#39; around, a very swooshable helicopter, that is not too heavy but might be somewhat big to hold, and numerous scenarios that can be played out. The interior of the helicopter is also quite accessible - as much as possible as with the rotor blade set-up.</p>

<p>The helicopter itself is big, attractive and impressive enough that it can actually serve as a display piece, though it might be advisable to switch out the winch operating knob.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall I think this a good set in an overall quite strong Coast Guard line-up. The build is fun, the helicopter is impressive, and there is enough room for play. This set is quite expensive in PPP, but it is in line with the Helicopter Surveillance police set from a few years before: fewer pieces, but also a lower price. In general, I think this is a set that should appeal to Coast Guard fans, as well as helicopter fans.&nbsp;</p>

"Nemesis101","2019-04-06T10:55:47.703Z","Perfect!","<p>A bought this set a few months ago at a local store for 30,- euro. Didn&#39;t except to get it a so cheap. The main part of this set is obviously the helicopter and I will primarily focus on that one in this review.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>There are four minifigs to this set, one pilot with a grey orange vest, two rescuers in an orange suit and one kayak passenger who needs to be rescued. Quite a lot minifigs for the price of this set, nice looking outfit for the pilot and the kayak passenger does have some sweat on his head which is quite good because he&#39;s in danger.</p>

<p><strong>Build experience</strong></p>

<p>Since it was a while ago (15 years at least)&nbsp;this way of building had a few new things for me. The interesting things for me were the engines on top, the rotor and the winch. The rest of the set is quite basic, but of course still fun to do.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>The helicopter looks amazingly realistic. When I compare this to the 60013 and the older one it&#39;s bigger and the rotor spins way better because of the new design. The looks of the rotor and engine is perfect. Inside there&#39;s room for a jetski which can be taken out by lowering the rear hatch. At one of the sides there&#39;s a winch which can be used by sliding the door open. Too bad you see the big red mechanism to use it at the other side. Hopefully next time they will use the mechanic winching from 60013 again. That&#39;s much better. When airborne the&nbsp;doors (both sides) tend to go open.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>My oldest wanted to play all day with it. At the age of three he&nbsp;&quot;destroys&quot; the rotors of weak build helicopters. This one he didn&#39;t destroy&nbsp;once. He flies around and rescuing cars and his little sister.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To me this is the best helicopter Lego ever build. It&#39;s realistic, strong and has a lot of play features. It only lacks a mechanic winch.</p>
