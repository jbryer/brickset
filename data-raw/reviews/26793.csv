<p>Coast Guard Headquarters is the high end set of the 2017 Coast Guard range - and indeed, IMHO it is a great play set. A&nbsp;Coast Guard cutter, a speed-boat, a decent sized helicopter, and a small HQ building. There are 7 minifigures, and all this allows for quite a few scenarios to be played out. I liked the build of the helicopter and the cutter, and it was good for about 1,5 hours of building fun. Overall, I think this is a good set, but I am a but conflicted about the price, which is quite high. I can understand the big pieces (two hulls, the helicopter platform pieces) are quite expensive but still... I would have liked&nbsp;to see more people being able to afford to the CG cutter.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>As so often the case, builds like this are spread out over numerous booklets. One starts with the bouy&nbsp;and the speedboat. The one thing I missed&nbsp;from the bouy&nbsp;was a Technic axle to strengthen the column of 2x2 round bricks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The speedboat is a simple build. The two massive stickers are not difficult to apply, but one has to take care to line them up properly. They are also partially transparent. I liked the way the two pairs of seats&nbsp; are constructed, to make the seats come half a stud inside. The &#39;leaks&#39; are simple but effective.</p>

<p>Next up is construction of the helicopter. By and large, I actually like the design of the helicopter. There are two handles in the middle that rescue-divers can hold on to on the way to rescue someone. The tail-boom is a but oversized. Again, construction was simple, but quite enjoyable.</p>

<p>The Coast Guard Cutter is the biggest build in this set. The front section of the hold is covered by a &#39;sideways&#39; build, which works out extremely well. Well done by the designer to have it line up properly with the orange band on the rest of the superstructure.Construction was not difficult. I also like the design for the radar and the simple mechanism to launch the speed boat.</p>

<p>The Head Quarters is arguably the most disappointing build in this set. The helicopter platform and the quay are OK. The building itself is rather basic, and the interior rather spartan. The radar construction is effective.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>The are 7 minifigures in this set: one male speed boatowner, and 6 Coast Guard personnel, 3 male and 3 female. There are a male rescuer (using the cutter) and a female rescuer, presumably using the helicopter. The captain and helicopter are male as well.</p>

<p>The speedboat owner has a double face print, one for before, and one for after wrecking his boat. I like the stud-launched flare gun he carries on him. This minifigure is the only one with the double face print.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All minifigures wear different head gear. The combination of torsos, legs and heads and hair-pieces results in all minifigures being unique to this set, though the individual parts are by and large are not.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The speedboat actually floats, and IMHO looks very good. It is sleek, and the designer has done an OK job of filling up the square hole with interior. Frankly I like it better than the ones that have been designed for other City sets.</p>

<p>The helicopter is IMHO one of the better designs for small helicopters Lego has released in the last couple of years. The floaters are in in proportion, and fits snugly on its landing pad. It is quite swooshable, and fairly easy to hold. It misses a winch to lower and raise the rescue lady.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Star of the set is the Coast Guard cutter. It is equipped with a medical room (like set 7739 (Coast Guard Patrol) from 2008), and a speed boat, launched at the stern. There is a fairly large bridge. The hull is identical in shape to that in sets 7739 (which&nbsp;was orange) and set 60014 (Coast Guard Patrol) from 2013 which is also white. It is interesting to see how the design of the superstructure makes this boat look so much faster than the previous patrol boats. Compares to the 2013 version, the small helicopter platform at the stern and ROV crane in the back have been replaced by a search light and speedboat launcher.</p>

<p>The quay and HQ are simple build, but effective. In design, the HQ is in line with older police stations. There is some small interior on each floor. What seems like a recreation room at the bottom (showing a rescue mission on TV) and control room (with coffee machine) on the top floor.</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>This set is clearly designed as a play set. Two boats, a helicopter, the shark and octopus, as well as the HQ and the 7 minifigures all make that completely clear. The helicopter is veryswooshable, and the two boats actually float, and are easy to play with. It is also easy to access the interior of the CG cutter. The speedboat drop works well. All offering plenty of scenarios to play out. The speed boat, the HQ and the helicopter platform are IMHO too simplistic to serve as a proper display - though they can be used as a good basis for a MOC. The CG cutter, on the other hand is impressive enough to be a display set. Frankly, I think this is one of the better large play sets Lego has created in the past couple of years.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, I think that this is a good set. Lots of play features, various&nbsp;ships and features to play with, and the two ships and the helicopter are all well designed. The one draw-back would be its RRP, especially in the US. I hope many people will be able to find this set at a discount.</p>

"ElsW","2018-11-08T17:38:41.35Z","Braving the Waves!","<p>my 6 year old twins just received this for their birthday, having nagged / begged / longed for the big coastguard set for over a year.</p>

<p>Build: manageable for a lego-mad 6 year old, pretty good fun for mum, Grandma struggled a bit!</p>

<p>Play: fantastic - we love the lego city shorts and this set has bought &quot;Braving the Waves&quot; to life.&nbsp; We have already got most of the smaller coastguard theme sets, but the HQ / platform and ship have taken the play up a level and the boys are really engaged with this set, telling some great stories and creating wierd and wonderful scenarios that generate a rescue.</p>

<p>Value: having paid approx. 40% discount vs RRP then this is great value.&nbsp; it will be a central part of the playroom for a good while yet, and combined with our cheap and cheerful blue painted MDF sea then lego&nbsp;city remains at threat from tidal waves, sea monsters and other disasters for the foreseeable future</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Best bits: amazing facial expression on the speed boat passenger, chains around the edge of the main boat, sea-floats on the helicopter</p>
