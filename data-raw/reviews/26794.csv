"BlueGalaxy47","2017-05-29T20:45:36.433Z","Nice Build","<p>I like this set mainly because of the statue element. I think it It adds a sense of mystery in the jungle! I like the spider also included and the way the leaf moves is clever. Overall, I really like the statue build.</p>

<p>The minifigure looks epic because of the colour scheme and texture.The accessories are also really appropriate and useful.</p>

<p>On the other hand, I think that the buggy does not look that good mainly because I do not like the shaping at the back of the buggy.</p>

"caleb_giddens","2017-10-01T15:08:33.84Z","Nice, but look at the PRICE!","<p>This set is the smallest in the new LEGO Jungle Explorers (CITY) line.</p>

<p>It is what you would expect from the smallest set but does not meet the expectations of the other smallest sets such as the Deep Sea Explorers smallest set (which included an octopus, much&nbsp;to my liking).&nbsp;</p>

<p>PIECES - This set includes decent pieces, including the new spider piece, similar&nbsp;to the ants from the INDIANA JONES AND THE CRYSTAL SKULL Line. The buggy includes some pretty standard pieces and a printed logo bonnet (thankfully not a sticker). The shrine has some fauna and a decent blue jem piece.</p>

<p>Minifigure (one) - The one and only minifigure doesn&#39;t have much to say for itself , except for its machete (or two in&nbsp;case of extra pieces).</p>

<p>Play features- there is one play-feature which includes a tree falling with a spider on it.</p>

<p>OVERALL- Its a decent set and a really fun starter&nbsp;but for the price of &pound;5.00 RRP it is not the best.</p>
