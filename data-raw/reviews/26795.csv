Highlights include three critters (crocodile, snake, and frog), nice jungley tree with fun hiding place for gold, and THREE whole minifigures, which is more than are included in quite a few larger and more expensive LEGO sets out there!</p>

<h3>The Critters</h3>

<p>What attracts me to the Jungle themed sets most of all is the varied selection of creatures. This starter set does not feature the wonderful new cats included in some of the larger City Jungle sets, but it is still nice that one large and two small critters are included. The crocodile appeared first in the Swamp Police sets from 2015. It is made of 4 pieces: body, top jaw, tail, and technic pin to anchor the tail. The eyes are strikingly printed and the body is intricately molded. The top jaw can be opened and shut, and the tail swishes from side to side. There are six studs on its back, so a brave explorer can go for a wild ride. Most of the Jungle sets include a croc, so if you buy several you will be able to populate a whole river with them. The other two creatures included are quite rare: the little yellow frog is in just four sets to date, the first of which was 2011&#39;s Pet Shop, and the light yellowish green snake is new this year and in only one other Jungle set. The snake is nicely molded but not printed, and appears to be a type of rattlesnake.</p>

<h3>The Tree</h3>

<p>The tree is small but quite atmospheric. Four foliage pieces are included giving it a lush effect. There is a small hiding place at the base of the tree with a hinged door, where three gold pieces can be cached, which is a fun little detail. The snake can hang from the tree with a clip, and the frog can perch atop one of the leaves. Overall quite a bit of decorative and playable value packed into a very small number of bricks here!</p>

<h3>The Boat</h3>

<p>This set also includes a small swamp-mobile. Not a particularly exciting build here in my opinion, but the color scheme does look nice with the flame yellowish orange on dark gray base. There is seating for only one minifigure, plus a removable brown box in back for carrying small cargo. The two black propellers at the back spin. Overall I think the boat is pretty meh, but interesting to note that it does utilize two of a unique and brand new piece: 6177704 inverted bow in dark gray. Potentially very nice for making curved shapes, as the prow of this little boat. The tile at the front of the boat is printed and features the City Jungle emblem of a leopard peeking out behind leaves. No stickers at all in this set.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Three minifigures are included: a male and female explorer, and a bespectacled male scientist. None of them are particularly spectacular IMHO, but all feature very detailed front and back printing on the new for 2017 torsos. I do like the head of the male explorer (also new this year) - he has a contusion on his right cheek and a bold smirk. The (again new head) scientist is my favorite of the three - he appears to be very sweet-natured and nerdy, and the pockets of his rumpled clothing are stuffed with various gadgets. He seems like he would be fun to hang out with :-). Three minifigs really is a pretty big haul for a $10 USD set - especially one that includes a croc as well!</p>

<h3>Accessories</h3>

<p>The explorers wield two excellent silver machetes, and the scientist has a lovely large magnifying glass as big as his head. A camera is also included, as well as the aforementioned gold pieces (1x1 round tiles). A simple brick-built creature grabber can be used to pick up the snake from a distance.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I think this set is very worth picking up if you have any interest in the theme. It could potentially be squeezed into any type of freshwater waterway in your LEGO town, not necessarily a jungle area. While I like the Jungle theme in theory, I&#39;m not &quot;wild&quot; (ugh) about the vehicle-heavy implementation of the larger sets. This little set is light on vehicles and heavy on foliage, people, and critters. Pretty sweet for ten bucks!</p>

"mafon2","2017-11-05T09:19:34.553Z","The beginning of the adventure","<p>A little boat, a little cache and a&nbsp;huge crowd of extras.&nbsp;Not counting three diverse&nbsp;minifigs, there is also a colorful band of critters: an alligator with the blue peg holding it&#39;s tail, a toad of a strange yellow color&nbsp;and a lime snake. Quite a gathering.</p>

<p>The builds themselves are noting special, but combined with &quot;actors&quot;&nbsp;provide vast opportunity for the role play.</p>

<p>Make a note that there&#39;s a spare machete! So you can arm all of the tough guys. And it&#39;s just a great tool to have. The &quot;white coat&quot; has two expressions: normal and scared. I find it hilarious. And as for now, he&#39;s my favorite.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of&nbsp;excessive boat-cars sets, and sadly jungle theme of Lego is mainly vehicles combined with the small piece of scenery. But it has many interesting pieces (mainly critters), and, as I said, it&#39;s a huge sink for children&#39;s imagination. I wish they made it a little less &quot;locomotive&quot; and more stationary, though.</p>

<p>Apropos of this set, the only complain is a headpiece of the guy in a cap. It set so tight that I can&#39;t budge it! Good thing I stuck it straight.</p>

I am more of a Star Wars fan than a City fan but this set is incredible value for money. For $9 AUD&nbsp;you get 3 detailed minifigures, a crocodile/Alligator, a small boat and a tree with play features. Price Per Piece is around that beloved 10 cents per piece mark even with 3 minifgures&nbsp;and a crocodile/Alligator that cost a lot more. Overall the builds are average, minifigures are good but is great value for money.</p>
