"Sobel","2017-06-06T18:52:53.887Z","Small helicopter but great potential!","<p>As mentioned before, I like collecting LEGO helicopters, so this small guy was a spontaneous buy when I ordered my <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21309-1/NASA-Apollo-Saturn-V"">NASA Apollo Saturn V-Rocket</a> at the LEGO shop! I expected something a little larger in size for the price of 20&euro;, but OK, here are the details.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>As always, a sturdy, nicely designed box. My big girl liked it so much, she snatched it from me and cut out the pictures she liked most... ;-) ;-(<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Just standard LEGO parts you need for a helicopter and a small vehicle. Only exception maybe the leafs from the small temple, the spider and the machete, which was new to me.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with two minifigures: a female pilot for the helicoter and a bearded male explorer for the quad. A small spider is also included. Personally, I would have liked one more minifigure for the price. Perhaps some larger animal like jaguar or panther or something...<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing big to say here. Straightforward, done in some 15-20 minutes max. Despite it&#39;s small size, the helicopter gets quite a good reinforced structure, for the more rough players around!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I&#39;d like to compare this model to the other transport or freight-lifting helicopter I own, the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60034-1/Arctic-Helicrane"">60034 Arctic Helicrane</a>. And for 60158 being a lot smaller than the mentioned, it is quite good! Of course, it can&#39;t be that detailed, but it also features a winch and even an openable cockpit. There are no more features to the helicopter, only the small temple has some sort of swinging branch to uncover the secret treasure! Neat!<br />
What I dislike a bit are the rotor blades, because they have that joint in them. Would it be too much for LEGO, to create some medium sized blades between the ones used here and the large ones from the set mentioned above?<br />
The helicopter has a length of ca. 22cm (8.7inches), for comparing purposes.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Like I said before, a nice set for a good price. What makes it that good is the potential in playability! If you combine it with perhaps one or two other sets of the theme, you&#39;ll get a very cool world to play in. And even this set alone can be good fun!<br />
Again, one more minifigure or an animal would be a great improvement</p>

"ElsW","2018-10-07T10:51:22.327Z","A lot going on at a pretty good price","<p>As a stand-alone kit then a helicopter, buggy and a temple provides enough play to tell a story even if this is the only jungle theme stuff you&rsquo;ve got. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The helicopter is lighter weight than others we&rsquo;ve got but the winch is a good (albeit fiddly) addition that adds great play value. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The jungle buggy and temple are both simple builds, but the spider and jewel provide the extras you need to complete the story.</p>

<p>A good fit with the volcano explorer / lava&nbsp;theme sets.</p>

<p>Love the ATV and minor scenery piece included in the build, and the extended wheel height on the midsection allows the heli to roll nicely. Minifigs are basic, but will fit nicely with several other generic builds.</p>
