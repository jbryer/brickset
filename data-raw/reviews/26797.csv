"Michel_Ange","2017-08-13T21:56:20.027Z","An ambitious set hindered by its trade-offs","<p>On paper, this set has it all : two vehicles, a shrine and a panther. Sadly, everything feels like decisions had to be made to cram as much things as possible into a 30&euro; box.<br />
<br />
The half-track is one of the highlights : a good build, sturdy and rather straightforward but with a very nice &quot;adventuring&quot; feeling and a rather ingenious idea to have the tracks adhere even on slippery ground. The fact that the aft wheels don&#39;t touch the ground is a slight drawback, as is the all-stickered decoration (most of the decoration being stickers make sense, but the hood could have been much better with a printed part)<br />
<br />
The small utility vehicle does the job, but has a weird look : too big to be a quad, too conventional to be a buggy, too small to be a jeep... what on Earth is that supposed to be ?!<br />
<br />
The shrine has good tan parts and a simple but interesting play feature, but overall only looks good from the front.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m a big fan of the fig&#39;s colour scheme and intricate designs, both front and back, and the girl has a lovely hairdo ; for a set this size, only two figs seem a strict minimum though.<br />
<br />
I liked the old spider design, I really love the new ! It has a more organic feel, and blends better with the surface on which it is placed. The panther too is excellent, and its posability allows for a wide range of expressions : curious, ferocious, playful...<br />
<br />
If you take it overall, it is a good playset (maybe lacking one last fig for the price). If you take it for the models, you may wish the designers sacrificed the second vehicle to make a more complete shrine.</p>

I was not very interested in the whole Jungle series, it can&#39;t compete with the Volcano series from the previous year, in my opinion. I got the two helicopters from this series and I was OK with it. But since the recent LEGO catalogue had so little to offer for me, I&nbsp; turned my interest back to this series and got me this set and the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60160-1/Jungle-Mobile-Lab"">60160 Jungle Mobile Lab</a>.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are&nbsp; 378 pars in this set, which is more than with the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60123-1/Volcano-Supply-Helicopter"">Volcano Supply Helicopter</a>. I guess this one is a good comparison. Unfortunately, most of those parts are provided by the chain links of the halftrack. The rest is just basic car-parts and some stones and plants for the &quot;temple&quot;.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with only two minifigures (three, if you count the panther), which is a little cheap. A set with an original retail price of almost 30&euro; should at least contain three minifigures. A lot of smaller sets feature more figures than this one here.<br />
The minifigures have a lot of gear (camera, campfire, pan, radio...), as in most of the Explorers-/Adventure-themed sets.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A very easy and straightforward build. You start off with the small buggy, followed by the &quot;temple&quot; and the halftrack. The chain links are a little annoying to put together, but OK, I knew that.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>While I also like the colour scheme, as with the Arctic- and Volcano-sets, there is unfortunately really not so much about the looks of this set. Furthermore, too many stickers for a set this size!<br />
The main part (halftrack) looks OK, it is sturdy and robust. The crawlers move nicely, in my opinion better, than in other sets. On the other hand, it has no functions except &quot;driving&quot; around and hooking something with the chain at the back. Also, why didn&#39;t the designers give it real doors? Those &quot;sticker-doors&quot; look extremely awkward.<br />
The &quot;temple&quot; is OK, has a nice ancient/run-down look to it. I also like this colour scheme and the trap function, which makes this piece more versatile than the main vehicle...<br />
The small buggy is a nice addition, even though it looks a little odd. It has no use, except carrying the toolbox. Personally, I would have liked two motorcycles with an additional minifigure better than this thing. The toolbox can also be loaded on the halftrack.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While having quite some potential in playability and okaaaaayyy...... looks, this set does not really present us which much exciting features. The only real function there is, is pulling the lever in the &quot;temple&quot; and springing the trap. Nothing more. I expect more out of a set that still ranges between 20 and 25&euro;, though being from early 2018.<br />
So, again, might me an OK toy for a child with good imagination, but nothing of greater worth for a collector.<br />
And I&#39;m sure as hell gonna lose that small campfire-thing one day...</p>
