"LEGO_Ink","2017-06-02T04:13:42.94Z","The Bill for Neat Elements","<p>Honestly, I have been waiting for the new Jungle theme ever since I first saw the various toyfair images. Obviously, there&#39;s adventure. There&#39;s an abundance of new color, in Flame Yellowish Orange. Across the theme we&#39;ll see new flora and fauna: Jaguar/Panther, jungle spider, and an apparent Audrey II. And, kayaks!</p>

<p>With so much to offer, the main question would be: &#39;Where&#39;s the line for your wallet?&#39;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s...explore...a little more.</p>

<p>Set #: 60160</p>

<p>Name: Jungle Mobile Lab</p>

<p>Elements: 426</p>

<p>Wallet Request: $59.99 / 49.99&euro;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For starters, the front of the box depicts a great adventure in the making. While an entire set is typically made to be used together, I feel the argument could be made that there is the potential for four different interactions. It also helps to have four minifigures. Through the trees, you can see LEGO CITY in the distance. I&#39;m not one to get stuck on logistics, but I will go ahead and point out that an unexplored portion of jungle that close to a city seems humorous, but possible I suppose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The back of the box exudes functionality, showing the kayak in storage, movable plant(s) and creeping crocodile, as well as teamwork. There&#39;s also a little advertisement for the new My City 2 app.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once opened, the box lends 5 numbered bags(not pictured), 3 instruction booklets (1 scenery, 2 vehicle), 1 kayak, waterfall plastic (I received two, not sure if this will be the norm), 1 sticker sheet, and 1 Blue 8x16 Plate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From Bag 1, there are a few notable goodies, minifigures to be discussed later. A new machete, which will go well with many other MOCs. The carnivorous plant halves are really beautiful, featuring a dual injection pattern of Red and Lime Green. The new spider body is really appreciated while featuring a subtle abdomen pattern, eye cluster (6?), and spindly legs. The compass is a new printed element, accurately featuring various scales, direction-of-travel arrow, orienting arrow, and so forth. It would be a great alternate, though not necessary, for our <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71013-6/Hiker"">Hiker</a> friend.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The carnivorous plant is first, aside from minifigures. The base is pleasing, with a ball-joint for lots of movement. The mouth can be opened by either 1)Squeezing the little tabs at the rear, or 2)Prying at the &#39;Guard Hairs&#39;. It&#39;s not difficult, but large handed folks will put in a bit more effort. The rubber band fits snugly and, whether it&#39;s intentional to the design, or not, snaps the plant closed with a fairly light touch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bag 2 builds the waterfall and sneaky crocodile portion. Honestly, the waterfall was much more enjoyable to build than I anticipated. While only using one <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=47847&amp;ccName=4513326#T=C&amp;C=85"">Rock Panel</a>, the rest of the vignette is composed of a variety of elements that build up to the ruins, waterfall, and foliage. It&#39;s a stable build, with elements that could be substituted if you&#39;re looking for extra plant life elsewhere. The Slid-o-dile/Croc-slide feature seems a bit excessive, and certainly out of place from the rear, but perhaps saves from excessive opening on the Waterfall Sheet. My kids have had much more fun just poking our reptilian counter part through the falls at different angles. Considering the use of no fewer than 8 different colors, there is a natural blend that occurs over most of the build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bag 3 will finish out the minifigures, and start us on the Mobile Lab.</p>

<p>There are four minifigures included: 2 female and 2 male. Each one has a uniquely different torso, but all feature Dark Blue, unprinted, legs. The layering and detail on each is fantastic, especially the explorers, with various climbing tools, radios, and even a phone tucked into the females waist. The male mechanic has a slightly different take on the previously featured tank/suspenders from <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=973pb0784c01&amp;idColor=1#T=C&amp;C=1"">Pharaohs&#39; Quest</a>, with an offset dog tag necklace and expected oil stains. The female Scientist has some neat features, and I find it a nice detail that she has her lab coat over her exploration hoodie/shirt. She actually gets to work in the field, as well as being the technical workforce.</p>

<p>[img]https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4201/34864207961_d704da38ce_b.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>The backs feature additional details, formatted differently for the male and female explorers, a wrench for our mechanic, and adjustable straps for our multifaceted scientist. Notable fact, she is also the only one with a dual printed face. I neglected to capture a shot with their various head adornments, but they can be viewed later on.</p>

<p>[img]https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4249/34996254585_3ce0837cba_b.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The kayak is a really neat element, and I&#39;m excited it gets introduced in various colors. It features a 2x3 stud seating area for the occupant, a 2x2 spot for various gear, a mid-front mounted stud (which doubles as a camera holder), and a single stud on each end for docking and/or towing. Or more gear. It should also be noted that this kayak doesn&#39;t actually float. Every image I&#39;ve seen has a glare that makes it appear to be a smoothly rounded object. The sides are actually inset a little, presumably to save on the amount of material used in production.</p>

<p>[img]https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4223/34864207691_900cab48a2_c.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we start building the primary vehicle, hints of the Flame Yellowish Orange start to creep in. Also included are two paddle ends. I was hoping for an extra, but looks like I will have to order some. They attach, via a hole in the end, to a standard bar/lightsaber. They are slightly tapered at the ends, and the instructions even called for them to have an offset/tilt to function like a real paddle. It was a bit more than I personally use while kayaking, so I did adjust it a bit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Half of Bag 4 will be dedicated to the new color scheme.</p>

<p>[img]https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4225/34608382530_e7a8ba05ed_c.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two new elements to be found are the Wedge 4x6 Double curved/sloped? It would seem to fit the wedge category, but it&#39;s not technically curved. The angles are matched perfectly to the cab tops we&#39;ve seen on previous vehicles. The other is a new-to-me element, the &#39;Brick, Modified 1 x 2 with Handle on End&#39;(BL), which has only been seen in five previous 2017 sets, and is again new, in this color.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After Bag 5, we conclude the set with a really reliable looking exploration vehicle. The truck, for all intents and purposes, is a standard 6 Studs wide and 22 Studs long, with a little extra from the front and rear brush guards. There&#39;s a spacious interior, with room inside for everyone: Two physical seats in the cab and space for two to sit/stand in the rear.&nbsp; The kayak can mount on top via a stud connection. Storage compartments on the right side. And plenty of scientific goodies, such as a testing area and topographical map (which coincidentally marks the location of the plane wreckage), to keep exploring for a while.</p>

<p>I will point out that the inverted slopes above the front tires leave a bit of a gap where they meet the 1x2 plate above the mudguard, but it is a miniscule gap and, in my opinion, adds a bit of esthetic. The exterior stickers aren&#39;t overbearing, and add just enough detail. Back to elements, however, the use of crowbars as extended brush guards, or the implied gap between cab and lab unit, are some of the features that drew me to this set. With the modular capabilities that governments are putting into vehicles, it wouldn&#39;t take much to retrofit various equipment onto the back of this particular vehicle, making it better suited for the next environment. Design features like these are useful, and they&#39;re subtle. There&#39;s a designer in Billund with a keen eye. Okay, okay, more than one.</p>

<p>All my extra ballast: These are all extra parts, not ones I took out to save.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>So, here we are. I do find myself hoping this line would continue. Perhaps with not so much of a focus on the equipment (which has been stated by others), but with a dive into what the ruins actually are. I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s necessary to create a story, like with Pharaoh&#39;s Quest, but just some sets that add to the idea of exploration and finding a previous civilization. As much as I do love a good vehicle, there&#39;s only so much peace and quiet you can expect around a 6-wheeled Mobile Lab.</p>

<p>I do accept the fact that this set falls right in the middle of ones containing the new giant cats. I didn&#39;t have the budget for the biggest set, and the Halftrack Mission wasn&#39;t quite as appealing for me. I really do appreciate all it contains, and this brings me full circle to the wallet. At $59.99 / 49.99&euro;, the price ratio comes to $.14/.12&euro; per element. While I would have gladly paid $50, possibly $55, something about $63 after tax was just a bit big to chew. And then I had to consider: The new colors, in bountiful numbers. The functionality. The new elements, across a wide spectrum.</p>

<p>This set has a lot going for it, and I would certainly recommend it. Especially if you can get a lower price.</p>

"madkins007","2017-09-11T19:01:15.42Z","Nice kit, bit of a letdown though","<p>1. Some Background: This is another kit I got with some birthday bucks. It has been on my wish list for a while (as an update to the old 1990&#39;s Johnny Thunder sets), but the price has held me back. The main thing I wanted was the mobile lab to act as the &#39;base unit&#39; for my exploration team.</p>

<p>2. First Impressions: Ordered from Lego Shop- quick shipping, nice add-ons, well-packed. The actual box is&nbsp; typical of recent City kits- lots of photos supposedly showing what the kit can do. Lots of bags without as many parts per bag as we often see, which made it easier to build without sorting the parts out too far.</p>

<p>3. Waterfall: Not wildly impressed with this. It had some nice bits, like the pieces that represented broken steps, and the set piece looks nice overall. The croc slide is interesting but rather over-engineered in that you can skip the slide part and just push the croc&nbsp;through the waterfall. The reason you might want to do this is that the slide mechanism sticks out a LOT in the back, and this shortcut means you can knock most of it off.</p>

<p>4. Minifigs and other Accessories: The &#39;Audrey&#39; plant is almost the same as the one in the larger 60161 Jungle Exploration Set, but actually has a nicer base. The kayak and croc are the same too. And, quite honestly, so are the minifigs, for the most part.&nbsp;</p>

<p>5. Mobile Lab: This is the main thing I got the set for, and it was certainly a nice build- but I had hoped for a little more. When all was said and done, it was a pretty basic truck build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actual lab part had some interesting elements to it, and considering the mostly smooth base it attached to, I had hoped it was going to be removable (even though no previous review mentioned this.) There are 4 long black tiles that tie the lab to the truck bed, and there does not seem to be much reason for them other than that, and two tiles that seem to represent AC or something that tie the lab to the cab of the truck.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first mod I made was to remove the 1x6 black tiles, and then to reposition the &#39;grill&#39; tiles to the rear of the lab, just above the 1x2 grill pieces. I also replaced the &#39;flame yellow&#39; wall piece in the front of the lab with some trans blue pieces to make another window. This way I can easily remove the lab and remount it in various ways, such as an lookout/observation post on tall legs, or a Hq unit on a few brick risers and so on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;m still working on a couple other mods- a nice tall communications antenna, some trail cameras, and remote control spotlights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>6. Last Thoughts: As much fun as my grandaughter and I have playing with this set, I am frustrated over the duplication from the larger 60161 set. I really wish Lego would make individual elements available apart from the bigger kits so you and I could create the world we want without the &#39;duff&#39;. And, if they did, I would buy the 60159 Jungle Halftrack in a heartbeat to round off the set.</p>
