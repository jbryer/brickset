Not only do I love the cool vehicles in the new sets, I appreciate the &#39;hidden dangers&#39; elements they share, and the shift from the &#39;tomb raider&#39; sort of explorer to what seems to be a more scientific expedition.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
2. I would not have bought this set on my own. The $120 initial price is just too rich for my blood- but I had a very nice birthday, so splurged a little. We can argue whether the kit is a &#39;good value for the money&#39;, but that argument is rather moot when you just cannot afford it under normal conditions.<br />
<br />
3. First Impressions: Ordered from Lego (for the points and freebies. They shipped fast and packed it well. It&#39;s a darn big box, 9 bags, a sticker sheet, and 4 manuals. The manuals are up to Lego&#39;s usual standards and I did not notice any errors or real issues.&nbsp;</p>

<p>4. The Vehicles: The ATV takes a lot of heat for being &#39;yet another ATV kit&#39;, but it is a solid build and I was pleasantly surprised at it&#39;s heftiness. As it neared completion, I kept making driving noises as I imagined it fording streams, pathfinding for the bigger vehicles, or shuttling supplies between the main basecamp and where the teams are working.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The helicopter is an interesting &#39;in-between&#39; size and build- not as small as some of the more &#39;whirligig&#39; kits or as large as the &#39;real choppers&#39;, but it is a size you can imagine a research team using in the field. I don&#39;t know if it was intentional but I found myself thinking that the &#39;folding blades&#39; would be handy to let them move it through the forest... for whatever reason they might do so.<br />
<br />
The truck is the focus of the kit, and the main thing I got it for. The thing that really surprised me is that I expected the truck to be the climatic build of the set, but it really wasn&#39;t that much more interesting than the ATV. I liked a lot about the truck- colors, the microscope, the claw arm, etc. but I was a little disappointed&nbsp;that there isn&#39;t more space in the back- you cannot fit two people back there- the &#39;large screen tablet&#39;&nbsp;is in the way&nbsp;(I think it would have been better as a wall-mounted version. I also sort of felt that the truck needs a spotlight and an antenna- but I can add that later.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
5. Set Pieces. Nice build with some interesting aspects- the &#39;feathered frog(?) temple horns or feathers, the trap door and boulder tosser, the jointed plane, the cool tree, and the jaguar launcher are nice and covered well in other reviews.&nbsp;While I appreciate the linked together bits, I personally prefer play sets that fold or otherwise store more neatly.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
6. Minifigs and Animals. I actually think there are a couple too many figurines in the kit. There are 6 places for people, if you put two in the truck. Lego does not name the figs anymore so it isn&#39;t like they have much of a personality out of the box and it does not help that several of them are basically dressed alike.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The croc is sweet with the darker green and painted eyes, the red spiders are nicely detailed and dang cool, and the yellow and gold frogs are adorable but the real star of this group is the posable jaguar. The ability to pose it in a standing position is just so dang neat!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
7. Other: The plant is fun and has been covered a lot. The kayak is a great play piece but otherwise unremarkable. The camping stuff is nice- but why both a stove and a fire? I really like the machetes and compass.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
8. Closing thoughts: This really nice set represents one of my big pet peeves about Lego. I would LOVE the ability to buy some of the aspects of this kit by themselves. I&#39;d pay about $15 for the chopper, about $25 for the ATV, and $40ish for the truck- but I have to wait for someone to sell them on eBay or something. It would be great to be able to buy them from Lego, maybe a couple months after introduction.<br />
<br />
Lego&#39;s whole &#39;you can&#39;t really buy what you want Bwah ha ha!&#39; attitude bugs me. Blind kits are fine, but why not sell the pieces after a year or so? Why not capitalize on the popularity of minifigs and make them available online individually?&nbsp;<br />

And where, darn it, is my Fururama ship and crew set????</p>

"ElsW","2018-11-08T17:50:03.227Z","Jungle Rumbe","<p>A really fun set with more than a passing reference to Indiana Jones.</p>

<p>We got this for my 6-year old twins&#39; birthday&nbsp;and they were over the moon.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>They have been wanting this ever since they first saw it, and were jumping up and down with excitement when they unwrapped it.</p>

<p>The build is pretty straightforward, although the winch on the helicopter is fiddly and generally not that functional (a common problem on all the other helicopters with the same style string winch cable)</p>

<p>the angled join between the temple and the plane crash site is robust and creates a good backdrop for the adventures</p>

<p>the main truck is roomy and robust</p>

<p>the best bits for the boys are the hidden traps across the temple / plane crash site that has taken the playability to the next level - they have delighted in the hidden trap door, falling boulder and hidden jaguar and have made up amazing stories about treasure hunting and killer spiders.&nbsp; they have already made extra temple sections to hide more treasure in, and are really enjoying the set.&nbsp; we will end up combining this with some of the existing smaller jungle and volcano vehicles to make sure there is enough rock breaking and exploring action.</p>

<p>we bought this at about 40% discount vs. RRP so for us great value.&nbsp; the bigger sets do seem to have the ability to link together lots of the smaller sets / vehicles into a mammoth story telling adventure&nbsp;</p>

<p>we also love watching the Lego City shorts and re-enacting the stories using our own lego&nbsp;so this set is a sure fire winner</p>

<p>During the building the fun was getting greater and greater and my youngest son started to play with it already. After about 1 hour of build time, we all 3 enjoyed the massive playability of this set. Well done LEGO.</p>
