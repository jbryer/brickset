*Spinosaurus
*Cool plane
*Driver looks cool

CONS:
That's not what the driver looked like in the movie.
Annoying cameraman (but he's okay as apassenger.)
Plane=to small

This is a very great set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"EL_Mo","2008-01-25T20:50:49.687Z","Totally Sweet","I got this on sale at a Wal-Mart I believe. Very nice. The plane is very, very high quality with the engines and all. I also very much admire the tree. I'm not quite sure why, but it intrigues me. Anyway, cool set with nice minifigs and a useful camera. Don't remember the price, but even if you have to pay a little much, get it. 10 out of 10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"water_jedi_17","2008-06-15T22:32:05.34Z","spinosaurus attack"," I was able to rebuild this set after it became part of my heap of lego pieces.
 The plane:It is pretty small and the cockpit only fits one person,unlike the movie.The top opens up so a mini figure can clmb out.There are three wheels at the bottom and a piece with a hole at the end.More on that later.The propellers seem a little too small. Plane rating 3
 The tree is a pretty random build making it more realistic.It's 'spine' is a black spire piece.The only part which seemed unrealistic since it's a black 4X6 piece with a hook piece.Rating 4  
  Spinosaurus:Has a long tail about the length of the spinos body.It also has a tounge which is a neat feature.Unfortunately there's not much mobility Rating 5
  The camera man machine can go up and down to get a better view.There's also a tv screen at the bottom so someone can see it. 
  Remember the pieceon the plane I was talking about?Well it goes inside the hook on top of the tree.It's a nice feature and very realistic like in the film.Theminifigures aren't from the movie and it would be better with Dr grant and his comrads.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Ladondorf","2015-10-11T15:46:00.15Z","Not a Spinosaurus","<p>I must say that this is a very good set, the plane and tree are well built. I especially lke how there&#39;s a hook to connect the two. The Spinosaurus&nbsp;figure is extremely well detailed and has a lot of articulation such as arms, hips, a tail that has four movable segments, a neck, a mouth and even a tongue!&nbsp;It&#39;s not a Spinosaurus, though.<br />
<br />
I should start off by saying the Spinosaurus wasn&#39;t made for this set, the same year, LEGO had a Dinosaurs theme which included 4 main sets with a basic body and extra limbs, heads, etc. to turn it into different Dinos. The T. Rex set came with a sail that could be&nbsp;attached to the back, which made a &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, even though it just looked like a T. Rex with a sail. When LEGO&nbsp;made this set, they just reused the Spinosaurus model, therefor, it&#39;s arms are too small and the head just looks like that of a T. Rex. I would have loved to see what it would have&nbsp;looked like if they made new molds for the&nbsp;arms and the head&nbsp;for this set, despite the fact that it wouldn&#39;t have been cost effective. Luckily, If the user doesn&#39;t want the Spinosaurus, they can just take off the sail and play with it as a T. Rex.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other than that, the figures aren&#39;t exactly from the movie, it just comes with a generic Stuntman&nbsp;and a Cameraman, it would have been cool to see a little LEGO Alan Grant.</p>

<p>Other than that, the set is designed very well, especially for the time in which it was released. I&#39;d recommend it to fans of the movie or dinosaurs in general, despite its inaccuracies, the figure is very well made. I can imagine a child having lots of fun with this set.</p>
