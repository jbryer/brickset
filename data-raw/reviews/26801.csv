<p>The sails are quite fiddly to get set up - my 5 year olds definitely need&nbsp;adult help here as you need to thread boom through the sail.</p>

<p>As for the coastguard theme&nbsp;mini figures&nbsp;the boys&nbsp;really like the double sided heads - one side for happy sailing / surfing,&nbsp;the other crazy&nbsp;fear / rescue me now face!&nbsp;</p>

<p>This combined with the other lower cost coastguard sets have been brilliant fun to play with - lots of crashes into rocks, shark and octopus attacks, and of course amazing rescues -&nbsp;and I&rsquo;m afraid some human sacrifices! &nbsp;General view is that surfing in shark infested waters is a bad idea - so I guess we are never emigrating to Australia....</p>

<p>The addition of a blue painted mdf board to the playroom has&nbsp;allowed creation of our very own Lego sea, with cheap&nbsp;wilko blox yellow base boards&nbsp;forming a beach. &nbsp;I guess a blue towel or blanket would do the same job. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The boys have also expanded the &nbsp;dangerous rocks in the set and built some extra sea monsters. &nbsp;The rocky islands are easy to copy and expand which for my age group kids is a winner.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coastguard theme certainly stimulating lots of imaginative play. &nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a nice little Coast Guard set that has just about everything you could wish for: two boats, a shark, rocks and two minifigures. There are many scenarios that can played out. The build is easy and surprisingly fun. This set is comparatively expensive (looking at PPP), which is not surprising as there are a number of big specialist pieces in this set. That said, overall this IMHO is a good set, if you can stil find it.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>This set is a quick and easy build for an adult, and - as pointed out by someone else - except for the sail of the sail boat should be a fairly easy build for children age 5 and up. There are a number of stickers. Most of them are easy to apply, though the stickers on the CG Boat are somewhat tricky due to the curved surfaces. The hulls are OK, and the one for the sail boat is a floating hull. There are a few big pieces (the hulls, the window on the CG boat, the sail). Building this set is an example of how some quite substantial vessels can be created with relatively few pieces.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are only two minifigures included, one sailor and one CG Boat pilot. They are OK but nothing special. They both carry life vests, and the sailor is not without his trusty coffee mug. The prints are well done, and the facial expressions are appropriate.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The vessels overall do look good, IMHO. The sailing boat is rather minimalist, but works well.It does feel as a finished build. It has its unique vibe. The one thing I do miss is something to simulate a leak or a fire - something to make a rescue necessary.</p>

<p>The CG speed boat has its own style, that fits the theme nicely. It also makes it sufficiently different from the other speed boat that has the same hull, which is included in <strong>set 60165 4x4 Reponse Unit</strong>.I would have likes a second operator, or a dedicated diver as additional crew. Just as the sailing boat, the speed boat is rather minimalist, but does feel finished.</p>

<p>The rocks are rather basic, and only have minimal space to put a minifigure on at best. They can easily be expanded though.</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>This set is clearly a display set. Many scenarios can be played out, all elements are there: rocks to crash into, a shark, and two boats.&nbsp;Yet the boats lack substance to serve as a display piece on their own. The rocks can be enlarged, while the boats are not so big as to require a massive jetty; a small jetty for play can be constructed easily. Both boats can easily be incorporated within a larger display though. Especially the sailing boat can easily handle more minifigures.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, this is IMHO a good set. The price is fairly steep for the part count, but most of it can be explained by the big expensive pieces, like the hulls. I would have liked to see one more minifigure&nbsp;incorporated in this set, though. IMHO it offers quite good value for money. If you can still find this set, I would seriously consider getting it as a gift and play set.</p>
