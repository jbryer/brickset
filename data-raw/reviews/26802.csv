<p>For city themes (Coast Guard, Mountain Police, Volcano Explorers) Lego generally has a top of the line play set; for the Lego City Jungle Explorers, they have gone one step beyond. <strong>Set 60161 Jungle Exploration Site</strong> could be considered the high end equivalent to <strong>Coast Guard HQ (set 60167)</strong> or&nbsp;<strong>Prison Island (set 60130)</strong>.</p>

<p>This set has taken things one step further, its equivalent being <strong>set 60125: Volcano heavy-lift helicopter</strong> (2015): a massive play set created around a big - truly big - helicopter. There are also a ATV, a shallow water vehicle transporter (resembling a landing craft), a camp tower, the flesh eating plant, and - of course - ruins to be explored that hide treasure. All the builds are good fun; the base tower is the simplest of all, while the helicopter is the most complex.</p>

<p>This set offers a lot for play, and in general is impressive. The big issue - however - is its price: it is expensive (usually sets this size are); that said, I think the UK and European prices are acceptable. IMHO I am very glad I got this set, and it is definitely worth saving for, though it still will be out of reach for many. In many ways it is a shame that Lego does not release helicopters like these as a single item set, which would probably put such a magnificent craft within reach for many more.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The box is loaded with 11 bags, with the various elements of this set logically divided over them. There are quite a few stickers, the majority of them easy to apply. Most 8 year olds should be able to complete this set without too much trouble. Building this set took me some 3 hours at a leisurely pace.</p>

<p>One starts out with the construction of two pallets of research equipment and the flesh-eating plant. These are extremely simple; I like the light green leaves that come with the plant, and they seem to be rare.&nbsp; Next up is the ATV. It looks like an outsized jeep; again, the construction is nothing special, as it shares many similarities with the other vehicles in this range. In the same manual, the cargo-carrying platform (which is loaded onto the helicopter) is constructed.&nbsp;&nbsp;The third vehicle constructed is the landing craft. Its build&nbsp;- again - is simple but effective. I would have preferred the stern to be more integrated with the side-walls, as it can break&nbsp;off quite easily now. The sides are constructed with basic SNOT techniques.</p>

<p>The first building to be constructed is the&nbsp;look-out tower with the crane. In combination with the base and the construction of the lift - mechanism, the whole set-up is well balanced (or can easily be balanced). The ruins are perhaps not the biggest to be found in Jungle sets, but are again well done. Mostly brick-stacking, but the trap mechanisms are very well integrated. So has the Big Ugly Rock Piece. The construction of the statue covering the entrance to the treasure cave&nbsp;itself was fun as well. I do not like the tendency to create angles by using Technic pins and connectors. It is rather flimsy, and leaves room for flexing.</p>

<p>Finally, the massive helicopter is constructed - which takes up four of the eleven bags in this set. Construction in general is fun; off-coloured bricks are by and large well covered up. The catch and release mechanism to fix the load to the helicopter is cleverly designed, and well hidden. The stickers on the tail&nbsp;were the ones that gave me problems: they are so large that them being placed at an angle or off would be extremely visible. Internally, there are quite a few similarities to the construction of the large helicopter in the Volcano heavy-lift helicopter set. Due to its Technic core, the helicopter is remarkably sturdy.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are seven minifigures included in this set: 3 women and 4 men. Of these minifigures, four are unique. The female helicopter pilot is the most common figure, found in the three other Jungle sets that include a helicopter. The female scientist and the engineer can also be found in set 60160: Jungle Mobile Lab. The three unique male explorers share the torso, but have different faces and hats/hair pieces. The female explorer also has a very detailed and high quality torso print (different from the males). I like her hair piece. Only the female scientist has an alternate face print, one extremely scared (or angry) while the other is a somewhat apprehensive smirk. None of the figures has a leg print.</p>

<h2>The builds</h2>

<p>Starting out with the scenery pieces, they are relatively simple, but IMHO well done.&nbsp;The control tower/crane is a simple and basic structure, as common in remote research bases. I like the bright colour of the lifting equipment, which can be positioned in such a way as to balance out the added weight of the three pallets with cargo present in this set. The flesh-eating plant is well served by the light green coloured leafs.</p>

<p>The ruin is generally&nbsp;well done. As said above, I do not like the use of Technic angled pieces to create an angled set-up. Especially since there are regular Lego-brick alternatives that would have made for a more solid connection. I like the way the foliage is used to hide the stairs, as well as the integration of the trap-element. Fortunately, there is only a single red knob that is visible. The tree is well designed, using to break up the Big Ugly Rock Piece. The fallen statue is nice, and covers a cave that can hide treasure or a dangerous animal.</p>

<p>The three pallets are simple, but effective, carrying essential&nbsp;equipment for research: lights and generators,&nbsp;food and fuel, lab equipment and above all a coffee maker. The carrying platform (that is attached to the helicopter) also has space for a couple of motorcycles, helmets and tools to clear jungle and repair the motorcycles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ATV is basically a jeep, and IMHO arguably the least attractive of all the vehicles in the Jungle Explorers line. It can carry a crate, but little more. Overall, I think it still is well designed.</p>

<p>The landing craft is again, simple but well designed. The colour scheme and design works well, and seems to be a fairly faithful representation of real life (military) examples. It is big enough to carry a small vehicle (like a quad) or a couple of crates. I can imagine people enlarging&nbsp;the design in order to be able to transport larger vehicles. As the roof and front window come off, it is easy to put the operator in the cabin.</p>

<p>Finally, the star of the set: the massive helicopter. The design seems to be a mixture of Skycrane helicopter and Osprey VTOL aircraft design (though the rotor blades in this set are fixed). The cabin part looks very good, and it is easy to put in the pilots. As there is room for a co-pilot, it is a shame that none is included in this set. The tail is massive (due to its Technic core), and the clamping mechanism used to carry the payload is very well designed, well hidden and seems sturdy. The landing gear is fairly solid, though arguably could have been sturdier (with some modification). Overall, the designer has done a very good job on the design.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This set is - above all - a play set. The very swooshable&nbsp;but heavy helicopter, the landing craft, the ATV all can be sailed, driven and flown around. There is a ruin to explore, and a base element with a working crane. The 7 minifigures&nbsp;are sufficient to operate them.&nbsp;The tiger only adds to the fun.&nbsp;The one issue that I see, is that the helicopter might be too big and too heavy for smaller kids to handle comfortably.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The helicopter itself could well be a massive display piece. It is big enough, and the Technic core as well as off-coloured&nbsp;pieces are well hidden by the designer. It can be displayed carrying supplies, or the included ATV. It can also be fun to design other payloads for the helicopter.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this is a very good set - it is in some ways the top-end <strong>set 60161 Jungle Exploration Site</strong> on steroids. One additional vehicle (the landing craft), the massive helicopter, and otherwise fairly similar in make up. In piece count&nbsp;this set&nbsp;is 50% bigger, in price the difference is about 30%. The design is good, the off-colour&nbsp;pieces are well hidden, and so is the Technic core of the helicopter. It also works well with smaller Jungle sets, as the buggy or quad could be transported by the landing craft. Is it worth the price? I would argue it is, at least in Europe - although IMHO the price&nbsp;it is at the higher end of what I deem reasonable. It is also a set worth saving for; if one has saved for the Jungle Exploration site, IMHO one should seriously consider whether to save a little longer for this set.</p>
