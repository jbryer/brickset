For kids, I think, it&#39;s a nice addition to their other lego friends sets, but on its own it lacks a little play value because it doesn&#39;t include a minifigure, but if you own one or two minifigures&nbsp;you&#39;re all set. the overall look is nice and simple and absolutely playable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
