The only guide is the picture, which is what you are really paying the &pound;99.99 for.&nbsp; The picture comes out separately and an assistant opens the box to put the photo in it for you.</p>

<p>The real downsize is you cant have pictures taken with say your partner or your child, also i think an numbered axis along all sized would be very helpful. You only get 3 attempts at what picture you want, which no one advises you of, also a mirror so you can check what you look like before you enter is a good idea.</p>

<p>Overall I was disappointed but the finished item is for a present for my sister in Australia, and I am sure she will like it, but it would have been a whole lot better if my husband and I could have had one done together.</p>
