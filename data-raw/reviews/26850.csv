"Odeinoichus","2017-09-10T21:26:42.653Z","Unfortunately a bit of a Dud.","<p><strong>Set #71017 Arkham Asylum Joker:</strong> Compared to the rest of this series AAJ is an unfortunate offering with not much to say, he&#39;s a Minifigure that was included in an actual set, an expensive set, but still a set did offer him as one of the minifigures.</p>

<p>His legs, torso, hair piece and accessory (Handcuffs) are all the same as the version found in the set, a plain orange jumpsuit with Arkham printed on the back. His facial expressions may be different, at the time of this review I have not yet acquired the larger set which features this same character. He has a huge frowny face on one side and a goofy looking expression on the other, I believe it is meant to show he&#39;s really trying to change and tricking Batman with his &#39;I&#39;m Harmless and Innocent&#39; face.</p>

<p>Very weak offering as far as the character goes, however this is the cheapest method of acquiring the Arkham Jumpsuit for making different characters, provided you have spare hands to change out Joker&#39;s white skinned hands. So I&#39;d recommend it more for the parts than anything else, however it&#39;s pretty safe to skip if you have already purchased the larger set with this character included.</p>

THE BOX AND INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
I&#39;m not going to go through this again. He comes in a package that you&#39;ll probably just throw away after you open it and there&#39;s a checklist to mark how many minifigs you have from that series. Can we move on now?</p>

<p><br />
THE MINIFIGURE</p>

<p><br />
Here we go. Let&#39;s dive in! This version of TLBM Joker is undoubtably one of the least interesting TLBM CMFs, but he is still worth getting. Here&#39;s why: #1: you can get prison suit Joker without buying the immensely expensive Arkham Asylum. #2: He does have an exclusive face. Quite a few people weren&#39;t happy that Lego included Joker in the CMFs instead of another, more exclusive character, especially since an almost identical minifigure is included in a set. The reason I think Lego did this was to give kids who don&#39;t have a hundred fifty bucks to spend on Arkham a chance to get prison Joker. If this truly was their reason, then I very much appreciate that. Let&#39;s take a closer look at the minifigure.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ngnppuyoz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Joker is wearing a bright orange prison outfit with the word &#39;Arkham&#39; stamped on the back.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/jx1s023oz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>There&#39;s no printing on the arms, but there is still plenty of detail. Lots of rumples and wrinkles on the whole suit, even down the legs. A section of the collar hangs down, revealing a white shirt underneath. It&#39;s slightly orange-ish, but that helps distinguish the shirt from Joker&#39;s white skin, so I think it works out fine.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/6g4th5yib/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Joker&#39;s large, ridiculous hair is the same but as I mentioned before, his face is not. One side shows a somewhat resigned or sheepish smile and the other side...</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/p8gokrxhf/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>would you just look at that? That is the saddest sad face Lego has ever made and it is perfect!! TLBM line wouldn&#39;t be complete without it! Joker&#39;s accessory is a pair of handcuffs that are made of a rubbery plastic.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/j7iznnsur/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The design of these are a bit different than the in-set cuffs. The crimping near the cuff itself is absent. That, paired with the more rubbery plastic makes for a sturdier pair of handcuffs.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/4obum97fn/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Joker also includes the standard black CMF stand.</p>

Despite other&#39;s misgivings about this minifigure, I think Lego made the right choice including him in the CMF line. If you don&#39;t have the budget to buy Arkham, then I highly suggest you purchase this guy. If you do have the budget to buy Arkham, then I still suggest you pick him up anyway, just for his amazing face.<br />

"Lobo_da_boss_","2021-11-09T19:29:15.767Z","A fairly mediocre Minifigure, with the head being the only noteworthy attribute!","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>Joker, despite being a major character in &#39;The LEGO Batman Movie&#39;, rarely deviates from the purple tuxedo design, and&nbsp;he obviously had to make an appearance in the CMF series for the film but&nbsp;the variant chosen only has one exclusive piece which doubles as the only interesting piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigure-&nbsp;</p>

<p>He has &#39;The LEGO Batman Movie&#39; Joker hair in its typical green, a fantastic Joker head with a slight smile on one side and a comically large upset face one the other, depicting his reaction to being rejected by Batman in the opening sequence&nbsp;and, he reuses the Arkham Asylum jumpsuit torso and legs from 70912 Arkham Asylum which work, but also infuriate me, as I strongly disagree with CMF pieces being used in other sets, or the other way around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Accessory-</p>

<p>The accessory is a very dull single set of handcuffs in light grey. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;In conclusion-</p>

<p>This is a really dull Minifigure, with the face&nbsp;being the only piece assigned as exclusive, not even the accessory is particularly enticing, so I would only recommend this figure to those who wish to have a complete collection&nbsp;or people who want an easy way to amass an armada of Arkham jumpsuits.&nbsp;</p>
