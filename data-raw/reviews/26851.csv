I picked him up at WalMart yesterday and got a quite nice minifigure, in fact a favorite of mine.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The same bag every other set in the Minifigures line has come in since&nbsp;Series 1. A yellow and black bag that is almost impossible to open, decorated with a couple of the minifigs in the series.</p>

<p>Also included is the average checklist, which has instructions on the general build of the minifigs and their accessories (how to mount capes and armor, etc.). On the backside of the&nbsp;checklist there is a large image of Batman punching the Joker, and a mystery minifigure that comes out in a couple months.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the dual molding on Catman&#39;s legs are shown in reverse in the checklist, appearing with brown on top with yellow boots, as opposed to the actual minifigure.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Catman is mostly a recolored Batman with the addition of Wolverine claws. None of the parts are really new, aside from the utility belt which has appeared in&nbsp;a large amount of <em>The LEGO Batman Movie </em>sets so far this year. This is a nicely detailed&nbsp;piece, and it appears in reddish-brown.</p>

<p>The torso is mostly orange-yellow, with reddish brown hands, black claw marks and grey straps. Catman appears to be quite&nbsp;muscled, typical for Superheroes minifigures.&nbsp;As mentioned above, his&nbsp;legs are dual molded in yellow and brown.</p>

<p>Catman&#39;s head is a slightly darker shade of flesh (I don&#39;t know the color name), and features a white headband and some stubble. He has a disgruntled expression.</p>

<p>A brown cape and cowl are included, the older type for the former and the updated cowl for the latter. Both are nice, especially the reddish-brown cowl. Also included are a pair of silver Wolverine claws and a typical base stand.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>Really the same thing in every Minifigures set, a simple assembly of a minifigure and their accessories. The only thing I had any real &quot;difficulty&quot; with was forgetting that he included a utility belt at first.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>A quite cool little minifig, Catman certainly stands out among the small army of similarly-appearing Batmen included in this series. The orange-yellow is a nice color which I think goes quite well with the reddish-brown. Catman is definitely one&nbsp;of the coolest-looking <em>The LEGO Batman Movie </em>figures.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>So yeah, Catman, a cool minifigure for a cheap price. When looking for him, feel for the new-style cowl WITHOUT the chinstrap and the 3-pronged claw. I quite like him, and if you&#39;re a cat or DC fan, try to find him.</p>

"8BrickMario","2017-02-11T19:41:58.533Z","I guess he'd be a copyCAT!","<p>Batman, Catwoman, Catman. We also have Batwoman. Geez, these guys are hard to keep track of. But how is this minifigure?</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>His pieces are decent and could be reused, especially the claw blades.</p>

<h2>The minifigure</h2>

<p>Thomas Blake, a former big-cat catcher, decided to copy Selina Kyle&#39;s act. His minifigure is a pretty good representation of his design. His cowl is the short-eared Batman mask, which is appropriate, and it&#39;s in reddish brown. His face underneath has tanned skin and the same sweatband technique Batman minifigures use for the white eyes. He has some stubble and a slight frown. He wears the standard cape in brown, and his uniform has been captured quite well. It&#39;s mostly yellow with his trademark scratch symbol on the front and some silver straps. He has the standard muscle detail and the new utility belt in brown. His legs have brown hips and are yellow with dual-molded brown boots. Catman&#39;s accessories are the claw piece introduced with Wolverine.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>I&#39;m not a huge fan of this figure. He&#39;s a faithful translation, but not very inspiring in my eyes. Get him if you want him.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-09-13T18:00:37.093Z","Holy Forgotten Felonious Felines Batman!","<p><strong>Set #71017 Catman:</strong> Due to the colouring choices some people might think that this is Batman cosplaying as Wolverine, but that is not the case at all, DC loved creating villains and if we had a Catwoman, why not a Catman?</p>

<p>Catman is dressed in yellow, a nice dark yellowish orange to be precise, with matching brown, which at one point was Wolverine&#39;s colours, as I noted before. In fact Catman is even using the Wolverine claws for cat claws. He get&#39;s a utility belt piece in matching brown and an older style cape in brown. His dual-molded legs look nice too, there&#39;s very limited printing on this minifigure.</p>

<p>With a scowling facial brint with unshaved look and the new bat-cowl piece in brown Catman is an overall great looking character, perfect for the villains of the LEGO Batman Movie and great for some fantasy ideas where Batman might have joined the X-Men. Overall I&#39;d strongly recommend this figure.</p>
