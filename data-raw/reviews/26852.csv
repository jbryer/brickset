&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Harley&#39;s pieces are nice, but all very specific to her.</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>Saying it right now...this is a G-rated <i>Batman: Arkham Asylum</i>&nbsp;Harley. And that&#39;s great! Seeing her in a nurse outfit is a nice reference to one of her iconic designs while keeping it kid-friendly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the hair. It&#39;s a great new dual-molded piece with messy bangs and large spiraling pigtails tied by opposing-colored bands, which are a bit uneven to add some realism. The style is both classic and completely new for her, and it looks great.</p>

<p>Adorning her hair is a tiny nurse&#39;s hat that plugs into her hair Friends-style. It&#39;s decorated with a heart and molded so it sits off-center on her head.</p>

<p>Continuing the mixture of classic and new, Harley&#39;s face is very similar to past incarnations, but for the LBM addition of a red diamond beauty mark. I prefer this excited expression to the exaggerated ones she has in the Lowrider.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her outfit is nicely printed, with a nurse&#39;s scrubs featuring a stethoscope, large pockets, and diamond buttons. A splash of pink is found with her hands and lower arms, made to look like rubber gloves. I wish the pink wasn&#39;t limited to this, as it stands out too much. Her legs are dual-molded and printed to represent heavy-duty spike-toed and laced boots.</p>

<p>Lastly, Harley comes with a clipboard tile, featuring a profile of the Joker and and an &quot;H+J&quot; heart scribbled all over it- just like the doodles she made when first meeting the Joker in&nbsp;<em>Mad Love</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall thoughts</h3>

<p>Get her! She&#39;s a great addition to the huge cast of Harleys (She now has <i>9&nbsp;</i>minifigures, more than any other Batman villain!) and manages to call back to various points of Harley&#39;s past while adding something fresh and new.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-09-13T17:19:01.917Z","Holy Dangerous Medical Staff Batman","<p><strong>Set #71017 Nurse Harley Quinn:</strong> Harley in the LEGO Batman movie features a lot of quirky little outfits, this is meant to be a disguise, but it&#39;s not much of one. Still... It works.</p>

<p>Nurse Harley features dual-molded legs, which look great with the boots printed on the lower portion and the little added print detailing for her upper legs. Her torso is dual-sided featuring a very nice looking nurse uniform with a red belt and a stethoscope included. Her arms are printed as well with some pink detailing for the wrists, her unique hair looks wild and crazy, it also includes a peg hole for the little nurses cap. Round everything off with a nice printed clipboard showing off the Joker&#39;s file and some extra details added by Harley... well it&#39;s a great figure.</p>

<p>I definitely recommend this figure, I&#39;d say she&#39;s one that would look great and multiples are a must for all the fun parts. Any other hair that has a peg hole in it can use the little nurse&#39;s cap, which includes a fun heart print on it. So you can&#39;t go wrong with Nurse Harley.</p>

<p>Nurse Harley Quinn is a good figure with nice arm and leg printing and has some cool hands .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The hair attachment is a nurse hat with a heart print , the hair is dual moulded in red and black , the head is a happy expression , the torso is a nurse&#39;s cost and the arms are printed and the hands are pink and the legs are dual moulded and feature side printing .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>The accessory is a sand blue 2&times;2 printed clipboard with the jokers file . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a good figure but doesn&#39;t feature any necessarily useful parts but I still recommend it to any DC fans .</p>
