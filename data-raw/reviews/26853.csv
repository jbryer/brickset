<p>Clan of the Cave Batman has dual-molded arms and legs, again used to great affect, coupled with the very detailed caveman costume printing on his legs, torso and arms this costume will look great next to other prehistoric inspired minifigures. Wielding a large club and wearing a rare brown cowl Batman leaps through prehistoric jungle trees while fighting the forces of evil. (Or going to that fancy dress Masquerade party put on by the elite of Gotham.)</p>

<p>Fun and definitely recommended for another great offering from the LEGO Batman CMF series.</p>
