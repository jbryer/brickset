<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ridiculousness of this minifigure is what makes it so great. Batman looks simply hilarious in a pink tutu!</p>

<p>Cowl and Head:</p>

<p>To start, this variant of Batman has pink cowl, which is a new color for the piece and it looks great! Underneath the mask, Bruce Wayne looks extremely confused. He himself doesn&#39;t seem to understand why he is wearing a fairy costume!</p>

<p>Torso and Legs:</p>

<p>The printing on the torso and legs is the usual intricate details you can expect from LEGO&#39;s minifigure series. No back printing, but his back is mostly obscured by the wings anyway. However, the dual molded arms with printing on them (as well as on the sides of the legs) more than make up for this.</p>

<p>Wings, Tutu, and Wand</p>

<p>The wonderfully molded&nbsp;pink&nbsp;tutu is hands down the best part of this figure. It really sells the &#39;fairy&#39; aspect, somehow even more so than the wings. The wand is also pretty great, and I hope Batman will put it to good use in The LEGO Batman Movie.</p>

<p>This is definitely my favorite figure in the series. The comedy is a big draw to get this figure and it does not disappoint! If you are trying to feel for this figure, try to feel for the pink tutu, which has a frilled texture unlike any other piece in the series. Good luck finding one!</p>

<p>Fairy Batman includes dual-molded arms and legs with a healthy dose of pink in his costume, there is still some black, however his customary cape has been replaced with pink fairy wings, his utility belt has been exchanged for a pink tutu and he&#39;s carrying a magical pink wand instead of his customary batarangs. This is one costume that will never blend into the shadows.</p>

<p>The facial expression, the overall look of the figure, everything about this makes me wonder if DC ever did use this costume in a Batman comic, they had some funny ideas about fighting crime some time ago, and Adam West era Batman may very well have used such a costume in his crime fighting career. That being said, unless you&#39;re trying to complete your collection of every Bat-Suit, Fairy Batman is probably one some kids might prefer to skip. The parts though make this one of the more unusual yet quirky costumes to track down for MOC fans. (How else would you get a pink cowl for your MOCing needs?)</p>
