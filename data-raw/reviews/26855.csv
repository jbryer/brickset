"Echolord","2017-02-12T01:03:01.977Z","For a Retired Police Commissioner, You Look Pretty Good.","<p>In previous years, the LEGO Collectable Minifigure Series, CMS for short, has left something to be desired in my opinion. Previous series have always had high quality minifigures, but seem to be grasping at strings for ideas.</p>

<p>When the LEGO Batman Movie series of the CMS was revealed, I knew that this issue had changed, and had finally been solved. Twenty great minifigures were designed, and I knew I had to get some of them.</p>

<p>Once I had decided which ones I wanted, I set off. I had never gone looking for the CMS specifically before, so this was a new experience for me. After spending about an hour, maybe more at my local LEGO brand Store, I was successful, and had acquired the minifigures I wanted.</p>

<p>The second&nbsp;of these was the Commissioner Gordon&nbsp;minifigure. The overall print looks great, and he is by far the best of the three different versions of this character.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After assembling him, which was only a few seconds worth of work, and had I not been talking at the time, would have taken even less, I was thoroughly impressed with the minifigure as a whole.</p>

<h3>The Parts</h3>

<p>The head is exclusive to this figure, with a single sided head that has a weary expression, large mustache, whiskers, and comedically&nbsp;oversized glasses. The face captures the character of Jim Gordon quite well, and I hope this remains true for future versions of the character (Can we hope for the Batman movie in 2019?)</p>

<p>The torso is also exclusive, and very similar to the vest his daughter wears in Arkham&nbsp;Asylum (70912). He wears a ruffled tie over a worn white shirt, that is continued onto the dual molded arms, and printed on top of that! The design is great, showing the shoulder holster he wears on the front, and all the straps for it on his back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The legs are again very similar to Barbara Gordon&#39;s, and to Chief O&#39;Hara&#39;s legs in the 853651 Accessory Pack. The design is great, with the belt, and badge on his thigh.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His hair is a new mold, in dark stone gray, with some lighter highlights on the sideburns. The piece looks great, and I predict some great uses of this piece in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wanted poster of the Joker is simple, and looks great! It shows Joker in the vest from the Notorious Low Rider (70906), with his red lipstick being the only color shown on the sketch of the super villain.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall Verdict:</h3>

<p>Wow. I hadn&#39;t been able to get the 2013 Commissioner Gordon, and this one is, in my opinion, far superior to the one in the Scuttler. The print quality is great, and the character is captured in minifigure form so well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Foil Pack Feel Tips</h3>

<p>Find the Radio. Or the hair. That works too.</p>

<p>He&#39;s got a dual-sided torso print for his rumpled looking uniform, dual-molded arms with some side printing to show he has creases in his sleeves and some minor printing on his legs including his badge. For accessories he comes with the standard walkie talkie piece and a printed tile showing that, yes, The Joker is wanted.</p>

<p>Everything about this Minifigure looks pretty good and so I&#39;d recommend him, especially for his parts. So far we haven&#39;t had a single dud in the lot, however there are many more reviews still to come.</p>

<p>Commissioner Gordon is one of my personal favourite batman non hero allies and this figure of him is perfect in every way .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The hair is a part that was new for this figure and it has subtle side printing , the head is perfect showing a beaten down Gordon with a moustache stubble and glasses , the torso has this tie jacket and dual moulded arms with rolled up sleeve prints and the legs feature a belt and a police badge .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>The accessories are a standard black walkie talkie and a printed 2&times;2 white tile of a joker wanted poster which would work well in mass . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a great figure and is my second favourite of the series , there is nothing wrong with it so I widely recommend it .</p>
