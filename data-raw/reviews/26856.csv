"8BrickMario","2017-02-06T01:31:10.617Z","""By Ra, I must be dreaming! Since when did Egypt become so advanced?""","<p>King Tut is one of those characters best suited to the CMF range- a nerd&#39;s dream, but not hugely desirable to the general public. Is he worth it?<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are very useful- the torso in particular, due to its lack of skin printing. The Series 2 Pharaoh&#39;s staff makes a welcome return, and if you somehow don&#39;t have a snake, he&#39;s got one of those, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Minifigure</h3>

<p>This is the original William Omaha McElroy, the villain featured first in the 1966&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>&nbsp;TV series. As such, he looks just like the character, with his white headress, red robes, and striped skirt underneath. His face has a great lazy/skeptical expression, and he has a cape to finish off the look.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Overall&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Get him if you like the original show and/or have the according Batcave set. Otherwise, he&#39;s probably not hugely important to have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>King Tut is a reference many fans will get of 60&#39;s Batman, re-runs on old tevlevision stations always featured many fun episodes and I always had a blast when King Tut showed up as the villain because of my love of Egyptian themed characters. This Minifigure just looks great and screams awesome. His print is really fun, with a great use of dual-molded legs for the bare foot look, his accessories are also awesome, I love the cobra headed staff and his headdress is always impressive, especially with the printing details here. The only downside is he is given an old-school LEGO snake in green instead of the new Cobra piece from the Snake Charmer... it might have been nice to see that new piece in a dark black colour scheme or dark maroon to match his costume.</p>

<p>I definitely can&#39;t recommend King Tut enough, he is awesome. His parts are great too, I love the staff and it makes for an excellent accessory for custom Cobra Commanders in LEGO form. Strongly recommended.</p>

King Tut first appeared in the Batman 60&#39;s tv show (the same one Lego made the bat cave&nbsp;about ). He is a very detailed mini figure which represents the character well in Lego. He will go perfectly with any classic Batman display.</p>

<p>King tut is a good figure with great printed dual moulded legs and a 50|50 on the accessories being interesting .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The figure has a nice head dress with gold printing , a disgruntled facial expression , a red older style cape , an alright torso , and some great printed legs which are dual moulded and a have interesting side prints .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>The accessories include a green snake and a very cool snake head staff . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a good figure but like calculator they just don&#39;t stand out from the series but I guess I still recommend it .</p>
