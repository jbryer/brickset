"ThoughtLash","2017-01-17T19:15:19.79Z","Heavy Metal Never Dies!","<p>Okay, that was a Power Metal reference (Iron Savior), not Glam Metal, but whatever. I love both. As a huge fan of metal, I NEEDED to get this set.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The typical Minifigures bag, this time yellow and decorated with a mess of Batmen and villains. Looks pretty neat, and is definatley eye-catching (caught mine!).</p>

<p>The instructions are also typical Minifigures fare, a small folded piece of paper with a checklist on one side and instructions on the back. Glam Metal Batman is number 5 in this series and on the checklist.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>No new pieces here, aside from prints. Most are either black or silver, and in the case of the legs, torso and&nbsp;cowl have some of both. The&nbsp;cowl is the old style with the chin strap and is in the traditional black, but with a silver Batsymbol over the eyes. This makes it look quite like one of the members of KISS, or for a darker feel corpse paint.</p>

<p>The torso is black with an exposed chest print. The front is studded, and the arms have silver to represent a continuation of the M&ouml;tley Cr&uuml;e-esque shoulder armor. Speaking of, this is a silver version of the armor worn by the Gundabad Orcs in <em>The Hobbit</em> sets.</p>

<p>Glam Metal Batman&#39;s legs are dual-molded black and silver, with the silver again representing armor. These are nicely printed and look great.</p>

<p>Interestingly for a Minifigures series, Batman&#39;s head it flesh. It is printed with a snarling expression, useful for when&nbsp;he needs to look angry during a guitar solo. The final pieces are the cape, the typical modern jagged Batman cape, and the guitar. Interestingly, if you follow the packaging Batman plays this Explorer-lookalike lefty. The guitar is black and silver to match Batman himself.</p>

<p>Of course, a basic stand is included as well. This is a 3x4 plate with four studs on top.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>Really quick, basically the typical Batman minifigure with the addition of armor. Over in a couple seconds. The only slightly difficult part is finding which direction the armor should face, as there is a slight difference on each side.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>Glam Metal Batman certainly looks the part, both as a member of a metal band and as Batman. Interesting how well the two ideas fit together. Again, as a metal fan I just had to get this little set,&nbsp;and I really like him.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>Out of all the minifigures in this series, Glam Metal Batman is by far my favorite. On attempting to find him, feel for the distinct&nbsp;Explorer shape and the shoulderpads, which aren&#39;t hard to miss. Definitely pick him up sometime!</p>

"GinoPane","2017-02-01T08:49:08.027Z","Metal is Forever!","<p><strong>Overall appearance</strong></p>

<p>First of all, this mini-figure was the one that I was really keen to find from the moment I saw it in the showcase in&nbsp;the LEGO store.</p>

<p>I mean, in the world of pop-culture we got a stunning LEGO mini-figure which look like&nbsp;quintessence of the metal spirit. The appearance is inspired by&nbsp;KISS costumes probably (compare to this picture: <a href=""http://www.aceshowbiz.com/images/wennpic/kiss-motley-crue-announce-co-headlining-tour-40.jpg"">scene photo</a>). Black and sometimes dark-dark gray colors look stylish and aggressive, dangerous-looking shoulder armor complements the image. Mouth is widely opened, guitar is in action, so definitely Batman has been caught in concert rage, and I like it.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p>Almost always I have problems with cloaks, and this figure is not an exception. Shoulder armor thorns make&nbsp;a little challenging to put on the Batman&#39;s cape. This armor also prevents arms from lifting up. If you&#39;re interested, please have a look at the video with building process&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtBomX01qPk"">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Final words</strong></p>

<p>My friend, who is not a LEGO fan at all, was so impressed by this mini-figure, so he purchased only it for himself and decorated his desk with it.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-09-10T20:52:52.217Z","Shout it out Loud!","<p><strong>Set #71017 Glam Metal Batman:</strong> The Dark Knight really loves to party and write his own broody musical pieces, whenever he feels the need to be creative he&#39;ll climb into his Glam Metal costume and rock-out.</p>

<p>Inspired by the look of KISS, this Batman costume is just awesome incarnate. It&#39;s all black with some dark silver highlight colour choices, his legs feature dual-molding, as is customary these days for such designs. The print looks great and many will obviously use it to make their own KISS Band members. The spiky shoulder armour piece and the guitar element with new silver detailing on the print enhance an already impressive looking costume for our favorite caped crusader. Even the cowl doesn&#39;t escape the fun level of detail with a silver Bat Symbol printed around the eye holes.</p>

<p>Overall this is a great looking alternative costume for LEGO Batman and another must-have figure from this series of the LEGO CMF line.</p>

"RavioliGalNotGuy","2017-03-24T02:05:01.72Z","Far Exceeded My Expectations ","<p>I got this minifigure from Walmart, finding it by feeling through the blind&nbsp;bags one by one. This was the second one I felt, and it is an obvious find, as the armor is distinct.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigure is stellar, the torso is perfect for MOC rock bands. The head has a black band with the impression of eyes being squeezed shut, and the mouth looks like it is yelling out a song or... something. Anyway, it is perfect for staging the &quot;I&#39;m Batman&quot; song from the movie. The cowl is exclusive and cannot be used for anything else. The cape and armor create a feel of the cape being fluffed up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So yeah, that pretty much wraps things up, so...</p>

<p>See ya!</p>

"SuperBrixBros","2017-10-06T00:40:13.13Z","Batman Rocks!","<p>Legs: Nice silver and black printing, with bats on the knees and zigzags on the feet.&nbsp; The black belt has printed holes and is clasped with a silver bat.</p>

<p>Torso: The shirt is open to reveal a muscular torso and the muscles continue on to be seen through the shirt (which might be the only occurrence ever).&nbsp; There are a couple of black sections on the arm and a dotted design on the shirt to sum it up.</p>

<p>Cape: This isn&#39;t your average lego cape.&nbsp; It is made of the normal lego&nbsp;cape material, but has a nice curvy end.</p>

<p>Armor: Nice silver armor with four spikes (two on each side).&nbsp; It covers only the shoulder and neck and limits the movement of the arms like most lego&nbsp;armor.</p>

<p>Head: This batman&nbsp;head has a black strip over the forehead instead of the normal white one.&nbsp; The eyebrows are printed on top of the strip so that they look like closed eyes with the bat-mask on.&nbsp; The mouth is open in a &quot;yeaaaaah!&quot;, but not a loud one.</p>

<p>Headgear: This bat-mask is the normal mold, but has a silver bat printed around the eyeholes.</p>

<p>Guitar: Great printing on this guy.&nbsp; The mold is awesome, too.&nbsp; It has the pegs and the brackets and the shape of the thing is just perfect.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all! Thanks!</p>
