"Loerwyn","2017-01-07T10:40:19.733Z","Orca Returns!","<p>When I saw this figure I researched her, and in the lead up to the release of the LEGO Batman Movie sets she became my favourite Batman character despite her limited appearances. So getting her was a real moment of excitement for me, and I&#39;m glad I have her!</p>

<p>There&#39;s not a lot going for this minifigure, however. She has no accessories and no new parts, and is just a repaint of the Shark Suit Guy minifigure from Series 15. This makes her probably one of the cheapest sets to produce in this series, and potentially one of the most disappointing. Her &#39;headgear&#39; (actually her head - she&#39;s an orca/human hybrid) is inaccurate for the character and the animal, as orcas don&#39;t have gills and the tail fin is at the wrong angle (sharks have a vertical tail, orcas have a horizontal one), whilst Orca herself in the comics doesn&#39;t have a tail - though if she&#39;s in the movie I suspect she will. However, I doubt this will bother kids that much.</p>

<p>The colouring on the minifigure is also disappointing. In the art work (e.g. the official picture, the insert, etc.), the white of her legs matches the printing on her body and head. Sadly, this isn&#39;t true. She has white, printed legs and a black, printed torso so the shades of white are quite different, which is made even stranger by the fact the teeth on the head are closer in colour to the legs, so Orca looks more like she is white, black and grey rather than white and black.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;ve been critical but Orca is the minifigure I wanted the most and I stand by that. She&#39;s a character I really like and I&#39;m so glad to have a physical representation of her. It&#39;s just a shame that she&#39;s easily the worst minifigure in the line, as she has no accessories (unlike every other figure in the range) and limited playability. As a fan, I feel like she would have been much better represented as a Big Fig, like the Hulk, in order to better represent her size and height.</p>

"8BrickMario","2017-02-11T19:19:10.86Z","Haven't scientists learned not to play with animal DNA?","<p>Orca is one of the only villains in the series to be fairly recent and well-involved, and I liked her design, so I decided to pick her up.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>Very specific, except for the head, which would work great with the Series 14 Plant Monster.</p>

<h2>The minifigure</h2>

<p>Grace Balin is the Orca, and she follows the same plot as Man-Bat and Lizard- disabled scientist studies animals, uses said animal&#39;s DNA to try curing disability, turns into mutant version of that animal. As such, her looks is very menacing. She reuses the series 15 shark costume in black, and it&#39;s printed with ferocious white eyebrows and red eyes. Her head underneath is all mouth, done in dark red with black for the interior, and a visible tongue and uvula. Her torso is printed with sharky-humanoid details in white, which very subtly suggest her original feminine figure. She has the flipper-arms in black. Her legs merely continue the patterning.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>I really like her! She&#39;s a bit scary, a bit silly, and a bit awesome all in one, and she makes a good presence.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-09-13T17:24:30.283Z","Holy Aquatic Terror Batman","<p><strong>Set #71017 Orca:</strong> Fusing her DNA with that of a Killer Whale, apparently, Orca is a dangerous Bat villain from DC Comics and this Minifigure captures <strong>her</strong> look quite nicely. Yep, this is actually one of the female characters from this series, who knew?</p>

<p>Orca reuses all of the parts found in Shark Suit Guy, even the head gear is the same, meaning she looks more like a hybrid shark/killer whale than just a Killer Whale. Her legs are surprisingly not Dual-Molded, instead they&#39;re just printed with black markings to resemble the Killer Whale look. She also features some decent torso printing.</p>

<p>Her head is the real gem, it&#39;s a plain dark maroon colour with details for the open mouth with a dangling uvula in the back and a large red whale tongue. Overall this is a silly obscure villain similar to Eraser, but much more menacing looking because of how she&#39;s printed. On top of that she&#39;s actually a girl criminal, really unusual design choice, but still enjoyable and a must have for Villains Completionists. Recommended.</p>

<p>Orca is a villain that I knew nothing of but is fun and interesting as a Minifigure .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The head piece is the reused shark suit guy part in black with orca printing , the head is just a printed mouth for the head attachment , the torso is printed and she has the fin arms in black and the legs are printed and feature side printed .</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is an alright figure that is good at just being another obscure batman villain so I recommend it anyone who wants it .</p>
