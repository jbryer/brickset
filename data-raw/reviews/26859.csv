"Odeinoichus","2017-09-10T21:51:53.923Z","Not the Costume for Her.","<p><strong>Set #71017 Pink Power Batgirl:</strong> When first trying on different costumes Barbara Gordon was seen briefly in this variant costume, ultimately she didn&#39;t like it, however it does look very impressive.</p>

<p>PPB, not to be mistake for PPG, is a very impressive looking Minifigure. She&#39;s got dual-molded legs with pink booties on the bottom and minor printing for a tutu/bikini bottom looking leg print. She&#39;s wearing the new skirt piece first seen in the LEGO Disney Minifigure series, her cape is pink and made with shimmery looking material. She has a pink batarang and her hair piece is unique to her with a nice ponytail in the back. She features two expressions, the happy smiling one and a very displeased frown, she definitely doesn&#39;t like this costume.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d recommend this one, I like the overall look of it and the parts are very enticing, especially that Batarang. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>Pink Power Batgirl was only briefly featured in 2017s &#39;The LEGO Batman Movie&#39; and is in no way a bad Minifigure, however compared to some greats of the series, she isn&#39;t very impactful.</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>She uses the Barbara Gordon hair with a band printed, a mask is printed on both sides of the head accompanying a smiling and stern face print, she has a shiny pink cape, a printed torso with the arms subsequently printed, a pink skirt hip attachment and some dual moulded legs with some minor printing.</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>Her single accessory is a dark pink Batarang which is cool and appropriate. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This is a good Minifigure, there is no doubt about that, but compared to the other 19 of the series, she just isn&#39;t that interesting, therefore I can only really recommend this to people who want them all.</p>
