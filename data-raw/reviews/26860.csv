<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>The Mime has a nice head print that could be used elsewhere, and her lightning bolts and mohawk might also be desirable.</p>

<h2>The minifigure</h2>

<p>Camilla Ortin is a noise-hating&nbsp;villain who uses acrobatics and mime in her villainy. She also has electric gloves...because why not? Honestly, I think the people who created her gave her an awful design, so I&#39;m not faulting LEGO for my not liking her. Her hair is the mohawk piece in dark blue, and her face is shown with some neat white paint depicting classic mime makeup. She has a slight scowl. Her outfit is hideous, being a black leotard over a black-striped pink jumpsuit. The stripes continue onto the sides of her arms and legs, and the details for her studded collar and netted top are also included. Her accessories are two of the classic lightning blasts.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>Get her if you like her design or like having completion, but if you don&#39;t, you&#39;re not missing much.</p>

<p>Mime is a fine figure with two of the same accessory which is a cool and bland piece at the same time .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The hair is the Mohawk piece in dark blue , the face is very emotionless and features face paint , the torso is alright , the arm printing is ok and the legs and side printing are nice .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>The accessories include two of the lightning piece which is overall just fine . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is an alright figure with nothing particularly interesting so I don&#39;t really recommend&nbsp; it unless you are like me and like to get all of the different villains .</p>
