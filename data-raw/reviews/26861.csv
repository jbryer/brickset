I got six of them in mid-December, and one of them was Lobster-Lovin&#39; Batman, my favorite out of all of them.</p>

<p>He comes with six pieces, including the new lobster mold. That, in my opinion is the highlight of this minifigure. He also has a nice robe, a plate garnished with vegetables, and a batmask, which appears in most of the Batman Movie sets. The robes are useful for lots of Lego scenarios ,and the lobster is good for seafood restaurants, as well as underwater vignettes. The fancy plate is always useful to have, as it goes good in restaurants or even a home kitchen My only complaint would be that the mask is so common that it would be nice to see something different for the headgear, but this is not quite&nbsp;fair criticism, since he looks this way in the trailer and most likely in the movie as well.</p>

<p>If you would like to get him, which I strongly reccomend you do, feel for the plate and then the lobster, and confirm it is him with the batmask, whch is entirely enclosed except for the mouth area and two eyeholes.</p>

<p>Like I said, this is my favorite minifig in the series, and I highly reccomend it.</p>

"FowlerBricks","2017-03-07T19:02:14.87Z","I deserve this today, today I deserve this","<p>There is quite a few reviews for this minifigure series flying around out there, so if you are reading this, thank you for reading mine and not the Pro&rsquo;s reviews. Anyway, I&rsquo;d seen a lot of pictures of these guys and after reading some other reviews, I decided to finally get one. From the start, I had wanted this version of Batman, though when I saw the trailer I assumed that he would be some sort of theater promo polybag, kinda like Sleepy Emmet; so when I found out that he came in the minifigure series, I was really happy that he would be a little easier to get. So I went to Walmart and sat in the Lego isle and felt packages. 2/3 of the container later, I found him! Tip: feel for the Bat-cowl first, then the plate. Make sure that you feel the stud on the bottom of the plate or else you may end up with Rubber Ducky Batman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE BOX&hellip;ER, BAG AND INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<p>The bag is very attractive and eye catching packaging. Bright yellow sporting the TLBM logo and pictures of nine of the minifigures. The instructions aren&rsquo;t really instructions, more like a checklist. On the back of the list, there&rsquo;s instructions on how to build some of the more complex minifigs, Batman whacking Joker with a Batarang and a mysterious silhouette of what is thought to be some type of Highwayman. Overall, very well done.</p>

<p>THE PARTS</p>

<p>Well, the mini figure&rsquo;s parts, obviously, plus a really neat lobster, a plate printed with a lettuce leaf and some sauce smears and a minifigure platform. There are two things, okay, really only one thing that bothers me. #1: I wish the minifigure platform or plate or stand or whatever you want to call it was yellow with the TLBM logo or something. It would have added a lot. #2 (the not really legit one): the lobster looks alive, just staring with those little beady eyes, waiting for a chance to escape.</p>

<p>THE MINIFIGURE</p>

<p>The finished minifigure is fantastic! Dual color legs, leg printing, arm printing plus an exclusive face. The level of detail is thoroughly satisfying and the printing feels like good quality printing.</p>

<p>OVERALL</p>

<p>I LOVE THIS MINIFIGURE!! (and you should too!)</p>

<p>He&rsquo;s got great printing plus cool exclusive accessories. The Lobster is a well molded and very cute piece. Batman&rsquo;s heart must be made of stone. How&nbsp;can you eat something this cute? Anyway, Alfred must not have cooked it long enough. Go get this minifig! He&rsquo;s well worth all the package-feeling. Though Batman had better finish cooking his meal&hellip;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-09-10T20:45:13.343Z","His Favorite Meal","<p><strong>Set #71017 Lobster Lovin&#39; Batman:</strong> The LEGO Batman Movie introduced hoards of new Batman outfits, this is Batman in his casual get-up for when he&#39;s chilling around the Cave. And it is also the introduction of another new LEGO Animal piece.</p>

<p>Batman himself comes in a nice Bat-Robe, it&#39;s a dark maroon in colour and has an interesting pattern on it. The print is dual-sided on the torso with side printing on his arms and upper legs, the legs themselves are dual-molded giving us the first bare foot pink skinned LEGO character (if I&#39;m very much not mistaken)</p>

<p>For accessories they include a brand new Lobster piece which has printed eyes on it and looks brilliant. It has a high level of detail, the large dish piece from Taco Tuesday Guy is included with some printed elements showing off a leaf of lettuce and some yellow markings that may be melted remnants of some butter.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d say this is one of the key looks from the movie and one you can&#39;t go wrong with, I highly recommend picking him up. MOC fans will love the parts here too. Strongly recommended.</p>

"SuperBrixBros","2017-10-05T23:54:26.333Z","Lobster LOVIN'","<p>Legs: Great detail!&nbsp; The interlocking bathrobe pattern is incredible!&nbsp; These dual-molded bad boys are one of the three tan barefooted legs:</p>

<p>From one part of the dual-mold to the other, there is an awkward shift of skin color.&nbsp; The official images hide it well, though.</p>

<p>Torso: As the bathrobe makes the shift from legs to torso there is a small &quot;rift&quot; in the design on the front and on the back the design completely starts there.&nbsp; The chest muscles emerging from behind the bathrobe are a nice touch.</p>

<p>Head: Batman&#39;s face has some nice cheekbones and shows off a sporty grin.&nbsp; The forehead is covered by a white strip (as all batman faces are) and a small portion of each eyebrow peeks out below.</p>

<p>Headgear: The &quot;bat-mask&quot; on this batman is the only normal one in this series.&nbsp; All the others are different molds, have different printing, or, in one case, have goggles attatched!</p>

<p>Plate: It&#39;s the normal lego dish mold, but with nice printing of a green cabbage with cheese.&nbsp; Or is that lettuce with mustard?&nbsp; Anyway, this is one of the two lego&nbsp;plates with printing.</p>

<p>And finally...</p>

<p>THE LOBSTER!</p>

<p>Lobster: This is easily the best part of the set (and the reason I bought it).&nbsp; It has two printed eyes, two big claws, six legs, and a tail.&nbsp; It is the only lego lobster ever made.&nbsp; The only grasping point is a tube underneath and it simply rests on the plate, which is not ideal, but overall, it is great!</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all! Thanks!</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2020-12-16T18:55:08.56Z","Great compromise ","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>Lobster-lovin batman is a very good figure from my favourite licenced series with a good compromise from this outfit in the Lego batman movie .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The figure uses the standard batman cowl , a smirking batman expression , his torso shows his exposed 8 pac.....I mean 9 pack with an intricate robe detail , this detail continues on to the legs which have it on the sides and are dual moulded and the arms also have the pattern printed .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>His accessories include a very nice lobster piece first introduced in this figure with little eye prints and the plate features a print of various other goods for batman to have with his lobster . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is one of the best figures from the series and the decision to use dual moulding instead of a cloth piece was a very good change from the film version so I recommend it .</p>
