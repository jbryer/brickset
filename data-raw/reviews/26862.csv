<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build and Pieces: Easy to put together, though I did forget the inner tube before putting on the torso. The flippers are the same old piece that have been around for years. Though I am a bit bummed that they don&#39;t upgrade the feet accessories for the collectable minifigs, so that they can snap onto the display platform.&nbsp;Batman&#39;s cowl is a new all in one piece with goggles attached as molded. The inner tube fits snugly over the legs and decked out in it&#39;s own mask. Making Batman ready for the beach.&nbsp; His outfit is patterned with the bat logo so everyone will know that is Batman out in the ocean fighting against Orca. Or some other villain that finds his way into Gotham&#39;s ocean front.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I bought this through Lego.com. But finding the figure in stores should be super easy because of the inner tube piece or flippers.&nbsp;</p>

"Echolord","2017-02-10T20:04:15.03Z","And of course I have an Indoor Pool. With real Dolphins","<p>In previous years, the LEGO Collectable Minifigure Series, CMS for short, has left something to be desired in my opinion. Previous series have always had high quality minifigures, but seem to be grasping at strings for ideas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the LEGO Batman Movie series of the CMS was revealed, I knew that this issue had changed, and had finally been solved. Twenty great minifigures were designed, and I knew I had to get some of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once I had decided which ones I wanted, I set off. I had never gone looking for the CMS specifically before, so this was a new experience for me. After spending about an hour, maybe more at my local LEGO brand Store, I was successful, and had acquired the minifigures I wanted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first of these was the Vacation Batman minifigure. Two new molded parts, for the cowl and duck floatie;&nbsp;which I predict will reappear in the Coast Guard subtheme of City later this year, and the excellent print quality told me that I needed this figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After assembling him, which was only a few seconds worth of work, and had I not been talking at the time, would have taken even less, I was thoroughly impressed with the minifigure as a whole.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Duck Floatation Device: This piece is probably the main draw of this minifigure for a number of fans, with the excellent new mold, with a bat mask printed on the yellow head. The underside is hollow, allowing the legs to slide through, and connect to the torso, as would be expected. The mold captures the seams and creases that all inflatable pool toys inevitably have, in perfect LEGO form, and the beak and mask are fully printed. And fittingly, and like all ABS plastic LEGO parts, the piece does float. (I had to check)</p>

<p>The Cowl: This cowl looked great from the moment I saw it, with the blue goggles molded perfectly on to the second style Batman Cowl. The eye holes are completely covered, which allows for a standard Bruce Wayne head to be used underneath, without the eye band that usually fills these holes. I cannot tell based on the style of the mold whether or not it is Dual Molded like the arms and legs, but if I had to guess, I would say it is, given how seamless the blue coloration is.</p>

<p>The Torso: Dual molded, and printed arms, with the unbuttoned beach shirt make a great look on Batman, and the issue of the face tan that usually happens when the light nougat color is printed onto black is not a problem here. It looks great, and the print continues onto the back of the minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Legs: Batman Swim Trunks. Every nerd kid probably had a pair of these at some point, and some adults probably have them now. They look great with the dual molded legs that show the edge of the trunks, and the start of his legs underneath them. There is a single yellow bat symbol printed on the left thigh in the front.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Final Verdict</h3>

<p>Having never reviewed a Minifigure only set before, I really didn&#39;t know how to rate it, given my normal system, but I think this figure is very good. High quality print and design work, that merges with new and old parts seamlessly. Overall, I think Batman is ready for a Vacation in his private indoor pool with real dolphins.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Foil Pack Feeling Tips</h3>

<p>Find the Duck. The flippers are probably too small, and get caught in the paper sheet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wearing a new Duck Floaty element and a pair of orange flippers, Vacation Batman features a print that you&#39;d find on any beach in the world for the fashion forward crime fighter. Complete with newly sculpted cowl piece with extra goggles molded on and a little mask printed on his duck floaty, the caped crusader is ready to enjoy sand, sun and surf.</p>

<p>This figure also includes dual-molded legs and arms, once again I find myself strongly recommending a costume variant to track down, if you haven&#39;t found one already.</p>

<p>The vacation batman is a good figure with a very nice hip attachment and a surprising face print .&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure has a dual moulded cowl introduced with this figure with goggle screen printing , a Bruce Wayne face with a large grin , a batman themed Hawaiian shirt with dual moulded arms continuing that pattern , a very cool nightwing themed floating duckie , and some dual moulded batman branded swim shorts .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>His only accessory is a pair of generic orange flippers which are useful but just not interesting . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a figure who is Out of place in this series as the swimsuit batman from the Lego batman movie series two swimsuit batman fits better as this vacation figure fits better with the other series two vacation characters and I still do recommend it .</p>
