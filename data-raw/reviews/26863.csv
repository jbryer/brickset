<p>Compared to some other minifigures in this set, this minifigure is quite neutral in appearance. Therefore, it may even be added to your (World) City sets and collections with no extra effort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A minifigure&nbsp;worth it for collectors and people who wish to expand their police sets alike!</p>

<p>She features some great printing on her torso and the plain uniform has no markings indicating it&#39;s strictly Barbara&#39;s, so you can reuse it for many other characters when you start buying doubles for MOC creations. Her accessories include a pair of handcuffs and the button to the Bat Signal, she also gets a nice new mold head piece with a police hat with hair attached for female officers to use.</p>

<p>Overall a very useful and impressive offering from this CMF series and one I would definitely recommend.</p>

"Hashem1983","2018-07-03T08:17:46.117Z","A Pleasant Surprise","<p>This Figure was a very pleasant surprise to me and that&#39;s because of the special&nbsp;mold for the head accessory, the police hat with hair coming down beneath rather than to have it without hair, it gives it a special look.</p>

<p>The torso is printed on both side, the legs are solid dark blue, but the arms are printed with GCPD&nbsp;logo and the hands are in white to represent the&nbsp;&nbsp;white gloves.</p>

<p>Nothing special about the accessories, you just get a handcuff and a Batman button which is only a 1x1 black plate with flat 1x1 round plate in yellow printed on it the Batman logo, but its too difficult for the hand to grab it.</p>

<p>For my final touch, I added a gold&nbsp;epaulet&nbsp;from my spare collection that gave her a much better look.</p>

<p>Overall, you can use this figure either with the theme or in your city police or just as a display.</p>

<p>I really liked it quite a lot.</p>
