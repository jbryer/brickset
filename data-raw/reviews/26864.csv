<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>I could see all of his parts being reapplied by creative builders, except maybe his visor.</p>

<h2>The minifigure</h2>

<p>The Calculator is &nbsp;Noah Kuttler, a mathematical genius who records his defeats by heroes to analyze them and prevent their strategies&nbsp;from ever being used&nbsp;again. His outfit is fairly faithful to the comics, too. Starting from the top, he has a white helmet with square patterns and a visor with LCD numbers, which, in upside-down calculator speak, reads &quot;hello&quot;. His head underneath is lavender with the exposed face printed on it, and he has a sinister grin. Under the helmet, he wears a bulky armor piece with a printed tile representing a number pad for a calculator. The design he&#39;s based on is a much sleeker suit, so I think a frontward-facing white neck bracket might have been a better mount for the tile. Underneath, his lavender torso is printed with muscle detail and a white belt, and the square patterns also feature on his arms and the sides of his legs. The legs are dual-molded to show his white boots.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>He&#39;s not a design I&#39;m in love with, but he&#39;s still nicely done and is a nice addition to the cast.</p>

<p>Calculator looks great, he&#39;s got dual-molded legs with some side printing on the top portion, some interesting looking detailing on his arms and torso which look like the buttons on a calculator and a bulky armour piece that is relatively rare outside of CMF series. His helmet features some nice printing with a great joke on the visor, and he has a printed tile piece for the calculator buttons... sadly he doesn&#39;t include any slide-rule accessories or anything else that would fit in with his calculating theme.</p>

<p>Overall he&#39;s a nice solid offering and a pretty strong one, his parts are all fun especially as they are a nice light purple in colour which is a rare colour to see on Minifigures. Strongly recommended.</p>

<p>Calculator is just one of those batman villains that you just can&#39;t take seriously eg(polka dot man , zebra man , calendar man , more man , condiment king ect ) But this figure is still good despite the characters goofiness .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure uses the standard white helmet with printing ontop , a visor with hello printed on it upside down like the old calculator trick , a lavender coloured head with a large grin , the neck attachment is the bulky armour piece with a single stud at the front and back with a 1&times;1 printed button print on a light grey tile , a nice torso with good arm printing and dual moulded legs with side printing .</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a good figure with lots of detail but doesn&#39;t stand out loads with the rest of the figures of the series but I still recommend it .</p>
