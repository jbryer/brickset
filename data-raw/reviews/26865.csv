"Tediousity","2016-12-31T01:46:11.94Z","Weird but good","<p>This guy is odd. I mean, he&#39;s literally dressed like a pencil! But&nbsp;he&#39;s also a really cool figure. His headpiece is an entirely new mold which has a slight yellow bit on the bottom,&nbsp;lessening its play value slightly, but it has a stud on top which you put the 1x1 pink round tile on.&nbsp;He&#39;s got penciltips printed on his feet and lines on every part of his body. &nbsp;His paper is kind of funny but rather odd.</p>

<p>All in all, great! I might use the torso and legs for a Number Two (Mysterious Benedict Society) MOC figure.</p>

"8BrickMario","2017-02-06T01:38:30.813Z","Surprisingly NOT erased from memory!","<p>This is an oddball choice, but this guy is a very real Batman rogue who goes way back.&nbsp;Is he just a silly novelty or a worthy addition to the rogues gallery?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>His parts are fairly limited, but his torso and head piece could be applied to different situations.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Minifigure</h3>

<p>The Eraser is Lenny Fiasco, a former classmate of Bruce Wayne&#39;s, who serves as a behind-the-scenes guy who destroys evidence and covers up crimes. His pencil-themed costume is delightfully ridiculous, and it starts with his helmet. This is a new piece which includes the silver eraser guard and the yellow section at the neck, and it has two circular eyes printed on it. The piece is topped off by a pink tile. I like the look of this, but it feels odd that the head is narrower than a minifigure head- it doesn&#39;t look like a convincing helmet, and I thought he was a robot because of it.</p>

<p>His outfit is a pinstriped yellow suit with a black cravat and gloves. On his toes are an original detail- designs representing the drawing end of a pencil!</p>

<p>His accessory is a yet-to-be-filled to-erase list printed on a 2x2 tile. I wish they had actually listed some items.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I&#39;d recommend him. He&#39;s a shining example of the silly fun comics have, and it&#39;s a sign of the desperately-needed humor&nbsp;that this movie is bringing back to DC.<br />

"Odeinoichus","2017-09-13T17:12:21.767Z","Holy Obscure Villains Batman","<p><strong>Set #71017 Eraser:</strong> A villain from DC Comics I don&#39;t know a whole lot about, The LEGO Batman Movie decided to include as many of them as possible, and Eraser is a fairly interesting looking minifigure.</p>

<p>Dressed in an orange striped suit, Eraser features some very unique printing, his feet even have the standard looking Number 2 Pencil led printed on the front, in fact he looks like a walking Number 2 Pencil considering the eraser tip for a head. Eraser is quirky looking and fun, and would fit in nicely with the odd costumed characters we&#39;ve gotten in the past.</p>

<p>Overall a pretty odd-ball figure that looks quite charming, his little To Erase list, which seems to be finished with, is a fun little bonus. I strongly recommend him, especially for his unique printed parts.</p>

<p>The Eraser is a DC villain I was surprisingly familiar with before the release of the &#39;LEGO Batman Movie&#39; and I always loved his design, and is Minifigure variant is brilliant in representing the goofy character and making a fun minifig.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>He has a 1&times;1 pink round tile for the eraser/rubber part of his head, a unique dual moulded head for a pencil topper with eyes printed, his torso is almost pin-stripes running down including his arms, his legs also have this detail continuing even on the sides, along with the feet having the pencil too printed.</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>His singular included accessory is a 2&times;2 white tile with a notepad print claiming &#39;To Erase&#39; which isn&#39;t very useful. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This is a great Minifigure with no flaws however, the accessory is not very good as its uses are restricted heavily, anyway I highly recommend this Minifigure to DC fans alike.</p>
