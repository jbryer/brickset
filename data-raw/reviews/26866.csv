<p>After getting Lobster Lovin&rsquo; Batman, I had to get a couple more TLBM minifigures, &lsquo;cause they&rsquo;re just so cool. So today I&rsquo;m going to review Dick Grayson aka Robin. Robin is a little bit hard to find, since he has no large recognizable pieces so if you&rsquo;re trying to get him the cylinder and the nozzle are the first things to feel for, then his hair, though since the TLBM minifigure series is ending, you may just want to get him off Bricklink.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BOX/INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same as Lobster Lovin&rsquo; Batman</p>

<p>PARTS</p>

<p>Mainly Robin&rsquo;s parts, but a yellow nozzle and a blue cylinder are included, but I&rsquo;ll get to those in a minute.</p>

<p>THE BUILD</p>

<p>Umm&hellip;well, it was really easy, since&hellip;you know&hellip;it was just sticking the fig together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE COMPLETED MODEL</p>

<p>I have to say, I think Robin is my #1 favorite TLBM mystery minifigure.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/9uxripsgj/09.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s not to love? We get Robin exactly like we see in the Batcave, plus the shark repellent (which is especially useful if you have the 60&rsquo;s Batcave).</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/5uv7k7rdf/Robin2.png"" style=""width: 200px; height: 184px;"" />&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/66cnwz7tf/Robin.png"" style=""width: 250px; height: 204px;"" /></p>

<p>While Robin has neither dual colored arms or legs or arm printing, he&rsquo;s still an excellent minifigure. We can&rsquo;t expect tons of print on all minifigs. His hair and glasses combo is such a fun piece!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/sw77c81n7/06.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>I could spend hours just trying it on other minifigs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hmm&hellip;what about Thor?</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/h5t9uu8ur/05.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>Or Aragorn?</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/mq5r5h7pv/02.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>Or&hellip;or Green Lantern?</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ijkwq5843/04.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>Okay, just one more: Vision!&hellip;ew. Yuck. That&rsquo;s just creepy.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/jxcjlg7df/03.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>Robin&rsquo;s torso print is really nice and I love the little embroidered robins on his sweater.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/56hrnj39v/07.jpg"" style=""width: 200px; height: 150px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/3sq4s840j/08.jpg"" style=""width: 200px; height: 150px;"" /></p>

<p>His legs are simple, but also nicely printed. Now, the shark repellent! There is only one word that adequately describes it: PERFECTION!! There is no possible way that Lego could have done better. Let&rsquo;s just leave it at that.</p>

<p>OVERALL</p>

<p>PROS: Everything!</p>

<p>CONS: None!</p>

<p>You should most definitely get him! He&rsquo;s way worth it!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-09-10T21:45:59.967Z","Bat Shark Repellant!","<p><strong>Set #71017 Dick Grayson:</strong> No crazy costumes, just ordinary Dick Grayson before he takes on the mantle of Robin, and a pretty decent figure to get from this CMF Series, seeing as how he was not offered in any sets.</p>

<p>Dick has double-sided printing on his torso for his red sweater, his pants are plain and unadorned save for the belt and pockets, overall this is a pretty decent Minifigure for casual clothes and multiples will grant you a lot of parts to use for your own creations. his hair piece is wild looking and very fun, the big bottle-lense glasses make his eyes look very big and his included accessory is an iconic piece of Batman history. The Shark Repellant Bat-Spray was used to great effect in the first Batman motion picture from the 1960&#39;s.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d recommend tracking this character down, mostly for parts, but also because he isn&#39;t found in any of the sets in this outfit.</p>

<p>Duck Grayson is a character who rarely appears out of his robin alter ego and this figure is perfect .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The figure has a dual moulded hair glasses combo with printed eyes , a very happy smiling face print , a useful jumper print with a you guessed it robin pattern and some great printed legs showing jeans with a belt .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>His accessory is great as it is shark repellent from the 60s batman show spin off movie &#39;The Batman movie&#39; released&nbsp;in 1966 it has all of the appropriate prints and is amazing . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this may be my favourite of this series but I still feel as if there is much to love for the non batman nerds ( although I am definitely on the opposing side #batmanisthebesthero ) with the torso and legs respectable prints so I recommend it to all .</p>
