<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts here are pretty good. The red &quot;Batman-template&quot; cape, the guns, and the torso can all be applied to new contexts, and it&#39;s nice to see the Freeze&#39;s new dome-helmet armor used simultaneously here.</p>

<h3>The Minifigure</h3>

<p>This&nbsp;Red Hood, in the outward appearance, originated in as a costume shared by a criminal gang to retain anonymity. The man who becomes the Joker takes&nbsp;the costume for a job that ends with him falling into the chemicals at Ace that transform him. Since, he&#39;s used the costume from time to time to commit crimes.</p>

<p>However, the Red Hood is also an identity&nbsp;used by Jason Todd, the resurrected second Robin. The classic costume has been worn by Todd, but he often takes on a biker-like appearance with a smaller helmet, as seen in the Killer Croc Sewer Smash set.</p>

<p>So the minifigure seems very classic, with the dome piece in red for the helmet, and the armor here in red, too. As the minifigure requires the armor as an adapter instead of the &quot;dome-and-suit&quot; look of the comics, the suit&#39;s bow tie is printed on the front. Underneath, the suit is black with a purple waistcoat, tie, and gloves (very Joker-y). The classic suit is often depicted with white accents instead. However, under the helmet is Jason Todd&#39;s mask, making the character ambiguous. I think it&#39;s a good move, as the minifigure quite literally encompasses the Red Hood.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He has two small pistols, introduced in the Star Wars sets.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I very much recommend this minifigure. The creative liberties here are more subtle, and it&#39;s a great dual-representation of the Hood.&nbsp;</p>

Many consider this look to be the version the Joker used before he became the Joker according to DC Comics History.</p>

<p>Red Hood features two machine gun accessories and a very nice black suit with purple under vest, this is a single-sided torso print. The large dome uses a nice shoulder armour piece to hold the red dome on top covering his face, which reveals a red mask underneath.</p>

<p>Red Hood is a very nice villain and includes a red cape, which is different from Superman&#39;s typical cape piece, this is a red version of Batman&#39;s cape. So overall I&#39;d say he&#39;s a pretty strong offering from the series, not only for the look of the figure, but the unique parts. Strongly recommended.</p>
