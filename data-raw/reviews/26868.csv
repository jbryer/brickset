<p>Parts</p>

<p>Her pieces are nice, and have reuse potential.</p>

<h2>The minifigure</h2>

<p>March Harriet is a member of the Mad Hatter&#39;s Wonderland Gang, and serves as one of his thugs. Her minifigure also makes his glaring absence even worse. They made the proper hat with the new Penguin and his henchgal, so where is he? She reuses the Series 7 Bunny Suit Guy&#39;s hood, in a departure from her official design. In the comics, she has short hair and a bunny headband, but I totally get why they toned down the obvious connotations of her design and they probably didn&#39;t want such a hairpiece to be made available, either. The hood, and her whole costume, takes the color of a nougat brown. Her face has a nice grin with a slight squint on her left eye, and brown lipstick. Her outfit is nice, with a white ribbon collar and a furry costume, and she has arm cuffs and white gloves. While the design is compacted on her legs, they depict the bottom of her skirt, her black stockings, and her boots. Her accessory is a tommy gun.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>I actually really like her. While it&#39;s extremely odd that she would be made before her boss, she&#39;s a fun design and a good character to have.</p>

The same applies to my family. However, while shopping last weekend, I suggested passing by the Lego aisle of the local department store just to &quot;have a look&quot;, and my daughter demanded that we buy &quot;something&quot;, and the only thing she could convince me of was &quot;the bunny&quot; shown on the Batman movie minifigures box because &quot;it&#39;s cute&quot;.</p>

<h3>The box</h3>

<p>...is actually non-transparent plastic foil, of course.The figure&#39;s headgear does not resemble that of any other in the series, so the set is easy enough to identify by feeling. I do not remember seeing from images on the series&#39; box whether there are any accessories included, so we did not have any other part to confirm, but that was not necessary.</p>

<h3>The parts</h3>

<p>There&#39;s a brown hood with&nbsp;bunny ears, a flesh-colored head with a facial expression that can be interpreted as friendly or mischievous and a black accessory that my daughter eventually identified as a &quot;pistol&quot;, all of which may be useful in other settings.</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s the upper body: same shade of brown (nougat?!) and flesh-colored arms with ...something... on the side. I had to google images of the comic character to get an idea what these are supposed to be (whatever these pieces of clothing are called, they are supposed to wrap around the whole wrists). The character is wearing an off-shoulder dress usually, but since the torso&#39;s top has flesh-colored printing only on the front and back I would not have guessed that by looking at the figure alone.</p>

<p>The legs -- in the same color for the most part -- also include some printing, but only on the front and sides, which looks a bit like undergarment leaking out somewhere. Again I could not guess from the Lego minifigure what the comic character might actually be wearing.</p>

<h3>Overall thoughts</h3>

<p>This is an interesting minifigure that <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/152121954@N02/33330422295/in/pool-3447329@N23/"">does not look out of place in an&nbsp;Easter scene</a> (sans &quot;pistol&quot;). Fans of the comic character should have a close look at the image and decide whether figure resembles the source material sufficiently -- for me,&nbsp;the deviations are actually a positive aspect.</p>

<p>In the store, on sale next to the minifigures box was the polybag&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30522-1/Batman-in-the-Phantom-Zone"">30522:&nbsp;Batman in the Phantom Zone</a>, which includes a minifigure with accessory and a good number of parts to actually build something, to&nbsp;be bought for less than this figure alone (3.49 vs 3.99&euro;), so I think the price of this one is way off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>March Harriet looks quite impressive, she looks slightly provocative, but that&#39;s the entire point. Dangerous villainous rabbit themed character with a sub-machine gun to fight Batman. She has some pretty good detailed printing for her dual-sided torso print, and it&#39;s nice to see a re-used Bunny Suit Guy head piece in a new colour for different Easter themed costumed characters. There&#39;s some nice side prints on her arms and legs too, a pity she doesn&#39;t have two expressions though, this series has been rather lacking in the dual-sided facial expressions.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d recommend this for fans of villains and the parts are a nice re-use potential as well.</p>

"ninbricks","2017-09-12T19:23:34.517Z","a good playmate for DEADPOOL","<p>The LEGO Batman Movie really shows us some of the most bizarre, funny, or - dare I say - sexiest villains of &quot;the guy with the cape&quot;. Here we have March Harriet, a gunslinging grifter and escort clad in a rabbit-outfit. This one has a very &quot;nasty&quot; approach, dressed in her lingerie and with her bunny-ears she resembles the classic pinup/playmate. And I wonder how or why the designer of the figure got past the &quot;parental advisory board&quot;.</p>

<p>I really like the return of the tommy gun as her private accessory, cause it makes her really shine like a dangerous villain. And in a LEGO-comic-figure-crossover she is one of the hottest candidates to accompany the MARVEL-Weirdo DEADPOOL.</p>

<p>March Harriet is a fun figure with an accurate accessory and great leg and arm printing .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The bunny head attachment is in a light nugat colour and some ear printing , a maniacal looking smile , an interesting torso and arm printing and some detailed legs and great side printing .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>The only accessory is an accurate Tommy gun which I believe was introduced in the Indiana Jones sets . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a good figure with fun prints and just works as a side kick / background villain so I recommend it .</p>
