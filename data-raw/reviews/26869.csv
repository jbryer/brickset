<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>All of his parts are very specific, but the fish might be useful if you don&#39;t have one, and the crab is new in silver and might make a nice architectural piece.</p>

<h2>The minifigure</h2>

<p>The Zodiac Master is an unidentified fraud hero, who played Syndrome&#39;s game- he claimed he could predict disasters, which came true and he was seen as a valuable source of information. Of course, he had set up all of the accidents he predicted so he could get himself some positive attention. His costume is very faithful to the comics, with a blue hood with a &quot;Z&quot; symbol and curled eye holes, and his blue costume, which is covered in golden astrological zodiac signs. His detail features on his arms, legs,&nbsp;and back, which is great. His two accessories are possibly weapons or maybe just symbolic- they&#39;re a silver fish for Pisces and crab for Cancer. A silver bow for Sagittarius would have been appropriate, too, but I&#39;m glad they went with the silly approach.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>He&#39;s a great figure with a fun and detailed design. I could see his schtick inspiring a lot of play scenarios, too, so I recommend him.</p>

<p>Zodiac Master&#39;s schtick is that he is a villain who is obsessed with the signs of the Zodiac. To that end this minifigure includes a silver crab and a silver fish to represent Pisces and Cancer. His costume is printed with all of the twelve signs of the zodiac in the... I want to say Greek Alphabet, but I&#39;m not 100% sure on that, but the costume is very interesting while still being slightly generic looking due to the nature of his printed head covered by a mask similar to Cap or other hooded mask wearing characters.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re trying to get all of the villains you&#39;re going to want this guy, if you want a lot of silver crabs to decorate something in your LEGO MOC City display or Aquazone display I&#39;d definitely recommend him for that unique looking crab element at such a cheap price. Although the price hike to 5$ is a bit... unfortunate. Still recommended.</p>
