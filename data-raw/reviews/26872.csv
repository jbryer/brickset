This, in my opinion, is a mixed bag. On the one hand I&rsquo;m a bit disappointed that we&rsquo;ve lost the multiple different models to be built with a single group of parts, on the other it is nice to find so many interesting models that was built by a Master Builder and showcased in such a promising and enjoyable format.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This is a great chance compared to the Brickmaster format, these books are now easy to read and flip through the pages without a cumbersome front cover included on the front of the book.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The covers of the book and slip case are relatively similar, the page layout pops quite nicely with a lot of fun shots and excellent write-ups on sections of the builds and the instructions for the model are top notch. Overall a great presentation.</span></span></span></span></p>

The included Minifigure is Green Lantern, AKA John Stewart, and he features a very nice print, quite similar to Hal Jordan&rsquo;s Green Lantern from the Sinestro set. He still fails to feature a Minifigure green lantern ring accessory unfortunately.</span></span></span></span></p>

There is still a little overarching story, as was found in some of the later Brickmaster books, however now we are shown a lot of models built by a contributing Master Builder. These are used as part of the story narrative and are meant to be inspirational models for the readers to try and mimic with parts from their collection.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">There&rsquo;s a lot of great details for how these things are built, and a convenient breakdown of certain sections of the builds with more information on how to replicate the look. There are also some nice detailed write-ups on AFOL terminology for standard LEGO parts. (Admittedly some of the terms seem interchangeable.)</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The instructions for the model included are also quite nice, and there is always something fun to read while the younger builder is exploring the adventure happening in the pages of the book.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

It is similar to older LEGO Ideas catalogues from the early to late 80&rsquo;s, only instead of showing how to build stuff they explain the best methods to achieve certain building techniques helping to inspire younger builders to start MOCing stuff.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The &lsquo;adventure&rsquo; aspect of the book is quite entertaining as well, from an AFOL perspective it may feel a bit simple, but it is designed to excite and motivate young readers and to that end it does its job perfectly. I would wholeheartedly recommend this new style of book with parts for anyone who is interested in it. There have been a handful of them so far with certain key themes, this one is the second licensed book made available, Star Wars came first. But where Star Wars included a fairly generic Minifigure you get a new hero we haven&rsquo;t seen before. Strongly recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>

"J14T14","2019-11-05T14:42:15.987Z","This Book will Make Your Friends Green with Envy","<p>I am not a huge DC fan, but I love exclusive LEGO Minifigures, so I had to pick this up and give it a shot. Personally, all I know about Green Lantern is that he can make things with his ring and that Ryan Renalds&nbsp;regrets being a part of that character&#39;s movie. Even with this little knowledge, I still really enjoyed this book and the build that comes with it.</p>

<p>The build itself is a fun little thing and it comes with some rarer pieces in trans green that are a nice inclusion in my parts inventory. The back two fins can be rotated around in different positions and the three back propeller pieces can be angled up and down. This allows you to customize the look of your craft a bit and it is a nice touch. There are two stud shooters in the front that don&#39;t stick out too much and don&#39;t look bad on the model as they are built-in&nbsp;pretty well.</p>

<p>The John Stewart Minifigure looks good when compared to the comics. It was fun looking up the story behind this character and I think that LEGO captured his look perfectly. One thing that I wish was different though is his legs. They are green with black printing on the front. These really should have been duel molded to capture the look, but we got what we got and it looks pretty good even without duel molded legs.</p>

<p>The book is a fun inclusion with many DC-related builds that are great for inspiring young minds to be creative with their LEGO bricks. Adults probably won&#39;t like this book as much, which is okay since LEGO is a kids&#39; product after all.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great book to pick up. Collectors will enjoy the exclusive Minifigure and kids will enjoy the small build&nbsp;and the book. This is a great thing for people to pick up and I am happy that I was able to grab my copy.</p>
