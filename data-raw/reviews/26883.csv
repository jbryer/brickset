<p>This flash speeder is very well built and sloped of in many places throughout the build .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The turret at the back uses a lightsaber hilt and a jumper connection , the seating area is sloped at the back and the engines are secured in the back , the nose features a sloped design and the sides are also sloped and tiled .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is such a streamline build with all the angles of the flash speeder captured perfectly and I recommend it to many different lego star wars demographics .</p>
