Unfortunately, it seems like a lack of effort pulled this set down, as the money transporter, particularly the front end,&nbsp;was built very lazily and just looks wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box was pretty small, like a standard $12.99/$19.99 set. The instructions are fairly small as well.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>A lot of useful parts are included, like money and gold tiles and gems. Other than that, there are lots of wheels and vehicle parts to build your own vehicle.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The minifigs are good, but another police officer would have been great. The criminal has a red dolly, which seems to be a&nbsp;common color; all the criminals in this wave have red vehicles. I would like more variation, however.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>The build was very short but still very enjoyable.</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Lego is getting more and more juniorized each year it seems.&nbsp;That really comes into play in the money transporter itself. The front end is absolutely hideous. Maybe it&#39;s based off a European truck that&nbsp;I&#39;m unaware of, maybe I&#39;m just nit-picking, but this design makes&nbsp;it looks like something straight out of 4 Juniors.&nbsp;This lack of effort is unexcusable. After seeing what can be done with cars and trucks, this thing&nbsp;is a total&nbsp;letdown. It can be easily rectified, but right out of the box, it just&nbsp;looks ugly. I&nbsp;earnestly hope Lego does not continue on this path of juniorization.&nbsp;They can&nbsp;put more resources into&nbsp;Juniors if they wish, but please, keep it out of City.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
