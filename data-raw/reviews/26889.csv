<p>This book is excellent, and has something to offer both adults and children. The characters represent the LEGO community very well, with the author &#39;Peter&#39;, his assistant builder &#39;Albert&#39;, an adult designer &#39;Ruby&#39;, and a child &#39;Titus&#39; who loves playing with LEGO bricks.</p>

<p>Each chapter deals with a different subject, streetlights, cameras, recycling, sculptures, to name a few. Fun Facts, Top Tips and Building Tips are added on every page, making this book very educational. Some facts are quite simple, while others, like the 27th&nbsp;letter of the alphabet, are fascinating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every model is pocket money sized, which is a good change from seeing massive models that would cost the earth to resource all the parts. A good range of different skills are used for the models, some models are easy to build and use basic parts, while others are more difficult and use parts like the dice piece. I love how the characters build some of the models step-by-step with Minifigure tools. Very fun and creative. Good humour&nbsp;makes this book fun for all the family.</p>

<p><b>Adults</b></p>

<p>You could easily flick through the pages of this book and decide that it&#39;s not for you, but you would be wrong. The story is very interesting, as you read the story you learn about the author. The back of the book says: &quot;See how the author faces his own challenges to prove that, if you put your mind to it, there is nothing you cannot achieve&quot;. The book certainly delivers on this, and in a surprising way, but I won&#39;t add any spoilers here.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Children</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This book has of course been designed with children in mind (just like LEGO sets). Children will love building and learning about the models contained within the pages. The educational value of this book is very high. There are some simple facts,&nbsp;like&nbsp;how to cross the road, which will help younger children, and there are some more interesting facts, like the difference between a monolith and a megalith. Which even some adults might not know!&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Value for money</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>A surprisingly low price of &pound;9.99 is fantastic, as most books this size are priced at &pound;14.99</p>

<p><b>Overall opinion</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>An amazing book, which has made me look at the world in a different, and better, way. While aimed at children, this book has some good ideas for any LEGO City&nbsp;layout, even for adult builders. I look forward to seeing how the author develops Brickingdon&nbsp;in later books.</p>

<p>Interestingly&nbsp;the next book will be looking at shops, but will also include wheelchair access within design. So this could be an author to watch in the future.</p>
