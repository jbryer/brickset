"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-30T20:37:14Z","Nice little nab if you want it!","       This is a tiny set that I recieved for a little party gift. The green goblin is like the spider man equivalent of Vader. His little hover striker scooter thing is awesome. It has little harpoons on it and uses gears and aerodynamic wing pieces. Mary Jane is kindof cheap, not quit Kearston Dunst. It comes with a cool light thing that I added on to my towns streets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-11T02:11:31Z","Decent little set","Totally agree that this set is the Spidey equivalent of Final Duel, the cheap way to get the bad guy. This set, like so many of the Spider-man lineup is sparse for it's price, which at retail was about $8 (thank goodness for clearance). If only they made a two-fig set with Spidey in it.

Mary Jane is a figged with the same two-sided head with a scared face in the back included in the weirwolf studio pack. The evening gown is printed elegantly and loyally follows Kirsten Dunst's wardrobe from the movie.

The goblin's figged well, but the solid green helmet is obviously calling out for the painted redesign in the Origins set. The rocket sled is a decent representation of the movie craft, simple and sweet. Oh, and the translucent pumpkin bombs are a nice touch. 

9/10 'cause I really like the helmet and the dress piece, and if you can find this set now, it's probably at a merciful clearance price. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2008-01-11T11:06:03.497Z","fashionable mj","as a set this is no highlight, the glider is just too big, and the 2 huge printed slopes are as useless as one can think of. also that lamppost-thing does not convince.
on the other hand you get those two really fine minifigs, mj with a unique torso that makes her look gorgeous, and the goblin with a gold-imprinted helmet (not in 4852!).",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

How is this supposed to help in the Studios... it's not too useful.  This should really have been released as a Spiderman set instead of Studios.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-03T03:21:24.043Z","Get set for the figures if nothing else","Two cruitial people from the Spider Man movies, you need this set if you are into Spiderman Lego sets. The glider falls apart easily when playing with it my 6 year old has proven that time and time again. Overall a good set was 5 USD, and two awemome minifigures for the collection. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-01-23T08:29:29.077Z","Spidey Rarities","This was my first and smallest Spider-Man set. Shame you don't get Spidey AKA Peter Parker in it but you do get the two other main characters from the first movie, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst)and Norman Osborn who becomes the Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe). 

The main part of this set is the Green Goblin's glider. Consisting of 28 pieces the glider is quite large with a good wingspan and a rod with a handle for manoeuvring it in play or making movies. The rod can also be detached and used with the characters to make them fly and fall. The wings are on the new style block hinges to adjust the angle. The glider has painted blocks which is great, making it exclusive to this set and not having any lame stickers. It is armed with a laser at the front and spears on either end of the wings.

The Green goblin is also exclusive to this set, so it is a must if you want him. He is dressed the in full Green Goblin suit with a piece that goes on like a cape but allows you to clip him to things or attach him to the movie rod. His head is all green except for his face which is yellow, with eyes, mouth and eyebrows. His helmet is completely green, unlike the helmet in 4851, which has the Goblin but he has a helmet with yellow slit eyes.

MJ is also an exclusive to this set wearing what is meant to be the beautiful red dress  with goal seam and design from the movie. The head has two faces one smiling and the other scared, topped with orange hair tied up in a pony tail.

The other accessories that come with this set are: 
2x small street lamps
2x small fires
3x neon orange goblin bombs

Overall this is a great set to get to get for the price just due to the special mini-figs and rare parts. This set is good but it's playability is limited without another model containing Spidey. The aesthetics of this model are very good and pretty accurate to the movie considering it is LEGO. I feel this set is a 7/10, mainly due to the cool things you get in such a small model but the lack of playability doesn't give you much to do with it. Still this is a great set and a must for any Spider-Man fan. Also a good one for action fans or just for a change of pace in your collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-20T17:31:33.327Z","Ok, but needs more things on building","This is a small set of the studios theme, spider man subtheme. The set features no much innovations, and it still good in some things on the design (like some details of the minifigures and details of the goblin's jet). The set includes the minifigure of Mary Jane, that is simple but well designed, and have a good color scheme, with the correct schemes on the movie. The minifigure of green goblin is also well detailed, like in the &quot;armors&quot; on the torso and in the legs, all still in a Lego minifigure original shape, except by the head. The head (the piece is only the helmet), looks like to be an adaptation of the original, in Lego style, but the shape isn't good, and too the size. The color is nice, but it hidden the details on it, and it makes the minifigure  worst, because the body and head don't stay well together, with these odd differences on the shape. The jet isn't well made, too due to the size, but the minifigure fit well on it and the few details on the &quot;wings&quot; (these are made by some encurved long bricks), that are good printed details. But there are also more problems, like the missiles on each side of the wings, there are small missiles, and these fit well, but the size isn't the better. The set is also &quot;increased&quot; (not exactly, the small towers don't cahnges the building very much), with some small towers, made by circular bricks in different sizes, and these have a nice color scheme, combining beige and black, with some green details. Overall the idea wasn't bad, but some problems on the building and pieces used, with different shapes, makes this small set,that was a cheap option (but due to the price, it could includes more pieces, or the spiderman minifigure), not the best option to get some Lego spider man stuff.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-10-01T11:27:26.247Z","Save me, Spidey!","I remember looking at this set on display in Toysrus a few years back and inspecting every single detail on it. I think that this set is a bit weird. The street lamps are more like garden lamps because they are very short and I cannot imagine MJ hanging on to a garden lamp. Second, Green Goblin looks correct in every way for his Lego form but he looks very scary. The details on the glider's wings are printed. MJ brings a nice touch to this set.

The spiderman set is rare because of the glider and the pieces.
I used to love this set before I lost the minifigs.

"Marcus_Clinton","2009-05-14T18:24:00.483Z","Good Set","kinda basic but I think that was the point :P It was a great way to get mary jane and the green goblin. As a kid I loved maryjane and I kept on losing her so I bought like three! The little stand up lights are ok but a little random and the fire is a bit strange. It seems like lego just through those in. The green goblin's flyer is really cool and has great swooshability. The figs are really great for such a small set and maryjane has a double head Yay!

 The green goblin comes with a green mask which comes with green eyes instead of yellow eyes just like in the movie. He has some very cool markings on his armor which looks very detailed and he also has a backpack piece where you can put in the LEGO Studios staff. The green goblin comes with 3 transparent orange bombs just like in the movie. The bombs are as big as a head of a minifig but there're no markings on the bombs which we've seen in the movie which is a little bit disappointing. The green goblin has some nice markings on the back of his face and he has brown eyebrows.<br><br><span style=""font-style: italic;""><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Mary Jane Watson:</span><span style=""font-style: italic;""> </span></span>MJ comes with orange hair and the ruby colored dress which she wore when she got attacked by the green goblin in the movie.

"Odeinoichus","2010-12-22T11:39:37.613Z","EEEEEEK! Spider-Man Save Mary-Jane!","<p>Set #1374 Green Goblin: LEGO and Marvel teamed up for Spider-Man, but then Spider-Man was introduced to us in Studios... An odd choice, but it makes sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Green Goblin Mini-Figure is the real reason to be picking up this set, that plus the unique pieces that compose the Goblin Glider. Who cares if it says Studios on the box, it's Spider-Man's arch enemy and major love interest in one convenient package, definitely worth picking up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Goblin Glider is the bulk of the model, it uses most of the pieces included with the set and gives you a great looking vehicle that could fit in anywhere. It is a bit bigger than one might expect compared to the Mini-Figure, but it is still fun looking and fun to play with. The transparent 'pumpkin bombs' pieces are great accessories for the Green Goblin as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mary-Jane has a double-sided head with one carefree expression and one terrified expression. Her Mini-Figure also comes with a great looking torso design. It matches the fancy dress she wore in the movie quite nicely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The final aspect of this set is the ability to build a few light fixtures and flaming pieces (most likely to simulate explosions on a movie set.) not much, but still fun little additional pieces to use with the model. I really regret letting this and the other Spider-Man set go from my collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd recommend this set to everybody, the Green Goblin is a great new Mini-Figure and his mask is very well done. Mary-Jane isn't bad either and she has a unique colored hair piece that is a lighter shade of red compared to other red hair pieces. And the Goblin Glider makes for a polished looking LEGO super villain vehicle, teaming up the Goblin with any of Batman's rogues gallery (should you also own LEGO Batman sets) is also a fun passtime.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
