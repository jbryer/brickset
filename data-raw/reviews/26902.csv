<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>- Two figures in one polybag!</p>

<p>- New colors for the cape and cowl. The gold is in the Batcave set also, but it is good to get it again. The red and green combination works well for the clown, but I wonder if they would ever use it for any other Batman variants.</p>

<p>- Roller Disco has fun printing. The purple, gold and white color scheme works really well together. The purple belt is re-used for Catwoman also if you miss out on this set.</p>

<p>- Tears of Batman is interesting. It is a fun print and the colors work well for a clown.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>- The Tears of Batman doesn&#39;t have a Bat insignia anywhere. It is just a recoloring of the CMF Clown, which is unfortunate. His bowtie should be a comically oversized Bat symbol.</p>

<p>- The chest hair on Disco Batman is questionable. His lobster-lovin&#39; variant from the CMF also shows a chest, but no chest hair. Odd that there isn&#39;t more consistency. Although, the chest hair is very important for the Disco look.</p>

<p><strong>OVERALL OPINION:</strong></p>

<p>With the availability (or lack thereof) of some of these Gifts with Purchase, sometimes the aftermarket prices can be exorbitant. Ask yourself, do you really need this for your collection? There are rarer batsuit variants than this, so it will be a struggle for everyone. From my perspective, I waited to purchase something until this was available. Had I missed out completely, I would likely never own it. The figures are fun, but they are far from my favorite batsuit variants.</p>

<p>This set may not appeal to some people but it certainly appealed to me. You see, I collect Batman minifigures. I&rsquo;ve got 17 at the time of this review. And, no, they&rsquo;re not all the same. In fact, none of them are the same. Just collecting normal Batmans can get kinda dull though, so I was pretty happy to see all the weird and ridiculous ones from The Lego Batman Movie. I missed getting this set as a freebie, but luckily I was able to trade for it (It was a good trade too. A few old unwanted Star Wars minifigures for a nearly brand new poly). Now, on to the review!</p>

<p>THE MINIFIGURES</p>

<p>I thought I&rsquo;d do away with the other categories since there is no completed model, no instructions and the packaging isn&rsquo;t that interesting. If you really want to see it, then here you go. Anyway, this polybag includes not one but two goofy variations of Batman. Two minifigures in one poly is not a common sight. Let&rsquo;s look at the first minifigure: Disco Batman.</p>

<p>If you look hard enough, you can spot this suit in Batman&rsquo;s costume area, so it&rsquo;s nice to be able to get it in real life. Disco Batman will most likely be the more popular of the two minifigures since he has the gold cowl, the roller-skates, the add-on belt and the dual sided black/shiny gold cape.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/6v9xa3syb/Disco_Batman_01.jpg"" style=""width: 650px; height: 487px;"" /></p>

<p>The cowl is pearl gold, molded that color instead of printing. While it doesn&rsquo;t exactly match the cape, I prefer this color gold as the printed gold tends to scratch rather easily. Disco Batman&rsquo;s head is nothing new. His torso, on the other hand, is a brand new print that looks very snazzy. It&rsquo;s modeled of the CMF Disco Dude (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8684-13/Disco-Dude"">https://brickset.com/sets/8684-13/Disco-Dude</a>) so it has printing front and back.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/6jsgxccib/Disco_Batman-Back.jpg"" style=""width: 650px; height: 487px;"" /></p>

<p>The white and purple color scheme looks brilliant and the gold bat pendant adds a nice splash of extra color to match the cape, cowl and roller-skates. It also adds the perfect level of Batman to the outfit. The legs are plain white, but that&rsquo;s ok since he has the purple version of the utility belt. The gold roller-skates are a nice touch but they do make it hard to pose Batman outside of a studded surface. Now, we have the amazing shiny cape! it is not exclusive. since it appeared on the Batpack batsuit in the Batcave, but it is so cool! Black on one side, shiny gold on the other. Just be careful. I imagine that it would be easy to stain and/or scratch. Overall, I give this minifigure 10/10.&nbsp;The only thing that could have made him better is maybe a gold or purple batarang, but that&rsquo;s probably to much to ask.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Next we have the slightly less substantial Tears of Batman (or just clown Batman if you prefer).</p>

<p>According to Brickset&rsquo;s official review, it&rsquo;s based off something called Tears Of A Clown. I wasn&rsquo;t so sure I wanted this minifigure when I saw the pictures. I couldn&rsquo;t see the leg printing and the body just looked like a CMF clown body. It is based off this clown, but it&rsquo;s not exactly the same: <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8683-4/Circus-Clown"">https://brickset.com/sets/8683-4/Circus-Clown</a>. Now that I have the minifigure, I&rsquo;m glad that I got it. First and foremost, we get an exclusive red cow. which is a brand new color for Bat cowls. Next comes the green Batcape, another new exclusive piece. The torso is also exclusive, detailing suspenders, polka dots and a bow tie. The back of the torso is unprinted.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/q7w82mt77/Clown_Batman-Back.jpg"" style=""width: 650px; height: 487px;"" /></p>

<p>One arm is red and on is yellow. The legs are yellow and sand blue: yellow hips and left leg and sand blue right leg, both printed with patches. My only complaint is the lack of some type of Batsymbol, but I guess if this is an undercover suit, then no symbol is ok. Joker will never see him coming&hellip;if the cape and cowl wasn&rsquo;t a dead giveaway. Overall, Tears Of Batman is better than expected plus he&rsquo;s almost entirely exclusive (minus the head). He&rsquo;s also probably the most colorful Batman ever.</p>

<p>OVERALL</p>

<p>If you enjoyed The Lego Batman Movie or you are a Batman collector or both (like me) then I highly recommend this set&hellip;as long as you don&rsquo;t go broke trying to get it. Freebies such as this tend to command a fairly steep price on the secondary market, which is ironic since it was a freebie..</p>

<p>Quick Note: The capes are normal fabric not the spongy kind. Also, giving Clown Batman a few pips as juggling ball would look good.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2017-08-23T23:14:54.887Z","Batsuits Galore","<p><strong>Set #30607 Disco Batman/Tears of Batman:</strong> When they introduced The LEGO Batman Movie to the roster of feature films who could have expected they would go all out with all of these promotional polybags and alternative costumes, however they surprised us with this in February. One of many polybags and one featuring two fun alternative costumes for the Caped Crusader.</p>

<p>Disco Batman: This minifigure was featured prominently in the final scene of the movie during the credits. The costume is quite appealing, a plain white outfit with double-sided torso printing, a purple utility belt a pair of gold skates, a golden cowl and a dual-sided cape. He has a gold material on one side and a&nbsp;dark black&nbsp;material underneath. His facial printing features an open mouth scowl on one side with a white band for wide eyes, the alternative expression is a disgruntled looking print with narrow white eyes on a black band showing his dissatisfaction at having to sing and dance in this scene.</p>

<p>Tears of Batman: The clown suit, his greatest fear... Or perhaps not, but this outfit is very fun looking with a red cowl, a goofy pair of suspenders on a white polka dotted blue shirt with big goofy red buttons and a comical bow-tie. His arms are two different colors, one is red the other is yellow. His legs have minor printing showing patch marks from where the outfit was torn, he has a single yellow leg and a single light blue leg, an interesting look using the technique we&#39;ve seen before for this sort of leg configuration during the Fire &amp; Ice Sub-Theme of Legends of Chima. He has a green cape as well.</p>

<p>His head features a large grinning smile on one side and a grimacing angry looking expression on the other.</p>

<p>Overall both minifigures are very impressive, they lack any accessories however, aside from the new utility belt piece on Disco Batman, however for fans of the caped crusader I would strongly recommend tracking this one down if you missed it back in February.</p>
