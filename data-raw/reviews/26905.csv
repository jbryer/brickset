<p>The set features&nbsp;53 colourful pieces.&nbsp;Whilst this is of course a small polybag set, it does use a variety of interesting build techniques - SNOT, lots of hinges, and upside down bricks. The build instructions consists of 21 main steps, with step 9 broken down into 6 sub-steps.</p>

<h3><b>Finished Model</b></h3>

<p>To my untrained eye, this&nbsp;is immediately recognisable as a stereotypical Chameloen. It is suitably colourful and the unfortunate fly on the end of the long tongue is a lovely touch. The legs, mouth, tongue and tail are all movable using hinges. The legs perhaps aren&#39;t quite right, bending outwards rather than forward/back. But for the size of the set, using a ball joint would have been difficult, and ugly.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>This is another great Creator polybag animal, and perhaps one of the best, if not the best. This is exactly the kind of creation&nbsp;I want from small creator sets!</p>

"Arcanelexicon77","2017-06-03T01:51:49.04Z","Good build for the kids","<p>I was able to get 2 of these for free when I bought some sets and I let my kid build it. She kept saying it was an easy, fun, colorful build and she enjoyed putting it together. Now there&#39;s two lizards in my house that keeps popping up everywhere. On top of the TV, besides the Xbox, on door handles and everywhere she can leave them so she can surprise us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros: The figure is well designed. Legs can swing in and out which makes it easy to grab onto stuff. Tail also swings up and down to help balance the figure. Color is pretty nice as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons: The fly on its mouth can get lost if dropped. The brick piece can be replaced easily, but the wings part might be a little hard to find. Although the figure comes with an extra wing part, I had to secure it with glue to make sure it doesn&#39;t get lost. Even if you remove though, it still looks nice.&nbsp;</p>

"CarolinaOnMyMind","2018-01-14T06:19:14.6Z","Nearly Perfect for what it is","<p>Wow, I love this little thing! I bought it for my 4-year old daughter and I think I like it at least as much as she does, maybe more.&nbsp;I&#39;m not even sure I can explain exactly why, but I&#39;ll try.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obviously a very small Creator set and therefore there are not a great number of pieces (~50, I think) and the build is rather short &amp; straightforward (my daughter had little trouble putting it together herself).</p>

<p>But as small and simple as it is,&nbsp;the finished model is FANTASTIC! First of all, it looks like what it&#39;s supposed to. It&#39;s&nbsp;distinctly Lego, but immediately&nbsp;recognizable as a chameleon, and a cute and charismatic one at that.</p>

<p>Secondly, the colors are perfect. The predominantly&nbsp;pale/spring green body (obviously, I don&#39;t know the proper name of this color), with yellow underbelly and blue highlights just works so well on this. And the bright red tongue just tops it off.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thirdly, considering how small it is and how few pieces it uses, the model has&nbsp;great posability. It has two hinges in its tail allowing you to curl it either up or down, front &amp; back legs are both moveable, the head adjusts up and down and the mouth can open &amp; close at the same time. There&#39;s even a hinge on the extended tongue in case you want to change the angle at which it snags that fly!</p>

<p>Sure, it&#39;s rather odd&nbsp;that the legs only hinge outward and therefore can&#39;t move forward &amp; backwards. But as bad as this sounds, it actually isn&#39;t that big of a negative. As they are, it allows you to splay the legs&nbsp;and put the little guy in&nbsp;some rather interesting poses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The eyes are positioned on&nbsp;round, blue discs and give it a lot of character. And while you cannot move them significantly, just by rotating the round eye&nbsp;pieces, you can even make it appear as if it&#39;s looking in two different directions&mdash;which to me is perhaps THE essential quality of a chameleon. Brilliant!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Well, if you haven&#39;t figured it out already, I adore this thing! It&#39;s tiny, but that adds to its charm and&nbsp;also makes it really inexpensive. &nbsp;It has great playability for something so small and I also think it looks great &quot;on display&quot;&nbsp;around the house. I don&#39;t have a ton of them, but this&nbsp;was immediately one of my favorite polybags ever, and remains so to this day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is Lego done right, and it just makes me happy. Woo!</p>

"Snail","2018-10-03T16:12:06.323Z","Sweet and colourful cameleon","<p>With a nice, diverse but yet consistent color palette and a pretty final build, this little chameleon is a lot of fun for such a small set.</p>

<p>Parts are great for such a small set, the shapes add up nicely. The only thing i don&#39;t like a lot is the tongue, which looks a bit crude compared to the rest of the model.</p>

<p>Building it is intuitive, small kids are able to do it and get a fast reward.</p>

<p>Playing is a bit restricted as there are no wheels etc. which allow direct motion, and moving the legs is nothing a kid would do all the time. Yet, it&#39;s constantly &quot;walking the walls&quot; for days whenever it was built, so i assume kids don&#39;t think it&#39;s boring to play with.</p>

<p>Polybags are always a bit on the expensive side compared to larger sets, but as this overall experience is a good one, the price is not too bad.</p>
