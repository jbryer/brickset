<p>This set is an interesting&nbsp;incarnation of the undersized helicopter&nbsp;concept,&nbsp;it doesn&#39;t&nbsp;look minifigure&nbsp;scale because&nbsp;it&#39;s not supposed to be. The build is simple, but fun to put together. As far as parts go the 1x4 printed tile, the windshield&nbsp;and the camera are the best parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The one minifigure&nbsp;is pretty&nbsp;cool. Starting from the top, she has a standard white helmet with a trans black visor. The face print is new for 2017 and shows black sunglasses and a mouth with lipstick. The torso is also new for 2017 and shows a badge a walkie-talkie, and a radio&nbsp;on a brown belt. The color&nbsp;for the torso is dark blue, but the hands are dark bluish gray. The legs are just plain dark blue with no prints.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall I think it is a nice poly bag, but, not worth more than $5 so if you got it for free from the Lego store it is great. In the end, I hope this review was helpful and informative.</p>
