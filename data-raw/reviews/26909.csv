<p>As for the build, it is a pretty dull build for a rather useless training piece. It is cool that you can spin the training dummy as the ninjas train, but it&#39;s just not a very cool build.</p>

<p>I wanted this set primarily for the minifigures, and would mainly recommend this set for them as well. If your looking for a nice polybag with good play value, I would recommend maybe getting a different set first.</p>
