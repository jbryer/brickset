"Lee_Fogel","2017-05-18T14:45:44.867Z","Well worth the small cost!","<p>I had suggested this little set to my son when I saw it hanging on an end cap in Toys R Us. I thought he might like it to go with his Superman minifigure from set 76044 Clash of the Heroes. And it is appealing once you start looking at all of the small pieces and different colors. Alas, he passed. It stuck in my mind though that it could be a fun set and, if anything, a great choice for some unique spare parts (<em>and a cute doggie!</em>). So I decided to pick it up for myself and build it and then see what my son thinks after seeing it done.</p>

<p>The set is a simple little polybag that goes together within ten minutes or so. Instructions are clear and are one small sheet printed on both sides. The colors in this set are really nice and varied between the clear and solid parts. Krypto&#39;s&nbsp;flyer builds easily and if you choose you could change the layout of the two yellow pieces from paired vertically to horizontally and allow for a minifigure to pilot it instead of Krypto. While we are talking about the flyer please note that while the packaging shows the nose piece and tail to have stickers the parts actually have the designs tampo&nbsp;stamped on them. This makes for a cleaner looking flyer in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The green Kryptomite&nbsp;took the most time to build and that&#39;s due to making sure the little green clear parts were in the right direction. Its little purple flyer/glider is about 1/2 the parts count of Krypto&#39;s flyer. With this flyer, you could replace the single black base that has a single stud with one that allows for a minifigure to fly it if you so choose. I thought it would make a great little flyer/glider for Killer Moth or perhaps the Green Goblin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The extras parts are terrific for the parts bins with eleven pieces (<em>eight of the clear variety</em>) left over including an extra green Kryptomite&nbsp;face.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall for $3.99 you <strong>really</strong> cannot go wrong. Whether you use it for spare parts or build it up it is a smart buy and terrific value. The playability options are solid especially if you change around the base pieces to allow minifigures to be pilots of the flyers. Oh, and my son&#39;s take on it? Once he saw it built he thought it was lots of fun to play with and loved the all of the extra parts!</p>

"The_Crea1or","2017-06-07T01:15:19.07Z","Krypto!","<p>I purchased this from TRU a while back as I had been wanting a Krypto&nbsp;figure for a while. &nbsp;The set overall is nice with a Kryptomite&nbsp;and a jetpack&nbsp;fighting against Krypto. &nbsp;Kids will enjoy the inclusion of two stud shooters in such a small set. &nbsp;My only complaint is that why on earth does Krypto need a mini jet? He has all the same powers of Superman (he can fly!) so I see no need for it to be included. &nbsp;The designers probably just wanted the piece count to be a little higher.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
