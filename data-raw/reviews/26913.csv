A nice build, not that hard. In the end you will hold two boxes, which will hold all the pieces and checkers. Four lids that when everything is combined will become the chessboard.</p>

<p><strong>Improvement:</strong><br />
I found that the bottom of the boxes were a bit off, since the rest of the boxes and lids are smooth and the bottom are exposing all the studs. I figured, why not add&nbsp;a couple (196 to be exact) <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3068#T=S&amp;C=9&amp;O={&quot;color&quot;:9}"">tiles (2 x 2)</a>? So I got back in Lego land, and purchased the tiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br />
For me adding the tiles completed the set. I expected that Lego would have came to the same conclusion when creating the set. I wonder why this small improvement, with big impact was not already part of the set.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
A nice set that is not part of any theme, quite rewarding. It really brings the world of nice chess pieces and Lego&nbsp;together.</p>

<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>

<p>Lots of playability.</p>

<p>Easy storage and transport.</p>

<p>Doubles as checkers.</p>

<p>Good color scheme.</p>

<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>

<p>Some of the chess pieces&nbsp;don&#39;t stick well to the board.</p>

<p>The chess pieces are very cramped on&nbsp;the board.</p>

<p>Since I&nbsp;am Canadian, the set is worth less than $70.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this is a good set for any chess players.</p>
