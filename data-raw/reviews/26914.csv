<p>Every year Lego&nbsp;has exclusive&nbsp;seasonal sets for Easter&nbsp;Christmas&nbsp;etc. and this is the one for Easter 2017 and I think that Lego did a good job on this one it follows the 2017 seasonal format ware the build is split into 3 pieces plus accessories&nbsp;on the side.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The three section are built alike they all have a fence in the back and all have a place to hide an egg. There are a lot of nice details&nbsp;like a mailbox, carrot planter, flowers and a chicken coop. The accessories&nbsp;are a green wheelbarrow, a magnifying&nbsp;glass, a chicken, a basket for the eggs and the eggs themselves.</p>

<h3>The Minifigures</h3>

<p>The figures are simple, but, are acceptable and would be good in a city setup. The woman has black hair a green torso and blue legs. The boy has dark orange hair a dark blue torso and dark tan short legs.</p>

<h3>The Parts</h3>

<p>There are some nice parts in this set like the eggs in blue, gray and white, plus the accessories and chicken.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In the end I think this a great set and I everything a good seasonal set should be, for $9.99 USD I think it is a good deal too.&nbsp;I hope this review&nbsp;was helpful to you thanks for reading.</p>

The biggest positive alone easily to mention is the very cheap inclusion of more egg pieces first introduced with Angry Birds Movie sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

It&rsquo;s a very nice looking box design and shows off the set very nicely. Overall great functional box.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Instructions: The instructions are typical for Seasonal sets, they show the build of each small piece in sections, and include a parts checklist in the back. The back cover also shows off our next Vignette style set, a Halloween themed piece. I&rsquo;m kind of surprised there&rsquo;s no summer based set honestly, it is seasonal, though not exactly holiday&hellip; however I digress.</span></span></span></span></p>

Some great parts for MOC fans or just clever builders in general.</span></span></span></span></p>

She&rsquo;s got a nice pair of light-blue legs and a dolphin patterned top in lime-green. She gets an orange basket for an accessory.</span></span></span></span></p>

Every section of build can be finished in a little under ten minutes with rapid-fire building techniques that impress and create some nice scenery. Nothing stands out as difficult or tricky, squeezing single studs together to make rows of flower can be a tad repetitive though.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The first small area represents a garden path leading up to a front gateway with a mailbox on one side, the mailbox is a fairly standard design, we&rsquo;ve seen this particular micro-model in numerous sets in other Themes before. The garden path is a nice touch, with four flowers on each side of the main path, two each of colours orange, light purple, dark purple and teal. Hiding inside the mailbox is the grey egg, just pop it open and there you&rsquo;ll find it.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The other portions of the model represent backyard locations, the first is a little chicken coup with a fence behind it matching the gate. There&rsquo;s a small nest where the hen has laid a regular sized egg using the small spherical cane topper piece used to tip Saruman&rsquo;s wizard&rsquo;s staff in LotR and The Hobbit sets. A white flag piece is used as a door for the chicken and inside is the large white egg to be found by the young boy.</span></span></span></span></p>

The carrot garden rests on a hinged plate, open it to reveal the blue egg, the rarest of prizes.</span></span></span></span></p>

There&rsquo;s a lot to like about this set, and only a limited amount to be disappointed with, I would have liked to have seen a larger baseplate with more detailing for a fenced in yard setting, but what we&rsquo;ve got makes for a good first attempt and should be easy to MOC a full yard with enough parts. The fence design is really impressive and I find myself wanting more of that part to make a fully enclosed fence.</span></span></span></span></p>
