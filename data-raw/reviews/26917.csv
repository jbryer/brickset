"LegoBatmanLandon","2018-02-24T03:21:36.277Z","great value for an exclusive minifigure.","<p>this poly bag&nbsp;is the first battle pod ever made. it includes an exclusive tiger tuxedo Batman that is the main part of the set. as of the time I am writing this, the average price for this poly bag&nbsp;on eBay&nbsp;and bricklink&nbsp;is around $10-15, but I bought this of amazon for $10.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros: Exclusive Batman minifigure,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons: aside from the minifigure, the rest of the pieces are pretty bland except for the printed 2x2 computer tile that is still common in junior sets, the battle pod has no unique features to mess around with</p>
