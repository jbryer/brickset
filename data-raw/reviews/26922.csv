<h3><strong>Build</strong></h3>

<p>The bat signal can rotate a full 360 degrees from the base, the top can move up and down smoothly. The colors&nbsp;are mainly dark bluish&nbsp;gray and light bluish gray with a little bit of black. The main signal part has a large dome piece in trans black, inside of it there is a bat logo printed tile.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigure</strong></h3>

<p>The one figure is just your average Batman&nbsp;with a yellow&nbsp;belt&nbsp;a black batarang&nbsp;and a soft cape, still cool though.</p>

<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>

<p>This is a very cool polybag&nbsp;but, I don&#39;t think it is worth spending a lot of money on because&nbsp;it has common parts and a common minifigure. In the end, I hope this review was helpful and informative.</p>

It&#39;s not for free, but it&#39;s the only time I&#39;ve ever seen one of these things physically.</p>

<p>The set comes with a Batman Minifig, a Bat Signal, sticker sheet and poster.</p>

<p>The Batman minifig is standard affair, no unique parts but it&#39;s nice to be able to get a Batman Movie version this cheap, with a Batarang and included small build.</p>

<p>The small build being a Bat Signal, which is an excellent extra for a polybag. It&#39;s a nice looking build with a lot of useful pieces, The Bat Logo print on a round 2x2 especially. It&#39;s also an interesting choice as another Bat Signal (albeit a much simpler one) is included in the GCPD accsessory pack, but this one is overall much nicer designed. (There&#39;s also a third one included in the Ultimate Bat Signal... Incase you REALLY want Batman&#39;s attention.) A base is even included to easily attach to a roof of a building.</p>

<p>There&#39;s also a poster and sticker sheet. They&#39;re alright, kids will like them. I only wish the logos were the same size as a round 2x2 essentially getting 3 other logos.</p>

<p>Great value overall, it&#39;s like a CMF but for an extra pound you get a nice build. And other things.</p>
