<p>Hello everybody,</p>

<p>Today I am going to review a exclusive LEGO Creator set 40252 VW Beetle.I bought it few days ago in my local LEGO Store.So let us start. :)</p>

<p><strong>Box and instructions</strong></p>

<p>So you get that LEGO Promotional box like 40220 London Bus.It is nice small box.When you open it you get some bags (it camed&nbsp;like that to me some contain only one bag) sticker sheet and instruction booklet.So let us start building it.</p>

<p><strong>Pieces</strong></p>

<p>In this set you get 91 pcs.There are not any special pcs, but I am glad that they used this kind of wheels.Good job LEGO. :)</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The build is easy and quick.So let us move to the review.</p>

<p><b>The final product</b></p>

<p>I really like it.It has a liitle diffrent shape then that 1000+ pcs set, but it is solid.You get a lot of stickers that is what I do not like.It is the same problem like on the London Bus. :( &nbsp;Then I love these wheels.They included and this nice surboard.There are no minifigures in this set, but it is in&nbsp;a minifigure&nbsp;scale ( kind off).</p>

<p><strong>Veridict</strong></p>

<p>I love this set, the only thing that is bodering me is a lot and I mean A LOT of stickers, please LEGO these are exclusive sets, so then made them with prints.I like the shape and everything so I do not have anything else to say about this set.</p>

<p>That is all for this review.Next review will be: LEGO Creator Blue Express Train.</p>

<p>Your SlovenianBrick101 :)</p>
