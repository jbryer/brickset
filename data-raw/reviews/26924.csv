The packaging is all based around The Batman LEGO&nbsp;movie and I don&#39;t see this outfit&nbsp;working in any set in the future. It comes with the white LEGO tile and looks great. Nice tampo&nbsp;images and is typical LEGO quality.</p>

<p>If your budget allows for it I&#39;d see about locating one on Ebay but you may have to pay some serious $$$ to get one as it&#39;s limited to Cinemark Theater 3D ticket buyers only.</p>

"J14T14","2018-02-02T13:52:43.203Z","Kiss Kiss Tuxedo Batman","<p>This is my first keychain from the LEGO&reg; group. It was given away with qualifying purchases in early 2017, but I picked one up at my Target for $5.99 in early 2018. Their stock of this set&nbsp;was&nbsp;overflowing.</p>

<p>Anyway, the legs, head, and mask are all stuck onto this figure and the keychain part of it is not removable, but the arms legs, and hands still move like a normal minifigures. The printed tile has the LEGO logo and copyright&nbsp;information on it. You can stick the tile on normal LEGO system studs as well as the feet of the minifigure. The hands can also hold accessories if you wish.</p>

<p>The printing on the minifigure is amazing and makes me wish that this was a collectable minifigure instead of a keychain. The lipstick kisses continue onto the front of the torso and legs, around on the arms and side of the legs, and on the back of the torso. The expression on the face looks the same as other Batman minifigures&nbsp;we have gotten in the past, though I may be mistaken on that.</p>

<p>Overall, I think that this is a great little keychain and is worth the $6.00 I payed for it at my Target store..</p>

"Minifig290","2018-02-13T18:57:57.34Z","Alright Polybag, Shame It Was A Keychain","<p>This set was released in 2017 across multiple different stores in multiple country. In the UK it was released&nbsp;at Argos for &pound;5, US it was available at Target for $6.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The figure is a key chain and not&nbsp;a figure which is rather disappointing as the parts would be extremely useful for many people as a tuxedo with kisses all over it is unique and unseen before in LEGO. If the keychain is an issue it can be removed with the right tools but i wouldn&#39;t risk it</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>I&nbsp;finish this review with a question which will probably never be answered, that is why is it a keychain and not a minifigure as it would be more popular if it was a figure and not a keychain which really makes this polybag a disappointment.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-</strong> Looks good and was a common polybag</p>

<p><strong>Cons- </strong>It isn&#39;t a figure but a keychain and can&#39;t be disassembled</p>

<p>This keychain includes one Kiss kiss tuxedo Batman and a tile.</p>

<p>This key chain is just like any other and can not be taken apart.</p>

<p>He has kiss marks all over even on his arms and the sides of legs. My favorite part of this set is the Lego logo tile that is attached to the main keyring.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall i think this set is kinda cool and yet strange at the same time. I would say that if you like key chains just like me, you should pick this one up.</p>
