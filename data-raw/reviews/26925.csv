<p>This is the front and back for the polybag. You can see R2 is standing on the sand scene, maybe going different direction from C3PO after a little fight. At the back of the pack, you can peek through the translucent part and see the head of R2 hiding inside.</p>

<p>Faster open the polybag and bring out my beloved R2-D2!<br />
*C3PO and Jawa are not included in this set. They will be in pictures below for illustration purpose.</p>

<p><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z984f9i1HmU/WTJAUmvn1nI/AAAAAAAAANc/f5koGXbs4xotaYEOVUni8U5CNoT6zZX7ACLcB/s1600/3.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1067"" data-original-width=""1600"" height=""426"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z984f9i1HmU/WTJAUmvn1nI/AAAAAAAAANc/f5koGXbs4xotaYEOVUni8U5CNoT6zZX7ACLcB/s640/3.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></p>

<p>The plastic bag material is quite fragile, so you need to be very gentle or else the whole thing will be thorn apart and you&#39;ll need to pick up the pieces scattered on the floor. The first thing I took out was the big head of R2.</p>

<p><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OWmgEMLy4QI/WTJBdqvGq0I/AAAAAAAAAOI/M8mS3f_XwuwSmETAUtS8ZkeeYW1PdRUggCLcB/s1600/5.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1067"" data-original-width=""1600"" height=""426"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-OWmgEMLy4QI/WTJBdqvGq0I/AAAAAAAAAOI/M8mS3f_XwuwSmETAUtS8ZkeeYW1PdRUggCLcB/s640/5.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></p>

<p>Inside you&#39;ll get a small bag of smaller parts, an instruction booklet, and other parts listed in the picture below.<br />
*C3PO and Jawa and small R2D2 are not included in this set. They will be in pictures below for illustration purpose.</p>

<p><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_SEtqWFql_U/WTJBeCowLkI/AAAAAAAAAOM/PElGUXpusNwI-lzUXpfnL1EHJsBilkxZgCEw/s1600/6.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1600"" data-original-width=""1159"" height=""640"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-_SEtqWFql_U/WTJBeCowLkI/AAAAAAAAAOM/PElGUXpusNwI-lzUXpfnL1EHJsBilkxZgCEw/s640/6.jpg"" width=""462"" /></a></p>

<p>These are the parts included in the set. Quite a few technic pins and parts for articulation and curved top bricks for the body of R2-D2.</p>

<p><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5Zg8lxz4Ylk/WTJBeVxK7PI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/gwm10Kx-qqASVr3ePlmaC99ZIO3O_me8QCEw/s1600/8.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1067"" data-original-width=""1600"" height=""426"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5Zg8lxz4Ylk/WTJBeVxK7PI/AAAAAAAAAOQ/gwm10Kx-qqASVr3ePlmaC99ZIO3O_me8QCEw/s640/8.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></p>

<p>Wake up R2, the Jawas are going to sell us or melt us! I prefer selling, at least we got a new master.</p>

<p><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oKiZpUwJdDk/WTJBfyTeM9I/AAAAAAAAAOU/Mmyq8fnX44YwIwLStval1d8lxlzbH8PNACEw/s1600/9.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1067"" data-original-width=""1600"" height=""426"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-oKiZpUwJdDk/WTJBfyTeM9I/AAAAAAAAAOU/Mmyq8fnX44YwIwLStval1d8lxlzbH8PNACEw/s640/9.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></p>

<p><br />
Lets start building. The first step will have something like a post box as the main frame of the body.</p>

<p><a href=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HzIS1D-jxhg/WTJBPFe8dOI/AAAAAAAAANo/Q_YGGPwuewkgLKGiel9LT33_wFK8MhnsQCEw/s1600/10.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1067"" data-original-width=""1600"" height=""426"" src=""https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-HzIS1D-jxhg/WTJBPFe8dOI/AAAAAAAAANo/Q_YGGPwuewkgLKGiel9LT33_wFK8MhnsQCEw/s640/10.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></p>

<p>Then you will build the outer curve of the body fixed to the post box.</p>

<p><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ia6VVrQt1so/WTJBOADgF5I/AAAAAAAAANg/iQVJLd3QeYYwaVwDVUZ09C9KCcMH-4PEACEw/s1600/11.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1067"" data-original-width=""1600"" height=""426"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ia6VVrQt1so/WTJBOADgF5I/AAAAAAAAANg/iQVJLd3QeYYwaVwDVUZ09C9KCcMH-4PEACEw/s640/11.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></p>

<p>Oh now you get a photocopy machine as the body. The jumpers are for the vents to be attached later on. C3PO is holding the bottom part of R2 that will hold its center leg.</p>

<p><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Xi0V0cQkvT0/WTJBOy7LYRI/AAAAAAAAANk/TDoWfG4iepgGf_ClfvPEHsdTFVeM-_ciwCEw/s1600/12.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1067"" data-original-width=""1600"" height=""426"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Xi0V0cQkvT0/WTJBOy7LYRI/AAAAAAAAANk/TDoWfG4iepgGf_ClfvPEHsdTFVeM-_ciwCEw/s640/12.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></p>

<p><br />
Now you&#39;ll build both R2&#39;s right and left legs and attached to the body via the technic pin. See how C3PO is so impatient that he asked me to faster put R2D2 together.</p>

<p><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3ZNePpR6970/WTJBRC5XEMI/AAAAAAAAANs/aTlVcRbIY-MdRSmeImDuiY4_BM8YFbEFwCEw/s1600/13.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1067"" data-original-width=""1600"" height=""426"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3ZNePpR6970/WTJBRC5XEMI/AAAAAAAAANs/aTlVcRbIY-MdRSmeImDuiY4_BM8YFbEFwCEw/s640/13.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></p>

<p>These two are the printed parts in this set and I really love the dome shaped head! So nicely printed and it has a slight metallic feel of the silver colour.</p>

<p><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qy17SDk02Ic/WTJBTDp3qDI/AAAAAAAAANw/Hr54XMCpCAIquulzc38I4yUsufzW7PrrgCEw/s1600/15.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1067"" data-original-width=""1600"" height=""426"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Qy17SDk02Ic/WTJBTDp3qDI/AAAAAAAAANw/Hr54XMCpCAIquulzc38I4yUsufzW7PrrgCEw/s640/15.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></p>

<p>Here is the comparison between the brick built R2 head and the minifigure R2 head. The difference is that there is a stud on top of the smaller R2 and all other printings are quite the same.</p>

<p><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--VBODnav4k0/WTJBT6cvWzI/AAAAAAAAAN0/STT1-8shC_YVT6WbWi2KmFG4AesTepIzgCEw/s1600/16.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1067"" data-original-width=""1600"" height=""426"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--VBODnav4k0/WTJBT6cvWzI/AAAAAAAAAN0/STT1-8shC_YVT6WbWi2KmFG4AesTepIzgCEw/s640/16.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></p>

<p>Tadaaa! Now we are completed the build of R2D2! The Jawas are taking them in their sandcrawler to seek for new buyers.</p>

<p><a href=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YspuW0cSR2c/WTJBUkHwDLI/AAAAAAAAAN4/2-R_UwYHefIrnNAt4a1z3Q6U82QZvp8dgCEw/s1600/18.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1067"" data-original-width=""1600"" height=""426"" src=""https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-YspuW0cSR2c/WTJBUkHwDLI/AAAAAAAAAN4/2-R_UwYHefIrnNAt4a1z3Q6U82QZvp8dgCEw/s640/18.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></p>

<p>These are the extra parts for this set. Just in case you lose one of these.</p>

<p><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zWAWMsnhd2M/WTJBYltMpbI/AAAAAAAAAOA/r3dJsJGP4-wKur02UnGuAds83FTyDV_pwCEw/s1600/19.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1067"" data-original-width=""1600"" height=""426"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-zWAWMsnhd2M/WTJBYltMpbI/AAAAAAAAAOA/r3dJsJGP4-wKur02UnGuAds83FTyDV_pwCEw/s640/19.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></p>

<p>As you can see in the picture, the brick built R2 will lean forward at a gradient as the center leg is longer than both right and left. Unlike the minifigures, this R2 cannot stand straight unless you remove the center part of the leg and the clip. However, I liked the fact that its head can be rotated 360 degrees, just like in the movies!<br />
*Light blue R2D2(10225) and dark blue R2D2(75136) are not included in this set. They will be in pictures below for illustration purpose.</p>

<p><a href=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cqzHO_r4N8U/WTJzOtWfGBI/AAAAAAAAAOk/o5-eF-cdvOYuQGfA6esaTAnlpiTjuGkKQCEw/s1600/22.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1067"" data-original-width=""1600"" height=""426"" src=""https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cqzHO_r4N8U/WTJzOtWfGBI/AAAAAAAAAOk/o5-eF-cdvOYuQGfA6esaTAnlpiTjuGkKQCEw/s640/22.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></p>

<p>Now I&#39;ve removed the center leg and you can pose it like others with any degree of inclination you want. I like it so much that he is so flexible!</p>

<p><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3HlmEI64NIY/WTJBYS5HYEI/AAAAAAAAAN8/G3DOzrDb3B4pEYkq1ZDkHZsaDNGcVgdVACEw/s1600/20.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1067"" data-original-width=""1600"" height=""426"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3HlmEI64NIY/WTJBYS5HYEI/AAAAAAAAAN8/G3DOzrDb3B4pEYkq1ZDkHZsaDNGcVgdVACEw/s640/20.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></p>

<p><br />
Oh no! The Jawas are catching us! Run faster R2!</p>

<p><a href=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WeqcAt22LF0/WTJBZTykBRI/AAAAAAAAAOE/Ig91x-yStPMKivrf59dHD2lD3ZyDFC-dgCEw/s1600/21.jpg"" imageanchor=""1""><img border=""0"" data-original-height=""1067"" data-original-width=""1600"" height=""426"" src=""https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-WeqcAt22LF0/WTJBZTykBRI/AAAAAAAAAOE/Ig91x-yStPMKivrf59dHD2lD3ZyDFC-dgCEw/s640/21.jpg"" width=""640"" /></a></p>

<p>Haha, now who&#39;s laughing?<br />
<br />
<b>Conclusion</b><br />
This polybag is very nice to be collected if you are a Star Wars fan. The built is very accurate instead of bulky feel. It has a very sleek design and very detailed in this size. Now I hope there is a brick built C3PO to be his partner. Thanks for reading!</p>

"Kabba","2018-04-26T14:20:32.757Z","(KAB) Unique twist on a classic","<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>This poly-bag&nbsp;offers a surprising amount of unique or rare parts, the set contains no stickers, so all detailed pieces are printed. Some of the most notable are R2 D2&#39;s dome, only seen in 10215, which&nbsp;is a hard to get UCS set.</p>

<p><strong>Building</strong></p>

<p>The building of this set was fairly quick, but did feel rather repetitious when building the legs considering the scale of the build, but none the less is still only a poly-bag.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>The set is not that playable due too its unique scale compared to other lego figures, and it also lacks wheels, making it difficult to &#39;move&#39; around. It is also somewhat fragile if held for too long.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>The value of this set for how much it costs feels tremendous compared to other poly-bags that have been released, considering the amount of unique parts it contains, and for how the build looks on the outside, I would certainly recommend it.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>The build itself is Amazing, lego&nbsp;has released many R2 D2 variants (scale wise), but this one not only stands out in size, but also detail. This is by far one of lego&#39;s better poly-bags for starwars, and I hope they do plan on making other droids on this scale (Gonk Droid, C3 P0, Mouse droid, etc)</p>
