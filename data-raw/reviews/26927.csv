"Ultimate_Bricks","2017-05-01T03:24:11.327Z","A small build and great minifigure","<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The stealthy&nbsp;swamp airboat is a small vehicle that is powered by a big fan on the back and two jet engines one on each side. The front has two lights and two stud shooters with brown triggers. There are also 2 swords&nbsp;one on each side, they can be removed to be used with the minifigure. There is a printed 1x2 cheese slope for a control console and some nice gold 1x2 grills behind the seat.</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>The one minifigure included&nbsp;in this set is Cole, he is in his standard&nbsp;hand of time outfit with dark bluish&nbsp;gray and&nbsp;black as the main colors with a little brown for detail. The prints are very nice the legs and have print on the feet/boots. The face print is normal but still great. He has no mask but instead&nbsp;his standard hair piece,&nbsp;he also has a small face mask to cover his mouth.</p>

<h3>The parts</h3>

<p>The parts are ok for this se, not a real &quot;parts pack&quot; but not bad. The big dish a black ice cream cones are nice parts.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall I think this is a great polybag set and a good way to get the cool Cole minifigure,&nbsp;and the build is also good. I would recommend it if you can find it for somewhat cheap, but you can decide how much you are willing to pay for it. In the end I hope this review was helpful to you.</p>

<p>This set comes in a polybag with the normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some very nice parts in this set. You get two gold ninja swords, two 1x2 black mounted stud shooters (Yes I actually like this piece), one black three bladed propeller, two black jet engines, two black cones with a handle, one dark grey large dish, and a 1x2 dark grey roof tile with printing of a control panel. As just mentioned you get one printed piece. The total piece count for the set is 38.</p>

<p><b>Minifigure:</b></p>

<p><b>Cole:</b></p>

<p>So you get Cole in his Hands of Time form. He has his normal (slightly messy) black hair with a double-sided head. On one side you have a somewhat angry expression with a green curved thing (Don&#39;t know what it is) on the left side of his forehead. On the other side he has a smile on his face. He has a black ninja mask and printing on both sides of his torso. On the front you have grey/silver armor with the Earth symbol on it covered by black and brown robes with some brown rope going across the entire torso. On the back you have the black and brown robes with a circle with some symbol or letter in some Ninjago writing (I assume). You have some rope tied to a belt on the back as well. You also have printing on the legs as well. You have the robes from the torso continuing on down onto the legs with some rope/string wrapped around the knee area. Cole has no weapon or accessories.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:</b></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall this is a really nice polybag. The airboat itself is really nice and looks great. It has the black three bladed propeller and the large grey dish on the back with the two black jet engines that all look great. The control panel looks really good and is a nice piece to get in this set. You have two stud shooters with orange studs as the only weapons on the airboat. You get two lights on the front which add a nice look to it. Getting this version of Cole is nice as it is a newer (at the time) version of him. Getting him with a double-sided head is nice (especially in a polybag). I highly recommend getting this set if you are a fan or collector of&nbsp;Ninjago. If you aren&#39;t this will still make a nice addition to your Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
