<p>As a collector of small Lego City vehicles since the early 1980&#39;s I was delighted to find this poly bag listed for 2017 and tracked down an example via EBay for my collection.</p>

<p>Made up of over forty parts, all be it with the usual couple of spare bits and an accessory in the form of a road barrier to make up the numbers, this is a nice little set that fits in well with any City collection.</p>

<p>As per most standard poly bag sets, the instructions are on a double sided single sheet of paper with the usual panel devoted to illustrating other 2017 City sets in an attempt to tempt the receiver of the poly bag to go out and buy more Lego.</p>

<p>The build itself is very straightforward, taking fourteen stages for the vehicle itself and the barrier. &nbsp;Strangely there are no instructions for the minifigure so presumably Lego now consider everyone to be familiar with how they go together.</p>

<p>Once built you have a nice tractor or mini bulldozer using some nice orange and dark grey pieces. &nbsp;The accompanying barrier features a nice printed 1x4 yellow tile with black diagonal warning stripes pattern, no stickers here and there is both a 1x1 round tile in translucent red plus a 1x1 cheese in translucent yellow left spare.</p>

<p>There is one tiny issue with the design though, on a flat surface, if you have the dozer blade angled with the bottom edge flat on the ground then the front wheels are barely making contact with the road. &nbsp;Twisting the blade around a bit solves the problem but it does strike me as a very minor issue with the design.</p>

<p>The minifigure&nbsp;is nothing unusual, fairly standard fare who, like the guy driving&nbsp;last years 30348 Mini Dumper truck, comes with a red baseball cap rather than the expected standard workers hard hat, this oversight of Health &amp; Safety will be corrected on my one once I complete this review!!</p>

<p>Overall another nice little Poly Bag set that will no doubt come up in one of those free promotions at some point in the future.</p>
