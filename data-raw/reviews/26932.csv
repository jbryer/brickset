<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>One of the main reasons I collect creator sets is for the pieces. The 33 pieces, show that the&nbsp;designer has successfully&nbsp;used&nbsp;repetition to&nbsp;the effect that it&nbsp;shows the sets simplicity hidden behind the true creativity.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Build</strong></h3>

<p>This is a really simple set which is easy to follow and does not require any previous building experience. It won&#39;t take you long at all to complete it. Even though <u>Happy Turtle</u>&nbsp;is symmetrical, it&#39;s small enough that you don&#39;t really take into account the repetition&nbsp;experienced, at least for me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Finished Model</b></h3>

<p>Ask anyone what the model is and I guarantee&nbsp;that the response is &quot;a turtle!&quot;. The designer has successfully copied an image of a stereotypical turtle and built it into a near replica. There are some clever uses of the feet and head which use the&nbsp;Plate 1X2 Ball &Oslash;5.9 Middle connected with the&nbsp;Plate 1X2 Ball Cup / Friction Middle to allow movement and some playability as well as creating a more obvious shape for the&nbsp;<u>Happy Turtle</u>. I also like the inclusion of 1x1 round tiles on the shell to add decoration and show how turtles don&#39;t just a plain brown back.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>It was just a random set I picked up but I&#39;m glad it was the&nbsp;<u>Happy Turtle</u>&nbsp;because it really is a creative and enjoyable set. I would definitely recommend this set to others.</p>

When I showed my mom the pics of it, she thought that it looked like a Hershey crunch bar with legs, but when I get it, we both agreed that it looked much better in person. The set is easy to build and has a good amount of movement&nbsp;in the fins and head with the use of Mixles ball joints. I know that LEGO&reg;&nbsp;doesn&#39;t have the exact color in their inventory&nbsp;to accuratly capture the color of an actual sea turtle, but I think that they did a great job with what they had. One thing that I think that they could have done differently is to use a tan 2x4 plate on the bottom instead of a brown one to make it look a bit more accurate. Over all, this is a cute little polybag that I think would look great with anyones LEGO collection.</p>
