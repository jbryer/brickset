<p>Batgirl: She has all of the same parts as the numerous versions found in the LEGO Batman Movie sets, with an impressive array of printed detailing on her legs and torso. She features dual-molding with yellow boots and purple upper legs. Her facial expressions appear to be unique to this release featuring a winking happy smile and some sort of action pose expression, perhaps angry or perhaps merely exerting herself as she hurls batarangs at her foes.</p>

<p>As far as Minifigures go Batgirl is really impressive, the new cowl piece with the attachment in back for her ponytail is an excellent design choice and the overall detail used in the printing on the torso, arms and legs is extremely fun. Even her shimmering yellow cape looks great in a different material design to reflect the light in a sparkling effect.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d say this is a great free gift to get with the purchase of an excellent movie.</p>
