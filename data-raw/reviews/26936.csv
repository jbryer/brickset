The interesting thing about Duplo is that it often requires a young builder to use more imagination with less complex parts, often allowing for unique designs to be created.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a standalone set, this polybag&nbsp;leave a bit to be desired. With only 7 individual bricks in just 3 colors, the build options are rather limited. However,&nbsp;this set has&nbsp;an additional 3 build suggestions which is impressive given the low brick count.</p>

<h3><strong>One Fish:</strong></h3>

<p>The first&nbsp;fish is of the traditional style and is displayed&nbsp;on the package. It uses all 7 bricks and the Red 2x4 Curved top for the front. The fins of this fish are orange and are in the midsection of the body. Main fish sports a yellow fin and stripes.</p>

<h3><strong>Two Fish:</strong></h3>

<p>The second fish I think resembles more of a puffer&nbsp;fish, with the yellow fins more near the top of the body. It has an Orange 2x4 Curved top for the face and a wide yellow belly and red fin.</p>

<h3><strong>Chicken Fish:</strong></h3>

<p>The third build is a chicken. It is not a fish. It uses the printed Red 2x2 Eye brick on top with the Yellow 2x4 Curved top to resemble the beak. It stands on red feet and has a yellow tail. This build only uses 5 bricks.</p>

<h3><strong>Flying Fish:</strong></h3>

<p>This last build uses the least amount of bricks, but the most amount of imagination. Using just 3 bricks, this flying fish has yellow fins, an orange belly and red face. You can build him a small cave using the remaining 4 bricks if you wish; you can enen choose a orange or red roof (or both)</p>

<h3><strong>Conclusions:</strong></h3>

<p>Alone, this set is just okay. I applaud the designer to trying to include the extra 3 builds for such a small set. This is a better purchase if your child has additional Duplo bricks and is looking to add to the collection.</p>
