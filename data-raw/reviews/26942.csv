This is great for anyone who wants to add functions to their own creations but are not good at connecting technic to system parts. There are only two ports however, but a motor is build into the power brick so it works in that respect. The ports on it are not compatible&nbsp;with the ports you get with Mindstorms&nbsp;so you can&#39;t use them with each other. This is a great set for kids to get into programing because the free app that you can get with this has simple programing features that allow for fun play. I only built the main model and haven&#39;t tried out the other 4 builds. The arms don&#39;t have any motorized&nbsp;function and can only move up and down. I like the function that they have for this thing to grab things. In all, this is a good set for beginners. If you want something more advanced, I recommend that you buy the LEGO&reg; EV3 kit.</p>
