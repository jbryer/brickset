<br />
911719 Kanan Jarrus is a small foil pack that includes exactly what is advertised on the foil packaging: a Kanan Jarrus LEGO minifigure from the Rebels subtheme.<br />
<br />
I recently got this small foil pack for my birthday among other sets like the Havoc Marauder and the Boba Fett Helmet. I&#39;ve been getting into the Rebels TV series, enjoying it more than I did when it first aired. I didn&#39;t collect any Star Wars sets back then, much less any Rebels sets, and most of the listings nowadays on eBay are super overpriced. I just wanted a Rebels protagonist minifigure that was sealed, and I found the perfect opportunity: a sealed 911719 for $23 AUD, a price that can be considered reasonable currently, taking into account the fact that this figure last appeared in a 2017 set. (usually I like to get figures sealed, like in polybags or foil packs like this one, or even advent calendar gifts split from the calendar itself)<br />
<br />
<strong>Packaging</strong><br />
<br />
911719, being an older foil pack, has rectangular dimensions rather than the more square design like&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/911839-1/Obi-Wan-Kenobi"">911839 Obi-Wan Kenobi</a>. There are some nice designs&nbsp;on&nbsp;the foil packaging, featuring the Rogue One box art, and a CGI Kanan Jarrus image as well as a LEGO Kanan Jarrus image, with some small descriptions like the Rebels logo and Kanan&#39;s name.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contents and Build</strong><br />
<br />
This set includes 6 LEGO pieces: Kanan&#39;s brown hairpiece, his head, torso, legs, as well as the two hilt and blade pieces that form his blue bladed lightsaber. Together these pieces make up the titular Kanan Jarrus. (it took me about five seconds to put everything together, so it was really easy.)<br />
<br />
Foil packs like these are usually gifts that come with LEGO magazines published by Immediate Media, and these packs usually don&#39;t come with instructions - the instructions would be included on pages of the magazine. Since this&nbsp;set is essentially just a minifigure, this is not much of an issue -&nbsp;it is very easy to build, even for the most inexperienced of beginners. (however this may be a bit of an issue for other similar foil packs like the Star Wars ships and locations microbuilds)<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigure</strong><br />
<br />
This figure represents Kanan&#39;s attire from Seasons 1 and 2 of Rebels - before all the character design changes - therefore has the armor that covers Kanan&#39;s right arm and chest. The printed designs&nbsp;closely resemble that of the&nbsp;onscreen character - the green armour on the chest with some metallic detailing, and a black armour strap around the torso which of course continues onto the back. There are also some straps which lead from a clip from the&nbsp;belt onto the legs, which represent the holster for Kanan&#39;s blaster, as well as kneepads on both sides.&nbsp;The hairpiece, fortunately, is brown and not the original albeit incorrect black color. It has a nice ponytail mould on the back.<br />
<br />
Kanan&#39;s head is in a&nbsp;nougat tone, which was a colour that wasn&#39;t widely used until about when it was used for the more recent Clone Trooper minifigures. The facial expressions printed on the head are great in my opinion - one is a neutral frown and the other is a confident grin, both accurate to the onscreen character&#39;s expressions.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kanan&#39;s right arm is&nbsp;dark green, which nicely contrasts against the sand green torso and the other arm. In the show, Kanan has a small shoulder pad over the armour, but this is not represented on the figure. While I do not think a separate piece perhaps attached on the neck is not needed, it would have been great to have some printing of&nbsp;the symbol on the shoulder pad from the show.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
One of the negative aspects about this small set is that it doesn&#39;t include <em>all</em> of Kanan&#39;s accessories. In Rebels, Kanan wields a lightsaber as well as a blaster. In other sets that he appears in, both accessories are included, so the omission of the blaster is quite unfortunate.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The minifigure parts included are surprisingly generic, which in my opinion is great for custom minifigures.<br />
<br />
<strong>Playability</strong><br />
<br />
The playability that this set offers is extremely limited, but children would have fun swinging Kanan&nbsp;around hitting invisible enemies or ones from their own collection. I would say that this minifigure would best fit in Star Wars Rebels&nbsp;LEGO dioramas and MOCs.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall thoughts</strong><br />
<br />
911719 Kanan Jarrus, to me, is a great introduction to the Star Wars Rebels subtheme, and I&#39;m really excited to try and expand my Star Wars collection with some smaller and/or cheaper Rebels sets - only now do some of the sets&nbsp;truly look appealing, for example&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75078-1/Imperial-Troop-Transport"">75078 Imperial Troop Transport</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It&#39;s also a great little minifigure to have in your collection if you are a fan of Rebels and would like to have some of its LEGO merch.</p>
