I saw this set when the images were first leaked/released and I instantly loved it. Not only was it an Astromech Droid (I&#39;m a huge fan) but it was an R3 with a trans-black (or brown) dome plus it was presented in a very unique way. The set, as I mentioned before, was very slippery and elusive. But, through an awesome trade via Swapfig, I have it. Let&#39;s dive in.</p>

<p><br />
THE BAG AND INSTRUCTIONS<br />
The bag is not the typical crinkly polybag. It&#39;s the newer, more smooshy design. It&#39;s also fairly small, smaller than a normal poly, which surprised me. Sporting the Rogue One design, it has the name, the set number, parts count and everything it should, though the warning about the small ball is...odd. I never understood it. Many sets have that warning, but only about 20% (DISCLAIMER: This is a totally guesstimated statistic) actually include one.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ghqywdzqb/Bag.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The back of the bag doesn&#39;t have much to see.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/wsr2sip0z/Bag-_Back.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Now, the instructions: they are tiny! Really tiny!&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/91rpa9jn7/Instructions-_Folded_With_R3.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>It&#39;s smaller than any poly instructions I&#39;ve ever seen. Unlike many other polys, it has a parts checklist. That&#39;s really all that&#39;s interesting here.</p>

<p><br />
THE PARTS<br />
Well, this set definitely isn&#39;t a parts pack. The most interesting piece&nbsp;is the new, exclusive plastic backing for R3-M2&#39;s stand. That&#39;s pretty neat. The rest of the pieces are nothing special, but they serve their purpose.</p>

<p><br />
THE BUILD<br />
Quick, simple, nothing to get excited about. The one thing I want to point out, though, is that the pieces were packaged like a boxed set and not just thrown in the bag. Oh, and there&#39;s one sticker for the name plaque.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE COMPLETED MODEL<br />
While the build isn&#39;t the main focus of the set, it&#39;s still really neat.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/rim4137b7/Stand-_Rear.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>It looks great and makes this set stand out from previous Star Wars minifig-only polybags. The fact that it can connect to 40176: Scarif Stormtrooper makes it even more appealing.</p>

<p><br />
THE MINIFIGURE...ER, DROID<br />
R3-M2. A very obscure character that you only see vaguely once or twice, has been made into a toy once and no one will recognize him.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/jolifo4n7/R3-01.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>I love it! Obscure Astromech Droids are great, especially when they have trans-color heads! R3&#39;s color scheme is cool, dark reddish brown on white with silver highlights, but it makes it extremely hard to see the details on his dome.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/mvg1zkrqr/R3-02.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>I wish Lego had made the brown print on his dome more red, like it shows in the instructions. Anyway, moving on to the body.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/6lpvwc99f/R3-_Torso.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 414px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;R3&#39;s body is unique because, unlike R2-D2, the stripes running down his sides aren&#39;t exactly on the side. Well, one is, but the other is almost in the center. The rest of his body print is excellent as well, looking similar to the usual Astromech print, but slightly different.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ke4asev0j/R3-03.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>There&#39;s no print on his back, but it doesn&#39;t bother me because Lego has never done print on the back of Astromechs, same for the legs.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/8qa8xe8b7/R3-04.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>I think that leg and back printing could have improved R3, but he looks great without it. The dome has excellent printing all the way around (I got lucky. The silver line going around R3&#39;s dome is mostly level) when you can see it. The trans-black/brown dome is one of the big pros to me, since it isn&#39;t very common. I just wish the printing was more visible.</p>

<p><br />
OVERALL<br />
This set is great for Star Wars fans, especially if you are like me and happen to love collecting random Astromech Droids. The stand is an excellent addition to the set and it makes a nice change from the minifig-only polys. The packaging is different, but in a good way. It&#39;s more durable, so it won&#39;t fall apart if you want to keep it.</p>

I know this set won&#39;t appeal to everyone, but I&#39;m really glad Lego made it! If you want to buy it, then I definitely encourage you to do so. Just don&#39;t pay too much (the ever present challenge of being a Lego collector)<br />

"vikings","2018-12-25T00:23:32.943Z","Okay ","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in polybag. It just shows R3-M2 on his stand. The instruction manual is the normal small on that comes in polybags.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Nothing really special in bricks. The background that goes behind R3-M2&nbsp;is really cool for the display part and then the sticker that goes on the 1x4 black piece that has R3&#39;s&nbsp;name on it is really nice as well. The total piece count on this is 21 pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I was actually a little disappointed with the dome part of R3. The dome is clear so all the dark printing in certain lighting is really hard to see the printing on it. The printing on the front of it is really good and when you can see the printing on the dome is also really good as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Really simple nothing to it. Took me a minute to build it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Once it was finished it is really good display item. The figure is okay due to my opinion on the dome. Really nice with it all put together and background with the label&nbsp;were also nice editions to the stand as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>My overall opinion is that the stand is great and the figure is okay due to the problems with the dome. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"I_am_Groot","2018-06-06T04:17:01.317Z","Not the best polybag choice, but still a good figure.","<p>This is a review of the Star Wars R3-M2 polybag. It&#39;s retail price was $6.00 and it contains 21 pieces. As you all know, this was the first polybag to come with a both a figure and a display stand. The display stand looks pretty nice, aside from the &quot;Copyright junk&quot; on the backdrop, as JANGBRiCKS once said.&nbsp;Fortunately&nbsp;they have removed this from the newer figures. There is also a sticker that says R3-M2. You can connect this with all of the other display stands in this series. R3-M2 himself is a fantastic astromech droid figure. The printing on her body is very accurate in both&nbsp;it&#39;s design and colors. Unfortunately,&nbsp;as always, there is no printing&nbsp;on the back of the body.&nbsp;The head is in trans black/brown, which is very uncommon. It&#39;s not&nbsp;the perfect color, but it still&nbsp;It looks good and is printed on the front and back. It would have been nice if there was no trans brown/black showing under the printed silver stripe, but I think that is a&nbsp;little too much to&nbsp;ask.&nbsp;It would have been fantastic had there been printing on the legs, but LEGO has never done that before.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, a very good astromech figure that I am very happy to add to my collection, BUT I still would have rather have gotten Saw Gererra or Galen Erso. This is currently going for under $7 on eBay, so I would recommend picking it up while the price is still low.&nbsp;</p>

"Slobrojoe","2020-01-18T17:11:33.383Z","Astromechs never get old...","<p>Rogue One, a Star Wars story, has brought 12 new Lego sets, 3 of which are poly bags and 2 are battle packs. This is R3-M2.</p>

<p>The set is packed in a poly bag. It includes a fold-out instruction leaflet,&nbsp;which has easy to follow steps.</p>

<p>This build takes no longer than 2 minutes. R3-M2 is only seen a couple of times in the film but when he is, it&#39;s next to a Y-Wing. As a&nbsp;Rebel Alliance&nbsp;droid, he&#39;s always shuffling around the base. The droid has a clear dome with light brown printing that is hard to see. The main body is white with normal tools and features printed on. The two legs are plain white. The figure is composed of 4 parts. It stands on a base, that we all know and love,&nbsp;from the Collectible Minifigure&nbsp;series. The backdrop is a colossal ship that is held by light grey bushes. A sticker is placed on the front, stating what he&#39;s called. A small connector pin allows it to join onto other characters in the same series like the Scarif&nbsp;Stormtrooper (see my review).</p>

<p>This minifig&nbsp;fits in with any Lego Star&nbsp;Wars Rebel base across the galaxy.</p>
