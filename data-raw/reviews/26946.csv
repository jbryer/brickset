"Michel_Ange","2017-02-07T20:11:48.673Z","A cute and nicely built addition to any submarine scene","<p>A pretty straightforward and sturdy build in line with the good old Lego tradition. The&nbsp;body is twice the length of a minifig, which makes it exactly to scale with an adult narwhal, and its shape conveys exactly the right amount of rounded chunkiness you&#39;d expect from such an animal. The fins allow for some limited poseability. The big sleepy eyes are a break from reality, but they make it look so cute !</p>

<p>The piece selection is of course limited, but very sensible and easy to reuse.</p>

<p>To sum it up, for it&#39;s size it is a very good little set, and a perfect addition to any arctic or undersea scene.</p>
