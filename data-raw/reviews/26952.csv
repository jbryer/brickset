<p>Birthday card is a very mediocre freebie that was particularly interested in how to get it .</p>

<p>The Minifigures-</p>

<p>The minifigure&nbsp;is a nice civilian to add to the collection with a good torso print and nice unopened red small legs . The Accessorys include a 1&times;1 pink cupcake piece and another head and hair for you to change between a female and male figure .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>&nbsp;The build tarts on a 4&times;4 lime green plate with a basic table , present and cake design .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a very mediocre set and to get it you had to have the already hard to get Lego calendar take out the coupon for the from the back take it to the Lego store and say it is your birthday very far fetched and I would recommend it to fans of random bits of Lego that isn&#39;t very well known .&nbsp;</p>
