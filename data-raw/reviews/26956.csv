<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the pics and YouTube reviews the model looks meh. But once built and played with, it looks decent enough. Pretty slick looking tank. But totally fails as a flying spaceship. I&rsquo;m looking at you, big rubber wheels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My main goal was to collect the Axl figures and they don&rsquo;t disappoint. The minifigs&nbsp;are superb.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a parts pick I would say this is a winner. Nice mix of system and technics parts. Great colors too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My son played with this for hours. It&rsquo;s a good grab if you can get it on discount.&nbsp;</p>
