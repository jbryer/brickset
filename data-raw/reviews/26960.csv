<p>Included in each pack are 5 different Nexo&nbsp;Powers in 5 different colours and a Holder for 3 powers</p>

<p>Lets look at the money incinerator lego set :)</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>To go with 5 powers is a stand that uses 5 elements. The main part is a triangular plate with a technic sized hole through the centre, the part can hold only 3 of the 5 powers in each pack which is ludicrous to me. Also there&rsquo;s a connector which is built out of 2x2 dark blue tile (which is the ;most useful part to be honest) on top of 2 1x2 plates with clips on 1 side in light gray on top of a 2x2 rounded inverted trans neon orange plate.</p>

<p>The connectors are connected to one of the 3 minifig sized bars on the massive 3 holder thingy.</p>

<p><b>35 Nexo&nbsp;Powers</b></p>

<p>The 35 powers are in 5 colour groups: Trans Red, Trans Blue, Trans Green, Trans Clear and Trans Yellow. I look at each shield in its colour&nbsp;group and i&rsquo;ll name the design printed onto it. Let&rsquo;s go :/</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
