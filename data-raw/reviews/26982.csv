The world of LEGO DC Super Heroes is expanded on further with information on these pages and this review will discuss the contents before concluding if this title is worth picking up.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Presentation</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">We start off with the presentation, the book is quite well put together and the photos all tell a compelling narrative, for the younger readers this will be a great treat. There is much to see in the novel, many images of characters, vehicles and sets of the past several years of DC Comics Super Hero and LEGO Batman sets. Everything is written from an in-universe perspective with exception to the fun fact blurbs that discuss trivia and facts about the LEGO items or characters of the DC universe.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Much of these pages are full of topics that have not been covered entirely in previous novels, as it is written from an in-universe perspective, meaning discussing events that take place in the stories found in LEGO Batman and DC specials, movies and set descriptions with elements of the movies included. This is different from the Visual Dictionary, though perhaps not the Character Encyclopedia.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minifigure</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Wonder Woman: A new look for Wonder Woman, this Minifigure is extremely well detailed with double-sided torso, leg printing a dual-sided facial expression seen on past iterations of the character and her trademark hair piece. She also includes her lasso of truth as an accessory.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This costume is different from what we&rsquo;ve seen in the past, I do not have extensive knowledge of the character or her costume changes, however I&rsquo;m fairly certain this is a newer look inspired by classic designs. Definitely a welcome change from the numerous alternate Bat costumes we&rsquo;ve seen/had in the past. Hopefully LEGO will make a Minifigure of Power Girl in the future so we can have a more diverse looking group of characters.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The presentation section of the review covered much of what you will find for the contents. That being said it is very well put together, the book has information that I, as a casual fan who doesn&rsquo;t entirely memorize everything can find no fault with. It&rsquo;s very entertaining and there are a lot of well put together pages of information on anything and everything you could hope for from the LEGO DC Universe. It&rsquo;s much more interesting compared to some of the similar LEGO Star Wars books we&rsquo;ve gotten in the past.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">All of the current sets are featured in some fashion with exception to the Mighty Micros, as they are not part of the main LEGO DC Universe fiction wise. Also the Wonder Woman set was more than likely not ready before this book went to publication so that particular set of 2017 is not present, nor are any of the LEGO Batman Movie sets as they will have their own book soon.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Overall I feel that this novel is quite well put together, the contents are informative and interesting, and not as bland or often ignorantly misidentified as some of the LEGO Star Wars offerings have been recently. A lot of research was used during the making of this title I&rsquo;d wager and there is nothing left out, although of course not all Polybags will be referenced as they are mostly micro-builds of existing sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I would recommend this on the grounds that it is a nice title with decent information concerning the characters, sets, lore and other elements found in the LEGO DC Universe. The inclusion of a new outfit for Wonder Woman is also a must have for fans of the character and so I definitely recommend this title.</span></span></span></span></p>
