I&rsquo;d mildly recommend this set, it&rsquo;s great the Minifigures, but the rest is a bit disappointing.</span></span></span></span></p>

"redbeardlegoman","2017-12-30T22:49:53.247Z","The signal goes on and he shows up.","<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>A bat signal, a couple of GCPD officers, and Chief O&#39;Hara.&nbsp; Perhaps a touch pricey, but still worthwhile.<br />
<br />
<strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>As with most recent accessory packs, this comes on a blister card.&nbsp; I never saved them on my He-Man figures, and it&#39;s no different with these.&nbsp; Rip.&nbsp; Toss.&nbsp; Build.<br />
<br />
The Instructions are on a folded sheet.&nbsp; I rarely say anything about instructions, but today I shall.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve never liked the folded sheet instructions for polybags or small sets.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if a tiny stapled booklet is feasible, but I&#39;d like to see something different.&nbsp; The folded sheets don&#39;t sit well in storage until they&#39;ve been squashed under the complete Usagi Yojimbo&nbsp;graphic novel library for a year.<br />
<br />
<strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>I love the motorcycle helmet, and Chief O&#39;Hara&#39;s hair now being available in black.<br />
<br />
And there is something aesthetically pleasing about the dome of the bat signal.&nbsp; If it&#39;s not too weird to love the look of a good single piece, then let me say that I love these half-spheres.&nbsp; I think they&#39;ve always added a great look to any build.<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>I think the head and helmet of the motorcycle cop will help me to perfect my LEGO Village People.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The other officer is simply well-executed.&nbsp; And, since he doesn&#39;t have any GCPD on his uniform, he could easily be used for, say a Police Academy graduation ceremony MOC.<br />
<br />
As for <strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sh399/chief-o-hara"">Chief O&#39;Hara</a></strong>, I&#39;m always happy to have another actual character to add to my Gotham City display.&nbsp; I especially love her tired eyes, and the badge worn on the hip.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Build</strong><br />
<br />
The minfigures are already built - saving you upwards of ten seconds.&nbsp; The bat signal itself does not take very long to build.&nbsp; I think, though, that it&#39;s simplicity lends itself well to the completed model.&nbsp; In a few steps we have an instantly recognizable bat signal.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t have/can&#39;t afford/can&#39;t find either the <strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70917-1/The-Ultimate-Batmobile"">70917 Ultimate Batmobile</a></strong>, or the <strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/5004930-1/Accessory-pack"">5004930 Accessory Pack</a></strong>, both of which are superior bat signals in my mind, then this is a great alternative.<br />
<br />
It also has the advantage of being easier for younger or less-developed builders to assemble, and then add to the roof of the GCPD HQ.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Which reminds me, I have to dig out a spare turn-table piece...<br />
<br />
<strong>The Completed Model / Overall Opinion</strong><br />
<br />
The bat signal looks good, if not great.&nbsp; The three cops are wonderful for fleshing out Gotham&#39;s Finest.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It is, however, a bit on the pricey side, and that could put you off.&nbsp; If you can find it on clearance, then it&#39;s totally worth picking up.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Needless to say, completists (like me) will have to get it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There are better bat signals out there (and worse - I&#39;m looking at you<strong> <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76044-1/Clash-of-the-Heroes"">76044 Clash of the Heroes</a></strong>), but they tend to be in hard-to-find and/or expensive sets.&nbsp; For kids and the fiscally limited, this is a fair compromise.</p>

"brickengineeringdude","2019-05-23T23:40:52.75Z","Excellent!","<p><strong>What&#39;s Included</strong></p>

<p><strong>-</strong>Police officer with hat: This guy has an awesome face print, The hat looks great, and the&nbsp;torso and leg printing are also great with a printed arm with a badge and dual-molded legs. It&#39;s nice to get a reddish brown&nbsp;minifig head because these are pretty rare.</p>

<p>-Police officer with helmet: This guy&#39;s face print looks okay,(I&#39;ve never seen a beard like this)&nbsp;but the helmet is nice, as well as the torso which has GCPD printed on the back which I guess&nbsp;stands for &quot;Gotham City Police Department&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Detective: (I think) The hair is nice, the face print , the torso has a printed holster that&#39;s to-scale and way out of scale compared to the gun included. the legs are printed with a belt and badge, and the minifigure&nbsp;looks good overall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bat-signal (I think that&#39;s what it&#39;s called) looks good, a trans-clear dome would have been better and looked more like a light. You do get a 2x2 round plate with bat logo, and the pneumatic hose connectors are useful.</p>

<p>The three accessories are:&nbsp;</p>

<p>An (Alien Conquest?)&nbsp;gun,&nbsp;and I think there&#39;s only one other police set with a gun,&nbsp;853570.</p>

<p>Binoculars in dark bluish gray,</p>

<p>and handcuffs.</p>

<p>I recommend buying this set, but with a discount would be better. I recently bought this set at LEGO Shop at Home, on a discount.</p>
