<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are really only 4 true LEGO parts. The others are a couple of cardboard circles and a few cards that seem to be a part of a game, but no instructions are given so it is very confusing. The only true LEGO pieces are two 1x1 round plates (one Trans neon orange and one navy blue), an exclusive NEXO&nbsp;KNIGHTS shield print, and one of the pieces that hold three NEXO KNIGHT shields on a key chain.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Play</strong></p>

<p>As stated earlier, there are no instructions to there is no way of knowing how to play the game</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>The only reason to pick up this set would be for the exclusive print and key chain. Other than that, it is pretty strange and has very little value to it. Only completions of the theme should get this, and even then it has no display or play value.</p>
