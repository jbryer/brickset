"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-13T07:48:04Z","Ace fighter","This is a superb set which produces a very accurate rendition of a WW1 Fokker Dr.1 triplane as flown by Manfred von Richthofen. Stickers (mainly crosses) include correct serial number for one of the many he flew. I made this before the Sopwith Camel so was not aware that construction wise it was based upon that. Inspired by this I have subsequently obtained the Camel, but the Dr.1 is superior in construction - possibly because it is a triplane. The wings are less flimsy and feature working control surfaces as does the tail plane. Machine guns are also done better. The rotary engine is created in the same clever way as the Camel and looks very good. Although the cowling is see through due to the use of balustrade bricks it does have the advantage of allowing you to see that the engine rotates along with the prop just as it should. This makes up into a large and impressive accurate model. Normally I like to modify my sets to make them even more accurate, but there really was nothing I could do here to improve things so it has to be a 10 which I rarely give.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-24T11:06:08Z","My Favorite Model","This set is a MODEL of the Red Baron, a very accurate and detailed one, as well. It has all the right signs on it, and I don't even mind the use of stickers. The model is broken down into two main sections: the front, and the back. When completely assembled, it is very stable, but unfortunately, due to the massive wings, it tends to fall apart while you are building it. In the end, though, it is well worth it. Some of the nice features include a spinning propeller, a very detailed cockpit with lots of controls. I like the little guns towards the front, and the tail in the back. It's definitely one of the best Lego sets ever created. An amazing 10/10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I realise this may be an old set now but it may still be available in some places. I loved this set, although unaccredited, the review entitled “Ace Fighter” is mine. I still think it is one of the best sets of all time, but I thought I would update you on a problem – and not just with this set. 

A fair time has lapsed since I made this and I am disappointed to report the stickers are beginning to peel off from the edges (there is a good example of the problem on this set shown on Brickshelf). I have similar problems with other sets notably Ferraris, where after a while the stickers begin to peel from the edges. Lego needs to do something about this, otherwise please make all of us very happy and stop doing stickers – unless absolutely the only way to achieve a desired effect – without the stickers some of the Ferraris rely on to “make the right shape” they are going look decidedly ordinary – at least the Triplane still looks like what it is – and that is really the mark of a good set – if you need stackers to fool they eye into making shapes you can’t make with bricks why bother.

Lego please stop using stickers if you can't make them last more than a year without peeling off.
