Great box design.</span></span></span></span></p>

Though it is nice that they&rsquo;ve improved on the design of the parts and part use for these things over the years. The floppy limbed skeletons are a bit old hat these days thanks to droid arm style skeletons.</span></span></span></span></p>

The face is a tad generic looking when it comes to prints unfortunately, I believe I&rsquo;ve seen this print before, but I&rsquo;m not entirely certain. He kind of looks like Cole from the LEGO Ninjago Movie.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The main build features relatively repetitive and easy to follow steps for most of the back and the front doorway which is mirrored. Overall nothing tricky or difficult as is customary in such a small set, honestly it was a while since I built it, but I recall it being relatively quick and somewhat lackluster until the finished model was done.</span></span></span></span></p>

Almost as if the model was a play set piece for a stage. The red spider on the one door adds creepier atmosphere to the thing. A fun little model and much better executed than the fa&ccedil;ade from the last Halloween vignette with the trick-or-treating girl.</span></span></span></span></p>

Finding it for a reasonable price now that it&rsquo;s off the primary market may be difficult, that being said, it&rsquo;s a strong offering and the jack-o-lantern mask is a great touch. Strongly recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 3 best &quot;spooky&quot; Lego sets to me are the Haunted House, Hearse, and this one.&nbsp; What makes this set underrated is the ways colors and perspective are used.&nbsp; Sure, the aesthetic is great, with opening gates, hinged front for more access, and fun side builds, but there is more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The use of the more drab green for dying plants and purple for more nighttime moodiness are great.&nbsp; Also, the use of the key orange to make the background look like the sun is setting in the background is really well done.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The small building in front of the rounded orange background really makes it feel like I am in the cemetery, looking out the gate onto the setting sun behind the distant building.&nbsp; The use of a technic brick to show light shining through is a good touch.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know of no other set that is so evocative and really lets me know where I am, and what cardinal direction I am actually facing!&nbsp; This set is more impressive in person, to me.&nbsp; I was glad to pick it up.&nbsp; It would be a bit difficult to piece out, so getting it complete second hand is probably the way to go.</p>
