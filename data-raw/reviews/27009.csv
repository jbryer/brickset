"Koot","2018-01-09T07:46:59.307Z","LEGO Star Wars 75193 Millennium Falcon Microfighter","<p>LEGO has made a remake of the 2014 Millennium Falcon Microfighter. The main difference is the inclusion of Chewbacca&nbsp;instead of Han Solo.</p>

<p><strong>The Model:</strong></p>

<p>The model is extremely&nbsp;similar to the previous version, however this Millennium Falcon is The Force Awakens version, having the different&nbsp;radar dish. Additionally, the model has stud shooters instead of flick missiles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I find the overall shape very accurate but still has that microfighter look about it. The printed cockpit piece is very nice, and the back engine thruster is built and curved well.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s not much to say - it&#39;s Chewie. I dont know about you, but the new version of Chewbacca is starting to grow on me. The crossbow is nice, but I&nbsp;am sure some of you would have liked the stud shooter crossbow instead.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall, this is a great set, with a very reasonable price. It is good that LEGO remade it so kids who missed out on the old one have a chance at getting it again. If you have the older one and are not interested, no harm in having to pass up a remake.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and I hope this was very helpful.</p>

"abordoli","2018-01-11T04:52:17.62Z","Not That Much Different Than The Han Version","<p>Minor difference to the Han Solo version (figure, radar and shooters&nbsp;mostly). It is an inexpensive way to get the Chewbacca character, for sure. Except for the popularity of the Millennium Falcon (and Chewie), I&#39;m not quite sure why a re-release of virtually the same ship came so soon after the first version.<br />
<br />
I feel this is a great buy if you missed the Han Solo version and/or if you are a completionist collector.</p>

"Trueblox","2018-12-23T17:52:26.597Z","A good timewaster and a good microfighter shelf-display!","<p>So i got this as a present not long ago from my parents who were in hungary at the time. They got me this as they know i just started liking the Star Wars sets (Especially the Death Star, my god do i want it) and so they got me this.</p>

<p>Wait, i forgot to say the intro... oops.</p>

<p>Hi, my name is Trueblox and today i will review set 75193: Millennium Falcon microfighter! The set contains 92 pieces and the price, well... I&nbsp;don&#39;t know. Like i said, my parents bought it as a gift.</p>

<p>Lets go take a look at the box:</p>

<p>The front contains the M.F (thats how i will be reffering to it cause im lazy) tilted and also showing the stud shooter shooting a stud with Chewbacca sitting where the cockpit for the M.F is. There&#39;s also a corner explosion and 2 TIE fighters shooting green lazers. Oh, and Chewie is shooting some red lazers&nbsp;with the crossbow.</p>

<p>The back shows the other Microfighter series 5 sets. For some reason this is the only set which doesn&#39;t come with an enemy&nbsp;ship, as it is separated, it should have come with a TIE fighter. It shows the M.F on the ground and Chewie&nbsp;shooting the TIE. It shows the stud shooter shooting in a tiny box too.</p>

<p>Lets get to the build now!&nbsp;</p>

<p>It looks simple, and just like the name; it&#39;s basically a miniature M.F. It has 2 stud shoots on the top of the build. That&#39;s literally it.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s look at the figure!</p>

<p>The figure is Chewbacca, and he&#39;s the Chewie&nbsp;from the Death Star. (Hey at least now i can get a discount on the set, haha) And he looks&nbsp;amazing. He comes with a crossbow accessory which is pretty nice. The torso he has is brown and has no details at all, because his head is also his fur, and it covers up the torso. The legs are brown, and have fur printing on them. That&#39;s it for him.</p>

<p>Overall opinion: It&#39;s good. Not the best, but it&#39;s good. If you want to get a good mini Star Wars display item; get this, Or if your kid asks for a lego set, get &#39;em this, it will keep him on it for a few days. ( Possibly, not 100% Guaranteed.) Plus, it&#39;s the cheapest way to get Chewbacca, at least i think so. So, that&#39;s my opinion in this tiny set. Hope you enjoyed!</p>

"Minifig290","2018-02-21T17:23:35.36Z","A Great Re-Make","<p>What a great re-make from LEGO, this set has 92 parts and retails for &pound;9, $10 and was released as part of the winter 2018 Star Wars wave and is one of my favorites of that wave.</p>

<p><b>Minifigure</b></p>

<p>Chewbacca hasn&#39;t come in a set under &pound;20 for a long while so to get him in a cheap set is great, he is the same version that appeared in the 2017 Desert Skiff Escape set that retail for &pound;30. His torso has no printing his legs just have some fur print that continues onto his head piece. His accessory is a bow which isn&#39;t the stud shooter one just the boring single molded one.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>As in any other Micro Fighter for &pound;9 there is only one build. This build is better than the other 2018 micro fighter for &pound;9 the Tie Fighter as it is packed with play features. There are two stud shooters on the top of the ship in gray, that is the only play feature. Chewy can sit in the cockpit comfortably an has&nbsp;enough space to fit his bow in his hand while sitting.&nbsp;There is a lot of detail on the ship like the Force Awakens radar and different colors that represent damage and paint (I think). At the front there are two lights and a exclusive printed astromech droid head piece that is only exclusive cause the color of the print and that is it. The back has blue pieces that show the engine but not much else.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Although there are 92 parts there are some good pieces like all the parts for Chewbacca and if you like stud shooters there are two in light bluish gray, also the exclusive print for the cockpit is in a dark gray. The is also a 2x4x2x2 L plate piece (i have no clue what it is called) in dark gray.</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To finish this review, i would recommend this micro fighter to any Star Wars fan as it is a cheap small set but it includes a iconic character and ship from the franchise. Comparing this set to the original&nbsp;2014 Millennium Falcon Micro Fighter this is better and has a better character but something about the older one makes it better but I don&#39;t know what that is</p>

<p><strong>Pros- </strong>Cheap and Easy way to get Chewbacca, Great iconic build, Good selection of parts.</p>

<p><strong>Cons- </strong>Chewbacca&#39;s bow isn&#39;t the stud shooter version</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-12-04T07:15:34.747Z","Incredibly detailed for such a small set. My 5 year old loves it!","<p>I got this for my 5 year old who had no problem assembling it all by himself, although he of course liked to have me with him as he built it. So as you can probably guess, the build is fairly simple and straight forward. There are a lot of small bricks (and therefore it came with 10 extra bricks), but they of course are what make the ship so detailed. The toughest part of the build for a little one is getting the correct angled plates as it is a fairly symmetrical set.</p>

<p>The stud shooters are great as they are very easy for younger kids to use, our other microfighters have flick missiles which are impossible for my son to use.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Chewie&nbsp;minifigure&nbsp;is nicely detailed, a huge improvement over the older ones we have that are solid brown. And even though we already have Chewie, my son was still excited since wookies&nbsp;are so much cooler than people (sorry Han, but you look like everyone else). My son was a little confused why Chewie would sit on top, but he got over that in a split second.</p>

<p>The ship is the same size as any other microfighters, and while that may not be accurate, it makes the entire series very playable with. Nothing really moves on the set but of course the fun in the set is in flying the ship, and firing the stud shooters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While I wouldn&rsquo;t trade in my 7965 Falcon for this, I also wouldn&rsquo;t give that set to my son yet to play with. Not that I&rsquo;m worried about him breaking it, but that I&nbsp;fear that the build&nbsp;would overwhelm him and that he would have a very hard time holding it. For a small kid this is easily the best Falcon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t feel that this set lends itself well to redesigns (at least not for a 5 year old), certainly the Juniors sets are much better for that. But it is a more complex and challenging build that is a great step up from the Juniors sets and a logical stepping stone towards larger Lego sets for little ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For older kids I would think that larger sets with more moving parts would be more fun, really all you can do is fly this set. But given the size of the other Falcons out there (and the price), this set is probably a wise pickup for any age kid who wants a Falcon they can easily fly around.&nbsp;</p>

"Breyden_N_LEGO","2019-12-11T04:15:08.873Z","Another standard vehicle...","<p>Welcome! As you can tell,&nbsp;I&#39;ve&nbsp;decided to begin on reviewing sets. Don&#39;t expect them to be perfect for this time around. With that being said, today I&#39;ll review set 75193 Millennium Falcon Microfighter. This set I got it over the summer, mostly to get on my hands a new Chewie after my interest in LEGO. The Millennium Falcon is undoubtedly one of the most recognizable ships in the saga, which unsurprisingly means that it gets multiple remakes ever since 2000, from standard-sized sets to the UCS ones. This MF was inspired from the sequel trilogy version, so it&#39;s a nice redesign from&nbsp;the 2014 75030 OT version, although that one has 94 pieces for the same prize that you&#39;d have with this one with 92 pieces. Still, there&#39;s&nbsp;plenty of more to the set than just that.</p>

<h3>Box and instructions</h3>

<p>The front of the box features a background of hyperspace with Chewbacca&nbsp;displayed riding the Millennium Falcon. It doesn&#39;t have the top bar of the 2018 sets with Rey, Finn and Poe, due to the small size, which is understandable. The back features the MF once again with Chewie and in the background you can see the 75194 Tie-Fighter (I&#39;ll make a review of that one soon). The instructions are very small with only about 30 or so pages. Nothing too exciting other than&nbsp;the advertisements for&nbsp;a lot of the Jan. 2018 sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Only one minifigure is included in the set (not that it&#39;s unexpected or anything) that being Chewbacca himself. I really got this set just for him as I didn&#39;t have versions of his current version used today. This Chewbacca version was introduced as a redesign in 2014 replacing the old version used through 2000. This Chewie version looks fantastic to me. While some people prefer his classic version, I personally prefer this version as a big improvement. The old one didn&#39;t feature good printing (which was common for old molded minifigures at the time, but to me at least he felt like he really needed a change in the early 2010s) and I also found his reddish brown color as an odd choice since the basic brown one had a more interesting color choice from lightning. Still, I&#39;m&nbsp;pretty sure he was put in to satisfy OT fanatics, while also bringing a character who was prevalent in TLJ. The minifigure is pretty good, specifically for his layer printing which has some nice color schemes. Chewie comes with his standard blaster.</p>

<h3>The build and playability&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This build has a nice rendition of the Episode VIII Millennium&nbsp;Falcon that is&nbsp;great as a small display and is easy to maneuver around for the kiddos to play around. As for play feature, the main play feature is, of course, to launch the stud shooters. These stud shooters also debuted in 2014 sets, which could launch studs in farther distances compared to the push missiles used back then. They give you four in this set in case if you lose some (because believe me, they DO shoot far). This is fun to play with, along with a little lever for the gate wite which could open. The only real problem I have with this set is the lever that opens up, which barely can be lowered up to the point it can be seen clearly at a distance.</p>

<h3>Now on to the pros and cons!</h3>

<p>Pros:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Great rendering of an iconic model of the franchise.</p>

<p>Nice Chewbacca&nbsp;minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fun play feature if not minded.</p>

<p>For those sticker haters, this set has no stickers included.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>The lever ramp has some problem of&nbsp;convincing that it works from a distance.</p>

<p>Really would be nice to have more pieces included.</p>

<h3>Overall final verdict&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This set made me go back to the LEGO Star Wars lane, where hopefully I can review&nbsp;more sets as soon as I get them, as this set is a nice little gift for a present. I&#39;d&nbsp;recommend this set to children who love Star Wars in general and let them get a Chewie figure in a cheap set. I think I&#39;d also recommend&nbsp;this set to people who are getting into LEGO as it has a simple build from an instantly recognizable vehicle. I think I&#39;d give this set a 8/10. If you want to buy it than go ahead, since I think right now it&#39;s still affordable for about $15 on Ebay at the most. Any opinions on the set and I&#39;ll try to respond as soon as possible.</p>
