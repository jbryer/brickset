"Green_Bricks","2019-09-22T16:06:05.403Z","'I only work in black. And sometimes glow in the dark, apparently.'","<p>I&#39;m writing this directly&nbsp;after reviewing set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/41588-1"">41588</a> The Joker, another set not yet reviewed by any users (although it seems that administrator <a href=""https://brickset.com/profile/CapnRex101"">CapnRex101</a>&nbsp;has written a review of both that set and this one, so if you want a trusted source for reviews, I&#39;d recommend his). Anyway, although this set is also one I&#39;m a fan of, I admittedly like his arch nemesis better.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p>Most BrickHeadz are extremely similar to each other from the legs up to the inside structure of the head, and although he has his utility belt jutting out of his belly, this one isn&#39;t much different to that rule. The most unique parts about this build were the cape, which looks the part but is difficult to see behind the figure itself, and the ears, which do look bat-like but are quite simple. Not really much else to say about this one.</p>

<p><strong>Completed model</strong></p>

<p>The reason I bought this figure in 2017, and I&#39;m sure the reason that most people bought this figure, was the complete look. The printed bat symbol looks great, and the character in general is extremely recognisable, but compared to other BrickHeadz he feels somewhat lacking. Black is unfortunately a quite boring colour, compared to <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/41588-1/The-Joker"">41588</a> The Joker&#39;s green hair and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/41586-1/Batgirl"">41586</a> Batgirl&#39;s&nbsp;vibrant purple and yellow. The main thing that really stands out about this model are the bizzare glow-in-the-dark eyes. They break the standard rule of BrickHeadz having the normal black printed eyes, and are most likely there to represent the character&#39;s nocturnal nature.</p>

<p><strong>The 3 Ps</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>P</strong>rice - (was) &pound;9.99, which was standard for the line but felt a bit steep for 91 average to small sized pieces, which could be purchased much cheaper second hand with the exception of printed elements</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong>layability - the BrickHeadz line is in no way focused on making functional models, and the only play value you could get out of this set is moving it around in your hands, similarly to a doll or other static toy</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong>arts - some nice printed elements,&nbsp;a few useful black&nbsp;tiles and of course 2 glow-in-the-dark round 1x1 tiles plus one spare, but nothing particularly special that would give it good part out value</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To sum up, the value in this model was for the recognisability of the character, not the model itself. Sure, it was popular upon release and looked good enough for what it was, and admittedly it would&#39;ve been hard for LEGO to make this figure very unique or special, but as a result it feels average. Still, I don&#39;t regret my purchase, considering that as a display piece it does what I wanted, so don&#39;t take the flaws listed above as too harsh or negative.&nbsp;I hope you found this somewhat useful, or at least enjoyed reading :)</p>

The eyes glow in the dark which is cool nd the cape looks good and so do the bat ears. The only things printed are the utility belt and the Batman logo on his torso. This is still a great Brickhead from when th line was just beginning. If you like Batman I would highly recommend picking this up.</p>
