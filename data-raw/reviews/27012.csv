The glasses are comically big just like in the movie and he has he hort shorts just like in the movie. They did a very good job with his hair and it looks just like it does on his minifigure. He only has the printed torso piece but that is okay. I would highly recommend this to anyone who liked the LEGO Batman Movie.</p>
