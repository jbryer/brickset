That being said, I&#39;m going to take it upon myself to review this now retired set, especially considering that if you want to complete your collection, you&#39;ll also want to know what you&#39;re getting in terms of quality.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p>As a BrickHeadz model, this set follows the basic formula from the legs up to the inside of the head, and will feel pretty similar to whatever else you&#39;ve built in this theme. The break from the formula in this set, however, is the very nicely executed green hair, a classic trait of this character that makes him extremely recognisable from a distance. The hair uses a wide variety of curved green bricks, which give it a nice natural look in contrast to the blocky character design, and make this section of the build the most enjoyable despite some repetition, mainly around the sides of the head.</p>

<p><strong>Completed model</strong></p>

<p>Obviously with these models, what you see is what you get. For a model that is going to spend it&#39;s life on a shelf, in my case next to set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/41585-1/Batman"">41585</a> Batman, all it needs to do is look good. Indeed, the printed bricks such as the tie look fabulous, and add life to what could very easily be a bland design. The mouth piece with red lipstick and a single tooth is suitably stylised, and the standard eyes help the model fit in with the others in the series, who all feature the same design. As part of the first major wave of these models, I think this one looks absolutely great.</p>

<p><strong>The 3 Ps</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>P</strong>rice - (was) &pound;9.99 rrp, which I think is fine for 151 pieces and a decently sized build, although in hindsight I definitely could&#39;ve waited and found it cheaper elsewhere</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong>layability - static model with no functionality, and one that is not designed as a toy. I guess you could hold the character and make him walk around, similarly to how you might with a doll, but this was never LEGO&#39;s intention when designing the model, especially considering you only get one character in this set</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong>arts - some interesting printed bricks and slopes, as mentioned earlier, but no BrickLinker&#39;s dream</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To sum up, as one of LEGO&#39;s first attempts, this was a good one, and I am certainly still happy with my purchase. However, today in 2019, we have better BrickHeadz and far more variety. Back in 2017 I would have recommended you to buy this in stores, but unless you&#39;re trying to complete your collection today or you&#39;re just a massive Batman fanatic, I&#39;d steer clear of this one on the second hand market. I hope you found this somewhat useful, or at least enjoyed reading :)</p>
