Well I&rsquo;m sure by now a lot of folks have reviewed to explain that, but here&rsquo;s my opinion anyway and hopefully it helps further the interest of these figures.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: Each box is character specific, depending on the Theme you&rsquo;ll find an image of the character it is meant to represent in-universe, which is a nice piece of artwork on the side and then the front showcases what their LEGO built version looks like. It&rsquo;s also designed to pop open easily making it easier to access, which isn&rsquo;t good should you come across open and pilfered samples on store shelves, but is still much appreciated as the boxes are quite nice looking and make good collector&rsquo;s items themselves.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: The manuals are thick folded in half types that make following along with the build difficult as they open from bottom to top rather than right to left, so getting them to stay open can be a bit of a nuisance. Still they work quite well once you&rsquo;ve dealt with the crease in the middle, and showcase all of the fun in building these models quite well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is a great parts pack, it&rsquo;s got a load of useful elements for MOC fans and in a nice cheap package. It also features some unique prints, mostly for the eyes and Black Widow&rsquo;s torso detailing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is pure SNOT building at its finest, a lot of very nice little design cues to give us a really beautiful looking display piece. I loved every step going forward as the figure came together and I&rsquo;m really looking forward to picking up some more of them.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Brickheadz are static pose buildable display figures in similar scale and design to FUNKO Pop figures, so the model in question truly works to capture that visual aesthetic while still being a buildable model, which is really quite nice. It&rsquo;s very blocky, a lot of cube and rectangular shapes here, the printed elements add to the detailing of an otherwise plain figure. A few studs are visible as part of her hair, I believe this was a conscious decision to enhance the figure with detailing that would otherwise not be possible.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;m extremely impressed with this figure. I bought it because it was retiring soon and I just felt that it would be the perfect first dive into the Brickheadz Theme. These models will not appeal to everybody, that being said I fully endorse this as a great looking set and one highly recommended to track down if you are a fan of this type of figure. Unlike FUNKO Pop you get to actually build the figure and then display it proudly with your collection, so there&rsquo;s more to offer from this than the FUNKO toys.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Collect them all or pick and choose your favorites, but try them, you might be pleasantly surprised by the fun to be had with these figures. Highly recommended.</p>
