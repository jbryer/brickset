<p><br />
THE BOX AND INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
The box is fairly small and cube shaped. The front displays the Brickheadz Iron Man and the side shows the &#39;real&#39; Iron Man.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/68uqsazo3/image.jpg"" style=""width: 650px; height: 487px;"" /></p>

<p>The back has all the Marvel Brickheadz shown, along with a picture of Iron Man being put on his display stand.</p>

<p>The instructions are a funny shape, with the picture of Iron Man on the cover being vertical and the actual instructions being horizontal but other than that they&#39;re pretty standard.</p>

<p><br />
THE PARTS</p>

<p><br />
If you want buttery-yellow and dark red parts, then this is the set for you. Dark red tiles, dark red 1x1 bricks, dark red headlight bricks, buttery-yellow tiles, buttery-yellow bricks...well, you get the point. There&#39;s also six printed pieces, three of which are exclusive plus some random green and pink stuff for inside the head. And of course you get a bunch of Brick 1X2X1 2/3 W/4 Knobs to make the head.</p>

<p>THE BUILD</p>

<p><br />
Being a small set, the build is quick but fun. Lots of studs-on-the-side construction that is clever but easy enough for small kids to follow.</p>

<p>THE COMPLETED MODEL</p>

<p><br />
I&#39;m just gonna go right ahead and get my two&nbsp;nitpicks out of the way: #1: the &#39;ear&#39; bits tend to move around easily since they&#39;re only attached by one stud.&nbsp;That can get annoying if you aren&#39;t careful. #2: at least two of the 2x2 red tiles seem to be slightly discolored. I&#39;ve seen three different of these sets built and they all have the same problem.</p>

<p>Now I can proceed to the positive gushing bit.</p>

<p>In my opinion, Brickheadz is an excellent idea: Funko Pop styled Lego characters for ten bucks. I mean, you can&#39;t get much better than that. When the Comic Con Iron Man and Captain America were revealed, I was mad that they wouldn&#39;t be readily available...but then Lego released an even better Iron Man in a &#39;normal&#39; set! I am a happy Lego fan. Iron Man is everything a good Brickhead (or should I still say Brickheadz? Or is that the plural? Now I&#39;m confused) should be: recognizable, but with that cute blocky shape. Cleverly built, but using nice new printed parts to the best effect. I like Lego&#39;s choice of darker yellow and dark red instead of the brighter colors used by the Comic Con version. He&#39;s also super sturdy! The stand is a nice addition despite the fact that it&#39;s a tad too small. Iron Man looks great from all angles.</p>

<p>There&#39;s no &quot;camera unfriendly angle&quot; as Jangbricks would say. The worst view is from the back and that&#39;s only because it&#39;s rather plain there. Ok, ok, I won&#39;t gush anymore. Moving along.</p>

<p><br />
OVERALL</p>

<p><br />
Overall!? OVERALL!?!? I was pretty sure I made my thoughts on this set clear. But hold on a second...what&#39;s this?? People are complaing about lack of articulation? They say that Brickheadz are nothing but display models? Fah! Who needs articulation! Plus you can move the hands from pointing down to pointing forward or backward (well, you do have to remove the arms and reposition them the way you want them, but that&#39;s besides the point). Doesn&#39;t that count as articulation? And as for being display models!!...well, yes they are chiefly display models but just lock your bedroom door and let your inner child out: fly Iron Man around the room! Make him fight other Brickheadz! (even though his fists don&#39;t quite make it past his torso). Make him walk around! I mean, come on. If you hand this guy to a kid, they&#39;re not going to look at it and complain about lack of articulation. They&#39;re gonna do all the things I just listed. Plus, he looks great as a display model! There, any uncertainty about my opinions on Brickheadz has been obliterated. Brickheadz rock!</p>

Side note: you could probably make a decent Tony Stark face using the mustache from 41593 Jack Sparrow. Just a thought.</p>

There is good detail in the legs and it carries throughout the build. The eyes have a white print on a light transparent blue 1x1 tile and I have never seen that done before. Overall this is a very good detailed build that I would highly recommend for anyone who likes the Marvel movies.</p>
