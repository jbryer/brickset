The torso some easy, lazy prints, and he has bigger arms that look too short and they can bend a little. His face is bland and the hair looks like they started placing 1x1 cheese slopes in random patterns to make his hair. This is one of the lower quality brickheadz and it resembles the look of the Incredible Hulk movie from 2008, yea its that bad looking. It makes me want to Hulk Smash this thing into the ground. I would only possibly recommend this to people who are major fans of Hulk, that is if you want them to stop being Hulk fans cause after they see this they won&#39;t want to be.</p>

<p>Comes in a small box. The dimensions of the&nbsp;box are 3.6 x 4.8 x 3.1 inches and weighs 0.25 pounds. Comes with a small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>There aren&#39;t really any cool or unique parts with this brickheadz. You get 5&nbsp;printed pieces: Eyes x2,&nbsp;two&nbsp;1x4 green bricks with abs and pecs on it, and the 2x4 tile on the brickheadz stand. The green and few purple pieces were nice to get as well. The total piece count is 93.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy took around 5 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is my least favorite brickheadz I own (I own 5 including this one: Darth Vader, Young Han Solo, Chewbacca, Captain Jack Sparrow, and Captain Armando Salazar). This is still a good brickheadz. It is unique with the arms are larger than the normal brickheadz. The detail isn&#39;t great but not bad. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 3-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
