<p>In my opinion, whether you like the Brickheadz&nbsp;series is almost completely dependent on personal taste. They have a particular style, that you tend to either like or dislike strongly. Even though I appreciate the skill of&nbsp;the designers, the vast majority of the Brickheadz&nbsp;series did not appeal to me at all. Belle and the Beast (and Jack Sparrow) were the only ones I liked.</p>

<p>When I needed a little filler to get over the free shipping and free gift limit I was looking for something small; the Belle and the Beast Brickheadz&nbsp;fit the bill nicely.</p>

<p>The build was actually more fun than I had expected at first. The construction of the core of the figure is not that interesting at all, but it is nice to see how the designer has built up the details to give the figure its looks. For Belle that is above all her hair.&nbsp;Personally I like the fact that the dress reaches down all the way to the bottom, and the rose in her right hand is a nice detail.</p>

<p>Overall, I would say Belle offers nice value for money, and if you look for a nice set of statuettes as alternative room decoration, Belle and the Beast are a very nice option. The one lasting effect Belle has had upon me is that I am now more open to buying Brickheadz in the future.</p>

<p>If you are new to this series, it is a nice start to a collection or does well as a stand-alone, or rather a stand-a-pair with Beast. If you collect the series, than personally these would be very high on the list for me.&nbsp;</p>
