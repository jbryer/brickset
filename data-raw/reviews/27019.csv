<p>In my opinion, whether you like the Brickheadz&nbsp;series is almost completely dependent on personal taste. They have a particular style, that you tend to either like or dislike strongly. Even though I appreciate the skill of&nbsp;the designers, the vast majority of the Brickheadz&nbsp;series did not appeal to me at all. Belle and the Beast (and Jack Sparrow) were the only ones I liked.</p>

<p>When I needed a little filler to get over the free shipping and free gift limit I was looking for something small; the Belle and the Beast Brickheadz&nbsp;fit the bill nicely.</p>

<p>The build was actually more fun than I had expected at first. The construction of the core of the figure is not that interesting at all, but it is nice to see how the designer has built up the details to give the figure its looks. Where for Belle it is mostly her hair, for Beast it actually is his whole head, and his face in particular. The figure as a while resembles the Disney character nicely. His face has some expression, IMHO a rather sad one - missing Belle. The design of his hair (including ponytail), tail, and suit is simple but effective. If there is one negative, it would be the legs feet (but that is a result of the design constraints of Brickheadz&nbsp;most of all).</p>

<p>Overall, I would say Beast, just as Belle&nbsp;offers nice value for money, and if you look for a nice set of statuettes as alternative room decoration, Belle and the Beast are a very nice option. The one lasting effect the Beast (with&nbsp;Belle) has had upon me is that I am now more open to buying Brickheadz in the future.</p>

<p>If you are new to this series, it is a nice start to a collection or does well as a stand-alone, or rather a stand-a-pair with Beast. If you collect the series, than personally these would be very high on the list for me.&nbsp;</p>

"Dude45","2018-05-05T16:35:46.04Z","Nice representation of Beast, but unacceptable color variations","<p>I don&#39;t like BrickHeadz, but I gave this one a go after it was discounted 50%.</p>

<p>The fundamental problem with BrickHeadz is the playability, which is zero. BrickHeadz builds are only useful for display purposes, and the build experience itself. In that sense I think the predecessor Mixels was a better theme.</p>

<p>Beast is instantly recognizable and the designer has done a great job at representing his head and costume. The tooth pieces work out very nicely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Something I don&#39;t like is the unacceptable color-variations among pieces. Several of Beast&#39;s sloping 2x2 hair pieces have distinctively different colors, although this of course is not supposed to be the case. LEGO obviously needs to improve its quality control.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-11-07T12:29:16.467Z","Cursed Lord of the Castle","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #41596 Beast:</b> Released to coincide with the live action remake of Beauty and the Beast this is one of four Disney inspired BrickHeadz released in the same assortment. This is a very imaginative looking model and is very iconic looking in certain respects, the use of parts is very well done.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: This box is a deep pink/rose in colour to harken to the magical rose that cursed Beast and his Castle. Despite being meant to be a release for the live action remake the character artwork on the side is the more iconic looking animation model, which is a good idea as the live action version was rather controversial.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: The same concerns are here for the manual design as with other BrickHeadz sets. They still work well though despite some of the flaws in the manual design for such smaller sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with other BrickHeadz sets the parts included in this set are very unique and interesting and each box is perfect for a Parts Pack. Printed elements include eyes, central torso tile and the printed tiles early BrickHeadz featured with the Number 1 on the stand.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The build is extremely similar in the central torso to other BrickHeadz, but as with every set, we find there are a lot of details specific to the character as we build outward and upward with the heads. This build is very satisfying and fun and a quick little build for whenever you feel like making something fast for convention or family night contests. Who can build their BrickHeadz the fastest? Have a friendly family contest and find out.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Beast looks great, his detailing is replicated very well with this model and it looks really impressive. He does not get anything to hold for an accessory as Belle is holding the rose, it might have been nice to see the magic mirror in his hand built up out of additional elements so he&rsquo;d have something to hold and display with, but it&rsquo;s not a deal breaker. The use of parts is very well thought out for making his facial features and unique hair covered design, and he even includes a tail.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is another set I strongly recommend as a display piece or for Parts Pack hunters, I am really impressed with the BrickHeadz line as a whole, but feel that going after them on the secondary market is a bit difficult. Still if you really like the aesthetics you definitely should collect these fun and enjoyable little sets. It won&rsquo;t be everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea though and I understand that. Strongly recommended.</p>

<p>There is no playability, as it&#39;s for display. It was an ok&nbsp;building experience, but feels like something is missing from it. The parts are ok such as the ones used for Beast&#39;s torso. The value is ok as it does look good with other Disney Lego sets. However, the pieces used for the hair on the front of Beast&#39;s face fall off easily.</p>
