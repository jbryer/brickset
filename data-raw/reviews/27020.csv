<p>A&nbsp;polybag&nbsp;is never going to be much of a parts pack and this is no exception, containing&nbsp;only&nbsp;8 different&nbsp;elements&nbsp;- though it does mean that what it lacks in variety it makes up for in the&nbsp;quantities of those included, especially if you&#39;re after medium&nbsp;azur&nbsp;1x2 and&nbsp;1x4 tiles.&nbsp;Only the&nbsp;4x10&nbsp;plates in Bright&nbsp;Yellowish Green are rare at time of writing, appearing in two other sets - a&nbsp;relatively generous three are included here. All of the&nbsp;parts themselves are common and this set can easily be reproduced in a range of alternative&nbsp;colours. The build itself could be completed from a picture of the finished model by most above the 6+ guidance age on the packet.</p>

<p>Though there&nbsp;are no&nbsp;minfigs&nbsp;or&nbsp;minidolls&nbsp;here,&nbsp;the two sides locked&nbsp;in&nbsp;battle for&nbsp;tic-tac-toe&nbsp;supremacy wield the next best thing to represent the violent cut and thrust of the game - either a ravaging wrack&nbsp;of baby rabbits, or a howling&nbsp;horde&nbsp;of hamsters. Both have only&nbsp;appeared in a handful of other sets and&nbsp;are equally cute,&nbsp;despite the holes in their heads which I assume is for accessories but looks a bit strange when bare -&nbsp;if&nbsp;nothing else, it&#39;s an ideal jumping off point for an educational lecture on&nbsp;trepanning&nbsp;when my daughter is old enough...&nbsp;For those&nbsp;thinking of putting together a pet shop&nbsp;MOC (or completely overrunning the&nbsp;slightly cramped #10218) this is a must-buy&nbsp;as five of each are supplied. The Friends design team certainly know their target audience as my daughter was entranced by both equally and as such, they frequently&nbsp;find their way into other sets around the house. This means that they often&nbsp;have to be retrieved from wherever she has decided they should take up residence most recently - playing Where&#39;s Wally/Waldo with them in&nbsp;the Temple of&nbsp;Airjitzu, or worse, the Death Star, is a necessary prelude to any game being able to take place.</p>

<p>Despite maybe a touch of male&nbsp;AFOL&nbsp;cynicism about the unsubtle cuteness brought by being part of&nbsp;the Friends theme, after a few games I was completely won over.&nbsp;The&nbsp;colours&nbsp;are bold but not unpleasant, and the animal playing pieces are&nbsp;tactile and, yes, fairly adorable. Simple and the exact opposite of earth shatteringly innovative&nbsp;in build and execution, it engenders everything great about the original &#39;game&#39; (if you can even call it that!)&nbsp;and has&nbsp;nonetheless&nbsp;provided&nbsp;a surprising amount&nbsp;of entertainment in our household -&nbsp;like all the best Lego sets, the end result is more than just the sum of its parts.</p>
