It is actually quite impressive that this theme has been semi-retired twice now and still keeps rising to prominence as LEGO fans are born every generation. As far as this set for LEGO Dimensions goes, I believe this may be the one time I have a negative feeling about a set because it offers up nothing in-game for anything. It&rsquo;s basically just a glorified character pack for the game, so you can include Hermione in LEGO Dimensions. Which is a shame really. But we&rsquo;re getting ahead of ourselves. Let&rsquo;s discuss the set as a whole before going over final thoughts.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Packaging</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Hermione and Buckbeak are prominent on the front of the box as with all of the LEGO Dimensions packages. I&rsquo;m definitely having a load of fatigue issues here in discussing the packaging, while I have praised the uniform nature of the packages from LEGO Dimensions I feel that I&rsquo;ve said as much as I can. And yet I continue to include this portion in the reviews out of a stubborn need to keep things consistent. Sometimes I hate OCD compulsions.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Ahem, that being said. Great package design, shows everything you need to and attracted the eye on store shelves when stores actually sold these products. LEGO Dimensions has been out of stores for a while now and it has taken me this long to get all of my reviews typed up for them. Goodness but this went on a tad too long.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Parts</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">There is nothing uniquely printed in this set aside from the toy tag for Hermione. No fun tile prints, no interesting parts or unique design choices. It&rsquo;s your standard pack of LEGO Dimensions parts which in most cases is the equivalent of a 5$ Polybag set. The Legends of Chima wing elements are included here in a nice dark gray colour, so there is that to mention.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minifigures</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Hermione Granger: This version of Hermione is uniquely designed to re-capture Prisoner of Azkaban punch Draco out Hermione and it is stunning. Now granted this was before they introduced the new wand element, so her wand is a big brown rod instead of the new sculpted piece, but if you wanted to you could supply a spare from your many Hermione Minifigures. She also doesn&rsquo;t include the more accurate hair style piece, but this was before Wizarding World re-emerged fully as a Theme and so these issues can be forgiven.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">What is here is a very nice rendition of Hermione and a huge draw towards the fun of this set. A solid looking version of Hermione from Prisoner of Azkaban.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The build</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Buckbeak: This model is pretty decent as far as builds go, it&rsquo;s no unique animal sculpt part, but it does a fairly decent job of making a Hippogriff. It also captures the digital likeness quite well, though some of the parts colour choice doesn&rsquo;t quite match up. I had fun building it though.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Giant Owl: This second model is another flying creature, which makes sense since the wing elements can&rsquo;t be used for much of anything else, unless you want to build a statue of some sort. That being said this build is fairly creative, you get to build a perch for the model on top of the toy tag before we move on to constructing the owl itself, which is an awesome looking model. Enjoyed this build.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Fierce Falcon: In contrast this model makes a different type of bird and it just sucks, I mean it works, but this model is awkwardly proportioned as you build it, the wings look pitifully undersized and the construction has you building the Falcon in mid-lunge, which is a terrible idea. No fun when I built this model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Buckbeak &amp; Alternate Builds: All three of these models use the same parts, which means Buckbeak has tan forelegs, which doesn&rsquo;t look right because the digital model seems to be a darker grey colour for those parts matching up with the colour of the wings and rear legs.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">As I noted in the build section though both Buckbeak and the Giant Owl are really fun models, once finished you can safely see yourself playing with these physical toys quite well. The Fierce Falcon however just looks stupid, because they used the molded wing elements from before and then tried to have you build wings on top of those, which gives a hunchback bird looking appearance to the model as it dives in to attack its prey. I am just not a fan of this third model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The Digital Content</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Adventure World: You once again unlock the Wizarding World, specifically Hogwarts Castle and surrounding environs in the Harry Potter world. If you read my review on the Team Pack you&rsquo;ll know how well I enjoy this world, but quite frankly you don&rsquo;t need this pack to unlock it because the Team Pack from much earlier would be what a lot of people bought on day one, so Hermione&rsquo;s pack is rather superfluous.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Battle Arena: Hermione unlocks the Hogwarts Quidditch Arena, this is the exact same Battle Arena the Team Pack unlocked except this one is set during the day while Harry&rsquo;s was set during the night. See why this pack is so unneeded? You aren&rsquo;t getting any really new content here aside from the characters, which is extremely disappointing. At least give us a Forbidden Forest Battle Arena or something, re-using assets was just a way to save money though and digital disc space.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Character &amp; Vehicle Abilities: Hermione features many familiar abilities. She has Water Spray, Laser Deflector, Diffindo, Illumination, Magic, Intelligence puzzles, Acrobat, Apparate Access and can Destroy Silver LEGO Objects. Most of these abilities are not unique to her, in fact all of them are not unique to her, so really she doesn&rsquo;t bring anything new to the table as Raven and the Powerpuff Girls did in this same wave.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Buckbeak has the Guardian Ability is a Flying creature and can destroy Cracked LEGO Objects and Silver LEGO Objects. Rebuilt into the Giant Owl you can Fly still and now can access Electricity Switches. Which is a rather curious ability for an Owl to access. The Fierce Falcon has Sonar Smash and acts as a Special Weapon as well as Flying. Naturally all three creatures with wings would fly.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The physical toys are more interesting than the digital content with this LEGO Dimensions set, so pick it up cheap if you&rsquo;d prefer to own Hermione in this outfit. I don&rsquo;t think the newer sets have re-used that torso print yet. Honestly this was a bit of a slog to get through, this set doesn&rsquo;t even have a truly unique Battle Arena to enjoy for the multiplayer. The team behind LEGO Dimensions was really getting lazy with this final wave, I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this unless you&rsquo;re a fan of the character. Half-Heartedly Recommended for Fans.</span></span></span></span></p>
