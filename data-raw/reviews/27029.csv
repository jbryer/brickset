<p>its an excellent&nbsp;little set. A micro set of the ghost that in a simple and brilliant way represents what it is.</p>

<p>between the wedges plates 2x2 in white and the inverted round slopes 1x2 in light bluish grey, there is a great selection of parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also the build is easy and quick, yet simple enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons: the engines in the back are loose and easily fall off. But honestly cant seamed&nbsp;to find a way to do them better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros: its a very good build. a little and funny ship that just asks for a little diorama around it. which i already gave it. Also very swooshable and playful.</p>

<p>A very good set indeed. Also with a very good part\price ratio, with 50 pieces and the price of 3.99 Euros. very good indeed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
