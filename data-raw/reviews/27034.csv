"J14T14","2018-10-26T15:09:24.98Z","My First Brickhead","<p>This was the first LEGO Brickheadz&nbsp;set and it introduced me into the line. I missed out on all the early Pirates of the Caribbean sets so I really wanted to have a LEGO representation of the main character of the movies, Jack Sparrow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set had a very&nbsp;interesting build ad the head was unlike any LEGO set that I had before. The hair was fairly detailed and I like how they managed to capture his beard&nbsp;braids. The 1x2 printed plate on his hip is also nice and I think that it is the closest&nbsp;that we are ever going to get to having an official LEGO bacon piece. The 2x2 printed tile on the base is&nbsp;also nice, though since they did not print the actual brickheadz&nbsp;number on the plate and instead put down what wave it belonged to, I am glad that they do not appear on later sets. I also like the use of the 1x1 dark gray plated underneath&nbsp;the 1x1 round printed eyes to dive the eye shadow affect that is present on the character in the movies.</p>

<p>Overall, this was a really great first brickhead. It&#39;s look isn&#39;t too specific to any one movie and it looks great on display. I highly recommend&nbsp;this to anyone who loves the movies and wants a fun cartoony version of their favorite pirate.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-07T22:50:02.913Z","Thats got to be the best pirate I've ever seen","<p>They recreated the look of the swashbuckling Pirate Captain Jack Sparrow amazingly. The prints on this are awesome and he is such an iconic character and they really did him justice with this set. He is instantly recognizable if this is on your shelf. He just looks so good for being one of the early brickheadz to be released. I would highly recommend this to anyone who got even a little laugh out of the Pirates Of The Caribbean movies.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-11-07T12:28:11.807Z","Loveable Scoundrel of the Seas","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #41593 Captain Jack Sparrow:</b> Well matey, it would appear that LEGO Pirates of the Carribean has ended with a bang. The Silent Mary was the piece-de-resistance, but two BrickHeadz were also made available, the main villain which was covered in a recent review and the fan favorite Captain Jack.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: The packaging for this set is just as impressive as Captain Salazar&rsquo;s, it looks very nice with the rich dark blue colour and the shot of Jack on the side as the actor looks extremely impressive when compared to the actual model&hellip; That being said the model still stands out very well on the front of the box.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: Again you&rsquo;re going to find creased and folded manuals in these BrickHeadz sets, which leads to a problem when you want to just open the instructions and follow along with them to build the model, because you&rsquo;ll be fighting to keep it open on the correct page as you build your model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There are a few printed tiles and other elements for Jack&rsquo;s outfit and face while the rest is built up with bricks so you&rsquo;ll find a load of 1x2 bricks with side studs and of course you get a pirate cutlass. As always a great parts pack at a great price.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with all BrickHeadz I am consistently impressed with the builds of these models. Jack has a very nice looking model as you work to build him up, what&rsquo;s interesting is how they make his hair. Much like with Salazar they do a very impressive job to build up the large head of hair Jack has with the braids and things, seeing it in a flat block-based environment is a bit off. But the build is fairly fun and interesting.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Jack looks great, he&rsquo;s not wearing his trademark coat or hat, this model is built as him with his under outfit which is just as iconic as the full outfit, but perhaps the BrickHead would have looked better with the full ensemble and stand out as being a tad more unique. It&rsquo;s interesting to note that the stand seems to be using a smaller 4x6 base instead of the more common 6x6 stands. If you put his printed tile on upside down you&rsquo;ll be stuck without a proper moustache, but a fun looking smile.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I really like the BrickHeadz theme so I recommend them to folks who, like me, enjoy building these engaging little models. Folks could probably skip these unless they want the parts for a MOC of some kind. So I recommend the set for fans of the Theme or folks looking for cheap parts packs. Something I haven&rsquo;t noted before is that these sets do include a pair of pink bricks in most of the sets as part of the central core of the model. Recommended.</p>

"vikings","2020-05-24T04:01:14.233Z","Captain Jack Sparrow","<p><strong>Box/Instruction:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a small box. The dimensions of the box are 3.6 x 4.8 x 3.1 inches and weighs around 0.26 pounds. Comes with a small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You don&#39;t get any really cool or unique parts. The set comes with 7&nbsp;printed parts which are: 2x4 tile on the stand, eye x2, 1x4 brick with belt printing, 1x2 brick with white shirt collar printing, 1x4 tan tile with a moustache, and a 1x2 tile with maroon wavy&nbsp;lines on it. You get a pirate sword as his accessory. Getting some of maroon pieces was also nice. The total piece count is 109.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy took me less than 10 minutes to build. The new design used for his hair is great with his maroon band going all the way around his head, interweaving in and out of his hair. Just a great design style for this brickheadz.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great brickheadz and recommend adding it to your lego collection. The detail on him is amazing. The use of different colors and parts to design his hair is outstanding. The maroon going around his head captures part of his iconic look. The face and printing for his body is very well done. I highly recommend getting if you are a fan of brickheadz or of Pirates of the Caribbean, or just to add to your Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Main Build</h2>

<p>Since there are no minifigures we&#39;ll go ahead and start with the main build. He has the usual Brickheadz base structure which is just a bunch of tiles and slopes added to the main structure. His torso has a printed 1x3 brick which shows his belt, along with a 1x2 brick with printing that show his undershirt. There&#39;s also a 1x2 tile that I think is suppose&nbsp;to be excess belt or shirt that&#39;s dangling down. His face has a 1x4 tile which shows his moustache, and he has the usual 1x1 round tiles for eyes which are on 1x1 plates in dark gray to represent lack of sleep. On his forehead there are two 2x2x2 slope tiles in dark red, which is suppose to be his bandanna. The rest of his head has a conglomeration of different black plates and tiles, to represent his messy hair.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Packaging &amp; Instructions</h2>

<p>The box is the usual Brickheadz box, which is taller than usual and has the set on the front, and a picture of Captain Jack Sparrow on the side. The instructions are the small $10 instruction size.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is one of the better Brickheadz and would recommend purchasing it either because it&#39;s Jack Sparrow, if you&#39;re a fan of Pirates of the Caribbean, or if you&#39;re a Brickheadz completionist.</p>
