"StarKiller22515","2019-12-07T22:45:46.74Z","For the fans of Pirates of the Caribbean","<p>The buttons on the font have this print of silver so that it reflects light, which is really cool. The back of his head is split open so that you can see his brain which really gives off the undead vibe. and the cuff of his sleeve was a nice touch. The cracks on the front of his head are printed and so is his torso. Overall he was a pretty bland villain in the movie but he looks pretty cool as a Brickhead. I would recommend this only to those who have seen the movie and are big fans of Pirates of the Caribbean films.</p>

<p>Comes in a small box. The dimensions of the box are 3.6 x. 4.8 x 3.1 inches and weighs 0.27 pounds. Comes with a small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You don&#39;t have any cool or unique parts in this set. You do get 7 printed pieces which are: 2x4 white tile with black lines on his forehead, eyes x2, silver buttons x2, 2x4 black tile on the stand, and the brick with his uniform printing on it. You also get a pirate sword as an accessory for it as well. The total piece count for the set is 118.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy took me around 5 minutes to build it. The build was different from the traditional brickheadz, in which part of the back left side of the head is exposed showing his brain. I really like this because it gives a nice undead feeling to this brickheadz.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice brickheadz. The new design on the back of his head exposing his brain is really cool. The way the hair looks is also well done. The buttons and cuffs add nice detail to the brickheadz. This is a great brickheadz (Especially if you have seen the movie). I do recommend this if you have seen the movie. It is still a good brickheadz even if you haven&#39;t (but helps to have seen the movie). Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-11-07T12:26:19.367Z","Cursed Captain of the Depths","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #41594 Captain Armando Salazar:</b> Welcome once again to the world of LEGO BrickHeadz. A world in which your favorite, and perhaps not so favorite, characters come to life as tiny buildable brick models. For two years LEGO made many of these things available from many separate Themes featuring a wide range of characters. Now, in 2019, it would appear that the popularity and designers are waning away from these sets which is a huge shame. For fans&hellip; Others probably felt that it was about time for this quirky little Theme to vanish. I am firmly in the camp who feels a bit sad to see them reduced and on their way out, the build techniques and character choices may not appeal to everybody, but they are some of the best small sets LEGO has done in a long while.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: The packaging design is uniform across all of the many different Sub-Themes created for BrickHeadz. This Disney inspired character has a dark blue box with the traditional image of the character as he appears on film on one side and the rest shows off the amazing BrickHeadz model with cross promotional images for the rest of the four Disney inspired characters from this wave.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: As I noted previously with Black Widow these manuals are slightly harder to follow along with because they are somewhat tricky to get to stay open. Short of using a very low setting on your parents iron (supervised of course) to remove the crease in the folded booklet so you can keep it open easier there&rsquo;s very little that can be done to correct this design problem. The build steps themselves are still easily followed along with and not too difficult to keep track of in spite of the folded booklet wanting to close on you whenever you put it down to build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As every BrickHeadz is unique every set has different elements. Captain Salazar includes a lot of white, black and grey elements to reflect his undead nature and there are some unique printed elements to him including a pair of buttons for his large overcoat. Every BrickHeadz set is an awesome parts pack for builders, the 1x2 tall bricks with studs on the side are of particular interest for folks who prefer SNOT building techniques.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Captain Salazar&rsquo;s build is as equally impressive as Black Widow&rsquo;s was, even more so as you are building an undead zombie pirate who has certain areas of the body which have rotted away and vanished so there are certain areas in the model which feature less elements to simulate these &lsquo;holes&rsquo; in the torso and head. Every aspect of this models build is unique and fun despite sharing basic cues which other BrickHeadz use in their builds. It&rsquo;s truly a satisfying and quick build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Captain Salazar has an awful lot of interesting design cues, from his wild looking hair do and his impressively detailed coat this BrickHeadz model really captures the likeness of the character if not the actor portraying him. His BrickHeadz model gets to hold a Pirate sword element in one hand and includes some scar detailing on printed tiles to show his undead nature. Overall the model looks great when on display next to other BrickHeadz sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As I noted in my previous review these sets will not be for everybody. A lot of people will more than likely skip over this Theme or use them for cheap basic parts packs for their MOC designs. In my opinion if these sets appeal to you then tracking down your favorite characters and adding them to your collection is not a bad idea. I&rsquo;d strongly recommend many of them for that reason alone, but be aware that these sets have retired and being such good parts packs are not exactly easy to come by in the secondary market for cheap prices. Be prepared to pay over the original retail price at least twice over if you&rsquo;re looking to collect these after the fact. Strongly Recommended.</p>

<p>There is no playability as Brickheads are mostly for display. Parts are ok and the build for his hair is done better than I thought it would.&nbsp;Building experience was meh as the build is a bit bland, but the exposed back side is cool. The value is ok for the &quot;Brickheads&quot; theme, but is probably better enjoyed by POTC fans.&nbsp;</p>
