"Greenjedi77","2018-01-07T20:29:02.29Z","All it needed was donuts......","<p>Lego City Undercover is my favorite game produced by Lego-besides Lego Dimensions- and this was a great way to experience Lego City anew. this fun pack features a new Chase McCain minifigure&nbsp;with his grapple gun from the original game. The pack also includes a police helicopter so Chase can fly around Lego City. Chase has the ability to use his detective scanner for tracking. He also has acrobatics and the grapple ability of course. He also has four other suits to choose from. With the miner suit, he has silver&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;blowup and cracked Lego&nbsp;objects. With the fireman suit he has a&nbsp;water beam from his fire extinguisher. With the astronaut suit he can fly, use targeting, and use teleportation pads. With the farmer suit he can use targeting and glide with his chicken. Finally, with his construction worker outfit he can use his jackhammer but for whatever reason cannot fix broken objects.&nbsp;</p>

This entire Fun Pack is used to unlock the LEGO City game universe in LEGO Dimensions, so if you haven&rsquo;t played that game yet you&rsquo;ll wind up a little lost on the storyline info, but that&rsquo;s a minor complaint.</span></span></span></span></p>

Well this Minifigure is pretty awesome if you collect LEGO City, but honestly it is just a standard LEGO Police Officer with hair instead of a cap or motorcycle helmet, but that&rsquo;s the entire point. No unique parts for him, he uses the &lsquo;mega phone&rsquo; element with a hook element to make a grapple gun for him as an accessory. Chase has the unique distinction of being the only Yellow Minifigure released in Dimensions Series 2. Every single other character was from a licensed property.</span></span></span></span></p>

This build is pretty creative with the small selection of parts found in the set and stands out because of it.</span></span></span></span></p>

The only thing I enjoy about them are the unique way they&rsquo;ve designed the three models. With these limited number of pieces these models are interesting, they look great and the printed elements typical of LEGO City Police sets help enhance the overall appearance of them.</span></span></span></span></p>

I feel the puzzles and quests in this world require a lot of knowledge of the other game to appreciate them more, but mostly with this one I didn&rsquo;t find any glitches or issues while playing through it.</span></span></span></span></p>

The reason why Chase can do all this is because he comes with unique costumes that allow him to assume these different abilities. Chase can become a Firefighter, Construction Worker, Spaceman and one or two other costumes I&rsquo;ve forgotten.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Hovercraft can Destroy Gold LEGO Objects, use Accelerator Switches and Super Jump as well as Tow Bar. The Police Plane can do almost everything that the Helicopter can, but instead of using Tow Bars it can use Drone Mazes.</span></span></span></span></p>

Even Ninjago has more unique ideas due to the source material, there isn&rsquo;t much you can do with LEGO City as a Theme, so it&rsquo;s nice to at least see this set working as a decent way to get a Chase McCain Minifigure. Slightly Recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
