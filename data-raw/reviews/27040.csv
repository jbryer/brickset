It&rsquo;s another Steven Spielberg staple of the 1980&rsquo;s joining the world of LEGO Dimensions, now you can have Marty McFly interact with The Goonies, E.T. and Gizmo from Gremlins. I honestly wish LEGO Dimensions had lasted a bit longer so we could get a Jaws pack, maybe even Indiana Jones as well if Disney would have allowed it. Ah well, on to discussing the pack.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Sloth is the main character on the front of this pack with some nice action shots of iconic areas seen in the movie, the Pirate ship, the Captain&rsquo;s Cabin and that spooky looking skull rock where the water slide was found&hellip; if memory serves. The back shows some nice artwork of the Adventure World and of course all six of the various models you can make in this set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">A nice selection of parts for the models here with some nice spiky elements commonly used for LEGO buildable creature teeth, and a lot of brown elements for the ship. There&rsquo;s also a few skeleton limbs and that in the set. Overall some nice use of parts.</span></span></span></span></p>

Decent looking figure and a must have character for fans of the franchise.</span></span></span></span></p>

Everyone will have a load of fun constructing this model, there is nothing too tricky or frustrating for such a small model, and no stickers to worry about because it is LEGO Dimensions.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Skeleton Jukebox: Re-using the parts above you can build this secondary model and it looks pretty stellar once finished, the build isn&rsquo;t too different from the organ in certain steps due to the re-use of parts, but overall still a fun build.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Skele-Turkey: I have no idea what this model is meant to evoke as it&rsquo;s certainly not seen in the source material, but it&rsquo;s a quirky looking third model with some nice ideas in the design, the build is fast and simple and nothing to really worry about.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">One-Eyed Willy&rsquo;s Pirate Ship: Miniature models at this scale are always a treat and this build is highly impressive. I loved it from start to finish and once completed the model just looks great.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Fanged Fortune: This is a rather awkward looking final product, but the build is simple and easy to follow along with. Nothing truly terrible.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Inferno Cannon: A hodgepodge of parts tossed together to vaguely make something else. It isn&rsquo;t a terrible build, but it is pretty weak and not very fun.</span></span></span></span></p>

Really great trio of models.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">One-Eyed Willy&rsquo;s Pirate Ship &amp; Alternate Models: Just stick with the pirate ship, both alternate models are terribly disappointing in my opinion and after seeing such an impressively designed micro-scaled pirate ship the other models are just there to pad out the content. It might have been better to implement something else because the Fanged Fortune and The Inferno Cannon are just terrible ideas for alt builds.</span></span></span></span></p>

I think there&rsquo;s a different title for it on the packaging, but it isn&rsquo;t always the same between what is shown in-game and what is written up on the package.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Loads of puzzles and adventures to play alongside, also there wasn&rsquo;t any glitches or problems I ran into while playing through the game. A pretty decent nostalgic trip with some great voice work.</span></span></span></span></p>

Really great place and again no glitches or problems to speak of while exploring and unlocking all the collectibles or events.</span></span></span></span></p>

He also has the unique ability to us Goonies Change which allows you to swap between the other characters from the movie. I don&rsquo;t believe they have unique abilities of their own, but I seem to recall that one or both of the girls can use Sonar Smash when they scream. The game does not list what other abilities might be unlocked with The Goonies.</span></span></span></span></p>

I&rsquo;d say this is a Pack you must get, mostly for the music and the other elements of the classic film The Goonies which you get to experience in LEGO form here. Loved every moment of this pack and while some of the builds are way too annoying, I&rsquo;d still recommend the set for the Digital content alone. Highly Recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
