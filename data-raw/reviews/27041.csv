<p>The cardboard backdrop isn&#39;t that great and it bows when assembled due to too little support.&nbsp; The base isn&#39;t as strong as it could be and doesn&#39;t really look like a complete movie set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The phone holder doesn&#39;t fit larger model phones such as the LG V20 which many of the newer phones are.&nbsp; It also has no controls for the left to right movement or zoom.&nbsp; It only has controls for tilting forward or back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no software included to use that would include Batman themed effects so you have to trial and error with third-party software.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I give this a very low score.</p>
