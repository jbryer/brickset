<p>The nexo&nbsp;knights monster is a great army builder for fans of the nexo knights antagonists .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build starting with the head has two very large horn pieces and basic eye and forehead structure . The body is where it gets more interesting because the jawline of the beast continues down the entirety of the body using the 1&times;2 white modified plate with three teeth , also the arms yet stubby are good as the have some poseability and three nice orange claws on each hand to hold onto enemys . The legs have one joint of articulation and are nicely sloped along the sides . The one Accessory included is a hammer which is nicely textured and study .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>I believe coming from a person who didn&#39;t like nexo knights this is a good set that is well built for such an inconsequential set for nexo knights fans I recommend it for Lego fans I recommend it .</p>
