"thisisteekay","2017-02-18T04:09:23.78Z","Incredible Insight! Highly Recommended","<p>This book delves into the creation of the film. Not too wordy, this book gives an overview of the production process, and spends most of it&#39;s time showing off characters and locations. Tons of sketches, concept art, and sketch models built from bricks. There are some shots of illustrations that ended up on bricks in the film, like a number of the billboards and photographs seen around Wayne Manor.</p>

<p>There are a number of single one-off quotes from people involved in the production, but most of the text is giving you context about the content being shown off.</p>

<p>A number of easter eggs are unveiled, as you might expect.</p>

<p>It was interesting to find out about the alternate variations of Barbara Gordon&#39;s character planned, as well as the original decade the movie could have been set in, and how it may have looked.</p>

<p>What was most fascinating to me were the insights into TLG. There are a couple photos of sculpts, how colours are used internally, and some interesting info about 2K (dual) moulding.</p>

<p>The book doesn&#39;t go over music or sound in great detail, and the entire final act of villainous characters are completely missing.</p>

<p>I still have some unanswered questions about the animation process for Clayface, as well as the effects (brick-based explosions, etc). Would have loved a mini interview from the composer.</p>

<p>The book is far from being fully comprehensive, but it&#39;s still definitely worth picking up.</p>
