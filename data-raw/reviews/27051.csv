<p>Packaging / Instructions<br />
The set is packed in a foil bag, larger than usual. Unfortunately, it cannot be reused - you can tear it apart or cut it open. There are detailed instructions in stock that are relatively unnecessary.</p>

<p>Minifigures<br />
There are no figures in the set - the Merlok hologram is one brick, which I will discuss later.</p>

<p>Parts<br />
With this set, we get some useful parts. The silver &quot;spider web&quot;, transparent Antenna 1 &times; 4 with Rounded Top and the Merlok hologram are the most interesting of them. In addition, we get several robotic arms, parts for the base and elements of a cane, including a transparent 1 &times; 1 pyramid.<br />
The Merlok hologram that I was talking about is nicely printed, and the identical only appears in 70317: The Fortrex, so it&#39;s a nice deal.</p>

<p>Overall<br />
Great selection of parts for a reasonable price. Perfect if you don&#39;t want to buy the big Nexo Knights wave sets but want Merlok.</p>
