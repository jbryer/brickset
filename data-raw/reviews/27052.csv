It &nbsp;gives you two figures that have never been in a set before &nbsp; (ash and shade) and one figure who is in an exclusive suit (skylor). This pack is better than the other packs because the exclusive figures are actually designed from the to show.</p>

<p>PROS:</p>

<p>lots of weapons, good price, 3 rare figures and hair and hoods for two figures.</p>

<p>CONS:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its a bit more expensive than buying 3 of the Lego batman&nbsp;movie minifigure series blind bags.</p>

"Psychic_Tempest_Zero","2017-05-20T19:53:47.703Z","More Elemental Masters!","<p>Ninjago: Season 4:&nbsp;Tournament of Elements was, in my opinion and many others&#39;,&nbsp;Ninjago&#39;s&nbsp;best season, but the wave of sets&nbsp;released alongside it was definitely lacking a lot, with most of those sets being oversized vehicles that were only seen on-screen for a few seconds. &nbsp;However, our biggest gripe was definitely the release of only 3 Elemental Master minifigures&nbsp;in physical form: Skylor, Karlof, and Griffin Turner. &nbsp;Sure,&nbsp;Paleman and Tox could be acquired from Ultra Agents sets, but these characters were one&nbsp;of the most important aspects of the season, and for 2 years that&nbsp;collection has been very&nbsp;incomplete, until now.</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>The 2017 Ninjago Accessory set contains 3 minifigures&nbsp;with&nbsp;accessories, unlike past Accessory sets, which contained 4, which feels like a bit of a stretch of&nbsp;this price to me, not to mention&nbsp;it cheated us out of one more Elemental Master minifigure, but I feel this is a minor bug. &nbsp;The 3&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;of this set are Ash, Shade, and Skylor,&nbsp;(in the&nbsp;outfit we&#39;ve seen her in since Skybound) and in my opinion Ash the&nbsp;Master of Smoke is the best of the three: he looks just as he did in the show, and his color scheme of light grey and grey-ish blue looks great; they&#39;ve even included his hair piece (also in grey-ish blue)&nbsp;to interchange with his hood! &nbsp;All of his prints are done well, specifically his face. &nbsp;Shade the Master of Shadow looks more or less as he&nbsp;did in the show, with a few minor details done differently, but I don&#39;t mind. &nbsp;His legs are dual-molded in dark grey and black,&nbsp;but they lack a bit of print that would have been nice. &nbsp;His torso print looks really cool, but I feel it needs some kind of belt or something to transition to his legs better. &nbsp;His face print is done well, and he has his hair. &nbsp;Skylor the Master of &#39;Amber&#39; (Element absorption and mimicry) is the problem. &nbsp;Her colors are done right, and the inclusion of her hair piece as well as her hood&nbsp;is great, but&nbsp;her head looks a little faded to me. &nbsp;Holding her head up next to another yellow minifigure head, I see that I am right: her head piece is indeed faded in color. &nbsp;What&#39;s more, her face print looks very blown up: her eyes and lips are larger than those on her last minifigure. &nbsp;The print job is done incorrectly on her torso and legs too, with there being a considerably wide&nbsp;gap in&nbsp;her belt. &nbsp;Looking online, I see these same mistakes on every single one of these Skylor minifigures, so this was not a simple machine error.</p>

<p>Weapons/Accessories:</p>

<p>The weapons in this set are ordinary, there&#39;s a sheath with Katanas, a Butterfly Sword, an unprinted&nbsp;shield, a bow and a quiver, and two oversized &#39;smoke-bombs&#39;, plus a single piece of sushi. &nbsp;They&#39;re&nbsp;good if you&#39;ve just started getting Ninjago sets, I guess.</p>

<p>Verdict:</p>

<p>I&#39;m upset with the Skylor&nbsp;minifigure, but the Ash and Shade are great. &nbsp;I hope that the remaining five Elemental Masters (Neuro, Gravis, Bolobo, Chamille, and Jacob Pevsner, with maybe the addition&nbsp;of a Karlof in metal form)&nbsp;will be released somehow within the next few years, but for now, my Elemental Master collection looks much better, and I can now reenact some scenes from Ninjago: Season 4. &nbsp;Buying this from Lego.com/shop&nbsp;came out to more than $20 for me, which is a plain rip-off, as buying 3 Collectable Minifigures&nbsp;would come out to half of that, but if you&#39;d like to pay a little extra for these exclusive minifigures, there&#39;s now the option to get them.</p>

"Lego_fan_","2019-01-17T00:19:37.95Z","Calling all elemental fighters.","<p>This is a great set from the collection of Ninjago&nbsp;sets. I think it is a great way to get three minifigures for the money. The figures include Shade master of shadow, Skylor&nbsp;master of Amber, and Ash master of smoke. They come with a nice weapon selection and two of them come with an alternative hair pieces. They are from The Hands of time but is Also a great way to get two exclusive Minifiures&nbsp;from season four. I recommend this set to any Ninjago&nbsp;fans or fans of Lego in general.</p>
