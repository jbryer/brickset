<p>Ultimate Lego star wars is the best Lego book ever released . But you may think &quot;oh but it doesn&#39;t come with any physical bricks&quot; yes it doesn&#39;t but it is so comprehensive with Lego star wars leading up to summer 2017 .</p>

<p>The book-</p>

<p>Out of the 320 pages 114 overall take up characters and creatures , 30 pages for locations and 150 pages for vehicles and equipment . Every magazine , every polybag , every side build , every con exclusive and every set up to its release date is here . Every Jedi , every with ,every clone , every rebel , every pirate ,every bounty hunter , every stormtrooper and every droid . Basically it has everything . In conclusion I personally got the special edition with a case and two exclusive art prints for &pound;8 last year from my local book shop which is an sneakily bargain from the &pound;35 retail probably the best deal I have gotten a Lego set other than the 2018 city hospital for &pound;47.27 from &pound;70 .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>I would definitely recommend it for any Lego star wars obsesive like myself .</p>
