"Odeinoichus","2018-03-24T17:07:33.47Z","NEXO Knights slowly winding down with an impressive book.","<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">LEGO NEXO KNIGHTS Character Encyclopedia:</span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;""> Character Encyclopedia&rsquo;s are always a real treat, we&rsquo;ve seen roughly ten at this point including upgraded &amp; expanded editions. I half expect to see another one soon for The LEGO Movie, or even The LEGO Batman Movie, but this particular book was made for the LEGO Nexo Knights Theme and includes not only write-ups on both seasons of the show up to this point, but also includes NEXO powers for you to scan with the App and some behind the scenes material.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Presentation</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The presentation is once again similar to many of the past Character Encyclopedia&rsquo;s, the cover is all white with images of many of the characters from the Theme on front and back. The Minifigure is prominent on the front in his little plastic tray and you can see him quite closely.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The page design is also quite similar giving us write-ups and facts on all of the Minifigures and the rest. By which I mean that, much like the Legends of Chima and Ninjago encyclopedia&rsquo;s there are pages dedicated to sets, models and many other aspects from the Theme such as the NEXO powers.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minifigure</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Semi-Stone Clay: This Minifigure is a huge spoiler from Series/Season Two apparently, honestly I haven&rsquo;t been following the television show. That being said he&rsquo;s a very nicely detailed looking figure. He includes some great highly detailed printing showcasing the effects of Clay&rsquo;s stone curse as he starts to be transformed into full stone.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">His head is dual-sided for the printing with one side being normal and the other looking terrified as he starts to turn to stone with his skin visibly cracking and becoming stone. For accessories he gets a nifty looking sword and a unique NEXO Power.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This NEXO Power is Chrome Bell, according to the book, and features a large cloister bell swinging as its ringing. Overall a decent looking Minifigure with some nice accessories.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Contents</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Covered in the pages of this book are roughly every character and set found in 2016 and 2017, there&rsquo;s also an interview with the design crew and some interesting concept images. Rounding off the last few pages are set galleries from 2016 and 2017&hellip; Once again LEGO chooses to allow DK to omit some things, a few Polybags are mysteriously absent from the set galleries, notably the Freebies given away through LEGO S&amp;H and all of the 2017 sets, which is odd as one of those Polybags is referenced in the set lists under the Fast Facts blurbs detailing where you can find all of the Minifigures in each set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Sadly they did not make a Minifigure Image Page like they did with Ninjago. Also, for whatever reason, DK and LEGO included an image of Series 2 of the Combo NEXO Power booster bags, which to my memory were never actually released, only Series 1 was made available at Retail and that packaging shot is not included in the overall set gallery.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Many of the pages get by very nicely detailing features of the sets or information on the television show plot points. (Be forewarned there are Spoilers in this book to some key plot elements.) There are a few instances of misidentified sets, using names that are not the official ones. Also, some of the Did You Know bubbles repeat facts and information between each other. Overall though, the contents is very thorough and very enjoyable to read. Especially all of the factoid bubbles detailing the NEXO Powers and their various effects. Apparently there are over 300 powers, I feel that the book omits some of these and not every power is included, despite the fact that most pages includes NEXO Power write ups for whatever Power is included in the set being described&hellip; Forbidden Powers are also covered, one or two are misclassified as NEXO Powers however and one NEXO Power is repeated between two pages&hellip; I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">For Fans of the LEGO NEXO Knights Theme this is a must have reading compendium, it isn&rsquo;t 100% perfect, but DK has this habit of missing some key facts, making some mistakes or downright omitting a lot of LEGO Products from their Set Galleries. Polybags are the most notable of these omissions, however it should be noted that the Armour Pod and the Free Giveaway Royal Knight in the Cardboard Box was also missing from the set gallery.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I&rsquo;d still recommend this book if only due to the exclusive Minifigure, NEXO Power and impressive early concept artwork for sets, characters and monsters that we could have seen in LEGO NEXO Knights. Recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
