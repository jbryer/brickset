"Zapp_Brannigan","2008-04-06T21:16:37.217Z","Set does not meet expectations, save accessories","What's wrong with the police car and building? I'll tell you what. First the building: Very poorly designed. I mean, why would the entrance be a giant piece of cardboard? It's weak and undecent. Why couldn't they just use good old windows and doors instead? Those poor minifigs, who don't have a place to enter. Where are the walls? I don't think pillars would do the trick. Then robbers can just walk right in and steal everything &gt;_&lt;. What's the point of having a second floor? If they build a second floor, they should at least make it into nice offices. Also, why is the second floor only four studs wide? Putting stuff into it would be next to impossible! In conclusion, the building is just blah and unrealistic. So instead, I used the windows and the 6x16 plate for MUCH better uses, like building a MUCH improved building. Now it's time to discuss the police car: Again, very poorly designed. The bricks used are too basic and make the car look bulky. Also, how would the officer see where he's going with a 1x4 flat plate in his way? Obviously, the window should be taller. Where would the officer put his phone when he driving. It would be inconvenient to hold the phone when he's driving. Also, how come the car doesn't have a roof? What if bad weather hits? In conclusion, the police car is the most terrible I ever seen. Older ones are better than this! This set wasn't a complete rip though. The safe and money were useful, and so were the spotlights, camera and blockades. That's the only good thing about this set. Overall, a terrible set. I suggest you avoid this set completely unless you want the accessories, or you'll regret it. Believe me, it's worse than it looks.

"Bricktoothyo","2008-06-17T00:14:53.92Z","Does whatever a spider can...","I picked this one up pretty cheap by memory and I really like it. Sure,the bank is a bit one dimensional but if you build onto it its very very nice. Its got its uses too,from Town/city or Batman! Not only do you get Spidey,but you get a Peter Parker with a little camera,HOW COOL IS THAT?
The cop car is pretty lousy,but the cop himself is a complete dude! Its got a lot of playability this set has,and if you check out the box you can make a police boat and jetty out of it. The bank robber is a nice minifig also,and the barricades,stage lights and camera are a welcome bonus,not to mention the Director minifig. All up,theres a lot going on here and I must say I think its definitely worth the money!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"UFO_and_Insectoids","2011-06-01T00:22:46.527Z","Swing into Action!","<p>This is the very first Spider-Man set I got, and for the most part it is a very cool set. The main thing I thought this set had going for it was the new pieces and accessories (i.e-Spidey minifig, web net piece, etc.). The bank is pretty cool too, although the cardboard base piece is somewhat flimsy and falls out easily. Other than that, it is a well designed set and great addition to the Spiderman theme! Below are a list of the pros and cons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cool minifigs including Spiderman, Policeman, Movie director that looks like Steven Spielberg! 
<li>Rare pieces 
<li>The Bank and police car are cool!</li></ul>
<p><strong>Cons-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Cardboard piece is flimsy and falls out easily 
<li>Bank could have been a little bigger</li></ul>
<p>Other than that, none that I can think of, Set deserves 4/5!</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4

<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Includes Spider Man with webbing 
<li>Comes with Police&nbsp;Minifigure and Police Car 
<li>Includes robber and money 
<li>Rare pieces 
<li>Steven Spielburg minifigure and camera 
<li>Good for both Spider Man films and cops vs. robbers films</li></ul>
<p>Cons: </p>
<ul>
<li>Building is just a prop (meaning it has just one wall)</li></ul>
<p>If you want to incorporate Spider Man, robbers, and policemen into your Lego animations or in your Lego minfigure displays, then this is the set to get.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-22T12:07:34.52Z","Spider-Man, Spider-Man Does Whatever a Spider Can","<p>Set #1376 Spider-Man Action Studio: The key word in that title is Studio. This set is part of the Studios Theme and therefore, despite being a Spider-Man based set, it does have a few flaws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll discuss the models first however. The main model is the Spider-Man Action Studio, a New York City bank <strong>set</strong> from a movie studio backlot. The building has very little pieces involved in the actual walls and uses a piece of cardboard to give the illusion of being a full building, but it is a movie set and not meant to be a real building. The pieces however are quite useful for MOCing purposes, and it wouldn't be difficult to use spare pieces to make actual walls and probably expand this into a fully functional set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The studio lights, camera and barricades are all small little doubled up models that you can build to enhance the movie set look of this model. In fact without them this would be a pretty sorry excuse for a movie set. I think the set is great as it is, but that is my opinion and it may be a little bit clouded by a love of all things movies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The police car is a fully functional vehicle for the actor portraying a NYC Cop to drive after the crook in. There is only one problem with it and the bank model, the stickers for details. It wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have to put the sticker across two pieces so that whenever you're disassembling the set for storage you have to keep those two pieces together or risk destroying the sticker.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mini-Figures time. This set includes a lot of nice Mini-Figures, some of them rare, which makes me kick myself when I think about how I gave away the two Spider-Man Studios sets rather than keeping them. Anyway... There is of course a Director complete with megaphone accessory, there is the standard Studios cameraman, a Studios Stuntman/Crook, a Police Officer with a black hat and Peter Parker and Spider-Man. Spider-Man is a really great Mini-Figure and quite unique, Peter Parker has a double-sided head and the camera accessory that I think was introduced in this set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One side of Peter's head has glasses the other does not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall this is a great looking Studios set, but it is definitely not meant to represent an actual building. It's for pretending that LEGO Town/City is also getting the hot-ticket Spider-Man movie and filming has begun. I definitely recommend this set to Studios enthusiasts, Spider-Man enthsuiasts because of the Mini-Figures and Mini-Figure enthusiasts who collect the rare and unique looking Mini-Figures LEGO offers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I just wish it didn't need those stupid stickers for the police car. The only LEGO set I ever owned with Stickers where I felt the Stickers were a detriment to the look of the set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-31T05:26:32.25Z","LEGO Studios (Spider-Man) - Spider-Man Action Studio Review","This is maybe not part of the movies but it's still a cool set to have. It's one of the first LEGO Spider-Man sets which came out and it also comes with a CD and some other cool accessories like two barriers, two flood lights, two fires and a camera with a stand. We also get a cool looking police car and two spiderwebs for Spider-Man. We also get a bank and a bank robber who comes with some money. The bank is a nice addition to any LEGO city you're building. What's weird about this bank is that the front of the bottom with the entrance just has a cardboard piece. It's a double printed piece which shows you the inside of the bank. In the inside of the bank we don't get much. We just get a desk where you can hide the money and a chair. Everything we get in this set is very sturdy and it's a fun built. I also can't complain about the number of minifigs we get in this model. It's a great set to add to your LEGO city for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
