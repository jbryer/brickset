"Lego_fan_","2019-12-31T04:24:25.073Z","EARTH!","<p>This Lego Cole magazine set is a great addition to any Lego Ninjago collection.</p>

<p>Cole appears to be in his day of the departed/season 7 era suit and comes with the option for his hair or hood. He also includes a sword holder on his back with a katana. His main wepon though is a big hammer which is brick built. My only problem with these magazine gift sets is that they never come with instructions( not that you need it with this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall i would tell all loyal Lego Ninjago fans that they must get this great set for the collection.</p>
