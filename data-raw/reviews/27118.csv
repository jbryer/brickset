It is being sold to compliment an offer in the supermarket where you get free packs of Lego trading cards when you spend certain amounts of money. The 140 cards to collect (with an collectors album to put them in) is currently amusing the children (and quite a few grown ups) of the UK. However the vast majority of Lego fans would much rather have actual bricks to build things with. So here we have this nice little set.</p>

<p>The set is a small&nbsp;3 in 1 creator set, but unlike most of the smaller sets there are actually two minifigs included. These&nbsp;two little folks are also unusual in the fact they have names. Except for minifigs based on movie characters etc, they don&#39;t generally come with names. But this pair do. Sam and Lily they are called. They are having an exciting adventure travelling&nbsp;the world - according to the collectors album anyway! To help them with their travels they have a map, a tiny suitcase, a giant phone and a camera to save their memories!</p>

<p>I think Sam must be in charge of the map reading as his head comes with two faces - one smiling but the other looking a tad&nbsp;worried.</p>

<p>Lily on the other hand is obviously more laid back as her two faces are one smiling too,&nbsp;but her other one has her&nbsp;eyes&nbsp;closed, so she is obviously happy to&nbsp;have&nbsp;a little nap while Sam leads the way!</p>

<p>And how do they travel... well being a 3 in 1 they have a car, a boat and a helicopter! What a way to travel the world!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>All three are clever in that both Sam and Lily can fit in at the same time - which is unusual for the smaller Lego vehicles.&nbsp;Not a lot of space for their luggage though and whoever isn&#39;t driving will have to hold the camera and the map and I&#39;m not sure where the phone can go.</p>

<p>This is a really nice little starter set. In order to make the three little vehicles you get a selection of various interesting pieces and shows you can make something very cool with not many pieces. Most &#39;starter&#39; sets people would buy would more likely be a Classic set that is just bricks or you have the ones where you get a few figures but not much to actually build. This one would make a perfect gift for the Lego beginner.</p>

<p>At the moment the set is being sold exclusively at Sainsbury&#39;s supermarket and is fairly cheap at &pound;8&nbsp;but I think small simple sets in this general price range &nbsp;(that aren&#39;t connected to a specific theme) with a couple of minifigs is what Lego should definitely do more of. I would definitely buy more if there was some.</p>

"Minifig290","2018-09-08T12:37:37.833Z","Great Promotional Set","<p>Hello there, Today i&rsquo;ll be looking at&nbsp;the 2017 Sainsbury&rsquo;s Exclusive promotional set the 40256 Create The World that was released to Sainsbury&rsquo;s to coincide with a Card promo that has since made a comeback with a newer series. This set retailed for &pound;8 and has 113 parts giving a Price Per Part of 7p.</p>

<p>This set is a 3 in 1 and can build. Car, Helicopter or a Boat and includes to Minifigures and a few accessories. Let&rsquo;s look at all of this now.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>There are two minifigs&nbsp;a girl called Lily and a boy called Sam. Lily has plain unprinted Purple pants and a pink stripped torso that has a flower necklace. Her face is double sided with one side smiling and happy and the other is showing her having a little sleep, and her hair is just a common dark brown ponytail.</p>

<p>Sam has plain unprinted dark blue pants and a Light azure hoodie with a stripped line and green shirt printed on the torso. Like Lily he has a double sided face one showing a smile with some freckles and the other showing a worried face with freckles, to top him off is another common hair piece a short dark nougat hair part.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>There are 6 minifigure accessories and 1 human accessory. The six minifigure accessories are two yellow life jackets for Sam and Lily, a camera with a lens build, a 2x2 tan tile with a map print, a green briefcase and finally a 1x2 light gray tile with a smart phone print. There&rsquo;s also a Human Accessory the extremely common but useful orange Brick Separator.</p>

<p><strong>Builds</strong></p>

<p>There are enough parts to build only one of the three builds at a time sadly. The remaining 90 or so parts can build either a car, a helicopter or a simple speed boat. Let&rsquo;s look at all 3.</p>

<p><strong>1. Car</strong></p>

<p>The car build is extremely simple but is the best of three in many peoples eyes. It can seat two minifigures like the other two builds can. The base is built using many medium sized plates and two wheel attachments with 4 wheels. The back has two brake lights a white tile for a lose license plate. There are a few sloped tan parts for a backrest at the back. The rest of the interior hasn&rsquo;t just 8 studs for 2 figs and a plain white steering&nbsp;wheel. The front has a trans light blue windshield with one wing mirror on each side of the windshield&nbsp;and the bonnet and the front license plate and headlights plus a silver grid part for a radiator. After building this build leaves a total of 34 parts excluding minifig and accessories part.</p>

<p><strong>2. Speed Boat</strong></p>

<p>The boat uses the least of the parts i believe. At the back of the boat there is a engine build built using g a few slopes and the silver grill part. The interior has enough space for two figs and that&rsquo;s it. The trans blue windshield with the same wing mirrors&nbsp;is used in this build as well&nbsp;as&nbsp;the same bonnet hood part at the front. The base of the boat is simple just using a few plates and inverted slope parts. The boat does not float. After building this your left with a grand total of 68 spare parts left over excluding the figure and accessories parts.</p>

<p><strong>3. Small Helicopter</strong></p>

<p>Finally the small helicopter, this build is the largest in terms of length. The legs of the helicopter uses 4 parts two toolbar parts and 1x6 white plates. The cockpit of the helicopter has no internal decoration just enough space for two figures. The cockpit window is a trans light blue helicopter windshield part that is connected by two clips meaning the window can move up and down for more accessibility. The helicopters tail is a simple build using around 20 or so parts that has a small rotator and fin part. The copters blades are just 2 1x6 black plates with a round tile connecting them onto a rotating 2x2 plate. After building this your left with 47 spare parts.</p>

<p>_______________________________</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>To conclude this review of a great &pound;8 promotional set i&rsquo;d say get these before they get even more pricy on eBay. The set is well priced and the 3 builds are great fun builds that inspires creativity. My favourite build is the main build the car as it is a clever build using fairly common easy to&nbsp;obtain parts. My least favourite&nbsp;&nbsp;is the helicopter just because it&rsquo;s quite blocky and something about it i don&rsquo;t like but can&rsquo;t quite explain it though.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>The price of &pound;8, Figures, Accesories, Car build, Boat Build, Easy to build</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>helicopter build, Exclusivity as many other countries couldn&rsquo;t get it.</p>

<p>Sainsburys is a UK supermarket chain. The promotion of the curren cards end October 8th.</p>
