"Minifig290","2018-02-20T14:11:21.067Z","Quite A Disappointing Series","<p>This minifigure series was released in May 2017 for &pound;3, $4 and comes with 16 minifigures&nbsp;and has 99 pieces overall. All the figures will be rated out of 100% and the names of each figure aren&#39;t accurate.</p>

<p><strong>1. Surfer Dude</strong></p>

<p>This is the 3rd collectable minifigure&nbsp;surfer but he does have a great printed surfboard but this figure should have been released on a later date cause 2017 summer has a ton of better surfers.&nbsp;He gets a total of 34%</p>

<p><strong>2. Historical Weight&nbsp;Lifter (My Least Favorite&nbsp;Figure From This Series)</strong></p>

<p>EWWWW&nbsp;to this figure, he has nothing good about him absolutely nothing. His weight&nbsp;piece could be useful but they had to print 100 on it why and the print on this figure isn&#39;t anything good. He gets a total of 13%</p>

<p><strong>3. Pastry Chief (My Second Favorite Figure From This Series)</strong></p>

<p>This figure is so awesome as she has some useful parts like her Strawberry Pie and Whisk and her torso. She is also the first CMF chief. She gets a total of 95%</p>

<p><strong>4. Corn On The Cob Guy</strong></p>

<p>And now back to a bad figure. This is a useless figure as we don&#39;t have a corn on the cob part so he is useless in a LEGO universe that has no corn. He gets a total of 30%</p>

<p><strong>5. Vet</strong></p>

<p>Finally another good figure. She is the first CMF doctor in a long while. Her patient&nbsp;(a rabbit) is a new and exclusive mold. Her hair is also new and useful&nbsp;along with her torso and legs. She gets a total of 90%</p>

<p><strong>6. Hot Dog Server (My Favorite Figure Form This Series)</strong></p>

<p>This is without a doubt the greatest CMF of 2017 in my opinion everything about this figure is useful. He has a new tray mold that can hold a hot dog and new plain unprinted squishy cup. His hat is great for a waiter/waitress army so is the rest of the figure. His face print is a young face and can be used for a child or teen which i love. He gets a well deserved 100%</p>

<p><strong>7. Butterfly Girl</strong></p>

<p>What a cute little figure. This little figure has some great parts like her new wings in pink what have some great print on. Her face and hair would have been more useful if there wasn&#39;t any flower prints on but she still looks great. Her accessory is a bunch of flowers which is a bit lame in my eyes. She gets a total of 83%</p>

<p><strong>8. Roman Fighter</strong></p>

<p>We are half way there and we are talking about the Roman Fighter who is rather uninteresting but Finn&#39;s hair in brown that is in this set is a great part to get and overall he is a basic and boring figure that somehow is quite good. He gets a total of 69%</p>

<p><strong>9. Connoisseur</strong></p>

<p>The Connoisseur is a alright figure who has great parts but overall isn&#39;t to great. One of his accessories is a new pug mold that looks fantastic, he also has a baggute.The figure himself is boring. He gets a total of 64%</p>

<p><strong>10. Dwarf</strong></p>

<p>Clearly big things come out of small things cause this is a great little dude. His torso is very detailed and great and his red Mohawk&nbsp;and beard is awesome to get. He includes two accessories, a hammer that has a rhino printed on it and a axe. He gets a total of 90%</p>

<p><strong>11. Space Warrior</strong></p>

<p>Now this figure is a rather popular figure in this series cause he has great molding for his hat and awesome ray gun that has since been released in the Batman Movie CMF series 2 fro Killer Moth. His cape is the most useful thing for me though in a bright yellow color. He gets a total of 76%&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>12. Yuppie</strong></p>

<p>Since when did Paradisa&nbsp;return. This figure is a throwback for some people to that great theme with his hair and face print with 80&#39;s glasses and his massive old brick phone. I think he would make a great scientist for some reason. He gets a total of 90%</p>

<p><strong>13. Space Rocket Suit Boy</strong></p>

<p>3..2..1..BLAST OFF. What a cool figure. I love the mold for his rocket as it could be used for other things than minifigures. And his torso has a classic space logo on it which is marvelous and his flag has a hand drawn space logo with stars around it and it is fantastic LEGO included that print. Overall he gets a blasting 87%</p>

<p><strong>14. Dance Instructor</strong></p>

<p>Now what a step back&nbsp;for this series, this figure is horrid utterly horrid, her hair is disgusting and the color is weird. The only good thing about her is the water bottle. She gets a total of 20%&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>15. Elf Warrior</strong></p>

<p>Now this is a step forward, although she is a re-do of the series 9 Elf figure but it is a good re-do comparing to other re-do&#39;s in this series. Her torso and skirt print and shield has a nice reflecting&nbsp;shine to it and looks fun. She gets a shining total of 85%</p>

<p><strong>16. Highway Man (Secret Figure) (My Third Favorite Figure From This Series)</strong></p>

<p>Its a secret so i can&#39;t tell you about this figure, joking this figure has a very well detail torso that looks great with double molded legs that has a great print on it as well. He comes with two guns in brown and his hat is a cool piece to get. He has a cape that is a bit annoying to put on the figure but looks good when it is on. He gets a mysterious&nbsp;total of 94%</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This series is a alright series but comparing it to the Batman and Ninjago movie series it is a lot weaker thanks to 4-6 awful figures but there are two stand out figures that are great and they are Hot Dog Server and Pastry Chief.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Great accessories throughout the series and awesome new mold in selected figures.</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>There are multiple&nbsp;figures that are re-prints of previous figures like the Surfer, Dancer, Weight lifter, Elf Warrior.</p>
