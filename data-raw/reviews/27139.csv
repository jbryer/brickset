<br />
I certainly wouldn&#39;t argue against that.<br />
<br />
But I would like to point out what he does offer.<br />
<br />
You&#39;ve got a nice shark print board. &nbsp;It really does look good, and not being a surfer myself, I have little doubt that shark print boards are probably pretty common. &nbsp;Bearing that in mind, I like that it adds a level of realistic detail to any build I cared to make around a surfing theme.<br />
<br />
I want to make a surf shop as part of a larger beach MOC - which will also be helped immensely by the new Fun at the Beach figure set.<br />
<br />
Which brings me to the other two good things about the set: the wet suit top and the head.<br />
<br />
I like variety, and will gladly pay for it. &nbsp;Now my surf shop, and indeed some of my surfers, have another selection. &nbsp;I could have wished for some red on the legs, too, to unify the wet suit a little more, and help justify another surfer to other collectors, but no such luck.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s always good to get another head print. &nbsp;As my city expands, and the population grows, so does my palette with every new face that comes out.<br />
<br />
So while the figure is not great, it is, at least for what I can do with it, good. &nbsp;His primary strength is his variety, and that&#39;s good enough for me.</p>

"Speed_champions_fan","2017-07-23T07:55:19.573Z","Underrated but great and useful","<p>Shortly after they were released by Lego, Brickset&nbsp;had a poll to find out the most popular of the new series of minifigures. This guy was nearly last. I&#39;m not entirely sure why though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with the hair. He has the same piece as Luke&nbsp;Skywalker, and it still looks great. It&#39;s well textured and has an interesting style.</p>

<p>His face has some blonde-ish&nbsp;stubble and eyebrows, one of which is raised. He has considerable wrinkles which make him look old before his hair goes on. He has a lopsided smile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an interesting note: if you have the city coast guard starter set the surfer in that set looks like he could be related to this guy; maybe they&#39;re brothers or perhaps this one is the other&#39;s dad?</p>

<p>The torso has red printing that has some black lines on it. In the centre is a wave logo that I believe first appeared on the diver in CMF series one. But the best part is the arms. I&#39;ve never seen more intricate detail on a non-licensed figure. The red striping looks awesome on black, and it lines up well with the shoulders. Unfortunately there is no back printing. At least a zip would be nice here.</p>

<p>The legs are plain black, which, while a bit disappointing, still looks ok. However, if you have any city divers sets, the printed legs from those look great on this figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, there&#39;s a blue board with a clear reference to jaws on it. It looks cool, but the series four surfer&#39;s board&nbsp;had more intricate printing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In summary, I feel that this is a wonderful figure. If you&#39;re looking for a surfer to display, get this. If you&#39;re looking for a surfer to put in a city, get this. If you&#39;re looking for a nice face, get this. I think it&#39;s just a great figure.</p>

<p>The Professional Surfer doesn&#39;t have much to discuss as far as detailing or the like, using a wet suit design similar to past wet suits, only this time featuring arm printing, this minifigure has no printing on the legs, however his surfboard more than makes up for that, with awesome detail work showing a shark print. A very impressive shark print.</p>

<p>This minifigure also includes the new hair sculpt used by Luke Skywalker, which is pretty good if you&#39;re looking for that part for some MOC figures. Overall this is a nice offering from Series 17, a fun start to a pretty great series. Definitely recommended.</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2020-12-08T17:56:22.683Z","Great board ","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>The professional surfer is a bland figure with a great board , great arm printing but lacking legs and hair .&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The figure has a nice hair piece but unfortunately comes in the exceedingly common light tan Luke Skywalker version which isn&#39;t very interesting , the head is nice with sideburns and a smirk , the torso is fine and lacks back printing but the arms are great depicting red wetsuit stripes and the legs are as dull as they can get just being in plain black .&nbsp;</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>The accessory is the best part depicting a surf board with shark printing in the iconic jaws poster position . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a rather disappointing figure as the arms and accessory are the only parts of real interest and I know it was over 3 years ago but a CMF who lacks back and leg printing is not very good but I recommend it for the board .</p>
