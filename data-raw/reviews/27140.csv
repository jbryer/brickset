Step right up!!!","<p><strong>Set #71018 Circus Strong Man:</strong> Number 2 on the Checklist harkens back to a bygone era, why is it bygone? Because the entertainment industry has changed a great deal since the days of such spectacular shows as the Circus.</p>

<p>This minifigure looks great, with the new mustache piece and a double-sided torso print with dual-molded legs showing off the muscles and typical, perhaps almost stereotypical, Strongman outfit. He also includes a brand new element, a Barbel piece. This new element alone is great and shows LEGO has come a long way, Series 2 had a Bodybuilder which used a buildable Barbel, but now LEGO has sculpted a new piece and it&#39;s great for folks wanting to MOC a gym or circus.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d recommend this fun little figure as he does represent a Historical figure, seen most often in the 1920&#39;s and such. He&#39;d look great next to the Modular Detective&#39;s Office.</p>

<p>The circus strongman is a figure that widely went under the radar for many fans from the now 3+ years old series 17 .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The figure has a confident facial expression with some large eyebrows , a moustache neck attachment , a torso with strongman uniform printing a leopard print style and the legs continue the leopard print with some dual moulded boots .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>His only accessory is an exclusive mould for a dumbbell which features 100 printing on each sphere ( likely representing the weight of 100kg ) . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a very fun figure , from the moustache to the dual moulding on the legs it is just well done and so I recommend it .</p>
