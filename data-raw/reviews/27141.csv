"LucMeister070","2017-11-07T21:44:43.573Z","Would you like a strawberry pie?","<p>I decided to review this collectible minifig, because nobody has done a review on it yet.</p>

<p>The Gourmet Chef is an excellent figure, it introduces a new Chef&#39;s hat with female hair attached to it, which is super useful, since we can&#39;t attach hair to hats.</p>

<p>The strawberry pie is a redesign of the rare but well know white pie piece, I really like the strawberry prints on the pie, it finally adds some real &#39;flavor&#39; to the boring pie we had before.</p>

<p>There is a small print on the legs, that shows the lower part of the chef&#39;s shirt. There&#39;s another tiny&nbsp;print on the arms, a button on each side. We get no back printing for this figure.</p>

<p>We get a plain&nbsp;female face for this minifig, nothing too&nbsp;special. However the light bluish gray whisk is an interesting piece, which will come in handy for kitchen MOC&#39;s. I believe it is the first time we see this piece in a Lego form.</p>

<p>Even though I think that the price for these figures has gone up a little bit too&nbsp;much, this figure is an amazing addition to my collection, especially for the pie piece. I would recommend it to people building their own Lego city, or to people wanting the pie piece :).</p>

"Odeinoichus","2018-04-18T15:22:06.563Z","Bake some Pies.","<p><strong>Set #71018 Gourmet Chef:</strong> Series 17 was a good source of brand new parts/elements, case in point this one features two great parts and an older element that hasn&#39;t been seen fairly often up to now.</p>

<p>The Gourmet Chef introduces a brand new head piece, a chef&#39;s hat with hair attached for female characters, or if you felt like it, male chefs with longer hair. A whisk is also included for beating eggs, this is a great new accessory piece and I&#39;m amazed LEGO Friends did not include one, although Friends did give us the electric egg beater, so perhaps the more traditional hand mixer wasn&#39;t as high priority.</p>

<p>She also includes a nice Strawberry pie, for her torso print we have a plain single-sided print featuring the usual Chef style seen in LEGO City, this version is not the same though, as it includes arm printing for the sleeve cuffs and a different design on the buttons. There is very limited printing on the belt of the legs to show the lower half of the chef coat.</p>

<p>Overall this is a really great Minifigure and I would definitely recommend tracking one down if you missed her initially. If you want the parts I&#39;d suggest getting a bunch as they will be of great use for your MOC ideas, I&#39;m sure. Strongly recommended.</p>

"Brickstarr","2018-11-05T20:17:40.137Z","' I Hope she'll rise to the occasion!'","<p>Today&nbsp;I will be reviewing set 71018-3 : Gourmet Chef from the collectable minifgures theme. she was in series 17</p>

<p>Packet- The packet is a standard light blue and is dotted with white question marks. On the front.,it contains the minifgures in that series with one silhouetted with a question mark on.</p>

<p>Build- This is an easy build as it is a minifigure and contains 6 pieces only. She has black trousers with the bottom bit of her top printed onto it. Her torso is white with black buttons on, a traditional chef&#39;s uniform. Her face is smiling with a hint of pink lipstick. Her short brown hair is molded with the toque which&nbsp;I love. She also has a nicely made spatula and a delicious looking strawberry pie which is all one piece.</p>

<p>Overall Summary-&nbsp;I would give this minifigure an A* ( this is slightly bias because&nbsp;I love food) because of it&#39;s amazing look and its pieces, one of which is iconic to this set ( cherry pie). It is definitely worth the mere &pound;3.00 or $4.00 that it is priced at. It would also be&nbsp;a good thing to put into MOCs and would go well with some of the advanced modular sets.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;hope this review was helpful</p>

<p>As always, Thank you&nbsp;for taking the time to read my review :)</p>
