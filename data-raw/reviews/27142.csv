<br />
That being said, I can understand why some people may be underwhelmed&nbsp;with Corn Cob Guy.<br />
<br />
The big corn piece is rather limited in application beyond costume parties, grocery store promos, clever gags, or large Lego Land scale dioramas. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, that face with that moustache?! &nbsp;Love it! &nbsp;That is an absolutely glorious cookie duster, that would work on any minifigure where you want to add a little levity.<br />
<br />
A plain green top could have a fair bit of use. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know how rare green pants are, but here are some more.<br />
<br />
I think this minifigure will likely fall into the love it, hate it, or just gotta have &#39;em all slots of opinion. &nbsp;I like him well enough. &nbsp;He&#39;s got a job at my City grocer.</p>

<p>Corn Cob Guy is great for folks who like Monofigs, why? Because his entire torso and legs are blank green, find some hands to match and a plain unprinted green head and you can make your own Monofig in green. That being said, the new sculpted food suit piece is awesome! It really looks like a corn cob and has a lot of nice sculpted detail work. His happy smiling face with the big bushy moustache looks fun too and quite suited for the character.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d strongly recommend hunting this thing down, especialy for the parts. Strongly recommended.</p>

Most coming from the fact that there is no LEGO system corn piece (though there is a LEGO Duplo&nbsp;corn piece, not many people know about it). I didn&#39;t care though. I had to have this minifigure!</p>

<p>Now, Why would I want this so badly? It is because I was born and raised in Nebraska, the Cornhusker state! This minifigure, while not being based off of anything from Nebraska in particular, fits in with this land so well! No matter what is cost, I had to have him! Now, I dodn&#39;t have the means necessary to buy him online, so I had to buy blind bags to find him. I ended up buying 51 packs just to find him (I ended up being short one figure to have a complete series which was supper frustrating&nbsp;and I still don&#39;t have that minifigure, but that is beside the point).</p>

<p>Now there is not printing on the torso or legs and they are molded in the normal green color and the corn piece itself is duel-molded in yellow and bright green. The face print is exclusive and features big, fuzzy eyebrows and a big, fuzzy mustache.</p>

<p>Overall, I am in love with this minifigure. It is a perfect example of my home state in LEGO and it is just a fun character to have.</p>
