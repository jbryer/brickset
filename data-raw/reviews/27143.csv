<br />
And that, I think, is what makes the CMFs so great in general. &nbsp;They can so easily inspire us to create new scenes. &nbsp;They are wonderful seed parts.<br />
<br />
I love the hair. &nbsp;It helps the minifigure bear a striking resemblance to Jennifer Anniston (though that could lead to a &quot;Friends&quot; tv show MOC... shudder...). &nbsp;The vet printing on light aqua, with dual moulded arms and blue hands is top shelf. &nbsp;I only hope that a plain light aqua leg assembly comes out, so I can use the torso for more hospital scenes. &nbsp;For now, I can just hope no one sees the paw print on their doctor&#39;s badge.<br />
<br />
The bunny! &nbsp;I LOVE the bunny! &nbsp;I think it will be better suited to a Monty Python and The Holy Grail MOC than the cutesy Friends line bunny. &nbsp;And I&#39;m that much closer to my Zoo, now with a Petting Zoo section, and it&#39;s own, on staff vets.</p>

<p>Our Veterinarian has some nice scrubs on, meaning she&#39;s dressed in typical nurse or doctor clothes with some nice printed detailing, a stethoscope draped around her neck, a small nametag attached to her leg with a nice paw print. She has dual-molded arms featuring a unique new colour, I&#39;m fairly sure this very light green (or teal possibly) hasn&#39;t been seen before.</p>

<p>And of course for an accessory she includes a cute little bunny rabbit. The rabbit differs from the LEGO Friends animal by featuring a different pose, less stylized Heartlake City looking curves and the style matches up with other LEGO animal pieces. A great new creature and an accessory that bumps up the desirability and demand of this figure in my opinion.</p>

<p>This one is strongly recommended from this Series. As you can see I picked up three, definitely think more than that would make a great LEGO City Farm rabbit population, or park if you prefer. Strongly Recommended.</p>
