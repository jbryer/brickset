"Evil_Pixie_Works","2017-06-10T21:03:58.89Z","Wonderful idea, however disapointing.","<p>As with all waves of Collectable Minifigures, once the new ones come out I tend to pick out what ones I want... along with those I don&#39;t wish.&nbsp; Sometimes it could be half or more of the whole series or none... or someplace in between.&nbsp; &quot;Hot Dog Man&quot; server, not to be confused with the guy wearing a hot dog suit from a collection in the near past, was perhaps 2 on the 5 I wanted from Collection 17.&nbsp; More based on being cute then how he could serve my Lego universe.&nbsp; However, I really don&#39;t like spending loads of money on mystery Minifigures, I wait and buy online so I know what I&#39;m getting.&nbsp; Just easier that way.&nbsp; :-)</p>

<p>Most of the time, even with the Minifigures I don&#39;t like... I will easily admit these designs are cute and could fit in any kind of play.&nbsp; From the very large city buildings all way down to original play as a child would use them... and even to just collect them on top of your computer monitor or a shelf in your home office work space.&nbsp; Normally, Lego designers have made a new hair part.. or something, that may be more desirable for us adult designers at home and we collect that Minifigure just for that.&nbsp; Perhaps that part becomes just something new in the never-ending bricks that they design from forever-more.</p>

<p>HOWEVER... one GREAT issue comes from this &quot;Hot Dog Man&quot; that greatly disappoints me and left me confused to why Lego &quot;quality control&quot; allowed it to pass on to production.&nbsp; That would be the tray you see holding the hot dog and drink.&nbsp; There is NO WAY to secure anything to the tray, on top.&nbsp; Below is something plus the hands can easily grip the edge... but anything on top of the tray has no way to stay on.&nbsp; The slightest little bump and everything falls off.&nbsp; Greatly disappointed.&nbsp; That&#39;s all I can say.&nbsp; One would have to use &quot;Krakle&quot; to make items stay... or some helpful rubber cement, that does no real harm.&nbsp; (Hint).&nbsp; Otherwise, get ready to easily loose anything set on top of the tray.</p>

"The_creative_box","2017-06-15T11:33:32.843Z","Review: Hot Dog Man","<p>When I first saw images of the Hot Dog Man I knew I had to get him, because of various reasons.</p>

<p><strong>Box/instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Foil package, in an appealing&nbsp;blue color (azure, I think). No&nbsp;instructions, just a sheet showing each of the minifigures of series 17.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>There are some really nice parts in this set - the hat, which is the same mold as the hat in the&nbsp;CITY &quot;Fun in the park&quot; set from last year, but now features a red stripe all&nbsp;around.</p>

<p>The hot dog bun is a useful and quite rare piece, and the dark red hot dog looks way more realistic than the traditional red ones. The white&nbsp;milkshake&nbsp;and serving tray are exclusive to this set, I believe. Few CMF:s come with more than&nbsp;one or two&nbsp;accessories, so this is a welcome change. <em>However</em>, there&nbsp;are no studs on the tray to place any foodstuff, which has been criticized in previous reviews.&nbsp;Actually, it doesn&#39;t bug me at all,&nbsp;because the tray looks&nbsp;better in&nbsp;person without&nbsp;any&nbsp;exposed studs.&nbsp;On the underside is an inverted stud&nbsp;for a minifigure hand to hold on to.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The guy has a huge, geeky grin and some freckles on his face, which is generic and useful. He has dual-molded arms which is always nice, and an apron with red and white squares covers his torso and legs. He also sports a huge smiley pin, which is a fun addition&nbsp;but a little silly.</p>

<p><strong>Overall thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Despite some flaws with the serving tray, I think the Hot dog man is a very good figure with excellent accessories and a unique feel. You could easily fit him into any Lego town.</p>

<p>Overall score: 4,5 / 5</p>

<p>Featuring some great new parts, this Minifigure from Series 17 includes a new rectangular food tray, the LEGO Simpsons Squishee cup piece in plain white with a clear top, a LEGO sausage piece and, the LEGO Hot Dog Bun. This piece alone is a great new addition and allows you to finally have somewhere to stick all those sausages LEGO likes to include in sets.</p>

<p>As far as the print on this guy, he&#39;s got a nice large checker patterned apron with a big smiley face button on the front, his back features some minor printing for the shirt underneath he&#39;s also wearing the same cap as the Butcher from way back in Series 6 and features dual-molded arms for that short-sleeved look.</p>

<p>I wholeheartedly recommend this guy, he&#39;s a strong offering for folks who are looking to populate their own LEGO City MOCs and his parts are definitely a must have. You can get a lot of mileage out of the figure too, he can serve as a Restaurant employee, a Diner employee or even somebody working at the local Theater/Drive-In bringing you the food while you enjoy the picture. His big happy smile is also really fun and useful. Highly Recommended.</p>

<p>I agree with the previous and more in depth review that the tray is close to useless without&nbsp;studs to secure the Hot Dog bun or drink cup. The Mini-figure and other accessories are all top notch though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mini-Dolls from the Friends set (spit) now live in my child&#39;s&nbsp;King&#39;s Castle dungeon where they may rot for eternity :).</p>
