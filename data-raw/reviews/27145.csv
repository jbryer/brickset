<br />
Those wings! &nbsp;I mean, how awesome are those wings?! &nbsp;When I first saw the picture, I didn&#39;t really look at them, and just kind of assumed they were the bee wings from Bee Girl or Ballet Batman. &nbsp;When I saw that they were full on butterfly wings, I got more than a little giggly.<br />
<br />
For me, though, the best part is the butterfly print tank top. &nbsp;I have a clothing store MOC that is going to have one of those on a mannequin the next time I expand it. &nbsp;It&#39;s adorable.<br />
<br />
I can live with the hair piece being printed. &nbsp;It might be nice to have one like that in plain, but if I really, absolutely have to have one, there&#39;s always Brasso.<br />
<br />
This little girl is screaming for her own birthday party MOC, or as a rave girl with the addition of longer legs.</p>

<p>Wearing brightly painted Butterfly wings, which I believe is a new piece, the Butterfly Girl has a limited torso print and minor leg printing on her short LEGO legs for some kind of shoes or slippers or something.&nbsp;With some cute flower markings on her hair and cheek and carrying a LEGO bouquet element, the Butterfly Girl is a fun little addition from Series 17, however not one of the stronger offerings.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re aiming to have a complete set, or want those new wings for a MOC then I&#39;d recommend picking her up. If you aren&#39;t too impressed with cute costumes and adorable children dressed up I feel you&#39;d be better off skipping her. Recommended.</p>
