This is either a Retarius or a Laquerius. &nbsp;I favour&nbsp;Retarius, as they are more recognizable, but without a net (and possibly a short dagger), I can&#39;t be certain. &nbsp;That is, until I give him a net. &nbsp;Or give him a rope or Spiderman web, and make him&nbsp;a Laquerius.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s good to have another type of Gladiator for Roman Games MOCs or my History Museum (or both). &nbsp;As a history buff, I was super excited to see this guy, and he was in the first batch of five I was allowed to buy.<br />
<br />
Oh, great! &nbsp;So now I have to buy two more, and Bricklink a net and a rope/web.<br />

Hey, TLG! &nbsp;Psst! &nbsp;Myrmillo and Velitus&nbsp;next, please.</p>

<p>Read my review for the Highwayman if you want an in depth look at the packaging: <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/51833"">https://brickset.com/reviews/51833</a></p>

<p>No build or completed model categories, so I&rsquo;m going to add a new one: quality.</p>

<p>QUALITY</p>

<p>CMFs tend to be made out of different plastics than the minifigures in sets. Sometime that different plastic can seem slightly transparent and lower quality, but I&rsquo;m not sure that it really is lower quality. CMFs, in my experience don&rsquo;t crack nearly as often as regular minifigures. I think I&rsquo;ve had maybe two crack in thirty or so that I&rsquo;ve gotten and even that was after some pretty rough treatment. The Gladiator&rsquo;s plastic doesn&rsquo;t have the transparent look and the printing and dual molding is excellent. I&rsquo;m sure you could find some flaws if you looked at him through a microscope, but his printing is beyond satisfactory, in my opinion.</p>

<p>OVERALL</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this minifigure. He&rsquo;s way different than the Series 5 one, so I don&rsquo;t feel like he&rsquo;s a copy and he looks great! My only problem is this: why didn&rsquo;t we get a new mini-net, maybe styled like the vine piece? (or Spidey&rsquo;s web, depending on the color) That would have made him A++, but since he didn&rsquo;t he just gets an A+. I especially like his dual molded arm that represents should armor, though I&rsquo;m not sure why it&rsquo;s gold on his arm and brown on his torso. The print of the lion on the gold armor looks superb, as does the wristband print.</p>

<p>His hair is nice to get as well, as it is currently exclusive and may remain that way. I also really appreciate the change of plastic for the trident. When I was younger, my brother and I were really into the Atlantis sets. We had probably 50% of the sets and most of them had undersea warriors who wielded tridents. The problem with those tridents was the fact that they were rather rubbery, so after clipping them in and out of the minifigure&rsquo;s hands multiple times&nbsp; they wouldn&rsquo;t stick as well because some of the rubbery plastic had flaked off. Lego has remedied that with the newer tridents by changing the plastic to a harder one. Moving on. His face is mostly good. A little derpy perhaps, but still good nonetheless. The legs are excellent: dual molding plus printing.</p>

<p>FINAL VERDICT</p>

<p>Usefulness: 9/10. He&rsquo;ll fit great in any Roman/Greek MOC.</p>

<p>Quality: 10/10. Another gem!</p>

<p>Usefulness of Doubles: 6/10. Switch the head and/or hair and you&rsquo;re good to go!</p>

<p>Overall: 10/10. Yes, I know that I gave the Highwayman a lower rating even though I like him better than the Gladiator, but the only flaw here is lack of a net!</p>

<p>Now, go buy him! Quick, before the next series pushes him out of the store!! Oh, and if it isn&rsquo;t obvious: feel for the trident.</p>

<p>Wait! I forgot to mention: since this guy is so cool, he earned a name. Please welcome: Claudius the Retiarius!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2018-04-18T17:05:18.59Z","When in Rome, engage in Gladiatorial Combat.","<p><strong>Set #71018 Roman Gladiator:</strong> This is not the first time we&#39;ve had a Gladiator in the CMF releases. In fact I think the original Gladiator was from way back in Series 1 or 2... actually, really think it was 2. Either way, more Historical figures aren&#39;t exactly a bad thing.</p>

<p>This Gladiator uses Finn&#39;s hair piece in a nice brown colour, he carries a trident into battle and is using dual-molded lags for his unique foot wear look. The rest of him is covered in detailed printing showcasing some armour that would be completely impractical if you wanted to survive. But for looking like what Hollywood says Gladiators dressed as it fits as well as can be expected. He&#39;s got a really nice lion symbol on his arm though, which makes me think this is meant to be somebody specific, though I have no idea who... perhaps Spartacus?</p>

<p>Like with most Historical figures I recommend tracking this down if you missed it initially to have some more options for your display and collection. And as with some of them I say he can be safely skipped over if you aren&#39;t aiming to complete the entire set of 16 Minifigures from the series. Recommended.</p>
