<br />
However, I do get a new top to use around town, and a face, too.<br />
<br />
The bread is good. &nbsp;I like the bread. &nbsp;Maybe the Bricklink price will stay kinda low on them, should I ever decide to build a Bakery MOC.<br />
<br />
But that Frenchie! &nbsp;Squee! &nbsp;I would have bought this one no matter what it was to get that Frenchie! &nbsp;<br />
<br />
TLG, you&#39;ve got a lot of dogs out now. &nbsp;Generic mutts, chihuahuas, German Sheppards, and West Highland White Terriers. &nbsp;May I please ask for Sheepdogs, British Bulldogs, Akitas&nbsp;and Great Danes?</p>

That&#39;s what some folks think of this Minifigure, I, however, look at him and see more of a stereotype than I&#39;d care to. From the baguette in his hand to the large red necktie/scarf deal and the French Beret I think of this guy as truly a non-PC figure.</p>

<p>If it weren&#39;t for the new animal piece included with him I&#39;d feel like LEGO may have made a slight mistake in releasing someone like him. He&#39;s wearing a black and white striped shirt also, not to be confused with a LEGO City prisoner costume, this is another element of the stereotypical French Connoisseur.</p>

<p>Am I being too harsh with this Review? do forgive me, but honestly, this is one of the weakest offerings from Series 17, sure the dog is a great addition to LEGO animals, much like the Rabbit, but this figure is somewhat bland, perpetuates a Stereotype that Hollywood made popular in French comedies, though I&#39;m certain it&#39;s been around longer than that, and it just feels like a step in the wrong direction for LEGO. Of course my French-Canadian side may be a bit biased towards this figure, do forgive me.</p>

<p>I would recommend him for the novelty alone I suppose, if it doesn&#39;t bother you too badly. Also the dog is a great new piece and just as cute as the rabbit or the little Chihuahua Series 10 introduced for us. Somewhat recommended.</p>

"Brickstarr","2018-04-19T17:20:15.7Z","BONJOUR!!!","<p>Today&nbsp;I will be reviewing the collectible minifigure connoisseur ( set 71018-9) he comes with 6 pieces and retailed for &pound;3 or $4.</p>

<p>I will just say this is probably my favorite LEGO minifigure ever,&nbsp;I just love the way he looks.</p>

<p>He comes with black trousers and a shirt that is black and white and is striped and has a red cravat. He has a puzzled face with a curly mustache and a black beret. The accessories he comes with are a pug and a delicious looking baguette.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope it was helpful :-)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I definitely recommend this figure.&nbsp; Sure, he might be a stereotypical French guy, but all of the mini-figures are stereotypical in a sense.&nbsp; That&#39;s the whole point.&nbsp; This is a very neat figure.</p>

<p>The connoisseur is a fun figure that was my most wanted of the series .&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The figure has a hat which is nice and can work when facing other directions , a face with fine moustache and a peculiar mouth , a nice torso with finely printed arms and the end suffer from the same problem as the professional surfer of the series as the are as plain as possible being unprinted .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>His accessories include a non exclusive but very nice baguette and a French blog which was a new piece for the time . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a figure I yearned for back in 2017 but today me prefers the rocket not figure but I still do quite like it a bit more than the other 3 below so I recommend it .</p>
