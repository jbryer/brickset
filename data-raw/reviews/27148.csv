<br />
Red mohawk. &nbsp;Great on the dwarf, and good for more punks, or Space Marines.<br />
<br />
Same goes for the beautiful red beard.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The handlebar mustachioed head may become my new sig fig, if I ever quit my&nbsp;job and can grow my facial hair my way. &nbsp;It would also be perfectly suited to any macho-man minifigure. &nbsp;Put the Piper&#39;s kilt on him, give him a broadsword, and get yourself some Highlands mayhem.<br />
<br />
The legs are a bit Bart Simpson for my taste. &nbsp;I think maybe more detailing would be in order. &nbsp;But even if you put longer legs on him, you have an awesome berseker. &nbsp;A berserker with killer ink on his arm that runs to his chest, making a pretty sweet dragon.</p>

<p>This guy is going to fit well into your old Castle Fantasy sets (or some new ones... psst! &nbsp;TLG! &nbsp;Yea, laddies, I&#39;m talking to you.).<br />

<p>Its appearance is quite unique, thanks to the detailed torso, beard and Mohawk haircut. Its axe is not that special, but I believe the war-hammer is not so common. I&#39;m personally not a huge fan of the short legs, but it&#39;s a dwarf after all so no complaints from me.</p>

<p>As for theme compatibility, not only does the Battle Dwarf fit well with any Castle theme, it also fits well with the old Viking theme back from 2005. For parents and children creating scenarios, this little guy can fit multiple roles due to its appearance. Good guy, bad guy, everything is possible. Its war-hammer also resembles a blacksmith tool, sort of, so I guess those that have any of the old Blacksmith sets could also promote this little guy as a black smith. Would fit the theme of a dwarf being skilled with tools well too.</p>

<p>To be honest, I think the 8805 Evil Dwarf does a better job in&nbsp;looking like a generic dwarf to fit well with the Dwarf theme sets from the Castle 2007&nbsp;series. However, the Battle Dwarf is a lot more unique and therefore perhaps better value for money. Those wanting additional regular dwarves would be better off with 852702 Dwarf Warrior Battle Pack anyway.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, it&#39;s a nice purchase, especially for those who love&nbsp;medieval sets.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2018-04-19T01:11:16.42Z","More decent fantasy ideas incorporated into a fun figure.","<p><strong>Set #71018 Battle Dwarf: </strong>Another Fantasy character, and another Dwarf, this time using some interesting part combinations and featuring dual-molded legs.</p>

<p>Battle Dwarf features a nice bare chested muscular torso print with dual-sided printing and a boar faced belt buckle on the front. This symbol is also printed on either side of his hammer accessory and he has dual-molded arms with side printing on one side for part of the dragon tattoo visible on his chest. He&#39;s also got an axe weapon, a red version of the mohawk piece and a nice red beard element.</p>

<p>Overall this is another fun character and a huge improvement over the Connoisseur. I&#39;d definitely recommend him, actually I believe this is the first time Mjolnir has featured printing on it, that&#39;s an interesting idea I hope we see more of, and now that we have the Evil Dwarf and Battle Dwarf to do battle against one another, can we possibly see a female dwarf in the future? Recommended.</p>

"Quietman113","2020-05-13T16:07:55.34Z","He's taken the Slayer Oath","<p>This was a delightful surprise to see Lego make a minifigure that is so clearly inspired by the miniatures war game Warhammer. In Warhammer dwarfs take oaths super seriously so when one breaks an oath they seek redemption by taking the Slayer Oath, they dye their hair red and go into battle wearing no armor and seek out opponents to fight until one can finally slay the dwarf in battle. This set nails the details so well, the red mohawk and beard, the tattoo&nbsp;and&nbsp;the dual wielding weapons. It is so good that I am legitimately using this minifig in Warhammer as a dwarf slayer model.</p>
