"redbeardlegoman","2017-05-27T04:38:38.753Z","Buck Gordon!  Flash Rogers!  Guardian of the Universe!","<p>When the first CMF line came out, I built a MOC of an old serial film shoot of the Spaceman taking on a small horde of the Robots with those excellent bucket heads.<br />
<br />
My only lament was that, as dashing as Captain Spacelord (yes, that&#39;s what I named him, shut up!) was, he wasn&#39;t exactly the kind of retro-tastic&nbsp;spacefarer that I was hoping for.<br />
<br />
Seven years later my prayers have been answered! &nbsp;And I honestly don&#39;t think there could be a more perfect generic 30s sci-fi&nbsp;figure. &nbsp;This has EVERYTHING it should have.<br />
<br />
Outlandish helmet! &nbsp;Nonsensical bolts! &nbsp;Superfluous cape! &nbsp;Lighting bolt and outdated atomic model motif! &nbsp;Quasi-military colours! &nbsp;Cleft chin!<br />
<br />
But nothing tops that ray gun. &nbsp;I love the ray gun from Series 1, but this one is the clear successor - and I shall name it the Pew-Pew Mark II.<br />
<br />
My movie set MOC will be rebuilt, with Cleft Thunderplank&nbsp;as Buck Gordon, guarding the universe from the Evil Robot Armada! &nbsp;Stay tuned, Junior Guardians!</p>

"Max_Bricks","2017-09-03T15:37:07.057Z","Best Space Themed Collectible Mini-Figure So Far!","<p>As soon as Lego released a picture of this series I knew I had to get my hands on this mini-figure. So I&nbsp;went to Brick Fest&nbsp;in June and I went to one of the shops. When I went to the shop I saw that they had this mini-figure. I bought this mini-figure&nbsp;for a great price and I knew it wouldn&#39;t disappoint me.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Retro Spaceman&nbsp;comes with a great helmet with horns on it and also a cool laser gun. It is also nice to see this mini-figure&nbsp;comes with duel&nbsp;molded arms and legs. I also love the olive green color that is on his torso. The face of the Retro Spaceman looks awesome with a chin beard and a big smile. It is also nice to see a different colored cape.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>I feel that their is no problem with this mini-figure what so ever.</p>

<p>In conclusion I feel the Retro Spaceman is the &nbsp;best space themed mini-figure made to date because it comes with a lot of exclusive of pieces and once put together it looks amazing. I totally recommend to buy this mini-figure and it&#39;s one of my favorites of all time for Collectable Mini-Figures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Retro Spaceman features some impressive level of detailing, he&#39;s got dual-molded legs and arms with side printing and some fun old-school sci-fi serial based space armor. He also comes with a yellow cape, a fancy new ray gun accessory and a funky looking helmet. This is a great looking figure because of all the classic nods to the science fiction serials of the 40&#39;s and 50&#39;s.</p>

<p>Love the overall look of him and highly recommend this one for fans of LEGO Classic Space era figures. Highly Recommended.</p>

"LegoHobbitFan","2018-11-30T16:12:37.75Z","Retro Spaceman","<p>To start off, a little back round on this character. He is the 11th figure in thr Collectable minifigure series 17, and there are 4 copies of him in each box of 60 figures, so he isn&#39;t too hard to find. He is a very detailed figure, with no misprints and extreme attention to detail. His legs are dual-molded. The top of his legs are sand green, and the bottom is dark bley,&nbsp;giving the appearance of boots. There are also some Orange stripes printed in between the 2 colors, which even extend onto the sides of the legs.&nbsp;His torso is sand green as well, and has quite a few details which are visible in the image. His arms are dual molded, and they match the legs with sand green at the top, dark bley at the bottom, and Orange stripes in between. There is Also a really cool symbol printed on the sand green portion of his arms. His face is absolutely perfect, with an huge&nbsp;grin, which I absolutely love. His helmet is Also very detailed, with yellow antenna- thingies sticking out of the sides and a yellow crest down the middle. He also comes with a yellow cape which is made of a soft fabric, so can be bent with no consequences. He also comes with an awesome new ray-gun which only appears in this color in this set, although it appears&nbsp; with a couple other figures in different colors. Overall, this is a great figure with&nbsp;lots of detail who would be great for both play and display! I highly recommend him, and hope you find this review helpful.</p>
