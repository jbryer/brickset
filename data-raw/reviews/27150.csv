"Odeinoichus","2018-04-19T01:24:20.447Z","Welcome to Miami Vice.","<p><strong>Set #71018 Yuppie:</strong> I have no idea why they chose that for his name, I honestly grew up in the 80&#39;s, but I can&#39;t for the life of me remember much about such slang terms. So I also don&#39;t know if it&#39;s really, really offensive somehow.</p>

<p>This figure is great, with dual-molded arms for that short-sleeve look and the great white suite with pink undershirt look that was quite common in the 80&#39;s, the only thing missing is the mullet, or a male ponytail. He&#39;s got a pair of printed parts to attach to the LEGO walkie talkie piece to make an old school cell phone. This is what they looked like before folks engineered the new streamlined look. With some cool shades and a funky looking hair style, the Yuppie is a great nostalgic trip back in time.</p>

<p>The yuppie is a type of individual who I was previously uneducated of but iridescent figure gets the idea across .&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The hair piece is quite bland just being the BVS superman hair , the face has a confident smirk with shades , the torso is nice and has dual moulded arms with more printing and the legs are fine .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>His accessory is an old style phone using a light grey walkie talkie with a printed 1&times;1 cheese slope and a printed 1&times;1 tile which work very well . The stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a good but not revolutionary Minifigure with nothing wrong except maybe a more interesting hair colour although I still recommend it .</p>
