Rocket Boy looked to be the best of the series 17 CMF&#39;s, so I had high expectations. Read on to see if he lives up to the high standard...</p>

<h2>the Minifigure:</h2>

<p>The rocket-costume is great, the rivets and red highlights are really nice touches to complete the cartoonish look. But that&#39;s nothing compared to what&#39;s underneath...... A torso printed with the Classic Space logo in Light Bluish Grey for the FIRST TIME!!! NCS(neo-classic space) lovers will go nuts over this, being in one of their main color choices for their MOC&#39;s. And finally, we have the accessory: a flag printed on both sides with a (slightly scribbly)Hand-drawn Classic Space logo, with some stars around it. The flag is probably my favorite part. I just love the way it&#39;s looks like someone actually drew it.</p>

<h2>Searching Tips:</h2>

<p>Feel for the rocket-costume (careful that it isn&#39;t corn cob guy&#39;s suit. His suit is knobbly, while rocket boy&#39;s is smooth), you&#39;ll know it buy the fins on the bottom and the ball at the top. You can confirm it by feeling for the flag or the pole.</p>

<h2>Overall Opinion:</h2>

<p>Rocket boy is an awesome minifigure. I would say he&#39;s the best of series 17! If you decide to get any one of the series 17 CMF&#39;s, I would recommend Rocket Boy!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2018-04-19T01:36:37.79Z","Rocket TO THE MOON!","<p><strong>Set #71018 Rocket Boy:</strong> More costumed characters from Series 17, this time this little boy is dressed up as a rocket ship.</p>

<p>The rocket ship costume has a lot of fun details, there&#39;s rivets running all the way around and some red markings on the fuselage. Underneath the costume this character has a grey outfit, a grey version of the classic LEGO Spaceman shirt with darker grey short legs. For accessories he comes with a printed homemade flag piece that shows the classic Space logo as drawn by the child.</p>

<p>Overall this is one of the strongest figures in the set and a must have for Classic Space fans. It&#39;s also great for MOC enthusiasts who want to use that torso for their Classic Space collection. Strongly recommended.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>All in all</strong>,&nbsp;he is a young astronaut like many adults wanted to be if they were young during the space&nbsp;race. good mold, print, and torso.</p>
