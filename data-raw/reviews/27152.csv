She also looks like she&#39;d be great friends with the Series 5 Fitness Instructor.</p>

<p>Dance Instructor is wearing a one-piece leotard in hot pink with some zany highlights, her legs are dual-molded with some zebra print leggings on the top and plain teal boots. Her arms feature sweat bands printed on the wrists and she also has a headband under her outrageous hair piece, two pieces combine to make a nice water bottle accessory too.</p>

<p>As&nbsp;a child of the 80&#39;s and a huge fan of anything nostalgic concerning it I wholeheartedly recommend this figure if you missed her out or share my views on such things. Also her parts look stunning and really great. Highly recommended.</p>
