<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>She has some excellent body pieces, a good head print, and a new hairpiece and a nice shield- the least impressive piece is her sword, but that&#39;s still nice!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>She&#39;s beautiful. Her new hair is similar to the Legolas piece, but with a feminine center part, a much wavier texture, and a silver flower ornament on the braid on the back. It&#39;s in dark nougat, a relatively rare hair color, and it includes her pointy ears- painted, not dual-molded. Her face is suitably elvish, with cheekbones and a wise or determined expression. Her body pieces steal the show, though. Her dress is primarily light blue, but has beautiful printed details in <em>metallic</em>&nbsp;blue, which I haven&#39;t seen them do before. There&#39;s a lavender layer underneath with metallic&nbsp;silver, and some great armor detail along the collar and shoulders, with metallic silver and yellow dual-mold arms--printed for more detail. She comes with the classic shield piece with a new print and a golden broadsword. I just love that she&#39;s a warrior, not a mage or priestess like so many female elves tend to be.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>She&#39;s a great figure on her own or as a companion to the Series 3 Elf, and any fantasy world would be remiss to leave her out.</p>

Or a new Elven character?","<p><strong>Set #71018 Elf Girl:</strong> It would appear that LEGO has finally decided to give the Series 3 Elf a female companion, which unfortunately doesn&#39;t entirely match the colour scheme of the original Elf. The Forest Maiden matched better as far as colouring goes, that being said here&#39;s a great looking Minifigure.</p>

<p>Holding a golden sword and elegantly printed shield piece with a floral standard in gold with blue backing, this warrior of the forest is prepared to defend her Elven home from intruders. The sloped brick element is printed quite beautifully with a very nice dress pattern matching up with her torso; which uses the dual-molded arms quite impressively for some silver upper cuffs with delectate armour engravings which match her silver printed pauldron looking thing on the front and leaves her arms bare.</p>

<p>Her hair is delicately molded with some nice braid detailing and silver printed clasp. I&#39;m not entirely certain if this is a re-use from The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit parts, but if it is it is nice to see it in this colour. (I&#39;m leaning more towards this being a new style of hair though as the front bangs do not match what I recall of any of the elves from LotR/Hobbit.)</p>

<p>One of my favorites from the line and a definite highly recommended from me.</p>

"Ernst","2018-05-22T08:58:19.963Z","The Elf Girl; for Castle, LOTR and other historic fans.","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks :</strong> I kind of gave up collecting the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Collectable-Minifigures"">CMF&#39;s</a> since I rather spent my money on regular new or older sets but I always try to keep my eyes open for &quot;Middle Age&quot; figures. This Elf Girl is such a figure so I&#39;m happy I could add this one to my collection. Cute for kids, great for people who make MOC&#39;s and nice to own one.</p>

<p><strong>Building 1 brick :</strong> The easiest job there is : assemble a mini figure.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks : </strong>The dress and torso are in a great design but the best parts are those you can exchange with other figures like the head, the golden sword, the shield and the hair piece. You can change her into a &quot;normal&quot; girl and turn other girls into Elfs. The shield is also a great unique part.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 3 bricks :</strong> It gets this value when added to other Elf mini figures and sets or when used in MOC&#39;s.</p>

<p><strong>Value 3 bricks :</strong> The normal price of some &euro; 3,00 is standard for a CMF.</p>
