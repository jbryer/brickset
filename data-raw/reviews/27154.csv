Let me be the first on Brickset to say that this figure is AWESOME!!! The prints are really detailed, the pieces are great to get, including the hat, gunmetal gray guns, bandana, and new(?) cape. There&#39;s nothing bad I can say about this figure, aside from the fact that even though it&#39;s the best of the series in my opinion, I can&#39;t say I agree with the hype this was given by Lego. Regardless, it&#39;s still a great figure that you should try to look for if you go hunting for series 17.</p>

"Mytybizar","2017-04-22T01:24:54.43Z","Awesome Figure!","<p>I was lucky enough to feel this figure on my 3rd try lol... The hat was a dead giveaway followed by the two guns. Amazing detail on torso, dual molded legs, and amazing arm printing! I had him put together before my car was in drive... Only downside was that the cape has a bend in it... would have been nice if it was packaged like the capes that come in sets but I guess that would give it away too easily. Not sure why there is the secrecy surrounding this figure but it is far and away the best looking of the entire series</p>

Anyway, here&#39;s the final Series 17 Minifigure, why they decided upon this Minifigure to be the &#39;mystery&#39; figure is anybodies guess. I&#39;m not sure I buy into the ridiculous notion of having a &#39;mystery&#39; figure to track down.</p>

<p>The Highwayman is one of the more detailed figures out of the series, he includes dual-molded legs with upper thigh printing for his jacket. His arms include side printing for the sleeve cuffs matching the style of this historical era of English Gentry or the like, and his torso is nicely printed with a single-sided deco of the jacket and undershirt and large belt buckle.</p>

<p>His hat, pistols and mask are not new pieces, they&#39;ve all been used previously in LEGO Pirates or Ninjago, but the cape element is a new style with added bits which stick out in front and are meant to give the illusion of the larger capes worn in style back around this era in human history. I want to say sixteenth century, but I was never great on historical dates.</p>

<p>The only downside for this figure is just how silly it was to keep him as a &#39;mystery&#39; figure. He&#39;s ok, but nowhere near as exciting as Mr. Gold or the new Classic Town Cop in Series 18. Had LEGO truly wanted to capture the &#39;mystery&#39; element of blind bagged figures they should have aimed for something a bit more exciting. As it stands, the Highwayman is what it is, a nicely done historical era Minifigure. I somewhat recommend him, mostly for the rare flintlock pistols in almost chrome black colours.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>We get the standard style of&nbsp;packaging for a blind bag from LEGO. For parts we get 2 flintlock pistols in gunmetal grey and a nicely printed torso and leg piece. We also get a trench coat like draping for a cape piece too and a typical tricone hat from the LEGO pirates series. We also get a checklist for the series which also includes simple instructions for the assembly of the figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p>We get a great figure here. The face print is nice and detailed giving the figure an appropriately&nbsp;crooked look. The ruffles on the collar the belt buckle the dual molded legs and the printing on the arms round out the look. He also gets a face cover so he is not as easily identified when robbing carts on the road.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>This is a great figure. I highly recommend it, specially if you like historical or period pieces. I am not sure what the distribution rate&nbsp;is for him per box but he is worth the hunt.</p>

<p>Speaking of distribution rate&nbsp;I had intended to review two of these today so I&nbsp;just grabbed and bought 2 bags at random at the store and headed home. Interestingly when I got home and opened my small haul I had gotten two of these guys. Lucky me! I might make one female by swapping the head on one so my highwayman is not alone =)&nbsp;</p>

"FowlerBricks","2017-05-26T00:31:14.823Z","The Mystery Man Is Here!","<p>So, here he is at last: The Highwayman! The most controversial minifigure of Series 17. We all still have questions: Why did series 17 have a mystery guy? Why the Highwayman as the mystery guy? Why a Highwayman at all? I can&rsquo;t answer any of these questions, so instead we&rsquo;ll take an in depth look at him and I&rsquo;ll tell you what I think of him.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/627enwndf/H01.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>I got this guy at my local Walmart which is well known for having extremely low Minifigure stocks (my local Walmart that is, not Walmart in general). They had sold out of the TLBM minifigures a week or so before, and that allowed them to get Series 17 early. Naturally, I went and got a few (The Highwayman and the Roman Gladiator. Review coming soon). The Highwayman is not an easy find, since his only large pieces is a cape made of cloth that you can&rsquo;t really feel through the package. His hat and pistols are the items to feel for.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE BOX/INSTRUCTIONS</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blue packaging that seems suspiciously close to Series 5&hellip;come to think of it, there are other similarities to Series 5, but I&rsquo;ll get to that later. The foldout checklist is nicely designed, as always. The front shows all the Series 17 minifigures (minus the Highwayman, who remains but a shadow) &nbsp;and the back shows how to build some of the more complex minifigures. It also shows the Corn Man with his costume being stolen and the caption &ldquo;who stole my corn?&rdquo;and a link to the minifigures website.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE BUILD</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Okay, who put this category in a minifigure review? Fast forward.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE COMPLETED MODEL</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hmm&hellip;fast forward again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>OVERALL</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Before I get to the nitpicky stuff, I&rsquo;m going to say: THIS MINIFIGURE ROCKS!! There are multiple reasons why he rocks. #1: one of the few Colonial era minifigures. #2: he reminds me of the main character from Beyond The Mask (an amazing movie. Look it up on Amazon or wherever you go to watch movies) #3: the new cloak piece is really neat and it&rsquo;s nice to be able to get the silver pistols without going broke. #4: excellent printing paired with dual molded legs is a recipe for awesomeness!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/tyajfouvn/H05.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Now on to the nitpicky stuff. Series 17 has many similar minifigures to Series 5: Gladiator, Exercise Lady and Dwarf. That could annoy some people but now we have another Gladiator to do battle with Series 5 Gladiator and another Dwarf to befriend/fight the Series 5 Dwarf. So maybe that&rsquo;s not so nitpicky after all and it doesn&rsquo;t really have anything to do with the Highwayman. Moving on. The secrecy confuses me but it was probably just for fun. Now, an entire mystery series would be neat (hint hint Lego). The back of the Highwayman&rsquo;s head is rather bare and I&rsquo;ve heard some people say that Lego should have printed hair on.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/bhg4ovexf/H04.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.cc/qnm6ft4yb/H02.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>In my opinion printed hair (minus beards) looks strange and a dual molded hat/hair piece would have suited better (the hat being dark brown and the hair being black). But, Lego didn&#39;t do that and I can easily overlook that one puny detail.</p>

<p>FINAL VERDICT</p>

<p>Usefulness: 9/10. He&rsquo;ll fit nicely into pirate theme or steampunk and colonial MOC&rsquo;s (hopefully we&rsquo;ll get a colonial theme soon).</p>

<p>Quality: 10/10</p>

<p>Usefulness Of Doubles: 2/10. Your wallet is shouting for joy!</p>

<p>Overall: 9/10. A few minor flaws, but in the end, excellent.</p>

<p>Whenever I really like a Mystery Minifigure, I&rsquo;ll give him a name, so please welcome: Dillon O&rsquo;Reilly, scourge of the open road!</p>

<p>Definitely worth picking up!</p>
