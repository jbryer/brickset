<p>The set is like all magazine gift sets in the sense that they do not have any instructions which makes it all the more fun. After i built it i checked a youtube video about it just to see if my guess was right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a fun little build and to only function is that the wings can move forwards for an emergency break that is space would rip the wings off :)</p>

<p>Over all i think this is a fun &#39;lil set but i feel like it has been made before....</p>
