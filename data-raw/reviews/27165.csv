"MrSensible","2017-11-06T05:35:05.173Z","A brick-built Santa for 2017","<p>As a longtime fan of various seasonal LEGO sets (and a sucker for cheap polybags), I was very happy to find <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/30478-1/Santa-Claus"">30478: Santa Claus</a> at my local Target recently for USD$3.49. I prefer to do my seasonal decorating in bricks, and these festive little guys are crucial to the cause. Sets like this are great for adding a tiny dash of holiday flair to a room and obviously make perfect stocking stuffers for nearly any kid or AFOL.</p>

<p>While not as large or detailed as last year&#39;s <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40206-1/Santa"">40206: Santa</a>, this&nbsp;smaller&nbsp;set still packs in a lot of character (and was less than half the retail price). It&#39;s a standing model of the jolly man himself, sporting his trademark sack of toys slung across his back, as well as three loose gifts for extra props. The figure evokes memories of any number of similarly simple brick-built Santas released in prior years, such as <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/30182-1/Santa"">30182</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10068-1/Santa"">10068</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/1978-1/Santa-Claus"">1978</a>,&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/1555-1/Santa-Claus"">1555</a>.</p>

<p>At only seventy-three pieces, there&#39;s not much to say about the build itself&nbsp;other than that it doesn&#39;t take much time to complete. There&#39;s a decent spread of different colors among the limited number of parts, although this&nbsp;set obviously&nbsp;leans toward red and white elements. Like some other brick-built figures, Santa does have a couple of structural&nbsp;weak points that make the figure&nbsp;less suited for playability, and in this case it&#39;s his fragile little feet that tend to snap off at their one-stud-wide ankles. Otherwise he&#39;s ready to deliver presents across the globe or across the living room.</p>

<p>In short, the low cost combined with inherent holiday appeal make this set easy to recommend.</p>

"Minifig290","2018-12-24T00:46:16.77Z","Jolly Build for Jolly Santa","<p>Hello and a Merry Christmas to all, today I&nbsp;will be taking a look at the 2017 Jolly Santa polybag that contains 74 parts and was available&nbsp;from Walmart for $4 or in the UK from Hamleys for &pound;8 but later one at The Entertainer for a more reasonable price of &pound;4. Going on te &pound;4/$4 price this set has a price per price of 5p/c. Let&rsquo;s loom at this jolly fellow.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>There are 5&nbsp;builds for this set, Santa and his sack and 3 presents, We&rsquo;ll look at Santa first.</p>

<p>Santa&rsquo;s legs are identically built using an inverted slope and a few plates with a black 1x1 tile. His body is 3 studs by 3 using plates to show his belt and some sloped parts to give a smooth transition from his head to belly and two arms that have black gloves on.</p>

<p>Santa&rsquo;s head is a simple build based around two pieces a tan 1x2 brick with studs on one side and a 2x2 white plate with studs on 1 side holding Santa&rsquo;s Beard and two printed 1x1 tile eyes.&nbsp;His hat uses two red jumper plates and a sloped brick with a white stud on the end. Santa does not have any articulation sadly.</p>

<p>On the back of Santa is a clip that holds his brown sack, the sack uses mostly brown bricks and plates including a 1x1 brick with a handle clip to connect with the clip on Santa.</p>

<p>Finally there are 3 presents that are all built using 3 1x2 plates with the middle being white and the other plates being either Orange, Green or Pink. Sadly these don&rsquo;t go into Santa&rsquo;s sack.</p>

<p>______________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Jolly Santa is a great model to display on your tree if you add a LEGO&nbsp;whip piece&nbsp;but as a figure it lacks in any articulation and his sack can not&nbsp;fit any of the gifts. I do like the overall look of Santa though and the sack and presents are nice little extras.</p>

<p>The build is extremely simple to build, and would make a great little stocking filler this Christmas.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Inexpensive set, great overall look and is simple to build, easy stocking filler</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>Lacking in any articulation</p>

<p>(I wish you all a Happy Holidays and a happy new year</p>

<p>Merry Christmas From Minifig290)</p>

"SleeplesSSP","2021-11-22T03:38:26.56Z","Looking for a Santa? Start here.","<p>As the holiday season fast-approaches, you&#39;re probably scouring the Christmas section for decoration and gift ideas. While this little beauty won&#39;t go as cheap as the $4 it did during retail, it&#39;s by far one of my favourite santas, with a close-second being 10068.</p>

<p>While 2002&#39;s set 10068 aimed for a more jolly, rosy-cheeked Santa with a big bag of toys and happy little wave, 2017&#39;s aims for a more Lego-centric contemporary Creator look, with the large Mixel-styled eyes and a less pose-able model. For lack of a better description, this set has almost no articulation or playability, but is the best-looking Santa you&#39;ll get if you want that authentic Lego look.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build process is nice, I&#39;m always a fan of any set that uses the sloped pieces as seen on his belly, and the general lack of exposed studs adds to an all-around sleek and smooth look, with a building process more interesting than just stacking blocks in the general shape of the old man.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a cheap one to buy online, this might be your best bet, especially when the 2021 Sleigh set is going for as much as it is.</p>
