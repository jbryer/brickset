I don&#39;t. I bought this set in the reduced area of Asda&nbsp;(UK version of Walmart) and I like to review every set I build. So, keep that in mind and sorry in advance if I don&#39;t understand much about Friends (I stick to Star Wars and Ninjago). This is the first ever Friends set I have got/bought.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions</p>

<p>As I said, this was in the reduced area so the box was a little bit battered. It&#39;s approximately the size of a Star Wars Battle Pack box. The instructions were folded (grrr) making it a little bit hard to read. Also, the bags were all non-recyclable.</p>

<p>Minifigs</p>

<p>The set has Stephanie (?) and a puppy. Stephanie has a bow in her hair and a one-side printed torso. The puppy also can hold a bow in its head hair.</p>

<p>Build</p>

<p>In my opinion, this build is quite bizarre. The bed is nice but has a sticker. A poster on the wall also has a sticker along with a dialogue clock. A gold trophy is nice but who has a golf course in their room? The puppy also has a kennel but why would it be in her bedroom? A printed phone is on a stand and the golf course can swivel round. It took approximately 15 minutes to build, with no difficulty.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The gold trophy is nice and the baby blue hairbrush and phone are cool. It includes a window and an awesome water bottle. It also has a draw. The colours are the usual spectrum of purple, yellow, baby blue and baby pink, and white.</p>

<p>Price</p>

<p>The price I got it for was &pound;1.60 ($2.09). Any set with this price is&nbsp;just dying to be&nbsp;bought, so I got the last&nbsp;2.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Nice parts</p>

<p>-Cool dog</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-Golf course in a bedroom</p>

<p>-Kennel in a bedroom</p>

<p>-Stickers (don&#39;t know if Friends fans appreciate stickers but Star Wars definitely don&#39;t!)</p>

<p>Overall, to a boy Star Wars fan, there is nothing spectacularly eye catching but the price I got it for. Thanks for reading and check out my Star Wars reviews.</p>
