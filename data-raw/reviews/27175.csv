<p>Workman wheelbarrow is the only Lego city magazine promo I have and I think it&#39;s quite good .</p>

<p>The Minifigures-</p>

<p>The minifigure is nice but nothing revolutionary I suppose the most interesting part is his dual moulded hard hat headphones .&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The &quot;build&quot; is an always nice wheelbarrow , 3 dark blueish grey 1&times;2 masonry bricks , a broom , a jackhammer , a shovel and a pick axe .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a fairly nice magazine build but nothing too important or to get excited over .</p>
