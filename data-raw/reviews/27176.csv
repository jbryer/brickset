<p>The box is the standard Pick-a-Model blister pack with 3 compartments. The pack is now pre-populated, you do not need to fill it from the&nbsp;Pick-a-Brick wall. This may disappoint some people (particularly&nbsp;youngsters), but I usually managed to miss out some vital piece from previous Pick-a-Model sets!</p>

<p>The instructions consist of 18 steps.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are 44 pieces in total, none of which are particularly remarkable. The model costs &pound;3.99 (correct as of October 2017), this makes the price per piece 9.1p.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Guardsman is very &#39;cartoonised&#39; but instantly recognisable. There are accuracy issues - it could be argued that the buttons on the coat should be a different colour (perhaps yellow / gold), the cap is exaggerated, and they are holding a broom rather than a rifle!&nbsp;</p>

<p>But who cares - it is a fun representation of the Queen&#39;s Guard.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is a great little set, exclusive to the Lego Leicester Square store, and definitely worth picking up if you visit London.</p>
