"A_Brickset_user","2017-05-19T13:46:43.23Z","A Worthy Successor, But Doesn't Quite Fit With the Others","<p>The Fairground theme is probably my favourite theme in Lego, full stop. The combination of excellent functionality and clever design, makes for some truly outstanding sets. Both the Mixer and Ferris Wheel are some of the best sets of recent years, and now Lego have revisited the Carousel. Whether it meets the standards of the past few sets remains to be seen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There aren&#39;t actually any new molds in this set, but there are plenty of new colours. We get plenty of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6157554/plate-1x1-round-w-3-2-shaft"">these</a>, as well as 6 in white, .which I think are new. There are also a fair few of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6099483/plate-1x2-w-2-shafts-Ã¸-3-2"">these</a>,&nbsp;which despite being&nbsp;released in 2015, I haven&#39;t&nbsp;really seen since Avengers Tower. There&#39;s plenty of earth blue and I think those wheel hubs and tusk pieces are medium blue, so there&#39;s plenty of interesting colours. There&#39;s also some of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6061675/wall-element-1x4x2"">these</a> in brick yellow, plus some of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6099909/brick-w-plate-2x3x1-1-3"">these</a>, and <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6173897/design-shape-w-tube-crosshole"">this piece</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4210695/fric-fork-w-cross-hole"">this one</a> make debuts in white, while <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4599461/corner-plate-10x10"">this piece</a> debuts in green, and <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6145570/1-4-circle-tile-1x1"">this one</a> in orange. For a full analysis, I&#39;ll refer you to <a href=""http://www.newelementary.com/2017/05/lego-creator-10257-carousel.html"">New Elementary&#39;s fantastic review</a>.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to bother analysing each one individually here, so I&#39;ll just say they&#39;re all nice, civilian figures. Two complaints though - firstly, the Carousel breaks the trend of ride operators wearing orange jackets, with this one instead wearing that weird Spongebob top with excessive man-cleavage. Second, 7 figs? What&#39;s going on there Lego? Yes, it&#39;s enough to fill the Carousel, but fairs are inherently busy things!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Builds</strong></p>

<p>The build is enjoyable, and a vast number of interesting geometry techniques are used, but bag 5 is seriously draining. You&#39;ve already been building for hours, and there&#39;s literally an entire section just to build 12 detail sections, 12 wheel hub sections and 24 of those things with the tusk pieces. Now I&#39;m quite patient, build-wise, and I can handle repetition. Just the other day, I built the UCS TIE, which is so repetitive the instruction book only has about four sections and just tells you to repeat stuff. But this is an entire fifth of the build just repeating little assemblies. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s really any way around it, but it doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s a very exciting section...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s a beauty. There&#39;s no denying that. The detailing is exceptional, and it functions well. It works very similarly to the old one, with wheels and cranks up top, but runs much more smoothly thanks to the way it&#39;s driven - rather than use awkward tyres, the bottom section is fixed onto a ring of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6151167/1-4-circle-gear-rack-11x11"">these</a>, which are driven by one of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4255563/double-conical-wheel-z36"">these gears</a> on the inside. The animals themselves look great, but the selections are a bit random - sure, the Ugly Duckling turns into a beautiful swan, but if someone can point me towards Beauty and the Flamingo, I&#39;d love to read it. The &quot;storybook&quot; theme as a whole is nice, but kind of out there. And I think that&#39;s where we find this set&#39;s biggest flaw. The whole fairytale theme is great within the set, but as soon as we put this into our bigger fairground, it looks a bit out of place next to the Ferris Wheel and Mixer. While the latter two both had defined, distinct colour schemes (the Mixer with its bright, simple primary colours, and the Ferris Wheel with its more refined, mature use of secondary colours), this one&#39;s colours are a little bit of a mess. They say in design that to create a good colour scheme, one should use colours that are either opposite or right next to each other on the colour&nbsp;wheel. So for blue, that would mean orange, or green or purple. For yellow, one should use red, orange or purple. Since the blue/yellow combo meets none of these standards, to me personally it&nbsp;looks a little off, and so I think the colour scheme (and animal theme when the Carousel is situated among other fairground sets) somewhat detract from its aesthetic appeal. I think this may be due to the change in designer - while the Mixer and FW were both designed by <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/list-10590"">Jamie Berard</a>, the Carousel is the work of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/list-9961"">Mike Psiaki</a>. And while he did a wonderful&nbsp;job, I think&nbsp;the change is designers has led to a bit of a change in style.&nbsp;That said, it&#39;s still a beautifully detailed set with excellent functionality. I would include a group shot of all three sets together, but my lack of technical skill prevents me from adding photos to reviews.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>This&nbsp;is a great set. There&#39;s no denying that. I&#39;m sure it will go down the same way as the Mixer and Ferris Wheel. But the odd choice of colours and slight&nbsp;overcompliaction of the model by adding an unnecessary theme make it not quite as perfect as it could be. Nonetheless, I strongly recommend it, especially if you don&#39;t have any other fairground sets and don&#39;t have to worry about them &quot;fitting&quot; together. Even if you do own the others, it&#39;s still a lovely addition to pad out your fair, and there&#39;s something very satisfying about watching a little Lego elephant endlessly bob up and down!</p>

"mablemyhre","2017-05-28T11:54:11.68Z","Another Great Carnival Ride","<p>Following the release of the Mixer and the Ferris Wheel, this is Lego&#39;s newest edition to the Carnival Rides. &nbsp;I cannot say enough about this set. It far surpasses the earlier version of the Grand Carousel. &nbsp;Once assembled it is much sturdier and can be moved with no risk of the base falling apart. &nbsp;This is a difficult build. There are a lot of repetitive&nbsp;building.&nbsp;It takes some time. &nbsp;But the final result is a working carousel with a tiger, a flamingo, a frog,&nbsp;and an elephant going up and down with a stationery swan. &nbsp;These animals are quit remarkable. &nbsp;It comes with a good selection of mini-figures. In all, this is a remarkable set that will display very nicely. I am awaiting a motor so I can motorize the set. &nbsp;Also, I have ordered a sound brick, that I&nbsp;will install.</p>

"lentil","2017-08-10T17:49:29.873Z","Whirling Golden Whimsy","<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>Very fun and interesting build that incorporates many imaginative ideas for functionality and beautiful design. The body of the carousel essentially consists of four main sections: 1) a sturdy base constructed of overlapping plates, 2) a two-layer raised platform which rests on top of the base like tiers of a wedding cake on a platter, 3) a central supportive column, and 4) a roof canopy. The platform (section 2) has a particularly interesting construction: each layer is composed of 12 wedge-shaped pieces that are laid on their sides and snapped together to form a circle, then affixed to the layer below. Lots of interesting SNOT and other techniques are used here to fit everything together. The central column is covered with eight decorative panels that snap on using angled hinges, creating an attractive tapered shape.</p>

<p>The build overall is complex but intuitive, and the instructions are generally very easy to follow. Bright contrasting colors are used for the hidden internal parts, which helps prevent mistakes. The one area that gave me a fair bit of difficulty was snapping the top cover onto the central column. The column is encircled with eight separate parts which are joined loosely on hinges, so the whole structure is a bit wobbly and delicate before the roof is affixed. Getting everything to line up properly was tricky, and as soon as part of the cover snapped on, bits would pop off the other side like popcorn, causing the entire internal column to collapse. The various pieces that need to line up are not visible while the cover is being placed, so this is a pretty tricky operation. I believe I managed it eventually (trying not to touch it again for fear of another implosion!), but definitely not something a child could do.</p>

<p>Motion of the carousel is created through a relatively simple gear mechanism that is housed in the base and powered by a hand crank. The lower platform has rubber tires mounted underneath which allow the entire structure to spin smoothly along a path of hidden tiles in the base. The roof canopy spins using a similar mechanism: rubber tires roll around a tiled track on top of the central column. The roof is not connected to the gear mechanism directly, but is connected to the lower platform with six long bars. When the lower platform spins, the roof is pulled along for the ride.</p>

<p>The up and down action of the animals is also cleverly done. This motion is created independently from the main gear mechanism. Each moving animal has a curved rotating bar attached to one of the tires in the roof canopy. The spinning of the tire moves the animal up and down. I absolutely love that this motion was included, as it adds a fun, realistic motion to the carousel animals. I have two minor quibbles here: one is that the tire setup is a bit finicky, as the slightest imbalance between the various sections of the carousel will lift one of the roof tires off its track for part of the circle, temporarily suspending that animal&rsquo;s movement (even while the roof itself is still spinning). Because of the tricky construction techniques used, it took a bit of experimental fiddling to get things aligned well enough for the tires to make contact with the track 100% of the time. I believe I managed it, but adjustments will probably be necessary as things naturally shift over time, and this could be difficult as the relevant core parts are buried under layers of bricks. The other minor quibble is that the pole the animals are attached to is not anchored at the bottom at all. The pole simply hangs from the roof, moving up and down through a large hole in the floor. Since the hole is much larger than the pole, the pole wiggles and wobbles like crazy all the time. It&rsquo;s an odd, trembly kind of motion which is somehow unsettling. Perhaps this was the only way to get it to work though, since the pole moves not only up and down, but side to side.</p>

<p>There is of course some repetition to a large build of this kind, but overall I did not find even the repetitious areas too tedious. Certainly much less so than #10247 Ferris Wheel, which was a near slog in places. The construction of the carousel is not entirely symmetrical, so mostly you&rsquo;re dealing with 4x of various parts, not 12x &ndash; really not so bad. There was some 12-24x level repetition with all the decorative bobbles at the end, but these are so small that they go pretty fast. Also, the building techniques used throughout are truly interesting, so it was pretty fun to see how everything connected up and worked together.</p>

<h3>The Finished Model</h3>

<p>The carousel looks incredibly beautiful when complete. I love the blue, gold, and white color scheme, and the whimsical fairy tale theme for the animals. The frog is my favorite, because I love how his legs move up and down, but all the brick-built animals are superbly done, and it&rsquo;s particularly nice that they created an assortment rather than 6 of the same thing. I really like the decision to have a fabric roof rather than a brick built one, which would have been heavy and awkward looking. The canvas-like fabric panels have just the right body and drape, but the white flexible bars that enclose them make the roof look perfectly LEGO-y.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m (naturally) not a fan of stickers, but here I do think they are warranted. The plethora of gold stickers adds a fantastic amount of bling to the final look which would not have been possible with printed pieces. The only stickers used are the gold metallic ones &ndash; everything else is printed. Especially lovely are the printed book tiles that decorate the roof.</p>

<p>As several others have commented, other than the swan there is no actual seating on the carousel! Minifigs must ride by holding on tight to the bar with one hand, which seems a bit precarious. With some animals, you could easily replace a smooth tile on their back with a studded one from your collection to provide some sort of foot/butt anchor, but with others it&rsquo;s not obvious how to modify them to create seating. The lack of secure seating really bothers my daughter, but for some reason not so much me &ndash; makes the carousel into a bit of a wild ride in fact! It also relieves the awkwardness of kid minifigs not being able to sit down anyway, due to their non-hingeable legs.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Seven are included: 3 children, a mom and dad, a grandma, and a ticket seller. The grandma is my favorite, with her sweet white chignon hairdo and blue cardigan sweater. The ticket seller is also a friendly looking, dapper elderly gentleman. The dad has an alternate sick face (perhaps funny, perhaps crude, depending on your taste), and the mom has an alternate sleeping face. (Not sure how/why she is going to be sleeping on the carousel&hellip; maybe she&rsquo;s riding the swan?) The grandma has an alternate face with subtly raised eyebrows, which for some reason looks hardly different from her regular face.</p>

<p>Accessories include two very nice printed ticket tiles, a popsicle, hot dog, ice cream cone, and camera. Overall an appropriate, fairly unsurprising, assortment of figs. I do feel that perhaps more could have been included for a set of this size, but Banana Suit Guy or the Roman Gladiator from your general collection can probably be recruited to hop on for a ride now and again&hellip;</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>LEGO has knocked another one out of the park with this one! I spent some time quibbling about minor things above, but overall this is yet another breathtaking set. We seem to be living in a golden age of LEGO&hellip; when will they stop so my wallet can have a rest? This model would fit nicely in any park scene, whether or not you have a fairground section in your display.</p>

<p>The finished model looks great next to #10247 Ferris Wheel, both in terms of style and scale. I do not have the older #10196 Grand Carousel, so can&rsquo;t legitimately compare them as builds. Judging just from pictures, this new carousel does seem to be a huge aesthetic improvement though!</p>

"DutchFlyer","2019-02-04T10:34:39.23Z","A true 16+ Merry Go Round","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The Carousel is the fourth&nbsp;in a series of 5 Creator Expert sets within the Fairground Theme, and the successor / re-imagination of <strong>set 10196 Grand Carousel</strong>. That 2009&nbsp;set has been a great hit, and is highly sought after by collectors, going for 1250 euros&nbsp;(brand new) and 770 euros&nbsp;(used) on BrickLink. The final result is one that should appeal to adults and children alike, but I do think the build is definitely one for adults. I like the building techniques used, the colour&nbsp;scheme and the rides. The swan is my personal favourite.&nbsp;</p>

<p>IMHO this is a good set, that offers good value for money, and room for some modification. It could also easily be included in a somewhat wider set-up (like a whole theme park). I like the fact that it can easily be motorized. I hope the upcoming Creator set is of similar quality, as I am well aware that this set is out of reach for many.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build of this carousel is listed as 16+ (as are all Creator Expert sets); where with many Expert sets I am somewhat skeptical of the recommended age, I think for this set it is warranted, or comes close to it. There are some tricky (and potentially frustrating) parts of the builds, and much of it is quite repetitive. Even my nephew (7 years old) when merely looking at the downloaded instructions mentioned how &#39;boring&#39; the build was, and it takes a lot for him to say something like that. The one element that would appeal to kids would be building the rides themselves.</p>

<p>There are a good number of stickers included, all of them with a reflective gold surface. I would guess that is because it is technically extremely difficult to do as a print.</p>

<p>Lego has done as good a job as possible with limiting the feeling of repetition during the build, for which they are to be commended.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>For me, the most enjoyable element of the build was seeing how the core was constructed and how the technical elements - that make the carousel work - are integrated and generally well hidden and covered up. There is also been an effective use of new pieces (like the 4-part toothed ring introduced with the Technic Bucket Wheel Excavator (set 42055) in 2016.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are 7&nbsp;minifigures in this set - which is the lowest of all 5 fairground sets released to date. There is one ticket vendor, there is one grandparent, one mom and dad, and three kids. The minfigures are good, but nothing special. I like the variety in faces and hair-pieces. They are perfectly comparable with the minifigures in the other fair ground sets. Personally I would have liked to have one or two more minifigures&nbsp;included.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Overall, this is a very smooth design, which seems to be the norm for the designer - Mike Psiaki - who for instance also designed the modular Downtown Diner (set 10260). The one negative of that is the there are relatively few if any studs available to attach minifigures on the floor of the carousel. One would have to modify the floor itself - which would require some pre-construction thinking beforehand, as it is a modification that is not easily done after the carousel has been completed.</p>

<p>Pay attention when putting together the final decorations, as the light blue &#39;elephant tusk&#39; pieces have a pin-hole on one side, and not on the other. One should be able to make sure that it is hidden from vision.&nbsp; &nbsp;Personally, I like the &#39;gold-plate&#39; mirror like stickers. Just take your time putting them on the bricks, because - again - them being crooked will be spotted.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best part of the carousel are the rides. They are fun little builds, with some nice techniques used to incorporate the poles that make them move up and down. My personal favourite is the swan. Even if you do not like the carousel, IMHO one should have a look at the construction manual and be inspired by the design of the animals.</p>

<p>Overall, I think the design is well done. I like the colour scheme. It is a bit of an old-style design, which might clash a bit&nbsp;with the more modern designs of the Fairground Mixer (set 10244), the Ferris Wheel (set 10247) and Roller Coaster (set 10261). It is packed with detail, and there is little that I would like to see changed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The turning wheel operating the carousel is housed in a fairly unobtrusive box, rather than the clumsy build seen in the Grand Carousel. I like the attachment mechanism, and I also feel that any builder should be able to come up with something to hide the motor effectively.</p>

<h2>Play vs display.</h2>

<p>As with many Creator Expert sets, this is IMHO primarily a display set. There is a play element - rotating the carousel and swapping out the minfigures&nbsp;- but that is about it. As a display set, it could be a nice conversation starter. It is well finished, and looks good from just about every angle. It could also easily be expanded in a somewhat bigger display. Mind you, it does take up some space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a display set, I would argue this on its own is the best set of all 5 of the Fairground sets.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, this is a very good set, worthy of inclusion in the Creator Expert line. Once finished, the occasional slogging through the build is definitely worth it. It could also work as a family building project. The price per part is good; so is the price looking at the final product. The one nit pick I have is that I would have liked to have one or two more minifigures in this set.</p>

<p>I honestly do hope that the Creator Carousel (set 31095) to be released in the summer will be just as good (comparatively), because I think anyone should be able to own a high quality carousel.</p>
