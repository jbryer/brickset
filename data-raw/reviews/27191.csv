<p>It is a quick build and does look the part once all together. While unique it&#39;s a bit ho-hum&nbsp;in that there is no real playability with it. It&#39;s designed to be a static figure. So, for my son, it is&nbsp;a boring Lego toy. After putting it together and leaving it out for a few days he disassembled it and is using it for spare/extra parts.&nbsp;I did not find any parts that were notable or unique.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I like the idea behind it and they did capture the look of Princess Leia in brick form. But it offers no play content. I&#39;d really say it&#39;s either for collectors of SW Lego universe or a diehard Princess Leia fan.</p>
