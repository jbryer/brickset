<p>It is pretty simple to build.&nbsp; It is mostly white bricks with splashes of color in the detachable boxes that look like bricks.&nbsp; A little care is needed to get the back pieces to line up.&nbsp; The boxes on the side connect with Technic pins.&nbsp; They used the grey&nbsp;pins so it is a bit easier to get them apart than it would have been with black pins.</p>

<h2>Using</h2>

<p>As a picture frame I think it works fine.&nbsp; I put a postcard in it and it looks great.&nbsp; It is not immediately obvious that it is made from LEGO&#39;s which I consider to be a bonus.&nbsp; I would prefer for the back to be filled in, but that would have made it more expensive and it totally works as it is.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t put anything in the boxes yet, but it should be useful for coins or paperclips.&nbsp; The lids come off ok although I had the plate stay stuck to the lid once.</p>

<h2>Modularity</h2>

<p>Aside from the normal LEGO level of customization they&#39;ve made it easy to do other things with your picture frame.&nbsp; Since the boxes are easily detached with 2 or 3 Technic pins you can attach other things to your picture frame.&nbsp; So far they&#39;ve released the&nbsp;40188 Pencil Pot which works with it.&nbsp; I think the Pencil Pot works better by itself, but I also made a business card holder that snaps onto either side.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>Lots of bricks and plates in only four colors.&nbsp; I&#39;m happy I made one, but it might be worth parting a few out.</p>
