THe stuntman is hard to transform. You have to take off the body and hat. Kinda hard. All in all i gave it a 10/10 because it is a studios set and they all deserve a 10.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-16T09:51:34Z","Great set","The idea of this set is great. one of the best sets of 2002. The figs with their shocked faces are a great idea. The werewolf man is very nice done. The Tree is nice with much brown pieces, It only could have more leaves. The oldtimer is nice.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The tree seems to be a little weird but the car is wicked cool. The other two minifigs will be scared when the werewolf comes out. This is very good for a Studios set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The couple in the old broom broom are really good,especially the girls torso which has a lot of adaptability. The car itself is really,really cool-its got a lot of character about it. Oh you get a spider as well!
The comic in the instructions makes me laugh everytime-and if you combine this with the Vampires Crypt it makes for a great theme.
I love it, it was cheap too!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Torax","2009-07-17T09:28:26.107Z","My review for set No. 1380-1","A really great set. The werewolf tranforms from a human into a werewolf, and you can change the face expressions of the two other minifigs. The tree attacks people passing by. I only wonder why the tree has rhino-like eyes.

Pros:
Cool car with good pieces
Awesome werewolf minifig
Cool tree, which, when a pin on the back is pulled, tilts over.

Cons:
The tree could use more green parts


That's all! Great set! Too bad it's not selling anymore.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2010-09-20T22:21:14.44Z","What's even scarier than a werewolf? This set's current price tag.","I, however, was lucky to purchase this at market price from a local KBToys. I'm glad I did. It was (and continues to be) one of my favorite Studios sets.<br><br><br>Building experience: Not much to expect, though the set does feature some lovely alternate builds. The car is a nice simple build and is reminiscent of 1930s cars. The tree does a good job of creating the classic ""B-horror movie"" feel to it. <br><br>Parts: Wow... so many good pieces in one $10 set! First off, we have the werewolf, whose headpiece only appears here and in The Shrieking Shack. The other two minifigures are also of a nice design. The gentleman and lady's heads are both dual-sided, showing looks of calmness and of panic. This makes the set definitely worth it. There's a nice mixture of brown, black, green, and the occasional blue that makes Werewolf Ambush a great set.<br><br>Playability: The only playable function(s) in this set are to turn the top of the tree from normal to ""creepy"" and to topple the tree over with the clever use of a technic pin.<br><br>Value for Money: $49 dollars for this set on bricklink? Nothing can justify that.<br><br><br><br>Final words: If you are lucky enough to come across this set at (or near) market price, pick it up. Moviegoers and trivia fanatics will get a scream out of this set.<br>",TRUE,3,4,3,2,3

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-15T13:13:42.457Z","LEGO Studios - Werewolf Ambush Review","I might be wrong but I think this is the first set which includes a werewolf minifig and the werewolf 'mask'. What I like about this set is that you get two torsos for the werewolf minifig. One torso has the markings of that creature with the destroyed shirt and the other one has the normal look. The face of that character is the same as in the LEGO Rock Raider minifig Sparks. The other minifigs we get are a gent and a lady. The gent comes with a tan suit and a red tie. He also has brown hair and a double-printed face. The face reminds me a little bit of James Bond. The lady comes with her dark red skirt and she has an orange hair piece. The face is double-printed as well.<br><br>The whole set is very easy to build and very sturdy. There're also no stickers included in this model. The car looks like a car which we've seen in the LEGO Adventurers theme a lot. But only because of the cockpit and the tyres. The windscreen does sviwel and the cockpit is big enough to put two minifigs into this vehicle. The tree looks very scary. The 'head' does sviwel full 360Â° and you can also tip the tree down if you pull the lever out which locks the tree. It's a fun little set to have.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"AETerry","2010-08-13T18:07:50.23Z","Werewolf Ambush Review","<div class=""description""><p>This is the one and only Studios set that I bought and mainly for the theme of a werewolf in it. The set was also fairly inexpensive to pick up at $10. <br></p><p>I was rather excited &amp; humored when I saw this set as I do love werewolves and this was pretty much the first set before any Harry Potter sets came out featuring one or the Collectible Minifigure werewolf.<br></p></div><p>
</p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are in booklet form with clear, easy to follow step-by-step illustrations. Also featured at the end of the instructions is a short little comic of the set just built.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's a total of 117 pieces in this set, most are for either the car or the tree build.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get three minifigures in this set. My favorite being the werewolf, then the female passenger of the car and her male friend driver. They're not too bad looking. The girl looks a lot like who they used for Maryjane in the Studio Spiderman set.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>The complete set is built largely in two parts. The first being for the car that two of the minifigures are riding in. It's fairly solid, taking after the newer car builds introduced with the Adventurers line.</p><p>The second build is for the Tree prop build. The top part of it is meant to swivel around, revealing scary looking monster eyes. Behind the tree is a special printed brick, showing that this is indeed meant to be a mechanical prop on a studio stage.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>It's not bad of a set. I never much cared for the tree build in this set. But I've liked the rest of it well enough, especially for the werewolf. It ends up being one of my favorite minifigures I have in my collection. And it was a good deal too at $10, making it easy to pick up. Though with the Monster Hunter theme coming now, it looks like there's a reprise and revisit to the famous Hollywood Monsters.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-22T12:19:09.49Z","AWOOOOOO! Beware the Full Moon","<p>Set #1380 Werewolf Ambush: LEGO Studios Monster Movies Sub-Theme is a must own group of sets from the LEGO Studios Theme. (I don't think it was actually called that, but since it represented Monster Movies I dubbed them Monster Movies Sub-Theme.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Werewolf Ambush set is the second cheapest set after the first (Curse of the Pharaoh.) and it is a great bargain for your dollar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The models of this set were an old style car and a set piece for a movie studio, the terrifying looking tree in the above picture that had a control panel piece and the ability to rotate the top so that it could look normal or frightening. These models are actually quite nice and could fit in to LEGO Town even without a Studios section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figures are great looking figures too. The woman uses the Mary-Jane Watson head and hairpiece from the Spider-Man studios set (so she has a double-sided head.) and the man is dressed in an outfit that looks like it could be from the 1940s. He also has a double-sided head, happy and scared.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 'Werewolf' included two torsos, an ordinary looking trucker's outfit and a furry version when he 'wolf's' out. The head piece mask is a great looking head piece too. A pity the Werewolf head piece was only ever included with this set. The regular Mini-Figure had the Stuntman's head on his body and wore a black cap.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set also included a black spider.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd say that you can't go wrong with any of these Studios sets. The Monster Mini-Figures are must haves and the models themselves give a suitably macabre looking feel to any LEGO Studio or Town/City display. The instructions for these sets were some of the first to include funny little comics in the back depicting an event featuring the set. (I especially like how the guy's girlfriend shows compassion for the werewolf after he bumped his head.) If you can find this set pick it up.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
