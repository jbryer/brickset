The models can easily be built. Children also like bricks with many different colours. There are enough windows with which you can create a room or at least half a room. It only has two walls, but you can add the other two walls quickly when you buy some more bricks. I really like the windmill. It looks good and its fun to play with it. The front part with the four blue plates really rotates. Very detailed for such a small building. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
