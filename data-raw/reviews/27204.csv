The Iconic Cave is the latter, most definitely, and was a promotional item last year in August. (Though I believe overstock left overs were given out close to the holidays.)</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Is it worth tracking down? That begs the question, and this Review will address it.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Packaging</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Placed in a cardboard cave shaped box with highly printed detailing the Iconic Cave is about 75% packaging. Packaging meant to evoke a certain familiar cartoon sitcom, The Flintstones. The printed imagery on the packaging is very LEGO based, with some LEGO items shown, such as a heart shaped item and a LEGO skeleton head on the front.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The back houses some pictures showing off other Minifigures not in this set and some bricks and studs, perhaps the beginnings of a new wing. There&rsquo;s a small window with a detailed interior of the house on one side and a laundry line with some hanging clothing on the other.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">All in all a very fun and clever packaging design. Open the little door in the front and you&rsquo;ll find that inside is a non-descript black tray with the Minifigures inserted inside.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Caveman: This, basically, is a re-release of the CMF Series 1 Caveman, however this version has a slightly altered print for his torso and legs as they changed the colour of what he was wearing.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">As I have never managed to get Series 1&rsquo;s Caveman at the moment, I cannot compare it accurately, however I will say this. It is a very impressive looking character, and the dark club accessory adds much to the look.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Cave Woman: Here now is one I did pick up when initially released, twice in fact, and I can safely say that her printing is definitely altered from what she looked like before. Her colouring is darker and more subdued, but the print is pretty much identical to the Series 5 Cave Woman, right down to the scuff mark on her cheek&hellip; in fact it&rsquo;s the exact same head, nothing was changed and it was probably re-used left over stock&hellip; or maybe it was put back into production, I&rsquo;m not 100% sure one way or the other honestly.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">She features the exact same accessory and hair piece as well. It&rsquo;s a bit of a shame that LEGO chose not to alter her look, it would have been nicer to see the dual-molded technique used for her legs, as now that, that has been introduced since the original release, having two-toned legs is much simpler and the printing doesn&rsquo;t look odd. LEGO probably didn&rsquo;t want to upset how the original was made though, as re-printing the print on a different set of legs may not have been cost effective.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Not a terrible little promotional set, the real fun is when you have the pair of them with the box. It&rsquo;s also a great way to get these two characters with altered colour prints if you missed Series 1 and 5 respectively. That being said, it&rsquo;s going to be difficult to find in the secondary market&hellip; or&hellip; well I haven&rsquo;t looked it up, but I&rsquo;d presume that it would at least be a costly item compared to getting it for free direct from LEGO when it was being offered.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Overall I&rsquo;d recommend picking this up for people who really, really want it. But if you can&rsquo;t justify the asking price from secondary sellers, don&rsquo;t feel bad if you can&rsquo;t get it. It&rsquo;s a nice promo item, don&rsquo;t get me wrong, just not 30$ nice&hellip; or whatever it might be as of the date of this write-up.</span></span></span></span></p>
