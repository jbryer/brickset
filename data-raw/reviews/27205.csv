&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build/Minifigure: Well all there is the figure, head torso and legs. The legs aren&#39;t event printed. Plain blue. Bleh. The head and torso are unique, but Hank Pym&#39;s Giant Man? Who asked for this? The comics version of Hank Pym has never been popular, likeable, or memorable for good things. Aside from striking his wife, The Wasp, Janet van Dyne in this version of his size-changing alter-ego, I can&#39;t think of anything this persona did. And just like its source material, this minifigure has nothing to offer that&#39;s memorable. Aside from scratching a completionist itch, there&#39;s not much here.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value: This was a GWP, so it&#39;s tough to come by at a decent price. Unles you find it cheap, easy skip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking at the minifig now it is the usual high quality we expect from Lego.&nbsp; What I especially like about the minifig are the bright colors and how true they are to the comic version of Giant Man.&nbsp; The blue and yellow outfit go together especially well with the bright gold visor he wears.&nbsp; Details are even seen across the waist that we see in the comic version.&nbsp; However a bit of a let down is that there is no printing on the legs.&nbsp; Being a polybag limited release figure you would hope for more, like maybe some yellow added boots, or the groin part of the legs being yellow vs blue.&nbsp; This would have made the figure much more true to the comics version.</p>

<p>To end with, even though Giant Man isn&#39;t well known in todays Marvel universe, Hank Pym was a founder of the original Avengers, so in my mind any minifig of him is a welcome addition.</p>
