First opening with an overview of the LEGO train lines and models through the years, then presenting&nbsp;MOCs&nbsp;and explaining variations among scales, and finally providing instructions for the presented material, Matthes&nbsp;has managed to produce a book that not only introduces the world of LEGO Trains but sends the reader into their own projects with a sense&nbsp;of full support from the LEGO Train community.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>There are of course no actual LEGO pieces included and &quot;playability&quot; doesn&#39;t exactly apply, but the book stands on its own as a special addition to any LEGO Train collection, no bricks required.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
