"I_am_Groot","2018-06-04T20:56:14.89Z","Mehhh","<p>This is a review of the LEGO Star Wars Rogue One Scarif Stormtrooper. It has 25 pieces and was a freebie from LEGO.com. It was the 2nd polybag to&nbsp;include both a figure and a display stand. First of all, I love the idea of it including a display stand that can connect to ones included in&nbsp;future figures. I like the exclusive printed backdrop, but unlike the newer ones, it has a long line of copyright info on it. Thankfully most of it is covered up by the figure. It also has a stickered 1 x 4 tile and as stated earlier, it can connect with the other polybag. LEGO has already made two different Scarif Stormtrooper minifigs, one a normal, and one a&nbsp;captain. This one is intended to be a squad leader. It is always nice to get different ranks of troopers, especially for MOC makers. The helmet is reused, the torso and leg prints are new though. I always complain about figures not getting dual molding, but it doesn&#39;t make as much of a difference on this figure as the sides and back of the legs are covered by a black cloth piece. The arms are done in all sand blue.&nbsp;The sand blue are&nbsp;SUPPOSED to be&nbsp;ONLY on the shoulders. This should have been done with dual molding. There should also be some white printing on that and some red on his right arm. This is very disappointing. At the very&nbsp;least he&nbsp;does match the quality of the other two&nbsp;Shoretroopers.&nbsp;And guess which face he uses? Angry Clone. He also includes a&nbsp;nice gun.</p>

<p>Overall, not great. The quality of Star Wars polybags has dropped ever since the First Order Officer one came out. The fact that this only consists of new legs and torso prints is disappointing. Dual Molding or at least printing would have been EXTREMELY nice. Nothing is too unique about this figure either. There are plenty of other figures LEGO could have made, such as Saw Gerrera and Galen Erso (figures we have still not gotten to this day). Thankfully it looks like the quality of these figures MAY be improving. Although DJ was a disaster, the Han Solo Mudtrooper and Kessel Mine worker polybags coming out soon look... not that great, but better. I am happy to add this to my Rogue One collection, but it just feels to me like a wasted slot for a polybag. Despite this, I would recommend this if you can find it for under 10 bucks and collect the other polybags of this type.</p>

"Slobrojoe","2020-01-17T20:01:04.8Z","Battle on the beaches...reignited!","<p>Rogue One, a Star Wars story, has brought fans an additional 12 sets to add to their collection. 3 of them are poly bags and 2 are battle packs. This is the Scarif Stormtrooper.</p>

<p>The set is packed as a poly bag with a step by step fold-out instructions leaflet.</p>

<p>His helmet is beige with some black outlines. It also has a sandy&nbsp;orange moon insignia on the top corner. The head is a standard clone trooper face. The torso is printed with a small belt and chest plate armour. The top of the torso and arms are a metallic blue, showing the rank of squad leader. The torso is printed on both sides. The legs are brown and beige, with a material leg guard behind him. There are 3 sets that have Scarif Stormtroopers in and each one brings a new design.</p>

<p>The stand itself is mainly composed of the minifigure&nbsp;baseplate that we all know and love from the collectible series. A sticker tells us who he is and a backdrop shows the planet of Scarif. It has the logos of Lego and Star Wars printed on it and is held in place by 2 light grey bushes. It also has a connector pin to connect it to others in the series like R3-M2.</p>

<p>Overall, I would&#39;ve liked to have seen a new facial expression for the sand trooper but it does impress with the ability to blend in with any Rogue One scene.</p>
