Based on the Reboot of the popular action cartoon show from Craig McKraken doesn&rsquo;t have the exact same charm in certain respects, but at least the reboot gave us a pair of LEGO sets and this digital world to explore in LEGO Dimensions.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Flying over the City of Townsville is Buttercup, the scrappy Powerpuff who enjoys engaging in battles and proving her strength. She has a confident smirk on her face and looks great. This is a fun Package and definitely works well for what it is doing.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">A limited number of parts are included in this set, so really there isn&rsquo;t a lot to discuss here. I must admit though, while the elements of this set aren&rsquo;t very rare, they are a mixture of nice green colours which is a treat to see here as it matches with the Minifigure colour scheme quite well.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minifigures</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Buttercup: The Powerpuff Girls don&rsquo;t need accessories, and the prints on each of them are identical, so the only differences between Buttercup and her Sisters are the unique head molding and the colour of her torso. (Green.) So, ultimately, there is little to discuss here, but she&rsquo;s definitely a Powerpuff through and through and makes a great display piece. Her Toy Tag is printed with the word Bam on it in classic Adam West Batman style font, because the cartoon always used such things during battles, so it&rsquo;s a nice inclusion here.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Mega Blast Bot: I&rsquo;m not entirely sure if this is based on something from the new show, it probably is, but it&rsquo;s a rather lackluster build for a first outing. This is yet another robot model and the build is relatively bland in the use of parts. There are no joints, instead it&rsquo;s a solid squat machine that seems to be more of a paperweight.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Slammin&rsquo; Guitar: This build is highly more imaginative and definitely a much better use of the parts. I really found that this is a much more solid build and make a fairly decent final model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Ka-Pow Cannon: This is much more in keeping with Buttercup&rsquo;s personality from what I expect. This model while being a tad limited due to the nature of the parts used, is still a pretty solid looking build and pretty clever too. It isn&rsquo;t often you get to brick build a large fist after all.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The completed model</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Mega Blast Bot: I believe I expressed my disappointment with this model in the build section, but it stands to reason that more could be said. The details are fairly limited once built and the head design just feels boring. It also has no moveable parts so it&rsquo;s stuck in a static pose with the Technic axle piece in one hand to represent a weapon.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Slammin&rsquo; Guitar: I really like this model. It&rsquo;s a giant guitar, which just looks so much more interesting than the robot. I mean it&rsquo;s something unique and different, we see plenty of robots in this game, but not a lot of other clever models used for the toy tag items.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Ka-Pow Cannon: This third and final build looks like a giant green fist on some kind of tracked vehicle. It&rsquo;s rather inventive and fun and is leaps above the original build. Again I am not certain if these models exist in the reboot television show, but they really stand out to me as very creative and a lot better designed than the initial model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Adventure World: While the characters can be said to come from anywhere, this is definitely more inspired by the Reboot rather than the Original. A lot of the locations and events in this Adventure World are drawn directly from the episodes of the Reboot. As such you will find a lot of things that appeal more to the younger fans as opposed to us original viewers of The Powerpuff Girls. The characters themselves even have dialogue with the Teen Titans which reference their crossover episode. But you still get to explore all of Townsville and solve puzzles for its citizens.</span></span></span></span></p>

Buttercup can activate Gyrosphere Switches by creating a ball of energy around her, can perform Spinjitzu, pull Super Strength Handes, Dive, Regenerate Hearts, destroy Cracked LEGO Objects, Fly and create Lantern Constructs.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Slammin&rsquo; Guitar gains a Special Attack, acts as a Special Weapon and can Sonar Smash. The Ka-Pow Cannon acts as a Special Weapon, can access Accelerator Switches and Tow-Bars and destroy Cracked LEGO Objects. All-in-all, a limited, but interesting combination of abilities to access.</span></span></span></span></p>

The only difference is the Battle Arena, and unless you really enjoy Multiplayer and want to unlock every different Battle Arena then you really don&rsquo;t need to purchase everything from Series 2.</span></span></span></span></p>
