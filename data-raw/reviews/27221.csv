In Block Form.","<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Set #71346 The Powerpuff Girls Team Pack:</span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;""> We have arrived to the final Team Peak of LEGO Dimensions. This was the last release for anything LEGO Dimensions in the last wave and it was also the last item I picked up for my collection. (As of the date of writing this review, still optimistic for snagging Supergirl at least.) And it was well worth it.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Packaging</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Blossom and Bubbles are on the front and sides of this package racing off to save Townsville. The set is shown on the front and we see all of the various models of the builds in the set. It&rsquo;s the last of the Team Pack packages to discuss as well, which makes me feel a tad melancholy. It&rsquo;s sad to see LEGO Dimensions gone and I wouldn&rsquo;t object to a revival of the Theme as buildable sets if it meant getting more of these awesome packages.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This set features mostly purple and red elements with some white and black tossed in for good measure. Some printed elements exist, the face for the smartphone and the eyes for octi are printed elements, which may interest some folks. I should try more often to list every part in the set by name, but honestly a sloped brick and a cheese slope are really the same thing from set to set. If you think I should modify how I discuss the parts in the sets just let me know.</span></span></span></span></p>

She&rsquo;s smart, powerful and always dresses in pink. She also has ice breath, which we&rsquo;ll get into later as part of her abilities. No accessories for the pair unfortunately.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bubbles: Dressed in her traditional blue outfit. Bubbles has a very impressive head sculpt, as with her sisters, the trio represent the Powerpuff Girls very well. I adore the way they&rsquo;ve captured the unique animation in plastic form with LEGO.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Octi: This build is really quite impressive for what it is. Looks just like the cartoon, and uses a load of parts. This is a really fun build to construct and I think it stands out as one of the best from LEGO Dimensions as a whole.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Sonic Squid: This secondary build takes the large octopus stuffed animal and turns it into a thin squid, this build isn&rsquo;t too different from Octi, but just different enough to make the model look different and equally impressive. Not as creative, it isn&rsquo;t hard to turn an octopus into a squid, but it was still a fun build.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Super Skunk: This is extremely creative, the Super Skunk build is just all around fun, and it&rsquo;s great to see a mostly purple skunk running around with the Powerpuff Girls. The physical model is really great as a build too, all three models are quite impressive and for the last Team Pack ever made I&rsquo;m pleased to see that all six models are very impressive in design and functionality.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">PPG Smartphone: Based on the new cartoon reboot, this phone isn&rsquo;t the same as the original, but it&rsquo;s a solid build. And a solid model, it&rsquo;s also different from E.T&rsquo;s Phone Home.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">PPG Hotline: The iconic original build here just works as the best model for Blossom in my opinion. The build is great fun and uses the parts effectively.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Powerpuff Mag-Net: This is a really clever little model too, as I noted above all six models in this set are strong builds. Strong toys and look great.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Octi &amp; Alternate Builds: As I discussed in the build section I find all three of these builds to be truly impressive and worthy of being built, some Dimensions models are just there to fill a role, can be easily ignored and never built out of your existing parts. The trio offered with Bubbles are all three highly impressive, imaginatively fun, and work great on and off the Toy Tag.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">PPG Smartphone &amp; Alternate Builds: The same can be said here, while I am not a huge fan of the reboot or its design, I do dig the idea of a Smartphone replacing the old Adam West era Batman throwback the original cartoon used. And you can have both versions with spare parts from your collection to display and play with. The Mag-Net is just a fun, quirky additional thing thrown into the mix, but it works as a solid model. Especially with the goofy smile print on the side.</span></span></span></span></p>

I think I covered most of what can be done here with Buttercup, and as I noted there if you&rsquo;re only getting one Powerpuff set I think this is the better offering, the models are far better and the characters are personal favorites of mine.</span></span></span></span></p>

Mostly because of my solo play style.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Character &amp; Vehicle Abilities: With two characters and two toys you get a load of abilities here.</span></span></span></span></p>

She has the Freezing Breath, Lantern Constructs, Dive, X-Ray Vision, Regenerate Hearts and Intelligence Puzzle solving abilities. She can also Fly and destroy Cracked LEGO Objects.</span></span></span></span></p>

It can also destroy Gold LEGO objects. The PPG Hotline can destroy Rainbow LEGO Objects and acts as a Special Weapon. The PPG Mag-Net acts as a Special Weapon, has Enhanced Stud Attraction and can destroy Silver LEGO Objects.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Bubbles as a character also has Laser, Flying, Dive, Regenerate Hearts and Lantern Constructs. She can destroy Cracked LEGO Objects, Rainbow LEGO Objects, activate Parseltongue Doors, use Sonar Smash and interact with Atlantis puzzles.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Octi can Destroy Gold LEGO Objects. The Sonic Squid can use Water Spray while the Super Skunk can Dig, Super Jump and Vine Cut. A fairly limited range of abilities.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I&rsquo;d strongly recommend this set. The digital content is impressive, with both characters having a load of power. The physical toys are all fairly strong as well, and I believe is a much better creative approach to PPG compared to the builds in Buttercup&rsquo;s Fun Pack. And with the Powerpuff Girls sets being made available you can get Buttercup as a Minifigure that way if you still want her without needing to get the Dimensions set for her. Strongly Recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
