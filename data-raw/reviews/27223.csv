The sand worm is defiantly one of the best of the &nbsp;dimensions builds. The minfigure of Beetlejuice&nbsp;is exclusive&nbsp;to this set and he has some amazing printing on the torso and legs and also has a duel sided face print with an angry and happy face. His hair piece is a recolor of the Doc Brown hair piece in green and it is a very accurate fit for the minifig.</p>

<p>Overall this set is very cool because the Beetlejuice&nbsp;minifigue&nbsp;is very accurate and &nbsp;awesome to get, also the build for the sandworm&nbsp;is a great build that looks awesome. I would recommend this set if you are fan of the film and want the character and I&nbsp;&nbsp;also recommend&nbsp;it for people who&nbsp;wan to play it in the game and is definatley&nbsp;&nbsp;worth the money.</p>

Not sure why they didn&rsquo;t print his feet too, it looks a little odd seeing it that way. Still, it could be worse I suppose. No accessories unfortunately, it might have been nice to get our first LEGO beetle, oh well, perhaps another time.</span></span></span></span></p>

The Sandworm looks great, the detail is perfect and the double mouth gimmick of the stop-motion creature is accurately depicted. The Spooky Spider is a bit questionable, but it&rsquo;s very impressive. It is a bit on the weaker side compared to the other two models, but that is nothing to be concerned with, because it is still a solid little model.</span></span></span></span></p>

There was no glitching in this world from what I can recall. You explore the outside of the Deetz home somewhere in the wastes of Saturn. Once inside you get to visit some of the rooms and solve puzzles as with most of the places in LEGO Dimensions. Journey to the attic and you can visit the third and final big area of the world and movie. The massive model of the town. All of this area is just loads of fun and it was a thrill to explore it all fully.</span></span></span></span></p>

A single ability which is extremely useful. To Spooky Spider can destroy Gold and Silver LEGO Objects has the Tow-Bar ability of all things and a Super Jump. Pretty crazy abilities right, but wait, access the Haunted Vacuum and you&rsquo;ll get the power to destroy Red Demon Objects, add the Special Weapon ability, keep Super Jump and then have the Enhanced Stud Attraction. A pity you probably won&rsquo;t need tons of studs at this point to access anything. Overall a solid selection of abilities.</span></span></span></span></p>

The discussion of the last LEGO Dimensions set. Although I do have plans to review the digital content of the two Polybags, which I have yet to own. (Yet still hope to someday.) I dig this set, the digital content is awesome and the physical content is just a great level of fun. I&rsquo;d recommend it strongly to add to your LEGO Dimensions collection. It&rsquo;s also great to see a Tim Burton property in LEGO video game form. Here&rsquo;s hoping that someday we may see a LEGO Disney inspired game with Nightmare Before Christmas and other movies added for a LEGO Dimensions type collision of worlds. Perhaps inspired by Kingdom Hearts. Strongly Recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2020-08-16T15:20:09.887Z","The only completely overpriced theme ","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>The beetlejuice film is one I very much enjoy and that is why I go this set but looking back I now realise how overpriced this theme was as a whole .</p>

<p>The Minifigures-</p>

<p>The figure has a very nice recolour of doc Brown&#39;s hair piece and has a double sided face with a happy face and an annoyed expression , his torso is also great and the arms have a great print and finally the legs are very good as well . The stand is the regular dimensions stand and has a very cool beetlejuice print on it .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build depicts the Saturn sand worm fairly well and has a very nice arching technique and a has with sharp teeth and a head with yellow eyes&nbsp; also I like the detail of the fact it all tests on a 2&times;3 light tan plate above the dimensions stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this a good set but &pound;15 uk is a terrible price but I do wish I got other packs like the goonies ( my favourite film) , both back to the future ones , the gremlins one an the ET one . Keeping in mind I never played the game as gaming is not an interest of mine but maybe this is worth it for the game but for me it&#39;s mainly the figure and build .&nbsp;</p>
