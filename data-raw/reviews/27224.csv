<p>I was so excited to get this as soon as it became available in NZ. Crickey!... when I opened the box I was floored.</p>

<p>The instructions and sticker sheet weren&#39;t protected and I scored me a munted&nbsp;instruction book and a warped baseplate. I don&#39;t know why Lego did not protect the set&#39;s instructions and sticker sheet as has been practiced over the last few years but I wrote to them letting them know that this level of quality is disgraceful for the price we pay. NZ$300.</p>

<p>Fortunately I had a spare tan baseplate&nbsp;to start- and the original baseplate&nbsp;should staighten out in the end, but it&#39;s just not the same...</p>

<p>For 35 years of using Lego, I&#39;ve had my fair share of munted instruction books, beaten up sticker sheets and have a beautiful library of torn up and scribbled on instructions and catalogues, but for a premium model fresh out of the box in 2017, it was certainly a let down to see this beautiful model is being allowed to go to market in this state.</p>

"Matt_Z_","2017-09-16T05:10:09.23Z","A Shining Example of what a Lego Set Can Be","<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a preface, this review is being written on the heels of a rather historic Summer 2017 for The Lego Group and its&nbsp;fans. The release of massive sets including Destiny&#39;s Bounty, Ninjago City, and of course, the new UCS Millennium Falcon have exploded on the scene, giving consumers a shocking array of purchasing options in a short period of time. Lost slightly amid the shuffle is the new 21310 Old Fishing Store, the largest Lego Ideas set (by piece count) released to date.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>That being said, how does this set stack up against its competitors who seem to be grabbing all the headlines? Well, in this reviewers opinion, 21310 Old Fishing Store emanates originality to stand out amongst its peers- reminding us that creativity, ingenuity, originality, and play are still the key ingredients at the heart of what makes a Lego set truly great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Building Experience</p>

<p>Like many modulars before it, this building experience employs exceptional techniques that pay a religious attention to detail from the ground up, from bags 1 to 7. As an Adult Fan of Lego, I found the building experience to be enthralling from step 1 through step 313. The build is methodical, and ever changing. While you will be snapping on tiles to headlights bricks on the exterior throughout the course of the build, it somehow never felt repetitive. This is due to the variety in the process- instructions are such that you go from focusing on the exterior, to the interior, and back, and so on and so forth. Sticker application is confined to one small sheet and allowed for relatively seamless application on often flat surfaces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Accessories&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are times when a set can rely on accessories too much to artificially inflate piece count. This is not the case in this set. &nbsp;I&#39;m not going to list every accessory here as they are well documented under the Parts section on this sets homepage. However, even though I knew that the set appeared to contain a plethora of accessories, I wasn&#39;t prepared for the absolute bonanza that awaited me. It&#39;s truly incredible with respect to&nbsp;the volume and type of marine based parts you receive with this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Interior</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The interior of the old fishing shop is appropriately cramped with these parts, as well as gorgeous printed pieces including sticky notes, calculator, money, hook boxes, cash register, signs, and more. It was such an engaging experience to place and mount everything in the interior of the store, and having the back of the main building swing open to reveal the interior is a perfect way to capitalize on playability. Truly wonderful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Exterior</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The roof, stairwell, deck, and sides of the building really make the build shine. Never before have I been asked to snap 1x2 flat tiles (sand green, no less!) on to headlight bricks AT AN ANGLE. While this may seem par for the course for advanced builders, it is so refreshing to see these sort of fan-pioneered techniques finally (FINALLY) make their way to an official Lego retail set. Even though I don&#39;t know the designer and have nothing to do with the design of this set, I somehow felt a sense of pride to see the techniques like this in a lego set for the first time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can go on about the bonus rooms and contents of accessories, the design of the wooden planked roof, the included animals, the wall technique, and more, but I really don&#39;t want to spoil the ENTIRE build for interested parties. It&#39;s one of&nbsp;those builds you have to experience yourself and you will quickly realize the rewarding nature of this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Cons</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, to remain somewhat objective, I will add a couple small cons. For such a marine based set, I would have wanted the &quot;ship in a bottle&quot; accessory from POTC series to be included, and its exclusion here was a bit of a quirky oversight in my opinion. Furthermore, a 1x1 flat tile compass (from either POTC or the new hiker cmf) would have been nice. Finally, the back of the building behind the tower is rather barren. Here, a small dory or boat being dry-docked may have added to playability and rounded off the backside of the model. Finally, while the detail of the roof itself is amazing I wasn&#39;t thrilled with the &quot;lie&quot; of it on top of the store.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The design, build, interior and exterior detailing, MOC-like techniques, accessories, color scheme, and playability ultimately culminate in a set that combines the best of what Lego can achieve. It harkens back to a time where originality and creativity fostered amazing building and play experiences now manifesting themselves through talented builders across the world. Whether one buys this as a display piece or a playable piece, you will not be disappointed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Old Fishing Store proves that rehashed licensed sets are not the only way to capture the best of what lego has to offer, showing once again that originality and imagination are truly the keys to the best that a Lego experience can be.&nbsp;</p>

"rab1234","2018-07-06T19:16:37.59Z","A Decent Display Piece, but Don't Touch!","<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>I wanted to enjoy this build as I did the modular line, but it felt like it was missing something.&nbsp; Too many small plates on the side, repetition, lack of mini-builds, and smaller than expected finale.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>A lot of parts and in good colors.&nbsp; Plenty of interesting extras to fill out the shop as well.&nbsp; This set offers an excellent price per piece.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>I was hoping this would offer better playability as I like to let my kids play with the modulars (as long as they&#39;re not being overly destructive).&nbsp; This set feels pretty flimsy when put together and the cramped interior does not lend itself to play from little or big kids.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>Middle of the road for value.&nbsp; There are a lot of good pieces included and the finished structure looks good, but I didn&#39;t enjoy the build and you can&#39;t do much other than display it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Overall</strong></h2>

<p>I really wanted to like this one as much as the modulars, but it just doesn&#39;t feel like a sturdy lego set.&nbsp; It still very much feels like a well done MOC.&nbsp; Aesthetically, it&#39;s very attractive, but I can&#39;t recommend this one based on the price, unexciting build, and lack of playability unless you&#39;re just looking for a display piece.&nbsp;</p>

"Brick_Cuppy","2017-12-27T18:55:36.577Z","ol' captain Anton's wonderful fishing store","<p>I think the Old Fishing store wasn&#39;t quite recieved with enough attention when it was announced, nor when it was released. It was overshadowed by the likes of the new Millenium Falcon, NINJAGO City, and it&#39;s big brother the Saturn V rocket. Nevertheless, the Old Fishing Store rivals the modular building&#39;s in detail, and I am excited to open the box and get building!</p>

<h2><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></h2>

<p>The humungous box is stunning, featuring worn, sand green boards running around the whole box. The IDEAS logo is there, too. The single instruction booklet (although I think it&#39;s to big to be called a booklet...) has 278 pages, 263 of which are actual building steps, while the remaining 15 are for the parts inventory, adverts, and interviews with the lego and fan designers, as is usual with IDEAS sets.</p>

<h2><strong>Minifigures:</strong></h2>

<p>The 4 minifigs that come with the old fishing store aren&#39;t anything to special, but they&#39;re nice all the same.</p>

<p><strong><em>the captain:</em></strong> Whom I assume is Anton, is wearing a lovely new knitted jersey. His headgear has only appeared once before in a <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71001-10/Sea-Captain"">collectable minifigure</a>, and his face features a grey beard. I think Anton is my favourite. He has attitude.</p>

<p><strong><em>the fisherman:</em></strong> Is one of two minifigs in this set to have duel-molded legs, in this case black and olive green to represent boots and overalls, which continue onto his torso. He is wearing a dark grey toque, and has dark tan sideburns on his smiling face. overall, a nice fig.</p>

<p><strong><em>the fisherwoman: </em></strong>Is the second minifigure to have duel-molded legs, this time in black and sand blue. The torso features a white T-shirt underneath a tan vest covered in fishing gear. The head is rather plain, with a common smiling face and dark brown pony tail. Again, a nice fig, but nothing to special.</p>

<p><strong><em>the young boy: </em></strong>Is definitely my least favourite. All of his parts are common, grey pants, green shirt underneath a blue jacket, freckled, smily face. Quite boring, to be honest. But he adds play value, I suppose.</p>

<h2><strong>Parts:</strong></h2>

<p>I will be talking about the parts at some length in this review, but if you want an even more in-depth look at the amazing parts this set has to offer, I will refer you to New Elementary&#39;s excellent <a href=""http://www.newelementary.com/2017/08/review-lego-ideas-21310-old-fishing-store.html"">review</a>. Obviously, there is a lot of sand green elements, indeed there have been many new sand green elements this <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/colour-Sand-Green/category-System/year-2017"">year</a>. Actually, although there are 230 sand green elements, there are only four different types:</p>

<ul>
	<li>107 of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4616578/flat-tile-1x2"">sand green 1x2 tile</a>: these aren&#39;t very rare, but the fishing store has nearly 4 times more than the next largest quantity!</li>
	<li>83 of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6192923/flat-tile-1x4"">sand green 1x4 tile</a>: only appearing in 2 sets, we get another tile, this time longer. We now have to different sand green tiles</li>
	<li>35 of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6202626/flat-tile-1x3"">sand green 1x3 tile</a>: exclusive to this set, we have yet again another tile, an uneven-lengthed one to fill your odd-numbered needs. After you buy the fishing store, you probably won&#39;t need any more sand green tiles.</li>
	<li>5 of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6184432/plate-1x2-w-1-knob"">sand green 1x2 jumper plate</a>: only five of the incredibly useful jumper plate in this beautiful color, but still more than any other set. I hope we will soon see a 1x1 tile in sand green.</li>
</ul>

<p>So that concludes the sand green elements, but there are still many other rare (under 10 sets), re-colored, and interesting pieces to be found</p>

<p>There are several pieces that are no longer rare, but I still get excited when I see them because they are so useful;</p>

</ul>

<p>There are also several largest quantities of a certain element in this set, such as:</p>

</ul>

<p>Of course, I must mention all the rare/new elements besides those I have already mentioned:</p>

<ul>
	<li>20 of olive green <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6058242/brick-1x1"">1x1 brick</a></li>

	<li>2 of dark tan <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6132768/plate-1x3"">1x3 plate</a></li>
	<li>20 of dark tan <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6146462/plate-1x4-w-2-knobs"">1x4 plate w/ 2 studs</a></li>
	<li>1 of pearl gold <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6146054/tap-%C3%B84-9-6-4"">1x1 1/2 &quot;tap&quot; element</a></li>

</ul>

<p>And finally, we have the printed elements. I prefer stickers to printing, since you can decide if you want the sticker or not, and you can put them on a different piece if you wish. But the prints in this set are really great, and they make the model look better:</p>

</ul>

<p>After all of that, I still haven&#39;t covered all the amazing parts in the old fishing store! I recommend you take a look through the inventory.</p>

<h2><strong>Build</strong></h2>

<p>Opening the box reveals 16 bags numbered 1 - 7, filled to the brim with pieces. I had no trouble following the 313 building steps, but they were complicated enough to make you look closely, particularily since the colors are all very similar in tone. There aren&#39;t very many interesting techniques; the only one I can see is the placement of &quot;wood&quot; tiles by only one stud and manually positioned. I am surprised that this passed TLG&#39;s rigorous examinations. Not that I&#39;m complaining.</p>

<p>Building the Old Fishing Store was an absolute joy. It wasn&#39;t as complicated as many other sets are, Just stacking bricks and plates, with a bit of SNOT mixed in. I wish more sets were like this one. Complex, intricate sets are nice, but the simple sets have a certain charm to them that I love.</p>

<h2><strong>Completed Model:</strong></h2>

<p>The finished set is extremely detailed, both on the outside and inside. The sand green boards contrast nicely with the irregular brown wooden floors and roof. The inside is just as detailed as outside, with tiled floors, desks, and decorated concrete walls. Fishing-related items are randomly scattered across the entire set, bringing life and realism to the building. My particular favourites are the lovely office, the printed fishing bait tiles, and the brick-built red bouy, hanging from the wall.</p>

<h2><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></h2>

<p>The Old Fishing Store is a remarkable set, and I am extremely pleased with it. Still, it is not without flaws; the roof onn the tower is a different color than the roof above the main building, creating a contrast that I don&#39;t think matches. Also, the size was smaller than I was expecting, especially considering the amount of pieces it has. It is slightly smaller than a modular building in terms of interior area, though it has about the same amount of pieces. But the positives far outweigh the negatives, and I would rate the Fishing Store second only to the incredible Saturn V as best IDEAS set released yet.</p>

<p>In conclusion, the old Fishing Store is fabulous, absolutely as good, possibly even better than, a modular building. The parts are amazing, the build was lovely, the price is good, and the completed model is extremely detailed. I would highly recommend 21310 Old Fishing Store!</p>

I loved the entirety of build and the finished product is something I will be happy to display for years to come. This IDEAS set is amazing and after completing the build I completely understand how it got up to 10,000 votes in six weeks. Kudos to the Designer and the LEGO team that helped put out an amazing final product. </span></span></p>

<p><b><u>Box/Packaging/Instructions</u></b></p>

<p>-The box is actually really neat for this set. The set is displayed superimposed over a beach scene and there is fishing store imagery like nets and buoys. The greenish blue color scheme sticks out in comparison to the standard LEGO box colors you tend to see. I&rsquo;m not generally into the box for anything other than value, but when I received this in the mail my first thought was how well done the design for this box was.</p>

<p>-The instruction booklet is a sturdy glue-bound booklet roughly the size of a notebook. It contains an intro by the IDEAS designer and the LEGO designer about the initial designs for the set, adjustments, and cool tidbits of information like how the store got the name &ldquo;Anton&rsquo;s Bait Shop.&rdquo; The Booklet is 278 pages and contains 313 building steps.</p>

<p>- The set is broken up into 7 sections with each section containing 2-3 numbered bags. Have your sorting bowls ready!</p>

<p><b><u>Minifigs</u></b></p>

<p>-The set comes with 4 minfigs; Captain, Fisherman, fisherwoman, and young boy. The set also includes multiple animals like seagulls, lobster, fish, and a cat.</p>

<p>-I thought the Captain, fisherman, and fisherwoman had great details and the face for the captain is particularly awesome. The torso and leg prints are great designs and really go with the theme of the set.</p>

<p>-The young boy was a bit plain and in a greater sense almost seems a bit out of place in this set. I think 4 minifigs was a good choice for this this set based on the size, but I think they could have maybe gone a different direction with this minifig choice.</p>

<p><b><u>Set-Build</u></b></p>

<p>-Overall I really enjoyed this set build. It took me about 6 hours to complete with a few breaks here and there.</p>

<p>-The instructions are very straightforward and the pieces are separated into groups in a way that makes it fairly easy to know where you need to go for the piece. You definitely have to pay attention to the orientation in the instructions, but once you get the first layer built it becomes much easier to identify which way to orient the base plate.</p>

<p>-There are certainly a lot of pieces in this set, but I didn&rsquo;t find any of the steps particularly challenging. As far as LEGO age rating goes they have this set at 12+, but I could certainly see kids younger than that with LEGO building experience being able to complete this set without many issues.</p>

<p>-SO MANY PRINTED PIECES!!! They did a great job minimizing the amount of stickers necessary by including a lot of printed pieces.</p>

<p>-In reading some other reviews I can understand where people might have been disappointed especially with some of the repetition for the side paneling. There were definitely points where the siding became repetitive and I think they could have broken some of that up by spreading out the external detail builds like the fish crates and interior details. But, I also take the mind &ldquo;is the repetition worth it in the end?&rdquo; and I think the side paneling details were absolutely worth it in the end.</p>

<p><u>Final Product:</u></p>

<p>-The interior details in this set are amazing! The store is literally details from floor to ceiling. The floors are green and brown tile with crossing designs. The walls have maps, fishing trophies, diving gear, chains, fishing rod racks, chest full of gear, a counter with till and product clutter. When I finished the interior build I just had to stop for a second and take it all in, it is amazing how much detail they packed into such a small space. The tower containing the captain&rsquo;s office also has a fair amount of detail.</p>

<p>-The exterior details are also exceptional in this set and I think round out the display really well. The base has great coastal detail with the rocks and raised wooden walkways. The signs, lamps, ship wheel, and side piping do a great job adding detail in otherwise bare spots.</p>

<p>-Probably my only real issue with this set was the interior size. The details are amazing, but with so much jammed in there it really reduces what you can do with the minifigs on the interior. Same problem with the tower, it has great detail, but it&rsquo;s so condensed you really don&rsquo;t get to see it without taking the top half of the tower off.</p>

<p><u>Overall Impression:</u></p>

<p>-This is a phenomenal set and a must buy for collectors. This ranks as one of my top LEGO builds and I would encourage anyone interested in this set to go ahead and purchase it. The only people I would discourage from buying this set are those looking for a more playable modular. I do think the interior size and issues accessing parts of the tower make this a sub-par LEGO set in terms of playability. But I also don&rsquo;t think that was really ever the intent with this particular set. If you are a LEGO fan looking for a new set to build and display I could not recommend this set more. If you are interested in spare pieces for a MOC this is also a great set due to the unique color palate and printed pieces. For the price, this is a great set for any LEGO fan.</p>

"piktor","2018-12-28T16:32:42.23Z","Overhyped","<p>I honestly wanted to like this set, as it looked&nbsp;great in the photos and it was clearly a unique opportunity to get such style/design set out of Lego through the Ideas. But I think this set could not live up to the standards of other sets with&nbsp;similar size and price.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think this is mainly due to the selfishly aesthetic design, which priorities look over everything else,&nbsp;combined with a very basic and repetitive&nbsp;building experience. The concept of this fake nostalgia and never-existed era was&nbsp;pushed way too far&nbsp;with this&nbsp;building.&nbsp;Lastly, you also feel&nbsp;some sort of hatred of studs from the designer as everything is&nbsp;excessively&nbsp;tiled.&nbsp;This may be okay for a MOC of yours but it should not be the case in&nbsp;any&nbsp;official Lego set.</p>

<p>Regardless, there is a huge number of parts and accessories. The shop is full of different equipments, so you have everything what your Lego figures would need if they ever go out for fishing.&nbsp;I also really like the color scheme&nbsp;and this set looks gorgeous on display, but do not attempt to play with it as access to the&nbsp;cramped interior is quite restrictive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great display piece but as a set it&nbsp;is miles away from Lego&#39;s DNA.&nbsp;Please Lego do not release any sets like this and leave these to the adult&nbsp;MOC builders.&nbsp;Everyone will be happier then.&nbsp;</p>

"pinz","2018-10-22T19:30:48.937Z","Nice Ideas set, lots of details","<h3>Building the set</h3>

<p>This set is build in about&nbsp;5 relaxed hours. A lot of nice ideas are included and even if some parts are repetitive (green tiles on the surface). A few steps are a bit to take care, but in overall it is not a hard set to build.</p>

<h3>The Parts</h3>

<p>Quite a few tiles, and 1x1 brick modified are in, but also some nice plates. I like the seagulls, they are a nice touch and lovely figures. Also a lot of details are here like the post-it tiles (1x1) or the printed treasure map.</p>

<p>Still there are a few stickers, why? Only LEGO knows.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>The Set itself invites to be played with and to be discovered by people who did not build it. So much is going on inside and outside, but I do not think this fisherman is going the best friend of the environmentalists, as he has a crate full of TNT standing there ;)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The set is lovely and highly detailed. Ideas is currently in my opinion the best line of LEGO, as it comes directly from fans and I have the feeling that also the designers from LEGO have the spirit and the freedom to give there best. Not like you see in other lines (Technic, Friends...) where it looks like that some sets are just developed under the premise to maximize the profit margin.</p>

<p>Would I&nbsp;recommend&nbsp;this set? Yes, fully.</p>

"legomandre42082","2018-12-10T21:52:55.18Z","Best way to prepare for a day on the sea!","<h2><b>Unique interpretation of a fishing store:</b></h2>

<p>People are typically not accustomed to what a legitimate fishing store, since they have died off over the years. However, RobenAnne, the creator of this Ideas model, portrayed a very unique and incredibly detailed building that would make anyone purchase equipment for&nbsp;their adventures at sea. It is amazing that Lego could incorporate so many one-of-a kind elements to show how impressive the model is. Plus, this going on sale during Black Friday only made me want to purchase this model even more. I am astonished that Lego had not thought of the set design before.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What I enjoyed about this&nbsp;set:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>I was amazed at the obscure, yet ingenious, building techniques for the model. This model was special, since it forced the builder to manipulate pieces to create a weathered and aged building. With its title stating it has been aged, the designers utilized various shades of brown to build the roof of the actual store, while angling them at the same time. They also utilized the rare turquoise colored tiles to make the building stand out among others on the shoreline. In addition, the designers angled the tiles to showcase the damage the building has gone through over the years.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The authenticity of the store also made the set so desirable&nbsp;among Lego city builders. A lot of Modular buildings made by Creator Expert create buildings that may be obscure when placed in a city, but the Old Fishing Store does not make any city designer question their decision when putting the model in their city. It flows really well with any building in the city and allows for any people visiting the building to feel satisfied when making a purchase. The store also has many unique elements inside of the store itself to showcase the many aspects of fishing. The store is very attractive from the outside and intrigues anyone nearby.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What I disliked about this set:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The thing that I disliked about the set was the cramped feeling inside the store itself. I noticed while constructing the model, I noticed that the designers spent too much of the steps on making an impressively detailed outside of the building, while causing the inside to be inversely miniscule and jammed with detail. This made the minifigures to be too close to all the items being sold and near impossible to be placed around the store. Albeit, the designers helped this problem by making the back of the model able to open in two levels and the roof can come off as well. However, these two drastic aspects of the model does not help in creating space to move the characters comfortably around the super-detailed store.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Would I recommend this set?</strong></h2>

<p>I was highly impressed by the original release of this model by its unique take on an uncommon building, which made many collectors intrigued in its concept. Although the model has been retired by Lego, I am adamant in saying that this model is not one to skip on. I would have gone to extreme lengths to purchase the model, even if it meant to purchase it for higher resell on Amazon or BrickLink. This model presents a turning point in Lego design and accuracy for later models conceptualized by designers at Lego and on Ideas. It set a benchmark for what fans of Lego can produce and what the future of Ideas is to come. It was effortless model to build and very satisfactory when it was completed.&nbsp;</p>

"Brentski","2019-01-20T16:36:11.2Z","Gone Fishin","<p>This is the biggest set I have purchased to date.</p>

<p>I have big plans for this set, as I am developing a costal town theme for my lego setup and this is the central focus. The uncommon colors in this set ring true, and also draw the eye, which then can&#39;t help but take in the scenery.</p>

<p>The set was&nbsp;purchased during the pre Christmas sales, so value increased dramatically. I would rate the value as good at retail price.</p>

<p>The set comes with four minifigs, which fit the set well. The kid minifig, which seems a little out of place, set the wheels in motion to add set # 31078, Tree House Treasures to the side as a play area keeping with the waterfront theme.</p>

<p>There are a lot of specialized parts/accessories, and lots of small parts to detail the set. At times the pieces seemed a bit tedious to place, but the end result is unquestionably gorgeous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building took about 8 hours during 5 sessions over a week, which is my perfect pace. In general, the pieces fit well, some of the finishing tiles took some coaxing. The tower and roof are detachable, and is a snug fit. The interior is crowded, and a bit small; rearranging the inside usually ends in knocking something off the wall.</p>

<p>The interior is nice, with an office, and store counter. Lots of accessories for sale! The back wall swings open for a great view inside, and the roof is removable also. A bit of bluh&nbsp;space where a spiderweb is placed underneath the store area. A nice touch is the numerous crates with tools, accessories, and animals.</p>

<p>I like the overall worn/rundown look, but didn&#39;t like how the roof layers. Many of the printed plank tiles overlay the roof proper in a way that looked odd to me, adding an extra layer at random spots. I ended up snapping them into the blank spaces on the roof, and adding some finishing tiles.</p>

<p>The tower is a great feature, the deck area at the base has &nbsp;great potential for play. I am looking to see if I can expand the upper ledge, it is only one dot wide which is tough to fit a minifig on, it would do better at two dots wide. A telescope on the upper deck fits awkwardly, and was the one dim spot in the set. The pieces designated for it fell apart easily, and I ended up substituting pieces to make it work.</p>

<p>Overall a fun set, have some more plans to customize. One or two minor things I would change, but hey... that&#39;s legoing!</p>

"c05","2021-05-10T01:32:59.037Z","Brilliant for play or display!","<p>The fishing store isn&#39;t technically a modular, but I think it fits right in the same area and modular fans will love this. It&#39;s actually more detailed than a modular in some ways because all four sides have something going on rather than the side and back just being blank so they can slot in with other buildings. There are a ton of small details and I love how accessible they made every part of the interior. This really helps the playability for kids, but at no point to the play features sacrifice aesthetics. One of the walls swings open and the roof comes off easily so you can get your characters in and even take pictures without trouble if that&#39;s your thing. The little staircase going from the main part of the store into the tower is a little too thing for an actual fig to fit in but that&#39;s a bit of a nitpick. The only real complaint I have is that I wish there were more studs on the foor of the shop as there are quite a few loose props sitting around that aren&#39;t connected down to anything. Other than that though, it&#39;s just about the perfect set, the visual style is striking and unlike anything else lego&#39;s done, and I&#39;m glad MOC designers have decided to run with it.<br />
<br />
The retail price of this is spot-on and if you can get it for $150 that&#39;s an excellent value for the amount of building you get. I don&#39;t think I would pay the 300+ resell price so I&#39;m glad I got mine when I did because this is excellent.</p>
