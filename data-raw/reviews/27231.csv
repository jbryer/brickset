"RoboticBricks","2020-05-07T19:38:30.157Z","A Fun Build & Great Promo","<p>This build was only available in North American LEGO Stores (July 2017) as a promotion after spending a certain amount of money (I believe it was $75 or more). It was supposed to be adults (18+) only and I found that my &quot;local&quot; LEGO store stuck to that policy.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The build was fairly straight forward and the pieces were already laid out, so no reaching over others trying to grab parts. Despite this being a &quot;free&quot; build, it had the same feeling as building a regular Brickhead&mdash;&nbsp;the LEGO group wasn&#39;t ripping anyone off with this. The instructions were printed on regular printer paper and were easy to follow.</p>

<p><strong>The Finished Product</strong></p>

<p>The finished build looks very good but lacks printed elements. They could have even included stickers that would&#39;ve made this build much more recognizable and accurate. I also feel disappointed they didn&#39;t include a printed tile (or sticker) on the base. Although I understand how this could be beneficial to anyone who didn&#39;t attend as they could build it without the worry of exclusive pieces/prints.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>All in all, this build gets 5 stars from me given that it was free and that I had a very pleasant building experience.</p>
