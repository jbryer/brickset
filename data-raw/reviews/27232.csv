"FowlerBricks","2017-10-18T21:47:13.19Z","It's a tiny Mech!!!","<p>I&#39;ve been seeing this set in a lot of reviews lately, and being rather partial to mechs, it was an instant must have. I waited, and waited and when my Walmart finally got them in, I was out of cash. But then a very generous Swapfig user stuck it in a trade as a bonus and here we are! Let&#39;s dive in.</p>

<p><br />
THE BAG AND INSTRUCTIONS<br />
This is actually a somewhat interesting subject, for once. The bag shows the Quake Mech thundering along in Ninjago City, leaving a line of cracked pavement in it&#39;s wake. The Ninjago Movie branding adorns the top of the package. Now, usually sets will have the the set number, the name and the parts count but strangely this set has no name! Just the set number and parts count.</p>

<p>The instructions are like normal polybag instructions but the thing I found interesting is the lack of Ninjago Movie sets advertised. None. At all. I found that a bit odd.</p>

<p><br />
THE BUILD<br />
Despite the fact that this is a polybag, the build is quite entertaining . When you crack open the bag and pour all the parts out, you will not instantly see how the thing goes together. All the pieces are very small, so it&#39;s very fun to watch the mech form out of seemingly nothing.</p>

<p><br />
THE COMPLETED MODEL<br />
This set is an excellent example of a microscale rendition of a larger model.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/jy1bq8rkj/Mech_With_Lloyd.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>It captures the look of the large mech perfectly and has decent poseability is the process (even more if you want to split the speakers in half)</p>

<p>The built-up wheel doesn&#39;t roll, of course, but you can still just slide it around and pretend that it rolls, since it slides so easily.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/wpfhwaqxf/Wheel.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The mech is also well balanced, allowing you to stand it up with little to no hassle.</p>

THE PARTS<br />
I decided to switch things up a little for this review and talk about the pieces here.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/7jejpj2ir/All_Parts.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>I highly that you grab two or three extra ones of these just for the parts. Along with some black dishes, a 1x2 clear tile, a 1x1 clear cylinder, black ingots, these things (https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6158469), some gold clips and a gold bucket handle, you get over 12 1x1 studs with holes, both on light bley and gold!</p>

<p><br />
OVERALL<br />
This is is extremely well-done and worth $3.99 or maybe even a little more. Five star set! Thumbs up! The only con for me is when posing the arms, some pieces can fall off if you are too rough. But then, at this size, it&#39;s a wonder that it&#39;s not flimsier, so I can&#39;t complain! Go buy it!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oh, all right, for the sake of not being too biased, I&#39;ll list the pros and some cons I&#39;ve heard mentioned by others.</p>

<p><br />
PROS: Excellent build.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An awesome selection of parts.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s a mech!<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#39;s cheap!<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great poseability for it&#39;s size.<br />
CONS: &nbsp;Tire doesn&#39;t roll.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The back lacks detail.<br />
I still think it&#39;s perfect and when the big one comes out, I&#39;m going to buy and display this alongside it! (well, if my wallet allows)<br />

My daughter (4yo) and I have been playing the Labyrinth board game and wanted a Lego figure to represent a minotaur, so this little set was perfect (as we don&#39;t have Minotaurus).</p>

<p>###Build<br />
It was too difficult for my daughter to snap the small pass-through studs on, but she enjoyed putting together the finished subsections.</p>

<p>###Play<br />
We were pleased with the amount of articulation the arms had based on the ball-in-socket design.&nbsp; The major downside is that it can only stand upright as the bottom is flat to allow standing on a &quot;ball.&quot;</p>

<p>###Overall<br />
A fun, quick build that will see hours of use within other games.</p>

<p>Comes in a polybag with normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some decent pieces in this set. You get a black bar, clear cylinder,&nbsp;a lot of studs with holes (Light grey and black), and a gold handle. Overall some decent parts for a polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy it took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:</b></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice mech. The wheel doesn&#39;t move but does provide nice stability for the mech. The arms provide nice mobility and move with a decent range. It moves 180 degrees front and back and 90 degrees left and right (Not bad for a polybag). Overall the look is good and resembles the larger version of it. The pieces you get are nice and add nice detail to the mech. I recommend getting this if&nbsp;you are a Lego Ninjago Movie fan or just a fan of mechs. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
