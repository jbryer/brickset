<p>There are a few nice little details - the box snaps shut in a very satisfying way and keeps all the contents safe. There is a cool hologram on the front of the pod and nice decor inside.&nbsp;My kids both picked one up with a CMF minifig and just love it.</p>

<p>The pod is given away with any Ninjago purchase so even if you buy only one of the CMF then you come away with 2 for th eprice of 1 - a bargain in my mind and hours of playtime for the kids.&nbsp;</p>
