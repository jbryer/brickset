<p>Volcano Garmadon features some great torso printing showing little images of his volcano lair and some clouds on his PJs, what is most unfortunate is that they did not make a new secondary torso for the upper body. This would have been a much better design, as it stands his back will forever have that odd armor on it since this upper torso has been flipped around during construction at the factory so the armor is located on the back instead of the front.</p>

<p>His printing carries onto his arms though and his legs, he includes a spoon and bowl accessory which is great and the head and helmet just looks so funny sitting on top of the Pyjamas he&#39;s seen in the film.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d recommend this minifigure because of just how much fun he looks. As a bonus you can MOC up some fun sleepover guests for the Sleepyhead from Series 6 if you&#39;d like.</p>
