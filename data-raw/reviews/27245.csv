<p>The build is very quick and simple, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;(like many I imagine) bought it to get hold of the printed Corn Flakes packet, and I&nbsp;love it! &nbsp;But that takes nothing away from Wu himself who is delightfully designed. &nbsp;The only thing i don&#39;t like is that the cloth apron does not wrap around the legs perfectly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figure is pretty easy to find in the blind bags due to his&nbsp;hat, so i did not spend a great deal of time finding him. &nbsp;Recommended.&nbsp;</p>

"SuperBrixBros","2017-11-08T20:16:16.513Z","Corn Flakes!","<p>Got this great minifigure&nbsp;a few weeks ago at wal-mart.</p>

<p><strong>Legs:&nbsp;</strong>These are almost completely plain, and to quote <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCI-GvuSX3Xsc82W4gY1BwxQ"">GNAJBRiCKS</a>&nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s tan&quot;. I do really like the sandals printed on his feet, but I wish the legs were either dual-moulded or just yellow with a white hip piece because the tan makes it look like he&#39;s wearing socks with the sandals.</p>

<p><strong>Cloth Skirt Thing:&nbsp;</strong>In the picture for this minifig&nbsp;they kind of hide the skirt behind the cereal box, and for good reason, too. The gray color on the cloth looks faded compared to the crisp, clear printing on the torso. The cloth doesn&#39;t wrap all the way around the legs, I think it should have had one more fold so it would overlap with itself. It does have a gray line all the way around the back and sides, which is cool.</p>

<p><strong>Torso:&nbsp;</strong>Nice printing here.&nbsp;Simple, but it does the job. The gray lining and white ties are&nbsp;continued here, even with some on the wrists. The secret ninja force logo is on the back of the torso in red. One of the hands that came with my figure has a small gray line on the outside of it, which is probably just an accidental misprint.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Beard:&nbsp;</strong>Just a white mustache/beard, like a fu-man-chu&nbsp;or something</p>

<p><strong>Head:&nbsp;</strong>Forehead wrinkles, chin wrinkles, cheek wrinkles, wrinkles under his eyes... A lot of wrinkles, I guess Wu is pretty old. He has thick, white eyebrows, a white mustache, and a little tiny white beard. All in all, It looks very similar to the face he had in the TV series sets.</p>

<p><strong>Hat:&nbsp;</strong>Normal tan rice hat, but as I only had gold ones before, this fine.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories:&nbsp;</strong>This is the reason I bought this figure. Lego cereal boxes (as far as I know) only appear in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/41118-1/Heartlake-Supermarket"">41118-1: Heartlake Supermarket</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71016-1/Kwik-E-Mart"">71016-1: Kwik-E-Mart</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75827-1/Firehouse-Headquarters"">75827-1: Firehouse Headquarters</a>&nbsp;all of which cost signifigantly&nbsp;more than $3.99 (or $3.97 as my Wal-Mart prices them). So getting this is great.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Feel &#39;n&#39; Find:&nbsp;</strong>If you&#39;re looking for this figure in the blind pack you want to feel for the hat first, but be careful! The hat is similar to the hat from&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71019-5/Garmadon"">71019-5: Garmadon</a>, so you might want to double-check by finding the beard or the cereal box before you buy it.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong>This figure is great, especially if, like me, you didn&#39;t have any Sensei Wu&#39;s&nbsp;before. The cereal box is a great addition to any Lego kitchen. Just get the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71019-7/Lloyd-Garmadon"">71019-7: Lloyd Garmadon</a>&nbsp;for the bowl and spoon and grab one of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-4619596"">these sets</a> and you&#39;ve got breakfast!</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all! Thanks for reading! :)</p>

"Odeinoichus","2018-05-14T15:49:57.21Z","Master Wu & Chicken?","<p><strong>Set #71019 Master Wu:</strong> The CMF series of LEGO Ninjago Movie includes Jackie Chan as Sensei Wu and one of the funnest accessories of all time. It&#39;s what really drives up the ratings on this figure.</p>

<p>Master Wu is pretty much what you&#39;d expect to see. He&#39;s got his white outfit, complete with lower-leg skirt piece, dual-sided printing for the detail work, his traditional hat and unique white bear element and some minor printing on his legs for his sandals (nothing else). He has no weapons, as a true Ninja Master can fight with only his hands when necessary, also the other accessory takes up a lot of space. It&#39;s a box of Corn Flakes as printed on the front of the large 1x2 brick.</p>

<p>Master Wu is just great, I strongly recommend him to the fans of the franchise and I also highly recommend him to folks who enjoy MOCs because that beautifully printed cereal box element is a must have for any Grocery Store chain, Family Kitchen or Dining Room and the price can&#39;t be beat.</p>
