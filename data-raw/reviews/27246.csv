<p>Nya is dressed in a generic looking Spinjitzu Training Gi, which is shared between all six of the ninjas and so is not gender specific in this figure. It&#39;s a white outfit with Sensei Wu stamped on the corner logo and on the back. Nya&#39;s costume looks great, her accessories include two brown katana as wooden swords, she has the same hair piece as her LEGO set counterpart and a single-sided facial expression with a smirking look on it.</p>

<p>Overall Nya represents a great character in a great variant outfit and I&#39;m a huge fan of her so I definitely recommend her. Her hair and swords are guaranteed to be easy to feel for when searching.</p>

"Brickking6077","2020-05-11T23:00:02.283Z","Has this one done enough training?","<p>The Lego Ninjago Movie had a large array of characters. So it only made sense to have a Collectible Minifigures Series follow suit. One of these is Nya decked out in practice garb. Can she pass the test?</p>

<p>Nya is wearing a Wu Cru gi that has appeared on almost every other ninja at least once. However, I am thrilled that it is featured here despite all of the other aforementioned figures. The consistent printing and clever usage is well worth the many inclusions such as this one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her katanas are not as special a weapon as I wish had been added. Her spear from the movie or a water-based weapon might have been a more exciting choice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The head is the same piece used all too often since the movie&#39;s release and should be more unique. As for Nya&#39;s hair, a different, somewhat relaxed&nbsp;hair feels like a&nbsp;better option.</p>

<p>I can see very little for the majority of buyers to enjoy here. Some smaller collectors may benefit from the price compared to other similar sets with this gi. However, most will go for this series&#39; rarer people.&nbsp;</p>
