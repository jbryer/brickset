"SuperBrixBros","2017-11-07T22:00:07.133Z","Nice Hoodie","<p>Just got this at wal-mart, and I don&#39;t regret it.</p>

<p><strong>Legs:&nbsp;</strong>Hips and legs are moulded in black with pockets and belt printed in brown. I like the idea of the jacket continuing down to the legs, but it doesn&#39;t look as good as it does in the picture and also makes them unusable for other figures without the torso as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Torso:&nbsp;</strong>Nice dark forest green coloring and the lighter green highlights look great! the white shirt underneath actually looks white, unlike some others where the base mould&nbsp;color bleeds through. The arms have green cuffs on the wrists which is fantastic, and the jacket zipper looks good even though it doesn&#39;t have much detail. No back printing.&nbsp;Overall this jacket is incredibly useful and detailed.</p>

<p><strong>Head:&nbsp;</strong>Yellow (of course), with very thick&nbsp;brown eyebrows (presumably from his <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71019-16/Volcano-Garmadon"">Dad&#39;s</a> side), a half smile, and green eyes. Hold up! <i>Green eyes?&nbsp;</i>That&#39;s right! Lego minifigures&#39; eyes are almost always black unless the figure happens to not be human or is from clone wars ore something. But even when Lego eyes are a different color, they&#39;re usually a different shape as well. Lloyd&#39;s eyes are the normal type but with green instead of black. I like that for the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/41487-1/Lloyd"">Lloyd Brickheadz</a>&nbsp;they did the same&nbsp;thing, normal brickheadz eyes but green.</p>

<p><strong>Hood:&nbsp;</strong>This minifigure&#39;s&nbsp;hoodie is just fantastic, I love every bit of it. The tan swath of hair poking out is slightly discolored, but it doesn&#39;t matter that much. The wrinkles all over the back and sides look fantastic.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Accesories:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bowl:&nbsp;</strong>Excellent moulding, and the blue dragon is&nbsp;nicely printed, very intricate. The blue rim all the way around adds a nice affect as well. It looks just like a classic Asian glass noodle bowl&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spoon:&nbsp;</strong>Nice detailing for this. It has the same handle as the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Friends"">Friends</a> line&#39;s forks, and I&#39;m not sure if it appeared in another set or not, but either way, this is a great piece. It kind of looks more like a little kid&#39;s toy spoon than a real spoon with the thick handle and scoop.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong>This figure is great, 5 out of 5. the bowl and spoon are great, especially paired up with Sensei Wu&#39;s corn flakes box. And the jacket is wonderful for any city display. The face is more unique, but still is useful. I fully&nbsp;recommend this minifigure&nbsp;for everyone. He seems to be harder to find as I felt though packages at different stores near me for quite a while, looking specifically for this guy, with no luck. But one of my local Wal-Marts recently re-stocked and I found him and the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/71019-16/Volcano-Garmadon"">Volcano Garmadon</a>&nbsp;(another one I was searching for) almost immediately. As I said, I&nbsp;fully&nbsp;recommend this minifigure&nbsp;for everyone.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all! thanks for reading this review :)</p>

"8BrickMario","2018-01-10T15:37:48.387Z","You can't be in hero mode all the time.","<p>While this is not the only civilian Lloyd minifigure, this is a unique combination of the more casual Lloyds&#39; attributes, and certainly the easiest way to get him in casual wear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This figure is definitely a standout for its pieces. All of them, save for perhaps his head, are easily applied to other characters and scenes, and the three new pieces included with him are nice to have. While technically his bowl is the only piece completely unique to this figure, the other new pieces aren&#39;t yet common.</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>This is Lloyd eating breakfast, with the corn flakes provided by Wu and being shared by his father, as the CMF series encourages a family breakfast scene. Lloyd&#39;s new hood piece is great, representing the third development of the LEGO hoodie (printed on back, piece for hood down, now a piece for the hood up), and the piece is really well molded to include some hair and it&#39;s cleverly shaped to look like it wraps inward toward his neck. However, the paint on the hood for Lloyd&#39;s hair&nbsp;is rather poor. At first I thought it was the wrong color altogether and they accidentally used Dark Tan, but it&#39;s not, it&#39;s just Brick Yellow painted with far too few layers and the dark green bleeding through. This light-on-dark paint problem is so frequent these days, and while it could be explained as the hood&#39;s shadow, it&#39;s still an issue. I almost wish this Lloyd was the one who got the hairpiece on the side, rather than ninja Lloyd.</p>

<p>The rest, however, is without flaw. Lloyd&#39;s face is simple but endearing, with his significant green eyes, and the torso and legs are excellent, showing his hoodie partially unzipped to reveal a white undershirt, and the lower edge sitting askew on his hips. His pants have a few nice details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lloyd&#39;s bowl and spoon are also very interesting. The spoon is nice, but the bowl is more exciting. It&#39;s a simple piece with some nice china printing, and while there are no connection points other than the bottom, a 1x1 stud can be placed neatly inside to represent food. The bowl really needs to be placed on a table in front of him to pose him eating it, as the spoon isn&#39;t long enough or the bowl isn&#39;t wide enough to pose him eating with the bowl in hand.</p>

<h3>Final opinion</h3>

<p>I think I&#39;d really like this figure if it was a bit more unique and didn&#39;t have the paint thinness on the hood, but it&#39;s still a perfectly solid figure. The hair paint just annoys me because the rest is so well-done, but if it doesn&#39;t bother you, I&#39;d recommend it.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2018-05-27T01:54:30.457Z","Lloyd really loves Cereal","<p><strong>Set #71019 Lloyd Garmadon:</strong> The CMF Series includes civilian clothed Ninja for most of the main characters. This is the cheapest way to get this figure, as he is included with altered facial prints in actual sets for the Movie, but if you just want a Lloyd in civilian clothing then picking up this figure is definitely worth it.</p>

<p>Lloyd pretty much looks the same here as in the 25$ Ninjago City set, the main difference here is that you get a different single-sided head, a brand new hooded head piece and a spoon and bowl accessory with some nice printing of a dragon on the bowl. Not really much else to discuss here.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend this one for the new parts mostly, as if you are buying the sets there&#39;s no real point in getting a figure with parts found mostly in the sets, still if you want a complete set of 20 you&#39;ll need to pick this one up.</p>
