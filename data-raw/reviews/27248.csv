According to my research, this would have earned him the distinguished title of <i>itamae</i>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;But I don&#39;t need to know all that; he&#39;s a LEGO sushi chef! For that alone, I had to have him.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Unsurprisingly, the parts are great. There are two sushi tiles, a new bandana&nbsp;head cap, the attractive torso and extremely useful dual-molded legs, and a really nice head. But for me, the big excitement was the cleaver piece, first seen with the Butcher minifigure, and just recently making a comeback. For this series&#39; run, the&nbsp;CMFs are once again the cheapest way to obtain one.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>The chef looks great. His striped bandana matches his uniform really nicely, and he has a kindly face well suited to his look. His torso has some great printing, looking like traditionally woven garb with printing of shrimp embroidery and a classic folded and belted/sashed&nbsp;style. His legs are simple but complete the look well. He comes with a roll of sushi that can actually be sliced by taking off the printed tile at the end of the 1x1 cylinder, and another individual piece of sushi. I almost lost both of these tiles multiple times, so be careful when opening the back and secure the parts. He would go perfectly in Ninjago&nbsp;City, if there was only a kitchen to supply the sushi conveyor, but with some creativity, you could make a cooking station for him.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Like the original<em> LEGO Movie&#39;</em>s&nbsp;CMF Series, this one has some great characters that can be put in other contexts, and this is definitely the strongest of them. He&#39;s a great design with easy application, and definitely worth it.</p>

<p>Sushi Chef features some dual-molded legs, a double-sided torso with a great looking print and a very intriguing re-use of the Pirate bald-pate head piece with the bandana, the accessories include some fun looking elements, a few printed circular tiles with Sushi rolls and a tube to simulate him slicing them off for the customers.</p>

<p>This is a great looking Minifigure from the Series and is definitely one you&#39;ll want to pick up. The parts are all perfect and considering how useful a lot of these Ninjago Minifigures look I&#39;m amazed we haven&#39;t gotten a regular Ninjago Series before this.</p>
