<p>Misako has a decent looking torso and let combination, the colours are nicely chosen and blend together well and the printing is all single-sided with the print carrying down from the torso onto the legs. Her hair is brand new in a nice orange tone, and she has a nice single-sided facial print with a decent smiling expression. Her accessory is a large purse, which looks great and I believe is new.</p>

<p>Overall I highly recommend her, while there are some who are not fans with this interpretation of the character her look and parts are all very nicely designed and can work as any number of regular civilians in LEGO City if you&#39;d prefer not to use her as Misako. Highly Recommended.</p>

<p>Bad</p>

<p>The Minifigure it&#39;s one of the cutest that I have but it doesn&#39;t have two faces and why the pants are so simple just two lines What?!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good</p>

<p>It&#39;s a important character and her hair is awesome and with her bag she looks ready to work. The Minifig it&#39;s good if you want something exotic and important.&nbsp;</p>
