"Human1229","2017-08-01T20:29:57.15Z","Its a Blue-and-Orange-Jay","<p>Played by Kumail&nbsp;Nanjiani in the movie, a Pakistani-American stand-up comedian, Jay the blue ninja is one of the main characters who also happens to be a ninja. I picked him up at the Lego Store today. Lets see how good a figure he is.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>Jay Walker is consisted of nine pieces, including his accesories. But let&#39;s not ignore the elephant in the room - the selfie stick. Though selfies were never my thing, I think it is interesting that Lego chose to make a selfie stick for not one - but two sets. (The other is the Harley Quinn Dorm Room for DC Superhero Girls.) This selfie&nbsp;stick is made of four pieces, including the phone. He also has a new scarf piece, my favorite part of the set, and a new hair piece. Underneath the scarf is a button-up jacket covering up a white polo shirt only visible without the scarf.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figure:</p>

<p>Jay has lightning patterns on his jacket, probably because he&#39;s the lightning ninja, and freckles on his grinning face. He is squinting, perhaps for the picture. He wears khaki pants and has a new curly hairdo in dark brown. His orange scarf wraps around his neck perfectly, but there is no printing on the back of his torso. His printed-on pant pockets are a nice touch. The phone has his face on it, as well as various buttons. There is a city skyline behind his face on the phone.</p>

<p>To feel for him, feel for a rod and then a couple more small pieces, then comfirm with a 1x2 tile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>Jay is one of my favorite minifigures in this series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here goes.</p>

<p>This minifigure is Jay Walker, AKA the Blue Ninja. He is one of 20 minifigures from the LEGO Ninjago Movie Collectible Minifigures theme. This minifigure&nbsp;includes a unique orange scarf piece and a hair piece similar to a version of Han Solo&#39;s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jay is holding a phone on a stand and taking a picture of himself.</p>

<p>This review isn&#39;t very good.</p>

<p>Reviews on minifigures are hard.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2018-05-27T01:47:53.307Z","Seriously, what a pun-tastic name.","<p><strong>Set #71019 Jay Walker:</strong> We now return to the reviewing of The LEGO Ninjago Movie CMF series with Jay in his civilian clothing. I never noticed before that his last name was Walker, which, when you think about it, makes for a very punny name for the Ninja of Lightning.</p>

<p>His print is relatively simple, with single-sided torso printing, minor printing for the pockets and a single-sided face. Along with his stunning new hair piece he looks very nice, factor in the inclusion of a brand new scarf piece to wear around the neck indicates that LEGO is really expanding on the Minifigure accessories. Speaking of which, a nice buildable selfie-stick with a printed tile for a cell phone round out the figure quite nicely and looks great.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d definitely recommend this figure, he&#39;s got a lot of nice re-useable parts for MOCing characters, and he represents, very faithfully, the civilian clothes of Jay Walker.</p>
