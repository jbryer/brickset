<p>Shark Army Great White features some really impressive print details, the firey rips and tears in his pants and top are made visible on his legs and arms. The rest of his costume is somewhat intact, and quite fun, even his air tank print shows that he&#39;s completely out of oxygen. For a weapon he has a flame-spewing charbroiled black fish, and his face expression is very angry. Overall a great looking menacing character represented in Minifigure form.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend this one too, in fact there are very from the Ninjago Movie Sub-Theme that I would not recommend, all of them have a lot of personality and character and are deserving of being owned, some however just have more charm and personality and this one is definitely one of the better chosen representatives of the film. Recommended.</p>
