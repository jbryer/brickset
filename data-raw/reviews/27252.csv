However, this contrivance is precisely what makes her a desirable figure, so I was eager to pick her up.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The pieces here are really nice, but for more specific contexts. Her reintroduction of the Zombie Businessman hair in black is nice, and her face is great, but the majority of her parts, while fantastic, are better suited to fantasy war scenarios like the movie&#39;s own. The big attraction to me, however, was her drink cup, which is printed to depict boba (bubble tea) inside! That&#39;s a great piece to have for any Ninjago civilian, and I might look into getting a few more just for that. While it&#39;s not a Japanese drink, it&#39;s still a great touch.</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>Shark Army General #1 is clearly worried about losing her fragile recent title, but she definitely looks the most qualified, with her resplendent sailfish uniform. Her hair is clever, representing what looks to be a messy half-shaved style, which is achieved merely by rotating the Zombie Businessman hair to a different angle. Her face is suitably nervous, with a look of weak happiness. The uniform is great, done in shades of blue with tasteful gold and silver accents, and it is suitably majestic while looking practical for mobility. Medals and a sash decorate the jacket, and the lower half has some nice scales. She has a unique cape made to look like a fish&#39;s frilly fins, consisting of two pieces of thin plastic. This is the perfect material for the idea, and the profile of the cape isn&#39;t something we&#39;ve seen before. White gloves complete the look. Her accessory is the bubble tea she&#39;s seen anxiously sipping&nbsp;when reporting to Lord Garmadon, which, judging by the slurps,&nbsp;is far past being full&nbsp;when we see her. It&#39;s a great inclusion.</p>

<h3>Final opinion</h3>

<p>She&#39;s a great looking minifigure, who encompasses both the suprisingly classy designs of the movie and the typical silly humor of the LEGO brand. I&#39;d definitely recommend her.</p>

With the LEGO Ninjago Movie CMF Series we begin to get into the villains under Garmadon with this #1 SAG... which is an unfortunate acronym for an unfortunate character.</p>

<p>This Minifigure looks quite unlike anything I&#39;ve seen before, it&#39;s a very cleverly designed print for the overall uniform of the Shark Army General. It&#39;s a single-sided torso, but it looks great with a rich dark blue colouring and a lot of decorated tassels and medals and things attached beneath her sash. Her legs have a fin/fish-like scale pattern, and her unique new elements, the hair, the plastic cape and extra smaller collar element really stand out as fun and cleverly designed. Her facial expression is also nervous, as she&#39;s faced with failing Lord Garmadon.</p>

<p>Overall this is one of the greatest looking figures in the line and a must-have character. I strongly recommend her, her parts add to her unique look quite nicely and I just can&#39;t wait to see if LEGO re-uses them. The squishee cup accessory with the new paint job and markings looks great too.</p>
