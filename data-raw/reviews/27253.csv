<p>G&amp;G Rocker includes dual-molded legs so you can have torn ripped black jeans/pants with white sneakers underneath. His red shirt is printed with a great skull and crossbones design and his arm includes a tattoo on the shoulder. His hair was first used with the LEGO Hippie in Series 7, this time it&#39;s in black with a red headband, he also includes the rock guitar accessory in red with white and silver detailing. He also features double-sided facial expressions, with one serious looking expression and the other in mid-song.</p>

<p>Overall this is a pretty decent looking figure and I&#39;m pleased to have him in my collection. I&#39;d definitely recommend him, if nothing else than for his parts, since they are so versatile for fans of MOCing figs.</p>
