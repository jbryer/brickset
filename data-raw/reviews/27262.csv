The woman there was nice enough to help me feel for the highly sought-after N-Pop Girl. Though it took us forever to find one, in the end we ended up with 2!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>The N-Pop Girl comes with 6 very colorful parts; &nbsp;a tutu, a teddy bear, a shirt with Unikitty&#39;s&nbsp;face, pigtails (that are reminiscent of cotton candy), striped pants, and a very cheery face.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifig:</p>

<p>Probably inspired by J-POP or K-POP, she appears to be an idol in Ninjago&nbsp;City, judging by her minifigure name. She wears mismatched boots with hearts at the toe and&nbsp;striped pink and white bottoms that look like pajama bottoms. Her shirt will probably be the reason for many Lego fans wanting her, it has Unikitty&#39;s&nbsp;face on it! She also wears a pink and blue necklace. On the back of her torso the necklace continues, as well as two stars and three hearts on the back of her shirt.&nbsp;Her hair is a reuse of Harley Quinn&#39;s hair from The Lego Batman Movie, except with pink and sky blue coloring. It also has a hole to put Friends hair accessories in.&nbsp;She holds an adorable teddy bear with eyelashes and blue stripes on its belly. Her tutu is white on the underside, and striped with white and pastel colors on top. She is wearing what appears to be blush, as well as big eyelashes. Barely noticable with her hair on, she also has raised eyebrows to make her appear even more happy. The stripes of her pants do not continue onto the back, however the boots do. Like most others in this series, she has no alternate face.</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p><br />
N-POP Girl is an adorable figure, with referencing to The Lego Movie&nbsp;and such pastel colors, many people are likely adding&nbsp;her in their wish list right now.</p>

The N-Pop (all caps for some reason in the offical name) Girl was my instant must-have and she does not disappoint.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;m gonna be honest, while all of the parts are great, they&#39;re very limited-use, especially because the torso has some visible yellow skin, so you can&#39;t even transplant the design on a flesh-toned minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>It&#39;s clear that this is a tribute to the more extravagant and bright fashions that feature in Japanese culture, and I love it. While it&#39;s never clear if she&#39;s an N-Pop (Ninjago pop, like K-pop) star or just a fan, she doesn&#39;t need to be either, as she&#39;s a great example of the crazy fashion and cute theming&nbsp;exhibited in parts of Japan. Her hair is a perfect reuse of Harley Quinn&#39;s, in pink and blue, and her excited blushed face is just right. She has a bouncy, girly outfit with a multicolored tutu and a great Unikitty shirt, plus some striped tights and colorful boots. The colors aren&#39;t too intense, and are balanced out well with yellow and green to avoid being too pink or blue. I just wish the pattern on the tutu was even all the way around. Her bear is sweet, and invites comparison to the Series 12 Spooky Girl. Both have a Japanese vibe, striped tights, striped bears, and an inverse approach to color. Interesting</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Final opinion</h3>

<p>She&#39;s just a delightful figure that&#39;s done just right and is a joy to look at. She adds some color to the line, and she&#39;s just fine outside its context.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2018-06-08T23:53:38.667Z","Unikitty's Biggest Fan.","<p><strong>Set #71019 N-POP Girl:</strong> And now we come to the final figure to be released as part of the CMF Ninjago series. N-POP Girl is a clear fan of everyone&#39;s favorite LEGO Movie Unicorn Cat combination... She&#39;s also one of the most colorful residents of NINJAGO City.</p>

<p>N-POP Girl re-uses the tutu element from the Ballerina with some new colours printed on and dual-molded legs which uses a light blue colour for her left boot and a lime green colour for her right boot, this is only the second time I can recall with dual-molded legs where the feet end with different coloured plastics. Her torso is dual-sided with a print of a top that includes Unikitty front and center. She has a single-sided smiling face, a re-use of Harley&#39;s hair in a mixture of pink and light blue and a pink teddy with printed striped tummy.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend N-POP Girl for her parts, like with most of the characters, but I also recommend her as a solid looking Minifigure from the Series with a great assortment of colours and design elements that come together very nicely. Not jarring or too busy for the eye. Definitely recommended.</p>
