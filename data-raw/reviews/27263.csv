<p>Lloyd is dressed fully in his Ninja Gear in the CMF Series, which makes it the cheapest method to get Ninja Lloyd for your NINJAGO Minifigure collection. All of the printing is the same as what you&#39;d see in any of the larger sets. For his accessories you get a spare hair piece, a sword with a gold tassle on the end and a printed tile with blueprints for his Dragon Mech head. The new Ninja mask is a two piece style, with a face mask similar to the facial masks from recent years of the Ninjago theme and a new top element that finishes the full facial mask.</p>

<p>Some of the printing is difficult to make out because of the black colouring of the figure, but overall this is a pretty great looking version of Lloyd and is only 4$, unless you find some on clearance as there are some retailers overloaded with a lot of this series still despite it being Summer 2018.</p>

<p>Ahem. I&#39;d recommend this guy for your collections, if you&#39;re a fan of Lloyd you&#39;ll love getting this guy. Definitely don&#39;t miss out.</p>
