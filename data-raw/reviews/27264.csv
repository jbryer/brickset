That's it.","<p>I got this Garmadon primarily for his expression, because it&#39;s the closest to his original form. The rest is just extra, because I plan to get him in his full battle gear.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The head has a unique focused angry expression and the hat is in black. The bladed topper to his staff is also nice, but other Garmadons have the body pieces in some combination.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>Garmadon here isn&#39;t any setup I can recall, so he may not even be in this exact gear in the movie. He&#39;s definitely more casual than his warlord setup, but more protected than his jungle outfit, so maybe this is his own training gear? The hat is pretty basic and not really useful in black, but &quot;evil spooky&nbsp;Garmadon&quot;&nbsp;so okay. His face is nice, being a straight-up angry grimace. It&#39;s a bit cartoonish, but it works. It&#39;s very much like his original face, just with some slightly changed proportions and the change from silver line detail to grey.</p>

<p>His upper torso has what appears to be a new armor shape which has shoulder flares and a flat section of plating at the front. This is printed with armor and what looks like tails of his full-size battle robe, but I&#39;m not really sure what it represents. His lower/main torso is very similar to the original Garmadon, but with more ribs, a different belt design in dark blue, and like the face, grey lines instead of silver. I like that with the war helmet from another Garmadon, you could take the head and lower torso and legs to recreate the idea of the original. (Just don&#39;t ask me where the muscles come from on Jungle Garmadon if he&#39;s got skinny ribs here. It&#39;s probably just a nice reference to the original, since it&#39;s mostly hidden.)&nbsp;The legs are different from the older one in that the belt has a knot that continues onto the legs instead of just a waist twist.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Garmadon&#39;s pole weapon is simple, with a relatively new piece, but the best thing about it is that he can hold it upright with both of his left or right hands. That&#39;s very amusing to me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Final opinion</h3>

<p>This Garmadon is mostly a nice source of relatively desirable parts. I would argue for him being a way for kids to get him, but this isn&#39;t really close enough to his main look, and they&#39;d have to get Volcano Garmadon&nbsp;as well if they wanted to approximate his full gear. I don&#39;t regret having him, but he&#39;s mostly filler.</p>

Although I believe this is meant to represent his Flashback Battlefield Outfit.</p>

<p>The image on the site fails to capture a flaw with Garmadon&#39;s printing, that being that the blue is a darker shade and the print seems to have missed out on being fully realized as it is hard to make out without a strong lighting display. The dark blue on black just does not stand out and is barely visible unless you&#39;re in a strongly well lit room.</p>

<p>He does include the extra torso element with other arms, this Garmadon hasn&#39;t been cured of his venom infection from the bite of the great Serpent God. He&#39;s wearing a traditional hat element similar to Master Wu and wielding a large blade-tipped staff weapon.</p>

<p>If you want a Garmadon this is the cheapest way to get him. I recommend him despite the flawed printing colour choices.</p>
