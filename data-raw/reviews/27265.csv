This isn&#39;t Garmadon as he ever was, but as he might have been. That being said, the silliness of this demonic overlord dressed as a seventies dad was irresistible.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The pieces on this are fine, but the only truly uncommon and versatile element is the hair, which has not appeared often in that color. Neither torso is applicable to anything else, but the pants are alright, if a bit generic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>He looks great. I love the hair, the face, and the outfit (complete with mega-tie hanging down his extended body), and the four dual-molded arms really help. My big problem with all of the casual Garmadons in this theme is that they all use the bare-shouldered armored torso extension, with the armor being used as the back side here. That&#39;s not only a bit lazy, but it creates an unsightly back view on all of the figures. Why they didn&#39;t take the great opportunity to make a completely vanilla torso extension, I don&#39;t know. The only argument could be that the armor on the back keeps the top torso aligned,&nbsp;but that&#39;s a moot point for me, and I would much rather see a completely unarmored one. He comes with a picture of the volcano with a picket fence, reading &quot;Home&quot; in Ninjagoese, and it seems that this is his &quot;dream home&quot; before he decides to turn it into an evil operations base. Again, this never happened, but it&#39;s a cute touch. The camera is sweet, like he&#39;s captivated by documenting his family and baby.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Final opinion</h3>

<p>He&#39;s a really silly minifigure, and could even be used as a modern-day civilian in Ninjago City, maybe as a post-reform Garmadon or something. I really enjoy him despite some technical decisions, and I recommend him to fans of the movie.</p>

<p>Flashback Garmadon is using dual-molded arms for a shirt and tie look with his four arms. He includes minimal printing, but the attention to detail is superb and the accessories add to the overall look of the character, the camera with the printed tile featuring his volcano lair as a picturesque looking white picketed fence home is just pure comedy gold. Add the overgrown shades, the goofy blonde hair and his signature smirk and Flashback Garmadon is just all-around great fun.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d recommend getting him, his parts will certainly come in handy and you can&#39;t go wrong with a regular clothes wearing Garmadon for some fun stop-motion Ninjago battles.</p>
