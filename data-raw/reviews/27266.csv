<p>The Movie version of Kai includes a new hair style and facial expression which carries into future Ninjago Theme sets, his torso is double-sided with some nice detailing for his Gi and the armour piece included slides over quite easily. His helmet is also included as a spare head piece and you get two Kendo Sticks for him to wield.</p>

<p>Kai doesn&#39;t look too bad and as the first on the checklist he&#39;s not a disappointment for fans of the character. All-in-all he&#39;s a great variant though I do not recall him wearing this in the actual film, it&#39;s possible I just missed it, but as it stands if you&#39;re going for all the variants of the characters from this line you&#39;ll need to pick him up. Recommended.</p>
