<p>GPL Tech features huge glasses on her face with very large eyes behind them, her legs are dual-molded to better represent the long trailing labcoat she&#39;s wearing. What&#39;s fun about this Minifigure is the Batman Logo T-Shirt she&#39;s wearing underneath her labcoat. This means she must be a huge fan of LEGO Batman. Her accessories are the typical red coffee mug and the less typical labtop element.</p>

<p>Overall, this figure looks great. She&#39;s unfortunately a bit of a generic looking figure, but that too can be a good thing considering the multiple uses these parts can have for MOC figs. Definitely recommend this figure.</p>
