"Michel_Ange","2017-08-13T22:49:05.47Z","An excellent fig, perfect for many uses","<p>For itself, the fig makes for an excellent Shark Army soldier, with very finely printed torso and legs (front only, the back is left plain but partially covered by the air tank), an interesting female face with a scar on the temple, a solid and detailed air tank with small battery display, a fearsome fishmace (macefish ?) and a hilarious anglerfish... hat ? helmet ? head ?<br />
<br />
If you tear it apart, you&#39;ll get a very good diving/space suit in muted colors that&#39;ll blend in most modern or futuristic environments, a face that fits almost every female adventurer role, a fish, a rare medieval mace, and first and foremost, an anglerfish (you&#39;ll need a black or trans-clear head to put inside it it, and maybe a round 1x1 trans-clear plate to act as a stand).<br />
<br />
Hands down the most versatile fig in this series, and one of the most versatile collectible minifigs ever.</p>

"SuperBrixBros","2017-09-20T02:13:47.437Z","Neat Minifig","<p>Picked this up at Wal-Mart today and loved it.</p>

<p>Legs: Not much to say here, just some sand blue coloring at the top, some dark grey detailing further down, a couple straps with buckles on light bluish grey&nbsp;legs and hips, and a black belt.</p>

<p>Torso: Sand blue with light bluish grey arms and black hands and a hybrid utility belt/harness printed on it. There&#39;s also a zipper and a little orange circle which might be a light of some sort?</p>

<p>Armor: Pearl dark grey with a nice mould representing an oxygen tank in the back and some nicely textured tubes around the side. The print on the front shows two tiny rectangular icons and a &quot;battery almost full&quot; display</p>

<p>Head: Female face with a hard-to-read expression. Determined? Smug? IDK, anyway it has some eyeliner and a scar running down from the top of the head past the right eye. Could be useful for female warrior custom minifigures as most of my (and probably everyone else&#39;s)&nbsp;female heads are the generic smiling one from Lego City.</p>

<p>Headgear: This is where this minifig shines. The anglerfish&nbsp;mask is expertly moulded&nbsp;in sand green&nbsp;with a tailfin, a top fin, and two side fins on the back. on the front it has two tiny rows of teeth colored white, two eyes printed with black targets on white background, and the iconic bioluminescent (first try) dangly thingy. It&#39;s the first lego&nbsp;minifig&nbsp;scale realistic anglerfish! Just slap it on the head from&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71017-14/Orca"">Orca</a>&nbsp;from the Lego Batman Movie CMF series and voila! Anglerfish!</p>

<p>Weapon: A fish, with a dark pearl grey bar and spiky mace piece (seen previously in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71011-3/Frightening-Knight"">Frightening Knight</a>&nbsp;from CMF series 15) inserted into it to create a long mace taller than the minifigure itself.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s all! Thanks!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2018-06-01T22:50:58.963Z","Escaping from the Depths, it's the dreaded Angler!","<p><strong>Set #71019 Shark Army Angler:</strong> A huge surprise for me when I first got this CMF was that it represented another female villain from the LEGO Ninjago Movie, this time a generic female soldier in Garmadon&#39;s Shark Army, truly a pleasant surprising discovery.</p>

<p>The Angler is dressed in a female variant of the Octopus outfit, the print features curves on the torso to represent the female form, but most of the rest of the details are quite similar in colour and design to the Octopus. Her weapon however is a single fish holding a spiked mace, then we come to her head piece which is menacing and could easily double for an Angler Fish in an Aquarium if placed on a generic black or dark blue minifigure head and added to some scenery.</p>

<p>I would definitely recommend her, and if you&#39;re looking for some great parts for some MOC figures these generic Shark Army characters are very useful especially when on discount. Strongly recommend this one.</p>
