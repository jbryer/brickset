<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Cole&#39;s pieces are pretty nice, with the new hairpiece and the updated boombox, though his pants don&#39;t really work without the torso, and that is pretty Ninjago-specific.</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>Cole is here in his everyday high-school attire, and he&#39;s pretty nice. His hair is long and messy, yet distinct from Lloyd&#39;s,&nbsp;and I can see the piece getting a lot of use. His face is a bit odd, resembling an angry grimace, but I think he&#39;s probably supposed to be rocking out to his music. A more excited&nbsp;pose will help with that idea, because the promotional photo is a bit odd, and I wish he had a more neutral second face. Unsurprisingly, he keeps his signature eyebrows. Cole wears a tank top in his everyday life as well as during ninja work, and his is a tour shirt for a band even those not fluent in Ninjagoese should recognize from the text. The back has a nice tour list, with a red &quot;SOLD OUT&quot; stamp in English across it. Given that the band had absolutely nothing to do with the film, it&#39;s a bit of an odd reference, but I like that it&#39;s there. His shirt continues onto his hips , messily interacting with his belt, but the rest of the legs are plain black. Cole&#39;s boombox is very similar to the Series 3 Rapper&#39;s, but updated to have a music player (totally not an iPod, guys)&nbsp;dock instead of a cassette system.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Final opinion</h3>

<p>Cole is worthwhile just because he&#39;s exclusive, but he has some decent parts. Of the casual ninja, he&#39;s not my favorite, but with another head, he can be more useful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is really minimalistic for the leg prints, since the waistline with some visible belt is the only thing here, but the torso is really intriguing. I&#39;m not well versed on the Ninjago universe, but apparently this is for some kind of concert thing, judging by the back. There&#39;s a stereo/boombox accessory and Cole&#39;s new hair piece, his head is single-sided with a scowling expression.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d recommend him for the parts again, he&#39;s not as interesting as some of the other characters. He is one of the main characters though, so if you want all the Ninja in their civilian clothes you&#39;ll need this one.</p>
