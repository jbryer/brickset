<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Zane has some really nice pieces. There&#39;s his new hair, which is easiest to get here, and his backpack, pants, and sweater can all be applied to different figures.</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>This Zane is not a robot, and is very quick to remind you of his absolute normalcy. So say nothing about his alarmingly artificial eyes, rectangular eyebrows, and disconcerting smile. He&#39;s a normal teenager, people!</p>

<p>I love how obvious his...<i>totally regular features</i>&nbsp;are, and the gag in the movie about his implausible deniability--er, totally valid claims--&nbsp;plays off the design well. Credit to the facial design making his nature clear while still looking relatively--I mean, completely-- human. His hair is&nbsp;nicely drawn from the flat-top piece he previously used, and the white color is a nice change. His head has some great printing to imitate a shaved style, completing the look. His sweater vest and shirt represented by his torso are nice, and the Pluuvian Brain Beasts on his vest are a great callback. His pants are simple, but appropriate.</p>

<p>Zane&#39;s only accessory is his backpack, which is an odd choice. I think they were aiming for a school bag, but it&#39;s clearly camping gear what with the bedroll and all. Nevertheless, it&#39;s still nice, and perhaps it&#39;s a yoga mat in this case. Oddly, it works pretty well to complete him.</p>

<h3>Final opinion</h3>

<p>He&#39;s a great addition to any city scene, as he fits in so perfectly with any other normal human people. Get him to fill out your scenes of human beings doing human being things like normal humans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Okay, enough kidding. He&#39;s really striking and a great minifigure for collectors, and Ninjago City owners. I really recommend him.)</p>

<p>Zane&#39;s print looks great, I love the simple pants print on his legs and that sweater looks like a horrible choice in clothing. His new hair piece could almost be used for the Head of the Alpha Team Leader if it was ever made in the right colours, but here it&#39;s great for the robotic Zane. He has a single-sided face, but there is back printing on the head with what looks like some of his hair having been shaved and is in the process of growing back, either that or its some kind of CPU style printing hearkening to the nature of his robotic origins.</p>

<p>Decent enough figure, I&#39;d recommend him, much like the rest of the civilian Ninjas from the CMF for MOC parts and to have a complete set of 20.</p>

<p>This minifugre&nbsp;(who is&nbsp;called Zane)&nbsp;is a nice addition to the collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get into the details:</p>

<p>The hair piece is very nice, and the head is also good because it&#39;s only one-sided which then allows you to use his hair piece without seeing another face on the back. The sweater is a really cool design and is&nbsp;exclusive to this set, and so too are the pants. There is no printing on the back because Zane has a backpack. The backpack is a plain grey with some pockets and a red blanket&nbsp;rolled up on top.</p>

<p>I would recommend&nbsp;this set primarily for fans of Lego Ninjago.</p>
