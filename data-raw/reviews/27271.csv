<p>The SAO features a single-sided torso print with leg printing for an underwater wetsuit that is quite different from something you see in the real world. He also includes a new breathing tank element which adds some printing on the front for the air level in the tank. His accessories include a stud-shooter and a fish... really silly weapon, but it&#39;s standard Shark Army weaponry judging by what we see in the sets.</p>

<p>The new head piece has seven legs, not eight, which means this Octopus helmet is missing one of the limbs, but I suppose that makes sense considering Garmadon came up with the look of his army, he probably thought it would be cool or something.</p>

<p>Overall I like the look of this figure and recommend him.</p>

<p>The shark army octopus is a nice figure but not particularly unique in the long run .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>He has a very strange but cool octopus head attachment ( highlight of the fig ) with eye printing , his head has a grumpy expression and a scar above his eye , they have a gun metal grey air tank and a printed torso which leads into the legs .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>His accessories include a dull silver fish and a boring light grey stud shooter with three extra studs in Trans orange . His stand is the standard black CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a fine figure but personally I would prefer to get th jay or sushi chef from the series instead but it is not a bad figure but doesn&#39;t stand out with the other shark army figures littered throughout the Ninjago movie wave .&nbsp;</p>
