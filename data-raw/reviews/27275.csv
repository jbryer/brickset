Immediately following came The LEGO Batman Movie, the film has not garnered as much success as The LEGO Movie. However it was quite popular and has given rise to some impressive sets. The film itself however, is it worth adding to your collection? This review will strive to answer that question.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Presentation</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The packaging is different through many countries. This version of The LEGO Batman Movie was made available through Amazon.ca in Canada, but was a Target exclusive in the States. It includes the Blu-Ray, DVD and Digital HD copies of the film along with a selection of bonus materials and two bonus items, three collectible postcards and the Batgirl Polybag.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Batgirl Polybag has already been reviewed by me and can be found on its separate page in the database. The figure is very well done with great detailing and new facial expressions and is a suitable bonus item to include with this film, unlike other specials that have had lacking figures, or no figures offered at all.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The postcards are a fun little diversion, one is for NYC with LEGO Batman on the front, I should also note that the buildings seen on the postcard are actually made using existing LEGO models, in keeping with the in-universe depiction of everything being made of LEGO.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The Taj Mahal graces the front of a second postcard with Batman and Robin in front, a very amusing image. The third postcard features Batman in a cowl and speedo (a Minifigure which does not exist, yet, but would make for an awesome add-in or candidate for a second series of CMF figures. He appears to be in Copacabana, but the sets being used appear to be Heartlake City/Friends Beach themed, which means LEGO Batman may have taken a wrong turn on his way to his destination and wound up in LEGO Friends world.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Contents</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The film itself is highly entertaining and I&rsquo;m not about to review it extensively or offer spoilers here if you haven&rsquo;t already seen it. I will say though that many critics are right when they say it isn&rsquo;t as good as The LEGO Movie, that being said it has much to live up to after the smash hit success of the first film and nothing could ever hope to achieve the same level of success while following the same formula.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">For additional material you have some shorts, which are equally entertaining, a commentary which looks to be very fun and informative (At the time of this review I still haven&rsquo;t listened to it personally, though I intend to shortly.) and of course the usual behind the scenes elements and trailers and the like. A very fun package all around digitally and highly enjoyable.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This is the best version to get value wise, not only do you get a Minifigure from the film to enjoy, but you have all three copies of the film in which to watch any at your leisure. DVD, Blu-Ray or Digital HD. There&rsquo;s also the added bonus of the three amusing postcards to collect. It&rsquo;s an overall great package and a brilliant film, I highly recommend it if you are a fan of LEGO films in general.</span></span></span></span></p>
