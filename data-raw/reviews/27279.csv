"AddictedToStyrene","2017-11-12T09:31:06.953Z","I'm a piranha! I live in the Amazon!","<p>This set has become my favourite for 2017. (Ninjago City is technically a better set but cost 18 times as much.) The Piranha craft is the star and is brilliantly put together. The minifigures are great and the rickshaw looks cool, although it scales too big. It&#39;s great for the Ninjago Movie theme and also reminds me of something Grue or Megamind would build.</p>

<p><strong>Main build: the Piranha</strong></p>

<p>The piranha is based on some large pieces of Lego: boat hulls. You could probably come up with a pleasing design which used more pieces but the hulls make for a solid looking craft (Mech? Bot?) that fits nicely into the Shark Army design scheme. The guts of the model are small plates and hinges, with technic parts for the legs, periscope and weapon stubs. The larger head part is attached to the base with click hinges, allowing it to open up wide enough for the Shark Army driver to sit inside.&nbsp;Matched yellow cylinders and round tiles make up two canisters at the rear which might be fuel tanks or power pods. The main parts are Sand Blue, with a mix of other colours including&nbsp;greys, black and yellow.</p>

<p>The piranha stands on long feet, built upside down with yellow plates and tiles. There&#39;s a good amount of sideways articulation to keep this beastie standing. Armaments comprise two kinds of missile plus great gnashy teeth made from modified plates in white. The eyes of the piranha are trans clear 4 X 4 domes on round &#39;ring&#39; plates. Unusual pieces include yellow 1 X 1 round plates with holes, a 1 x 2 black slope printed in green as a control panel in Ninjago language,&nbsp;and the boat hull pieces which are in a colour exclusive to this set.</p>

<p><strong>The Rickshaw</strong></p>

<p>The second part of the build is the rickshaw which is cleverly put together. It looks lovely but it is&nbsp;too big for minifigures. Two car bonnets (hoods) make the canopy and a variety of plates and hinges fold together for the body. The lanterns, made from black &#39;palm tree&#39; pieces&nbsp;and trans yellow cylinders are a nice Ninjago-esque detail.</p>

<p><strong>Stickers</strong></p>

<p>The stickers aren&#39;t mandatory but add a bit of Asian inspired detail to the rickshaw and quasi military detailing for the mecha-fish. Applying them was simple but small kids might need help with the stickers that completely cover their pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The four figures are a nice selection for a set this small. Kai has some nice red detail printed on his black legs. The rickshaw driver has a harried expression - probably from hauling that giant vehicle around N. City. Lady Iron&nbsp;Dragon has great printing but is let down by her face being painted yellow on black, looking a little faded, and the Shark Army soldier wears a dark orange knitted cap and eye-patch (&quot;How does [he] even see these?&quot; &quot;He turns.&quot; &quot;Sounds exhausting.&quot;)</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Overall it&#39;s a great set with a hilarious&nbsp;fishbot and good set of figures. The only minuses are the rickshaw is too big and the yellow print on a black minifigure head looks a touch faded. Still my favourite set for the year.</p>

<p>This is a great set, great value for money, and IMHO comes close to Ninjago City Chase (70607) in bang-for-buck. If you like ridiculous vehicles, it actually surpasses this set. The build is fun, although applying the stickers to the canopy of the riksha is a pain, due to all the curves. Great set, and a necessary addition to complete the Shark-Army vehicle collection.</p>

<h2>Building experience</h2>

<p>The set took me some time to complete, mostly because I was building slowly, and the application of the riksha roof stickers was a pain. The riskha is a small build, but a gem. The stickers definitely add to the looks of the cart. I can actually imagine trying to source the parts in different colours to populate a street, and give it some variety.</p>

<p>The Piranha mech is one of the craziest vehicles in the Shark Army, but a lot of fun to build.A creative use of parts (aircraft fuselage and tail), it is well designed. The hinges allow for a conapy-open and canopy-closed display showing off the driver (a regular Shark Army thug).</p>

<p>There are 12 stickers in this set, and younger builders might actually need help to properly apply the stickers.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>Kai and the Shark Army thug are not unique (Kai is also found in 70608 Master Falls). Kai is also the only minifig with an alternate face.&nbsp;Ray (the riksha &#39;driver&#39;) is apparently unique to this set.</p>

<p>Currently Brickset gives&nbsp;Lady Iron Dragon (on the box named Misako)&nbsp;as unique to this set as well, but that seems to be a database error. She is also found in the Quake Mech (70632), and I have compared the two. To me they look identical.</p>

<p>Ray is similar to many of the Ninjago City inhabitants clothed in traditional garb. Lady Iron Dragon has a very nice armour print on the front and back of the torso, and a cloth complement. The quiver with&nbsp;shoulder armour and the helmet are very nice. The face print is nice (in general), but has one problem. The background colour is black, which actually bleeds through the yellow skin-colour of the face, giving it a greenish hue.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>As said before, the builds are very nice to great. The riksha is simply awesome (though maybe somewhat oversized), and the Piranha Mech can only be described as odd. Odd, but also brilliant in its crazyness. It is a nice mixture of sand-blue and yellow, in keeping with the Shark Army colour scheme. The feet can be turned somewhat, adding to the stability of the mech (which is surprisingly good). he flickfire missiles are nice, but in a somewhat awkward position to launch, IMHO. The Shark Army thug serving as the mech driver fits in easily, and the control-levers are actually easy to put in his hands.&nbsp;The control-panel is a print (the sole print in this set).&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>This is mostly a play set, with - presumably - the mech hunting down the riksha. The mech is easy to handle, although launching the flick-fire missile is a bit tricky. The mech IMHO is actually eyecatching enough to stand alone as a display piece as well.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>IMHO one of the better small sets around in Lego, and one of the best sets in the Lego Ninjago Movie Range. Nice minifigs, perhaps the best mech in the Shark Army, an awesome riksha, what is there more to wish for? Great value for money at regular price, and even more so if found on a discount. Also, this set will make a great gift.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-31T02:11:33.403Z","The Journey of a Thousand Steps, Begins with a Giant Mechanical Piranha.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #70629 Piranha Attack:</b> The LEGO Ninjago Movie introduced some interesting new design aesthetics for the villains and this set looks like a fairly decent offering from the Theme. The sets are actually not to bad overall, though they seem to have sold relatively slowly as certain areas of the world continue to be drowning in certain sets from this Theme. Still this is a really nice little set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: The design is pretty much the same for other LEGO Ninjago Movie sets and it showcases the set and its play features very nicely on the front and back. Love the movie designed packaging and the evolution from TLM to TLBM and TLNM and then going forward to TLM2.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: This type of manual looks really interesting. It&rsquo;s like an actual book that is small and rectangular in design, you open it and read it from left to right and the step-by-step instructions are, as always, easy to follow along with. It&rsquo;s rare though for the paper stock to be printed vertically rather than horizontally when making manuals, this protected it from being bent or creased in the packing process and really makes it easier to flip through the manual once you start building.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set features a unique looking element that, if I am very much not mistaken, is a nosecone element from LEGO planes. Traditionally this element is used when building aeroplanes in LEGO and to find it here in such a unique and interesting colour scheme is a very welcome sight. Large bubble cockpits and donut plates are also included in the set, overall a fairly fun looking selection of parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kai: This Minifigure is pretty much the same as what we&rsquo;ve seen in other sets with Kai, however instead of including the two mask elements he has his unique hair piece. He includes the two swords, sheath and has the exact same print as the version included with the Water Strider.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Misako: This version of the character in his her unique armor from the Flashback scene and the end of the movie. Her torso print is very well tone, with her included cloth skirt element, unique hair piece and quiver and bow pieces make her look very impressive. Unfortunately LEGO has developed some kind of quality issue with the facial prints of LEGO Minifigures printed on the black heads. The yellow is just barely visible and her eyes and lips are a bit washed out and faded because of this issue, it&rsquo;s quite unfortunate as past Minifigures did not have nearly as many problems when printed on black heads.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ray: This citizen of NINJAGO City is dressed fairly similarly to Ham in the NINJAGO City 25$ set I reviewed previously. The overall aesthetic is fairly similar though Ray has lighter colours and different costume detailing for his torso print. He has no accessories, but much like his fellow citizen he has the single-sided facial print with a screaming expression, which makes him just look odd when the Shark Army is not attacking.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Shark Army Thug: This Minifigure is identical to others found in different sets which we have discussed recently, all of his printing and parts use are the same as the generic thug deserves for ease of troop building and having a small army on your shelf and in your toy box. This one however does not include any accessories to hold when he leaves his mech vehicle during the battle.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 1: Kai, Ray and the little rickshaw model are built with this bag. You will find the rickshaw model to be extremely fun to build, it&rsquo;s a really unique build that looks great using a car hood piece in a very interesting way. Stickers are used for most of the detailing in this set, so be careful as you apply them to the parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 2: Misako and the Shark Army Thug are building a large Piranha vehicle, this is really fun to build and I loved making this model come together as I worked on it. The parts use was extremely new to me as I haven&rsquo;t had any LEGO Plane sets in the past, so seeing how versatile this element is really impressed me. The legs were a bit repetitive with this model, but overall it was very fun. Stickers were applied here as well, so be mindful of when to get the sticker sheet out and where the placement is.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Piranha: This model is loaded with personality and just looks great. It is a bit limited in what parts can move, the feet are fairly large and help to keep the model stable when its standing, the top opens with click joints and you can place the pilot inside to drive it, the tooth placement and the extra missiles included give you more to appreciate when you get it built. There aren&rsquo;t a lot of moveable parts compared to larger Mech sets from this Theme, but the model still looks great and uses the parts to make the design work very well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Rickshaw: This additional model was really fun to build and uses some fun parts. It is a bit awkward looking, but once the Minifigure is holding onto the handles he can take off to get a customer or run from the Piranha.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I loved this set, every part of building it was truly satisfying and amusing. Unfortunately I am a bit disappointed that one of the Minifigures suffers a bit from facial printing issues. Overall though I&rsquo;d still recommend this set for fans of the models, characters or overall design of this set. Strongly recommended.</p>
