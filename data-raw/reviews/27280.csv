<p>Building this set was a pleasant surprise. I bought it more as a part of my collection of Ninjago Movie sets, than actually being wowed by it when in the box. However, the wow factor arrived when building the set;&nbsp;perhaps not so&nbsp;much with the first bag (of five), but definitely from bag 3 onwards. About 90 minutes after beginning&nbsp;the build.&nbsp;the final&nbsp;result looks much better than I had expected. This set&nbsp;above all offers a lot of play value. The designer did a great job, IMHO some of the design features being on par with what was done&nbsp;with Ninjago&nbsp;City and Destiny&#39;s Bounty. There are numerous stickers (though limited by Ninjago&nbsp;Movie set standards), most of them&nbsp;easy to apply, though - and this is tricky - of the clear backing type. So be aware of fingerprints.There are a number of references to the movie and other sets included. Also, the set can also be used to provide integrate some of the Ninjago Minifigures Series minifigs into play. Is this set worth it at RRP? IMHO, yes; in fact, looking play-value for money this could well be&nbsp;best set of this second wave of Ninjago&nbsp;Movie sets.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Building experience</h2>

<p>In my experience, the manual often gives a good impression of what building the set will be like. That is definitely not true for this set. The building of this set, IMHO, started out rather bland; but got better with each bag. Already from the first bag one has to install the stickers. There are only 11 of them, 8 of them with the clear backing, and three with a completely black background. All but one of them are easy to apply on flat surfaces (only one massive sticker is on a partially curved surface). That said, mistakes are extremely visible for most stickers: applying them off-center (the three black computer screens on white tiles) or off-center and finger prints (clear with black &#39;rocks&#39;&nbsp;on trans orange pieces).</p>

<p>During various stages of the build the structure is rather flimsy, and pieces break of easily. However, with the addition of a few bricks, the structure suddenly becomes very solid and fairly easy to handle. Only the one column in the back is somewhat easy to break off by the time the structure is finished.</p>

<p>The designer(s) have IMHO done a great job. In my opinion some of the features are on par&nbsp;with the likes of Ninjago&nbsp;City (70620) and Destiny&#39;s Bounty (70618). The design of Garmadon&#39;s residence (with aquarium) is but one example. Likewise the design of the maul of the passage to the world outside. Probably&nbsp;there are some special pieces, like the sand blue oyster shells, the trans orange pieces used to depict the lava, and the sand coloured&nbsp;decorative pieces used for the display stands in Garmadon&#39;s&nbsp;room. I think the designer has done a nice job of creating a susbtantial set (in size) using some big pieces (wall panels, scaffolds, 1x2x5&nbsp;columns and such)&nbsp;without giving you the feeling that this set is a number of big pieces slapped together.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>The minifigures, are IMHO surprisingly good. Zane and Garmadon are nothing special and found on other sets, but General #1, Four Eyes and Steve are very good and unique to this set.</p>

<p>Zane is found in four other sets:&nbsp;Spinjitzu training (70606), Fire mech (70615), Ice tank (70616) and Destiny&#39;s Bounty (70618).</p>

<p>Garmadon is found in two other sets: Garma Mecha Man (70613) and garmadon, Garmadon, GARMADON (70656). His print is nice, only one face print, and he is armed with a nice staff.</p>

<p>General #1 is has a very nice print on the torso, especially the front (nicely decked out with medals), which is continued on the legs. His Great White Shark headgear is hard plastic. What is particularly nice is that this is the unlaunched version, while the post-launch version (with corresponding burn damage) is available as a separate minigure in the Ninjago Movie collectible minifigures set&nbsp;(Shark Army Great White ). He has a single face print.</p>

<p>Four Eyes has a soft rubber/plastic mould for his head gear, which has a good print for the eyes. His torso is printed nicely on both sides, and his legs are printed on the front. However, I think the torso and legs themselves are found on other Shark Army minifigures&nbsp;- at least they look very similar. His face print is nice (expressive eyebrows, scruffy beard; there is no secondary face. When wearing his headcover&nbsp;you only see his eyes and above all his eyebrows.</p>

<p>Steve is IMHO the best minifigure of the lot. He is the only one with two face prints, consisting of massive glasses and his mouth. All of this is barely visible through his massive hair-piece, with moustache and beard. In some ways he resembles cousing IT from the Adam&#39;s Family. His torso print is very good and colourful. There is a small print on the back, but lots of it, with lots of colour on the front. This is front print is nicely continued on the legs (perfectly lined up and in register!). His legs are actually dual moulded (white and sand blue).</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Garmadon&#39;s&nbsp;volvano lair forms the corner of a square or rectangle, and is meant to be looked at from the inside out. It is clear that the designer has focused on the inside looks. Central is the mini-volcano, with at the bottom the exit, in the middle one of Garmadon&#39;s&nbsp;private rooms, and at the top the launchpad for Garmadon&#39;s underlings who have failed. On either side you have a platform where Garmadon&#39;s scientists come up with weapons to aid him in his attemts to conquer Ninjago&nbsp;City.</p>

<p>Garmadon&#39;s&nbsp;room is well done, with the aquarium and the tea table as stand out features.</p>

<p>The left &#39;lab&#39; at the bottom has a landing pad for the flying oyster security drone (a brilliant little build in itself), with a design/control&nbsp;station on top. The miniature Piranha walker and coffee maker are very nice (and very well done).&nbsp;&nbsp;The right &#39;lab&#39; is apparently where some of the weapons are assembled, an has a crane to lift the great shark out of the water. The bottom has a movable (&#39;exploding&#39;)&nbsp;wall.</p>

<p>I fully agree with the assessment that I have comr across before (maybe from Jangbricks) that the designer has done an excellent job designing the set to the given price point. Within the limitations of this set, I think it is as good as it gets - with IMHO some of the features clearly reminiscent of Ninjago&nbsp;City in quality of design. Most notable are&nbsp;the mouth of the exit,&nbsp;the aquarium and the lava flow. And just like with Ninjago&nbsp;City, there are many references to the movie, other sets and inside jokes. A major positive for me is that the play-features are not highlighted by bright red or yellow elements, yet still stand out.</p>

<p>In fact, IMHO this set offers a great basis for those who wish to build an expanded/enlarged&nbsp;Garmadon&#39;s&nbsp;lair.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This IMHO is definitely a play set. There are a number of clear play features, and the platforms are designed in such a way to allow many minifigures to interact with each other. Most notable is the &#39;failed general&#39; launcher on top, which works very well - a little better than the &#39;exploding wall&#39;, it seems.&nbsp;The drone can easily be flown around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is less of a display set. It lacks size, and clearly has only one side meant for display.&nbsp;The colour scheme is such that it easily disappears on a shelf. As mentioned above, I think it can be used as a basis for expansion into a much larger rendition of Garmadon&#39;s&nbsp;base. One of the first things to consider is putting in something of a base plate.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, this set was a pleasant surprise to me, and IMHO much better than I initially thought when I got it. A nice number of play features, not too big, but for its size quite spacious. I think the designer has done an excellent job balancing between price point, size, play features and looks. It has a lot of value for money, and IMHO it is a candidate of being the best set of this second wave of Ninjago Movie sets. Although not as eye-catching as for instance the Quake Mech or the Piranha attack, it is IMHO a set&nbsp;worth getting.</p>

"EnergyBlast_Productions","2018-12-28T18:58:08.443Z","YOU'RE FIRED!!!- oh, wait, that doesn't really work...","<p>The Lego Ninjago&nbsp;Movie sets are quite possibly some of the best LEGO sets ever made. &nbsp;From small sets like Ninjago City Chase to bigger ones like the 2017 Destiny&#39;s Bounty, this different rendition of the Ninjago&nbsp;franchise has never ceased to amaze me. &nbsp;Garmadon&#39;s&nbsp;Volcano Lair is no exception.</p>

<p>This set features a fairly eye-appealing volcano structure with different rooms built into it. &nbsp;The minifigure&nbsp;selection is good, with all but two of the minifigures being exclusive. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Zane is the ninja included here, and while he&#39;s not anything particularly special, he&#39;s a good addition since he really doesn&#39;t come in many cheaper sets other than Spinjitzu Training. &nbsp;His weapon is his bow.</p>

<p>Garmadon&nbsp;is the other non-exclusive figure in this set, and he also comes in many larger sets. &nbsp;He also comes in another $50 set from this theme, the Green Ninja Mech Dragon, but it&#39;s still nice to get him here. &nbsp;His weapon is a tall staff with a piece at the top that doesn&#39;t really come in many sets other than the CMF series.</p>

<p>General #1 (not to be confused with the female general from the CMF series) is a really great minifigure. &nbsp;His torso is my favorite part of him, with the navy blue coat sported with a ridiculous amount of gold medals. &nbsp;His shark headpiece is nice. &nbsp;He has no accessory.</p>

<p>Four Eyes is another hilarious aquatic headpiece figure, and he sports a nice recolor of the octopus headpiece in sand green. &nbsp;He has no accessory.</p>

<p>Steve is probably my favorite minifigure in the set. &nbsp;He wears a white lab coat over his tiedie shirt and his beard hairpiece is really nice. &nbsp;He has two different faceprints but they&#39;re not very different at first glance with the beard on. &nbsp;He has no accessory.</p>

<p>The volcano has a nice design with the large mouth of the cave reminding me of the Temple of Resurrection set. &nbsp;Speaking of which, this set is very similar in height with that particular temple, which is very good considering that this set is $20 cheaper. &nbsp;The set uses translucent orange pieces to resemble a flow of lava running down the side of the volcano, with a few stickers added for detail. &nbsp;There are two main rooms built into the volcano on either side, one being a science lab and a small garage for a mechanical clam drone. &nbsp;The lab has a neat computer build and coffee machine, as well as a miniscaled version of one of the Shark Army vehicles, probably a prototype.</p>

<p>The other side has a platform with a wall that can be broken down by a lever, as well as a long yellow crane that can be used to pick things up. &nbsp;A small shark is also included in the set, and you can use the crane to pick it up.</p>

<p>The main room is Garmadon&#39;s&nbsp;small hangout, where there&#39;s a really awesome aquarium integrated into the wall. &nbsp;It looks really good, and is probably my favorite part of the set. &nbsp;There&#39;s several weapons held on the left wall, while a table on the right holds what I believe is fish food for the fish in the tank. &nbsp;There&#39;s a large table that sits in the middle of the room and it holds a cup and teapot for Garmadon to enjoy his tea from. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Moving higher, you reach the top of the volcano, where the long flow of lava starts. &nbsp;There&#39;s a feature where you can sit General #1 (or any figure, really) and literally fire them out of the volcano. &nbsp;Except...it really doesn&#39;t work. &nbsp;You&#39;re supposed to sit the minifigure down on a round red tile and then quickly flip a lever to &quot;launch&quot; them out of the volcano. &nbsp;But, like I said, it really doesn&#39;t work. &nbsp;You have to work hard at it just to get the figure to fall out of the volcano top, let alone get it in the air. &nbsp;It really sucks since the rest of the set is almost perfect.</p>

<p>Overall, Garmadon&#39;s&nbsp;Volcano Lair is a solid build with a great size for the amount of pieces, a good set of minifigures, and honestly is a good display model. &nbsp;However, Garmadon may need to find a new way to fire his generals...</p>
