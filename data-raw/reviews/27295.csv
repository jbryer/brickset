<p>I recently got this set via Brinklink : I had to ordered it from Germany, so I hope you&#39;ll have an easier way than me if you wish to get this Jungle (mini) set.</p>

<p>It was my fisrt opportunity to get a small tent (which I already had in mind since the Artic serie) and this set was the one to do so. I just wondered what I can imagine in the future to reuse the plastic part of the tent, the future will tell ; a solar surface of space ship maybe ?</p>

<p>The building is very simple and kids with their small hands will have an easier acces inside the tent than I (my children have demonstrated it). I enjoy the green snake, which give the opportunity to frighten the poor explorer when he&#39;ll go to rest under the tent of course !</p>

<p>The statue is small but effective, especially with the circle arch on the top, nice to hind in a bigger jungle of my diorama.</p>

<p>Last but not lust, the polybag includ a small poster which represent a jungle area, which could be useful to anyone who d&#39;like to build a small diorama on a shelve for instance (Of course, I&#39;ll have prefer if Lego had put the price of this poster into real bricks ;-).</p>

<p>I hope the small review will be usefull to the Lego community and best regards</p>
