<p><b>Minifigure&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>The figure includes is Jay Walker in his spinjitzu&nbsp;training outfit, his face is double sided one showing happiness with freckles and the other showing a either concentrated far or angered face with freckles and his hair is the new for 2017 jay hair, his torso and pants have some dojo printing. None of the pieces for Jay are exclusive. He is holding two accessories a throwing star and some nunchucks.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>In this set there are two builds a phone holder and a setting.</p>

<p>The setting build has three builds attached to a large piece of double sided card showing either the busy Ninjago&nbsp;city or a quite highway through the city, two of the three stands are identical using 8 pieces 10 pieces in total and are decorated with golden grid tiles and have 2x2 jumper plates for a figure to stand on while the third is the same but doesn&rsquo;t&nbsp;have the grid decor and uses 8 pieces, all three are attached to the card by a technic pin and a small technic stopper.</p>

<p>The phone holder is a simple build that uses 9 elements and has some decor but very little and the phone is held in by a rubber technic part, the build is on a 8x6 black plate.</p>

<p><strong>Other</strong></p>

<p>One&nbsp;last element is a clear light pole part that is used to hold the figure but can&rsquo;t be seen&nbsp;in ur little LEGO&nbsp;movie.</p>

<p>Also there is a sheet of card the holds 6 printed effects that can pop out the card those are a lightening strike, 2 types of explosions, 2 types of fire and a water effect.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To conclude this review i recommend this for a small pocket money toy if your at an Argos but seen as it&rsquo;s price&nbsp;is dropping but Argos stores are not&nbsp;selling out this isn&rsquo;t a great seller. The overall builds are not&nbsp;to exciting and the figure isn&rsquo;t exclusive so it&rsquo;s a shame but it has a great playability to me though.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-</strong>&nbsp;Cheap to buy in the UK, strong playability</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>Exclusivity, Parts and large use of card</p>
