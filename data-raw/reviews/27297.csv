I&#39;ll pick up&nbsp;just about any set with a seasonal theme, and usually they&#39;re great little additions to my collection of brick-based ornaments. Unfortunately I can&#39;t say the same for <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/5004934-1/Christmas-Ornament"">5004934: Christmas Ornament</a>, which is one of the most disappointing sets I&#39;ve spent money on in quite some time.</p>

<p>My first issue with this set&nbsp;is the value proposition. I paid USD$6.99 at my local Target for this, and the set&nbsp;includes only sixty-six pieces. While that&#39;s more-or-less in line with the commonly accepted &quot;ten-cents-per-piece&quot; pricing for non-licensed sets, at this&nbsp;price point I still believe more pieces should have been included. The discrepancy becomes very apparent&nbsp;if you compare&nbsp;Christmas Ornament with this year&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/30478-1/Santa-Claus"">30478: Santa Claus</a>&nbsp;polybag, which&nbsp;includes eight more pieces than 5004934 at half the retail price. Perhaps one could argue the more substantial packaging on Christmas Ornament accounts for the difference, but is a small cardboard&nbsp;box really worth $3.49?</p>

<p>This brings me to my second complaint: the packaging is weirdly deceptive for an official LEGO product. Typically The Lego Group is very careful about accurately representing exactly what elements you&#39;re getting inside a set with its packaging, but here they&#39;ve depicted a substantial brick-built Christmas tree on one side of the box that can&#39;t actually be constructed with the pieces included. Instead the box itself is intended to serve as part of the ornament, with a tiny brick windmill attached to the very top as a star-like accent. Two child minifigures and their presents make up the&nbsp;remaining elements of this set; the adult female figure pictured on another side of the box is also absent. I&#39;m quite disappointed that TLG thought this was acceptable packaging design, as uninformed consumers could easily assume the set contains more pieces than it actually does without carefully studying the box.</p>

<p>Helping to slightly offset the poor value are the two aforementioned minifigures (albeit with child-size legs) and a couple of rare&nbsp;elements, such as the&nbsp;boy&#39;s Santa hat&nbsp;and a golden conical piece used in the base of the windmill. I suppose this set could be used to supplement an existing holiday scene, but there are certainly far more cost-efficient methods for doing so. If you&#39;re looking for Christmas accessories in the same general price range, my&nbsp;advice is to pick up any of&nbsp;the better seasonal sets available, such as <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40262-1/Christmas-Train-Ride"">40262: Christmas Train Ride</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40263-1/Christmas-Town-Square"">40263: Christmas Town Square</a>&nbsp;or <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40253-1/Christmas-Build-Up"">40253: Christmas Build-Up</a>.</p>

<p>Avoid this overpriced impulse set, and save your money for something else!</p>

"josekalel","2017-11-17T17:21:32.277Z","Misleading and Deceptive Packaging: Avoid if Possible","<p>As many of us do, I look forward for the seasonal-themed sets every couple of months. When I visited Target a few days ago I saw this set (#<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/5004934-1/Christmas-Ornament"">5004934</a>) and thought that it was a bit pricey ($6.99)&nbsp;but I also though that it might be a good buy since it <em>looked </em>like it had a brick tree inside (I also ignored to read the reviews in Target&#39;s website, big mistake), so I got four; two for myself, and two as gifts.</p>

<p>As soon as I got home I opened the nice package (the packaging does look cool, and at first I thought the actual whole box was the ornament) and saw the instructions (and the lack of green bricks for a tree), I realized that I had been misled into thinking I would get a brick tree. This is not the case.</p>

<p>This set includes two children minifigures with very generic torsos and faces, and the builds of a gift box, a tricycle, and a remote controlled car. Oh, and no tree.</p>

<p>Overall, is it worth it? No, only for completists like some of us are. You are better off buying <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/40263-1/Christmas-Town-Square"">40263 Christmas Town Square</a> instead.&nbsp;</p>

"CarolinaOnMyMind","2018-01-18T20:35:31.643Z","Really not much to it.","<p>If you read the other reviews for this set, you&#39;ve probably already got a good sense of what to expect. I&#39;m in agreement for the most part. It is not one of the better sets LEGO has put out and the box can indeed be rather deceiving. However, in my case, I knew exactly what I was getting. It is a super small set with minimum building and the box itself is used to form the &quot;tree&quot; structure. It really boils down to two kid minifigs, a tricycle, a toy car, a present and a weird tree-top, which immediately went to spare parts.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t really speak to the value of the set because I received it as a free gift at TRU when making other purchases, but just looking at the USD $6.99 others seem&nbsp;to have paid for it, yeah, totally not worth that. Honestly, probably not worth purchasing at all in my opinion, even for $2 or $3. But, since I received it as a thrown-in gift, I won&#39;t complain.</p>

<p>AND I did discover something VERY GOOD&nbsp;about this set. I recently purchased the reissue of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10249-1/Winter-Toy-Shop"">10249 Winter Village Toy Shop</a> for my wife to construct this holiday season (which she thoroughly enjoyed). However, while building it, my 4-year-old daughter also wanted to participate and since that build was a little much for her, I initially gave her&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40263-1/Christmas-Town-Square"">40263 Christmas Town Square</a>&nbsp;to work on while her mommy was working on the bigger set. But although she is pretty good with most LEGO, my daughter was having some trouble doing the Town Square by herself and soon got discouraged. This is where this Christmas Ornament set came in super handy. I gave her that instead and since it is so small and simplistic, it was perfect to occupy and entertain my 4-year-old during that time. She mostly likes figures anyway and&nbsp;didn&#39;t care that the tree was not actually a tree. She got to build Christmas LEGO together with her mommy and was happy. I must say, it was perfect for that purpose. And we eventually just threw these minifigs and extra presents into our Winter Village display, which works quite nicely.</p>

<p>But overall... yeah, not a great set. Skip it if you ever see it again, which I&#39;m not sure you will.</p>
