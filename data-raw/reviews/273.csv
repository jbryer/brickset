The Igor fig is also great and it has a medievil hat that was a long time not seen in lego sets. The actorfellow is nice but not very special. The tile with the onionthings  (I don't know the english name for Knoflook) on it is great. The background with the coffin is very nice but the paper thing in the background was not necessairy.

"Smallsam99","2008-05-31T17:56:31.577Z","the only lego vampire","THis set here is a very unique set and sets itself apart from many others. For one it has some unique pieces and has the only released lego vampire. The set has a great playibility that can be put in and a decent amount of figures. It also was a very cheap set to buy. I found this set at a K.B. toys in '03 I think. It wasd only 11 dollars so I bought it. Now lets review it.
pros: 
-rare pieces and colors.

-onions piece (very rare)

-only lego vampire ever!

-coffin

-interchanging faces

COns:none

Overall a pretty solid set and shows off lego's creative side. It also has a sound cd in it for lego studios movie maker. I rate it about a 8.5/10 and say to get it for about 25 dollars or less.

"legoman4694","2008-06-16T22:10:48.7Z","funny!","i love it! count dracula has a cool cape and his face turns around so he looks like he wants blood. theres a coffin too. its cool how the only thing that makes it studios is the guy with the light. no hidden camera no director nothing. just him. also the guys head turns around so he looks scared. so much for a fearless hero! there is some hobo and the piece with the sheld and stuff is cardboard. there is also garlic and a gem. theres too many good things to list so just get it. you wont be sorry!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Bricktoothyo","2008-06-16T23:51:40.7Z","DRACULA HAS RISEN FROM THE GRAVE!","This one got me buying Lego again,bigtime.
A Vampire minifig has got to be the coolest thing since the ghost,and the hunchback guy is an absolute classic-you can use his face to make a good (as in bad)witch
The hero is pretty cool,Ive found his outfit very useful too.
As shown on the box,this set has a great adaptability to it,you can rearrange it in a lot of different ways giving it a lot of playability as far as Im concerned,I really like the carriage pictured on it.
Even the comic in the instructions is a real hoot!
With the tree and bowl with WOLF on it(on the other side of the cardboard slip) it ties in really nicely to the Werewolf ambush set and Ive combined them along with a few other things to make a scary castle/haunted forest.

I just recently found all the Scary Studios sets (very exciting because I am a huge fan of the Universal Studios Monster Movies of the 1930s and 1940s) so to combine my two favourite things, Lego and Monster movies, is quite simply wonderful. Vampire's Crypt was the first one to have arrived. So I promtly made it up and couldn't stop grinning the whole time. I love that vampire. He has the most awesome cloak, his hair is gorgeous and he has a double sided face. The second face has blood around his mouth, fiendishly sick. I love it!

The set itself is also really cool, there is a neat little backdrop of the dungeon wall which is also double sided. The back is the view from the outside, and has a window and a dog bowl on the groung.  It is a nice size, compact and in three sections so you can move it and arrange it however you wish.  It has a neat construction design, the Vampire's coffin can slide across the top of the set towards the platform, the platform is lowered down level to the cart, turn the knob and the coffin slides effortlessly onto the cart.

I give this set an easy 5 bricks, and the Vampire fig gets a 6 brick rating.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The use of rubber bands i thought was a bit badly shown in the instructions, and it's an aspect of the set i didn't really ever make use of.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-23T11:00:15.44Z","LEGO Studios - Vampire's Crypt Review","I love this set. It's also the first set which has a vampire minifig. This vampire looks much better than the one from the collectable minifigures series 2. I like his cape and the face of that minifig. He has a black suit and black hair. This is a nice scary looking vampire. The other minifigs are a gent who looks a little bit likes James Bond, an old man with a brown hood and an assistant. <br><br>The set itself is awsome. We get a nice double-printed background for this scene and two towers. The first tower has a stairway which leads you to the top of that building. On the top you can put the brown sarcophagus where you can put the vampire in. On the bottom of this tower is a gem and a piece which has some garlic on it. I think it's the only way to get ths piece. The other tower just has a lift which you can use to put the sarcophagus to the other tower. It's a fun build and we also don't get any stickers to worry about.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"LegoMunchy88","2011-06-20T17:45:50.3Z","The Best Studios Set","<p>Lego Vampire Crypt is the best set of the Studios theme in my opinion, but that really isn't saying much. Although, this really is a great set. With decent parts and great minifigures, this is overall very nice. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Minifigs</strong></p>
<p>Vampire: Obviously the best minifigure of the set, with a nice reversable head, and that coffin is awesome. </p>
<p>Gent: Gent is the official Lego name for the guy in the tan. He's a nice unsuspecting victim, though I'm not sure why he's always the victim, as in Mummy's Tomb, Werewolf Ambush, and Scary Laboratory.</p>
<p>Vampire's Servant: I find it amusing to refer to this guy as ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" or ""Quasimoto"". A nice figure, nothing really special though. </p>
<p>Director/Filmer: The figure is alright, but he adds a whole new playability to the set. Now, the ""film"" can be cut, started over, and premiered in sets like the Town Plan's movie theater.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>
<p>The set is really three main section with a cart as well. I'll talk about the cart first: it's a cart. There's really nothing else to say. It's a cart that can carry Dracula and his coffin around, but that's it. Next I'll talk about the first section. The first section includes a skeleton head in a glass case, which is very difficult to attach again after taking it off, and some garlic. The reason for the garlic is obviously because Vampires are apparently scared off by garlic for some reason. Hidden behind the garlic is a jewel, which I like to stick in the coffin. The second section is just a piece of carboard with two inverted pictures on it. The first is the inside, with a shelf with books and some candles. The outside shows a window and a dog bowl. I'm not sure if this was put as a cardboard piece because it's supposed to be like a theater, or just because. Personally, I would have much better liked it built. The final section holds the Vampire's Coffin. With the use of some technic bricks, the coffin falls off the stand and raises up. It's a nice addition to the set, and the coffin is a great piece. The only thing is that I would have loved for those gold things to be part of the actualy piece instead of stickers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p>Overall, Lego Vampire Crypt is a nice set, for the right price. With a nice playability factor and some fairly nice parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
