Normally most reviews on Brickset are written by the actual person using a set, however a proper review of this product requires the right audience to use this product - enter my one-year old niece.

After watching my niece play with the Quatro bricks, I can see all of the intelligent design logic that LEGO used to make this product a real winner.

Before the lid was even off the bucket, the bright colours of the bricks drew my niece's attention to the set immediately (and made my babysitting job much easier!). The transparent bucket makes it easy for toddlers to recognise what this product contains.

The lid also doubles as a baseplate - a very intelligent feature, and the lip on the bucket is large enough so that a small child cannot get their small fingers wedged between the lip.

Quatro bricks are nice and large, and are just the right size for those little ones who are still developing their fine motor skills. The large size of the bricks is also useful for cleaning and drying the bricks (as most people know, toddlers aren't always the cleanest!).

It's a shame that LEGO has stopped producing the Quatro range of bricks and sets - the Quatro bricks are a real winner with my one-year old niece, and her mother now wants a set to take home with her!

Positives:
* Nice large bricks - great for little hands!
* Bright, eye-catching colours. 
* Easy-to-clean - kids aren't always clean!
* Innovative double-use of the lid as a baseplate
* Quatro bricks can be used with Duplo bricks 

Negatives:
* No longer produced by the LEGO Group - a real shame considering the quality of this product.

In summary, an excellent, well-thought out product that is a winner with toddlers. A search on eBay is probably the only way to get copies of this set, albeit,  second-hand.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
