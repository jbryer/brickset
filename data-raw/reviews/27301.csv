"HikerCZ","2017-10-18T20:57:42.54Z","The VIP treatment","<p>As a regular VIP customer I felt obliged to get the latest freebie. Even though getting it is not that easy this time around, you have to spend a substantial amount of money to get it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First surprise - it comes in a polyethylene bag not a box (probably to keep the production cost lower). Second surprise - it&#39;s quite heavy and when you pile the bricks, it feels like a regular small to medium retail set.</p>

<p>The build starts promisingly and it&#39;s fairly simple. You have to be extra careful to align all those 1x1s&nbsp;but it&#39;s doable. A brick separator (not included) will do the trick. One possible drawback (for me) are the stickers. I am one of those strange fellows who adamantly refuses to apply stickers no matter how important they seem. And in a set where stickers represent Lego boxes in a shop that&#39;s a real bummer. Without the stickers you just have a bunch of colourful tiles on a wall and it looks quite dull to be honest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another drawback becomes obvious when you finish the VIP &#39;wall&#39; and connect it to the shop structure. They look disjointed. I&#39;ve&nbsp;raised the shop section by one brick to make it the same height as the VIP wall and it looks much better. That said you can always keep the two sections separate. The VIP wall is luckily able to stand&nbsp;by itself&nbsp;without any additional supports.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two figures are included, one monochromatic red for the VIP&nbsp;part&nbsp;and a shop assistant with an exclusive (?) torso,&nbsp;which is probably the best feature of this set. &nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all it&#39;s a nice little thing (especially the shop) with lovely references all regular brick and mortar customers recognise. For those who aren&#39;t that lucky to have a genuine Lego store in their country (mine included), it&#39;s a chance to own something rather unique and special. And of course it&#39;s for free, which is never wrong. After building it and looking at it, I wouldn&#39;t probably spend my money on this set, however, as a freebie it&#39;s perfectly recommendable.&nbsp;</p>

Only VIP members were given this set, if you were not a VIP member you could not receive it. Unfortunate for folks which wanted it, however it makes sense, from a business standpoint. It was also limited to one-per-household as far as I recall, they only offered it once and if you ordered another order later on that month it would omit the free item&hellip; I could be wrong on that, but from my personal experience it was only one per customer.</span></span></span></span></p>

However I feel it important to mention this, and I opened it as soon as I got it, so&hellip; the longer it stays in the package the worse it may develop.</span></span></span></span></p>

The LEGO store build incorporates a lot of fine detail work as you build a very nice looking final end product which features a load of detailing. There is a modular element involved with some Technic pins to connect the two models once finished, the build itself was extremely satisfying though, despite the small nature of the model.</span></span></span></span></p>

Do not try and use this at the store though, it, uh, won&rsquo;t work. LOL The modular pin connectors help out a lot, if you wanted you could MOC up a much larger store and connect them together with the pins while keeping the VIP card perhaps as a back wall for the store, since it can be connected to for both of you.</span></span></span></span></p>

It depends on a few key factors, if you would like to have this particular set, or the LEGO VIP card it might be easier to bricklink most of the parts. However, keep in mind that if you want this actual set the packaging may be causing a premature yellowing effect on the white elements. With all of this in mind I would recommend it if you absolutely have to have it and missed out during the giveaway time. However you can safely skip it if you aren&rsquo;t interested in this type of set.</span></span></span></span></p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-08-15T05:10:01.077Z","Absolute bargain for your VIP points ","<p>So the new VIP program allows you to get this for 500 points. Considering that it takes 650 points to get $5 off, that mean this set effectively costs less than $4. However, you still need to pay for shipping if you don&rsquo;t reach the minimum $35 for free shipping, and after redeeming your points, you only have 30 days to order this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The brick count for the set is a little misleading. Yes, it does have all the pieces it says, but this is a small highly detailed set so that means tons of small bricks. The pick a brick wall alone is composed of 12 studs and another 12 1x1 round tiles, and these are far from the only 1x1 bricks used in this set. On the bright side, with all these small pieces you get somewhere in the ballpark of 20 extra bricks. As for the rest of the bricks, there is nothing too exciting, but you really can&rsquo;t expect much from a set like this. The only major problem with the parts is like others said, the white bricks are slightly yellowed, with slightly being the key word here. I don&rsquo;t understand this since my Classic Space sets from my childhood have no yellowing at all. However, since the slight yellowing varies, the VIP card doesn&rsquo;t look like the single solid color that it should be. The store however looks fine as there are plenty of colored details to break up its&nbsp;monotonous walls.</p>

<p>The set has two separate components that may be combined together. A small Lego store, and a VIP card. Both of which feature technic holes on either side allowing you to connect them however you please, or not at all. However I do think the suggested way of connecting them looks best.</p>

<p>The Lego store is small but surprisingly accurate. It only has 2 walls, which allows you easy access to the interior, but includes every major feature. On one wall you see the various Lego sets for sale, all of which are created by stickers. The other is the pick a brick wall which looks fantastic. In front of the pick a brick wall is the cash register and in front of that is a little box resembling where they sell accessories and where they have loose bricks to play with. On the wall of sets there is strangely a mug which seems very out of place, especially since it is another mug that is accurately used to represent accessories in the middle of the store. Then there is the dragon which slithers it&rsquo;s way along both sides of the wall. While it is very simple, it is also highly recognizable as a Chinese style dragon and does a great job representing the life sized Lego builds found in Lego stores. The store features a mostly tiled floor, but with a few studs to hold minifigures. The minifigure&nbsp;who represents an employee looks rather generic except for the large Lego logo on the back of his shirt which makes him a pretty cool minifigure&nbsp;to have. He carries a Lego case, which seems a little strange, I think a minifigure statue would have been more fun and more appropriate, but not a big deal.</p>

<p>The VIP card isn&rsquo;t nearly as exciting, it&rsquo;s an even simpler build and of course is relatively flat. It does look nice however, and the solid red minifigure representing the I is a nice touch. Thanks to the minifigure, I kind of feel like this can represent a wall on the exterior of a Lego store. It is for this reason that I find it appropriate to attach the two builds. But clearly this is a secondary build and not the reason why you should be getting this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this isn&rsquo;t a set that you need to have, but it is very cute. If you have kids who enjoy going to Lego stores, then it is a very nice representation of a place that you no doubt spend a lot of time in in the real world. Sure, you could easily design a larger Lego store with spare bricks, but I&rsquo;m not sure that is really necessary, this set is more than sufficient in representing all of the features of a store.&nbsp;It is the stickers that make this set, so if you are opposed to stickers you may not want it. However, given how few points it costs, if you will be ordering from Lego online, then getting this set is a no brainer!</p>
