It&#39;s pretty self-explanatory: a small pack of CITY accessories. I do think it fills a valuable niche though - a nice assortment of little accessories and mini-builds that can be easily incorporated here and there throughout your City layout. Here&#39;s what you get:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A traffic control booth with a little gate that goes up and down. There is a small window to the side, and room for a traffic controller minifig (not included) to stand inside.</li>
	<li>A street light with a bus stop sign, and a small green trash bin and clear bottle.</li>
	<li>A 2 x 8 planting build, with some red flowers and a &quot;tree&quot;/tall plant. I like the use of the light gray wheel to stand for a city plant protector/pot - you often see metal rings like this around the trunks of sidewalk trees in big cities.</li>
	<li>A small fountain with a cute green frog, and a pneumatic drill.</li>
	<li>A nice traffic light with speed limit sign, and a yellow stand which can hold a push broom and shovel.</li>
	<li>A small construction ahead traffic sign.</li>
	<li>A very simple bench with newspaper, water bottle, and coffee mug.</li>
	<li>A small brick-build crate of produce (green apple, banana, and adorable carrot).</li>
	<li>Finally my favorite: a bicycle stand attached to a city map, and a bicycle in medium azure.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everything is quite small, with really simple builds. None of the parts are particularly rare (although the bike, the frog, and the apple are not super common in these colors). Other than the newspaper, everything printed is a sticker. Still, for the price, a fun set of little details to spice up your City! I&#39;m a big fan of these little accessory packs - hope that LEGO starts putting out more of them. I&#39;d really like to see one focusing on plants/park elements, to add some more texture to my City&#39;s parks.</p>

"TioBella","2017-12-05T22:21:32.733Z","Welcome addition","<p>It is nice to be able to fill out your Lego City with &quot;signs&quot; of life and bits of detailed civic structure. &nbsp;At ten cents a piece there is good value&nbsp;in this unnamed&nbsp;set. &nbsp;Between the bike, the bottle,&nbsp;the frog, the produce,&nbsp;the longer pieces and the printed&nbsp;newspaper, I think you get a nice variety of specialty parts. &nbsp;Yes there are stickers but they are all generic and almost essential to the signage. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I bumped this up to an overall 4 stars because I like the concept I hope to see more Lego City sets that feature small builds depicting the tangible indications of human and animal life.</p>

"jzisko","2020-06-11T13:09:45.45Z","Little Set That Can Be Built In Stages","<p>I got this set for my son some time ago in for a couple reasons. It is a pretty cheap set, can make a good stocking stuffer or &quot;small&quot; gift for birthday or whatever gift-giving occasion strikes you, or, for me personally, bribery.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set has many different City aspects to it that will most likely, upon completion, will be strewn across a bigger build. &nbsp;It has little aspects for roads, parks, and construction. Use it how you see fit, but I have my sub parts all over: added the fountain to Assembly Square (10255), put the guard shack on some road for something, and what can&#39;t you do with another stop light?</p>

<p>The main reason I&nbsp;bought this was to use for rewarding my son for good behavior. &nbsp;For the parent readers of this I divided each little component into a ziploc bag and gave that instead of candy or other&nbsp;incentives when appropriate. &nbsp;For those who are non-parent readers, your decision to buy this will probably hinge on how at accessorize your city (thus the set&#39;s name).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Would I purchase this set aside from the evil plan above? Probably not. &nbsp;It is&nbsp;comprised of mostly common pieces that you could probably recreate easily by starting at the box&nbsp;enough. Is it fun to&nbsp;have in order to&nbsp;bring some detail to my city? Sure. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, not a set to seek out.&nbsp;If obtained, though, can add some good little details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not Recommended if looking for a great Lego experience. I do recommend for small gifts,&nbsp;to complement a city set, or even parental strategy. &nbsp;</p>
