"FowlerBricks","2018-02-27T17:27:29.24Z","Lex Luthor Mech Takedown Unboxing Review","<p>Normal review format can get boring after awhile, don&#39;t you think? I think so, which is why I&#39;m going to do a little experiment. Today I have the Lex Luthor Mech Takedown before me, new and sealed so we&#39;re going to do a sort of unboxing review. I&#39;m itching to build this thing, so let&#39;s dive in!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/n4yd2nv37/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><br />
As I mentioned before, this set is sealed, so let&#39;s go ahead and look at the box. The front is certainly eye catching. Looks like the Justice League, &nbsp;or part of the Justice League, is facing off with Lex Luthor outside the Lexcorp tower. The Daily Planet gleams a block or so down the street. Lex hasn&#39;t caused too much chaos yet, it seems. The road is gonna have to be paved again though. I like the color scheme and comic style background of the top left and bottom right corners of the box. The Justice League has a new group shot with their new outfits and Crypto.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/c6n3kjjdf/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Moving over to the bottom left corner, we see...What is this? New Characters?? A new hero and a new villain? Well, this got exciting quick! Firestorm and Cheetah now join the DC Comics minifigure&nbsp;lineup! We&#39;ll give them a closer look later once we crack the box open.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/4rxrrukjn/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>It also looks like we get a new Batman, a new Wonder Woman and a new Lex! Let&#39;s see what &nbsp;awaits in top of the box. More character shots and an a close-up of the new Rebirth suit Batman! I really like the comic style explosion he&#39;s standing in. Don&#39;t ask how he&#39;s standing in an explosion because you already know the answer: &quot;Because I&#39;m Batman!&quot;.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/y4jke4gbn/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Anyway, turning the box around, we find another action shot, some interesting features of the set: apparently I could attach the prison from the 76096: Superman and Crypto Team-Up to Lex&#39;s Mech if I got it. And the Mech&#39;s cockpit can fly. Like an escape pod. That&#39;s cool and useful if Lex is losing the fight.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ojzxr4go3/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>As on the front of the box, all the exciting stuff is in the bottom left corner. Look at all those new pieces!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/b32z8hj9v/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>On the side is a neat bit of artwork with Batman and Wonder Woman.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/u868i3sr7/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Alright, enough talk about the box. I gotta open this thing! Got my knife ready...here we go!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/635j0qvpf/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Look at all the fun that awaits us here!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/sf3btmf8j/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>That&#39;s quite a few stickers, but man do they look good!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/i3qz1g88z/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The instructions are much the same as the box.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/re334j0tv/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>There&#39;s some cool stuff in the back. Who wouldn&#39;t want a full page picture of Batman next to an iPhone?</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ezgb47wgz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/kz427tjtf/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;The instructions are telling me to build Lex and Batman, so let&#39;s take a look at them.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/vyp9joi0z/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Batman is all decked out in his new Rebirth outfit. It looks a bit simple but I love it! It might be my #1 favorite Batman so far and that&#39;s really saying something since &nbsp;I have like 18 Batman minifigures (all different and I&#39;m not exaggerating).</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/v96h764kz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The gold belt looks amazing and I like the classic, almost 60s looking Batsymbol. He&#39;s got a type 3 cowl, which is the newest kind, and the new face with stubble.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/4bck5cjwz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/87pw1e2cj/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>He also has a neck bracket for attaching him to his rocket glider, so it seems like he doesn&#39;t come with a cape.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/k9l9vhlur/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>That&#39;s too bad. Batman wouldn&#39;t be Batman without a Batarang, so Lego has provided him with one plus an extra. Overall, very well done. I just wish there was a cape. Next up: Lex Luthor!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ujnoupokz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>I haven&#39;t been able to get any Lex Luthor up until this point, so I&#39;m very happy to be getting this one. I&#39;m a huge fan of his Pacific Rim-esque armor. It&#39;s so very well detailed, front and back. The purple on his torso seems almost sparkly, which is a bit odd. Lex&#39;s face is the same.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/pwhmt9e6b/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><br />
There&#39;s no weapons for him yet, but he&#39;ll get some later, according to the box. This the best battle ready Lex Luthor Lego has made yet. Now, moving on to the build. Here are the pieces we have to work with:&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/6fwx6dvtf/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Here&#39;s some of the more notable ones:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/dhuut19ub/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>That black quarter circle! So awesome! The build starts out fairly simple. I think I&#39;m building the Bat-Glider.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/4mu0iisrn/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Time to add some weapons and stickers.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/f9ntnyo2b/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Definitely the Bat-Glider. Lex would never use something like this...unless, off course, he had Batman captive and was trying to trick the other League Members. Two wings later and we&#39;re done!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/ra4oaj5yr/9.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" />&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/i12i0u4wz/8.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Moving on to the mech itself.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/bam0re2bn/7.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>That&#39;s an odd color for this set...aaannndd...we&#39;re done!&nbsp;This is the first time I&#39;ve noticed that those throttle pieces come preassembled. This is a neat little thing. It&#39;s Lex&#39;s escape pod/cockpit.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/hbjpohrir/6.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/lxftwti6r/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Here is it&#39;s flight mode.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/6byicw8tf/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>We&#39;re left with a decent extras pile.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/idtw6z56b/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Moving on to bag #2, things get more interesting: it&#39;s time to build Cheetah! &nbsp;I don&#39;t know much about this character but it&#39;s nice to see a new villain. Cheetah has two expressions: villainously happy or angry.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/l7x1kbzlv/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/tq6hoq3kj/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Her hair isn&#39;t new, but it&#39;s pretty neat anyway. Her tail is rubbery and is currently exclusive in this color. It is a slight bit lighter than her skin/fur or whatever she has. Fortunately it isn&#39;t too noticeable. She comes equipped with a spear. She also has one of the three new Energy Infusers from this wave of DC sets. It consists of four pieces , including the highly useful 1x1 gold cylinder printed with the Lexcorp logo. Very well done Lego!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/l0e01n6c3/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Moving back to the build it seems we&#39;ve started the mech&#39;s torso. Another funky colored piece. Weird.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/6h6v0cfsz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Three stickers&nbsp;and a surprisingly complex build later, we&#39;re done the torso.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/53f84ldub/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The legs come next. We get these parts in purple, which is pretty neat.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/nizp1w4sj/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Those legs were a very interesting build. The stickers are pretty tough though. I got mine a bit lower than I would have liked, but it doesn&#39;t look too bad.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/rs4f4bv9v/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Here&#39;s our extras from this bag.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/bh4b7zg77/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Bag #3 is next! Wonder Woman &nbsp;is the first thing we build. She&#39;s the classic version, similar to the one from the&nbsp;old Lex Luthor mech set.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/j9uz016rn/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately she has no arm printing or dual molded legs. The printing wraps around her legs nicely though and her skin tone matches her face and arms pretty good despite being printed on red.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/xt241fs6r/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>While she does look very similar to the one from Superman Vs Power Armor Lex, she isn&#39;t the same at all. She has all new prints and a new exclusive face.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/pasnx7gk3/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Her hair and lasso are the same as previous versions, Oddly, my set came with and extra lasso.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/6igsto26b/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Overall, a nice minifigure but probably the least interesting for me. The next thing we&#39;ll be building is the feet. The feet are nice and wide, allowing this mech to stand on it&#39;s own very easily.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/w2j2zpakz/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at what we have so far. We&#39;re lookin&#39; very very good!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/6wi4t0ehf/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The arms are next...ok, the upper arms are done.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/8bjphq7ur/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The last bag awaits!&nbsp;Finally we get to build Firestorm!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/friz3gioj/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>He looks so awesome! Simpler design, bright colors, flaming head! He&#39;s everything a good superhero should be and more. His head is made of some other type of plastic than usual, so it&#39;s a slightly different color. The fire is molded to his head like Ghost Rider.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/l2xvo7uhf/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The head plastic seems slightly lower quality, but not the flame itself. Firestorm still looks awesome though! Now we can take a closer look at the new flame pieces! Oooohh...two large flames, two small, two fist-on-fire pieces, two twirling fire streams, a small splat, as Jangbricks calls it and a large splat.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/54p5y4i9v/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/5u7yahb3n/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Lego did a good thing here with these pieces. I like them a lot. After we add some flame, 1x1 trans-orange studs with holes and the new 1x2 rounded plate to Firestorm and the large flames to the Bat-rocket-glider, it&#39;s time to finish the mech.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/friz3pb1f/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>We have only to build the axe now. I love how this looks so far, except the hands look too small and Yoda-like. The stud shooter on top is great for play and the ball joint that it&#39;s attached to makes it extremely hard for our heroes to find a blind spot on this thing. The back looks a tad plain, but those stabilizing thrusters or whatever they are help add some detail.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/muquji3o3/image.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>And after we finish the massive Kryptonite axe&nbsp;we&#39;re done! It looks great! It has amazing stability and excellent poseability.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/hxd9xur8z/53.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>The stability is only occasionally compromised by the friction in the ankle joints. At least on mine, those joints are slightly loose, which can cause the mech to fall, but the feet are wide enough to mostly compensate and keep the mech upright.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/5iqhxkpgz/55.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;I&#39;ve been sitting here writing this review for a couple hours now and since my Lego photography area is rather small, I&#39;m beginning to get cramped, so let&#39;s wrap this up.</p>

<p><br />
OVERALL<br />
For $40, the box feels rather small, but it&#39;s actually a fair price, since the stuff you get actually could have been put in a box twice the size. Five minifigures, all currently exclusive, the Bat-rocket-glider and the mech for $40 is pretty good. Oh yeah, and the new flame pieces plus all these extras.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/mw0scexmr/56.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>Extra quarter circle! (Drools).</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://s19.postimg.org/bky4oi8wj/57.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>For a side build, the Bat-rocket-glider is really well designed. I could see the Bat-rocket-glider, Batman and Cheetah being a small set. That&#39;s how cool it is. The mech is a very welcome addition to my mech/brick built creatures collection. It&#39;s also a huge improvement over the last Lex Luthor mech. It&#39;s more bulky, has better color scheme and is generally more dangerous looking. The minifig selection is pretty much perfect.</p>

<p><br />
PROS</p>

<p><br />
Great Pieces<br />
Batman<br />
Wonder Woman<br />
Firestorm<br />
Cheetah<br />
Lex Luthor<br />
New Flames aka Power Bursts<br />
1x2 rounded plate<br />
Excellent Mech<br />
Bat-rocket-glider<br />
Fair price</p>

<p><br />
CONS</p>

<p>No Cape for Batman<br />
Hard stickers<br />
No arm printing or dual molding for Wonder Woman<br />
1x2 rounded plate limits Firestorm&#39;s leg movement (Easy fix)<br />
Slightly inferior quality (seemingly) of Firestorm&#39;s head</p>

<p><br />
There&#39;s another odd thing that isn&#39;t really a con, but usually these Super Heroes sets come with a little comic book. This set didn&#39;t come with one. Despite that, I would definitely recommend this set &nbsp;to any Lego fan. Hopefully you enjoyed this review style.&nbsp;</p>

-Fowlerbricks Out!</p>

<p><br />
WAIT! Don&#39;t go. I forgot to mention that there are multiple places to attach Firestorm using power bursts to the mech and places to attach all the Energy Infusers, presumably to increase the mech&#39;s power.</p>

"Kaisermighe","2018-09-08T13:09:32.23Z","Mech-Luthor is back and better than ever!!","<p>This huge Lego&nbsp;Mech-Luthor&nbsp;is very cool. Ok one thing at a time!</p>

<p>First off, every character&nbsp;here is actually good and&nbsp;interesting (and for this set-size, 5 minifigs&nbsp;is great). You have Wonder Woman with her lazo&nbsp;of truth (but were&#39;s her bracelets?), all-new Firestorm with a lot of pretty cool&nbsp;fire-based rays, Tigra&nbsp;with her simple spear (but very good details), Batman clad in grey&nbsp;with his big chunky jetpack&nbsp;(looks like a glider to me if you reverse it) and of course, Luthor himself wearing his armour. My only criticism here is about lazy leg design (all plain colours except&nbsp;for wonderwoman, and especially on lex and batman that made them look like wearing pajamas). Also, i&#39;ve preferred to see a bulky armour&nbsp;brick for lex (like the version for the junior set, to me is more comic-wise!) and i&#39;m not &nbsp;big fan of the big bat-jetpack. While it&#39;s not bad, i think we&#39;ve seen too many of this, and this one is especially cumbersome and it gave me no Batman-feel in his design. But it&#39;s just some minor complaint really, for playing around is just perfect, coupled with twin stud-shooters as well (also i like the transparent brick to easly&nbsp;attach Batman to his vehicle).</p>

<p>Luthor&#39;s mech is really big, it looks good and is really designed to play with. Articulations work&nbsp;nicely, there&#39;s a rotable&nbsp;gun with 6 stud-shooters on top, jetpack-like turbines in the back(maybe for making big jumps or hover in the air),&nbsp;detachable&nbsp;cabin for lex to pilot it which became an escape pod with folding wings (also carrying two guns for&nbsp;self-defence), awesome golden claws and a giant crazy kryptonite&nbsp;axe!! Also there&#39;s some clips to attach the three collectible energy infusers you find in this wave (here there&#39;s the green one), and in the back there&#39;s more to attach superman&#39;s kriptonite prison, which is in not included. Really a lot of details on this big guy, and it&#39;s also very stable (also actually cool stickers).</p>

<p>What&#39;s not love here? For a perfect price on retail you got great playability, a big green-violet Mech-Luthor&nbsp;and 5 good minifigures&nbsp;with full weaponry, plus Batman&#39;s&nbsp;jetpack!! All Lego superheros sets should be like this one.</p>
