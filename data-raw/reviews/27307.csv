It includes Cyborg&#39;s helicopter, Killer Frost&#39;s car, and 4 minifigures. It was released in 2018 for $29.99 and has 271 pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Flash- </strong>This is a new minifigure for The Flash that has nice new torso printing. It has gold outlines on the torso and has the standard Flash mask piece. 9.5/10</p>

<p><strong>Cyborg- </strong>This new version of Cyborg has great new printing for the torso. 9.5/10</p>

<p><strong>Reverse Flash- </strong>This is the first Reverse Flash minifigure we have got in Lego. He has good&nbsp;printing and is a great minifigure to get.10/10</p>

<p><strong>Killer Frost- </strong>This is also the first time we have got a Killer Frost Minifigure in Lego. She has decent printing and is nice to get. 8/10</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The builds in this set are ok but not the best. Cyborg&#39;s helicopter is good and has some nice play features. It has stud shooters and a canon that can shoot a net out. Killer Frost&#39;s car is not that great and looks out of place. It has stud shooters but it doesn&#39;t look good at all. 6/10</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>This set has good minifigures but the builds lack a little. I like Cyborg&#39;s helicopter but Killer Frost&#39;s car looks bad. This set has decent play features and all the figures look nice. If you are a flash fan then it would be nice to get this set but otherwise you can pass.&nbsp;</p>
