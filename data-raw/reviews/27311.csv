<p>I was lucky to work with Kevin on this project for the Hong Kong certified store. I wasnt involved in the rose itself, but with the even more limited micro Beauty and the Beast castle building event.</p>

<p>This may only be a small set, but the attention to detail is flawless. The rose itself is fairly simple, using readily available parts, but it really is a great likeness and fun build. The instructions were nicely designed, and easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The special dome really finishes it off, and makes it a perfect collectors piece that you can actually display, without worrying about it getting dusty or damaged.</p>
