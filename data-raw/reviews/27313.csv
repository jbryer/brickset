"martiniman","2022-05-08T22:00:53.32Z","As BIG as the real building","<p>Three years ago we visited the Lego House and I thought this set is probably cheaper in the Netherlands as most sets are. Not knowing it is a Lego House exclusive... So I left without buying, regretting it when I saw Bricklink and Ebay prices.</p>

<p>This year we took another shot. I visited Legoland, made a quick stop by the Lego House to get this set, built it in the evening and visited the expo inside the Lego House the next day.</p>

<h3>About the building</h3>

<p>Being an architect, the real building is a bucket list item for must visit modern architecture. It is the white version of the total black <a href=""https://zumthor.org/images_800px/thermeint1.jpg"">Therme Vals</a> by Peter Zumthor in Switzerland. This time no bathing house, but a toy brick house. The Therme being the Yin, the Lego House is its Yang. Both are &quot;negative space&quot; buildings: the experience of space is created in the void between a stack of rectangular boxes.</p>

<p>Both buildings start from the law that demands a certain height of a stair step. Guess here it is like 17 or 18 cm. Take the 2x4 basic Lego brick, which is 32x16x10mm, you could transpose the aspect and get 18x60x30cm, assuming they rounded the length and width to the common building grid size of 30cm.</p>

<p>From that starting point, every detail is a multiplication of that base shape. BIG architects went very far: even the sinks in the toilets are derived from the 3D grid and have the famous stud cut out from the brick shape. So do the exposition cabinets, interactive displays and most furniture. All follow the great master plan.</p>

<p>Fun fact is that I would have assumed the concept was rigid rectangular tubes intersecting to hold the whole thing up and create a massive interior square, yet BIG originally put columns underneath only to have the Lego CEO to insist to removing them. Sometimes the principal is the true constructional visionary!</p>

<p>Where the building is top-notch throughout, A++ in detailing, material use, the location is a total failure. Where Yin is situated on a mountain slope in the Swiss Alps, the Lego House stands on a spot where the former town hall was torn down. For your idea: Billund is a shithole with 6194 residents. This building is worth being on the harbour in K&oslash;benhavn! So the Lego house is like if St. Peters Basilica was built on Elba. Or Wembly Stadium being built for Glossop North End FC.</p>

<h2>Box and booklet</h2>

<p>The box is the standard Lego architecture style. It is rather tall, the box could have been much smaller. The depth on the other hand is just one stud too shallow. You can&#39;t fit the finished model in unless you remove the black trim on one side.</p>

<p>The booklet is nice, but I could not find the fun facts on the paper version. The download version comes in different languages and has fun fact insert on several pages. Some colours are hard to separate. Especially the greens and orange/red flavours.</p>

<p>Distribution of bricks throughout the plastic bag is messy and feels very random. You need to sort them before starting to build. Too many pieces look too similar.</p>

<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>The building experience is among the best of all Lego sets. It is complex, every brick out of the 21 stacked is slightly different and a nice puzzle, always surprising you with its final appearance. If you are very precise, you can take some time to have all 1x1 tiles aligned straight to get the pictures nice.</p>

<p>The set is a lot more detailed and quite a bit larger than <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4000010-1/LEGO-House"">400010</a>. Also it has the much-needed colour not in the original model.</p>

<h2>Final appearance</h2>

<p>The final appearance of the set is every bit as astonishing as the real building. It is really nice how you can take off the top 5 bricks to peek inside, how the windows are incorporated, how the exterior space walls are made and how the two stairs are captured with 1x1 tiles. If you look to the main hall, you see the lego tree surrounded by the stairs that lead you up to the master builder gallery in the top brick. The shop where you buy this set is under the yellow exterior stairs.</p>

<p>There is a little problem with the model: the name is on the wrong side, you would expect it to be on the side of the main entrance, yet it is on the rear facade. This is an easy fix though, just swap 5 black tiles. The original 400010 does have the name on the right side of the building.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.martijnkoch.com/technic/21037-1.jpg"" style=""width: 1200px; height: 798px;"" /></p>

<p>I think this set is a must-have for Lego Architecture fans. The model is very gay and expressive. It puts a smile on your face.</p>

<h2>Getting possession of it</h2>

<p>21037 is a Lego House exclusive set, not sold outside the museum. So you either have to find some Ebay scalper to collect it for you with a steep markup, or you need to go to frigging Billund yourself. Which is kind of hard considering it to be in the middle of nowhere.</p>

<p>I found the museum experience inside to be sub par, especially for the money they ask (40&euro; per person). The city is obnoxious and total nonsense to visit. So that leaves 2 reasons to get there. 1) you are an architecture freak, and you need to see the building for your top of the World contemporary architecture bucket-list or 2) you are a parent that got persuaded by kids to visit Legoland, which is the only half decent amusement park in the southern part of Jutland and a good visit for amusement rides. In the second case make sure you pull your kids out of the park before 17:30, so you can just make it to the Lego House shop before it closes at 18.00. Or better, go there by yourself and leave your partner with the kids and an ice-cream in Legoland till it closes. If kids see the shop, you are duped.</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Astonishing building captured in a fantastic Lego model</li>
	<li>Truly great building experience</li>
	<li>Very expressive and gay looks</li>
	<li>Great experience in combination with a visit of the real building</li>
	<li>Nice box and attention drawing item in your architecture office or Lego cave.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Bad</h2>

<ul>
	<li>Name is on the wrong side of the floor plate. It should be at the main entrance side like with the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4000010-1/LEGO-House"">400010</a> set. You can easily correct this.</li>
	<li>Price is Danish-Krone inflated. Outside Denmark an architecture set this size would be 40-45&euro;, now it is 60&euro;. Ebay-scalper inflated you must think roughly 100&euro; to get it.</li>
	<li>Box is a bit too small to fit the model. But you probably don&#39;t want that anyway.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The Ugly</h2>

<ul>
	<li>The set is too hard to get hold of. Billund is the navel lint of Denmark. The stupidest dull town of them all. And yet they have this several-hundreds-of-million-Euros building that competes in the Champions League of Contemporary Architecture. Visiting Billund is sadly your best ticket to get this marvellous set. But it does offer you the experience of the real building! Well maybe you should visit the building and the rooftop <em>without entering the museum</em>. That will ensure you to put your focus on the magnificent building, and forget about Lego for a moment!</li>
</ul>

<p>Yes, I was on a birthday treat trip to the home of Lego with my kids. A must-visit is obviously the Lego House assuming&nbsp;you&#39;re a fan - I&#39;d presume so if you are visiting this site&nbsp;</p>

<p>The house is amazing, and in the shop lies this set, amongst other exclusives (also purchased)</p>

<p>This is a display set and has no real play value unless you add in&nbsp;storm troopers and an AT AT at scale destroying it in some obscure multiverse battle - so really I wouldn&#39;t go out your way to get this for the kids</p>

<p>The build uses several simple but clever techniques to attach the modular rooms that the building&#39;s comprised of. Starting as usual with architecture sets, there&#39;s a standard tiled baseplate that grows around the central stairwell / tree of life true to the origin. Slowly it expands to the final 8 piece structure topping iconic piece.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not a long build, but unlike a lot more glamorous sets, keeps you engaged right to the final block</p>

<p>The final model looks great - is extremely accurate for the scale, and is so colourful</p>

<p>It&#39;s a must if you have been and enjoyed the location....... why ?? Well firstly it will always remind you of the fun times had during your visit and secondly, it&#39;s actually the first model my wife has allowed me showcase in the living room !!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s a high endorsement&nbsp;I can say !&nbsp;</p>
