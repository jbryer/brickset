<p>The minigifs here aren&#39;t anything special, but I wouldn&#39;t really expect anything else from a holiday vignette. The farmer is pretty similar to the one released as part of the Minigifures&nbsp;Series 15, while the &quot;daughter&quot; is also pretty ordinary-looking. I do like the brick-built birds: as much as I appreciate it when LEGO releases new animal molds, there&#39;s more joy in building the turkey by hand and seeing it come together.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a great selection of veggies and fruit in the set, along with a small garden/field. As a veggie lover, this was, frankly, one of the biggest reasons I got the set. You&#39;ve got carrots, apples, pumpkins and a bunch of other assorted roots and stems (although I still haven&#39;t figured out if the yellow cones are supposed to be a very short-stemmed corn or an upright-growing squash).</p>

<p>The autumn tree is well-made and offers some rare parts like the brown tree canopy and orange flowers. The biggest part of the set is the horse-drawn carriage... although the horse itself is nowhere to be seen. This is, I think, the biggest flaw of the set, and a pretty baffling one. I understand that the holiday vignettes have a size limit, but including a farmhorse figure would have given the set much more play value and charm.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, this is a good set for its money - pretty and yet useful, especially if you&#39;re looking to expand your city with an agricultural area.</p>

Despite that I&#39;m positive that even non-American fans of Lego get all tingly when a new wave of holiday sets is announced. Actually, excluding the turkey, this set could be sold as autumn harvest and nobody would blink an eye.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First of all I have to congratulate the designers for choosing the perfect autumn colour palette. That was the selling point for me. If you love warm, earthy, autumn colour tones, you&#39;ll be amazed how many of those are present here. And despite the variety, they really complement each other.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You get three separate builds - a vegetable patch, a tree, and a cart/wagon. All of them are done nicely, the tree and the patch fit together well. You get a couple of accessories like a brick-built scarecrow and a basket with some produce. The cart&#39;s design suggests it should be pulled manually; however, it&#39;s far too large for a minifig. I can confirm that you can attach a horse to it using a&nbsp;standard carriage shaft once you remove the 1x2 black plate with snap. It definitely looks better&nbsp;in this modified configuration. My only tiny critique is that you cannot fit the basket onto the wagon. (Well, technically you can but it doesn&#39;t look right.) Anyway, that&#39;s just me nitpicking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs are your standard fare, a farmer and a young girl. Two brick-built birds are included, which is always a nice touch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, it&#39;s a lovely, enjoyable autumn mini-build. The price is right for what you get and the Thanksgiving references are so subtle that even if you&#39;re not a fan of this holiday, it shouldn&#39;t bother you. &nbsp;</p>

However each portion is relatively simple, there are no issues or difficult steps. I especially enjoy the two buildable animals included in the set, they&rsquo;re quite cleverly constructed and add to the overall feeling of the set once completed.</span></span></span></span></p>

The little patch of garden has a very nice looking buildable scarecrow and some greens and veggies, the shoots unfortunately don&rsquo;t like to stay in place very well and the small size of the garden area does suffer a bit from being a tad too small for decent placement of the foliage.</span></span></span></span></p>
