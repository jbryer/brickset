The print on the figure is really nice with the opened hoodie-jacket and the revealed ninja-suit under it, and I like the new version of the hood. I hope we&#39;ll see that hood in a lot of other colours - mostly I wish for black... or very dark grey... ;-) Unfortunately we only get a one-sided-head, but that&#39;s o.k. for me, cause the angry/annoyed face looks quite intimidating and really suits him well. I also appreciate that they gave us the new sword and the tassle-piece with that figure. First of all, you never can have enough swords, when you are collecting &quot;martial-art-LEGO&quot;, and the also brandnew tassle-piece is always welcome in my repertoire of useable pieces.</p>

<p>But we even get some more:</p>

<p>With that figure you get a small sheet that tells you how to put the tassel on the sword... btw who needs that?!? The rest of this side of the sheet is covered with a picture of Lloyd dressed in his ninja-suit in action doing a kick and the well known #BENINJA. So to say a nice micro-poster from the main character of the film. The other side features another micro-poster of the movie, with all the heroes in front and in the background the city of Ninjago threatened by a very large, grim looking Garmadon. I think a lot of kids and will like that. All together this is an outstanding figure that I can recommend to every Ninjago-fan!</p>

<p>As far as Minifigures go Lloyd is everywhere in The LEGO Ninjago Movie, you&#39;ll have a lot of them, which makes sense as he is the main hero character of the film. In the recently reviewed LEGO NINJAGO City Chase, Lloyd is dressed in this outfit minus the hood, in the CMF series he is wearing this outfit with the hood and a cereal bowl, but in this polybag you get his ninja sword accessory and a single-sided serious looking facial print with the hood and an unzipped jacket print showing his Ninja outfit underneath.</p>

<p>Basically this is Lloyd as he&#39;s mid-transformation from civilian clothes to Ninja clothes. Great for fans who want to collect every variant of the outfit worn by Lloyd in the NINJAGO movie, not great if you wanted something more. Still this is a greatly detailed minifigure and the hood piece is a really welcome sculpt for head pieces, I hope to see it re-used in LEGO City quite often in different colours for all those folks wearing blue and orange sweater jackets like Lloyd is wearing here. Recommended for fans, casual collectors may wish to skip it.</p>

<p>Comes in normal polybag bag and has the normal size polybag instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Besides the normal minifigure parts the sword and gold end of it are really nice pieces to get.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigure:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Lloyd new hood is really nice with some of his hair showing. His jacket is really nice as well. He only has a singled sided head. The detail on him is decent (not the best not the worst). It shows his jacket and ninja uniform under it. There is a little printing on his with a belt.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Just building a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall this is a good figure from the Lego Ninjago&nbsp;Movie. The new sword, gold end of the sword, and hood/hair piece are really good pieces. The sword is my favorite part of the set. The new was a great idea that I really like. Overall this is a great Lego Ninjago&nbsp;Movie character which is why I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>
