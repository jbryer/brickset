<p>Quite good for a small model, with SNOT techniques.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set has the most parts of all 2017 mini-models,&nbsp;and they are a great mix of Technic and System parts, including&nbsp;tiles, plates, brackets, sloped and curved bricks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set has two spare parts, round 1x1 plates in black and grey.&nbsp;My daughter found a use for them:&nbsp;the black one went on the round red part at the front,&nbsp;and the grey one inside the cabin, as a light on the ceiling.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>Mini-models are mainly display models. This one can be played with.&nbsp;The wheels turn (due to the use of Technic axle pins) and&nbsp;there is a ball joint at the back (not seen on the photo) to attach a carriage.&nbsp;Unfortunately, like all mini-models, this one is not at minifig scale.&nbsp;The cabin is too narrow and small to even contain a child minifig.</p>

<h3>Value for money</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a giveaway from Lego, no purchase necessary.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>2017 was a great year of colourful, varied and original monthly mini-models.&nbsp;It ends on a high note: the December model is an appropriately seasonal&nbsp;toy steam locomotive in red.</p>

<p>Most mini-models look best from the angle shown on the official Lego photo.&nbsp;From the side or back, they are often quite &#39;blocky&#39;.&nbsp;Not this model: it looks great from all angles.</p>

<p>Add the amount and variety of parts, the building experience,&nbsp;the playability and extendability (by adding carriages),&nbsp;and you&#39;ve got the perfect monthly mini-model.</p>

<p>2017 will be a hard act to follow for the MMMB designers...</p>
