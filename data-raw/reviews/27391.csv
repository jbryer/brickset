<p>&nbsp;This is the 9th buildable figure that I own and it is one of the most detailed one so far. I can only imagine that with time, these set will become more and more sophisticated, just like the regular SW LEGO sets. The assembly process is pretty straight forward if you are somewhat experienced builder. Nothing much to say there.</p>

<p>Now, I was expecting this set to be just like the&nbsp;75107 model,&nbsp;Jango Fett, from 2015 with a different paint job, but I was wrong. First, this figure is taller than the older one. Not by much but still. It is also much more detailed, which is normal given that it has 144 pieces compared to the 85 that make up Jango. The jet pack is larger and more complex, its missile looks better (no longer uses a lego cup piece) and the thrusters on the side can be rotated, which is a nitpick for me. Also, there are some pouches both sides around the figures waist and the scope on the helmet is buildable too. Again, a nitpick for me, but I am sure that many will find this a positive thing.The weapon is also better with this model, the 2 small pistols have been replaced with a blaster, like the stormtroopers have, but it has been customized. There is a scope on it which really looks cool and it also has a stock, making the blaster longer and more mean looking. The figure also comes with Boba&nbsp;Fetts&nbsp;signature cape. I have to mention that a serious improvement has been done where the legs connect to the body, as in the case of Jango, that connection is rather exposed. Here, the plates covering the legs are better designed and the entire thing looks more natural, there are no structural parts left exposed.</p>

<p>The printing on the parts are&nbsp;a major plus. The amount of detail they offer is huge. I dont think that I have seen any buildable figures so far with printing on the leg plates. Or on the shoulders for that matter, where the mandalorian&nbsp;seal can be found. The colour scheme is also so much better here than on Jango. The green and the gray mix well and the splashes of yellow, red and blue create a much more pleasant overall picture than Jangos&nbsp;silver and blue.</p>

<p>A special mention must go to this figures head piece, which is the most detailed headpiece I have seen&nbsp;so far. The dent in Boba&nbsp;Fetts&nbsp;helmet is not painted, there is an actual &quot;dent&quot; there. Also, the way it is painted is just beautiful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The price of this figure is on the more expensive side, as I had to pay around 38$ (after conversion). This is not the most expensive figure, by far, at least not where I live, but still, I would have liked it to be somewhat cheaper... However, I cannot complain much as I am satisfied with the final product, it is a quality build, and it will look awesome next to the other figures.</p>

<p>The build of this figure is very well put together and has some incredible detail like on the legs, arms, chest and especially the helmet with a great moulded dent on top and also has the antenna which can rotate. He is also equipped with his signature blaster which can fire a spring loaded shooter. He also has a small green cloth piece on his shoulder. There is also a great build for his jet pack which has moving thrusters at the bottom and a flick fire missel launcher on his back, just like the Jango Fett buildable figure.</p>

<p>Overall I would say this is is definitely one of the best buildable figures and definitely deserved the long wait. The only issues I have is that some times small parts can easily be knocked off and the price seems a little high for what you get nether the less I would 100% recommend this set as it looks amazing for desplay and is great for play.</p>

"Lego_fan_","2019-03-02T09:44:47.087Z","Possible detail.","<p>This set is an amazing set and looks nice set or display. It has detailed print on his legs, chest arms, and best of all his helmet. The helmet looks very true to the films and has a possible&nbsp;antenna on it. It also has a possible head, Arms. legs, and a blaster that can shoot a spring loaded shooter and store an extra on the side. It has a nice looking cape hanging from the neck which some what covers the Jet pack. The Jet pack has possible bits to is and a flick missile&nbsp;on the back. Although it is not a great set for play, it is great for display and would be highly praise this set to any Star Wars fans or Lego Fans!</p>
