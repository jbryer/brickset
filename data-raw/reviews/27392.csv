<p><strong>Parts: 5/5</strong></p>

<p>I not a&nbsp;MOCist in the least bit, so the variation of parts isn&#39;t something I really focus on. However, but this set definitely has some parts worth mentioning. This set contains 8&nbsp;parts with some amazing and accurate printing to fully replicate Darth Vader&#39;s appearance: 6&nbsp;CCBS shells (including the torso) and 2&nbsp;slopes. Not to mention two capes for further accuracy. And of course, the incredible&nbsp;redesigned two piece helmet/head. Since others have mentioned it, I should note the returning black Technic bushings. They seem popular.</p>

<p>Lego still refuses to use black <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-74261"">friction adders</a> though, but that&#39;s something I&#39;ve given up on at this point.&nbsp;I also would&#39;ve preferred the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-90613"">bones</a>&nbsp;used in the upper legs to&nbsp;be black, which isn&#39;t a new color for that piece either (more why&nbsp;later).</p>

<p><strong>Build: 4.5/5</strong></p>

<p>As with pretty much all buildable figures, all the interesting building is in the torso. And boy was it interesting! The most unique aspect was creating the base of the neck and spine, which was a subassembly that you slide into place and the lock into place from the front. And then you add a structure of technic panels to give the torso coverage as well as to hold his waist cape.&nbsp;Limbs were standard fare. Overall it was a thoroughly enjoyable build.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: 3.75/5</strong></p>

<p>The first major feature of this set is the new removable helmet. It pops on and off easily enough, and Vader&#39;s face underneath is a great sculpt. The right arm swings its lightsaber using a gear function, which is nothing new and works fine.</p>

<p>Now for articulation... this is where the set runs into some snags. Neck and arms are standard (though I wish Lego would use elbows like they did on 75111.) However, the leg articulation is rather disappointing. The legs don&#39;t swing forward very much before hitting the technic panels on the sides. They also collide frequently&nbsp;with the shell used for the codpiece,&nbsp;meaning I either have to readjust it frequently or leave it lopsided, which is very noticeable because&nbsp;it&#39;s a printed piece. Knees only bend about 45 degrees, and leave a gap the shows the gray bone underneath, ruining Vader&#39;s black color scheme. This would&#39;ve been less noticeable if the bones were cast in black instead, which isn&#39;t even a new color for that piece. Ankle&nbsp;articulation is pretty good actually. The hampered leg articulation greatly limits dynamic posing.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money: 3/5</strong></p>

<p>The retail for this set is a rather whopping $39.99. The price can be justified by the amount of large parts, highly detailed printed parts, the two large capes, and the very complex head sculpt. However, the final product doesn&#39;t feel like its worth $40. Sure, this Vader is tall (over 12 inches), but that&#39;s about it, especially compared to&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75112-1/General-Grievous"">75112 Grievous</a>, who has more mass and shelf presence and even then was just barely worth its $35 price. A better comparison could probably be made with the more recent&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75530-1/Chewbacca"">75530 Chewbacca</a>, which also cost $35 and also came with many large printed shells. However, I don&#39;t have Chewbacca so I can&#39;t properly judge that. Still, I feel $35 would have been a far better price point, but personally I feel it&#39;s worth $30.</p>

<p>Fortunately for me, I got him for&nbsp;$21.53 plus tax during an Amazon sale. At that price, this set is definitely worth it.</p>

<p><strong>Overall: 3/5</strong></p>

<p>As shocking as it may sound, I find myself not liking this set very much. As a big fan of poseability, the hampered leg articulation really kills it for me. To be fair, Vader himself hardly moves his legs, but it&#39;s something I would expect with a $40 figure.</p>

<p>The set is also&nbsp;<em>ridiculously</em>&nbsp;tall: 12.4in/32cm&nbsp;compared to the standard 9.4in/24 cm. While I appreciate that the idea of making a&nbsp;big Vader figure, he is grossly out of scale with other buildable figures. Darth&nbsp;Vader is 6&#39;8&quot;/2.03m tall, yet this set&nbsp;is taller than Chewbacca&#39;s figure, which represents a character that is 7&#39;6&quot;/2.23m tall. He&#39;s not fun to play with the rest of my collection since he just towers over everyone else when he doesn&#39;t need to.</p>

<p>Along with this ludicrous height is wonky proportions. He feels too skinny and his legs and/or torso are&nbsp;too&nbsp;long. And of course, the high retail price is yet another downer.</p>

<p>Despite my numerous issues with this set, I can still appreciate it for being a massive improvement in accuracy compared to the original Vader buildable figure. It is more streamlined than the chunky looking 2015 Vader and the new head, new printed shells, and the added waist cape are gorgeous upgrades, more faithfully recreating his look in the films.</p>

<p>On his own, 75534 Darth Vader does make a good display piece. If that&#39;s what you want, or if you want a better looking Vader, get this figure. I won&#39;t recommend displaying it with the rest of the Star Wars buildable figures unless you find a way to make him shorter. Whatever your choice is, I only recommend&nbsp;getting this if you can find it at a discount.&nbsp;</p>
