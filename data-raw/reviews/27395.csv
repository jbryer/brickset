<p>New building techniques in the arms allow for the figure to move&nbsp;his arms in a fluid manner whilst wielding his trademark double edged lightsaber, the look of the face is amazing capturing the likeness of the character perfectly, very pose-able figure which looks great on display.</p>

<p>I know these figures are not everyone&rsquo;s thing, but I for one am going to miss them I think there was lots more figures that could have been made, yes the human heads do not look as good as the helmeted figures etc, but it&rsquo;s a good line that hopefully Lego will bring back one day, until then I highly recommend this figure to fans of the series.&nbsp;</p>
