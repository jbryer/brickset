Unless You're A General Grievous Fan","<p>This is really nothing more than an oversized/glorified speeder bike with practically zero features with a price per piece to frown at. On the upside, you can get a nice Mace Windo and really nice General Grievous figure.</p>

<p>The vehicle seems utterly pointless with a design that I feel doesn&#39;t make sense at all. When at the speeder controls Grievous&#39; head sits awkwardly above the elongated dashboard. I hate to say it, but this is one of those sets where Lego just needed to offload some surplus pieces of parts&nbsp;for which&nbsp;it couldn&#39;t find any better use.&nbsp;</p>

"Echolord","2018-06-24T20:37:49.917Z","""General Grievous, you're shorter than I expected.""","<p>The droid army of the Confederacy of Independent Systems was lead by the cyborg General Grievous, a cruel machine who stocked his own personal fleet of impressive and bizarre vehicles. This set marks the third of these vehicles to be released - following the two releases of his TSMEU-6&nbsp;personal wheel bike (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7255-1/General-Grievous-Chase"">7255: General Grievous Chase</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75040-1/General-Grievous-Wheel-Bike"">75040: General Grievous&#39; Wheel Bike</a>) and the two releases of his Belbullab-22 starfighter, the&nbsp;<em>Soulless One</em>&nbsp;(<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7656-1/General-Grievous-Starfighter"">7656: General Grievous Starfighter</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8095-1/General-Grievous-Starfighter"">8095: General Grievous&#39; Starfighter</a>) - representing his personal speeder, which appeared in the fifth season of the popular animated television show&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars,&nbsp;</em>along with an appearance in the unfinished episodes which make up the seventh season.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When this set was announced, and leaks began to appear for the figures, I was thrilled. LEGO was releasing another set from the Clone Wars era, and it had an updated Mace Windu. It was only after the price was established, a whopping $29.99 in the United States, for a mere 157 pieces, that I realized this only looked good. Despite the price though, I had to get it. I waited though, hoping it would go on sale, and eventually broke down and requested it for my birthday.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>The set contains two fairly popular characters from the show, and the pre-Galactic Empire era: Jedi Master Mace Windu, and General Grievous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Master Windu&#39;s figure is entirely new, with exclusive prints on all three pieces that make up his character. The legs are no longer molded in white, and instead feature a band of white printing which depicts the pants worn under his sand yellow tunic. In my opinion, this design works far better than the previous design, which left the legs looking awkward from behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/MN/0/sw889.png"" style=""width: 240px; height: 320px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/MN/0/sw479.png"" style=""width: 240px; height: 320px;"" /></p>

<p>In addition, the updated torso features a very realistic looking design, with creases and natural folds in the fabric that the previous torso did not have, as it was based on his appearance in the Clone Wars TV show. The new design also features continued printed detail on the back side of the torso, a much needed improvement. Finally, Mace Windu&#39;s head is finally updated with an accurate representation of Samuel L. Jackson&#39;s face, a feature lacking in the previous head, reused from <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/pop011/seso"">Seso</a> in 2010&#39;s Prince of Persia theme.</p>

<p>General Grievous, on the other hand, is not new. His figure is the exact same as the one released in 2014&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75040-1/General-Grievous-Wheel-Bike"">75040</a>. As such, one might expect the same high quality of plastic and detailing. As it turns out, I was to be disappointed. The plastic used in his torso and legs appears to be far flimsier and looser at the hinge points than the previous figure. His legs move far too loosely, and his primary two arms as well. All three of my previous General Grievous minifigures&nbsp;using this set of molds contained solid joints, and near perfect prints. In this particular example, the white print on the torso and arms were smudged and near illegible. Needless to say, I am very disappointed in this apparent drop in quality.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>I want to preface this section by saying that it would be extremely hard for LEGO, using official building techniques, to accurately and proportionately depict this particular vehicle at a smaller scale. The odd angles and curves of the vehicle are extremely unique. And as such, I do need to commend LEGO for what they did, even if it is way out of scale. The choice of parts is reasonable, with the large angular wind deflector represented well, and the large curved slopes that form the sides add excellent shaping.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest issue with the build in my opinion is the scaling of the engine module. The shaping and details are near perfect, but should be larger to more effectively fit the scale of the rest of the model. It feels like this portion was designed for a more accurately scaled to minifigures model, and added when no larger option was possible. It almost makes me wonder if there was a smaller design that was scraped in favor of this larger one, and the engine design was just carried over.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Final Statements</h2>

<p>Upon building and experiencing this set, I very much felt that it is a solid design, and the minifigure selection makes the set pretty great for collectors. However, the price leaves a lot to be desired. This set could reasonably been sold for $19.99 in the U.S. for its 157 pieces, but $30 is asking too much. I have to caution an impulse buy on this set, as you will not be getting $30 worth of parts, or toy. I highly recommend waiting for this set to go on sale at your local retailer, or through LEGO itself. Unless you have a gift card sitting around with no other purpose, I wouldn&#39;t even recommend using that on this set. Quite simply, it is not worth $30.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, if you are a collector who values completion, and desires to acquire items early to prepare for coming waves, then it might be worth getting soon, assuming you&#39;re willing to drop the money on it.&nbsp;</p>

"omnius","2019-03-28T13:15:53.417Z","Excellent minifigures, but a bit pricey","<p>Unless you&#39;re a die-hard Clone Wars fan, you could be forgiven for not recognising this unusual vehicle.Used by General Grievous in just two episodes of that cartoon. Chiefly used by the Confederacy of Independent Systems, there&#39;s little published information on this speeder.</p>

<p>The build itself is fairly straightforward, with the parts divided into two bags. There are four large stickers which require careful fitting, especially the two that go on curved slopes. Once built there is a place for General Grievous to stand (though he can&#39;t really hold onto anything) and an ingenious but simple method for storing his four lightsabres.</p>

<p>As for the figures themselves, they&#39;re the high point of the set. Mace Windu features a single facial expression (not that they had much choice!), and his distinctive purple-bladed lightsabre. Grievous himself is the highlight of the set, and a huge improvement over the original 2005 version. Special praise goes to the head, and the fact he comes with four lightsabres - two with green blades and two with blue.</p>

<p>For playability the vehicle is fairly swooshable, and can be displayed easily. It has two missile launchers, one under each large curved section. If you don&#39;t like this feature, you can just leave the missiles out. The launchers themselves are discreet, so don&#39;t intrude.</p>

<p>The set has one major issue that needs discussing - the price. Retailing at &pound;25.99 in the UK, this set really doesn&#39;t feel like good value for money. I was fortunate enough to pick it up on clearance and I&#39;d urge you to do the same if you want to add this set to your collection.</p>

<p>Overall this is a passable set, worth getting for the excellent minifigures&nbsp;if you can find it at the right price. The speeder itself isn&#39;t bad but is far from iconic, given how little screentime it enjoyed.</p>

"Sobel","2019-02-13T20:32:04.273Z","""Hello there!"" ""General Windu!"" ... wait, that doesn't seem right...","<p>Once again, a pure cashgrab model. This is one of the rare occasions, I have to give a set less than three stars and unfortunately, most of the recent Star-Wars-sets would surely suffer the same fate...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nothing special. A little Technic to support the structure followed by rather basic parts. The shooters are a welcome addition.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two minifigures included, Mace Windu with his awesome cool purple lightsaber and a very much improved General Grievous. My first Grievous was from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7656-1/General-Grievous-Starfighter"">7656 set</a> and it has changed A LOT since then! In fact, this particular minifigure made me give the set more than one star!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very, very simple. Took me 10 minutes while watching TV.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>While looking quite cool, you can see on first sight that this model has absolutely nothing special to it except its design. Only thing you can do is fire the &quot;lasers&quot;. Furthermore, compared to the original design from TCW, it is waaay too big! Go search for pics on Google and you&#39;ll recognize!<br />
Also, as in most recent SW-sets, the additional minifigure has no stand whatsoever and could easily get lost. Why not throw in a piece of &quot;rock&quot; or &quot;ground&quot; made of a few bricks to put Mace on?? Every simple City-set has something like that!?</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>There&#39;s really not much to add. While the minifigures (especially Grievous) are quite cool, the Speeder itself lacks everything that makes a good SW-model for me. No functions but lasers, wannabe cool design but not matching the original and being way too overprized. I got it for 17&euro; on a special sale, but I have to say it was hardly worth it.<br />
That&#39;s just one more stone breaking from the mosaic of epic LEGO-SW-sets...</p>

<p>*Edit*: I just got to put this &quot;set&quot; next to the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60138-1/High-speed-Chase"">60138 Speed Chase</a> from 2017 and it is ridiculous: I got both these sets for the same price! And - just look it up - there is MUCH more to the city set than to the SW-set... *rollseyes*</p>

"Ephseb","2019-02-06T12:18:03.9Z","Too expensive and somewhat inaccurate - but it does have redeeming qualities!","<div class=""description"">
<p>I got this one as a late Christmas present yesterday. A family member picked it up on sale for 15&euro;. Let&#39;s see whether this set deserves the flak it got upon initial release (mostly because of the price).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box size is the one commonly used for sets that cost between 25 and 30&euro;. The sticker sheet was placed between the instruction&#39;s pages and thus undamaged. The parts come in two numbered plastic bags.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set only contains 157 pieces, but there are a few rare and interesting ones. Among those are four 95188 [6x6 quarter circle pieces]; two 26601; one 6233; one 57906 - all of those in dark blue - and one 6118 wheel in metallic dark grey. I did not own any of these previously, so they&#39;re a welcome addition to my collection.</p>

<p>If you pick up this set just for the parts, I recommend you do so once the price drops to 15&euro; or lower. There are several large parts, but the set as a whole still lacks substance at a price of 20&euro; or more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Mace Windu</strong>: The leader of the Jedi Council has been updated significantly from his last incarnation in 2013. The new head print is more accurate to Sam Jackson than the old one, and the leg and torso prints are improved as well. As expected, he is equipped with a purple-bladed lightsaber. Lego did a good job with this figure.</p>

<p><strong>General Grievous / Qymaen jai Sheelal: </strong>The dreaded cyborg leader of the CIS droid armies has, in contrast to Windu, not been updated at all over his 2013 version. This however is not a big problem in my opinion, as the old pieces work fine, and they&#39;d probably have to create new molds if they wanted the figure to be more faithful to the source material. His collection consists of 4 lightsabers, two green and two blue ones. If you take the time to read the excellent novelization of &quot;Revenge of the Sith&quot; by Matthew Stover, you learn about Grievous&#39; acquisition of his four favourite sabers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not particularly exiting, not particularly difficult. Building models is fun of course, but when rating the &quot;building experience&quot; of a set, I think of impressive or innovative techniques that inspire me to use them in MOCs. In this set, there are none of those. This model took 15 minutes to build. I rarely apply the stickers in a set - only when I know I want to keep the model built and not scavenge it for parts. This model still looks fine to me without them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>While it looks absolutely fine, it is easily three times as big as it should be in relation to the source material. The front part with the steering fins and lances is somewhat wonkey due to the one-barreled technic assembly. I&#39;m afraid that if I drop it from a certain height, something will break. But that could just be my overly careful self. Regarding the play value, it has the <em>swooshability</em>-factor and you can play out fights between the two characters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Although it probably appeared in more than just that one, I only remember this vehicle being in one episode of TCW - Grievous attacks some Jedi initiates who are hiding on a planet where a pirate hideout is located. This is one of several episodes where Grievous is humiliated by an underage Jedi Padawan who should not in any way, shape or form be a match for him. [Please don&#39;t rate this review &quot;unhelpful&quot; just because you love TCW.] What I&#39;m getting at is this: For the price of 30&euro; / 30$, there should be at least 3 figures in here. While I personally am happy that Mace Windu is in this set, fans of the TCW show would probably have been happier with the inclusion of a non-anime-face Ahsoka Tano figure and a pirate (or a Jedi initiate) alongside Grievous.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s conclude with an assessment of the set&#39;s value: For 30&euro; or $, this is a ripoff. Don&#39;t buy it. If you can however get it for 15&euro;, which is the RRP of battlepacks here in Central Europe, I&#39;d definitely recommend it if you like the model, desperately need the figures or like the color dark blue and want some rare pieces for your MOCs.</p>

<p>This is a perfectly average set dragged down by its unreasonable price, which is why I can only give it an overall rating of 2/5 Stars.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Note: I always base the &quot;value for money&quot; points in the &quot;Star Rating&quot; section above on the RRP, not the amount of money I ended up paying when I got it.</p>

"skywalkerfan52","2020-09-09T15:24:09.833Z","Review: 75199 Genral Grievous Combat Speeder","<p>Today&#39;s review is set 75199 General Grievous Combat Speeder that released in 2018. It retails for $29.99, has 157 pieces, includes 2 minifigures, and is from the Clone Wars. This recommended for ages 7+.</p>

<p>Grievous</p>

<p>Grievous has 4 arms that hold 2 blue and two green lightsabers. This is the white version of him, not the tan version. This is the same Grievous we got back then in 2014, so nothing really special about him</p>

<p>Mace Windu</p>

<p>He has front and back torso printing showing his tan robe. There is a brown belt surrounding his waist, and he has leg printing showing the lower part of the robe.</p>

<p>Combat Speeder</p>

<p>Grievous speeder has 2 red blasters under his speeder and there is a place where he can stand to drive the speeder. The front of the speeder looks very good using the royal guard staff Lego use back then in their early years of lego Star Wars. There are 2 big bulk engines in the back to help the speeder go and 2 nice and big side plates used on each side.</p>

<p>Overall review</p>

<p>The speeder is great and all but the minifigures are just horrible! I would recommend Ahsoka Tano and maybe add in the wookie youngling along with General Grievous, then it would be a great set. If you&#39;re a lego Star Wars fan then you can get the set if you like, but if you&#39;re a CLONE WARS FAN then I would NOT recommend this set for you, unless if you like terrible lego Star Wars sets.</p>
