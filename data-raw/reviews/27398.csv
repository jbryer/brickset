<p>Same thing is with this set.It is much better than the 2004 release&nbsp;of&nbsp;4502 x-wing fighter,which was much bigger set.Then we got only hut and not very much playability with it.But now we got bigger and better.Here is something about the set.</p>

<p>FOGGY PLANET OF DAGOBAH</p>

<p>As you all know Luke goes&nbsp;to Dagobah to start his jedi training.There R2 is eaten by swamp monster,Luke meets Yoda and many other&nbsp;importanant&nbsp;things.This set is place where&nbsp; most of this things happens.Yoda hut.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After a long day,you need some drink.And Yoda is prepared for it.Right from enterence&nbsp;you got empty bottle and you can act like it is alcohol (I dont recommed&nbsp;it),water or just juice.Then you can lift up the table and pick up the carrot to cook your supper.Then if you are tired you can rest and fall asleep with the heat of the fire or you can get out and train in&nbsp;jedi&nbsp;way with lifting the rocks,force jumping&nbsp;and saltos.</p>

<p>OVERALL OPINION</p>

<p>If you want to buy it,dont&nbsp;wait.This is best lego set ever.Exelent printed minifigures,tones of playability and good price.</p>

"vikings","2020-06-10T05:37:37.187Z","Yoda's Hut","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a medium size box. The dimensions of the box are 10.3 x 7.5 x 2.4 inches and weighs 0.84 pounds. You get a small/medium size instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some really great parts in this set. You get a red snake, dark grey crate, two tan cockpits used on the door, two dark green sea grass, three grass tubes, two clear rings, a silver frying pan, a carrot, dark grey silver pot, a clear bottle, a clear pole, and a dark grey triple hook&nbsp;that holds the pot. The different color green, brown, and tan parts are really nice and really clash well together creating that Dagobah look and feel. The total piece count for the set is 229. Overall a really nice piece haul from this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p>All of these figures are exclusive to this set and don&#39;t appear in any other set. All of them represent themselves as they are portrayed when they are on Dagobah.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Yoda:</strong></p>

<p>You get Hermit Yoda in this set. He has a rubber head with his pointy green ears. He has a slight smile on his face which looks really nice. On the back of the head you have printing of grey hair which was a nice addition. He has printing on both sides of his torso. On&nbsp;the front you have a collar showing a brown shirt under the piece of clothing. You have&nbsp;something hanging around his neck and there are three pipes stuck together on it (I don&#39;t what it is but it looks nice). He has a brown belt with a little pocket of some sort on it as well. On the back you have the brown belt and some printing of wrinkles showing the shirt. He has short tan legs and a small brown stick.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>R2-D2:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I was very happy getting this version of R2. It was nice getting an R2-D2 figure that isn&#39;t like all the others. This one has a brick dome with his dark silver and blue printing on it. There are a lot of dirt spots all around it. He has his two white astromech legs. The main body has all the usually printing on it like: the&nbsp;three blue arms, white compartments, and a lot of mud on him. I love all the mud on him and this really makes a distinct version of R2.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Luke Skywalker:</strong></p>

<p>I was very happy to get Luke in his Dagobah form.&nbsp;He has his classic tan hair and has a double-sided head. On one side he has a frustrated (not quite angry) facial expression and on the other side he has his eyes closed as he is focused on lifting the dark grey crate. He has clear back plate with a 1x2 light grey angular plate where Yoda goes to ride on his back. He has printing on both sides of his torso of his tan tank top. He has dark tan legs with a pocket on each leg. He has his blue lightsaber as his weapon and for his training.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The build was fairly easy and a lot of fun. The build was a little bit of an adventure not knowing exactly what you are building at the time, but later on realizing what it is. The techniques for the window and door are great and the door really captures the iconic look of&nbsp;the hut. The build took me between 30-40 minutes. Overall a fun build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great set (Not for $30 USD), but is a must-have for any Star Wars fan. The figures are amazing and are great to get them in their&nbsp;Dagobah versions. The build itself really captures that Dagobah feel. The inside is really nice. You have a fold up bed for Yoda to sleep on, a small 2x2 table and a nice fire pit where you can hang the pot over an open flame. My only problem is that the pot with the handle doesn&#39;t really stay on the hooks. You have some nice play features with this set. You have a catapult like thing to launch Luke (although he has a hard time staying in it), a rope hanging from the tree with a clear ring for him to swing on and another on the ground, and a clear pole to put the box on to have Luke use the force to life it up. You also on the top of the tree have a feature that launches Luke off when holding the rope. Both of the green sides and come out from behind the hut and to the side of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 2x2 white plate circles really add a great look to having smoke coming out of the hut. I highly recommend this to any Star Wars fan and to add to your Lego collection in general. I do recommend getting this set on a discount if possible. All I will say is you will not be disappointed with your purchase. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"jakeypoos87","2018-08-07T09:09:26.757Z","Yoda's Hut review","<p>Set 75208 Yoda&#39;s Hut from Star wars Episode V : The Empire strikes back retails for &pound;26 and has 229 parts and also includes 3 mini figures of Yoda, Luke Skywalker and R2-D2.</p>

<p>THE BUILD:</p>

<p>the build of the set is a small representation of Yoda&#39;s&nbsp;Hut on Dagoba. The build has many different play features so you can recreate scenes from the movie,&nbsp;with a rope that you can swing Luke on , a part on the side where you can hang him upside down and a feature at the back of the set where you can make him jump. The build also has a very well detailed interior that includes a flip up bed for Yoda, a cooking area and secret compartment. The set can also be put into different configurations by moving the parts of the hut at the back pf the build to front which makes it more access able for display.&nbsp; the set also looks very good from the outside with some great little details like the window on the side and floating crate.</p>

<p>MINI FIGS:</p>

<p>The mini figures&nbsp;of the set are a great selection with Yoda who has a new torso print along with a molded head and he is great to get in a small set. The other mini figure is Luke in his Jedi training Dagoba&nbsp;outfit and he has brand new printing for his legs and torso along with a two sided head with exclusive expressions. He also ha a new recolor&nbsp;of his original har piece. Luke is also equipped with his light saber and a back piece&nbsp;so he can carry Yoda. The last figure is of R2-D2&nbsp;that has some awesome exclusive muddy printing.</p>

<p>OVERALL:</p>

<p>Overall this is a very nice little set that i would recommend&nbsp;getting for the great figs and so you can recreate the scenes form the movie. However I do think that the set is a bit overpriced for the amount of parts and how much stuff you get so i would recommend getting this set at a cheaper price but besides that i think this set is great for both play and display.&nbsp;</p>
