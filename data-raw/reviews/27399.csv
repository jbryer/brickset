"xboxtravis7992","2018-06-06T17:11:08.5Z","Attack of... some Clones","<p>It is battlepack season again! Two Star Wars battlepack&#39;s came out this summer to compliment the two released earlier this year. The Imperial battlepack themed on Solo has gained considerable praise from the fan base for including a speeder bike seen in the film. How does its counterpart from the Grand Army of the Republic stack up in comparison?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Figures</strong></p>

<p>Battlepack&#39;s&nbsp;just barely started to include named figures last year, with a Bounty Hunter pack which included 4-LOM, Dengar, IG-88, and Boskk. This pack continues that trend with two characters from the films.<br />
<br />
<em>Ki-Adi-Mundi&nbsp;</em>Ah yes, the rising star of the &quot;<a href=""http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/023/107/droid.jpg"">what about the droid attack on the wookies</a>?&quot; memes is re-released in Lego with new prints. Ki-Adi was one of my favorite background characters in the prequels as a kid, and with Yoda and Mace Windu currently in other sets available on the market it is easy now to obtain the three elder leaders of the Jedi Council this year. I love the head mold which was used in previous versions of the figure, but makes a reappearance here.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Barris Offee</em>&nbsp;Barris is probably best remembered for her role in the final televised arc of the beloved&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars&nbsp;</em>series, where she betrays the Jedi Order due to her growing concerns over The Clone Wars. Barris&nbsp;makes use of the new skirt piece, which comes in a plain black color here. Her doublesided head is an angry face on one side and a somewhat dour expression on the other, perhaps hinting to her ultimate fall to darkness. She comes with a cloth cape.<br />
<br />
<em>Clone Troopers</em>&nbsp;It has been a long time since I got a new Phase One clone trooper. While the helmet molds on these two figures are the same as the ones released over ten years ago, the printing was tweaked a few years back to make them more accurate to the angular designs seen on film. They are cool additions to my clone army, and I really like how sleek they look.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>People don&#39;t buy battlepacks for the build they say... Unfortunately this year has offered some decent builds in all the other battlepacks, the mini-sandcrawler in the Jawa&nbsp;pack, the mobile turret with the First Order Specialists, and of course the film accurate speeder bike which the Empire raced into battle with in the <em>Solo</em> pack. This build, is the weakest of the four released this year. The colors are nice, a good tribute to the LAAT/i&nbsp;Gunship. But... it just doesn&#39;t feel fun to hold in a hand or swoosh, and any figure in the speeder looks a little cramped. I do feel a better model for the set could have been a small forward command post, since all the characters in the set were present in the First Battle of Geonosis were the command post was a familiar sight during the battle scene. Or maybe some brick built droid such as a Dwarf Spider for the troops to fight against.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As it is though, this little speeder we got just doesn&#39;t feel that fun to play with. At least its small, and easy to shove into the back of a Star Wars display.<br />
<br />
<strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>As previously expressed, I feel the build was a let down. But what about the figures? I personally thought all four of the figures in the set are great! Especially the updated Jedi! However... this is a downside to a lot of buyers... I have personally never bought a battlepack more than once, so I have no fear of getting duplicate figures from a second of third purchase. However, FOLs looking to build up an army of these new clone troopers will be frustrated buying multiple packs and getting multiple copies of Ki-Adi and Barris... So if you are like me, and just buy one copy of these packs this won&#39;t be an issue, but for an army builder the balance of figures in this pack is not ideal. Frankly, the other three packs released this year all do a better job of army building, with the Jawa and Imperial packs in particular offering up plenty of cool figures.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As such, I feel this is a true middle of the road set. Not great, but it does a few things right to warrant its purchase still. Get it if you are a fan of the Prequel Trilogy and Clone Wars series and want to add some Jedi and Clones to the collection. If not, I would recommend instead going to buy the spectacular Imperial pack or the OT inspired Jawa pack; and skip this one.&nbsp;<br />

"vikings","2020-05-29T05:07:27.363Z","Great Figures, Poor Build","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a small box. The dimensions of the box is 7.5 x 5.6 x 1.8 inches and weighs 0.29 pounds. You get a small/medium instructions booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get a few decent pieces in this set. You get&nbsp;some maroon pieces which are nice to get,&nbsp;one trans blue dish, a few black studs with a hole, and a 2x5x2 glass piece. Overall not bad pieces for a battle pack. The total piece count for the set is 102.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ki-Adi-Mundi:</strong></p>

<p>This is my favorite figure in this set. He has his extra head piece which is really cool with white hair and black band on it. His head is really good with printing on both sides of it. The printing and detail on his face is great at showing his white facial hair. He has great detail on the front and back of his torso. His Jedi robes look great with layers and belt. There is also printing on his legs that is an extension of his robes from his torso. He is armed with his blue lightsaber.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Barriss Offee:</strong></p>

<p>Barriss is another good figure to get in this set. She has her dark blue hood and a double-sided head. On one side she has a normal facial expression with her blue dots on her face. On the other side she has an angry expression. She comes with a soft dark blue cape (which I really like). She has printing on her Jedi robes and a belt on the front and back of her torso. She has the newer dress leg piece. It is black with no printing on it. She comes with her blue lightsaber.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Phase I Clone Trooper:</b></p>

<p>You get two phase I Clone Troopers in this battle pack. The Clone Troopers come with their normal phase I helmet and torso. They have the normal Clone Trooper head. They have new printing on their legs which I love. They don&#39;t usually have printing there and it was nice to finally get some. The printing on them does a great job of showing the armor on them. They are armed with stud shooters with blue studs (Which I hate). I would have loved for them to been given a traditional blaster or rifle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall these are great figures to get in a set (not necessarily&nbsp;a battle pack besides the clone troopers).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:</b></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. Took me less than 10 minutes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:</b></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice set (not battle pack). The figures are amazing to get. Getting updated versions of Barriss Offee and Ki-Adi-Mundi is nice. The phase I Clone Troopers are nice to get (especially getting the printing on their legs). The build itself is ok. I haven&#39;t seen this ship before this set. It isn&#39;t a great design with the big wings and exposed cockpit. The ship has some decent weaponry with two stud shooters at the front of the cockpit and another two brick built cannons on the wings. You can adjust the wings of the ship up and a little bit down. Overall a decent ship.&nbsp; This isn&#39;t a great battle because you can&#39;t buy multiple of these due to getting Ki-Adi-Mundi and Barriss Offee (I mean you can, but you get two named Jedi which you can&#39;t build an army with). Overall this is a decent set (Again not battle pack) and the figures are really good (only thing giving it a high rating). I do recommend this set to any Lego Star Wars fan (mainly for the minifigures). Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-11-30T20:46:15.87Z","Not a bad set but a pretty bad battlepack","<p>&nbsp;The set would not be a terrible set if they made it bigger, threw in another clone, and made the price $20. This is not a set though, it is a battle pack. You are supposed to grow your army but nobody wants an army of named Jedi. The clones are good but there needs to be more of them. The build is suppossed to be a miniturized gunship and for what the costraints were for the designer I think that they did a good job with the build they came up with. The Jedi are not bad and they have nice prints, accessories, and molds, but you don&#39;t want more than maybe 2 of each. I would recommend buying 2 or maybe 3 of this set, taking the clones for your clone army, putting one pair of Jedi in a sealed bag, and giving another pair to a younger relative or something like that. Besides you can always just sell the Jedi mini figures that you don&#39;t want.</p>

",TRUE,3,3,3,5,2
"0neTrick","2020-06-09T03:50:41.893Z","Pretty good $15 set","<p>Overall the set is surprisingly good for its value. You get a good selection of minifigures and a pretty nice republic gunship inspired build. Though the name &ldquo;battle pack&rdquo; really throws people off, it&#39;s the closest thing we have to an updated phase 1 clone trooper battle pack. There&#39;s standard playability in the set with the 2 stud shooters and there&#39;s nothing really special about the build. I think this set is best to have only one copy of. The exclusive updated Jedi are nice and the clone troopers are a welcome addition. Despite it&#39;s one big flaw as being marketed as a &quot;battle pack&quot;, it does pretty well as a small set.</p>
