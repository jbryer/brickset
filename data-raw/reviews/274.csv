"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-06T10:28:04Z","^_^ ☻☺☻☺☻"," This set is so good! I got this set to make a lab for my lego city and it is great! There are 3 double-sided heads belonging to a man, a woman and a mad scientist. There is also a cool Frankinstein's Monster and a ghost. The experiment table is really good and can go up and down and there is also a big laser and a generator for it. One of the best parts of the set is where you put the man into the door, close it and then turn the skull and he comes out as a skeleton! I am not one for using stickers, but in this set, once you have put the stickers onto all the equipment and walls it really makes it look like a realistic, scary labsout of old horror films. The mad scientist and the frankinstiens monster are really good.

 Pros: Mad scientist with transforming head
       Frankinstien's Monster
       Big laser (It's ALIVE! Hahahahaha!)
       Operating table
       Lego's first truly good use of stickers.

 Cons: Laser isnt properly attached, so falls of easily.

  In general this is one of my favourite lego sets and a great addition to any lego town.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-16T10:09:03Z","Mary Shelley's Frankenstein","This set is great!!! It's a bit expensive, but it is real great. The mad scientist who can play for Doctor Frankenstein can also turn his head and become Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde (I know my Classics).
The monster is also great. The ghost is very nice, It hasn't been seen for 10 years in a lego set. The normal figs are nice the building is very nice with the great opening fence and the 2 towers. Only the Laserbeam building is a bit instable. I find it only a pity that you must put stickers on the walls, On Hagids Hut (first version) were the stones already printed.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-16T20:16:32Z","Awesome set!","All of you who didn't but this set because it looks to juniorized missed out on possbly one of the best sets of the 2000 era.  The front of the set (rarely shown in advertisements) has a really cool turn of the century run down castle manor look.  I agree with Psyren that the stickers are a nice addition as well.  And holy cow! Is that frankenstein minifigure not cool or what! 
Without doubt the best scary monster studio set (and one hundred time better that Darcula's crypt).  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>I got this set when it first came out, and it was originally the centerpiece for what is now my expanded Haunted Village (which has basically become a medieval village with the haunted portion at the center).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set has a bunch of nice minifigs (one of the most appealing aspects&nbsp;of a set for&nbsp;me), including the Monster and Mad Scientist figs (now redone in Series 4 of the Collectible Minifigures), plus male and female villagers, a ghost, and an always useful skeleton.&nbsp; It also has several critters, a pumpkin minifig head, and a brain, along with several other useful parts.&nbsp; There are plenty of great play features in the set, and as a fan of both Halloween and Castle, I love this set.&nbsp; It's simply fantastic!</p></DIV>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-18T11:23:24.023Z","LEGO Studios - Scary Laboratory Review","This is a really fun set which also has some rare minifigs. We get lot's of cool stuff like a mirror, a helmet and a cloak which glows in the dark. This set also has a gate which opens, a lever which is going to activate the big lab. I really like the big platform which has a lever which moves the platforms up and down. In the middle of the two towers is a big laser cannon which sviwels. The left tower has some nice tools, a treasure chest and a seat which you can sviwel as well. Behind the seat you can see a big antenna which has lot's of translucent yellow pieces.<br><br>The other tower has a big door which you can open. On the top of the building you can see a container with a skull in it. This container can be sviweled full 360° and you can see the platform behind the door moving. This is the feature you can use to transform the gent who looks like James Bond into a skeleton. If you move the container you can also see a moving translucent purple plate and on the top where you can see the container is also a place to store a brain. This set also has some stickers and I can't complain about the number of minifigs: We get the gent, a lady, a skeleton, a mad scientist and a frankenstein monster. It's a really fun set to have.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
