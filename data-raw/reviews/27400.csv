Harley Quinn:</b> Batman is a huge staple in DC sets, and he&rsquo;s been featured three times once fighting Catwoman, again dealing with Killer Moth and in this third outing his tangling with Harley Quinn. This is definitely a set worth tracking down for Harley fans.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Batman: This short legged Dark Knight is dressed in his black costume which makes this version unique. He includes a short black cape, an interesting facial expression where he&rsquo;s smiling and a simple looking torso print with his iconic logo. He gets to hold a small grapple piece as an accessory.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Harley Quinn: Holding a super-sized brick built hammer Harley is ready to smash her nemesis the Bat. Her face is sassy, she&rsquo;s sticking out her tongue at Batman. The torso print is simplistic with the red and blue design and a red diamond clasp on her belt she&rsquo;s a great looking Minifigure and definitely really fun.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The Mighty Micros</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Much like the regular sized Batman, this Mighty Micro version not only has different costumes, but also has different vehicles. The third Mighty Micro resembles a simplified version of the Batwing from Tim Burton&rsquo;s film with two grey lightsaber hilts attached for laser cannons. The fact that it&rsquo;s on wheels&hellip; well I suppose it can take-off whenever it needs to if you really want to.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Harley&rsquo;s vehicle is a wind-up key car, possibly a bumper car design. It&rsquo;s built in her red and blue mismatched colouring scheme and rolls along brilliantly. The little design is one of the stands out from this line and is one of my favorites.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">If you&rsquo;re a fan of Harley Quinn and want to own all of the different variants of her character you&rsquo;ll need to track down this set. It&rsquo;s a great bit of fun in the box. I feel the builds may be a bit lacking for hard core builders, but for folks who just want to make simple and fun models to play with quickly this is definitely the set for you. Highly recommended.</p>
