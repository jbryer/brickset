The Joker:</b> Batman&rsquo;s arch nemesis is up against the first Boy Wonder in his alternate guise of Nightwing in this Mighty Micros set and features some fun little vehicle builds to join in the Mighty Micros Race Rivalry.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Nightwing: Dressed in his black with blue emblem costume, the short-legged Nightwing has his two escrema sticks and a facial expression that looks like he&rsquo;s really enjoying himself. Big smiles and wide eyes of joy. Nightwing is cute, fun and all around awesome.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Joker: The least menacing version of the notorious Clown Prince of Crime. The Joker is dressed in his purple outfit with the large green bow tie. He has a very happy smile and is using a hair piece which is reminiscent of The LEGO Batman Movie version, in fact it may be the same one though I&rsquo;m not entirely sure of that as the sculpt may be slightly different in the back&hellip; It&rsquo;s actually kind of hard to tell honestly. He&rsquo;s carrying a lime green popsicle, probably made with toxins like smilex gass.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The Mighty Micros</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Nightwing is typically shown riding a motorcycle in his appearances in the comics. This vehicle is a car, but it shares the overall colour scheme of black and dark blue with the motorcycle and his emblem, it&rsquo;s the most ordinary car type build out of the lot so far without any silly or goofy add-ons to make it look cartoonish.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Joker on the other hand is driving around in a stylish little chibi ice cream truck complete with a novelty sign attached to the top of the back made with an ordinary ice cream cone element and some swirly toppings. On the front of the vehicle is a printed element with Joker&rsquo;s patented smile, as he&rsquo;s noted in the past, he loves to put his smile on everything. It&rsquo;s a fantastic build and very fun to play with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is one of the best looking sets yet and I can&rsquo;t recommend it enough, both characters and their little vehicles make for some excellent pick-up and play models and while they aren&rsquo;t as detailed as larger sets you can have a lot of fun with every Mighty Micros set. I&rsquo;m just sorry I skipped these in 2016 when they first started as I&rsquo;m still missing at least four or five sets from each Theme of the Super Heroes line. Definitely recommended.</p>
