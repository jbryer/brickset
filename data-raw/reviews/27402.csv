<p>This set is your casual mighty micro (RIP) set except there is something in this set that I wish to make more people aware of .</p>

<p>The Minifigures-</p>

<p>minifigures are as expected exceptionally cartoony braniac is actually surprisingly normal if you put a pair of normal legs on him and he would look normal . Supergirl&nbsp;is wear my terrors come from the legs , torso , cape and hair are all fine but THE FACE is terrifying . The Accessorys include a working magnifying glass and an item that DC fans like my self will deeply enjoy it has kandor in its bottle this is fantastic I hope Lego do more small references like this in future .</p>

<p>The builds-</p>

<p>Supergirls car has three yellow wings one the back , two trans orange cones for thrust and a very nice printed slope on the front . Braniacs vehicle is a miniaturized version of his iconic skull ship the trans pink dishes for thrust , dome windshield and printed slope make for great detail .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a 75% good set just the Supergirl....oh that .....face it haunts me definitely my least favorite owned minifigure though if you can get past that then this is good set to get .</p>

Brainiac:</b> In order to save Kandor from destruction Supergirl must race against Brainiac in a Mighty Micros showdown beyond anything she&rsquo;s ever faced before. Which means we get more fun and quirky looking little vehicles to play with in this final set from DC which I&rsquo;ve gotten so far.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Brainiac: This short-legged Minifigure features a similar print design to the one found in the regular Brainiac Attack set, the difference being his facial expression and that his torso is slightly simpler in design. I&rsquo;ve used this term quite frequently when discussing these sets, I don&rsquo;t mean that the print is less than what you&rsquo;d expect from this type of Minifigure, just that there are less tech details compared to the one found in the original set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Supergirl: This version of Supergirl really looks like a girl, with short red legs, which kind of make her look a little off. A dual-molded pair might have fit her colour scheme better. Her torso and short cape, plus the large infectious smile she&rsquo;s got on her face and the short blonde hair she&rsquo;s the perfect size for a younger Kara Zor-El. Her accessory is a magnifying glass to help her find Kandor which is a printed cylinder piece Brainiac comes with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The Mighty Micros</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Brainiac&rsquo;s Mighty Micro is a cute little miniature version of his saucer vehicle. This one doesn&rsquo;t include any eyes on it, but the nose and mouth of the skull motif is printed on an element. It has a nice little bubble cockpit that can open and close, which is a really impressive bit of design for such a small set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Supergirl&rsquo;s vehicle is a flying craft with wheels, naturally, and it includes three sweeping tailfin parts with a printed gauge 1x2 sloped element. It isn&rsquo;t exactly the same as the vehicle Superman had, but the design aesthetics work and you could definitely see them being made on the same planet. Overall some fun little vehicles to build and play with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Well, if you&rsquo;re looking for some unique prints, especially the cylinder with Kandor on it, you&rsquo;re going to want this set. It&rsquo;s one of the best offerings from this sub-theme of sets in the DC Super Heroes line. These two Mighty Micros are some of the best and I&rsquo;m really impressed with this one. Strongly recommended.</p>
