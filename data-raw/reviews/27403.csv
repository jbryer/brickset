Nebula:</b> Here we come to the final Mighty Micros set to review which I picked up and I picked up this set because for fans of Guardians of the Galaxy it is a must have set. Why? I hear you ask, well let&rsquo;s dive right in and reveal the answer to that question with the discussion of the Minifigures.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Nebula: Here we have the villain of the piece, although Nebula is more of an Anti-Hero in certain universes. Her short-legged Minifigure is a lot more comic based and less detailed compared to her MCU version. She has less tech detailing on her face and a very minimalistic torso print. She doesn&rsquo;t include any weapons because the accessory she has is a 1x2 printed tile of an audio cassette. Yep, though there is no writing on it this could be Awesome Mix Tape 1.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Star-Lord: This version of Star-Lord has a printed face mask on his head instead of the unique helmet/hair combination that the larger figure has. The other side has a very Star-Lord looking facial print with a smarmy looking smile and quirked brow. His torso has a simpler uniform design for him compared to the larger legged versions, but is still clearly a Guardian of the Galaxy uniform.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The Mighty Micros</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Nebula&rsquo;s Mighty Micro is a space craft which has angled wings in a rather small scale which I believe is meant to resemble the Sakaaran vessels found in the larger Guardians sets from the first movie. The colour scheme of black and red definitely matches the same design as those figures.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Star-Lord&rsquo;s Mighty Micro is a miniature version of the Milano. This little space-craft on wheels looks exactly like the larger model of the Milano spacecraft. It has a tiny little steering wheel as well so it&rsquo;s a very fun model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a must own set for the printed tile piece alone. If you want a cassette to give to Star-Lord in the regular sets you&rsquo;ll need this part and the overall builds and Minifigures included in this set make it extremely worth owning. You can have loads of fun racing with the two vehicles and the short-legged versions of Star-Lord and Nebula are some of the best from this sub-theme. Highly recommended.</p>
