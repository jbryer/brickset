LEGO did away with Mighty Micros as part of the Super Heroes Theme and I, sadly, did not manage to get every set available at the time. So I was surprised to discover this set still available from Canadian Tire a few months ago. Yes, I&rsquo;m in a bit of a backlog for typing reviews. Been working full time for six months, which affects when I can build and type reviews. Anyway, you didn&rsquo;t come to hear about my life, but the LEGO product.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Loki: Short Legged Loki is super cute, but also dressed in a more comic appropriate costume for his torso print. The traditional ruffled neck deal and gold and green jumpsuit he sports in the comics is printed on his front and back which adds to the mischievous child look this Minifigure is going for. He includes the gold helmet, a very cheeky looking facial expression with a grin. He carries a gold staff tipped with a clear blue jewel&hellip; is that the Infinity Stone? Hmm, who knows?</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Thor: The Mighty Thor pilots a Mighty Micro, and this short-legged Minifigure is, once again, more inspired by his comic appearances. The simpler design on his torso for his traditional costume is printed on the front and back, including his mystical golden belt&hellip; at least I think at some point his belt did something. Er, anyway, he&rsquo;s got his hammer and an open-mouthed expression as if he were shouting at his brother to halt. He wears a short red cape and looks great.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The Mighty Micros</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with most of the Mighty Micros sets the builds are rather inconsequential, these models are designed to be built relatively quickly, taking no less than fifteen minutes at the most for both models and then you can start playing with them and enjoying everything involved with them.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Thor&rsquo;s vehicle is a mish-mash of ideas, with a hot rod style engine on the front and Valkyrie like design in the back with wings and lightning bolts attached to clips. This design also hints a bit at Thor&rsquo;s traditional helmet, an item his LEGO incarnation has yet to wear, which had tiny wings on the side. I kind of would like to at least see LEGO make one version of Comics Thor with the helmet, because that part would be great for any Viking inspired builds or to re-use for the likes of Beta-Ray Bill.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Loki&rsquo;s vehicle in contrast looks awesome, it has twin horns jutting out in the front and shares the gold/green colour scheme of the Trickster God. Both models are awesome and fun and just all around great as toys to be raced with, smashed against like bumper cars or used however a child might be inclined to play.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Mighty Micros sets were a great idea that, I&rsquo;m sad to say, probably did not meet LEGO&rsquo;s expectations. Either that or they had a shelf life of only three years, because these sets lasted for only three years. At this price range most fans of the Super Heroes line probably preferred getting regular Minifigures and models of things they saw in their favorite Marvel Comic, Cartoon or Movie, but honestly these models and sets really offered a lot more play value and fun creativity from LEGO for the range. They also were a cheap way to make a small army of Minifigures from both franchises that could duke it out in a Marvel vs. DC epic showdown.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Honestly I kind of wish LEGO would re-visit this idea, perhaps they can, if nothing else we&rsquo;ve seen inventive ways to reuse the Mighty Micro vehicle chassis this year. I would Recommend this set if you enjoy playing and experiencing fun builds with your LEGOs. If you prefer to display and collect regular sized Super Hero Minfigures, these sets probably wouldn&rsquo;t appeal to you. Overall Recommended.</p>
