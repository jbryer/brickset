Sandman:</b> Peter Parker&rsquo;s clone gets his own Mighty Micro and he&rsquo;s up against the villainous Sandman. This is one of the last sets from this sub-theme of Super Heroes as we have not seen any Mighty Micros for 2019. And it&rsquo;s a very impressive set, let&rsquo;s discuss why that is before covering the final thoughts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Sandman: The villain of the set is a short-legged version of Sandman with Mighty Micros typical details of over-exaggerated expressions. He&rsquo;s got a huge wide open-mouthed smile with a tooth missing and part of his torso has some sand detailing. One arm is also using a sand colour to show Sandman partially changing from his human form to a larger monstrous sand form, the buildable accessory looks like he&rsquo;s got his hand morphed into a hammer to attach Spidey with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Scarlet Spider: Wearing a hoody is part of Scarlet Spider&rsquo;s uniform in certain eras of the comics and this short-legged Minifigure has detailing on the front and back to indicate the outfit. He also has a large black spider logo, but it isn&rsquo;t on the chest, rather off to the side. His eyes are narrowed and look a little too much like Deadpool honestly, also he&rsquo;s carrying a shovel, I guess when dealing with Sandman it&rsquo;s important to have the proper tools.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The Mighty Micros</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Sandman&rsquo;s vehicle is obviously meant to evoke a dump truck. In the back it has a lot of sand coloured bricks showing that he&rsquo;s got some extra material to attack with. The front is very fun looking in design too with a large steering wheel piece from LEGO Technic instead of the regular System steering wheel. It&rsquo;s a great looking little vehicle and fits the character perfectly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Scarlet Spider seems to be driving a Spider-Man inspired jet of some kind as a Mighty Micro. It has three jet engines in the back and large tailfins on the back. Spider-Man having a vehicle never really made much sense to me, considering he&rsquo;s always had money troubles, but maybe his buddy Iron Man lent him the vehicle. Either way it&rsquo;s a quirk designed build that works as a foil for Sandman&rsquo;s dump truck.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a great fun little set and offers up two great vehicles to build and play with. The Minifigures are very well done too and Mighty Micros makes a pretty good set for fans to just build and play and let their imaginations run wild. So I&rsquo;d recommend this to folks who are interested in such sets.</p>
