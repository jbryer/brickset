All joking aside, this set is an awesome Infinity War tie-in and a great looking BrickHeadz model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Behold the Mad Titan, this packaging shows exactly what you&rsquo;re going to be getting in this set and I love it. The imagery on the side of MCU Thanos looks great too. Overall an awesome box design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The instructions unfortunately are always going to be folded and so make it very difficult to keep the manual open while working on the build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It&rsquo;s Parts Pack discussing time, loads of large headlight bricks, a lot of light purple plates and tiles and some nice printed Thanos inspired bricks and tiles, or brick and tile if you&rsquo;d prefer to be accurate.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This BrickHeadz is built the same as most others, but the hands are completely different from most other BrickHeadz models. In order to make the Infinity Gauntlet on Thanos&rsquo; hand, they actually built up the hands in a different way. Using hinged brick pieces with hinge plates and the rest of the hands featuring more plates to bulk them out, Thanos actually features a solid looking fist design and has some motion in the limbs.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Thanos is inevitable in all forms, be it Minifigure, Big Fig or Brick-Built character and this BrickHeadz works really well to capture the look of Infinity War Thanos. Overall this model is very solid and the printed detailing works great to show his gauntlet and his armor. Definitely a fun little model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Even if you aren&rsquo;t a fan of BrickHeadz I think Thanos is one of the must own characters from the Theme. I&rsquo;d recommend this set to everybody, parts hunters, collectors, casual builders. Thanos is just all around a solid looking model and his unique hand builds means that he is one of the only BrickHeadz with fully constructed hands compared to most BrickHeadz use of simple plates and tiles to make the arms/hands of the model. Highly Recommended.</p>
