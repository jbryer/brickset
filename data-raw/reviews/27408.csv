<p>I haven&#39;t played with Legos since I was a kid, and I had so much fun putting this figure together.&nbsp; The color of the pieces did give me a bit of trouble, lots of brown, tans, beige parts got a little confusing especially since I didn&#39;t have super great light where I was assembling.&nbsp; Other than the brick color palette and the fact that I&#39;m pretty sure I was missing 1 piece and had 4-5 extra random pieces, I thoroughly enjoyed this set and am proudly displaying in my living room.</p>

<p>Note:&nbsp; I was able to fudge the figure without the missing piece but the back part of one of Starlord&#39;s boot is a tan hair block instead of a brown brick like it should be.&nbsp; The pack was on sale at my Hobby Store so I&#39;m wondering if he got it cheap as like a second-hand/abnormal discount sort of thing.</p>

<p>Still great, great fun!&nbsp; Also, I&#39;m totally hooked.</p>
