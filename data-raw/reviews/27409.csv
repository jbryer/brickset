Personally, I was not a fan of the wave in general she was part of. Of course, of all of them, she turns out the hardest Brickhead to find. But, eventually, I was able to include her into a larger order at online Lego shop.</p>

<p>Gamora, in the end, she was a fun, 20 minute build. Even more so, compared to some of the other Brickheadz&nbsp;I have built, there were a few oddities in its construction. For one, the core structure was not soleley the 2x1x2&nbsp;4 studs on side one is used to. There were two brown 1x1x2&nbsp;2 studs on the side included. Second, there is the construction of the&nbsp;most striking part - and the one that appealed to me the most: the hair (colouring) of Gamora.&nbsp;The construction of her hair-do was most fun of he whole build. Additionally, there are quite a few spare pieces in black and pink.</p>

<p>Overall, Gamora&nbsp;is like many Brickheadz, a figure you like or dislike based on looks alone. Therefore, as with any Brickheadz, it is hard to recommend, IMHO. That said, IMHO, it is one of the more striking figures, and well worth the cost.</p>

Previously we saw Captain America, Iron Man, Black Widow and The Hulk, with the figures inspired by Infinity War we see Thanos, Iron Man Mk 50, Star-Lord and Gamora. Overall a decent selection of characters between the two full non-exclusive waves inspired by the MCU.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Gamora is shown with her sword on the side of the packaging while the BrickHeadz sits prominently on the front. This second batch of Marvel figures features a space background with a dark blue view of the cosmos.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Instructions are serviceable, unfortunately they come in the box creased/folded which makes it harder to keep open during the build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There&rsquo;s a load of large headlight bricks, light green tiles, a brick with the torso print of the character and maroon and dark pink bricks and plates among other things in this set. Again we leave off by stating that this set is an excellent cheap little parts pack.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The build is pretty similar to other BrickHeadz, a lot of interesting steps and engineering went into making Gamora&rsquo;s hair and duster style jacket. I love how they used two brown NEXO power shields on her back for the jacket.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Gamora looks great in BrickHeadz form, she&rsquo;s holding a katana, which doesn&rsquo;t quite match the look of the weapon she had in the film, but seems to work very well for what it is. Love the way they made her hair, it is just all around really well done and the mixture of dark pink with black just has a very nice flow to it here with the model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As a fan of Marvel characters I&rsquo;d say the BrickHeadz look great and make for an awesome little display. I&rsquo;d recommend picking them up if you are into this aesthetic. If you&rsquo;re not interested in BrickHeadz in general, you can skip this set without missing much. Recommended.</p>
