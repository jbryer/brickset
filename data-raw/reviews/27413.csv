I was not interested in the line as the designs didn&rsquo;t appeal to me. But the justice league wave had a special something to its design. A certain charm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What moved me to&nbsp;buy this is that I like the Flash. And it has many dark red parts. And as it is most of the time with LEGO, the model is better in real life than pics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The coolest detail is the back of the head, where there is a nice sloping shape, which captures the Flash&rsquo;s helmet well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great start to my brickheadz collection. I&rsquo;m still not a fan, but will buy the ones which are outstanding or my favorite characters.</p>
