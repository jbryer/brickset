<p>Hello all, today i&rsquo;ll be having a look at a Wave 2, 2018 Brickheadz character. Wonder Woman has 143 pieces and retails for &pound;9.99 $9.99 but can often be found cheaper. It has a price per part of 7p or 7c.</p>

<p>Wonder Woman is based on her Justice League&nbsp;appearance. Let&rsquo;s look at this Brickheadz&nbsp;character.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>All 143 parts go into the Brickheadz and stand, the stand is just a simple build using 4 tiles (one of which printed with a brickheadz face with &ldquo;Series 2&rdquo; next to him on a 2x4 tile) on a black 6x6 plate.</p>

<p>Wonder Woman&rsquo;s internal build is a simple and common build that is seen in&nbsp;the Brickheadz&nbsp;theme. Her exteriors structure is again similar minus the hair construction. Each of her hands and arms are attached separately on to two 1x2x2 bricks with 4 studs on one side. Her hands are holding a silvery sword in one and a gray shield with a bird printed..</p>

<p>Her torso build is simple with only two printed parts a exclusive 1x4 Dark Red brick with her upper torso printed and a 1x2 Pearl Gold tile with her logo printed attached to a 1x2 dark blue brick with two studs on one side. Her legs just use a few plates each in Tan, Pearl Gold and Dark Red which both attach to the stand.</p>

<p>Wonder Woman&rsquo;s Head is my favourite of the 2nd Wave, her face has stud area of 4x4 with a 1x4 unprinted tan tile then a 1x4 tile with two studs in tan holding her printed eyes then a exclusive 2x4 tan tile with her iconic head band printed on.</p>

<p>Finally her hair is the most detailed i&rsquo;ve seen personally, It&rsquo;s build with multiple types of black bricks, slopes, tiles and plates. The two sides of her hair are built identically but just rotated 180 degrees, the top is nice and smooth with two slope parts.</p>

<p><strong>Interesting Parts</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;For a &pound;10 or $10 set their is a decent amount of interesting parts so i thought i&rsquo;d look all them that interested me</p>

<p>1x1 Quarter&nbsp;round tile, Black Quantity 8 plus extra</p>

<p>All 5 printed tiles and printed 1x4 brick plus printed Shield</p>

<p>1x1 plates, Pearl Gold, Quantity 8 plus extra</p>

<p>______________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Well let me conclude a positive review with more positives, There are many great parts in this set but what those parts go into male this set better as the build is well built and detailed very well.</p>

<p>Now if i&rsquo;d reviewed this at the start of the year i would have said go and buy this asap but reviewing it now in Sept 2018 i&rsquo;d say if you want a good brickheadz character go for Micky or/and Minnie Mouse cause there just better than this character but that my opinion. Also if your a child or buying for a child think would they want a display model like this or something playable like a Star Wars Microfighter or Marvel/ DC Mighty Micro.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Great PPP, Great value, Nice parts for MOC&rsquo;s,&nbsp;Well detailed build throughout</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>There are better Brickheadz available that push this one to the back of people&rsquo;s minds, As like all the other brickheadz it&rsquo;s not very playable</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
