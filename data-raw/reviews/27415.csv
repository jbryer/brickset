<p>When the first images of the new Ninjago <em>Spinjitzu Masters </em>line got revealed, I already knew I had to get one. These sets are designed just for play and don&#39;t really have any display value, but there&#39;s still some things that make it a worthwhile addition to any collection.</p>

<p>First - the minifig. This set has only one minifig, an exclusive Spinjitzu Nya variant. While the upper hood piece was used last year in many Ninjago Movie sets, the lower part is new in gunmetal grey and appears in only one other set - the more expesive 70641. The double-sided face print is the same one seen in 70611, 70617, 70618 and 70641, so it&#39;s pretty common. The legs are used in many promotional Ninjago sets, for example the Kendo Jay and Cole training pods. The best part of Nya is definitely her torso, which has some shiny silver printing in the water prints. That looks absolutely splendid. Nya also gets a brick built spear. Overall, this Nya is a really great minifig for a 10 dollar/euro set.</p>

<p>The build is really quick and doesn&#39;t have any very interesting techniques. The handle reminds me a lot of the Airjitzu Flyer handle builds from 2015.</p>

<p>One of the main reasons I got this set was the pieces. While the piece count isn&#39;t really that great (69 pieces for ten euros/dollars) there&#39;s still some really interesting and even rare ones:</p>

<p>- silver shurikens (Ninjago fans have waited these for years, and you get two spare ones too!)</p>

<p>- two transparent light blue 2X2 tiles</p>

<p>- two transparent light blue flames</p>

<p>- a lot (22!) dark azur pieces, including two 1X8 plates (only appeared in two other sets.)</p>

<p>- a printed 2X2 round tile with Nya&#39;s symbol on it</p>

<p>The finished builds (the spinner, handle and shrine) all look great. I think the shrine design of this set is the strongest when compared to the others in <em>Spinjitzu Masters </em>line (the dripping water makes it look unique and interesting.) The dark azur/pearl gold colour combination of the handle looks nice and gives it a striking look.</p>

<p>Then the most important: The playability. Will KFOLs (and some TFOLs and AFOLs too ;D) find amusement from spinning the spinner? The answer is yes. I think the spinning feature works perfectly and there&#39;s a lot of tricks you can try with the spinner (it can be spinned upside down and on its side too!)</p>

<p>Overall, I recommend all Ninjago fans (and why some other Lego fans too!) get one of these spinners. They have cool minifig, some nice parts (especially this one has!) and offer a great play value for kids (and why not for older people too!.)</p>
