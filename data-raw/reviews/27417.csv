<p><strong>THE BUILD:</strong></p>

<p>The build is simple and took me 2-3 minutes to build. The build itself is good&nbsp;and I especially like the side build because of the TWO Ice&nbsp;Aeroblades.</p>

<p><strong>THE PARTS:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The parts are the main reason I bought this. A set of four&nbsp;shurikens finally appear in silver and I like the inclusion&nbsp;of the Aeroblades and trans light blue snowflake are great. There is also a printed 2x2 round tile with a Zanes snowflake symbol.</p>

<p><strong>THE MINIFIGURE:</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The minifigure included is Spinjitzu Master Zane and I think he is mediocre. He is great if&nbsp;you want someone to look like they have been blasted with ice.</p>

<p>OVERALL &amp; PLAYABILITY:</p>

<p>It is very playable and is fun but I recommend having two spinners and two people. Also, it can leave scuff marks and especially on this white spinner.</p>

<p>RECOMMENDATION:&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you collect Zane or want a spinner, I recommend having this. If not then pass on it because it is not worth it.</p>
