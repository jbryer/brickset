<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-d2a0e117-7fff-1ba9-59ff-9ef80e829f09"">Spinjitzu has always been at the heart of Ninjago. The ninja have long practiced this ancient art. Although the old spinners have long been out of distribution, this new take on the classic proves exciting. Even the box transfixes total superiority over past packaging.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-d2a0e117-7fff-1ba9-59ff-9ef80e829f09"">Ripcord capabilities were not present on the original design, but I appreciate the inclusion. When pulling the ripcord out, an immense sense of power can be felt and will excite any kid. The mechanism slots into gear smoothly every time. There are even Technic enhancements at the handle end of the ripcord, providing limitless possibilities for additions.</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-d2a0e117-7fff-1ba9-59ff-9ef80e829f09"">The handle is thoughtfully integrated and I love the polished, stable feel to the base shaft. The combination of curved slopes and studless plates form the perfect fusion. As for the capsule, sleek, aerodynamic components provide the appropriate effect. Its effortless design speaks of unimagined force as the top-like toy rests upon your hand. Launching such a large piece of plastic is overwhelmingly awesome. This vessel could not have been improved at all.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-d2a0e117-7fff-1ba9-59ff-9ef80e829f09"">The minifigure is average in every way that the spinner is breathtaking. Here Kai wears the same upper mask part available for The Lego Ninjago Movie the year before. The lower element is newer, but does not add much. The head underneath is extremely prevalent in the Ninjago range and is the head used for Kai ever since The Lego Ninjago Movie. His outfit emphasizes plain, primary colors and fails to thrill.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-d2a0e117-7fff-1ba9-59ff-9ef80e829f09"">The final object of the set finishes strong. I really savor the sword rack. This small, suitable build is a proper structure for storing the crisply molded blades. Since the Dragon Sword of Fire has appeared frequently in previous sets, you might believe this set deserves a new element. However, the ability of TLG to detail an accessory so well that they can use it years later earns these neat little blades their own place. So, I welcome their incorporation.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-d2a0e117-7fff-1ba9-59ff-9ef80e829f09"">I do not see why anybody would stray from procuring this set. The minor size does not limit it from being a major success. I actually found myself taking it for a spin and trying some tricks.&nbsp; A minifigure collector may wander elsewhere, but most will see the modernity in such an item.</b></p>
