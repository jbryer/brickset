My son is a Batman fan and knows next to nothing about Spider-Man, yet this may be his favorite set. I guess it all comes down to playability. 2 vehicles, a building, a web, a web string, as well as a super hero and crazy looking bad guy. This set just inspires creativity and for some reason the bad guy always wins.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My son is 4 so building anything too large can test his attention span, but each component of this set is small enough that he can build them without asking for any help, or at least he might build two things by himself before asking me to build the rest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But at the end of the day the key to this set is playability and this set cranks the playability up all the way to eleven! That&rsquo;s right, it goes to eleven!</p>
