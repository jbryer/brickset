<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>This set offers quite a lot for its price. Starting off with the Batcave itself, there is a small but quite roomy&nbsp;prison cell to hold the joker in that can be detached from the main structure to create a custom arrangement it has studs on the inside and minifigures can stand attached without falling down. To the right of the structure is a mini terminal for robin, themed in his colors it holds all of the dynamic duo&acute;s weapons. The middle is a batwing launch tower. It has a printed tile that shows a display of the batwing and what appears to be a brightly colored countdown. when the batwing fits down into the tower it turns it into the shape of the bat-symbol. The batwing build itself is what should be expected of a juniors set, funky but playable. It seats just one minifig and has the new disc tile launchers which go much further than flick-fire missiles in my experience. The joker&#39;s car is a bit strange, which I guess I shouldn&#39;t be surprised about considering its owner. Giant flames and very few pieces provide what is&nbsp;needed for a chase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The set provides a very nice array of parts. With a plethora of printed tiles, many holding the bat-logo make it very easy to create authentic-looking bat-MOC&acute;s. The joker car&#39;s white teeth and his hammers target complement it. What I enjoyed most were the tall grey girder pieces that look like they belong in a batcave.</p>

<p>Minifigs</p>

<p>These figures are a great kickoff point for a kid getting into dc but nothing too special if you already own a few sets. The joker appears with dynamite and a new torso print featuring a blue bow tie. His dual expression face just has a happy and slightly less happy printing. Batman is very similar to his previous incarnations, the only difference being a new juniors cape with only one hole to put it on (nice as I always had trouble figuring out capes when I was 8). Robin is a completely new version of the figure, appearing to be a dick grayson or Jason todd robin. He has a new juniors cape as well and comes with a grappling hook though not with the current piece, just a red megaphone and the hook.</p>

<p>Final thoughts</p>

<p>Overall I love this set, I bought it because It felt criminal that I didn&#39;t have a joker yet but was very surprised to find it offered so much value and fun. Though a little under my age range all the pieces and figures are much appreciated for building my own batcave out of the BURP&acute;s it provides and batwing infrastructures. Defintely worth considering for a kid fan of DC super heroes!</p>
