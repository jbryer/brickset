Even the box size! you get great figures, great parts, and a spinner if you don&#39;t want to get the other spinners. The play set is great because it can work as a base or an arena. Getting lloyd to spin in the arena is a hassle sometimes but it works. Overall this is a great price and I think its worth the money.&nbsp;</p>

"adutt17","2018-03-30T09:18:53.6Z","S.O.G Headquarters Review","<p>This set is great, for a set of its price. The inclusion of a Spinjitzu Master is a great thing to get in an $80 set, and the minifigures included aren&#39;t bad either.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>We get 5 minifigures in this set, those being Spinjitzu Lloyd, Ultra Violet, Snake Jaguar, Chopper Maroon, otherwise known as Nails, and Luke Cunningham, otherwise known as Skip Vicious. Spinjitzu Lloyd, Zane as Snake Jaguar and this version of Ultra Violet are all exclusive to this set, so it&#39;s definitely worth the money if you want any of these figures.</p>

<p>The Lair</p>

<p>The Lair itself looks really cool, and has a lot of features to mess around with. Among the most useful involves the lair doors. All you have to do is get the doors to open really fast and a lever system at the top will knock off the Oni mask included in the set, which in this case is the Mask of Hatred.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The motorcycle</p>

<p>The set also includes a small motorcycle for the S.O.G members to use. It is primarily&nbsp;black and purple in color, with red wheels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final thoughts</p>

<p>This set is definitely worth your money if you are a big Season 8 fan. The exclusive minifigures, as well as the inclusion of a spinner, will make it worth your time.&nbsp;</p>

Also the set seems small for the price - at least half of the box volume is air.</p>

<p>The minifigs are very nice, as well as the bike and the spinjitsu.</p>

<p>I think there are better ninjago sets.</p>
