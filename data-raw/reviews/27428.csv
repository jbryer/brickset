The&nbsp;figures you get are amazing and the playability of the set is good and could keep you busy for hours. The bikes roll really well and the figures fit perfectly, except for Zane unless you take his accessories off. The part are really good and you get two heads for Mr.E which is useful. Mr. E&#39;s bike also has really great parts on it. So the price is kind of bad but I think if you got the set it would be worth it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"adutt17","2018-03-30T02:08:15.407Z","Street Race of Snake Jaguar Review","<p>This set is incredible for playability. The set itself is two motorcycles and a street accessory&nbsp;holding the Oni Mask of Vengeance, but it is still fun to play with.</p>

<p>Zane&#39;s bike:</p>

<p>The Titanium Ninja returns, and this time, he has a super cool motorcycle to help him out. The bike itself has a really cool design, with two golden blades and an eagle inspired decorative accessory at the front of the bike. However, it is not just for decoration. Lift up the wings of the eagle, pull up a bit and, viola!, the eagle comes off to help Zane recapture the Oni Mask of Vengeance. When you are done with the eagle, put it back into place and fold the wings back down to lock it into place. The golden blades can be pulled out as well, and, assuming the eagle&#39;s wings are not in the way, can be placed into position at the front of the bike, or anywhere else you want. The eagle also has stud shooters at the end of each of his wings, which can be fired at Mr E&#39;s bike.</p>

<p>Mr E&#39;s bike:</p>

<p>Mr E&#39;s bike has a lot of cool features as well. For example, the two stud shooters can be fired at Zane&#39;s bike. Mr E&#39;s bike also has two blades at the sides. Unlike Zane&#39;s bike, however, these don&#39;t fold out to the sides. Instead, these blades fold out directly to the front, where from then on until you decide to fold them back, something really cool happens everytime you roll the bike forward. The little spikes on the front wheels may seem like they are just there for decoration, but folding the blades on Mr E&#39;s bike forward and then rolling the bike forward will cause the blades to move up and down repeatedly. This feature can be used to attack other vehicles from this line of sets.</p>

<p>Street Accessory</p>

<p>Of course, there has to be something to battle for in this set, and that is where the Oni Mask of Vengeance comes in. The mask itself not only looks cool, but also grants an awesome effect to the wearer. The mask is situated on a Garmadon style body, and maybe that seems like something for it to stay on and nothing more, but you were wrong if you thought that. Taking off Mr E&#39;s armour, head and helmet, then taking off the body from the stand and placing it on what remains on Mr E will turn him into a 4-armed nindroid.</p>

<p>Final thoughts</p>

<p>Overall, this set is great. I would definitely&nbsp;recommend this set for anyone who is a big Ninjago fan</p>

"Genralcowbuster2","2018-04-12T15:15:50.197Z","Not Bad","<p>Honestly, overall the set was not bad. I just seemed&nbsp;a little repetitive to me. in the last season, you got Dessert Lightning, which was a bike for Jay and a Vermillion bike, and back in Skybound&nbsp;with Kai and Nya&#39;s&nbsp;bikes. Overall it was a fun build and very&nbsp;playable. it was definitely&nbsp;worth the price because you are getting some expensive and rare parts.&nbsp;</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-11-20T04:03:13.977Z","Nice play set for a reasonable price","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>This set is a fairly small play set, in some ways almost a smaller version of the set 70642 Killow&nbsp;vs Samurai X. There are quite a few Ninjago bikes already out there, and these fit right in. They also fit in with the general theme of the S.O.G. story. I like the Oni mask and the additional torso. Each bike has a particular play feature - Zane&#39;s bike a detachable drone, Mr. E&#39;s bike the fang like blades. The bikes share some construction elements, but the overall difference is great enough to avoid tedious repetition. Generally, the off-colour&nbsp;parts (like the Technic pins) are also hidden away properly. I like the designs, the bikes feel sturdy and swooshable, the minifigs are good. All in all, a good play set, with an overall acceptable price.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Building the two bikes was quite OK. There are two bags, and building the set took&nbsp;me a little less than an hour. The minimum age is given as 7 years old, and I think that more or less appropriate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first bag contains the little torso+Oni-mask stand, and the parts for Zane&#39;s bike and drone. Having built the core, the bike is dressed up with Zane&#39;s seat, and two large sword pieces to make up the rear. The construction is made of simple Technic bars. The in&nbsp; truly off-colour&nbsp;piece is a red connector, but I am not sure whether there is an alternative. The separately constructed drone pretty much forms the front of the bike. The bike feels slightly springy, but that is because of Technic bars flexing. There are - IMHO - no truly special or techniques used, but it all works out well. There are a few stickers to be applied, but they work well.</p>

<p>The Oni-bike&#39;s chasis is constructed similarly, but still has its completely own character. Rather than a drone attached to it, it has two swooping fang-like blades, not that dissimilar to what the Killow&#39;s&nbsp;chopper has. Again, the while things feels sturdy.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are two minifigures, Zane and Mr. E.</p>

<p>Mr. E is also included in the Temple of Resurrection (set 70643). He has a very detailed and very well done front and back torso print. The front print is nicely continued onto the legs. I like his shoulder armour. His face is basically black with only two haunting white and red rimmed eyes.</p>

<p>Zane is unique. He has a gorgeous and very detailed print on his torso (front and back) and legs. He does not seem to wear armour, but rather a kimono. I like his face print.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Although their frames are basically identical, both bikes have a completely different character.&nbsp; And where Ninjago&nbsp;is notorious for the number of stickers in sets, I think in this set they do add something to the overall look.</p>

<p>Zane&#39;s bike (when the drone is attached to it) has the character of a racing bike. The studshooters are&nbsp;well integrated into the drone (and bike). The few off-colour pieces there are - a red Technic connector and a yellow bar - are decently hidden. I like the disc-cover of the wheel rims, making them look identical on both sides. The drone almost looks like a bird, and is a fun additional play element.</p>

<p>Mr. E&#39;s bike seems to be inspired in Killow&#39;s&nbsp;chopper. He has a clear seat, the two fang-blades, and a colour-scheme&nbsp;similar to that of the Oni-chopper. I like how they have the front wheel rim refer to Killow&#39;s&nbsp;front-blade. I also like the spikes sticking out. I am not sure whether the studshooters have been incorporated properly - it seems that&nbsp;there is a very good chance you will hit the front of the bike, rather than the opponent.</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>This set is clearly a play set. Two very ridable bikes, studshooters, a good guy and a bad guy, something to &#39;fight&#39; over, a drone, a crazy bike. What is there not to like? For display, they are rather small. They could be turned into a nice vignette though.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this is a good play set that would make for a nice gift. Its price is decent, and in some ways it is a smaller alternative for the Killow vs Samurai X set. So if you are into Ninjago, or are looking for a nice play set, this one to consider.</p>

"digi_raptor","2021-03-10T11:05:53.797Z","Nice double bike set","<p>For most, double bike sets have become repetitive and boring, but I quite like this set as both bikes were important to the show and have lots of play features while still looking good. This set comes with Zane&#39;s S.O.G bike which can fit the Zane minifigure with his back accessory. The colours are also nice and I think the translucent blue looks especially good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The features of Zane&#39;s bike are:</p>

<p>-Two golden blades that are connected by a clip, so can move forwards and backwards</p>

<p>-a detaching brick built version of Zane&#39;s falcon</p>

<p>-two stud shooters on Zane&#39;s falcon&#39;s wings</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr E&#39;s bike is the same size as Zane&#39;s bike and has similar features. Mr E&#39;s seating area is well- designed and has the colour theme as all the S.O.G bikes, purple, black and red. It also has a flag featuring the S.O.G symbol with a spike on top</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mr E&#39;s bike&#39;s features are:</p>

<p>- Two stud shooters on either side of the bike</p>

<p>- Spikes on the front wheels which makes the bike look very menacing</p>

<p>- two blades that can swing forwards and backwards via a cog piece. If the blades are left facing forwards, you can roll the bike and the blades will move up and down because of the spikes on the wheels which can make for a really cool looking attack function</p>

<p>The side build is a nice small stand to hold the mask of vengeance and Mr E&#39;s extra arms and two red katana&#39;s.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this is, in my opinion, the best double bike set for Ninjago, great for play or display and the minifigures are great.</p>
