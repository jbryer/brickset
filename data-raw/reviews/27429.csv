<p>A small set in the series of Batvehicles, but definitely in style. A fun and generally easy build, with the only tricky part attaching the side-panels. There are only two stickers, a result of this vehicle not having a name. Captain Boomerang is nice, Batman is to be found in many other sets. IMHO the set is offers decent value for money, though slightly at the higher end of the price per part.</p>

<h2>Building experience</h2>

<p>It was an easy set to build - just two bags, and 80 steps. In total is makes for some 20 minutes of building fun. As mentioned above, there are only two stickers. Unfortunately one of them - the exhaust sticker - seems to be printed out of register; if you put the sticker on centrally, the word &#39;exhaust&#39; will be slightly off center to the left. The one tricky element in the build is where the side panels need to be put on; I had missed that they need to be slipped over the tan pin, and could not get it to fit as a result.&nbsp; IMHO it is a necessary evil (and clever technique used by the designer) to make sure the sidewall stays on. Other clever techniques are used in attaching the wings (and the ugly blue pins are quite well hidden) and in the design of the &#39;canopy&#39; frame. The &#39;spring&#39; mechanism is similar to that used in Joker&#39;s Notorious Low Rider.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are two minifigures included: the ubiquitous Batman, and Captain Boomerang. Batman is nothing special, and is identical or very similar to those found in almost every single set in the Batman Movie Range: cloth cape, utility belt, Batarang and two face prints.</p>

<p>Captain Boomerang is a much more interesting minifigure. Very colourful, white print on blue on the front and back of the torso. This print of&nbsp;mini boomerangs that is continued on the legs. The blue bleeds through a little on the legs, but nothing off putting. More so, the legs are duo-moulded, with the bottom half representing Captain Boomerang wearing black boots. I like his headgear (more of a baret), and his face print (of which there is only one). He is armed with two white boomerangs. Overall, a good minifigure to add to the collection.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The Bat-Dune Buggy is unfortunately name-less, despite it IMHO having quite a bit of character. It is clearly the cousin, if not the little brother of the Batmobile in this series. It is similar in design:&nbsp;big wheels, bulky, aggressive looks, and the red pin striping (done by bricks rather than stickers). The armament consists of two stud shooters. The back wheels do have a working suspension. Batman fits in the vehicle quite well (and is easily put in), though&nbsp; his head sticks out beyond the &#39;roll bars&#39; . IMHO the dune buggy looks good from all angles.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This IMHO is clearly a play set: it is so small it gets lost on its own as a display piece. Dominant dark colours do not help in that regard either. It could work as part of a larger display piece though - say a Batman vehicle line-up. For play it offers quite a bit: two studshooters, working suspension, and simply the fun of racing the buggy around. It is easy to hold, feels (and is)&nbsp;manuoevrable, and just fun to drive around. Captain Boomerang makes for an interesting villain.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall (not looking at price per part) this IMHO is close to being a gem. A fun vehicle, nice build, an interesting minifigure, sturdy and good for play. The one thing I missed though was a&nbsp;name for&nbsp;the vehicle.&nbsp;That said, I feel that the price is a little on the high side; if there had been one extra minifigure, this would IMHO be a super set. In US dollars it offers a good price, for Europe I think it slightly on the pricy side. IMHO it still makes for a decent buy at RRP, but at a discount it IMHO becomes almost a no brainer if you like Lego Batman vehicles.</p>

"Capit√°n_Skrall","2018-12-21T23:33:57.337Z","Great bat vehicle.","<p>The Bat-dune buggy was released during&nbsp;the final&nbsp;wave of the&nbsp;The Lego Batman Movie sets&nbsp;with a piece count of 198 and including two minifigures. The piece inventory does not particularly stand out besides a pair of big rudder parts (28779),&nbsp;a couple of brackets,&nbsp;the big rugged tires (which I can&#39;t get enough of) and&nbsp;two red&nbsp;rubber bands.</p>

<p>A regular version of Batman and&nbsp;a very joyful&nbsp;Captain Boomerang are the included minifigures, both of them are well designed and nicely printed and executed. The&nbsp;Captain has a charming look&nbsp;with the big smile and thick eyebrows, his suit is pretty clean looking and the overall classic aesthetic is pleasant. While this Batman is pretty common I have no complaints about it, as he comes complete with the introduced utility belt and the cloth cape.&nbsp;A&nbsp;fun detail I noticed is the&nbsp;appropriate&nbsp;inclusion of a pair of boomerangs for each character.</p>

<p>The build process was pleasant, I consider this a&nbsp;thoughtful&nbsp;design&nbsp;as it manages to include suspension (the rubber bands are well hidden in the chassis)&nbsp;and a&nbsp;functional opening cage while maintaining a compact size and&nbsp;added details all around the model. It looks authentic as a&nbsp;bat vehicle, with the&nbsp;engine in the back looking overpowered and being very detailed, it seems to be&nbsp;inspired by the latest&nbsp;batmobiles.</p>

<p>Other highlights from the build are the angled arrangement of the rudders and&nbsp;the opening cage that fits perfectly once closed. As a&nbsp;dune buggy&nbsp;is&nbsp;very accurate&nbsp;with an aggressive profile, big rugged black wheels, steering wheel&nbsp;and&nbsp;the added lights in the front and roof. A couple of stud shooters are also included on both sides, these work fine as a play feature but look weird facing diagonally (it should be easy to integrate them in the front section or the underside, or just scrap them completely).</p>

<p>The overall clever and&nbsp;polished design make up for a pleasant building experience and the finished set is fun,&nbsp;playable and sturdy. I am very found on all the&nbsp;features and its aesthetics, it is a great&nbsp;bat vehicle.</p>
