<p>When Robin gawked at the Bat shuttle, it was only a matter of time until Lego produced one, and finally it did in the January 2018 Batman Movie wave of sets. An armed space shuttle for Batman is a bit out there... but as it is out there, I felt I had to add it to my collection. In the end, I was not disappointed. The building experience was good (it took me about 90 minutes to finish the set), and the result looks the part. There are some special (and big) parts included, most notably the cockpit of the space shuttle and the two top halves of the primary launch rocket. The minifigures - Batman, Dick Grayson and Catwoman - are OK, the three space suits look much better (counted as minifigures, but no heads). In total there are three&nbsp;vehicles: the space shuttle, the jet-engine powerd canoe, and a moon-buggy. These three vehicles and the minifigures offer quite a bit of play, even more so since the shwooshable space shuttle can be detached from the rockets (the boosters can be taken off as well) and is armed with stud shooters.</p>

<p>Is the set worth its price? I would argue it is, barely, as&nbsp;IMHO it is on the edge of being overpriced. At least in part the price of the set is explained by the big (specialist) parts and the three special minifigs/suits.</p>

<p>It&nbsp;is definitely worth looking for this set at&nbsp;a discounted price, or picking it up when you stumble on a discount.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build is quite easy;&nbsp;there are few if any tricky construction sequences. The 12 stickers by and large are easy to apply - the most tricky are the two stickers on the booster rockets, due to the curved surface. Two bags are used to build the space shuttle, one to build the booster rockets, and two to build the launch pad. Most interesting to me was the way the designer has constructed the exhausts (creative use of a tub) and attached the batwings to the space shuttle. It was nice to see the whole set come together. Building the booster rockets became somewhat repetitive, and building the launch pad was&nbsp;OK, but nothing special.</p>

<h2>The minifigures<br />
&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Lego lists the set with 6 minifigures. Most normal people would say the set has three minifigures (Dick Grayson, Batman and Catwoman) and three suits. Batman is very common (found in 5 other sets), and Catwoman is also found in the Catcycle chase (70902). Catwoman has a nice print on the torso (front and back) and legs. She has two face prints. Dick Grayson is similar to the one found in the collectible miniseries sets.</p>

<p>The three suits are very nice. The Firestarter Batsuit is the least spectacular. Batman space suit looks very good, while Robin&#39;s Raggae&nbsp;Man&nbsp;suit looks completely ridiculous. My guess is these three will become somewhat collectible.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The space shuttle - simply named &#39;Bat Shuttle&#39; -&nbsp;looks great (and is clearly the centre piece of this set). It looks beautiful, there are no&nbsp;ugly gaps and other oddities. The black and red pin-stripe look is consistent with the rest of the Batman vehicles, and implemented nicely in the design. The one concession made is on the underside, as the shuttle has to attach to the launch rockets. There is no undercarriage. The print on the nose cone looks awesome. There is only space for one minifigure in the cockpit. Additional minifigures have to be put in the cargo hold, at the expense of the lunar buggy.&nbsp;The booster rockets look well proportioned in relation to the space suttle. Personally I might have preferred the main rocket to be a bit taller, but that is an easy modification to make if one has the right parts.</p>

<p>The jet-powered canoe is a nice funny addition. The launching pad itself is OK, and rather basic. I like the colour scheme, and it fits in nicely with that of the Bat-cave (in the Bat-cave break in set (70909)). Its basic looks seems to have been a bit of a trade-off. For play it is quite sufficient, while fleshing it out further would only have driven up the price (probably by a lot) and served to make it overpriced for those looking to buy a play set. It would clearly have turned it into more of an AFOL set. As such, it leaves plenty of room to build for improvement. Note that the pad can be combined with the Bat-cave Break-in set to form one large &#39;console&#39;. One might need a few additional bricks though to actually fix them together.</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>This set does lend itself for display, but above all seems to be a play set. The space shuttle is very swooshable, does have four stud shooters, and the booster rockets can be taken off (just as in real life). The space shuttle itself can quite easily be handled by smaller children, however, when attached to the booster rockets it is big, bulky and carries some weight, and is therefore not that easy to handle. At this point it easily&nbsp;fills the hands of an adult. The cargo bay and cockpit are easily accessible.</p>

<p>The suit selection aisle is nothing special, and I am left to wonder why the rack was made movable at all. Also, the opportunity to have Batman and Robin change suits is a nice feature.</p>

<p>To truly turn this set into a display piece, IMHO one has to modify and expand the launch pad. The shuttle is good enough, the launch pad not yet. The one draw back IMHO compared to other Bat vehicles is that it is not in any way as unique (or ridiculous) a vehicle as the Batwing or the Scuttler in looks and - to me personally - in appeal.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall this is, I think, a good set - and arguably the best of the 2018 wave of Batman Movie sets so far, if one ignores the price. The price itself cannot be ignored, though it is somewhat justified by the large specialist pieces&nbsp;as well as the three suits/minifigures included in this set. IMHO if you really want this set, I think you can justify paying RRP;&nbsp;however, if you can find this set at a discount, this set is definitely worth it. To me it is not as special as say the Batwing or the Scuttler, but definitely a nice set to have.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
I just assembled this sublime box of Lego Batman Movie 70923. I know the set was released quite a while already, and we don&#39;t surf on the Batman wave anymore, but I bought it at the last wave of sales and this was the opportunity or never.&nbsp; This is one of the last sets that I miss to complete this series.<br />
This is a semi-big box from my point of view, the set is not huge once assembled but it can be attached as an extension to Batcave 70909.<br />
<br />
Five packets in all, the first 3 for the shuttle and rockets and the other 2 for the small control platform with the support of the costumes and the base for takeoff.<br />
The construction is very interesting and diversifying with Technic at the beginning then evolves with the basic parts to make the lower part of the shuttle.<br />
Then the upper part with small details in the cockpit and the mini-rover hiding in the belly of the shuttle.<br />
There are a lot of small details on the surface like small guns, movable wings or the middle that opens for the small rover, everything to make it as authentic as possible.<br />
However, I find that a small bridge is missing for example to enter the cockpit, or small cables that attach would do much great work.<br />
With the third and last bag for the shuttle you have to climb the three rockets. Two identical on the sides and one in the middle as a support, everything together just clicks on the shuttle, and I must say I love the efficiency of the system.<br />
<br />
The control platform consists of a sliding stand for three suits, an arsenal of weapons and a computer.&nbsp; There is also a lighting tower.<br />
The base part for takeoff is simple, the shuttle comes to land next to it, and there is a support for the kayak that turns on itself.<br />
<br />
Personally I loved setting up the set and I can not wait to see how it fits with all the other sets in this range.<br />
What attracted me the most is the three exclusive costumes for this set and I&#39;m looking forward to doing a great Batcave with lots of costumes<br />
from different eras and different sets, such as the last set from Marvel with Iron Man.<br />
<br />
I think the price is quite basic but with a good promotion it is well worth buying.&nbsp; The rocket is just sublime on a shelf and the three figurines indispensable for a Batman wardrobe.<br />
There are still stickers 12 in total but also an impression on the front of the cockpit.<br />
<br />
So that&#39;s all for me. Have a good reading and do not hesitate to ask if you have any questions or simply give your opinion on this set.<br />
<br />
Have a good day and see you next time.</p>
