<p>This is the&nbsp;first set of the latest wave of Batman Movie sets. I chose to get this one for both the idea behind the set, the look of the canon ball truck&nbsp;and the minifigures&nbsp;(or rather three of them). And frankly I was not disappointed: the build was nice, the minifigures&nbsp;look great, and Harley Quinn can actually be fired from the gun (shooting about a foot). The biggest issue is the price, which is comparatively high.</p>

<p>Personally this set has a much greater appeal to me than - for instance - the Killer Crock and Bane sets.&nbsp;I would definitely recommend this set if it can be found on sale somewhere; if having to pay full price I would be a bit more hesitant.</p>

<h2>Building experience</h2>

<p>As with pretty much all sets in the Batman Movie range, there are a number of stickers that have to be applied (12 or so), some patience and Windex made it fairly easy for most of them. The two &#39;buildings&#39; in the set are the first builds (in bag 1). They are nice, but more a suggestion of a setting for a scene than an actual building. They are quick and easy builds - though two highly visible stickers have to be applied, and to be applied carefully.</p>

<p>The car is a nice build as well. Some technic parts, some colourful pieces (hidden from view). Not too many interesting techniques, but it does the job. In general the way the truck is built up is nice. The one tricky element is properly applying the sticker to the front of the bonnet: due to the curvature one either has to gamble to get it lined up properly without using Windex, or one has to take some&nbsp;time to get it done. To me, leaving the stickers off is not an option, as they greatly enhance the looks of the vehicle.The stickers on the two halves of the gun are much easier to apply.</p>

<p>Overall a fairly easy build, that would take around an hour, or an hour and a half for most children. Children (especially younger ones) might need some help with the stickers, to get them aligned properly.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>The three bad guy (and girl) minifigures&nbsp;are highlights of this set, and unique. Batgirl is a common figure (found in three other sets, of which the Catcycle&nbsp;chase set (70902) is much cheaper).</p>

<p>Crazy Quilt is a nice figure with a double face print, though pales in comparison to Harley Quinn and Gentleman Ghost. The helmet seems to be an existing mould (as it has the attachment for a visor) though I have no idea where it can be found.</p>

<p>Harley Quinn in her cannon ball suit is very nice. The print of the torso is excellent, with the diamond pattern carried on both front and back.The helmet is a motor cycle helmet, moulded in dual colour. There is a double face print, one expression as if she is&nbsp;laughing, and one&nbsp; as if she is screaming mid flight. The print of the goggles is excellent. The cape has print on only one side, and is a two-piece of the stiffer paper-like cloth. Getting the collar in the correct shape involves some work.</p>

<p>Gentleman Ghost IMHO is the star minifigure of this set. I love the all-white figure, with the nice silver print on the torso (only on the front though). The head is transparent, with the sole exception of a subtle silver print of a monocle for the right eye. The cape id of the paper-like stiff variety. To me Gentleman Ghost probably ranks in the top five of the minifigures in the whole of the Batman Movie range sets, and holds up well against the figures in the&nbsp;collectible series.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>To me the two structures serve their purpose. Apparently many people do not like this set up, and prefer actual buildings, but IMHO they do an OK job. Leaving them out would have left a fairly bare bones set of a car with some minifigures - of which there are numerous already in the Batman Movie&nbsp;range sets. Turning the structures into a full building&nbsp;would have raised the price considerably, to the point where IMHO it would be overpriced,&nbsp;as one gets this set for the vehicle (and maybe the minifigures), not the building. One of the structures has an ATM (and some hidden dynamite as a booby trap inside) in the wall, which unfortunately is fixed and cannot be blown out.</p>

<p>The vehicle is nice, though fairly stocky and compact. I like the bulky look, and the hot-rod-like design. The interior is rather barren, and might have been spiced up a bit. The mechanism by which the cannon&nbsp;is attached to the vehicle is OK, though I am not sure how easily it could be improved upon. There is a hitch at the back, and I have seen it suggested somewhere that it could be used to tow Harley Quinn&#39;s gattling gun in the Batwing set.&nbsp;The colour scheme is logical, and consistent with that of Harley Quinn, and the stickers add to the looks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>Beyond a doubt this is primarily a play set (though I will mostly use it for display). It is a nice little build, but nothing on the scale or outlandishness of for instance the Batmobile, Joker&#39;s Notorious Low-rider, or Penguin&#39;s Arctic Roller. It simply lacks the wow-factor to enable it to be a stand-alone display.</p>

<p>The cannon is clearly meant for play, and works well.&nbsp;The vehicle is easy to handle, and it&nbsp;is easy to insert a minifigure in the cab. Getting a minifig&nbsp;inserted properly into the cannon (so it can be launched) is a little more tricky for the caped characters, but not too difficult. The &#39;buildings&#39; offer a nice stage to pose Batgirl&nbsp;trying to zapp&nbsp;the bad guys. The numerous minifigures add to the play value.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall I like this set, and am happy I bought it. It is a nice, fun build, and the minifigures are excellent. The stickers add nicely to the looks of the vehicle, and the big one with the posters on the wall of one of the structures is great. The three unique minifigures in this set are good (Crazy Quilt)&nbsp;to excellent (Harley Quinn and Gentleman Ghost) and somewhat justify the price, which to me borders on being overpriced. Compared to other vehicles - the Arctic Roller, the Notorious Low-rider, the Batmobile, the&nbsp;Two-Face doule demolition set and even the Riddle Racer - the vehicle simply looks small for its full price</p>

<p>If you really want this set, you can justify paying full price, but personally I would try to look for a discount.</p>

"KoolKreeper489","2018-11-20T12:52:58.763Z","Harley Quinn Cannonball Attack Review","<p>The&nbsp;Harley Quinn Cannonball Attack set is a nice set from The Lego Batman Movie them. It includes Harley Quinn&#39;s truck, 2 side buildings, and 4 minifigures. It was released in 2018 for&nbsp;$49.99 and has 425 pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><strong>Batgirl- </strong>This is the main version of Batgirl in The Lego Batman Movie and was in 4 set total. A really good minifigure that isn&#39;t hard to get. 9/10</p>

<p><strong>Harley Quinn- </strong>This version of Harley Quinn is in her canon ball suit and is exclusive to this set. A nice new version of Harley Quinn we didn&#39;t need but great to get. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Gentleman Ghost- </strong>This minifigure is great and has gray printing on a white torso which looks cool. He has a clear head with a monocle&nbsp;printed on it. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Crazy Quilt- </strong>This is weird villain to get but still is a nice minifigure. Decent printing all around. 9.5/10</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Harley Quinn&#39;s truck looks really good in my opinion. The 2 side buildings are lacking but still are a nice addition. The truck has a canon on it that you can put Harley Quinn&nbsp;in and shoot her out. The hood on the truck can open to see the engine. The 2 dish pieces on the side if the canon are printed. I don&#39;t like how the wheels just stick out though. The builds are not perfect but still are good. 9/10</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>This set has great minifigures and good builds. The truck looks good and the side builds are small but do their job. I recommend this set if you want good minifigures and like the truck.</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2020-06-11T13:49:59.43Z","Cannonball!","<p>So, I got this set couple months ago on half off. Thanks to the great price, I was finally willing to get the set. I&rsquo;ve been recently doing a hunt for Lego Batman Movie sets as it&rsquo;s a theme I really regret not getting much sets of 3 years ago, so this set fits very nicely in my collection.</p>

<h3>The &nbsp;Build</h3>

<p><br />
<strong><em>Harley&rsquo;s Cannon Truck:&nbsp;</em></strong>First off, I just want to say that the minifig shooting cannon works SO well, it&rsquo;s a basic mechanism where you attach a figure to studs on the inside of the cannon, and it&rsquo;s fired by pushing the technic pin at the back of the build. It works surprisingly well and it&rsquo;s very fun to play around with. Other things I like about the cannon is how it could rotate around and go up and down to aim for your target, the wheels use printed dishes which came out very well and the inclusion of a fuse was nice, also 2 stickers were used for the cannon (They were big stickers on big pieces which was a bit of a pain to apply, and I would&rsquo;ve rather have them be printed, but no big deal). In front of the cannon are some lights using 1 by 1 translucent blue and yellow studs to show that the cannon is being illuminated. At the back of the vehicle is where you could find a sticker that says &ldquo;I love&nbsp;PUDDIN&rsquo; &ldquo; which is probably my favorite sticker of the set, next to it is a hitch to connect Harley&rsquo;s stud shooter cannon from set 70916 using a ball joint connection, it&rsquo;s a pretty nice idea. We now move to the front half of the vehicle, the interior has a steering wheel and space for 1 minifigure only with a seat piece, and there&rsquo;s also doors to each side of the truck that could actually open, I like the inclusion since we don&rsquo;t see doors on Lego trucks very often, each door has a sticker as well with red and black diamond emblems. The roof has a black and white speaker that&rsquo;s adjustable, of course you seat your figure in the vehicle by removing the roof. The front hood design was pretty well detailed, I like how there&rsquo;s more exhaust pipes and how the hood can be lifted up to reveal the engine. The hood itself has 2 diamond emblem stickers and a sticker of a hyena face design. A grill piece attached via a hinge could also be found, it&rsquo;s in a metallic grey coloring which is a&nbsp;&nbsp;color that only comes in one other set so it was nice to get and pretty well integrated into the build. Finally there&rsquo;s a license plate that uses a sticker that says &ldquo;H4RL3Y&rdquo; pretty much almost spelling Harley. Overall, it&rsquo;s a pretty awesome vehicle with great details and stickers around it, it definitely screams Harley Quinn to me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Side Buildings: </strong>I kinda&nbsp;have&nbsp;mixed feelings about the side buildings of the set, they&rsquo;re not awful by any means, but nothing too special either. One build has a lamppost and trash can to the right and an ATM to the left with a sticker that says Gotham Bank and a security camera using a literal camera piece which was a little funny. Beyond the door of this building is a dynamite, supposedly to surprise anyone who enters. The top has some pretty vacant space to pose your figures, that&rsquo;s about it for this structure. The second building has a big sticker to go on a big panel piece, the sticker itself is pretty cool with wanted posters for Gentleman Ghost and Crazy Quilt, a Gotham Circus poster and what seems to be the Joker symbol. A ladder is provided to climb up to the balcony with more space to pose your figures, nothing is beyond the door this time and nothing&rsquo;s below the balcony. These 2 buildings don&rsquo;t really stand alone as independent builds, but you do have the option of putting them back to back which makes it look better, you get a decent amount of space to pose your figures. We get a lot of vehicles as sets now so having a side build be a building was a nice idea, it was executed decently here and I don&rsquo;t really have much problems with it.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs</h3>

<p><strong>Harley Quinn:</strong>&nbsp;Her cannonball suit has her usual red and black colors which look nice as always with a great torso and back print , her cape is the old papery material which has some great prints of red and black skull designs which looks very awesome, and you don&rsquo;t have to worry about the cape getting damaged by loading the figure in the cannon, the cape can go over it. Her exclusive face prints have a determined and angry face with her goggles printed on, both faces came out very nice and finally, you got her helmet which has the red and black colors again. Overall, she isn&rsquo;t the most detailed minifigure from the theme, but it was a nice exclusive variant of the character, I wish she had some arm printing , but it&rsquo;s not a big deal, I love this figure.</p>

<p><strong>Crazy Quilt:</strong>&nbsp;Now what IS a (sort of) big deal is the disappointing Crazy Quilt minifig, and where the main disappointment comes is with the lack of arm and side leg printing, and even the lack of printing on his helmet as well. The printing for all that was present in the movie, so it&rsquo;s weird that it isn&rsquo;t here, especially for a theme which goes above and beyond for the minifigs. Disappointments aside, I still like this figure, the printing is still good for the legs (with even some hip and feet printing) and front and back of the torso. The head provides 2 really expressive faces with a determined smile and a hilarious screaming face.&nbsp;The shoulder armor piece in red isn&rsquo;t exclusive but nice to get and the helmet piece in red is exclusive and a very nice color to get it in. Overall, I&rsquo;m still disappointed with the lack of detailing for the arms and side leg, I definitely would&rsquo;ve liked this figure more if they were present, but despite my problems with him ,I still like the figure and it was a good addition to the collection of obscure Batman villains.</p>

<p><strong>Gentleman Ghost-</strong> This figure easily takes the #1 spot for the best minifigure of the set. His design is very simple yet very impressive and elegant. I can totally excuse the lack of printing on the legs and back of the torso, because the design is meant to be simple. The torso print is just amazing, the white tuxedo with the silver shine works so well together and it adds to the elegance of the figure. The cape is in the old papery material which I don&rsquo;t mind. The head was also pretty awesome using a clear head piece with a monocle printed on. The top hat piece in white is exclusive to this set and finally, his accessory is a white cane. Overall, an amazing minifig that impresses me and looks very unique, it&rsquo;s a minifigure that I&rsquo;m very glad to own in my collection and I have no problems with it whatsoever.</p>

<p><strong>Batgirl-</strong> while she&rsquo;s not difficult to get in the theme, she&rsquo;s still a really amazingly detailed minifigure. A lot effort was put into this figure which I really appreciate, I like the side leg printing for the boots of the dual-molded legs and arm printing for the continuation of the suit design. She has the common yellow utility belt piece, her front and back torso printing was also very good. The cape is a different material to the soft one, it has a shine to it that looks awesome. Her facial expressions have a happy and angry expression and the mask was a well made piece that could attach Batgirl&rsquo;s hair using a peg connection. She also comes with a yellow batarang and the return of the phantom zone projector (which was really awesome to get in a cheaper set compared to Arkham Asylum) as her accessories, overall nothing exclusive but still a great figure.</p>

<h3>Value for Money</h3>

<p>The 50 dollar price wasn&rsquo;t exactly the best price for the set... it feels more like a 40 dollar set much like the Joker&rsquo;s Notorious Lowrider. I mean, it&rsquo;s still a decent value, you get 4 minifigs, 3 of which are exclusive and a good size for the truck and buildings. I got this set on a fantastic 50% discount, but I&rsquo;m still judging the score by full price, it&rsquo;s not the worst price out there, but definitely buy it on discount.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>I love this set! The truck was a very fun build with a surprisingly good cannon that can shoot your minifigures pretty far, the buildings add to the scene and the minifigures are great. It seems that not a lot of people were digging the 3rd wave of the Lego Batman Movie sets and didn&rsquo;t want to get this one, and I wasn&rsquo;t sure about getting this one at first ,but once I got it on discount and built it, it surprised me! If you still find it rotting in a store on clearance like I still do where I am, I highly recommend getting this set, it&rsquo;s a pretty good set to add to your collection.</p>
