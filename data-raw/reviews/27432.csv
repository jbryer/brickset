"xboxtravis7992","2018-04-24T18:40:53.663Z","Quirky Set for a Quirky Film","<p>This was one of those sets I was not planning on getting. I just so happened to be in the store with a hankering to buy some Lego. The store didn&#39;t stock any of the smaller Solo sets I was considering getting, and the only Infinity War sets I wanted that the store had were the more expensive ones (or Thor&#39;s Weapon Quest which I don&#39;t want to purchase until I can afford to buy it alongside the new Guardians ship). I gave a glance at The Lego Batman sets that have sort of been shelf warming for over a year, and saw this absurdist gem just sitting there. Five minifigures of the Justice League and a silly party scene for just $27? Well I took the bait... So how does this quirky set stack up?<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><em>Superman</em> is a comic book icon. 80 years of pop culture dominance, he first appeared in Lego in 2012 during the start of the Superheroes theme. Since I have been primarily a Marvel collector instead of a DC one, I skipped out on those six years of Lego Superman so this is my first Lego rendition of the big blue boyscout! This figure is of course based on the tongue in cheek Lego film rendition voiced by Channing Tatum. The head piece is a unique mold that has previously only shown up on prior Supermen capturing the distinct lick of loose hair on his forehead. The head is double-sided, with one side a smiling face and the other one of surprise or disgust.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Green Arrow</em>; as much as I want to make a joke about how I finally got a Hawkeye figure from this set; Arrow himself is pretty impressive. The green is in some nice shades, and his outfit does look like a modernized take on the Robin Hood look. His subtle blonde stubble is a cool print, although it takes a good look to notice it. He does not have a double sided headed.<br />
<br />
<em>Hawkgirl</em>; this is one of those figures that I think they could have done much better. The torso print on my sample is not entirely opaque, and the green base color bleeds through to much. I am not a fan of the feel and look of those soft plastic &quot;paper-esque&quot;&nbsp;wings, especially knowing that Lego has produced similar shaped hard plastic wings before. The best thing on the figure is the doublesided head, which much like Supes has a smiling look and a look of shock on the other side. A doublesided&nbsp;head which gets covered by the impressive but bulky helmet...&nbsp; The leg printing while impressive could have used some dual molding to make it look a bit better. That face obscuring helmet, and the sloppy torso printing combined made me initially think this was a Hawkman figure until I got a closer look at it in person.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>El Dorado</em>; one of the obscure figures in the set coming from the old<em> Superfriends </em>TV show. I don&#39;t know much about him, but its a cool enough figure he is probably my favorite one in the set. He has dual molded legs, and a soft red cape which matches Supermans. Like Supes and Hawkgirl he also has a doublesided head.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<em>Wonder Dog</em>; like El Dorado, this is another deeply obscure&nbsp;character from the old <em>Superfriends</em>&nbsp;show. Great little molded animal, cool blue gray color with some good prints. My favorite part is the use of the new cape fabric, which has the cape slide over the figures head. Remove the cape and the figure would be great pooch for use in a Lego City setting.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The main build is a nice small stage set up in Superman&#39;s crystaline home. I like the use of white as a base color and the little transparent pieces used to suggest crystals. The blue and pink lights give it a festive atmosphere conveying the party mood of the scene. The stickers in the set are used to great affect for the DJ stand and the party sign hanging above it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
There are two play features built into the model, a rotating turntable in the front which can be controlled from a knob hidden on the back of the stage. This turntable moves well without friction, and is simple but fun to play with. On the stage is a retractable platform to either raise it up high enough to place Wonder Dog in the DJ&#39;s position, or it can be retracted to allow one of the human characters take the position.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Verdict</strong><br />
<br />
This is a bizarre set, but it is wonderfully quirky and unique. The amount of figures included is spectacular for a MSRP of $30, although I do think Hawkgirl in particular falls a bit short in terms of quality. The problem about this set is that this set invites its owner to buy up some other Lego Batman sets to further flesh out the party scene,or buy the Collectible Minifigure series (which includes other party guests from the film such as the Wonder Twins in its blind bags!) This set is a fun quirky build, and overall I am impressed with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In an effort to complete my collection of The Lego Batman Movie sets, this was one of the last sets I got, and arguably the one lowest on my list. The build, however, was a very pleasant surprise. Building the set was fun, and in the end actually looked better than I expected.&nbsp;The minifigures&nbsp;are uncommon, but excellent. The European price is a bit high, IMHO, especially for a &#39;static&#39; set. The one major issue I have with this set is that it suffers from the &#39;there-must-be-bright-off-colour-parts-that-subsequently-are-an-eyesore&#39; disease that unfortunately infects modern LEGO sets way too often. The build itself was quite simple and fun.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build itself was quick and easy: it took about 40 minutes to put the set together. There were a few easy stickers to apply, and that was it. The steps are logical, and I liked the way the stage was put together. The round platform can rotate, and is operated through an axle-and-cog system operated from the back of the music stand. The whole design of the stand looks better in real life than in pictures, IMHO.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are four minifigures included in this set: Hawkgirl, Superman, El Dorado, and Green Arrow. Wonder Dog is not listed as a minifigure, but is quite nice. I like the dog minifigure; the cape does not come off too easily, which is good.</p>

<p>Superman is an OK figure;&nbsp;I like his two facial expressions, but IMHO by far the best part is his hair piece. The torso print (front and back) is OK.</p>

<p>Green Arrow has a single face print, and reminds me a but of a Robin Hood figure, or the figures of the Castle Series of old. The prints on the front and back of the torso, and the legs look nice and are well done.&nbsp;Personally, I am not a fan of the green bow-and-arrow or the green quiver.&nbsp;</p>

<p>El Dorado is the third caped figure in this set. His smug face print (one of the alternates) in combination with the hair piece makes me thing of some 1980&#39;s TV-characters. The torso print is very nice, front and back, and in register. It is continued nicely on the legs. The legs, are a dual-mold, with a nice print for the boots.</p>

<p>The most spectacular figure is Hawkgirl. She has a very nice print on the front and back of the torso, as well as the legs, with no sign of colors bleeding through. Most of the two face prints is hidden underneath the helmet. The helmet is spectacular. There is a choice of wings, made of a plastic identical to that which is found in the sails of Final Flight of Destiny&#39;s Bounty (set 70738).</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The stage itself looks quite nice, and actually begs for a bigger setting. As said before, it looks much better in person than in the official photographs. The mechanism to rotate the platform is fairly unobtrusive, if not for the ugly bright red connector piece. If you have a spare, swap it out asap. I am actually seriously considering brick-linking for a replacement that is less of an eyesore.</p>

<p>The lanterns, the lights, all of it looks very nice. So does the effective design of the DJ platform. With relatively few pieces the designer has created quite a good and effective set.</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>Personally, I would probably rate this as a play set more than a display set. For a display set, it needs a but of additional structures being included. As a play set, it does not offer too much room to display figures. It is almost a back ground piece. IMHO it lacks the bulk to make a play-space like a house setting could.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>IMHO this set suffers from the fact that it tries to represent a scene in the movie that is difficult, if not impossible to reproduce in a Lego set, at least at this price point. The major selling point for this set is clearly the collection of minifigures - of which there are four (or five if you include Wonder Dog) unique ones. Unfortunately, IMHO, this is quickly undone by the unsightly red connector piece. The European RRP arguably makes this one the least attractive sets within the Batman Movie Range - even though it turned out better than I thought it would be. If you really like this set, or the minifigures, I would say: go for it. Otherwise, wait until you can find it at a serious discount.</p>

"JayTheNinja19","2020-11-15T21:25:24.36Z","The Justice League Anniversary Party: Great Minifigures, Decent build","<p>This set is very much different from what we&#39;ve seen from other sets in The LEGO Batman Movie line. This set is very much Minifig&nbsp;focused, and is a very scene-specific set, with no villains. The 4 Minifigs are: Superman, Green Arrow, Hakwgirl, and lastly, a hero I&#39;d never heard of prior to buying this set, El Dorado. I like how they chose&nbsp;some Minifigs that are deliberately rather obscure characters. It lends well to the idea of The Justice League Anniversary Party&nbsp;being this huge get-together that Batman was obviously not invited to. He&#39;s not a minifigure, but the colourful Wonder Dog is also included. He appears to be a blue German Shepherd, with a green cape. He makes for a rather cute character, and for me he just rounds off the whole minifigure selection well. Superman, El Dorado, and Hawkgirl all feature dual-sided heads, with some happy expressions, and some more embarrassed faces, for when Batman founds out he wasn&#39;t invited to the party. I&#39;d give the Minifigs a nice 9.5/10</p>

<p>As for the build, there&#39;s not a great deal to talk about. The centre build is fun to build, and accommodates both human and canine DJs nicely, which is a&nbsp;clever detail. The main play feature is a rotating function for what is meant to be the centre dance-floor. The feature works well, and can hold several minifigures if positioned well. Aside from that, there&#39;s not really much to the build, aside from the party lights&nbsp;and speakers, along with the banner. My one complaint about the build is that it feels like it&#39;s a bit wide, and if&nbsp;it were able to fold in&nbsp;I would be completely happy. I think 7/10 meets the case here.</p>

<p>Lastly, the value is not the best. Well, it&#39;s a slightly complicated problem for me. In South Africa where I live, I paid R620 ZAR, which is almost exactly $40, which is $10 more than the US price. So, I&#39;d say that the value in the US is perfect, but it was a little steep for me. Keep in mind that the bulk of value in this set comes from the exclusive minifigures, and not really the build. For value, 7/10 is my score, but if I had bought the set in the US, I&#39;d award 8/10.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a really fun set, which makes my shelf look&nbsp;alive and enjoyable. The Minifigs are super, the build is decent, and the price is OK. My overall calculation is that this set earns 82/100, which I think is a good evaluation of this sets merits, and its faults.</p>
