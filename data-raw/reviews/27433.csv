"Mystical_Narwhal","2018-01-18T02:59:59.55Z","Great Set in every way","<p>When I first saw this set I was EGG-static (sorry), as I am mainly a minifigure collector this was great, the two exclusive fun villains were something I had to SCRAMBLE for.&nbsp;I was pleasantly surprised by how good of a set it is even without the figures, there are many great play features and funny quirks BOILED into one small set. The overall price of the set was perfect for this set and definitely&nbsp;worth the money (unlike another&nbsp;Harley Quinn truck set *cough* *cough*).</p>

<p>I bought this set for its ridiculousness and - in general - and to add it to my collection of the Batman Movie line. I was not sure what to make of it beforehand. The build was nice, with some fun parts to build. In the end the mech looks IMHO better in real life than on the box and in many of the images. It is rather stocky, and overall a nice design, with the core-structure nicely covered in all but one place. The minifigures are quite good. In general I think it will make for a decent play set. Overall, I think it offers (barely) acceptable value for money in Euros, and a better value for&nbsp;money in dollars.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build itself is fairy quick - it took me about 45-50 minutes, including the application of the stickers (which added somewhere between 5 and 10 minutes due to my Windex use). The sticker application takes some care, especially the three stickers applied to the transparent &#39;tube&#39; backpiece for the ammunition production carried on the back.&nbsp;The given age range is 7-14; is would argue a good number of 5 or 6 year&nbsp;olds should be able to build this set. First built is the cabin/torso of the vehicle. I am not sure there are any truly unique parts, other than the disc-with-print for the egg shooter (the left arm of the mech). The dome is nice. The way the stand for Egghead&nbsp;is constructed is nice. The design for the feet looks similar to that of the feet of for instance the recently released Hulkbusters. The mech does not topple over easily. During the build there was nothing that stood out to me as particularly clever in design.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are three minifigures included: the ubiquitous Batman, while Egghead and Condiment King are unique to this set.&nbsp;This version of Batman is found in 6 other sets, though his armament - a grappling hook gun - is different from the usual Batarangs.</p>

<p>Egghead has white cloth coat-tails, that fit the torso print. He has no back-print, or print on the legs and also a single face print (not surprising, as he is bold). I really like the angry mustache.&nbsp;I am not sure the egg-head dome is a unique part or not. I like the printed suit on the torso, the cravat seems to hint at some egg-based dish (a poached egg maybe?). IMHO backprint on the torso would have made this figure much better.</p>

<p>Condiment King, like Egghead, only has a print on the front side of the torso, which for him is more logical, due to his backpack. Any print on the back would not be seen anyway. His legs are dual moulded (blue suit, white boots), with a white underpants print - with on the legs the blue bleeding through, unfortunately.The two faces are printed on a&nbsp;green background; here the green does not seem to bleed through, and if it does it is not clear. Condiment King is armed with two stud-shooters representing ketchup(?) and mustard(?) guns, with the bottles carried on the back (much like oxygen tanks for divers).</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>This is simply a weir vehicle, but very well designed. The egg-theme has been carried through many of the details: the colour scheme, the shape of the main torso of the mech,&nbsp;the whisk-arm on the right, and the egg-shooter (various recipes, from scrambled to fried), the images on the vehicle, the chicken-coop tank on the back, all work well. The one minor nit-pick is the bright red core structure piece that is visible at the top/back. It simply looks&nbsp;off - even when it is clear there is a &#39;structural backside&#39; in gray in the design. The cabin for Egghead is nice, with the steering gear constructed from fan an &#39;plug&#39; pieces rather than the standard antenna/lever pieces. The legs are slightly posable, the range of movement is limited. Also, part of the &#39;egg gun&#39; might interfere with the fright egg shooter-play feature.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs display.</h2>

<p>IMHO this is more of a play than a display set. Movable arms, the fried-egg disk-shooter, Condiment King&nbsp;with his two stud guns, the whisk that can rotate. It has quite a few features, and handles easily. The disk-shooter has to be operated by hand though. The egg-laying tank on the back is surprisingly sturdy. The two curved pieces (the &#39;top of the egg&#39;) unfortunately do come off easily. The mech handles easily, and should be easy to hold for children. It is also quite stable when put on a flat surface. It seems like a good &#39;enemy&#39; for one of the Batman vehicles.</p>

<p>The set can be displayed, though it is rather small in size. It is striking though. Personally I would look to exchange some of the plates for different colours for a more uniform look. This set could be an inspiration for MOC design for a much larger mech.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, my view of this set is more positive than I thought it would be. The box art and the online images IMHO do not do it complete justice. The arms are quite posable, the legs less so. Together with Condiment King it makes for a nice bad guy attack on something - it almost begs to be combined with a Batman vehicle. Egghead and Condiment King are unique and nice figures. Overall the price - especially in Europe - is high, and I am not sure it is justified entirely by the inclusion of these two minifigures, or big and unique parts (there were none that truly stood out to me). A good number of sets at that price point also simply look bigger, and therefore feel to offer more value for money. The US price is much more reasonable to me. When found at European RRP, it is worthy of consideration, but in general I would be looking for a discount. That said, IMHO this is a set that should appeal to fans of the Lego Batman Movie line, those looking for crazy vehicles, and those looking for an unusual play set for kids.</p>

"LegoBatmanLandon","2018-04-14T18:32:23.477Z","an Egg-cellent set.","<p>this is an overall great set for collectors and play. and let me Egg-plain why.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>the Egg-cellent build</strong></p>

<p>this is an Egg-cellent&nbsp;set with a unique model of mech that isn&#39;t an overused style of mechs&nbsp;( I&#39;m looking at you, set 76097) it has a Egg-squisite&nbsp;curved oval shaped design that has a beater, fried egg blaster, an Egg-splosive&nbsp;play feature, and a tank in the back with egg-stremely&nbsp;good sticker detailing. overall, an Egg-ceptionally&nbsp; Egg-cellent&nbsp;set.</p>

<p><strong>the Egg-citing minifigures</strong></p>

<p>there are 2&nbsp;Egg-stravegant&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;of Egg-head and Condiment king. now I don&#39;t want to Eggs-aggerate, but&nbsp;Egg-head has an odd, but Egg-cellent&nbsp;head piece that can be used as a bald cap, a face that looks like Danny&nbsp;Devito&nbsp;from Matilda, and a Eggs-clusive&nbsp;torso and coat tails. the condiment king is probably the reason most people will be buying the set, because I predict that in about, probably 3 years from now, this minifigure will be pretty Egg-spensive, and then there&#39;s Batman, pretty disappointing, but is Egg-ceptional&nbsp;for this set.</p>

<p>Pros: condiment king, Egg-head, the overall mech, the 3 printed 2x2 circular tiles that have fried egg prints, the printed dish on the gun, the disc-shooter.</p>

<p>Cons: Batman is the common version, the condiment has stud shooters instead of the recolored squishe.</p>

<p>but overall, a great set for many&nbsp;different Lego fans.</p>

"Bowtie_Bricks","2020-06-09T19:56:39.06Z","A clever, pun filled, set","<p>Although the figure selection is a bit dry, the build for the mech more than makes up for it. With limited stickers, it is great for a young child to try to build on their own. The beautiful round curves of the cockpit really do make you think of an egg, and the whisk hand is a clever idea. Even if you don&#39;t want to play with it, this set has a lot of details for a $30 set. There is a chamber on the back with chickens laying eggs to shoot out of the hand, and the legs have plenty of posable positions. If you only get one Batman Movie set, I urge you to get this one.</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2020-03-03T09:37:04.14Z","This set is eggcel- wait, thatâ€™s an overused pun.","<p>Yes this set is indeed , excellent! It&#39;s filled with cheesy (yet&nbsp;still hilarious) egg puns around the build, fun play features and the egg-xtra&nbsp;wackiness than&nbsp;what you would typically&nbsp;find in a Lego Batman Movie&nbsp;set about an obscure villain&#39;s vehicle, and it still gets better than that!</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>As I said, the build for the mech is very fun,&nbsp;wacky and so ridiculous that you just can&#39;t help but love it. Lego has been making many mechs recently with mostly mixed results, but this set has always seemed to me as a great mech build that stands as one of Lego&#39;s better ones , which is something to behold considering the piece count. It has good amount of poses&nbsp;for the arms and legs , arms are attached using ratcheted joints&nbsp;and the legs use ball joints. The right arm is an eggbeater that has 3 fingers attached to mini ball joints that can be positioned to grab a minifigure. The main play feature is to spin the eggbeater &nbsp;which is always fun to do, there&#39;s also a sticker&nbsp;on the shoulder&nbsp;that says &quot;Beat-o-Matic&quot;&nbsp;with a range of 1 to 3 which was a great sticker. The left arm is an egg shooter that uses the disc shooter to shoot out an egg, and it works very well. The egg shot out of the gun is a 2 by 2 printed circular tile , which is pretty useful and was nice to get 2 extras of. The gun also comes with a printed dish design that says Free Range at the bottom and a range from yellow to red that says &quot;Scrambled&nbsp;and &quot;Fried&quot;&nbsp;which was just hilarious and a great print in general, the shoulder for this arm has a sticker of a chicken head on it. The gun is also attached to a tube from the egg container at the back, which leads us to the back of the mech with a container design holding 3 eggs and a plain white chicken (supposedly laying the eggs so that it can be shot out of the gun) ,&nbsp;the design is fully enclosed with clear pieces and even using a dome piece at the top&nbsp;, another&nbsp;egg pun could be&nbsp;found&nbsp;using a sticker that says EGG-SPLOSIVES which was another great sticker. The legs are pretty short , but still able to make poses , using 2&nbsp;points of articulation with ball joints. The cockpit looks complete with a fairly large windshield&nbsp;and controls for Egghead ,&nbsp;he&#39;s attached using two studs two make him stand. The cockpit also kind of resembles an egg and a chicken (if you look at it sideways). Overall, a very fun and perfect build that&#39;ll fit right in with the other villain vehicles in the theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Minifigures&nbsp;</h2>

<p><strong>Batman:</strong>&nbsp;Obviously you get another Batman in this set, which is... ok. He comes with his grappling hook , the usual&nbsp;yellow utility belt piece and the newer style soft cape. He&nbsp;uses a stern and a confused/worried face print which aren&#39;t exclusive.</p>

<p><strong>Egghead: </strong>Egghead&nbsp;is an exclusive figure to the set, his torso uses a nice white jacket design with yellow, colors probably representing the egg shell and the yolk, the back of his torso is unprinted which I wish&nbsp;was printed, but no big deal. He also comes with a coattail in white using the older style, papery material. His face print has an angry expression with a mustache,the best part of him is obviously the useful new mold of his head itself that can be used for different custom figures. Overall, nice figure to add to the Batman villain collection.<br />
<br />
<strong>Condiment King:</strong>&nbsp;The standout figure of the set is easily the Condiment King. He&#39;s also an exclusive figure to the set, the legs use a dual-molded design with blue and white&nbsp; and he also has a funny&nbsp;underpants design. The torso has his Condiment King symbol and straps printed for his ketchup and mustard pack, unfortunately no back torso printing, but it didn&#39;t bother me as much as Egghead since he has the condiment pack to cover it. His head is printed with a base color of green to match his helmet, unfortunately for that reason the skin color came out a bit off on the face prints, the face prints have an angry and a barfing expression , both have a nice sliver shine for his glasses&nbsp;(the barf expression has a little bit of mustard printed on his mouth which was great). He has 2 stud shooters to shoot out ketchup and mustard, the shooters are connected &nbsp;to the condiment pack (which is attached to the figure using a neck attachment)&nbsp;, cleverly using whip pieces. Overall, despite the problems on the face prints and the lack of back torso printing, I still love this figure and he&#39;s definitely one of the more memorable figures of the theme.</p>

<h2>Value for Money</h2>

<p>What&#39;s included in this set&nbsp;is great, but the price felt a little steep. The figures and the build were really good, but perhaps the set could&#39;ve used another figure or a side build to justify the price.</p>

<h2>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Despite the so-so price , this set is still very recommendable for full price. The figures were great and&nbsp;the build was perfect , definitely very wacky and fun in a way that fits in with the theme of The Lego Batman Movie , especially when it&#39;s filled with obscure villains that are unheard of in Batman lore. A very collectible and fun set that will definitely satisfy.</p>
