<p><strong>Mini-figures-&nbsp;</strong>definitely the best part of the set. They are amazing for the price of $15 USD</p>

<p>Captain America or Steve Rogers (or whatever he is called now) is a great figure that looks almost perfect. his new head is great as is his torso and hair. His legs could have used some printing, but not a big deal.</p>

<p>Black Widow or Natasha Romanoff&nbsp;is also amazing and she looks pretty good. The vest color isn&#39;t perfect but its close enough and the print is great. the head is fine. The hair is pretty good too, but color is not perfect but once again quite close. So she and Cap are the best parts of the set</p>

<p>The Outriders are pretty cool also and the new back piece is neat. The prints are great, but the legs could have used some print, but not a big deal.</p>

<p><strong>The Outrider Dropship&nbsp;</strong>is pretty cool. It is much taller than I was expecting. It is also the cheapest set with the revived teal color(I think). The build folds open by lowering the windshields&nbsp;and walls. when opened both outriders can be placed in it with the SPACE STONE and it closes up with them very nicely.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This set is amazing. You get 4 great Mini-figures, a decent amount of teal, and an Infinity Stone all in a $15 USD set. I definitely recommend&nbsp;This set</p>

"jakeypoos87","2018-04-03T10:00:19.73Z","Review 76101: Outrider Dropship Attack","<p>Set 76101: Outrider dropship attack is from the new Avengers:Infinity war movie and the set retails for &pound;12 and includes 124 parts with four minifigures.</p>

<p>The minifigs&nbsp;included are black widow who has some good printing on her torso and legs and uses the Jyn Erso face print. she also has her new blonde hair from the movie. She is equipped with two electric batons used from the lightsaber blade pieces. Captain America has some good new printing on his torso but unfortunately there is no printing on his legs but he does have a new bearded duel sided face print with an angry and happy face. He is equipped with his two gauntlets. The other two minifigures&nbsp;are the outriders who have some incredible printing on the head and torso but like the Captain America they also do not have any printing on the legs. They also have the part on their back to attach on the extra four arms.</p>

<p>The build is a dropship&nbsp;for the outriders which is frequently seen in the trailers for the movie. The build has some great detailing on the the sides with the use of some stickers. The interior can be accessed easily by pulling down the panels on the side, front and back. Inside the ship there are two spots to place minifigures&nbsp;and at the front there is a control panel sticker showing black panther. At the back inside the ship there is a spot to place the space stone. The ship also has two stud shooters on the front of the build for play.</p>

<p>Overall I love this set because the minifigures&nbsp;included are a great selection to get in a small set and also the build looks great for display and for play . I cant really think of any issues with the set so would definitely highly reccomend getting this set for its great value , amazing build and minifigures.</p>

"kyloreniscool42","2018-06-20T01:18:14.597Z","Outrider Battle Pack","<p>This set is very much an easy opportunity to obtain masses of Outriders for your Infinity War displays.&nbsp; With an exception of Black Widow and Captain America, it doesn&#39;t hurt to buy a bunch&nbsp;of these.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The four minifigs in this set all appear at the Battle of Wakanda, the part of the movie this set is based on, and are very good. Black Widow looks very tactical, but it would be more accurate if her batons were a stud shorter. They capture Captain America&#39;s new beard well, and the claws pieces they used for his new shields were also fairly accurate. I personally prefer to have him wield them opposite of how the instructions tell you to position them though. The two Outriders are beautifully&nbsp;detailed and are fun to position.</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model</strong></p>

<p>The dropship in the set is a small adaptation of the pods seen in the movie. It folds open like a flower to allow you to insert the Outriders. They slide in perfectly in the tight space. Inside is a stickered control panel and the space stone. Two stud shooters are mounted on the outside of the ship but their&nbsp;transparent orange ammunition&nbsp;is very unnecessarily striking.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This set is great for gathering Outriders. All of the Outriders throughout the sets amount to four, making a small army for play. The minifigs a great, although their accessories are less so.&nbsp; The build is a great vehicle for a small superhero set. In all, this is a must-buy.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2018-04-28T03:35:31.113Z","Final Battle, in a Tiny Package","<p>So first off... I saw Infinity War last night. I will try and keep major spoilers out of this review; but just in case I let something slip; here is your&nbsp;<strong>Spoiler Warning.</strong></p>

<p>The Outrider dropship represents part of the climactic Battle in Wakanada&nbsp;at the end of Infinity War. While not perfect, this set has a lot to love and for its low cost retail price is a great bargain! Lets dive in and see what this pack brings us.<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><em>Captain America/Steve Rogers&nbsp;</em>You know when one figure of a set alone justifies its purchase? Bearded Captain America is the figure in this set. Every torso and head print on this guy is brand new, and his bearded face looks great and is wonderfully accurate. The shield pieces he has use old Lego molds (from Prince of Persia if my memory serves); but are reasonably accurate to the Wakandan shield he carries in the film.</p>

<p><em>Black Widow&nbsp;</em>Natasha like Cap, has appeared in several Lego sets before. This is her third variant, with a new green torso and a blonde colored hair piece. The green is far to bright compared to the costume seen in the film, but helps to make it easy to identify that this Black Widow is unique compared to the black outfits from the previous figures. The head is a re-use of the Jyn Erso&nbsp;print from Rogue One; but it does a decent job of representing&nbsp;Scarlett Johanson&#39;s face in Lego form. Personally I think the Age of Ultron/Civil War figure looks more like the character, but this is an admirable update.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Outriders&nbsp;</em>The minion&#39;s of Thanos and the Black Order that give this set their name. In the film, they are vicious feral fighters and Lego has done a good job with the torso prints and gold highlights, and the new bracket piece to give them four extra arms. Buying the two other sets based on the Wakanda&nbsp;Battle also come with more Outriders; so they are a fairly easy to obtain army builder figure.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Watching the film, I spotted right away the one problem this set has compared to the source material... scale. The actual dropships in the film are multi-story tall nearly building sized alien craft which fell from the sky. In comparison this looks like a scale model of one of those dropships... its got the look and the shape; but is nowhere near the size seen onscreen. But... I think that is okay. Lego hit the $15 price point via making the model this small, and had they made it larger and closer to scale I don&#39;t think it would have looked that interesting compared to the larger sets we got from the theme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a Lego build though, there are some neat tricks up this set&#39;s sleeve. I LOVE that the old teal color has returned to Lego. Its a cool alien colored highlight that runs along much of the set, and really makes it pop. Despite the small size of the ship, both Outriders can fold up their arms and fit in the ship with ease.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
One last detail though is a place to mount the tile holding the Space Stone in the ship. While not film accurate, the inclusion of the six Infinity Stones across the six Lego sets in the theme was an awesome choice on Lego&#39;s part. It gives the collector that sense that they are like Thanos... gathering stone by stone from each set.<br />
<br />
<strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>A small set that does its job really sums up my thoughts on this. Captain America alone makes the&nbsp; purchase worth it. The new Black Widow, two Outriders and the nice teal pieces all top it off with the Space Stone biting the collector&#39;s urge. Fans of the film will enjoy this small set, especially if they are on a budget and looking for something small to add to the collection.&nbsp;</p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2018-05-29T21:25:58.117Z","So, this is Thanos' army? Looks pretty intimidating, what do you think, guys?","<p>As I have said earlier, the Avengers Infinity War line got me really excited as the sets looked really nice and it is a really fun concept to collect these sets to make your own Infinity Gauntlet. So, does this set hold up to the rest of the line? Let&#39;s find out!</p>

<p><strong>*Please note this review is spoiler free for the movie, but may contain spoilers for other Marvel movies preceding this one*</strong></p>

<p><strong>Box and Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>This is the smallest set of the wave, thus having the smallest out of the boxes. However, like the other sets, the artwork is very eye - catching, at least to me. The instructions are very easy to follow, like normal (just be careful when assembling the wings as I&#39;ll discuss later). Also, it is recommended you find something to hold down your instructions with, as they&#39;re not always well folded.</p>

<p><strong>Figures</strong></p>

<p>The set contains four figures, two of them are unique to the set, at this moment. First, is Captain America. His uniform has been updated significantly, featuring darker colors than previous versions of the figure. He is equipped with claws, as his shield was damaged during Civil War (Get this man a shield!). I think this is a interesting choice, even though they are pretty accurate to the movie (Just wish they were in black or pearl gray). Next is Black Widow. To be fair, she is pretty much the same as the other figures since Age of Ultron. The prints might have been updated a bit, her hair is bleached (Black Widow is not Blonde!) and her torso is an interesting sand green color. It may not be accurate, but it is a nice color. Next, we have the two outriders. They are exactly the same. Weird demon like figures with a total of six arms and gold printing. None the less, these are very nice figures even though they look a bit demonic...&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build of this set is very simple, and I think most people can complete in fairly easily. Just be sure to look very carefully at the instructions for the wings, as those are the hardest parts of the set besides the control panel sticker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Completed Model:</b></p>

<p>The model doesn&#39;t take a lot of space when completed, however, for such a small set, it has an impressive amount of height. The small craft can seat both Outriders rather comfortably, although I find folding their back four arms helps to keeps them secure and to help fully close the wings and cockpits. Like I said with the last review, the stickers add a lot of detail to the set. This set contains the space stone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Thoughts:</strong></p>

<p>This is the smallest set of the six Infinity War sets. Not only does it contain an infinity stone, but four great figures and a decent build for a pretty good price. Sets like these are great for those on a tight budget or those who want a cheap souvenir&nbsp;from their vacation. I overall recommend this set, whether you like Marvel movies or not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks and I&#39;ll see you in the next review</p>

"Oregondete81","2018-07-05T15:55:18.547Z","Avengers: Infinity War Dropship w/ Captain America and Black Widow","<p><strong>Item:</strong></p>

<p>This is a model dropship from the Avengers: Infinity War movie. The set is 129 pcs. and includes 4 minifigs(Captain America, Black Widow, and 2 Outriders).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Why I bought this set:</strong></p>

<p>I am a huge fan of the Avengers movies and a collector of the LEGO Avengers sets. I bought this set because the Marketing at LEGO is genius! Splitting up the Infinity stones was marketing gold. I bought the Thanos: Ultimate Battle set(<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76107-1/Thanos-Ultimate-Battle"">76107</a>) which comes with a Thanos&nbsp;mini-fig and the Infinity Gauntlet.This set comes with the Space Stone aka Tesseract(Blue).&nbsp;You must buy the entire series{<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76101-1/Outrider-Dropship-Attack"">76101</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76102-1"">76102</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76103-1"">76103</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76104-1"">76104</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76107-1"">76107</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76108-1"">76108</a>}&nbsp;to complete the Infinity Gauntlet. So naturally, I added this set to begin completing the Infinity Gauntlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>- This is the cheapest set in the Infinity war series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Comes with 4 minifigs including Bearded Captain America&nbsp;and a Blonde Black Widow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- For the value I would imagine this set would have a lot of playability for kids, especially with the four minfigs and blaster function on the dropship.</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>-The set build was slightly underwhelming. It goes together quickly and the build feels a bit plain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The dropship&nbsp;feels a bit flimsy because its so small. It does fit the 2 outriders which is a plus, but it still feels too small and flimsy. Like somewhere between a miniature and full-size version. (Which for $15 was probably what LEGO was going for.)</p>

<p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong></p>

<p>I am happy to add this set to my Infinity War collection, but as an individual set purchase I think there are better options in the Creator, City, and&nbsp;Star Wars lines. I would recommend this set to collectors of the Avengers line and those who collect minifigs, but if you&nbsp;are a parent looking for a more creative set, I think there are some better options out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-29T12:52:48.05Z","Collect the Stones, Phase 1","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #76101 Outrider Dropship Attack: </b>Infinity War has long come and gone and is one of the biggest events in the Marvel Cinematic Universe to date. LEGO captured it within several key scenes and sets. And in order to have all of the Infinity Stones you need to collect all of the sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: The name of the game is Thanos, and Thanos represents Infinity War as the character on the front of the box as he appears in the movie and on the back as he appears in LEGO form. The box design hasn&rsquo;t changed from the overall Marvel Super Heroes Theme aside from the character specific artwork on the front and back. Still a sharp looking design and fully serviceable.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: A single manual folded up is what you&rsquo;ll find here. On top of that there will be a sticker sheet in this set for the details on the model; the manual&rsquo;s step-by-step build is very well done and there is a really nice image in the pack showing off all of the stones and which set they can be found in. Overall a great looking package. I miss the included comics though.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a relatively small set with few parts to speak of for the ship, however this set includes four of the Space Stone on a little sprue so you can begin to collect your LEGO Infinity Stones.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Black Widow: This is her new blonde look, which is a very nice and unique looking design. She has a highly detailed print with a lot of belts and straps on her legs and a dual-sided torso with a new costume for her to wear. Some sort of zippered combat vest which is a nice change. She includes two lightsaber blades for some sort of Escrima sticks, similar to Nightwing and her face has two separate expressions, determined and regular everyday smiles. Her hair piece is blonde.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Captain America: Cap has lost his shield and gained two gauntlets which he now has for battle. His costume seems to be a minor variant from his Civil War garb, the detailing is different, but it&rsquo;s still a dark blue suit with the star on his chest. He&rsquo;s also grown a beard and both facial expressions showcase a healthy amount of facial hair, speaking of hair, his hair piece seems to be a new sculpt.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Outrider: Both of these little monstrosities serve Thanos and invade Wakanda at the end of the movie. They are built identically and feature identical prints; introducing and employing a new neck bracket element with bars on it allows you to make spider-like creatures with multiple limbs. The skeleton arm piece in black is used to add two sets of extra arms, sadly they fail to include any weapons to use, which since both of them are flying a little ship seems to be acceptable in a sense.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build &amp; The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is smaller so I shall combine the discussions. The build for this model is very simple and clean, really quick and easy to construct and features stickers to be applied on flag elements and 2x4 tiles for detailing and markings.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The model itself is a great looking little assault craft which uses the LEGO Friends method of attaching Minifigures, instead of attaching to studs they slide into the 1x2 element with the groove for legs allowing you to quickly place the two Outriders in or remove them to leap and attack the heroes. The front includes two stud-shooters for offensive capabilities.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is an excellent little battle pack and unless you&rsquo;d prefer to buy yours off Bricklink you need all of the Infinity War sets for the Infinity Stones and all of the characters seen in the movie. That being said I would recommend this set even if you didn&rsquo;t need it for the Space Stone because the model is fun looking and unique in design, the action features are much better implemented than the Iron Man vs Ultron set from Age of Ultron and it is overall a vast improvement for a Battle Pack style set in the Infinity War range. Strongly recommended.</p>

"Wendigo1","2019-11-15T01:20:17.183Z","Is it a super secret dropship?","<p>So making a foray into the Infinity War theme, it the&nbsp;76101-1: Outrider Dropship Attack up next. Is this little army builder worth it? Let&#39;s find out.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: For this set there are two unique variants of some well-represented characters and two nameless Outriders.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steve Rogers has been in numerous sets, both MCU and comic inspired versions. This version shows his tattered and torn uniform after being on the run for the intervening years after the Civil War. He&#39;s grown out his beard and hair, losing the clean cut look he&#39;s been known for. He&#39;s lacking the traditional shield, instead carrying two claws to represent the Wakandan&nbsp;versions from the movie. Honestly, the torso is great, legs are ordinary, and the head and hair are terrible. The beard and hair don&#39;t match and the printed beard looks awful. Honestly, a separate beard piece would&#39;ve worked and looked better. The bad look was why I didn&#39;t buy this set until it was on sale.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Natasha Romanoff&nbsp;has also been in many MCU sets, with looks varying in the myriad ways that Black Widow has changed over the years. This version has her usual face with a blonde hairpiece. She&nbsp;has a green line suit, printed all over the torso and the front of the legs. She&#39;s carrying two trans blue rods commonly used as lightsabers&nbsp;to represent her stun rods. It&#39;s a pretty good figure for the set, though this face has never really been a great one for Widow.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two Outriders from Thanos&#39;s&nbsp;invasion force round out the set. They&#39;re identical. They have intricately printed faces and torsos, but the legs are plain black. Unfortunately the new bracket for the extra arms covers the back printing. The extra arms are made by attaching angled pieces to the bracket to simulate the six arms each Outrider has. They are depicted as mindless, savage&nbsp;beasts and the face is an unsuccessful attempt at showing the snarling face of these creatures.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ultimately, for a theme centered on figures, this is not a successful grouping for me.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: The dropships are massive in the movie, so it&#39;s difficult to show them at scale in LEGO. This was actually a pretty fun build, with the various colored pieces coming together in a surprising way as the ship came together. The stickers actually play really well on the two wings, melding perfectly into the pieces.&nbsp;This version carries both Outriders, while the movie had seemingly thousands in each ship.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set comes with one of the six Infinity&nbsp;Stones scattered in each set, with the one that started off the infinity saga in the movies: the blue Space Stone. It was a clever (but expensive) way to give a reason to buy each set to complete the Infinity Gauntlet.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value: I grabbed this set on sale, though even at the RRP it&#39;s not a bad deal. Honestly, the figures are supposed to be the draw, but they&#39;re either common, boring or deeply flawed. I really can only recommend this set to complete the theme and gauntlet. There are just better options in this series.&nbsp;</p>

First off, I&#39;ll look at the minifigures. Captain America, in my opinion, looks amazing in the redesign, with his beard and hair piece. I also think that the new weapons he got for this set are really cool and as accurate to the movie as it is possible to get. The new head piece looks really cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Outriders look really cool, and the neck piece with the bracket to attach four skeleton arms in black is really useful.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Black Widow is an awesome minifigure, and the fact that she is exclusive to such an inexpensive set is really good, because it means that more people can get her. The Space Stone is also exclusive to this set, which means that if you&#39;re getting the Infinity War sets for the stones, this is a great way to get one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Dropship itself is a really cool and surprisingly accurate ship, although the stud blasters are not really that accurate to the film.Nonetheless, they are a cool action feature.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To wrap things up, I will say that my overall thoughts on the set are that it is a good collectors&#39; set if you&#39;re trying to get the full Infinity War collection like I am.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;The dropship: A complete-looking model,(for a small set like this) and it uses some very cool dark turquoise pieces. The sides of the ship open out, and they have a nice stripe down the side that uses a sticker (that looks like a tornado?). Two more stickers are on small fins near the back, and under the fins&nbsp;there are one each<b>&nbsp;</b>bar holder with clip&nbsp;in pearl gold. I guess these are here to keep the fins at an angle. Two stud shooters on the front provide a way to attack, (but not a very accurate one) and two extra 1x1 plates are included. The interior is rather cramped, and it uses two<b>&nbsp;</b>Panel 1 x 2 x 1 with Rounded Corners and Center Divider to&nbsp;keep the Outriders in place, and two slopes in between. On one side there is a jumper plate to keep the infinity stone on its stand, and on the other, there is a control panel sticker. Two big curved windscreens are on either side, which could be used for many things.&nbsp;LEGO seems to advertise the fact that it can open on all sides on the box and instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;Captain America: I&#39;ve never watched Infinity War, so I wouldn&#39;t&nbsp;know how this minifigure compares to the guy in the movie, But the minifigure looks great, with a really cool torso and dual-sided head. The bad things would be that he has un-printed legs, which look plain next to the torso, and his shields don&#39;t look very accurate. (The beard might look funny&nbsp;at first, because it&#39;s darker than his hair, but it looks good if his hair is positioned right.)</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;Black Widow: This minifigure also looks great, with printed legs and a tactical vest sort of thing in sand green on her torso, as well as a nice new hair piece. According to a response to a review on shop.lego.com that says her hair is the wrong color, LEGO says she is wearing a wig as a disguise. She uses Jyn Erso&#39;s head which is dual-sided and looks good, and she&nbsp;comes with two transparent light blue 1x4 bar pieces as weapons, and they look good, but I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re supposed to look like.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;Outriders: These things look very intimidating, with six arms (that fit in the ship!)&nbsp;and creepy head prints, (where are the eyes?) and very cool torso prints, the only downside is un-printed legs, which look plain. They have no weapons.</p>

<p>Also included are a round sprue (that is exactly 3x3 studs)&nbsp;with four trans-blue infinity stones (that you break off), and a stand to hold one.</p>

<p>I recommend this set, it is a great way to get some cool minifigures and parts.</p>

It can stand two minifigures.&nbsp; The outriders have what looks like a gold muscle print on the chest, and another gold generic faceless robot print on the head.&nbsp; But both are well done.&nbsp; They also have a backpack&nbsp;which holds six robotic arms.&nbsp; Black widow has a very intricate spy-suit&nbsp;print, both front and back on the chest, but only on the front on the legs.&nbsp; Her head is flesh tone with two expressions, angry and calm.&nbsp; She also comes with a nice blond hair piece, but one that seem a bit generic.&nbsp; Captain america chest&#39; has his costume print.&nbsp; His face has two bearded prints.&nbsp; One i&#39;m going to call happy and the other determined.&nbsp; He has a light brown hair piece&nbsp;(also pretty generic, both are still good molds though)&nbsp; He has two climbing claws.&nbsp; I will say if the suit was yellow and black you mistake this for a Wolverine minifig.</p>
