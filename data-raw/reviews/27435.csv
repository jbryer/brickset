<p>This isn&#39;t a perfect set but it is still pretty awesome</p>

<p><strong>Mini-figures</strong></p>

<p>Thor Odinson&nbsp;had a pretty rough couple of days at the hands of Hela, his rebel&nbsp;sister&nbsp;in Thor: Ragnarok but he is still alive and seemingly more powerful, even without Mjolnir. Thor&nbsp;loses an eye but the mini-figure&nbsp;still has two, probabaly&nbsp;because LEGO doesn&#39;t want to spoil Ragnarok. Thor is simpler now than before but that reflects his new outfit in Avengers: Infinity War&nbsp;perfectly. The hair piece is perfect and The head is still cool with the powered up eyes. The new POWER BURST pieces are awesome!!!! They look so good when connected to Thor. The Storm-Breaker (Ax Hammer thingy) is pretty cool also. This figure is great</p>

<p>Rocket Raccoon is identical to the GOTG2&nbsp;version but still good figure and the tail is a cool piece.</p>

<p>Teen Groot is pretty cool and the head mold is new. The prints are good but leg printing would have made this so much better, but he is still awesome!!</p>

<p><strong>The Escape Pod</strong>&nbsp;is a pretty cool ship. It has lots of sand blue pieces. All 3 mini-figures can fit inside and not be too crammed. Very cool color scheme with lots of rare pieces. The stud-shooters work great as always. The best feature by far is the ability to connect to the ship from Thanos: Ultimate Battle. It looks great when they are connected. So this is a great little ship with cool features and pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Space Forge</strong>&nbsp;is pretty neat and the features are nice. You can spin the electricity thing. There is a drawer that Strom-Breaker&nbsp;can pop out of. And of course the POWER STONE!!!! The new Infinity Stone elements are great and you get 4 in each set.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong>&nbsp;this is another great Infinity War set and I definitely recommend this.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>3 figures are included in this $20 set: Thor, Rocket Raccoon, and Teenage Groot, all of which make total sense for this particular scene. Rocket Raccoon is a reused minifigure from the GOTG2 Ravager Attack set. Teenage Groot features a brand new head mold. He has pretty good torso printing, but once again, no leg printing, making the whole figure look rather plain. Thor, the main character in the set, looks very plain. The face print is reused from the Rangarok sets, which I am fine with, although I don&#39;t care for the main expression. The torso has okay printing on the front, but the back looks extra plain with only gray being used for printing. Leg printing would have helped this figure greatly. The figure comes with his new Stormbreaker hammer which I personally really like. The only thing I don&#39;t like about it is the anti-stud on the Mjolnir half of the hammer. He also includes a set of trans-light blue Power Bursts. A total of four purple Power Stones are&nbsp;included as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed models:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think that the escape pod build looks pretty good overall. All 3 figures can comfortably fit inside. It looks fairly accurate to what we see in Avengers: Infinity War. The fins on the side are&nbsp;not angled, but they did try to give us the simulation of angles. The model is equipped with two stud shooters, is very detailed and uses several nice stickers making it look good from both the front and back.&nbsp;It also connects with the Guardian&#39;s Ship from the &quot;Thanos: Ultimate Battle&quot; set. It is fairly easy to connect and is very secure. I would definitely recommend getting both of these sets to connect together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The side build is supposed to be part of the place&nbsp;where Thor&nbsp;forged&nbsp;the Stormbreaker&nbsp;but does not represent any exact thing from the movie. There are some left over Power Burst pieces used to good effect, the center one being able to be spun around.&nbsp;There is a drawer you&nbsp;can push forward to reveal the Stormbreaker. (that&#39;s not exactly how it happened in the movie)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final verdict:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is a pretty good set. Not the best play value, but I think that&nbsp;the pretty good looking Escape Pod and 3&nbsp;important characters (good or not) makes it worth the&nbsp;$20.</p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2018-05-29T22:13:54.383Z","This is what happens when the Avengers don't stick together when trying to fight an unbeatable foe!","<p>Woo! We&#39;re halfway through the line of Infinity War sets! I&#39;m glad to have all you to follow my journey and read these reviews. This time, we&#39;ll be looking at Thor&#39;s Weapon Quest, which connects to the ship that vaguely resembles the Milano from the first two Guardians of the Galaxy movies. Is this set as good as the previous ones I&#39;ve reviewed so far? Let&#39;s dive in!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box and Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>If you have read my previous reviews, you know that I&#39;m a big fan of the artwork on the boxes. What I failed to tell you is that each design is very different, featuring various different locations from the movie (I won&#39;t name them to avoid spoilers for this movie). The instructions should be pretty easy to follow and mine were in better shape than the last set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Figures:</strong></p>

<p>This set contains 3 figures, all are pretty good. First, is Rocket. If you own one Rocket, you&#39;ve pretty much seen them all, which a few changes in color for his suit or a change in gun style to mix it up a bit. Next is Thor. Thor has a new costume that is almost entirely black, with some shading of various blues to represent thunder emanating from it. His hairpiece is nice, but his new weapon looks absolutely pathetic! (I honestly think they could&#39;ve done something different for it) Lastly is Groot. This is my favorite figure of the set, after seeing how Groot&nbsp;has progressed through the movies and sets, from a hulking giant, to an adorable baby and now an angsty&nbsp;teenager. The print looks marvelous on him and the head piece is amazing, showing how well Lego can sculpt molds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build is very easy, and should only take a couple of minutes if you&#39;re a fast or experienced builder. I prefer to take my sweet time, but that might be me. My only recommendation is try not to skip to bag 2 too hastily, as if one does that, all the pieces get muddled together, making it hard to dig through whatever storage system you use for the bricks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pod itself is very tiny and cute. But don&#39;t underestimate its size, as it can hold 3 passengers at once. However, what&#39;s even better is if you connect it to the&nbsp; ship that bears a semblance to the Milano, making both ships look more complete and whole than either ship independently. The side build is interesting, but doesn&#39;t really depict the forge in which Thor makes his new weapon from. This set contains the Power Stone.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Thoughts:</strong></p>

<p>Like the last set I reviewed, this is a cheap set with awesome figures and another Infinity Stone. While I agree the ship does look nice by itself, it looks even better when connected to the other ship in the wave, adding to the appearance of both. The forge is a bit of a disappointment, but with the limited amount of pieces in the set, it is easy to understand why the Forge looks pathetic. I recommend you get this set, no matter your budget, although if you have the extra cash, go out and get the Thanos: Ultimate Battle to make each set much better. I also recommend this set to people, whether they like Marvel movies or not, as the Pod and most other sets in this wave are fairly generic and can be modded easily if you want it to be more personal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for reading my review. I&#39;ll hope to see you soon ;)</p>

I probably would not have bought it at all but I had already got the ship it attaches to. The ship did not seem complete without it. Now that I have them both it feels like a complete set and I an very satisfied with the end result.</p>

And these sets are much harder to come by now that most of them have been retired. I&rsquo;m still trying to track down a Corvus Glaive set. But anyway, I digress, let&rsquo;s discuss the 25$ price point, Thor&rsquo;s Weapon Quest.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is the final year of red Marvel Super Heroes boxes, 2018 still featured red boxes, 2019 seems to have evolved into a new packaging design for the first time in almost a decade. This shows off some impressive action shots of the contents of the set, this is also one of the only sets from Infinity War not to include a villain character of any kind.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is still easy enough to follow along with, for the most part. Some of the pages in a few of these Super Heroes sets had miscoloured elements being used during the build steps, which caused a few instances of confusion on my part. I don&rsquo;t recall noticing any in this particular set, but it seems to be an odd printing error for LEGO to make when their manuals have been consistently top of the line for quite some time now.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There is an interesting idea with LEGO Marvel Super Hero sets, new elements have been introduced for the express purpose of simulating energy effects. I believe it started with the 2018 sets, but I could be wrong. These elements are highly effective, ah yes one of the Infinity Stones is also found in this set&hellip; er, I do not know what the purple stone is, I think it&rsquo;s the Nether or whatever it was called in Thor The Dark World, so, the Reality Stone? Either way, that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;ll find in this set aside from the plates, bricks and tiles that are also included.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Groot: He is Groot, a Teenage version and highly sought after, there was even a Polybag keychain giveaway with this particular Minifigure.

He holds a vine for an accessory out of brown plastic, love the details on this Minifigure, just the highlight of this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Rocket: This version of Rocket still has his Ravager style outfit, or at least a modified costume of a similar nature to that outfit. He&rsquo;s carrying a blaster too, but the best thing is he&rsquo;s got a very toothy grin on his face this time around, making him look like he&rsquo;s really loving attacking everybody.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Thor: The Mighty God of Thunder has lost much of his way, and yet he is still powerful enough to launch electricity from his hands, as evidenced by the numerous energy elements that are given to this Minifigure. He can hold them using the clip with stud holding item to attach elements to Minifigures hands. His print features the same face as the Thor Ragnarok sets with the glowing eyes on one side and the smirking smile on the other. His torso is fairly similar to past Thor Minifigures, it is interesting to see he has no cape here. And bare arms.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Rocket is back to help build a piece of the ship, not The Milano this time around, but a small escape craft used during the course of Infinity War. It is meant to attach to the model found in Thanos: Ultimate Battle, so this craft&rsquo;s build is kept simple and aesthetically matches the other model. Stickers are used for detailing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Thor and Groot join forces to add the tail, roof and other remaining touches to the ship. You also build a small forge for Thor&rsquo;s new weapon, this build is relatively simple as well, nothing tricky or difficult in this build. Which makes sense for a set of this size and price range.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Thor&rsquo;s Stormbreaker Forge: This model allows Thor to use the Infinity Stone in the set to create Stormbreaker&hellip; Hmmm, I don&rsquo;t recall that part of the movie. Didn&rsquo;t a large Dwarf help him? Oh well, this tiny model uses some of the energy elements and is a decent side build, but it is not the reason for getting this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Guardian&rsquo;s Shuttle Pod: This funky looking space craft can seat two, it is made with a lot of Orange colours as well as teal and grey. This set is meant to attach to the larger ship. Which is why it can only seat two, Rocket and Groot sit inside while Thor can hang out in the larger ship, since Drax, Nebula and Mantis are missing. Stud Shooters are added for a play feature, but there are no enemies in this set to fire against. Perhaps you can take some Outriders and let them be targeted instead.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a great set which is really hard to find now that it has Retired. I would strongly suggest tracking it down though, because it has an Infinity Stone, the awesome Teen Groot and a great looking model. Also the Guardian&rsquo;s Ship in the larger Thanos set is incomplete without this pod to attach to the back. Infinity War has a lot of great sets, in fact there weren&rsquo;t really any stinkers amongst them, I highly recommend the lot, especially if you can still get any of them at a discount from retail.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Highly Recommended.</p>

"Faefrost","2019-01-23T02:32:25.633Z","A fun little add on set with great figs","<p>This is a nice self contained little Infinity Wars set which offers up three must have minifigs. Has a nice little Spaceship. And is an add on to the much bigger Guardian&#39;s Ship set. So not many negatives at all.</p>

<p>Box/Instructions - It shows the little pod and it&#39;s stalwart crew of spacefarers journeying to make Thor a new Hammer. Not much to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts - Some good stuff. Lots of slopes and wedges. The most interesting is this is likely the first set you get that has the new minifigure&nbsp;Effects Parts. The assorted trans clear flames, blasts and whirls that can make them look like they are flinging around spellfire and laser bolts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs&nbsp;- there are three great ones here.</p>

<p>Thor - We have Thor in his black outfit with glowy blue disks. He has a double sided head with one his normal face and the other his Lightning God face. He has a nice brick built Stormbreaker.</p>

<p>Rabbit - The diminutive member of the Guardians of the Galaxy looks great in his blue guardians uniform with brown trim. Double sided torso printing. Short legs and bushy tail. he has a slightly open mouthed expression and carries a big gun as always.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tree - This is the first time we have ever gotten a true &quot;minifig&quot; version of &quot;tree&quot; and he looks wonderful. Representing the adolescent treelord&nbsp;at about human size. Previously we had the brickbuilt giant version and the tiny Baby versions. he has a custom molded hard plastic head and front and back printing. He also carries some brown vine pieces to represent how he attacks and when he creates the handle to Stormbreaker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build/Model - The main build is two parts. The first being the small Space Pod. It is remarkably roomy for such a small ship and seats all three figures perfectly. It is also a fully contained spaceship with no glaring open walls. It&#39;s a little stubby but swooshable. It&#39;s also worth noting that it docks with and becomes part of the larger Ravager ship that comes in the Thanos Showdown set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second build is the Forge of Nidavellir. The forge of the Asgardian Dwarves who crafted Thor&#39;s Hammer and the Infinity Gauntlet itself. In the movie the forge is the size of a planet and channels the power of a star. In this set? Not so much. But it does have a neat spinny effect part and can spit the hammer out from a drawer in the bottom. So Play feature! Yeah, I don&#39;t think anyone will be entertained by the forge for long.</p>

<p>Overall - It&#39;s a great little set. The only thing lacking is an Eitri&nbsp;Big Fig. Don&#39;t look at me like that. You know you really want a BigFig&nbsp;of Peter Dinklage!&nbsp;</p>

"vikings","2019-01-07T03:46:12.993Z","Another Great Infinity War Set","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a small-medium sized box. The dimensions of the box are 10.3 x 7.5 x 1.8 inches and weighs around 0.73 pounds. Comes with a small-medium sized instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parts:</b></p>

<p>You get some decent parts in this set. You get the blue energy pieces used in the forge and as lightning energy for Thor. You also get the power stone in the set as well. The grey blue and orange pieces were also really nice to get as well. You get 8 stickers with this set. 6 are on the ship and 2 are on the forge. The total piece count is 223 pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigures:</b></p>

<p><b>Thor:</b></p>

<p>Thor has a doubled sided head. On one side is his normal face and on the other you get him with his electricity in his eyes ready for battle. Thor has a new hair piece for the first time. It is a dark tan or blonde. His printing on his torso is his new armor which is really cool, and he has plain black legs. He comes with Stormbreaker (which I am not a huge fan of the design). I wish it was bigger (like in the movie). It still looks good but to small for my liking.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Groot:</b></p>

<p>This is my favorite figure of the entire set. Getting minifigure sized Groot is amazing and makes the entire set worth it. He has a custom Groot head, which is new. He has printing on both sides of his torso showing vines, leaves, and tree like material. He has plain brown legs and has a brown vine as a weapon.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Rocket:</b></p>

<p>Rocket is my least favorite figure from the set. I am not of fan of the facial expression he has. The armor connected to the head is cool. He has front and back printing on his torso of a jacket. He has short dark blue legs. He has a gun with a dark orange cylinder on the front of it. I would have liked a better gun for Rocket, given that he usually has these really cool&nbsp;pistols or heavy blasters. It would have been nice to have seen them give&nbsp;more effort to creating a cool customized gun for him.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:</b></p>

<p>The build had two parts to it the ship and then the forge. The forge is small and isn&#39;t overly big and took me&nbsp;less than 5 minutes to build. The ship took longer around 15-20 minutes for me to build. It was a quick and easy build taking me less than 30 minutes to build altogether. The ship connects to the larger one in set 76107 (which I own) and looks very good together. Overall a relatively short and easy build.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall this is a really well done set. It is another great infinity war set to add to your MCU or Lego collection. The figures are really great, getting a minifigure scale Groot and Thor with his new hair and armor are really cool. Rocket is ok, they could have done a better job on his gun as well as picking a better facial expression. The builds are both well done. The ship is great and you can fit all 3 figures into it at once. You get a pair of stud shooters as the only weapons on it.The forge is really cool and uses some of the&nbsp;blue energy used as lightning for Thor. You get the Power Stone as the infinity for this set. This all meshes well together creating a nice well-rounded set. I highly recommend getting this, especially if you are a fan of Marvel. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"jdm","2019-01-03T00:35:00.263Z","Nice little set","<p>This set represents the part of the film when Thor, Rocket and Groot separate from some of the other Avengers in order to journey to Nadavellir to seek out a new weapon for Thor. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Having already bought the larger set &lsquo;Thanos: Ultimate Battle&rsquo; this smaller set was a must get really, to be able to slot it into the larger set.&nbsp; As well as to continue collecting the infinity stones of course!</p>

<p>The whole build is a leisurely 30 minutes and is not overly complicated.&nbsp; The first part is a mini build representing a very scaled down version of the forge which ultimately makes Thors&rsquo; new axe.&nbsp; It is not particularly interesting as a build but does add playability to the set and completes the story that the set is depicting.&nbsp; It makes nice use of the new power burst elements.</p>

<p>The second build is the space pod.&nbsp; Again it is not a complex construction as you would probably expect from a set of this size but the overall result is in my opinion very well designed.&nbsp; There is nice use of grey, sand blue and orange and everything slots together neatly to make a very solid and polished looking spaceship.&nbsp; The front semi-spherical windscreen looks great and the pod fits 2 minifigs with ease.&nbsp; Furthermore it fits really snugly into the &lsquo;mother&rsquo; ship (aka M-ship) to enhance it nicely as well as accurately reflecting its ability to de-couple from the M-ship as it does in the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs are great. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Rocket and Groot look amazing.&nbsp; They have captured the facial expressions brilliantly well - Rocket with his snarling sarcastic smile, and Groot with a typically teenager grumpy/not interested look.&nbsp; Thor is not entirely accurate since he had previously lost one eye which is not reflected here, but the torso printing is excellent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall it&rsquo;s not a particularly big set, and I would have perhaps felt a little short changed if I&rsquo;d paid the full 25 euros asking price. However it&rsquo;s well worth picking up if you can find it at a discount.&nbsp;</p>

It includes a small spaceship, a side build, and 3 minifigures. It was released in 2018 for $19.99 and has 223 pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><strong>Thor- </strong>Great minifigure for Thor with short hair and has a new weapon called Stormbreaker. 10/10&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rocket Raccoon-</strong> Same version as&nbsp;the one from the Guardians of the Galaxy 2 sets but still is nice. 9/10</p>

<p><strong>Teen Groot- </strong>Great new version of Groot that has a new head piece. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The spaceship is a nice small build for a set this size. It doesn&#39;t have much playability but it can connect with the&nbsp;Thanos: Ultimate Battle set. The side build is small but is a nice addition. Overall the builds are ok but they are not that good. 7/10</p>

"Puidwen","2020-03-20T09:51:43.033Z","A very nice set, with some tiny problems.","<p>For the most part building this set is super easy.&nbsp; The two major problems I had with it were:</p>

<p>1. Sometimes the bricks just don&#39;t want to quite align.</p>

<p>2. Once again the colours in the instructions can be misleading at times.</p>

<p>The set&nbsp;itself looks very nice, although the attachment points on the pod to attach&nbsp;it to the Benatar&nbsp;can be a bit distracting.&nbsp; I will say whenever I pick up the pod, the roof has a tendency to want to fall off.&nbsp; Coming back to this later I think I just didn&#39;t have it snap tight.&nbsp; Unless you take the roof off Rocket is very hard to position in the pod.&nbsp; All the parts are for most part just your normal fare, although I am quite fond of the translucent lightning parts.</p>

<p>Thor and Rocket have awesome chest prints.&nbsp; Rocket isn&#39;t very poseable, you can&#39;t turn his head, and he uses the children leg parts.&nbsp; His tail is a bit too long, so you have to sit him on a ledge.&nbsp; Thor also has two nice face prints.&nbsp; I had a bit of trouble getting his hair on, which only just covers the second print.&nbsp; If you use the larger lightning blasts you will have to sit him on a plate or something because he becomes too top heavy to stand on his own.</p>

"Vikn","2021-02-20T13:36:44.4Z","A good set and amazing addon","<p>This is a very quick and easy set to review.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By itself, this is a good small sized set, just solid overall but not amazing.</p>

<p>However, this is an amazing addon to the Thanos Ultimate Battle set. I&#39;d go as far as to say it&#39;s 100% necessary to get if you have the larger set. The forge is pretty trivial. The small ship attaches to the back of the&nbsp;Guardian&#39;s ship from the Thanos Ultimate Battle and, despite it&#39;s small size, really bulks up and fills out the larger vehicle. Between the two sets you get four of the original Guardians (barring Drax). The combination of the two sets make for my favorite Marvel build overall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, if I see the Guardian&#39;s ship without the additional pod it looks very incomplete. So basically, this is a must have if you own or plan to get the ultimate battle. By itself it&#39;s fine, just not worth any pains to obtain.&nbsp;</p>
