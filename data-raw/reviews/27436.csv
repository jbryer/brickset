"I_am_Groot","2018-05-18T22:10:25.78Z","Poor figures, okay builds","<p>This set includes 5 minifigs, which is a good amount for a $40 set. However, it seems that they have gone for quantity over quality. First of all, the Outrider is pretty good aside from not having leg printing. Vision&nbsp;and Black Pather&nbsp;are both&nbsp;reused figures that still have room for improvements. Shuri is not that accurate compared to the Infinity War version. The hair is wrong and the arms should be exposed. Corvus Glaive was one of my favorite characters from Infinity War, so I&#39;m sad to see that he is one of the worst Marvel Figures to date. The hood should have DEFINITELY been a new mold with his signature gold horns. Also, the lack of leg printing feels very lazy&nbsp;makes me mad.&nbsp;The torso, cape,&nbsp;and face work out pretty well though.</p>

<p>The Thresher definitely looks different than in the movie, but I still think it gets the point across.&nbsp;The mechanism does not work as well as I would like. The Wakandan wall looks pretty decent from the outside, but the inside feels like the designer worked on it for 5 minutes. The play value is just okay. There is a bed on te inside that can be raised up by hitting a 4x4 round dish piece with the Thresher, a disk shooter, 4 stud shooters, and a sliding door feature which works fine.There is not that much room for figures.&nbsp;Also I do want to point out that every single sticker in this set is clear-backed, making them extremely difficult to apply.</p>

<p>Overall, I think the build and&nbsp;minifigures could have easily been done a whole lot better. I like the Wakandan Wall from the outside, but sadly that the only positive thing I have to say.</p>

She is certainly one of the fan favorites from the Black Panther film, but I felt like her minifg was kind of plain. It just didn&rsquo;t seem to be a great representation of her. The face, the attire, the hair, the battle gloves&hellip;it was all a bit underwhelming and felt like it missed the mark representing her. I think they should have gone with her battle attire and done a better hair piece to make her more identifiable. </span></span></span></span></p>

The set is beautiful on display and goes well with the Marvel LEGO line. The build is not particularly difficult, but the detail and included play functions make it a neat overall project. Taking into account the minifigs and piece count I think this was a great value set. I would recommend this set to collectors of the Marvel line, builders looking to create unique MOCs, and parents looking for an affordable and playable LEGO set. </span></span></span></span></p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2019-01-19T18:28:59.6Z","Walls are always a great method of defense, unless you get attacked by orbital bombardment!","<p>To me, this is set is a very interesting phenomenon. I, like many, was originally skeptical of this set, believing that this set was lacking something that the other sets had. However, after having built this set, I was pleasantly surprised by this and my viewpoint has changed somewhat. However, I will still be critical on aspects that I think could be changed as this is an analysis after all. Now, I suppose I should begin the review.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong>This set offers a plethora of minifigures&nbsp;and perhaps this is a saving grace of this set. First up we have Black Panther which is a repeat of the figures in the Black Panther sets released earlier that year. To some that may be a disappointment, but to me, that is fine given that his outfit doesn&#39;t change all that much during Infinity War. Like Aquaman and Lloyd from the Lego Ninjago Movie, he has a slightly reflective pattern that can be seen in certain light conditions. Next we have Vision, which is also a repeat, but I don&#39;t mind that because like Black Panther, he does&nbsp;not change all that much during Infinity War. I like how his cape is somewhat reflective on one side and how the sand green matches well with the vibrant pick color. Next we have Shuri, the hilarious sister of Black Panther. I really like how this figure turned out. I think the orange jacket works really well for her scenes in Infinity War. I think her hairpiece works decently well for her but perhaps they could have made a new mold for her or something? I just feel like the hairpiece doesn&#39;t match the actor too well. Though, I do love the intricate detailing and molding on it. I think her gauntlets (?) work pretty well as it would be really hard to make a spitting - image of the gauntlets she uses in the movie. Next we have an Outrider, which is a nice army builder. They&#39;re relatively common, appearing in about four out of the six sets in the wave and once you&#39;ve seen one, you&#39;ve kind of seen them all. They&#39;re not really accurate to the movie, but they do have a really interesting Alien design and they sure look better than the Chi&#39;tauri in 2011 but I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll make better Chi&#39;tauri&nbsp;in Endgame if they don&#39;t re-use the&nbsp;outriders, Finally we have Corvus&nbsp;Glaive. I think they did a really great job with his head, his black tattered cape (Which will be really useful for custom figures) as well as his staff weapon. I think he could&#39;ve really used more printing around and his hood is not really accurate, but I&#39;m not really sure how they could&#39;ve improved on either.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The build:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The build should be pretty easy and does not involve too many complicated techniques. The stickers are a pain, as always, but they do provide more detail to the set, ven if it&#39;s almost impossible to align them perfectly. The hardest part of the set was trying to assemble the function for the door as it is really easy to mess that up if you&#39;re not paying enough attention to the instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The completed model:&nbsp;</strong>The completed model looks surprisingly nice on display, both with and without other sets in the line to accompany it. The &quot;Thrasher&quot; looks really nice by incorporating multiple shades of green to make it look more natural. I&#39;m still not sure about the functionality of it, but I&#39;m sure that it could be really fun to ram it against the fortress if you get the technique right. As for the fortitude itself, it looks relatively huge and could defend itself against multiple oncoming threats through the use of stud - shooters, a disc - launcher as well as the opening gate function, which works surprisingly well if put together right. Though I do wish that the build could incorporate a function that would allow the gate to be held in&nbsp;place somehow. The inside of the build is relatively hollow, but features storage for additional weapons as well as a place for Shuri&nbsp;to work as well as a workbench for Vision.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Thoughts:&nbsp;</strong>Overall, I think this a pretty nice set, providing both cool play - features and it looks really nice on display as well. Also, the set is fairly cheap, costing only $40.00 in the U.S. Also, for a set of its size, it&#39;s really nice of Lego to include 5 minifigures&nbsp;in a fairly cheap set because they typically reserve that for more expensive sets, but from time to time, they put a lot of figures in fairly cheap and obtainable sets. Also, this set has another Infinity stone, so it&#39;s really nice to those who want to collect all the stone. Overall, if you really like Lego Marvel Superheroes, want a set that looks nice on display and is packed with features or looking for a fairly cheap structure set with awesome figures, I highly recommend this set to you.&nbsp;</p>
