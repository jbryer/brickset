"xboxtravis7992","2018-03-17T15:54:04.98Z","Improved Iteration of the familiar Hulkbuster","<p>In 2015, Lego introduced its first take on the Hulkbuster suit based on the version seen in <em>Avengers: Age of Ultron</em>. The set was well regarded, and one of the popular sets of the year, so its no surprise Lego would revisit the idea again. 2017&#39;s Detroit Steel Strikes was a re-skinned remake of the 2015 Hulkbuster suit with a few changes.</p>

<p>The Hulkbuster suit though is making its cinematic reprise in the upcoming <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> coming out next month. Its no surprise that Lego would use the opportunity to release two new versions of the suit, a large UCS model based on the familiar Age of Ultron version, and a smaller playset version that is akin to the prior Hulkbuster and Detroit Steel sets. Fortunately, this new Hulkbuster is a proper remake that re-designs many of the original aspects of the model and removes the weakness that detracted from the prior iterations.<br />
<br />
<span style=""display: none;"">&nbsp;</span><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><em>Bruce Banner</em> has appeared before in the Thor: Ragnarok sets; but this is my first chance at getting the new figure. Its a long awaited character in Marvel, his Hulk form having appeared many times since 2012, but Bruce Banner not making his appearance until last year. Its kind of a plain figure, but that fits his mild mannered depiction in the films. The black jacket on the torso print will be useful to Lego builders looking for some good civilian clothes. The double-sided head has an &quot;angry&quot; side with large green eyes, showing Banner in the beginning stages of transforming into The Hulk.<br />
<br />
<em>Outrider</em> the new minion/mook army villain of the Infinity War wave. I like the new arm bracket piece, used to mount the four arms to the back in a slim compact manner, and the printing is pretty cool. This is though a rather common figure, appearing in several of the other Infinity War sets. It will be nice to get a small army of these guys, but they really aren&#39;t the focus of the sets.<br />
<br />
<em>Proxima Midnight </em>one of the member&#39;s of Thanos&#39;s Black Order, Proxima is a pretty cool figure. The hair piece is a striking new mold in hard plastic (not rubber!) with blue coloring and some painted black spikes up front. The figure&#39;s head is double-sided with an evil smirk and angry expressions. She has a weapon made out of a lightsaber bar with two blades attached to the opposite ends.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Falcon </em>I wasn&#39;t really expecting Falcon to be the highlight figure of the set for me, but he is. I have the prior Civil War version from 2016, and this new version makes several upgrades that I enjoy. The new double sided head has a &#39;goggle-less&#39; version of his face, which I am half tempted to steal from Falcon and put on a Black Panther figure instead. The body is cast in gunmetal colors, which gives it a nice pop compared to the normal bley colors used in the previous figure. What really sells this new version though is the upgraded wings... The previous Falcons used a series of pre-molded wings. They looked nice, but don&#39;t add any play value. The new Falcon takes inspiration from the 2017 Vulture figure from <em>Spider-Man Homecoming</em>, however while the Vulture&#39;s wings were big and bulky; the Falcon wings are much smaller, and about as small as you can get in Lego while retaining the playability. Its fun, even as a collector using the new wings to pose the Falcon &quot;in flight&quot; using some transparent strut pieces (ironically from the previous Hulkbuster set) to have him &quot;flying&quot; around my Lego collection. It looks, good, and Sam Wilson really draws attention with the wings!</p>

<p><strong>The Finished Model</strong></p>

<p>The set uses several new pieces, from the smooth plating to the diagonal plates. However the new piece that is catching everyone&#39;s eye, is the Infinity Stones. The infamous (for MCU fans at least) Soul Stone is included in this set. The stones come in a sprue ring, and the four stones can be twisted out of the ring. They don&#39;t pop off easily... and leave a sprue mark were the connection used to be, but due to the shape of the ring and the size of the stones,&nbsp;I don&#39;t think using a hobby knife or sprue cutter to get a cleaner cut would really be possible. But once off the sprue, the stones do look pretty good. The extra stones are usefully for both placing one on the included pedestal, saving one for the Infinity Gauntlet which is available in a larger set in the theme, and keeping the spares for MOC purposes.<br />
<br />
The first part built in the set is the turret. I really can&#39;t place my finger on what the turret is supposed to be... It looks cool; but its style sits somewhere between the dark colors of the Outrider&#39;s equipment and the regal black and purple of Wakanda (so is it a weapon for the good guys or the bad guys? I can&#39;t tell). The instructions suggest placing Proxima Midnight on the turret, but frankly it looks better with the Outrider (or even better with a character from Black Panther if you do want it to go the good guy route). It seems a bit in play with Lego&#39;s current strategy of including &quot;a battle in a box&quot; route. It does look pretty good though, and was a fun starter build. There is a nice function were a good smack to the front of the turret will cause it to tilt off the top too.<br />
<br />
The rest of the build is focused on the Hulkbuster, with only an interlude to build the Falcon&#39;s wings later on in the set. Boy, does this Hulkbuster look good. The unsightly gaps from the first Hulkbuster and Detroit Steel are gone now, instead the build is nearly seamless. A figure can be placed in the cockpit&nbsp;and be unseen once inside. The stickers bring some much needed detail to the set which the original Hulkbuster lacked, and plenty of new greebles are also in the build to further fill in the model with mechanical detail. The feet have toes, and the individual fingers remain from the first model.&nbsp;Overall, although&nbsp;the model is about the same height as the prior sets, it&nbsp;feels&nbsp;more complete, more stout and bulky just via the addition of&nbsp;the new pieces and redesigned cockpit&nbsp;area. The prior models were cool sets, but this one really looks more prepared to go &quot;mano a mano&quot; with the Hulk or similar threats. Visually, it has a lot of bang, and is a lot cheaper than the UCS model it is sharing shelf space with! More bang for the buck etc.<br />
<br />
The new play feature in the Hulkbuster will be familiar to any old Bionicle fans, its the&nbsp;Technic waving right arm of DOOM! The right arm can swing back and forth via a&nbsp;knob on the back. It uses smaller gears, and even uses the ring from the&nbsp;Lord of the Rings&nbsp;theme instead of a normal Technic spacer; so everything about the gear train is very compact and hidden. However this is more of a Bionicle Gen 1 type of gear train instead of the more friction heavy ones from the Bionicle Gen 2 sets; since the arm flops around when left to its own devices. Its a pity friction couldn&#39;t be included to keep the right arm more steady, and it limits the static poses that can be made with the model.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a great little set. The price at $30 seems fair, although I would have preferred to have gotten it for a bit cheaper. MCU fans will enjoy this set, as part of the hype building up the much anticipated <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>, and the&nbsp;inclusion of the little Infinity Stones will make the collector feel a bit like Thanos himself, gathering all the little pieces together while slowly buying up the Infinity War sets. The new Falcon is a great update to a previous figure, and the new Hulkbuster is visually stunning for its small size and has some fun playfeatures included.</p>

"rypo2020","2018-03-18T22:48:30.207Z","New and Improved Hulkbuster","<div>This new hulk-buster set is pretty cool and definitely an improvement over the last one in 2015.</div>

<div>Minifigures</div>

<div>Bruce Banner is the main hero in this set, but this figure is reused from the Thor: Ragnarok set. He still looks too young with the hair piece they chose.</div>

<div>Falcon (Sam Wilson)is the best mini-figure in this set by far. He looks so great and the new wing build is nice. His Head is new and it has a face with goggles for when he is in flight; the other face is great and has a new goggle-less head.</div>

<div>Proxima Midnight is a cool figure. I like this fig but I haven&#39;t really seen what she looks like in the movie.</div>

<div>Outrider is still cool but the same as in the other sets, which is fine. I think they have 4 arms in movie though, not 6</div>

<div>The Builds</div>

<div>The Wakandan Turret is cool. It can shoot the black spheres out and it can look broken. It also stores the Soul Stone, which in the movie is probably not powering a puny little turret. Overall a cool build</div>

<div>The HULK-BUSTER is pretty awesome!! it opens up differently than the last one but it looks better and uses lots of stickers to good effect. It still has lots of possibilities with the range of motion. Turning A knob on the back allows it to punch it arm out and smash the turret</div>

<div>Overall this set is really cool and for $25-ish USD at Walmart I&nbsp;definitely recommend it.</div>

"vikings","2020-01-02T07:28:49.28Z","Improved Hulkbuster","<p>This hulkbuster is a nice improvement from 2015 hulkbuster.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>The is medium size box. The dimensions of it are 8.7 x 10.3 x 2.4 in. and weighs 1.08 lbs. The instructions are the medium size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>There are few good parts in this set. The dome for the head of the hulkbuster is nice. Also getting a lot of maroon pieces was nice. Other than that there aren&#39;t any pieces that are unique. The total piece count for the set is 375.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>You get four minifigures in this set: Falcon, Bruce Banner, Proxima Midnight, and an Outrider.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Falcon:</strong></p>

<p>Falcon comes with a brick built wings. I personally like this more than the wings used in the civil war sets. There are four stickers that go on the wings. He has a double sided face. One is with his goggles on and the others without.&nbsp;He also has printing on both sides of his body and none on his legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bruce Banner:</strong></p>

<p>Bruce Banner is great figure to get in this set. This is his second appeareance in Lego. He has a double sided face. On normal and the other trying to turn into the hulk with his eyes turning&nbsp;green. His face is too young and should be older. Other than that he is a good figure. The printing of a jacket and shirt is really good.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Proxima Midnight:</strong></p>

<p>Proxima Midnight is really accurate to the version of her in the movie. The hair piece is really good with the blue hair and black horns. The printing and detail on the body is also really good and accurate. The left arm being gold and the right being white&nbsp;is great. There is no printing on her legs. My only problem is that the weapon is not correct. She should have been given her three prong spear&nbsp;instead of a double sided spike weapon. Other than this is a great figure to get.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Outrider:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The outrider is the same as all the others you get in the infinty war sets. It comes with 6 arms. It has printing on the body and none on the legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall all of these figures are really good.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was farily easy. It took me around 20-30 minutes to build. There are 16 stickers in this set (2 on the Wakanda Cannon, 4 on Falcon&#39;s wings, and 10 on the Hulkbuster).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:</strong></p>

<p>Once I finished building it I was very happy with the improvements of the hulkbuster. The legs and feet are really good. It is nice and sturdy. Nice improvment on the armor for the legs and feet. The main body is also really nice. Easier access to the inside of the hulkbuster. The front is really good from the older version. The arms and hands are okay. I wish they would have added some shoulder armor to it because it just looks exposed there without any. The right arm can be controlled by a dial on the back of it. It moves it up and down. This also makes the right arm hard to pose becuase it is so loose.&nbsp;Thankfully Lego made it so you can take a piece off the dial and lock it in place like the left arm (It shows which piece to remove in the insturctions). The Wakanda&nbsp;Cannon is okay. It would be better if it could rotate 360 degrees and move up. Besides that it is really good. There is a spot for a gunner to sit on it. On the back there is a place where you can store the soul stone.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a really good set. The improvments on the hulkbuster are really good. The armor and the look are great. The Wakanda cannon is also really good. Would have been nice for it to have had 360 degree rotation,&nbsp;but the cannon is still great. The minifigures are all great ones to get. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2019-01-19T17:22:20.64Z","It's Clobberin' Time!","<p>I realized that I have been getting a little lazy writing reviews for the sets I own, so I&#39;m going to start writing again just to get back into the habit. Anyways, enough of me rambling, today we&#39;ll be taking a look at the Hulkbuster&nbsp;Smash set from Avengers Infinity War.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong>This is always one of my personal favorite aspects to look at. First we have Bruce Banner, which is the same from that Thor Ragnarok set about a year ago. I think he personally could have benefited from a new hairpiece as well as a totally new outfit, but I understand sometimes Lego cna be cheap. At least his hair and torso is great for customs. Next we have Falcon and I absolutely love the brick built wings compared to the piece used from the Civil War sets. The hairpiece works well for him in my opinion and I love the face with one side showing the goggles and the other without the googles. I just wished they could include a pair of guns for him. Next is the Outrider and for some odd reason, I really like this army builder despite not being very accurate to the movie. Maybe it&#39;s the weird alien design and the introduction of the very useful neck bracket piece.&nbsp; Finally we have Proxima&nbsp;Midnight, which I think is a nice rendition of one of Thanos&#39; generals. I think the legs could&#39;ve benefited from leg printing and replacing the golden arm with a white one because to me, it&#39;s a little too bright compared to the other colors. Though I want to give props to the introduction of the very unique hairpiece for her. I think minifigure customizers&nbsp;will have lots of fun with it.</p>

<p><strong>The build:&nbsp;</strong>The build should be relatively easy for those who have spent a fair amount of time building with Lego before. The stickers are painful for those who dislike them but I understand stickers are often easier than making prints for pieces left and right.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The completed model:&nbsp;</strong>This is probably one of the better looking mechs Lego has made. Though I often admit that looks often interfere with posebility, but I wouldn&#39;t know because I haven&#39;t tried posing it much. However, the mech looks great when finished and you can fit a figure in with relative ease. The most intriguing function of the mech is to use the smashing feature one of the arms has that can be used to disable the turret included. The turret doesn&#39;t look terrible and is a decent side build, providing some opposition to the mech as well as a storage for the soul stone included with the set. Though to me, the turret kind of looks like Wakandan&nbsp;technology, so I&#39;m using the turret for the Wakandan&nbsp;side, but that&#39;s just personal opinion, so please use the turret how you wish.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Thoughts:&nbsp;</strong>I think that this mech is a wonderful additon to your Avenger&#39;s Infinity War collection, providing decent playability and great displayability&nbsp;for those who purchase it. Also, this set is among the cheaper ones in the Infinity War line, so it&#39;s&nbsp;great for those&nbsp;&nbsp;with a limited budget. Overall, I think that if you&#39;re an avid collector of Marvel superheroes or really like displayable Lego mechs&nbsp;or want a cheap yet playable superheroes set, this is a pretty good choice for you.&nbsp;</p>

"Collector_Nonas","2020-08-07T18:11:26.407Z","Ha, you guys are so screwed now!","<p><strong>First Look:</strong> We&#39;ve seen some Hulkbuster sets before, and we&#39;ve seen some after (this being a late review).&nbsp; This has got to be a favorite of mine.&nbsp; The original (76031) looks okay, the Ultron Edition (76105) looks great and very movie-accurate (but is designed&nbsp;to be so and cannot be compared to the smaller models), and&nbsp;the War Machine Buster (76124) is a very build-up, militarized version of this Hulkbuster.&nbsp; Finally, the Hulkbuster vs. Aim Agents set (76164) looks awful, but that&#39;s for another day.&nbsp; This Hulkbuster set (76104) has got to be a favorite <em>because</em> of its simple, sleek, generally movie-accurate design, its amazing price, and fantastic assortment of minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>Build:&nbsp;</strong>This Hulkbuster&#39;s build looks great.&nbsp; He&nbsp;feels solid in my hand and is very sturdy.&nbsp; I don&#39;t see him falling over easily, partly due to his&nbsp;wide feet and excellent weight distribution.&nbsp; I don&#39;t have much to say about his&nbsp;feet and legs, except that I love the combination of transparent blue highlights, gold details, and grey&nbsp;and red main pieces.&nbsp; This trend encompasses most of the design.&nbsp; I love the use of grey 1x2 locking pieces on the angle of the &ldquo;knees.&rdquo;&nbsp; Overall, the legs have a&nbsp;good range of motion, rotating all the way backward and all the way around until it hits the shoulder area.&nbsp; As far as mech arms go, I&#39;ve seen better, but they do have excellent stickers and can rotate all the way around.&nbsp; The body is simple and as movie-accurate as it could be at its size.&nbsp; I would have liked to see the closing part of the torso be more compact and less simple.&nbsp; Maybe LEGO could have made the sides longer?&nbsp; I also would have liked to see the transparent blue 1x1 tile piece in the very center be orange or yellow instead, maybe on top of a color other than grey; it sticks out too much but I can&#39;t think of a color that would look better.&nbsp; The printed face and sticker on the torso look excellent, very much like the film&#39;s suit.&nbsp; Let me provide one large complaint; I do not like how I can see so much in between the arms.&nbsp; I can see into the gears in the armpits and into the Hero Factory-style biceps.&nbsp; I wish LEGO had covered over them more, especially since the film version of this is very, very filled in.&nbsp; The action feature works fine, but the arm is very loose, and I find myself resting his hand on his right &ldquo;knee&rdquo; for stability.&nbsp; Only one hand is posable by itself; the other has to be held up with the wheel on the back.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Side-Build:&nbsp;</b>Finally, a side-build I actually use!&nbsp; The black cannon-type thing belonging to the Outriders looks very sleek and nice.&nbsp; I enjoy the angled shapes up from the bottom and unto the black flaps near the top.&nbsp; The black and white stickers, as well as the transparent purple 2x3 pentagonal tile, add great details to the build, and a layer of texture.&nbsp; The storage compartment works well for Infinity Stone storage and the Outrider can sit nicely on top of the cannon.&nbsp; Finally, the two action features work nicely.&nbsp; The main one, the collapsibility of the cannon, is meant to function with Hulkbuster&#39;s smashing arm; the arm is meant to&nbsp;smash the cannon.&nbsp; The other basic feature is obviously the cannon part on the front -- when squeezed, it shoots a single ball.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability:&nbsp;</strong>I&#39;ve been over most of the playability of this set, but to recap: Hulkbuster can be posed and used for any kind of smashing you desire, and his right arm works with the forces of gravity (and LEGO gears) to raise and thwart the enemy&#39;s cannon.&nbsp; The cannon can break, of course, and can fire back at Hulkbuster.&nbsp; Falcon&#39;s wings are nice, and I love how LEGO included &ldquo;Redwing&rdquo; on the back, which is only a few&nbsp;pieces but can be detached and imaginatively used for recon or fighting.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong>The minifigures from&nbsp;this set are beautiful!&nbsp; It&#39;s difficult to even decide on a favorite, but when I think about the minifigs here I am so excited.&nbsp; Banner is very simple, with no leg prints.&nbsp; His jacket looks completely fine; I&#39;m happy with it.&nbsp; His face is simple and unthreatening, like Banner&#39;s, but I wish it looks a bit more like Mark Ruffalo.&nbsp; His alternate face, however, looks very detailed and angry.&nbsp; It&#39;s a great mix of Hulk and Banner and reminds me of his half-transformation stage.&nbsp; His hair is a common black hairpiece.&nbsp; Falcon also looks great, with no leg prints and a mediocre torso print, but an excellent back print and faces.&nbsp; One face looks just like Sam Wilson with his flight goggles, and his alternate face is great as well, looking happy and very much in my opinion like Anthony Mackie.&nbsp; His hair is longer than Falcon&#39;s in the film, but in the film, it is too short to be a LEGO piece.&nbsp; Proxima Midnight is one of my favorite LEGO Marvel villains and one of my favorite LEGO villains overall!&nbsp; First, however, what is the deal with leg prints?&nbsp; I really wish LEGO had put a bit&nbsp;of effort into the legs.&nbsp; &nbsp;On the other hand, her torso and back make&nbsp;up for it completely.&nbsp; They are&nbsp;stunning, with excellent detail that looks exactly like the actress&#39; outfit, and the gold arm that transitions into the torso and back.&nbsp; Her face is also incredible, looking better in my opinion than even the actress&#39;.&nbsp; LEGO captured her facial shapes and expressions perfectly, on both her arrogant and angry faces.&nbsp; Her duel-molded blue hairpiece with horns is exclusive I believe, and it works perfectly with the character.&nbsp; The outrider is common and fine&nbsp;-- he serves his purpose well and is a great minifigure to play with.</p>

<p><strong>Falcon&#39;s Wings: </strong>I figured I should point out some things about Falcon&#39;s (great) wings.&nbsp; They are bulky and awkward sometimes, but great to play with.&nbsp; My favorite feature is how you can use them, especially one, as a shield the way he often does in the films when holding a gun.&nbsp; The stickers on the wings match his torso and work very well.&nbsp; Falcon himself is easily a favorite minifigure of mine.&nbsp; As I mentioned before, Redwing is a really nice hidden touch.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong> For a 375 piece Marvel, licensed set, a retail price of $29.99 is wonderful.&nbsp; I absolutely love seeing that.&nbsp; For&nbsp;four great minifigures, two amazing builds, and an above-and-beyond price-per-part ratio, $29.99 is a great price to pay for this set.</p>

<p><strong>Recap:&nbsp;</strong>For a Marvel collector, a Hulkbuster is a must-have, and this will very nicely fill that role.&nbsp; For simple play, the overall set&nbsp;works well too.&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s not much else to say about this... it&#39;s an amazing 5 out of 5 set that competes with and arguably tops its Hulkbuster and Marvel LEGO set counterparts.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-29T12:56:55.53Z","Collect the Stones, Phase 4","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #76104 The Hulkbuster Smash-Up:</b> Welcome to the next Infinity War set review. Which shares a name with a previous Avengers Age of Ultron set, kind of disappointing that LEGO didn&rsquo;t even try to pick a different name for the set. What&rsquo;s interesting is that this set doesn&rsquo;t actually feature Tony Stark, but let&rsquo;s discuss the set first.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This box shows off the set in all its glory. A set which features one giant buildable mech and one small insignificant enemy emplacement for the mech to pound on. It&rsquo;s also showing off the characters in the set as the story plays out on the front, while the back indicates the few play features which are included with this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Meanwhile, inside the manual, you&rsquo;ll find all of the steps necessary to construct the models included in this set. Using the numbered bag approach the set features build steps for all three sections of the build, which is fairly straightforward and relatively quick to follow along with. Stickers are used for most of the detailing in this set, so a sticker sheet is also included.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As this is another set with a Hulkbuster you&rsquo;ll find a lot of system parts and Constraction elements included in Iron Man red. I believe we also have a Mind Stone&hellip; Or whichever Infinity Stone the yellow one is. No printed elements in this set, everything is a sticker, there&rsquo;s a clear purple NEXO shield in the set too.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bruce Banner: Bruce has a plain black top with undershirt and a dual-sided facial print showing calm smile on one side and enraged glowing green eyes Hulk ready to come out and smash. No accessories, he gets to wear the suit this time.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Falcon: Wearing a new flight suit, Falcon has a much larger wing span this time around, his torso is covered in protective gear on the print, and his face has two familiar expressions. Once wearing flight goggles and with a serious scowl on his face the other grinning without the goggles on. Pretty decent figure.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Proxima Midnight: One of Thanos&rsquo; personal acolytes, Proxima Midnight features a single pearl gold arm while the rest of her torso features black and white. She has an interesting hair element with some horns integrated into it. These may or may not represent some kind of alien ears. Her weapon was massive in the movie, here it is represented by a graphite black lightsaber hilt and two black blades. She has two expressions, her regular smirking expression and one filled with rage.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Outrider: This figure is the same as the small Outrider Dropship set I&rsquo;ve already reviewed, so there isn&rsquo;t much to say here I didn&rsquo;t cover in that review.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Proxima Midnight builds a weapons emplacement that shoots LEGO marble-sized balls at the Avengers. This build is not in the movie, as far as I&rsquo;ve seen, I&rsquo;ll have to re-watch it soon to see if these are in there during the big battle. It&rsquo;s a decent enough build for the first bag, but can be irritating due to the Technic pins and axles needing to be aligned just right.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Bruce Banner appears to build the torso and cockpit section of the Hulkbuster. Compared to the original Hulkbuster model this build seems to share many design cues from that first model in the Age of Ultron sets. Some stickers are applied during this build, no tricky elements appeared while I was working on it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: The Outrider needs to run. It&rsquo;s leg building time. This is a repetitive section of the build as both of them are pretty much mirror images of themselves. So you&rsquo;ll probably get this section of the build finished relatively quickly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #4: Falcon joins us with the build for the arms. Again this is relatively quick, since both arms are basically the same build just the reverse or mirrored. There is a lot more sticker placement on this bag with Falcon&rsquo;s wings and all of the detailing on the arms. Again this model&rsquo;s build is rather similar to the Age of Ultron build from 2014 or 2015. It&rsquo;s got a play feature though, which I don&rsquo;t believe the original model had.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Hulkbuster in this set is fairly similar to the one we saw in the Age of Ultron sets. The build is slightly different, as this one incorporates a play gimmick, but the detailing is roughly the same. I think the cockpit section has been modified slightly to better accommodate Bruce, but while the torso is the same the legs are clearly much different. They&rsquo;ve enhanced and improved upon it, the added sticker detailing is pretty solid too. Twist the dial on his back and he will SMASH the enemy cannon.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Speaking of which this alternate model is something that is a bit better than what we saw in the Age of Ultron set, that had a &lsquo;cage&rsquo; to trap Hulk, this has a weapons emplacement. And honestly, it is something better for a play feature than that Super Jumper nonsense of 2015.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a solid offering from LEGO and I would recommend picking it up. If you want all of the Infinity Stones you&rsquo;ll need this set. The entire set is a huge improvement over the original Hulkbuster model, the feet are a better overall design and the arms are bulkier. The cockpit has been modified quite nicely as well. Highly Recommended.</p>
