<h2>&nbsp;</h2>

<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>Thanos: Ultimate Battle is the 2nd largest set in the first wave of Infinity War sets. It includes A Ravager&nbsp;M-ship, Thanos&nbsp;and the Infinity Gauntlet.This set is a combination of a sweet spaceship and some amazing Avenger minfigs and the one and only Mad Titan, Thanos. Plus it can combine with another set.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Building experience</h2>

<p>This was a medium sized set. It was a relatively easy build. There were roughly 210 steps to complete it. It was made of 8 bags separated&nbsp;into 6 sections. It took around a hour and half to build. It does include 13 stickers, but these can be left off, if you prefer. It was relatively traditional building with no surprises&nbsp;in design. However I did appreciate how its&#39; wings are held in place.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are 3 minifigures in this set. First is Ironman. He&nbsp;is sporting the Mrk 50 Bleeding-Edge suit, with extended boosters. I love the use of different red, gold, and silver details in his suit. I also like the brick-built boosters. He also comes with some laser blast accessories.</p>

<p>Next are Gamora and Star-Lord. Star-Lord is just a carry over from the GotG&nbsp;vol 2 sets. Gamora, however, is new. She includes a great amount of detail on the torso which caries over to the legs. Both come with there previous heads and traditional accessories.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final character is Thanos. He is new, but uses the same molding as the previous Thanos in set&nbsp;76049-1: Avenjet Space Mission. His new design is slightly underwhelming. Especially since it appears&nbsp;he will spend the majority of the movie without his armor on. Another problem is that his armor prevents much of the rotation you would normally find on a bigfig.&nbsp;Regardless he makes a nice addition to my collection.&nbsp;His accessories include a brick-built sword, and the Infinity Gauntlet. The gauntlet is comes with reality stone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Complete Set</h2>

<p>The complete model includes the M-ship, a small speeder, and a stand for the Gauntlet. The M-ship is the third Ravager style spaceship in the lego marvel superhereos&nbsp;line. It is slightly smaller to the original, and substantially larger than the second set. It has the best shaping and has room for more than 5 minifigures. the front cockpit folds open, and there is a rear hatch. Inside the mini speeder acts as the seats for the pilot and copilot. It also holds our heroes&#39; weapons. The back has a sliding ramp, and is capable of seating two more figures and the gauntlet stand. However the seats are hard to fit the minfigs in. Also the back does look rather blocky when closed. There are also adjustable fins on the wings and body of the ship, and stud-shooters&nbsp;on top.&nbsp;These add to the playability of the set, and do no hurt its overall appearance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Possibly the coolest feature is how it can combine with set #&nbsp;76102-1, Thor&#39;s Weapons quest. The smaller pod attaches to the back via some technic pins and hinged plates at the top. The two sets look even better as a combination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall I find this to be an excellent set. It includes very desirable minifigs;&nbsp;an amazing ship to play with;&nbsp;and the biggest, baddest villain in the entire MCU! The ship is offers a good selection of play features, and is still an excellent display piece. Also the price per piece is about 10.4 cents, which is fine for this intellectual property. I think this set would have been much better if it came with at least one more figure, and a movie accurate Thanos.&nbsp;I would also highly recommend purchasing set # 76102-1. Two ships in one is the icing on the cake; and buying both still cost less then $100 U.S. In conclusion this set is a fine example of a superheroes set with both great figures, and a surprising&nbsp;good main build. I would highly recommend it to any fans of Marvel Super Heroes, and Infinity War.</p>

<p>*FYI this is my first set review. I appreciate any constructive criticism and recommendations you have to offer. Also how can I add my photos for&nbsp;this review?</p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2018-04-03T02:40:24.307Z","Your Ultimate Doom has Come!! Are you Ready for it? God no! Well, here we go!!!","<p>Hello everybody. I am back to you with yet another review. This time, I&#39;ll be starting my Avengers: Infinity War Quest and I hope you&#39;ll be there to follow this amazing journey. To start us off, we have the Thanos Ultimate Battle Set</p>

<p><strong>Box and Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>The box is pretty long, but shows us some very amazing artwork. In my opinion, it really shows the set in a nice light. The instructions are pretty easy to follow, but in no way is this a short build.</p>

<p><b>Figures:</b></p>

<p>This is one of my favorite&nbsp;parts to review, to be honest. I&#39;ll start out with Star Lord. He is a nice figure, but is the exact same one from Ayesha&#39;s Revenge from last year. I don&#39;t mind though, as this is my first one of him. (Though I do realize he should have a different face for this movie). The best part of him to me is the guns, as they look really cool. Next is Gamora. This might be the best version of the character (excluding the one from the first wave). I like her jacket, as well as her face and hair. Her leg printing is nice as well. She is equipped with standard katanas, which are nice. Next is Iron Man. There has been so many versions of him, each improving on the last, but this might be the best one out there. He has superb printing on all sides, however, most amazing is his new face print featuring a hud. He is equipped with some nice laser pieces and a brick - built jetpack. Lastly, there is the Mad - Titan, himself. He is a very nice figure, but is not very accurate at all to the movie. However, I do like the giant sword and infinity gauntlet piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build takes longer due to the set&#39;s big size. However, I think most people should be able to handle the build, as it&#39;s not too hard. To me, the hardest parts were the stickers and building the wings (at least the first one)&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>Once you are finished with the model, it really looks amazing. The blend of the orange and gray works surprisingly well. The model is very sturdy and will not break (unless you drop it of course) The lack of play features is alright with me, as the model seems so amazing on it&#39;s own, and you can make some really great displays with it. However, what&#39;s even better is you can connect this set with the Thor&#39;s Weapon Quest set (sold separately), which makes the model so much better than it already does. Even the stickers add detail to it, which is probably the first time I said this. This set contains the Aether Infinity Stone.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>My Overall Thoughts:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is really great. For the most part, the figures are really nice. Not only that, but the model looks really fantastic. I like how this set is more of a display piece and how it can connect with another set. What I find fascinating about this whole wave is all the models seem really great (except that dippy Wakandan wall) and Lego has made a great decision by spreading the stones across the wave to make your own Gauntlet (Which I find really cool). I would definitely recommend this set as a gift or a set to buy if you like the Marvel Movies or just want a nice model. See you soon.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-29T12:59:28.277Z","Collect the Stones, Phase 5","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #76107 Thanos: Ultimate Battle:</b> Infinity War was a huge event and LEGO made a massive push with it back in 2018 showing off a whole wave of sets inspired by this movie phenomena. The sets were also all necessary to get the Infinity Stones, as the collect-them-all mentality was strong with LEGO Infinity War. This set features the most important item though, the Infinity Gauntlet itself, without it you won&rsquo;t have anywhere to put your stones. The set we are about to discuss is the second most expensive from Infinity War, and designed to combine with Thor&rsquo;s Weapon Quest.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The box is huge, perhaps a little too huge as there is some empty air inside despite this set featuring 6 numbered bags. The action shot on the front doesn&rsquo;t spoil anything from the movie, so don&rsquo;t worry about that. The back also shows a lot with the set such as the stud shooters and storage bay for the Gauntlet.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is huge and comes in a sealed plastic bag along with the sticker sheet. This prevents it from being damaged during storage. The card stock is fairly thick and the instructions are easy to follow along with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is an orange heavy set. The Guardian&rsquo;s ship features a lot of orange and silver/grey colours, it&rsquo;s a pretty solid parts pack for a set in this price range. The only printed element is the cockpit bubble, everything else needs stickers for the detailing. The energy elements, Infinity Gauntlet and Red Infinity Stone are included in this set as well, I believe the Red stone is the Power stone.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Gamora: We&rsquo;ve seen numerous iterations of Gamora since the first Guardians film sets were released. This version of the character is dressed in a brown duster over her black armored outfit, the torso is dual-sided and the legs feature some belt and coat flap printing. Her hair isn&rsquo;t new and she&rsquo;s wielding a katana, er, space katana. It&rsquo;s sciency and stuff. Her facial expressions include teeth gritting rage and smiling happy expression.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Iron Man: Tony really wants to destroy Thanos, this version of his armor includes four powerful thrusters attached to a back bracket and powered by the energy elements, four bursts of power are attached via hole studs. The rest of the energy elements are used to make powerful blasts or energy infused fists. As far as his print is concerned, the four energy thrusters have stickers on them, the rest of the torso is printed and looks fine. I believe this is his Mark 50 Suit. His head features a smiling expression on one side and a HUDs up display covered determined expression on the other.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Star-Lord: Star-Lord is really beginning to look more and more like Owen from Jurassic World. His hair piece is the same, the facial prints are closely identical, if not downright re-used between the pair of characters played by Chris Pratt and this version is wearing a loosely open outer red jacket with a grey shirt underneath that resembles the grey shirt worn by Owen in some of the 2019 Jurassic World sets. This set doesn&rsquo;t include his alternate facial mask, so going out into space without just seems silly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Thanos: This Big Fig is menacing, powerful, wields a giant sword and features a decent print. His hand can be replaced with the Infinity Gauntlet, being a Big Fig there isn&rsquo;t a whole lot to discuss, but his sculpt is fairly accurate&hellip; I can&rsquo;t be sure, as I missed out on his comic incarnation from earlier Avengers sets, but I think it&rsquo;s a re-release with new MCU styled printing for this version.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Star-Lord and Thanos duke it out for control of the Infinity Gauntlet, but first you need to build a small stand and hover vehicle, which is an extremely short and quick build. So quick in fact that there isn&rsquo;t much to discuss about it. Except for the fact that stickers are used here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Gamora gets involved to start building the central fuselage. This build is also quick, it may or may not be similar to the Milano from the Guardians Volume Two sets, I missed the chance to nab that set, and the older Milano does not use this build style, it&rsquo;s very fun building space ships. This model has a lot of orange in it though, so be careful to pay attention, because the more you build the harder it gets to recognize when a new piece needs to be attached.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: No Minifigures in this back, more of the central portion of the ship is built here, stickers are used now for detailing on the upper connectors which will be used with the small ship from Thor&rsquo;s Weapon Quest. This build is just adding to what was there before so you probably won&rsquo;t take too much time with it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #4: Now we finish the central section of the ship, adding the cockpit and the roof. The build is separate elements that attach to the central torso using studs and click joints. It&rsquo;s a pretty solid build, only a few stickers to use during this stage, the ship starts to show how awkward it is to hold as you build it here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #5: Two bags with the same number, both used to store parts for one wing. This entire build is just constructing a wing for the model, nothing too difficult about that. Or at least there shouldn&rsquo;t be, but there were some minor issues I came across while building this section. Mostly with a bar and clip bricks portion that is used as a connector for elements. Figuring out how to get the bricks down in the right spot to attach everything properly required a bit of trial and error. It could have been somewhat clearer.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #6: Iron-Man leaps to action and you build the other wing of the ship here, which is a mirror build from Bag 5. Or Bags 5, there are two number six bags too, because they separate the parts for the wing between two bags for some reason. It probably has to do with what elements are made and packaged and where. If you mastered the build from Bag 5 you&rsquo;ll be quick to finish this one off.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Guardian&rsquo;s Ship: This model is huge with sweeping wings, a rear cargo area for the Infinity Gauntlet on its stand and two seats to accommodate two Minfigures. The front control center has a removable speeder bike capable of seating two characters, Star-Lord and Gamora. It features clips for Star-Lord&rsquo;s pistols and Gamora&rsquo;s Space Katana. There are stud shooters on the front, a flip open front section and flip open cockpit. The wings are swept back for flight and do not move.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Overall this model is highly detailed, thanks to stickers and certain key use of parts and extremely enjoyable to play with. It can attach the small pod from Thor&rsquo;s Weapon Quest in the back, which is slightly confusing as to how it connects, but once you see how it&rsquo;s really quite seamless and easy to accomplish.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a huge improvement over the Milano. That initial model was large, capable of housing multiple Minifigures, indeed the entire Guardians team could fit inside that ship, minus the large brick-built Adult Groot. This ship is slightly smaller, has less character space and less characters to fit into said space. There&rsquo;s also far less interior designs, no tape player or anything like that. Still it&rsquo;s a solid set with a very nice model, it would have been better if they&rsquo;d included Mantis and Drax to help fight Thanos though, or perhaps Nebula and Mantis. Hard to say. Get it if you didn&rsquo;t already, but if you&rsquo;d prefer to have a large enough ship to fit all of the Guardians then stick with the original Milano set.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2018-05-24T18:05:38.053Z","""I hope they remember you Stark...""","<p>Thanos, the mad titan with the gauntlet. The driving force behind the entire&nbsp;<em>Infinity War&nbsp;</em>film. Well, this set was a must buy from launch and I am glad I found it at a discounted price ($56 USD). Its a beautiful build; not without its flaws of course, but ultimately the best Marvel related thing I have put up on a display shelf since 2012&#39;s Quinjet!<br />
<br />
Also, its been a while since the movie came out now so I will be discussing&nbsp;<em><strong>SPOILERS</strong></em>&nbsp;when I feel its appropriate to add context to the review.</p>

<p><strong>Figures</strong></p>

<p><em>Thanos</em>; this big fig is probably the driving reason most people are buying this set and I am overall pretty satisfied with him. He does have armor on, which is inaccurate to the majority of the film were he takes off his armor in the first scene after getting the Space Stone from Loki. The Lego figure comes with a big sword that looks like a butter knife... can&#39;t get the image of Thanos spreading some butter over a giant piece of toast out of my head when he holds his sword. But lets be honest, I dropped the sword like a hot potato as soon as I had the Infinity Gauntlet on the figure. The set comes with the Reality Gem and the instructions show the film accurate placement of the six gems from the other sets into the Gauntlet. The gauntlet looks great, and the push to &quot;collect them all&quot; to get all six infinity stones is a great marketing ploy by Lego. The more stones in the gauntlet the better it looks!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<em>Gamora;&nbsp;</em>This is the third iteration of Thanos&#39;s adopted assassin daughter&nbsp;and matches her appearance in the film. The head and hair are identical to her appearances in the Guardian&#39;s of the Galaxy sets from last year, but the torso is finally a new design. I don&#39;t like how big the swords she carries look, but I can&#39;t think of a better piece to represent them currently in the Lego parts catalog.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<i>Starlord;&nbsp;</i>Peter Quill is a reprint of the same figure used in last year&#39;s Guardian&#39;s of the Galaxy sets, with the notable omission of his helmet. I have seen a lot of AFOL&#39;s comment that they wish Peter used the same face as Owen from the upcoming Jurassic World sets to give the figure a more prominent Chris Pratt look with the mustache. But, other than that I can&#39;t really say its a bad figure. Just a bit disappointing that no changes have been made to it since last year.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<em>Iron Man;&nbsp;</em>Tony Stark&#39;s increasingly complex suits are a highlight of every Marvel movie wave, and this is the first new Iron Man suit we have gotten since the Spiderman Homecoming variant last year. I love it. The big back pack flight arms stuff is bulky, but gives sufficient support to stand the figure up despite the extra weight. The new &#39;power blast&#39; stuff looks great on Iron Man with the impression that he is shooting off energy from his hand mounted repulsors. The new face print for Tony with the holographic display printed on the head is awesome and recreates the iconic &quot;in helmet&quot; shots we have seen on Tony since the original Iron Man film in 2008. I love this figure, and its a highlight of the set for me.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>I did get the 2017&nbsp;<em>Milano </em>and the smaller Raveger M-Ship&nbsp;Taserface&nbsp;came with in last year&#39;s Guardians of the Galaxy sets... but neither really captured the look of the M-Ship class as we have seen in the films for me. But now, with the orange clad <em>Benatar</em> in Lego, I feel Lego has made the best looking M-Ship since the 2014 Milano. The build is great, lots of cool SNOT and hinges to slope the wings and get little greebling on the side. The model looks good from all angles, even from below with the detailed vertical lift thrusters represented with some simple dish pieces on the bottom of the wings.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This model is also blessed with plenty of internal space! Two seats in the cockpit, two in the hold and a single stud to either hold the Infinity Gauntlet stand or have a single standing figure opens up a lot of room to place figures in this set. Adding the pod from the Thor&#39;s Weapon Quest extends the Benatar&#39;s&nbsp;capacity with room for three more additional figures. I have said before that I love sets with seating room, and this set definitely scratches that itch.<br />
<br />
<strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>The finished model as I previously mentioned is great, and I love the included figures! This is a great all around set. However, by itself the flat back of the <em>Benatar</em> reveals the set is missing something. I feel like this set doesn&#39;t feel 100% complete unless it is connected to the Thor&#39;s Weapon Quest which includes a detachable pod craft which hooks up to the end of this model. The two sets combined look even better than either does individually. Now if a second purchase is seen as a pro or con depends on the buyer; but personally I enjoyed that the two sets are indeed separate allowing for staggered purchasing, and that both include figures which complement each other (Starlord, Gamora, Thanos&nbsp;&amp; Iron Man in this set; Rocket, Groot &amp; Thor in the other). I do think this set could have been improved by including one more figure such as Drax or Mantis to further round out the Guardian&#39;s available in this wave; a variant of The Collector&nbsp;(who has only been previously seen as an SDCC exclusive),&nbsp;or the inclusion of Red Skull whose interaction with Thanos and Gamora&nbsp;at the site of the Soul Stone was an emotional scene in the film (although his inclusion in a Lego set would have spoiled the surprise of seeing that character in the film).</p>

<p>Despite those nitpicks, I think this is an excellent model on display with some great play opportunities. I highly recommend this set to any Marvel fan looking for Thanos and his Gauntlet with a great Lego built spaceship&nbsp;too! If you can find it at discount like I did, it is definitely worth it.</p>

"ninjago85","2019-10-17T03:46:03.46Z","The fight for the reality stone","<p>When re-creating Avengers: Infinity War, this set definitely is vital if a person is determined to have all the beats for Infinity War. The Benatar is a great build, and it&#39;s minifigures drive it home. I think including Thanos was a smart choice for this set, since most other minifigures are not as sought after. I do think that adding either Drax or Nebula could help add more space to the battle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The flaw with this set is that the ultimate battle can only be acted out with the minifigures since the Benatar has no weapons other that some stud shooters. I do think adding some more projectile weapons could contribute to playability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this set would make for a great addition to any collector&#39;s supplies, due to the great design of the Benatar and the inclusion of Thanos and the Infinity Gauntlet, which are exclusive to this set.</p>

In a $70 dollar set I would expect the minifigs to have more details than their counterparts in far cheaper sets. </span></span></span></span></p>

Buying this set gives you Thanos and the infinity gauntlet, which makes collecting the rest of the Infinity War series an awesome experience. With each set build you get to add a stone to the gauntlet and it is a really cool experience to be a fan of the films and see your Thanos figure getting closer and closer to completing his gauntlet. Though I will warn you, Thanos feels incomplete without all the stones, if you have no desire to complete the series you may want to avoid the temptations this set presents. The Benatar ship is great for display, but I think lacked some components of playability for children. I think the minifig selection and detail could have been better, but as part of the infinity war series I think they make good additions to the cast. For $70 dollars there are certainly better value sets in the LEGO line, but if you can pick this up on discount it becomes more worth it. I would recommend this set to collectors of the Marvel LEGO series, especially those looking to complete the Infinity War series, but if you are a parent or collector not interested in that series there are better value options available. </span></span></span></span></p>
