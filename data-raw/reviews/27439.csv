The Minifigures are nicely detailed, exclusive, and not to mention, perfect ( except for the spider-man, But I&#39;ll get to that shortly.) But the buildings are the absolute best part of the set. the sanctum sanctorum and the pizza parlour are nearly perfect. each building is 3 stories high, with different rooms, especially Peter Parker&#39;s bedroom and computer room. there are also many features inside the the buildings, too. like exploding walls and windows, and even a trap door. my favorite feature is on the water tower with a string to deploy spier man from the top of the building and straight to the bottom. overall, this set is for marvel fans(this set is the only with the green Infinity Stone), city builders, and brickfilms.</p>

<p>Pros: all 4 minifigures, the big figure, the BEAUTIFUL buildings, the printed window dish on the top of the sanctorum, the green infinity stones, the wepons.</p>

<p>Cons: spider-man&#39;s legs are not dual molded, technic holes an studs are exposed on the pizza parlour.</p>

"tomalphin","2018-05-18T17:19:55.08Z","A great bridge between smaller ""Creator"" building sets, and the ""Creator Expert"" Modular Building series.","<p>I had the opportunity to review this set for Brick Architect website.&nbsp; I also like to share my reviews at Brickset.&nbsp; This is an excerpt of the <a href=""http://brickarchitect.com/2018/review-76108-sanctum-sanctorum-showdown/"">longer review</a>.</p>

<p><strong><a href=""http://brickarchitect.com/2018/review-76108-sanctum-sanctorum-showdown/""><img alt="""" src=""http://brickarchitect.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/opengraph-76108_Sanctum.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 315px;"" /></a></strong></p>

<p><strong>Initial Impressions</strong></p>

<p>At first glance, this set&rsquo;s high level of architectural detailing looks like it belongs in the Modular Buildings series. At 99.99$ for 1004 pieces, it is a good deal smaller and less expensive than the modular buildings.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building the model</strong></p>

<p>The construction process uses 8 numbered bags, so you will only have a few parts on the table at any given time. This felt like too many bags given the modest size of the model, but I suspect this was intentional to keep each bag to around 20 minutes of construction time, and to reduce frustration searching for the part you need. For younger builders, it might make sense to only assemble one bag each day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Architectural Detailing</strong></p>

<p>Of the two buildings, the Sanctum side of the model is the strongest by far. The three stories reflect three different styles of architectural detailing. The bottom floor has a rusticated stone fa&ccedil;ade and sloping concrete base suggesting a strong foundation. The second story has a nice contrast between the stone columns and orange stucco. the top floor has a Second Empire style roof, with rectangular windows on either side of an oversized oculus-style window.</p>

<p>While the large round window is creative license on behalf of Marvel, the use of three distinct styles representing the bottom floor, middle floors, and very top floor is quite common in urban residential architecture in Europe and North America. Highly decorated urban residences drew inspiration from rural palaces, at the same period in history when affluent people chose to move to the cities.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions:</strong></p>

<p>While it doesn&rsquo;t quite meet the level of architectural detailing found in the Creator Expert modular building series,&nbsp;#76108 Sanctum Sanctorum Showdown&nbsp;is a fantastic introduction to the style. It comes&nbsp;<strong>Highly Recommended</strong>&nbsp;due to thoughtful architectural detailing, great minifigs, and a fair price.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-29T13:01:14.46Z","Collect the Stones, Phase 6","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #76108 Sanctum Sanctorum Showdown:</b> Welcome to the next large structure from LEGO Marvel Super Heroes, or at least the second building for the Avengers of the MCU as we have seen a large section of bridge in 2015 or so for a Spider-Man set that wasn&rsquo;t part of the MCU. This is a fully enclosed building similar to Avengers Tower, though obviously slightly larger. It&rsquo;s also the most expensive Infinity War set, let&rsquo;s discuss everything before coming to any sort of conclusion, shall we?</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a huge box, showing off the set in all its brilliant glory. Love the size gives a real heft to the contents despite how few bags are actually inside. The action scene in the front is very impressive while the back shows off the impressive amount of details found inside this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is a very thick booklet sealed in a wrapped bag alongside the two sticker sheets that are included with this set for the detailing. It&rsquo;s a rare sight indeed, I can count on my hands how many sets I own with this thickness of manual. More often than not they make them smaller and more compact. Either way, let&rsquo;s move on to discuss the parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is loaded with masonry bricks in tan, silver bars, a red and blue package of the energy elements introduced with LEGO Marvel, it&rsquo;s also got the Time Stone, a very nice selection of building elements (windows, doorframes etc.) and some decent large plates. Definitely a very useful selection of parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Cull Obsidian: Represented by a Big Fig, this member of Thanos&rsquo; elite has the standard Big Fig torso design, but features a uniquely sculpted head replacing the head on Gladiator Hulk&rsquo;s torso, his shoulder armor is slightly different too, and yet still hinders arm movement. It can only rotate so far before it hits the pauldron on the one side. Overall, not a bad Big Fig, the details are nice, but he&rsquo;s not as functional with one of his arms due to the shoulder armour.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Doctor Strange: This Minifigure is 95% the same as the version made in 2016&rsquo;s Doctor Strange Sanctum Sanctorum set, the only changes made were the use of a two piece cape for his Cloak of Levitation instead of the single piece LEGO originally made and his hair piece has been better sculpted to fit the character better than widow&rsquo;s peak Joker hair. This version also includes a plethora of accessories. The Energy Element pieces in orange are used to represent mystic blasts, these can be held by attaching them to the stud with bar element most Super Hero Minifigures use these days.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ebony Maw: Thanos&rsquo; acolyte is quite impressive as a Minifigure. Highly dangerous, this sinister preacher of all things Thanos works to steal the Time Stone from Doctor Strange. He includes very impressive detailing on his torso and leg print. His head is a unique new colour for a Minifigure head. It&rsquo;s a sort of really light teal or very pale green which is interesting I suppose, sadly it isn&rsquo;t much for re-use unless you want to wipe the Ebony Maw face printing clean to make your own character. Honestly though this is a solid looking character, the back of his head even features scraggly hair print and his accessories are the clip on flick-fire or press-fire energy blasts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Iron Man: The Mark 50 Armour here isn&rsquo;t changed from his other suits, I mean the details of the print are different from other armours, but the basic parts use is all the same. Torso, legs, helmet pieces and even the Tony head underneath has been seen in other sets. He uses the new energy elements in traditional blue to simulate energy blasts, flight and many other repulsor effects. A pretty solid Iron Man.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Iron Spider-Man: This Minifigure is terrible. Ok, that&rsquo;s being a bit harsh, but honestly LEGO should have made this a dual-molded leg figure. The all red legs with blue printing on the upper legs for detailing to match the suit is just terrible. I&rsquo;m fairly certain dual-molding was introduced by now, there is no excuse for wasting a dual-mold here, especially for a set of this price range.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, two thirds of this Minifigure are great. The torso has some great detail work, even his blue arms have side-printing. The masked head is pretty much what we&rsquo;ve seen before in many figures, I&rsquo;m not sure if it is any different, but it&rsquo;s still a solid Spidey look. The back-mounted arms or Walldos or whatever Marvel officially calls them fit on the back-bracket element used by most Outriders quite effectively. He has two solid white clip launchers for his hands to represent web shots.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The complete lack of proper parts use for his legs though seriously hinder the look of this character. I am greatly disappointed LEGO.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Doctor Strange helps to build the front entrance and a side-section of the building. This is where the fun begins, the build is extremely short, most of the walls and other structure are not yet built, the door has a sticker placed on it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: The walls and second story floor are put in during this build, it&rsquo;s a pretty solid build, but slightly repetitive for the wall sections. Expect more sticker placement, nothing really troubling during this phase of the construction project.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: Cull Obsidian is read to help build the second floor of Doctor Strange&rsquo;s home before he smashes it, the walls are again built up with repetitive steps. That being said you will have more stickers to place and more fun adding interior details such as a mystical treasure chest and bookcase. (There aren&rsquo;t any books, but the Time Stone and a Magical artifact is placed here.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #4: Ebony Maw comes forth to aid in capturing the Time Stone, but first he will help build the ground floor pizzeria. This is an equally fun build, but here is where there are issues. The only connection is the hinge brick at the bottom of the wall structure, which means as you push down bricks, plates and other elements you run the risk of having the two halves of the building separating. Unless you build this on a table or hard surface you may find yourself with a host of grumblings and frustrations as you constantly need to restore the stability of the structure.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #5: The second story is completed with this build as you make Peter&rsquo;s apartment, Peter Parker lives next door to Doctor Strange? Well, according to this set he does, inside you&rsquo;ll build his desk with computer and what may be a storage room for a box labeled Peter&rsquo;s Stuff. (A sticker, not a printed tile.) Many of the steps will be repetitive, but that&rsquo;s because of all the windows, walls and structural elements that share steps between them. The same problem with the previous build is here, do not build this anywhere but on a table or hard surface otherwise the set will move around too much and separate from the connection point on the lower floor.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #6: Iron Spider leaps into action to help everyone finish building the apartment complex, now is his bedroom and a room which may or may not be a living room. The apartment is built very quickly and efficiently. CAUTION: I was missing one 4521439 element, specifically a 1x2 window frame in black, it was replaced by an extra hinge brick, which probably should not have been there. Unfortunate, but it is what it is, other than the missing piece the build was perfectly fine and we&rsquo;re coming close to the end of the first sticker sheet. The second smaller sticker sheet will be finished after this build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #7: Another quick and easy build here for the other side of the building, the top level of Doctor Strange&rsquo;s home. This build uses up the last of the sticker sheet, which leaves nothing left to apply, whatever is left will have to be printed. This section is only partially completed, once we move on to the final build we will finish it off along with the roof. As for what is built here, it&rsquo;s nice to see the book builds return, and more mystical trinkets will sit on the bookcases on this level once you&rsquo;ve completed this section of the build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #8: And at last we construct the final part of the building, complete with Iron Man helping to finish it off, it&rsquo;s a pretty quick build, you make the water tower on Spider-Man&rsquo;s apartment complex, the final aspects of the roof for Doctor Strange&rsquo;s Sanctum and then make the fire escape, which is somewhat repetitive. This final build completes the entire model, which it is now time to discuss.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Now then let us discuss this model, this model&hellip; IS AWESOME! I do not know if it would fit in very well with your Modulars. I guess I&rsquo;ll find out once I build the Parisian Restaurant I picked up to see if they actually compare, size wise I doubt it, but again I have no experience as of yet. What I can compare this to is Avengers Tower, this model is slightly wider than the Avengers Tower model. It features the same functionality as the Tower though. You can play with it open or closed using the hinged bricks which allow access to the highly detailed interior.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">In order to justify the inclusion of certain characters Doctor Strange&rsquo;s Sanctum is one half of the building, while the other half is Peter Parker&rsquo;s apartment complete with ground floor pizzeria.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The ground floor has a small pizzeria on one side, inside you&rsquo;ll find a pizza baking oven, a cash register and counter, a fire extinguisher an access door for Minifigures to enter and exit and a push device to blow out the window. Opposite this is the first floor of the Sanctum complete with mystical axe and sword clipped to the wall, a lamp with a short chain attached to it for some odd reason and a green chair. No play features on this level of the Sanctum.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Moving to the interior of the second floor we have a chest with more mystical weapons, a spear and stave attached to the wall lots of books and a trophy of some sort on a bookcase and the Time Stone hidden behind the statue. For some odd reason the book case has a Technic axle joint attached to it, but there is no play feature associated with this so I&rsquo;m not entirely certain why that is. It might have something to do with the trap door on the third floor of Spidey&rsquo;s apartment, but that really doesn&rsquo;t do anything except gives the trap door a stopping point so it can&rsquo;t hit the window.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Speaking of the second floor opposite, Peter has a desk and computer here to work on making new Spidey costumes, there&rsquo;s even a stickered tile showing a drawing of his first Spidey costume. There&rsquo;s also some chemistry stuff where he can mix web fluid. The doorframe leads to a little storage area where some bricks are placed to show some packed stuff. Guess Peter just moved in and hasn&rsquo;t unpacked still.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The third floor features two more bookcases with books on top and mystical artifacts on the bottom, for some reason Strange keeps a skull and crystal goblet on this floor along with his desk. Everything is very condensed, but you can fit Minifigures here if you must. Opposite the Sanctum floor is Peter&rsquo;s bed and an empty area. On the exterior is a large web attached to some Technic elements, rotate this down and you can blow out Peter&rsquo;s bedroom window which leads to the fire escape out back. The bare area with nothing in it but the suspicious looking red 1x2 element traditionally used for side panels and things on small car models is where a trap door is located. You pull the technic pin forward on the outside and the trapdoor will fall open.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The interior is loaded with details, but the exterior has a lot of details too. The windows are highly impressive, on both sides, the more traditional LEGO window elements are on the apartment side of the building, while opposite is a lot more art deco inspired windows with clips as buttresses everywhere and the large circular window on the top floor which is a printed element. The fourth floor of the model is the roof and up here is a small water two build which can rotate and some chimneys on the Sanctum side of the roof. The reason why the water tower rotates is so you can simulate web swinging action, on the apartment side of the roof is a spot where Spidey can stand, attach the web line to him and you can have him leap from the roof. Then you can pose him any length so he can swing around the upper part of the building, the middle part or the ground floor.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The apartment side also has a very nice looking fire escape, which is extremely well done. I love the touch of using the bars and droid arms to make a proper looking fire escape.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Stickers are found everywhere, webbing is all over the place as are signs, graffiti and hidden portals which Strange is using during the battle. Overall this model is extremely loaded with details and I feel is actually a bit of an improvement to the Avengers Tower build from Age of Ultron. As far as a display item and toy are concerned.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Very impressive model and loaded with a good selection of characters. Not a great selection. It might have been nice to see a Stan Lee Minifigure to represent Random Citizen in danger during the battle for the Time Stone, I mean this is a 130$ set at MSRP with only four Minifigures and a single Big Fig. I suppose the entire point of this set is to get the Time Stone, but we still haven&rsquo;t gotten a Stan Lee Minifigure in any MCU sets and I&rsquo;m pretty sure we&rsquo;d like to see one officially without it being a stupid SDCC exclusive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;d definitely recommend this set, in fact this and the Tower makes a nice little MCU NYC display, which is great if you stick a Statue of Liberty build in the background or something to really sell the NYC angle. I hope we see more buildings in the future, it might be nice for a 15 years of the MCU to get more buildings, like the Sharma place or Spider-Man&rsquo;s school. Great set, great details, almost great Minifigures, Highly Recommended.</p>

"Faefrost","2019-01-23T02:10:18.333Z","Fantastic Set that almost rises to all time best, but doesn't quite get there. ","<p>One of the best Marvel sets. That only suffers slightly from trying to serve 2 masters. This is without question the best Marvel Location set Lego has produced. Dr. Stranges Sanctum Sanctorum&nbsp;alongside Spider-Man&#39;s New York Apartment above a Pizza Shop. It really is a remarkable offering, as it almost perfectly works alongside the Creator Expert Modular Buildings. Which is it&#39;s greatest strength and appeal, but also a slight weakness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions- It&#39;s Big, showing the street level fight in front on the building. In the picture the building is in the corner configuration. The instructions are a thick bound book. Also included are 2 sticker sheets. One opague&nbsp;paper type for most of the signage and decorations, and one smaller sheet of clear stickers for the various window decorations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts - Quite impressive in a number of ways. The printed Seal Window of the Sanctum is gorgeous and something Moc&#39;cers have long wanted. A good assortment of Dark Tan and Medium Dark Flesh parts. Plus two full bags of minifig&nbsp;effects parts. One set in Blue one in Orange. Plus some trans yellow spell bursts for Ebon Maw.</p>

<p>Minifigs&nbsp;- You get 4 A list minifigs&nbsp;plus a story critical Big Fig. There are no clunkers in this one. Each figure is magnificent. You get almost the entire NYC Battle cast from Infinity War. The only ones missing are Wong (sadly) and Bruce Banner. I believe each figure is unique to this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Strange - The Master of the Mystic Arts is well represented here. with a paint detailed hair piece, dual sided head, 2 part cloak of levitation and printed front and back torso. There is also the above mentioned Orange effects parts to represent his spells, which really helps kick him up a notch.</p>

<p>Iron Man Mk 50 - Tony Stark in his new Nano Tech suit. Considering the contortions of the on screen suit, the basic minifig&nbsp;is a little plain. It&#39;s the standard older style IM helmet with removable face plate. Which nicely lets you see his face. Tony&#39;s double sided head includes a blue colored holographic HUD face which looks really cool. He has front and back torso and leg printing. Like Dr. Strange what really elevates him is the bag of blue effects parts which let you simulate his boot rockets, various repulsors&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spider-Man Iron Spider suit - Spider Man in his black red and gold &quot;Iron Spider&quot; armor suit, complete with gold backpack spider legs. It&#39;s a great minifig. A must have for the Spider collectors. Spider-Man also has a pair of white &quot;web&quot; flinger pieces for his hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ebon Maw - Thano&#39;s wonderfully creepy sorcerous leader of the Black Order. He is nicely rendered with very pale blue (aqua?) skin. His head is printed on both sides (only 1 face) Torso has detailed front and back printing and nicely printed legs. He has a pair of trans yellow energy blast flinger pieces for his hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cull Obsidian - our Big Fig is probably the least impressive of the line up. But he is still really nice. He has a nice head sculpt and shoulder armor piece. he feels a little small for the character. he is about the same size as Hulk Big Figs, but substantially smaller than the Hulkbuster&nbsp;armor in the other set. He is molded in Dark Tan and Dark Bluish Grey. He has a nice torso print. No printing on back legs or arms. His weapon also is a bit underwelming. Being just a pair of brick built hammers attached by a chain. seeing as none of the toymakers got his weapon correct I&#39;m assuming that was a late finalized design in the movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build/Model - The building(s) is really the only build in the set. Unless you count Cull Obsidian&#39;s Hammers and Spider-Mans backpack. But boy what a built it is. It is rather cleverly a double sided Dollhouse style building. So the front half and the rear half represent two different buildings. Dr. Stranges&nbsp;Greenwich Village Townhouse/Sanctum Sanctorum and Spider-Man&#39;s Queens apartment above a Pizza Parlor. When closed the building is just about the same size as one of the 16 stud wide Modular buildings. So Pretty close to the two Pet Shop buildings. If you put some sidewalk in front of it it perfectly blends in a Modular City. The genius of it is it has three modes of display. Closed it is a fully solid 4 walled building. Open at 90 degrees and it is a nice corner scene and there is a small corner detail piece with newspaper machine and garbage can to sell. it. Or you can open it 180 degrees and it is two side by side buildings on a city street with open backs. Like most City and SuperHero&nbsp;buildings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The interiors of each building are fairly shallow being about 8 studs from front outer wall to the rear edge of each. Each has three floors each depicting a small scene. And each building has a few destructive action features. The first floor of Dr. Stranges&nbsp;has his sitting room, Second floor is his bedroom and third floor holds his artifacts. On the other side the first floor is a Pizza shop. The second is Peters room and the third is the attic where Peters boxes and costume are hidden. (from the various boxes you get the feeling the Parkers are either moving in or moving out).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The action features are one of the areas where the set gets fouled up serving 2 masters. You have big obvious red pieces designating action levers on the front facings of otherwise gorgeous buildings. Not so hidden gimmicks such as the web line that unreels from the water tower. The Spider-Man building further suffers a bit from having exposed technic beams running across the front facing. If you plan on adding this to your Modular City you will want to do a small amount of Moc/Mod&#39;ing to cover up those beams and add a touch more texture in their place. The set as designed features a lot of exposed studs on various facings for heroes to attach to. Visually they don&#39;t look great. But can easily be fixed with some window boxes&nbsp;with plants, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is one other minor negative if you want this set for your Modular City. You really really are going to want 2. So you can display it as both a full 16 wide Sanctum Sanctorum and a Full 16 wide Pizza Place. You can either simply put two sets side by side, just spun 180 degrees so each gets a street facing. Or you can mod each during the building such that&nbsp;the two Dr Strange halves are together and the two apartment halves are hinged together. Either way the results are impressive. They aren&#39;t as detailed as the Modulars, especially inside. But they are close enough to work and add some new styles to your city. Of course this leaves you with a full extra set of minifigs and you&#39;ve now paid the &quot;BigFig&nbsp;Tax&quot; twice :/</p>

<p>Overall - This is by far the best of teh Infinity War sets. It has all the needed characters. Is a fully self contained dense play environment. And is detailed enough to satisfy AFOL&#39;s. Get it while you can. Better yet get two.&nbsp;</p>

There is so much detail in this set and some of the build aspects are very unique and cool. The pop-out wall hiding the infinity stone and the Sanctum window were two particularly enjoyable build aspects.

It has amazing detail and structure in this tiny space. The oven, dough machine, register, and stickers&hellip;whoever designed this room nailed the vibe of everyone&rsquo;s local pizza joint. A++ to whoever was involved in that particular room design. </span></span></span></span></p>

The Dr. Strange minifig is the same one from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76060-1/Doctor-Strange-s-Sanctum-Sanctorum"">76060</a>, but this one comes with a different hair piece and the Iron-man minifig&nbsp;can also be found in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76107-1/Thanos-Ultimate-Battle"">76107</a>, but this version does not come with the neck bracket.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></p>

The Cull Obsidian fig is great, but they gave him a different weapon. The Ebony Maw minifig has great print, but the color tone is off making him difficult to distinguish as the MCU character. I feel like the villains in the overall series could have been done a bit better. </span></span></span></span></p>

If you don&rsquo;t get it centered the first time you cannot peel them back off without leaving residue where it was first placed making the whole thing look terrible. So if you are getting this as a parent it may be beneficial to help your kids with those stickers if they aren&rsquo;t experienced with them. </span></span></span></span></p>

You can collect all the minfigs and structures from another series, but this one has a sort of defining feature of completeness. If you are a fan of the MCU and LEGO this series is a must buy.

"Vikn","2021-02-04T08:34:05.97Z","Great set, even for very casual Marvel fans","<p>I recently started using brickset during my 2nd adult age lego phase but had a number of sets from when I last got into them which was most of 2019. I am not planning on retroactively reviewing every set I got back then but this is one of the few I feel compelled to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I feel like that because I am a very casual marvel/superhero fan. I am basically like everyone who watched&nbsp;most of the Marvel films once and enjoyed several but I&#39;m not into the IP enough to take time away from the various other nerd things I love. This set is a special case because, despite not being anything more than a fair weather fan, I still really love and recommend this set to any lego fan, even if Marvel isn&#39;t you&#39;re thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&#39;re curious and want to try a marvel set but not interested enough to buy several sets, this Sanctum is tied for 1st as far as what I&#39;d suggest. The other set that I&#39;d equally recommend is kind of cheating because it&#39;s technically two sets that combine, being the Thanos Ultimate Battle AND Thor&#39;s weapon quest. I only count it because the latter is so small and really completes the former.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you have no interest in getting those two together, this is the easy choice. There are a couple&nbsp;things I hate in a lego set. Otherwise I am pretty optimistic, but I can&#39;t stand sets that either</p>

<p>1: Shoehorn in a vehicle just so Lego can increase the price, ESPECIALLY if it is a heavily scaled down version...really hate that lol</p>

<p>2. Moderate pc count buildings that still end up as facades....I hate this less than the former and would qualify more as an annoyance or just personal preferences. Because of this I almost never buy sets below 2k pcs, Especially if it&#39;s a building.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Somehow, Lego has made a surprisingly solid building with only 1k pcs. I have seen flimsy facades in sets with pcs closer to 2k that pale in comparison to this. It&#39;s far from a creator expert modular, but I was very pleasantly surprised at the respectable detail and interesting build.</p>

<p>I have no interest in play features, being an adult fan, and 95% would rather a set not have them in exchange for detail or scale. The Sanctum actually has some interesting features that qualify as both play features for kids AND cool secrets or mechanisms that may be interesting for an adult. The figures are respectable for the moderate size which is often&nbsp;a major factor for some fans.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even looking at the 2019 helicarrier (and certainly the absurd, baby focused 2021 iteration) it still seems that this set is the superior offering despite being far smaller. Of course, thats just preference, but I am writing this review for a casual marvel fan who is considering a single set to try from the&nbsp;Marvel themes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is extremely simple for a structure when compared to the amazing offerings Lego gives us in Creator expert, ideas and even the large Ninjago sets, but it simply felt worthwhile. There is enough going on within the Sanctum itself that it never felt that Lego subjected us to a soulsucking, barren building interior.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The value for marvel sets is often lacking in my opinion, which may be why this great addition stands out so much. It seems absurd that this set was in stores at 100$ during the same period that the Compound Battle was selling for the same price...there is no reason to ever have considered the Compound in my opinion.</p>

<p>While pcs ct is certainly not the primary metric in determining value, it seems equally foolish to totally ignore the pcs ct, which seems to be the pseudo-discerning critic reaction to &quot;casual&quot; fans that live and die by the price per piece. I bring that up because (prior to the recent grevious shop) the contrast between the two sets seemed almost comical and having the options of either&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1) for 100$ , 700ish pc, flimsy facade, decent minifigures but not worth the money and TWO scaled down, useless vehicles only for children with no sense of scale or film accuracy...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>OR</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2) for 100$, a little over 1k pcs, solid if relatively simple building with surprisingly detailed interior for such a set, numerous interesting features that don&#39;t quite qualify as &quot;play features&quot; and therefore may appeal to adults, NO garbage vehicles to justify a ripoff price, still quite good minifigs with an interesting iron spider (I think its called that?), Iron man, a cool Dr Strange with display worthy magic hand accessories to look like wizard energy, I guess? But the two villains really stood out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It came with that old looking, most powerful of Thanos&#39;s kids...something Maw I think? Hadn&#39;t seen him too often...and it also came with the bigfig of that massive Thanos-spawn that I hadnt seen in another set....plus he has a fascinating chain/hammer weapon that&#39;s just aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So yea if youre a super casual Marvel fan but want to try a set, this is one of the two options that sit miles ahead of the rest. If you NEED Thanos, the Thanos Battle set with the Milano is miles better than the compound and the very cheap Thors Weapon Quest set augments it wonderfully where Id suggest always getting them together...but if you don&#39;t need Thanos, the sanctum is the best choice by a wide margin (barring the thanos milano).</p>

<p>To me at least, it seems far better than even Marvel&#39;s &quot;flagship&quot; build; Helicarrier (the nanoscale...the other one is horrendous based on what I look for, sure great for kids)&nbsp;</p>

<p>So yea, this is the easiest single set for me to say comfortably sits as the best in its theme. The theme may be inconsistent, but while it&#39;s flawed, it is far from &quot;bad&quot;. Definitely pick this up if you can.</p>
