"I_am_Groot","2018-05-21T04:22:57.393Z","Run! RUUUUUN!","<p>The star of this set is a brand new Pteranodon with an olive green and dark red color scheme. Having never owned one before, I will have to say it is much larger than I thought it be.&nbsp;I think that the dark bluish gray/dark red&nbsp;one is&nbsp;my favorite&nbsp;but it looks very good overall and I am happy to add it to my dinosaur collection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>Two Minifigures are included in this set. Owen Grady is a fantastically detailed figure which uses a brand new double sided face. The detail on the torso is phenomenal! This figure is definitely not exclusive as he also comes in 3 other sets. An unnamed&nbsp;female &quot;Guard&quot; is also included which uses the same torso and leg prints as all the other ones in this wave. She uses Mantis&#39;s head from GOTG2. Also included are a&nbsp;Tranquilizer gun, black wrench, and&nbsp;an egg.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>The build for this set is some type of oversized&nbsp;jeep. My least favorite part of the whole set is that the&nbsp;vehicle sits&nbsp;way too high off the ground. Despite being 6x11 studs, it can only seat one person. There is a container on the back you can store the egg in as well as a clip on either side for holding onto the gun and wrench. The vehicle is equipped with a yellow 2018 net shooter. It functions okay, but unfortunately, the net itself is way to small to trap the Pteranodon included. Despite&nbsp;consisting of&nbsp;only about&nbsp;124 parts,&nbsp;the building experience was very fun and interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Verdict:</p>

<p>Overall, I find this to be a very good set. Having a price per part ratio at 15.9 cent a piece, this set is definitely not for everyone, but I definitely think this set has some great value with Owen and the exclusive Pteranodon being included. The building experience was very fun for this set&#39;s size. While this set&nbsp;may not be very memorable or unique,&nbsp;I would recommend it, unless you are on a budget. In that case I would recommend saving your money for a larger set.</p>

Fallen Kingdom has hit with mixed results for many, and LEGO includes a brand new batch of sets based around the premise of this new film, this fanciful set represents a scene that was never depicted in the actual film, but it fits in quite nicely with the overall theme of Jurassic World and includes another nice looking vehicle.</span></span></span></span></p>

His torso is also sporting a darker shirt which is more unkempt looking and open around the collar, but the vest jacket he&rsquo;s wearing is the same brown colour with completely different pocket detailing.</span></span></span></span></p>

His expressions are different though, one side is a similar looking smile to the next while the reverse expression is a scowling look. He has a new hair piece which was first used for Star-Lord if I&rsquo;m not mistaken. He comes with the same tranquilizer gun first seen in LEGO Jurassic World.</span></span></span></span></p>

That or possibly some shade of tan, it&rsquo;s a new colour and looks great to differentiate the two versions released between the two films.</span></span></span></span></p>

Her clothes is the same blue tone and her dark vest has a lot of similar pouches and belts printed over it, this is a generic torso though, not gender specific. She is female though as her head is shared between the female ACU from the first film and other characters. I think the print first appeared on Pepper Potts from Iron Man 3.</span></span></span></span></p>

A small nest, or an extra vehicle like a Motorcycle for Owen to ride may have been welcome here, but I&rsquo;d still recommend this set if you&rsquo;re a fan of the LEGO Jurassic World theme and are interested in getting everything LEGO Jurassic World. Highly Recommended for fans. Marginally recommended for casual collectors who would prefer something a bit more exciting for their models.</span></span></span></span></p>

"LegoHobbitFan","2019-08-25T15:47:32.027Z","Pteranodon chase","<p>This Jurassic World set has 126 pieces and costs about $20. This means that the price per piece is 15.9 cents, normally not a great deal. Of course, the reason for this is that the set contains a pteranodon in a nice olive green and dark red color scheme. It is very well molded and has excellent printing. Beyond this there is a small truck to chase it and two minifigures; Owen Grady and a generic female tracker. Both minifigures are nice, but owen is pretty common and the tracker is nothing special. The truck contains a net-shooting cannon intended to trap the dino, but it doesn&#39;t work very well. The rest of the truck is pretty nice, it only has about 100 pieces so is fairly straightforward and simple. It nonetheless is a pretty neat model. However it alone is not worth the price, so the only real reason to buy the set is for the pteranodon. I hope you find this review helpful!</p>
