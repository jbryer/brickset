<p>The Stygimoloch steals the show for not only this set but for the entire wave of jurassic&nbsp;world fallen kingdom sets as well. It&#39;s a new and refreshing mould and a great addition to your dinosaur collection, should you have one. It&#39;s about the same size as the raptors&nbsp;with the same amount of movement built into it. Overall, I don&#39;t feel guilty buying this set just for this fantastic little beast.</p>

<p>The Build</p>

<p>When looking at this set, I originally dismissed it as a shameless rehash of the already successful raptor escape set from 2015, just with one less dinosaur and no vehicle this time. However, upon actually opening it and building it, I came to the conclusion that this was so much better. The pen is built to seem a lot more secure as well as improving on the awkward balcony area from that raptor escape set by turning it into its own section as well! Now below that, there&#39;s actually a lab for Dr. Wu to do his research as well as an action feature being built into that. The stygimoloch can break through its pen and into the lab and from there, break out of the lab via a lab table. The original drawback to the build for me was the space, or lack there of, however after testing with 2 raptors, I can very happily assure you (and myself) that there&#39;s more than enough space to play around with inside, as well as a gate that can actually hold itself in place without any help. If you do happen to buy multiples of the set, you can easily connect them together to form a super pen of sorts and expand the enclosure (as well as to get more of that cool stygimoloch!</p>

<p>The Minifigures</p>

<p>The minifigures in this set feature Dr. Wu and an unnamed ACU trooper to make sure the dinosaur doesn&#39;t escape. Both figures look extremely nice and the alternate face for Dr. Wu is really useful for custom minifigures.</p>

<p>Price</p>

<p>The price per part ratio in this set isn&#39;t that great, however in terms of what you actually get, this feels like a $30 set to me. In Singapore, this set is $70 which is a bit expensive considering the exchange rate is $30=40.96 but it&#39;s still worth it.</p>

<p>Verdict</p>

<p>This is probably my favourite set from this wave and you really get what you pay for, a great dinosaur, a great build and a decent selection of minifigures. This will make a great gift for any kid and I suggest to buy this set fast, it&#39;s leaving the shelves very quickly!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set comes with a lot of parts.&nbsp; There&nbsp;aren&#39;t too many fiddly parts in it.&nbsp; There are very few unique parts.&nbsp; This set gets a lot of mileage from common parts.&nbsp; This is what i would call a kitchen table build.&nbsp; It has a&nbsp;small set of stickers.&nbsp; Make sure you position them right.&nbsp; These are some of the stickers with the really strong glue on them, once they touch a part they aren&#39;t coming off.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build even though i mess up several times was quite enjoyable.&nbsp; I would say that if you have an extra brick separator lying around you might want to grab it.&nbsp; There&#39;s enough parts that i sometimes found myself skipping around because i couldn&#39;t find the piece i needed right then.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the most part this a terrific looking set.&nbsp; It does have a few noticeable gaps in the walls in a few places.&nbsp; There are two well disguised action features.&nbsp; These are collapsible walls.&nbsp; One nice thing is in the right light, the translucent&nbsp;yellow pieces&nbsp;in the gate are have a subtle glow, giving the impression of warning lights.&nbsp; The mini-figs are all right.&nbsp; Just one face print.&nbsp; Dr. Wu is a nice print, but that print feels a bit generic.&nbsp; The guard is a very nice print (the first time i put his cap on, it just refused to go on).&nbsp; But with his grizzled face print, and the guard suit print, that reminds me of Agent of Shield, you could start wandering how Steve Rogers&nbsp;got into Jurasic Park.</p>
