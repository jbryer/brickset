<p>When the Lego group began to release images of the Fallen Kingdom set, this was the only set from the entire wave that I needed in my collection. I was amazed by the actual size of the Helicopter and how many details were infused in the set. The entire movie was centered around protecting the dinosaurs on Isla Nublar, which was executed perfectly in this set. The designers used immense focus to make this set highly movie accurate. I was astonished at the simplicity with the model and the fun ceased to subside.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What I enjoyed about the set:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The main aspect of the model I really liked was the function of spinning the Helicopter blade. This was the first Lego set, besides Technic, to incorporate the ability to spin the blade so the the builder can fly with the model. By having the gear under the main body of the Helicopter allowed the model to look very sleek and aerodynamic. I was amazed at how the designers could make this model not only playable but highly elegant as well. It is not common for Jurassic World designers to make sets look so gorgeous and become extremely durable to play with. There is a lot of space in the model, making any person excited to help save Blue.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What I disliked about the set:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>There is not much I do not like about the set, but I do not like the cage for Blue. It has been shown during both Jurassic World movies that all the animals are transported by rope for Helicopters or heavy duty cages. This cage is both physically and aesthetically flimsy. It seems as though Blue could have fallen out when they started the Helicopter. I would have paid an extra fie dollars for a much larger cage to hold Blue. It would have been very useful have this addition to make the play experience a lot more accurate and enjoyable.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Would I recommend this set:</b></h2>

<p>I would extremely recommend this set to any person. No matter what theme of Lego an individual enjoys, this set incorporates both functional features and aesthetic elements that would make any Lego fan ecstatic about Jurassic World. This franchise is legendary and this set only adds to the significance of the series for all ages. This set is incredible to play with and can be used for any Lego city scenario. Even the ATV for Owen is an amazing vehicle to transport any person throughout the town or off roading. I cannot wait for the future of this series not only on-screen but in Lego form.&nbsp;</p>
