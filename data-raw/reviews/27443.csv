<p>Jurassic world fallen kingdom may have been overshadowed by Avengers Infinity War, but that has not stopped Lego from putting put heaps of bricks for this all knew line. This set had a lot of criticism for the truck, but is it that bad? Let&#39;s find out...</p>

<h3>Box and instructions</h3>

<p>The set comes in quite a small box for a set of it&#39;s size, about as big as that of the avenjet&nbsp;space mission. There are two medium sized instruction booklets, which span about 130 pages together. Sorry about the lack of images, I will try to fix that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures&nbsp;</h3>

<p>OWEN is unique to this set, with a ripped shirt and the new Chris Pratt head. He has printed dark blue legs and creases in his shirt on the back.</p>

<p>CLAIRE is also included and sports updated hair and a double sided face. The angry and determined expressions are perfect for the figure. This is also the cheapest way to get her.</p>

<p>FRANKLIN WEBB is exclusive to this set completely. He has a very useful polo jacket combo, a double sided head and the hair found on Falcon and Finn.</p>

<h3>Dinos</h3>

<p>The CARNOTAURUS is a reason many will buy this set. It reuses the Indominus&nbsp;Rex body and tail. The head is a new mould that I think has been excecuted to perfection. However the Dino is too big! It is the same height as the T Rex and the Indominus. This is a fair compromise for play though. This set also includes the adorable BABY DINO. To me it looks like a T. rex, but could double up as a Carnotaurus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The models</h3>

<p>The TRUCK/MOBILE COMMAND CENTRE is almost exactly the&nbsp;same size as the one in Raptor Rampage. However this does not feature the way too bright blue found in the latter. The mobile command is small yet does the job. For unknown reasons, you can pose a figure through the roof.</p>

<p>The GYROSPHERE&nbsp;STATION is perfect. The trees are good and the sign is a twist with the figure rather than a person. It therefore can fit as an actual Jurassic world station.</p>

<p>The GYROSPHERE&nbsp;is the same as 2015 just with rust. Enough said.</p>

<p>Overall this set is a good one. It has play and display quality. The price is good but in the us 80 bucks is slightly too much. Look out for more reviews!</p>

"DrBrickZi","2020-04-22T10:59:36.843Z","Favourite set for Jurassic World theme","<p>As a fan of Jurassic Park and Jurassic World,&nbsp;this is an awesome set for a Jurassic theme park!</p>

<p>I like how the whole set depicts a&nbsp;scene in the movie &quot;Jurassic World&quot;, especially the Carnotaurus and Gyrosphere!</p>

<p>Really had fun building this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I like the Jurassic theme truck as well.&nbsp;it is playable inside the spacious truck and it has an attach to carry the gyrosphere. there are also interactions with the tree-like structure in the set. it can house the gyrosphere as well. 2 spaces to house the gyrosphere, so no need to worry about it rolling away like a hamster ball. =)</p>

<p>It is pricey but worth it given the pieces, especially with the Carnotaurus.</p>

<p>This is a very&nbsp;special set to me because my wife bought this for me as a&nbsp;present&nbsp;back in 2018, after we watched the movie! My favourite set for a Jurassic theme.</p>
