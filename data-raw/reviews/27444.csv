(sadly most of them have a misprint on the left eye, including mine) Blue the raptor is included as well but also comes in the Blue&#39;s Helicopter Rescue set.. He looks pretty good. The star of the set, the Indoraptor I think is just about perfect. I LOVE the head sculpt , which is complete with lots of sharp teeth. She reuses the Indominus Rex&#39;s arms and hands in black,&nbsp;which work out perfectly. I also love the print on the body for the scales. They are only visible under certain lighting conditions, but thankfully are much more visible than the black on black print of Lloyd Garmodon and Black Panther. She is super articulated, which allows her to get into some amazing poses!</p>

<p>Although I like the selection of 6 characters we get in this set,&nbsp;only 2 are exclusive. (Gunnar Eversol and Masie Lockwood.) As stated in my other reviews, Owen Grady looks fantastic and is a great improvement over the 2015 one. He also comes with an axe.&nbsp;Clair Dearing is also a pretty good looking figure. I love her scared expression but the other one just looks weird. Ken Wheatley is yet another pretty good figure. I love the torso printing and the dark tan&nbsp;baseball cap works out perfectly. I&#39;m not sure how accurate his face print is though. A tranquilizer gun is included for his accessory. Eli Mills is a very bland figure IMO.&nbsp; He reuses 100% of his parts, it would have been so nice to get a new face print because the one LEGO used is very inaccurate. A walkie-talkie completes the figure. &nbsp;Masie Lockwood is pretty good figure. She uses the same happy/sad child face LEGO has put on a number of figures. I like her torso print and dark orange hair. Gunnar Eversol is another great figure. I love his face prints, which&nbsp;are very accurate. He comes with a brick built gabble, which is an absolute necessity when fighting dinosaurs.</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build for this set is the Lockwood Mansion. It does not represent any specific part of Lockwood Manor but&nbsp;features many important details such as the chimneys.&nbsp;I am super disappointed with it as it mainly uses panels and bricks and has extremely little play value and detail. It looks pretty plain from the outside, with the only major detailing coming from two 1 x&nbsp;5 x 6 panels with giant stickers on them. I wish there was some foliage around the base of the mansion. Also, there should be various colors besides tan&nbsp;to represent weathering.&nbsp;&nbsp;The build gets very repetitive at points too, especially when putting together the 24 total windows. There are hardly ANY interesting techniques used as like I said earlier, most of the build is just panels and bricks. The interior space is also very plain and feels cramped. There are some flowers and red vases on the bottom floor as well as two removable display cases. I like the idea, but the displays are just represented by giant stickers. I wish they had made them a stud more wide so they could have put some actual foliage in front of the stickers. All the windows in the mansion can be busted out from the inside. The 2nd floor features a lab. I do like the various&nbsp;brick built machines included. I&nbsp;especially like&nbsp;the computer screen sticker with a LEGO claw piece and the Indoraptor on it. The whole lab section is extremely cramped. The third floor has 3 rooms. One has an umbrella stand with a minifig umbrella piece reused from Penguin from The LEGO Batman Movie as well as a desk with a printed 2 x 2 map and desk lamp. The middle room is empty but has a door to get access to the balcony which is pretty decent and will fit two figures. The last room has Masie&#39;s bed. It can be lifted up for her to hide under. If you bust the window out, you can recreate the scene seen in the trailer with the Indoraptor sticking it&#39;s head through the window while Masie is hiding in the bed. The two display cases and the two sides of the mansion can be removed and reconfigured. It is a pretty useless feature&nbsp;as&nbsp;it really only looks good in the configuration shown on the box.There is also a feature&nbsp;where you pull out a&nbsp;technic pin on the roof while the&nbsp;Indoraptor is standing on&nbsp;it and make it appear that the Indoraptor is busting in through the windows. I actually&nbsp;like that feature although I wish the window assembly would tilt farther down.&nbsp;Also included is a fantastic brick built Triceratops Skull which can be placed in the museum area and a green motorcycle for Owen, like was seen in the first Jurassic World Movie.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So overall, not a great set at all. I love the Indoraptor and the 6 figures included are pretty good, (aside from Eli Mills) however it just does not seem worth $130. I would have MUCH preferred a smaller, more complete&nbsp;build with many more details. I have a feeling that either an inexperienced designer worked on this or else the designer built it as fast as he could. Even I could have done a much better job designing this set! Another thing is&nbsp;I actually got pretty bored building it, which is something that never happens with other sets.&nbsp;So again, I like the figures and especially the Indoraptor, but the build is just terrible. I would therefor not recommend this set unless you are just wanting the figures, dinosaurs, or parts.</p>
