<p>now you build the build to make it a battle pack which is in my view is just a playable canon that is just in there to make it a battle pack so i think now we need to just put the minifigures in a battle pack where you get just the figures in blister pack for only like 5 pouds to make it so you can army build more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<br />
THE GOOD THE BAD AND THE UGLY</p>

<p>1+good figures</p>

<p>-1 bad build</p>

<p>1+cheap way to get spring loaded shooter</p>

<p>-1 LAME crew member in it</p>

<p>+1 for its play use</p>

<p>SCORE</p>

<p>the score does 3 for the good and 2 for the bad so it just barely escaped average rating so out of ten i would give it</p>

<p>6/10</p>

<p>thank you for viewing</p>

<p>P.S Lego get rid of that LAME crew member<br />

Originally, following the instructions, only 1 of my Executioners had a staff weapon. The other went into the &#39;extra parts&#39; bin. Glad I saw the picture here so that I can dig them out.<br />
<br />
The four-legged cannon &quot;throw-in&quot; is nothing special and seems to be quite similar to other battlepack &quot;throw-ins&quot; typical with these bad guy sets. I do hope to one day see a Snoke Throne Room set for these Executioners to have a home.</p>

"LMGAMER01","2018-01-17T17:35:09.217Z","A Battlepack as usual","<p>Im&nbsp;pretty much getting more and more Star Wars&nbsp;Sets and thought it would be a good idea doing my first review on something&nbsp;small.</p>

<p>The First Order Specialist Battle Pack recommended ages 6-12 &nbsp;contains Minifigures which represent unnamed Characters from Star Wars&nbsp;episode IX and a medium sized Laser-Canon.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging &amp; Instructions</strong></p>

<p>A usual small Batllepack&nbsp;Box with punch-hole opening. On the front you can see the Minifigures&nbsp;storming in to battle which is not really lore accurate, the Executioners weren&acute;t soldiers on the battlefield they were stationed on large Ships and facilitys&nbsp;to kill traitors or Resistance Members also the &quot;Shuttle Pilot&quot; is using the canon and the Gunner is running into battle I&nbsp;do not know how something like this can happen but it would have been easy to show the Minifigures&nbsp;in a accurate way.&nbsp;On top you an see a &quot;First Order Stormtrooper Executioner&quot; On the back there is pretty much the same picture as on the front and two&nbsp;small pictures showing the rotation and shooting feature off the Laser-Canon.</p>

<p><strong>Build &amp; Parts</strong></p>

<p>As usual with Battlepacks the parts are not that great but the inclusion of the fairly new &quot;Roof Tile 1X2 ( 6168776)&quot; in &quot;Dark Bluish Gray&quot; is nice. The Build process was easy and short but still fun. The canon&nbsp;looks a lot like previous ones out of Battlepacks, a spring loaded shooter is integrated.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>As usual they still have Studshooters&nbsp;which i still do not like.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The two exclusive &quot;First Order Executioners Executioners&quot; are great and look really cool they have a laser-axe or something like that and like all Minifigures&nbsp;a Studshooter-Gun. The &quot;First Order Shuttle Pilot&quot; is also nice to get in a cheap set like this. But there is one Problem the &quot;First Order Crew Member/Gunner&quot; on of the worst Minifigures&nbsp;currently on the market.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>The Turret isn&acute;t a very great design for display but for kids which are the main buyers of sets like this it is great. You can rotate the Turret 360 degree and a little bit up and down, on top of the Turret is a springloaded shooter.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>The set is nice for collectors of Minifigures&nbsp;and kids who&nbsp;want to play with it but the model itself is not great for display and will go into my drawer where all the other Battlepack models are. If you like the Minifigures you should get it but it would probably be better to wait for a sale.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-11-30T23:51:32.057Z","We don't want gunner figures in battlepacks","<p>What can I say. WE DON&#39;T WANT AN ARMY OF FIRST ORDER GUNNERS! I don&#39;t know why LEGO is so obsessed with throwing this terrible first order gunner into these battle packs. The First Order Executioners are really good but there is only 2 of them. I wouldn&#39;t be as mad if they threw in 2 first order stormtroopers in this instead of the gunners, in fact that would make it an amazing battle pack. The turret design is also unoriginal as it is very similar to the turret included in the senate commandos battle pack but it does give you some cool pieces including some trans-red pieces which are cool and not easy to come by. I would only recommend buying 1 of this set if you have money to spare, if you don&#39;t have lots of money, then save your money for a better set.</p>

"Struhadlo","2020-04-01T09:00:40.913Z","Where did the good battle packs go?","<p>2018 was not a particularly strong year for Star Wars and it for sure was not a strong year for Lego Star Wars Battle Packs. With the release of such gems such as <strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75206-1/Jedi-and-Clone-Troopers-Battle-Pack"" target=""_blank"">75206</a>&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75198-1/Tatooine-Battle-Pack"" target=""_blank"">75198</a>&nbsp;</strong>one would probably not hope for a decent Battle Pack. And one would be right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a mixed bag&nbsp;of a set because it is one of the cases where the set would do far better was it not branded as a Battle Pack.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>

<p>The minifig selection is a bread and butter of a Battle Pack and putting 3 different minifigs into a Battle Pack never resulted in a warm welcome by the fan base. And I do not mean different colour variations such is the case with&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7655-1/Clone-Troopers-Battle-Pack"" target=""_blank"">7655</a>.&nbsp;</strong>That is a gold standard for a Battle Pack and Lego should really learn from their past.</p>

<ul>
	<li>The Executioner Trooper. Now this is an excellent minifig. The print is different than on a regular First Order Trooper. The torso print is pretty similar but there is a hint of a black shirt under the armour in the neck and shoulder area. The same logic applies to the back print. Legs are identical and arms are just plain black without any additional printing done. If you do not own any First Order troopers for a reference, then I can assure you that this is a perfectly alright print with all the details you need. The helmet is again quite similar except for the black line on the right side. It is a nice distinction from a regular trooper. It looks mean and adds to the aggressive feel from this trooper. The executioner comes&nbsp;much to everyone&#39;s dismay&nbsp;with a stud shooter and much to everyone&#39;s delight with an electric axe. The axe is made out of 3 pieces and you can replace the blade with anything you fancy. These guys have angry clone face. Pro tip: If you want your minifig to hold the staff in both hands, just turn the hand which holds the weapon on the bottom around so that the hands face each other with their pinky fingers.</li>
	<li>First Order Shuttle Pilot. I had to look up this minifig because I had no idea what it was&nbsp;and I did not care. Now I just do not care. There is only a vague print on the torso and on the back. There is no printing done on the arms, legs or waist. If anyone were to tell me that this is a minifig from 2002, I would belive them. Except for the single facial expression face which has a skin colour and a microphone print. The helmet is accurate to the picture and thusly it still looks dumb. I think I speak for everybody here when I say that nobody needs an army builder with these guys. To add the salt to the injury, he is armed with a stud shooter.</li>
	<li>First Order Crew Member. This guy has the same print as the previous one. The only difference is the generic face without any special print and the helmet. The helmet is completely closed here and it looks like some morbid torture head device from the Silent Hill. If this minifig came with a horror-themed print it would be a solid nightmare fuel material. Well if it were converted into an actual character in a movie or a game. Minifigs cannot really look spooky. And again our useless randy is armed with a stud shooter.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>The build is a 360 degree spinning turret with a spring-loaded shooter. The inclusion of spring-loaded shooter makes for a fun Battle Pack build. There are some complaints about them but Lego is a toy and as such its primary&nbsp;target audience are kids. And I think this is fun little feature which is far better than a stud shooter on such turret. There is a small handle on the side for a weapon storage. The laser canon can lean 45 degrees forward and 45 degrees backward.</p>

<p>Building the legs is obviously redundant as there are 4 identical legs, but since it is such a small build it creates no tediousness.</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>Stud God damn shooters. They do not add any playability as they are incredibly difficult to shoot while keeping the minifig stand still, and they are just as painful to re-load. And they look incredibly stupid since they are basically the same size as the minifig torso. The spring-loaded shooter is a welcomed feature though.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>This is not all that awful of a Battle Pack. If it had regular blasters and one more executioner instead of the crew member it would an easy 4 out of 5. Had it come with 4 executioners it would be an even easier 5 out of 5. The build is actually the saving grace of this mess and the Executioner Troopers look fantastic. But it is the inclusion of two absolutely useless and horrendously printed minifigs and stud shooters which make this set what it is. A shameless mess which makes me sad since it was not all that far from being a perfect set.</p>
