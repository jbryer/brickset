<p>The build for the set includes one of island huts with a well detailed and playable interior with bed, kitchen area and toilet. The hut also has a detachable roof for easy access to the inside also there is a exploding feature on the side. Beside the hut build there are two extra areas with a fire pit and a rock falling feature&nbsp;from a scene of the movie.</p>

<p>The minifigs&nbsp;included are a Porg&nbsp;,which is different from the previous one with a gray body. you also get a long waited sequel trilogy Luke Skywalker, which besides being a bit inaccurate is a great figure to get in a cheap set. the last minifigure&nbsp;is a new training version of Rey which is also a great figure.</p>

<p>Overall this set is very well done and is a nice build and a great set to get from the last Jedi with great new minifigs. The only issues i have with the set are the price being a bit high and the inaccuracy&nbsp;of the Luke minifig, but overall a fantastic set and I highly recommend it.</p>

"abordoli","2018-01-11T05:09:36.023Z","Near Perfection!","<p>This set is chock full of features and playability for its rather small area. The Luke Skywalker figure is absolutely amazing, but I feel that for Porg figure I felt could have been done in two-pieces (torso and head) rather than a constructed torso. I am not a huge fan of lose parts like carrots and fish in buckets, but they won&#39;t spill out of their containers unless you&#39;re being particularly rough during play.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I feel that this is the pinnacle set for The Last Jedi movie and I can certainly tell you that it is hard to find so call your retailers ahead to have them hold one for you if in stock. Also, don&#39;t trust retailers that say that &quot;We have everything&quot;, because my experience when I was trying to get this is that when you get into the store they&#39;ll give you the &quot;We have everything - as long as it&#39;s on our shelf&quot; rigamorole.</p>

"vikings","2020-06-21T06:53:13.19Z","Ahch-To Island Training","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a medium size box. The dimensions of the box are 10.3 x 7.5 x 2.4 inches and weighs 0.86 pounds. You get a small/medium instruction booklet as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some really nice parts in this set. You get two black bowls, a clear cup, a fish, a green cherry, three&nbsp;trans orange stud with a hole, a trans orange flame, trans light blue crystal, two 2x10x2 light grey roof tiles, a couple different larger green plates, the top and bottom of a dark grey rock, and a dark brown soft cloth&nbsp;over the door way. You get 5 stickers all of the stone work on the house/hut. The total piece count for the set is 241.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Old Luke:</strong></p>

<p>This is an exclusive figure only to this set. I was really happy to get Luke in his Old or Sequel form. He has a long messy dark tan hair which looks nice. He has a doubled sided head. On the front you have neutral expression with a dark tan beard. On the other side he has an angry facial expression. He has a dark tan cape and printing on both sides of his torso. On the front you have a white and tan Jedi robes with a brown belt with a silver buckle and a brown pack. On the back you have white and tan robes and the brown belt. You get white legs with printing on it. You have the white and tan robes continue on down from the torso. He has a light grey stick with a tan scope to make his staff.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rey (Jedi Training):</strong></p>

<p>You get Rey in her Jedi training version. She has her normal dark brown hair. She has a double-sided head. On one side she has a neutral expression and on the other side she has a slightly angry expression. She has printing on both sides of her torso. On the front she has a dark tan jacket with a light grey shirt with a couple of brown strings (or something like that) as well. On the back you have some markings showing the dark tan jacket. She has dark grey legs with some printing on it. She has a little brown strap with a couple knee pad (like) on her knees. She has both her staff (short black stick and two black lightsaber hilts) and Luke&#39;s/Rey&#39;s lightsaber.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Porg:</strong></p>

<p>You get a brick built Porg. The Porg is built out of 7 pieces. The pieces you get are an orange stud, a white half circle tile, a 1x1 dark grey brick with four knobs, two&nbsp;dark grey 1/4 tile, and 1x1 dark grey roof tile. You also get the dome head with the printing of the orange, white, and light grey fur colors of the Porg head. You get the two big eyes and its mouth is frowning.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was pretty easy and straight forward. The build took me around 20 minutes to build. You have three parts to the set. The two outdoor sections are individual and can unattached from the main build of the hut. Overall a fairly simple build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a really good set. The figures are great to get and really capture what you get in the movie with these scenes that take place on Ahch-To. Getting the brick built Porg is great (if your like me and love the Porgs) and will be one of your favorite things about the set.&nbsp;The hut itself is great. The interior is amazing and you get a lot of good pieces in their. You have a small table where you have a cup and a lamp (like thing). You can remove the top of it where the cherry is stored. You have a brown bag where&nbsp;the fish is and a black bowl. You have a bed that can fold up against the wall creating some nice space in the hut. You can remove the roof of the hut which is really nice for getting better access inside the hut. You have the dark brown soft fabric piece on the front of the hut which looks great. You have a couple play features. A small part of the wall can pop off and then you have the rock/boulder and the brick built circle that spins 360 degrees that Rey can train on. I highly recommend getting this set (Not for the price of 30 USD) if you can. This will make a nice addition to anyones Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Japanbuilder","2018-01-22T02:22:21.547Z","And now it is awake! ","<p>Finally, we get a set with one of the most sought after figures we never got from the TFA line up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Does the set and the figures live up to the expectation? Let&#39;s read on!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Presentation:</strong></p>

<p>We get a great box. I love the design as it harkens to the overall color scheme of the planet of Crait. Something which appeared pivotal in the trailers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4614/38928481055_fb5566bc8e.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>Inside we get 2 bags a manual and a small sticker sheet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4631/38928480535_8b127358d0.jpg[/img]</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>In bag 1 we get the star attraction Jedi Master Luke. He looks rather worn with age here but the two expressions are great and the hair piece plus bigger cape do him justice here in LEGO form. We also get a Porg and he is actually quite a nice addition once in hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4714/38928482415_2e3bc53543.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>In Bag 2 we get Rey. She features the outfit we saw her in at the end of TFA and it has transferred well here. This is actually the first Rey I personally own and I have to say the likeness is very good in LEGO form. I love the prints on her torso and legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>Nothing fancy here. Just put the blocks together as shown.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you are done this will be about what your spare piece count looks like:</p>

<p>[img]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4708/38928484365_bc9cd09abb.jpg[/img]</p>

<p><strong>The completed model:</strong></p>

<p>This set is very nice looking. Despite its low piece count and simplicity there is a fair bit going on here to really get some play going on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We get a practice area for Rey complete with rock which you can slice just like the commercials. We get a porg, and we get Luke to instruct Rey on the ways of the Jedi. They can even spar together or cook that prog since we get a few spots for cooking. The cloth on the outside of the hut is not accurate but it works here, it gives it that hut feeling. It is a nice little display piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>If you want an older Jedi Master Luke this set is a must buy. For younger fans this set is also great as it comes with plenty to do and a way to live just a regular day in the life of Luke and&nbsp;Rey. It is essentially a miniature doll house but for Jedi play. Overall great. Just the price is a bummer.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">This set is very similar to Yodas hut. Released the same year, almost the same number of pieces, three minifigures, two bags with the pieces, almost the same number of building steps, based on the same concept (training and a hut) and almost the same size. Instead of the two hinged pieces on Yodas hut, this hut uses a brick with two technic pins and a technic beam in the hut.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">There are some differences. This set is from the sequel trilogy and Yodas hut is from the original trilogy. Yodas hut is in Dagaboh, a swamp, and this hut is in Ahch-To island in the ocean. The hut in this set is squarer than Yodas rounded hut. The colors are also very different, and this set has four stickers.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">The hut is easy to build because you use tall roof pieces and bricks. </span></span></span></p>

A rare and exclusive piece.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">The underside of the hut is strange. There is one large plate on each side, but nothing in the middle. There is no large plate in the middle, not even a black 1x6 plate. It is just an empty space.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">This set has a hut and two removeable fields, which can connect to either side or the front.

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">The shape of the hut looks amazing and accurate to the movie. It is using very many roof pieces in different shapes and sizes to build the walls and the roof. The hut uses two different colors of stone-grey and sand yellow color for the details. The hut also uses tooth pieces and plate with slide pieces to break up the shape. Profile brick is also used to make the details of the hut. The hut uses four stickers to indicate a stone finished and are placed on different places. I decided to not apply them, because the hut looks nicer and cleaner without. The door is a cloth piece, which is not accurate to the movie. It should be a large metal door instead.</span></span></span></p>

The bed is also nice, and it can fold up 90 degree, because of the wall element behind it. You can also take out the table and get access to a storage space. I like the shiny fish piece and it is telling that this hut is by the ocean.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">The field in front of the hut is nice, because you can have an outdoor place with a firepit where Rey and Luke can sit and talk. The field to the side is where Rey can practice. There is a turntable and a loose rock with a crystal inside.</span></span></span></p>

There is an action feature in the back where a part of the wall can be knocked away. There is also a removeable roof which give better access to the inside.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">There is one big problem with some of these features. The hut is difficult to pick up and move. This is because of the removeable roof and the loose wall piece (playing feature). The roof is only secure with two studs on one side. It should have two studs on the other side also. </span></span></span></p>

You can pull a lever on the back of the set to make a part of the wall fall down. You can also push a boulder off of the ground. The inside of the hut has a bed and a little cooking era. Inside the boulder there is a gem. Now for my opinions. This set is a good set but I wish it came with at least 3 porgs. It would also be better if the hut was a little bigger. This is a good set and you should get it if you find a good deal.</p>
