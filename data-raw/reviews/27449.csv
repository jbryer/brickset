"Koot","2017-12-28T02:23:49.65Z","LEGO Star Wars 75201 First Order AT-ST","<p>This set features the scene in Star Wars - The Last Jedi where BB-8 takes control of an AT-ST walker. The main model is an AT-ST walker with almost the entire head gone, and also includes a elevated platform.</p>

<p><strong>The Model/s:</strong></p>

<p>The walker itself is very similar to that of set 75153 AT-ST (Rogue One), except the head almost gone. This ruins any displayable value this set could have had. I find the front cannon&nbsp;too large and off-putting - the spring-loaded shooters are very exposed. The legs have (limited) articulation, but it is quite useless as the legs can only stand in one position. Like the other AT-ST, turning the knob at the back of the walker will rotate the head.</p>

<p>The &#39;platform&#39; the set comes with, in my opinion, was just made to add to the piece count. It does not represent any particular thing from Star Wars - The Last Jedi and has limited play value.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>The addition of Finn and Rose in disguise definitely adds some value&nbsp;- they are both exclusive to the set. Although Captain Phasma is not exclusive, we only saw it in 75103 First Order Troop Transporter, so it is still a good figure to get. We have seen BB-8 many times now, so there is nothing really special about him.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>As this set is the same price as the Rogue One AT-ST (that actually has a head), this set is very poor. It has limited play value, pretty mediocre price/part, and would honestly be more suited as a joke than a real set you have to pay good money for. If you want the set, wait for it to go on sale, so you get less of a bad deal.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and I hope this was very helpful.</p>

The Captain Phasma figure is great, but it has a black head wherefore I wish they had a female head instead (especially if they could closely resemble it to the Game of Thrones actress that played as this character). You also get Rose and Finn in disguise.</p>

<p>The AT-ST vehicle itself seemed a bit &quot;stiff&quot; in that it did have that much articulation in the legs, but there is a feature to swivel the upper-platform with some Technic-gearing. I also feel that the legs could have done with some more detailing to cover up more of the Technic-holed parts.</p>

Sure the name implies that it might be a complete AT-ST, but there is all kinds of pictures that show you exactly what you are getting. I like this set because the scene&nbsp;in TLJ is funny, Awesome, and very exciting.</p>

<p><strong>Mini-figures</strong></p>

<p>Finn-It&#39;s great to get Finn in this First Order disguise. He looks quite accurate and is exclusive. He has no alternate face because of the short hat, but his head is new.</p>

<p>Rose-Rose looks just as good as Finn and her hair/hat piece is very cool and her torso is exclusive.</p>

<p>Captain Phasma- She looks striking as she did before but her cape&#39;s black part is printed much better. Her helmet has been changed to be like TLJ stormtroopers&#39;&nbsp;helmets</p>

<p>BB-8- Same as always</p>

<p><strong>Builds</strong></p>

<p>The elevator thing is okay and the locking mechanism is cool. This wasn&#39;t in the movie at all but kind of cool</p>

<p>The AT-ST is great for what it is. The legs are similar&nbsp;to the 2016 version but the head is quite different because BB-8 has accidently ripped the head armor off. The moving head knob works quite well, and the legs pose even better than the 2016 one because the head weighs less</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I personally like this set quite a lot. Reviewers say that it should have been an AT-ST with a whole head, but I would not have boughten it if it was the exact same as the last AT-ST.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would recommend this&nbsp;</p>
