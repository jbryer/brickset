I am a huge Incredibles&nbsp;fan and I wanted to get more figures from the Parr family. Once I saw the pictures of the sets, I was a little underwhelmed by the builds, but I was still really excited.</p>

<p>This is the smallest of the three juniors sets, but it looks the least &quot;juniorized&quot; of all of them. The build for the rooftop reminds me of the 76044 Clash of Heroes set from DC, though this is larger. There is a place to land the helicopter and some roof top detailing such as a fan and a satellite dish. I can easily see someone creating a skyscraper moc and putting this on top as the roof. The motorcycle is nothing too special, but it is a nice inclusion. The helicopter is a&nbsp;simple build, using the juniors helicopter mold, but it still looks good. The printed parts in this set are good in quality and they really add a lot to this set. I am confused however if the print for the billboard on it means if the approval ratting for superheroes is 18% nationally, or if it means that the approval rating is up 18% from what it used to be.</p>

<p>The two minifigures are great in this set. The Screen slaver&nbsp;has a cool, new mold for the helmet&nbsp;and looks very accurate to what we saw in one of the trailers. Elastigirl/ Mrs. Incredible is perfect. The &quot;stretchy&quot; arms are perfect for her. I wish that they would have brought back the legs used on the Woody minifigure from the toy story line to show her legs stretching, but the legs included are just fine.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great set, but not necessary if you want to get the entire Parr family. An Elastigirl&nbsp;minifigure&nbsp;comes in the $25 set, but not with the stretchy arms. I think that this set is great for people of all ages and it is a nice inclusion to anyone&#39;s collection.</p>

Anyway as a fan of Disney I decided to get these sets for the rest of the family and other interesting characters. As a Juniors set though it&rsquo;s still fairly impressive looking and this review will, again, attempt to discuss the set from the prospective of parents.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: This is a great looking box with some awesome action shots on the front and back. It&rsquo;s that nice red colour for Juniors as a Theme with the Easy To Build sub-title visible so you know this set is great for 4-7 year olds, though I&rsquo;d hesitate to buy these sets for older builders. I&rsquo;m just not sure they&rsquo;d have as much fun with them as 4 year olds.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: Very simple to follow along with and with a fun little comic story in the back showing what&rsquo;s happening for these characters in the set, very well designed booklet.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Again, with most Juniors sets there are unique printed elements instead of stickers because of the way these sets are produced and designed. Younger builders just don&rsquo;t enjoy stickers I guess&hellip; Oh who am I kidding a lot of us don&rsquo;t like the use of stickers in LEGO. (I guess it never really bothered me so much because I also collect Transformers and G1 figures had you apply stickers all the time, same with G.I.Joe.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ahem, anyway, I digress. This set features a very large tile piece with Elastigirl on it and some information on her popularity as seen in the film. I think this is the most sought after part from the set for MOC and AFOLs. The Helicopter Chassis seen in the Jurassic World also makes an appearance here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Elastigirl: This is only the second character to use the super elongated arms with torso Minifigure. Elastigirl features bendy arms, Ms. Marvel is the first character to feature these unique arm designs, the print on the torso is very nice capturing the look of Elastigirl. Unfortunately she doesn&#39;t quite match up with her on-screen counterpart who was wearing a different coloured outfit during these moments in the film.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">She has a dual-sided face and a small walkie talkie accessory which is meant to be a tracking and communication device in one.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Screenslaver: This character is the villain of the piece, or is he? Well I suppose so since he&rsquo;s the only one available in any of the three sets. He&rsquo;s got a plain looking torso print without too much detailing and a unique head element for the funky mask he was wearing. Unfortunately he doesn&rsquo;t include any accessories to hold.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a fairly simple build, the bulk of the construction involves making a small helipad and helicopter. The steps are very easy to follow along with for the age range, it&rsquo;s a bit better compared to the Pterandon Escape set I recently reviewed. Parts could be easily lost though as some of the small elements may disappear easily.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a nice looking model. It&rsquo;s meant to be based on the big battle scene when Screenslaver is first encountered. The Helicopter is also a solid piece and a bit of fun to play with. It&rsquo;s really difficult to discuss this honestly, it&rsquo;s probably a fun set to play with, but for display options it&rsquo;s a bit of a mess. There aren&rsquo;t as many features with this set as you&rsquo;d see in System models where the Helicopter would include flick-fire missiles and the landing pad would have some &lsquo;exploding&rsquo; element to damage when imagining the battle between heroes and villains.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a nice set as it does have some fun characters and elements. I&rsquo;d recommend it for folks looking for the unique character of Screenslaver and the fun play-feature enable stretchy Elastigirl. I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s the best representation for this Theme though, especially considering that the other two sets from Incredibles 2 are much better designed and involve more to play with. Mildly recommended.</p>

"TheMasksYT39","2020-07-05T16:53:44.33Z","Not That Accurate ","<p>Minifigures: The Screenslaver Is A Little Accurate But Not Really. Elastigirl Should&#39;ve Had Her Blue Suit Not Her Normal Suit.</p>

<p>Build: The Build Is Fine. The Only Part Of The Build That Is Accurate Is The Elasticycle.</p>

<p>Playability: The Only Playability Are The Wheels On The Elasticycle.</p>

<p>Value: Too Overpriced But I Guess Juiniours Sets Are Always Overpriced.</p>

<p>I Would Not Buy This Set You Should Buy The Underminer One Instead</p>
