I am a huge Incredibles&nbsp;fan and I wanted to get more figures from the Parr family. Once I saw the pictures of the sets, I was a little underwhelmed by the builds, but I was still really excited.</p>

<p>This set is great for people who like the First Incredibles and the second one. This scene depicts a scene that we see the beginning of in the end of the first Incredibles movie that is continued in the second, where the Underminer appears and starts to cause some trouble. The Underminer&#39;s vehicle is too simplified for my tastes, but I think that it works for a juniors set. Mr. Incredibles car from the beginning of the first movie is included and I think that it looks pretty good. I would have preferred it to have a roof, but I think that the convertible looks good for what it is. The bank build has a nice white parrot at the top and a nice print for the vault&nbsp;door. Everything else in the build seems a little plain and not to exciting. The side build of a portion of the wall is good for play, but I am confused by the wanted sign for the Underminer. He just seems to pop out of nowhere at the end of the first movie, so it doesn&#39;t make sense how he would have been known by the police so that they would make a wanted sign for him, but I think I am looking too deeply into this. There is also a light-pole for Mr. Incredible to throw around and a dolly&nbsp;for the underminer to carry away his loot with.</p>

<p>The minifigures are great in this set. The Mr. Incredible is different than the collectible series version of him, which is nice for collectors. Ms. Incredible has the same leg and torso print than the version of her that appears in 10759, but her face has different prints for both faces and she has normal arms. The Underminer is really well done. I think that his legs are too short, but the normal legs would have been too long. He has creepy small eyes that are covered by his helmet. I think that the pieces used to represent his metal hands are perfect for this character design.</p>

<p>Overall, this is not the best of the Incredibles wave, but it is redeemed by the minifigures included. I enjoy having this set and I think that kids will have a great time playing with it.</p>
