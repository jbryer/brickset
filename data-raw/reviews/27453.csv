I am a huge Incredibles&nbsp;fan and I wanted to get more figures from the Parr family. Once I saw the pictures of the sets, I was a little underwhelmed by the builds, but I was still really excited.</p>

<p>I think that this is the best of the Incredibles line of sets. The minifigures are fantastic and the build is fun to play with. I think that the build for the house is simple, but effective. The prints are great and the building looks pretty similar to what we see in the trailers. You can slide over the fireplace to reveal controls to access the Incredibles&nbsp;equivalent to the Bat-cave. The Incredibles-phone&nbsp;seems unnecessary, but it is a nice inclusion. I wish that they would have included one more drawer element&nbsp;in the table build underneath the phone, but that is just me nitpicking. The build for the pool is simple, but effective. The build for the lawn chair can also be used as a catapult to launch things at the villain of the set. Speaking of the&nbsp;villain, The Brick&#39;s car is a nice build of a truck. It includes a small catapult in the back to launch the brick-brick pieces included in the set.</p>

<p>Now there are 4 minifigures included in the set. Jack-Jack uses the baby mold from 2016 and he looks great. It would have been nice to have a hair piece for him or a print of the Indredibles Logo on his chest, but I think that the figure looks good as it is. Dash has nice tri-molded legs and his hairpiece is perfect for him. He comes with a water-gun and a skateboard. Violet has a nice new hairpiece that includes her hairband. She comes with a 4x4 round dish with a print on it to represent her force-field powers. The Brick is inaccurate to the movie, but she still looks great. She has a brick wall print on her torso and she has a nice dark red hairpiece that goes great with the dark orange used for her skin tone.</p>

<p>Overall, I think that this is the best of all the Incredibles 2 sets. It is &quot;juniorised&quot;, but it still looks great and has a lot of play value to it and will be very nice for kids to have.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-07-31T17:17:59.227Z","A Really Great set for Play","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #10761 The Great Home Escape:</b> This is one of the Incredibles 2 based sets from the Juniors sub-theme&hellip; or would Incredibles 2 be the sub-theme? Heh, either way it&rsquo;s another 4+ set with larger pieces, simpler builds and no stickers. This is the second set I picked up from this sub-theme and it is a must own set for collectors of the characters from Pixar because this is the only set to feature the three Parr children.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: The red boxes of Juniors are gone this year, which is a shame as the colour boxes helped keep track of things on the shelf a tad more organized. New 4+ boxes are still considered Juniors, the name however has been retired and folded into the Themes that proved the most popular. Anyway this box is a good design and it&rsquo;s a shame to see it retired because it serves its job well showing off the set and the features.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: The manual includes all of the necessary steps for building the set based on the numbered bag style of LEGO construction. A very solid manual with no difficult points for understanding.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As noted there are larger parts used in Juniors builds to simplify how the models are built, so there are a fair number of parts in this set which are aimed at large and easy to work with. Including the chassis for the car and many of the wall elements. Of note this set features unique printed elements, a tile with an image of the Parr family out of costume, a wall element with some printed tech details for sound systems and super hero alerts. And the sloped element with the Incredibles logo acting as the hotline phone. A fairly nice selection of parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Brick: This brainwashed minion of Screenslaver has attacked the Parr children at their home. Her Minifigure has a very solid design and nice detailing and as this is a Juniors set I suppose it can be forgiven that she was not made a Bigfig. (Which I think would have suited her character better.) She has no accessories, instead she gets to drive a car and launches literal bricks at the children, which is a great humorous little nod.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Violet Parr: The dual-molded legs look really impressive in dark red with black and the Incredibles all look impressive as a uniform team of Super Heroes. Violet has some nice facial expressions an interesting accessory element to capture her shield ability and her hair piece is very suitable for her character. She&rsquo;s really fun.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Dash Parr: Using short legs which are triple-molded black on red on black, Dash looks just as good as Violet in the uniform of the Incredibles team. They look great standing next to each other and have good use of parts and colours to capture the look of the characters. For accessories Dash gets a water gun.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Jack-Jack: A printed baby LEGO element Jack-Jack looks fine, sadly he doesn&rsquo;t have the logo printed on his chest. I suppose this would be a hard thing to do on such a tiny element. Overall it&rsquo;s a cute looking figure that fans will adore.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 1: Juniors builds are typically very simple and easy to follow along with. The numbered bags approach to building is often found in larger System sets and here it is used to good effect. There is an adventure in every build for the younger builders to enjoy.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Brick and Violet tangle in the front yard while the car Brick uses is built on the large chassis element.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 2: Dash is given a pool to build and a side-build attachment for the home with a slide that is part of the play feature. This build is fairly simple due to the large pieces used and there isn&rsquo;t a lot to say about it honestly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 3: Jack-Jack appears with this final build which is the main floor of the home. Using large wall elements unique to Juniors sets and is again easy and quick to build. A secondary build included with this portion is a catapult for launching Jack-Jack inside his impenetrable ball of flames (represented by LEGO Rock elements) which is a fun play feature for the set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is a fairly large and engaging playset, it features an escape slide, a catapult to deal with the intruder known as Brick whose attacking the house with a car that can launch bricks at the Parr children in a catapult mounted on the side.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It&rsquo;s a pretty solid model and a much better use of parts for a playset compared to the Elastigirl Rooftop set. That being said it may be a bit too simplistic for some fans and builders who prefer things to be more involved. The play features are relatively simple and non-intrusive to the build, but the use of the larger parts will make older builders feel a bit cheated here. The younger builders Juniors are aimed for will probably have a lot of fun.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;d say this is a must have set for fans of LEGO Disney and it&rsquo;ll be a much needed set for collectors of the brand. For builders wanting Juniors sets to collect and build and for MOC fans who enjoy printed elements and unique parts to test their building mettle these sets and this set in particular are quite well designed. To that end I would strongly recommend it, just be aware that there are many elements which are loose and could be easily lost. The bricks Brick throws as projectiles with her catapult are easily lost.</p>
