"J14T14","2018-02-23T20:27:39.06Z","Expecting Gold, But Got Bronze","<p>This set was made a long with a few other LEGO&reg; Classic style sets to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the LEGO brick. When I hers that we were getting sets to celebrate this occasion, I was excited, until I saw the pictures.</p>

<p>This set comes with some nice pieces such as the Unikitty&nbsp;tail in tan and other pieces on some rarer colors. The only other good thing about this&nbsp;set is the printed 2/4 tile with the 60th&nbsp;anniversary logo on it. I wish that they had integrated this piece better into the set like they did with they 40th anniversary of LEGO technic and the 2/3 printed beam that came with the sets.</p>

<p>As for the builds, they are nothing special. The plane has a spot for a minifigure, but none are included. The remote controlled car looks fine, the rainbow has a large gap down the whole thing,&nbsp;and the unicorn looks to &quot;chubby&quot; for my taste. The rest or the pieces included are not used to build anything and the are left for you to make something.</p>

<p>Overall, this set is not the best and the LEGO group could of handled this milestone much better than they&nbsp;did.</p>

"Minifig290","2018-03-24T13:14:09.03Z","Best Â£5 Set Ever","<p>When this set was first revealed i was a bit skeptical but then when it was listed on LEGO&#39;s website my opinion changed massively. It is one of the best &pound;5 part pack sets ever.</p>

<p>This set contains a instructions manual that has four building instructions but it only uses 50 or so of the 86 parts.</p>

<p><b>Builds</b></p>

<p><strong>Build 1</strong>. The first build in this set is a half rainbow. Unfortunately the kinda main build sucks, it has a horrid build but uses some great parts though.</p>

<p><strong>Build 2</strong>. This build is a much better build than the main. It is a RC car with remote, the car&#39;s wheels can move smoothly and looks recognizable for what it is but it could be done better. The remote is a simple 3 piece&nbsp;build with a lever and stud and 1x2 plate.</p>

<p><strong>Build 3</strong>. Now this build is with out a doubt the best build in the set in my eyes, Its a small light aircraft in red and it looks awesome. Its propellor can spin and has a set of wheels for take off and landing smoothly, and the Red and Blue color scheme is great.</p>

<p><strong>Build 4</strong>. This build comes neck and neck with the last its a small unicorn which has a magical color combo of light and lighter blues with tan and a golden horn, and as a bit of extra detail the eyes are printed and there are two wings for it to fly to into the Clouds.</p>

<p><strong>Build 5</strong>. Now as this set is from the Building Bigger Thinking theme there are thousands of builds that are contained in the builders head and this set has some extra little ideas throughout the booklet like a robot, train, Colorful Beach and monsters etc.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>One of the best things about this set is its wide variety of parts from all colors to types, here are some of the 6&nbsp;most notable parts of the 85 pieces:</p>

<p>1. 2x4 Printed 60th&nbsp;Years tile (only released in 6 sets) (Quantity 1)</p>

<p>2. Golden Horn (Quantity 1, plus extra)</p>

<p>3.1x2 Blue Round Tiles With Star Prints On Them (Quantity&nbsp;2, plus extra)</p>

<p>4. 1x2 Bricks In Tan And Light Blue (Quantity 4 of each color)</p>

<p>5. 1x1 Brick In Transparent Orange (Quantity 2)</p>

<p>6. Wings In White (Quantity 2)</p>

<p>There are tons of other parts in this small &pound;5 set.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Now as the title and review suggests I LOVE THIS SET, So much its worth buying multiples, also its a great set for building competitions&nbsp;like the other 4 sets from the Building Better Thinking theme.</p>

<p>Now for a set that sells for &pound;5, $5 it is a&nbsp;great price per part with 5.9p, 5.9c, and the 86 parts included are a mixture of common and rare pieces in 15 or so colors. If your looking for a little gift for your child or friend for under &pound;5, $6 this is the set that I recommend and I&#39;m sure many others will too</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Great Array Of Elements, Airplane, Unicorn, RC Car &amp; Remote, Price and Value</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>Rainbow Build</p>

<p>&nbsp;Everything is average, but the building experience isn&#39;t really special when it comes to Classic/Creator builds.</p>
