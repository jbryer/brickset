<p>&nbsp; Some of the buildings are pretty simple and fine designed with cool play features. The problem is if you want to made something after building the other things the lefting pieces are big and not the better some like just out of place but the price is to good to not buy it. So I recommend this set for a&nbsp;&nbsp;someone with big or little ideas.</p>

<p>The building experience was there for the robot. The parts are good. The price is worth it for including double the amount of pieces normally in a $10 set. The playability also gets points for the Robot/Go Kart/Parrot compared to Rainbow Fun. Including a Minifigure also boosts points for the value of this set.</p>
