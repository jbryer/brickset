<p>Ocean&#39;s Bottom is one of the 60th anniversary Building Bigger Thinking sets, classified by LEGO as a subtheme of the Classic sets.</p>

<p>It comes in a colourful box with a picture of a pile of bricks and some models on the front (I&#39;m immediately liking the pink/purple octopus chef character) a missing word question &quot;what is at the bottom of the ___ ?&#39; for inspiration (repeated in a variety of languages around the box), and more models and a detailed inventory on the back.</p>

<p>Opening the box we find an instruction booklet, a bright green 6x12 plate, and 7 bags with (as is the way with the classic sets) pieces grouped by colour - (white and light grey; black and dark grey; pinks &amp; purples; greens; blues; oranges and yellows; and reds, browns &amp; tan).</p>

<p>This set has 579 pieces in 39 different colours. (LEGO currently has around 60 different colours in use, so this set has a pretty fair representation of the current colour palette.)</p>

<p>There are a lot of different parts, probably more variety than there has been in the Classic brick boxes in the last few years, more SNOTs, clips and bars, vehicle cockpit/windscreens and minifigures (2 in this set), with a range of hair/hats and accessories.</p>

<p>The booklet has instructions for 4 models (with 2 further models having instructions online, as is the way with these classic sets), as well as pictures and inspiration for other models - with (new for these Building Bigger Thinking sets I think) missing word questions in multiple languages (in the same way as the outer box) inspiring creative thinking.</p>

<p>The instructions are lovely and clear, with a white background and pretty good colour distinction even with the quite subtle variations in the different blues and pink/purples.</p>

<p>The purple Octopus Chef has a lot of character and is very posable.</p>

<p>The orange Rocket Car is fun, and can be driven by one of the minifigures.</p>

<p>The baby Dragon is simple but quite cute.</p>

<p>The blue/grey Spaceship (online instructions) is excellent, and very much in the Classic Space style - this also has space for a minifigure (and there is a space helmet, if the figure wants to use it), and it has 2 flick missiles.</p>

<p>I did not build the Trumpet or the mini Castle, but they both look fun, and the later has some great parts.</p>

<p>It certainly looks like the models for which there are instructions (4 in the booklet + 2 online) can all be built at the same time, with plenty of extra pieces for further creativity and play.</p>

<p>This is a great set, excellent value for money, great part and colour variety and cool models.</p>

"Oregondete81","2018-07-15T22:29:43.413Z","Value/Creativity/Spare Parts","<p><strong>Item:</strong> This is LEGO&#39;s 60th anniversary &quot;Ocean&#39;s Bottom&quot; for their Building Better Thinking Campaign. The set comes with 579 pcs. including parts like wheels, minifigs, castle turrets, and specialty&nbsp;blocks. The pieces&nbsp;come in a variety of colors(Grey, Orange, Yellow, Red, Pink, Purple, etc...)</p>

<p><strong>Pros:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>-Roughly 600 pieces for $25 bucks was a great find compared to other LEGO spare piece sets.</p>

<p>-The box includes an instruction manual for 4 builds and you can access two additional builds online, including the castle pictured on the box which was a real neat little build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The parts included allow for a lot of options by including things like wheels, shuttle cockpits, eyes, and doors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>-There is a large variety of colors in this pack which I think young children would love.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-You can build all 6 sets they provide with the pieces they give you(i.e. you dont have to tear one apart to&nbsp;build the other). I built all six sets and still had probably 200 pieces left to build with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The pieces are listed on the box, so if you need specific ones for a MOC you can verify it is in this pack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The minifigs&nbsp;can be pilots, wizard/witch, knight, scuba diver, and chef. Also comes with a few food items(&nbsp;Carrot, turkey, pie).</p>

<p>-Comes with a 60th&nbsp;anniversary piece you will definitely want to pull out and save.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>-Though I appreciated all the colors, I wish they had a similar box with more muted colors like gray, white, and brown. If you try to build anything outside the provided sets&nbsp;it can look super goofy with all the colors mixed in. Still fun though.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Thoughts:</strong> This was a great buy. I got mine on 30% discount making&nbsp;the price per piece about .03. Cant beat that deal on new LEGO. I highly recommend this set for parents and AFOL&nbsp;looking to create unique MOCs.&nbsp;</p>
