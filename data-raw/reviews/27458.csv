"CoffeeBrickMan","2018-03-31T17:00:41.523Z","More than the average Classic set, with a storage box","<p>Mission to Mars is one of the 60th anniversary Building Better Thinkings sets, classified by LEGO as a subtheme of the Classic sets.</p>

<p>This set comes in a large plastic box with a cardboard sleeve. On the sleeve are a missing word question &#39;how can ___ travel through time?&#39; for inspiration (in several languages), a picture of a pile of bricks, several models, and a detailed inventory.</p>

<p>Inside the box are an instruction booklet, a bright green 16x16 plate, and 8 bags of parts grouped by colour (white and light grey; black and dark grey; blues; greens; red &amp; oranges; pinks &amp; purples; yellows with flame yellowish orange (officially in the orange/brown colour family); and browns &amp; tan (officially in the yellow family)).</p>

<p>This set has 871 pieces in 41 different colours (over 2/3rds of LEGOs current colour palette!).</p>

<p>The variety of parts goes beyond the usual basic bricks, roof tiles and plates of a classic set, including a good variety of clips &amp; bars, SNOTs, hinges, wheels and even a few technic pieces - as well as 3 minifigures with a variety of accessories.</p>

<p>The booklet has instructions for 4 models, with 3 further models having instructions online. There are further pictures and missing word questions to provide additional inspiration.The instructions are very clear on a white background with the usual step by step with picture part lists.</p>

<p>Pink &#39;Nessie&#39; is simple and cute.</p>

<p>The purple duck is fun, with additional images of him playing the drums (online instructions, see below), on roller skates or wearing a tutu?</p>

<p>The drum kit is nicely done, and the duck can play them with a couple of clips to hold mini bars.</p>

<p>The pirate ship is a very cool build, and can take a minifigure to pilot it.</p>

<p>I did not build the other models, but the space shuttle model in particular looks like a great build with some nice techniques and parts.</p>

<p>It looks like all the models for which there are instructions (in the booklet and online) can be built at the same time.</p>

<p>The plastic tub itself makes an excellent storage box - it easily hold the parts for this set, 10404 (Ocean&#39;s Bottom) and 10704 (Creative box from 2017) - around 2350 total parts with plenty of space left for more.</p>

<p>This is an excellent set, and good value for money, (a little more per piece than 10404 (Ocean&#39;s Bottom) - but including the plastic box which is good for storage.) The models are fun, with excellent play value, and plenty of addition parts and inspiration.</p>

With this&nbsp;many parts, you can build anything. It also includes instructions to help you build some of the things you see on the cover. It also has links to a website where there are instructions to build other things if you want to.&nbsp;It includes some classic minifigures as well. This set is packaged in a big red brick which is nice for storing the set in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I recommend this set for anyone who is interested in building things, or Lego in general!</p>
