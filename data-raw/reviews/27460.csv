<h2><strong>In the Box</strong>:</h2>

<p>Inside the box are a number of bags that are not numbered. This build doesn&#39;t have quite enough pieces to warrant having numbered bags as some of the larger sets. The 3&nbsp;instruction booklets&nbsp;come in a separate&nbsp;bag to help them avoid damage in the box. This set includes 2 minifigures, a male and female. The female has 2 alternate faces, one with sunglasses&nbsp;and one without. The male is fairly simple but with a great torso design he fits the surfer theme well.</p>

<h2><strong>The Build:</strong></h2>

<p><strong>Surfer Van:</strong></p>

<p>No surprises during the build phase, just a thoroughly enjoyable build. The interior of the van is quite detailed including a small oven/microwave and a sink. The fold away bed with under bed storage&nbsp;at the rear of the van is a nice touch and lends to the mobile home aesthetic of the van. The drivers area of the van is simple and has space for the 2 minifigs. The inclusion of a few hinged 2x1 pieces allows the side of the van to open right up to allow for a better post build play experience, allowing you to get right inside the van from the outside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The roof of the vehicle sits nicely on top of the van and connects via 2 studs, as well as a few parts which slot together without connecting. Roof top storage is also a great addition that holds the two deck chairs and table, a BBQ, space for the surfboard, and the umbrella.</p>

<p>This build is definitely the standout among the three different build options in this set as it uses the majority of the pieces and allows for the most amount of playable options post build.</p>

<p><strong>Surf Lifesaver hut:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The second build of this set is for a surf lifesaver hut on a beach scene with a small beach buggy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What you see is what you get in this build. Again, not many surprises in this build but nonetheless its a fun build. The hut makes great use of the windscreen piece to make the large window across the front of the hut. The ramp is a simple makeup of a 2x6, 3 2x1 sloped bricks and a 1x2 plate&nbsp;w/holder. It is a simple ramp but very effective in showing what its meant to be. This is the case with the majority of this set, with small amounts of pieces being used in clever ways to showcase a minifig scale hut. The beach scene has a nicely build recliner chair with an umbrella and a drink/ binocular holder on the side&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Buggy is nicely detailed as well, with the wheels from the van being used backwards to give them a different look than the van. It&#39;s a good size buggy and seats 1 minifig&nbsp;nicely in the centre. I would have like a better cockpit for the minifig&nbsp;with maybe more controls to drive the buggy with, but it still works nicely with the pieces they have available in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Beach Cruiser:</strong></p>

<p>The third build in this creator set is a Beach Cruiser, or convertible car. The car is a great size and uses a good number of the pieces in the set. The footprint of the car is roughly the same size as the Surfer Van, and uses a very similar build method for the base of the vehicle, utilizing&nbsp;two&nbsp;1x16 bricks with holes, and two 2x4 bearing element bricks to form the structural parts.</p>

<p>The cockpit of the vehicle is great, with space for two minifigs&nbsp;while&nbsp;also including&nbsp;two 1x1 circular printed plates with gauge design to illustrate the speedometer and odometer, as well as a gearstick and steering wheel.</p>

<p>Space on the top for surfboard storage the fits over the visible engine bay finishes&nbsp;the great seaside look of the vehicle and really makes it fit in well with the overall theme of this creator&nbsp;set.</p>

<h2><strong>Overall:</strong></h2>

<p>Overall a great set, with heaps of options for both the collector and the Lego&nbsp;fan&nbsp;who enjoys playing after the build is complete. It fits well with my current city build and with be well used and played with over the foreseeable future.</p>

"Plastic_Fantastic","2020-09-27T18:12:14.41Z","Surfers Paradise - Using two sets","<p>Love the set as it&#39;s useful for beach scenes. With two of these sets you can build the Surfer van + the Beach Cruiser + the Lifesaver hut. You will have to modify the hut slightly. After building these three&nbsp;you can&#39;t build the Buggy&nbsp;since there are no wheels and wheel arches left at this point.</p>

<p>I added 8 extra 4x4 tan plates to create and extend the beach scene in front of the hut. In the upper part of the hut I changed some colour details using only set parts. For the umbrella stick I added a few white 1x1 blocks. Even with the slight modifications the overall look and feel of the hut stays the same.</p>

<p>All in all a great play set or parts pack for beach scenes! For further expansion add Minifigure Accessory Pack <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/850449-1/Minifigure-Accessory-Pack"">850449</a> and you&#39;ve got a Surfers beach party going.</p>
