"CoffeeBrickMan","2018-01-16T13:12:07.627Z","Here Be More Dragons","<p>I like my Dragons, <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/48694"">31032 Red Creatures</a> was one of the earliest sets I bought and reviewed when I got back into LEGO, and I still have a slightly&nbsp;modified version built on my shelf. This set is an obvious successor and has almost the same number of pieces.</p>

<p>The Dragon build&nbsp;in this set looks to have quite a bit in common with that one. The core structure (body, head and tail) is quite similar, but the use of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6157554/plate-1x1-round-w-3-2-shaft"">Plate 1X1 Round W/3.2 Shaft in Black</a> gives the tail more flexibility as those pieces can rotate sideways due to the curved shape. The head is a great build, and different from the many other official LEGO Dragons I&#39;ve built in the last few years. The clawed feet use the dot with hole part in yellow to hold 2 of the claws which looks good. The 2 part wings are mounted on large ball joints giving them great flexibility, with a clip and bar based hinge between the 2 wing parts.</p>

<p>This dragon seems smaller than 31032, but line them up side by side and they&#39;re very close in size. This one has a slight bigger head due to a more complex lower jaw and fire breathing constructions. This ones body is slightly shallower, and the more even sized 4 legs gives it a lower quadruped stance, where as 31032 has larger back legs giving it a more upright stance, like the T-Rex in last years <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/51667"">31058 Mighty Dinosaurs</a>.</p>

<p>This dragon looks really good in New Dark Red with the brighter yellow underbody&nbsp;and Flame Yellowish Orange &#39;cheese wedge&#39; Roof Tiles along its back, and the excellent selection and use of various joints makes this dragon very posable&nbsp;- but I think I still prefer 31032.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;second model, is a Spider with a particularly large and quite heavy abdomen assembly. The 8 legs are not at all repetitive as each pair is different to the others, and each side is mirrored so slightly different construction. Overall it looks quite good but is my least favourite of the 3 models.</p>

<p>The final model is a Troll with an Axe (or maybe guitar!). While he uses the fewest parts of the 3 models, he uses some great techniques to build his face, and he is a most characterful guy. He is quite stable and poses well too - I very much liked him.</p>

<p>Overall&nbsp;a really good set, great models, and an excellent parts selection - all for good price.</p>

"Snail","2018-10-26T14:08:18.497Z","Not overwhelmed by this one ... ","<p>I&#39;m not totally convinced from this set, but it&#39;s not bad (especially if you can score a good price).</p>

<p>The build variety of a dragon, a spider and an ogre are nice, the parts are useful and have useful colours, the building experience is generally good, as with most creator 3 in 1 sets ...</p>

<p>What bugs me the most is that scale of the models are just too big to be micro-cute, and too small to be well detailed for a living creature. This manifests especially in the dragon, and there in his legs that just miss an additional angle to look good or be playable.</p>

<p>The Ogre is just too small and lacks details &ndash; obviously the third choice here ...</p>

<p>What saves it for me is the spider, which is in a nice scale: movability actually works here, and it looks chunky and detailed.</p>

"KarolWes","2019-08-07T17:36:23.923Z","Dragons!","<p>First model in this set is <strong>a Dragon</strong>. This creature looks great. It is very posable. Wings are designed very carefully, which is hard to achieve. Eyes made out of Nexo Knight&#39;s spears are excellent. I like the darker yellow color used to make his spine. It contrasts perfectly with dark red body. Tail looks good, is really simple. Back legs are done pretty well using 1x3x3 arch pieces. Dragon has many claws which are quite good, inclusion of fire piece is a nice addition. Model is strong enough to be played by younger children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then we have <strong>a Troll</strong>. He is one of the best fantasy creature designed in LEGO I&#39;ve ever seen. His head is horribly big, which makes him look funny and a little bit scary. He has a little tail which is great. Making belly out of&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6212206/brick-4-x-6-w-bow-inverted"">4 X 6 W/Bow, Inverted</a>&nbsp;is a perfect designer choice. His limbs are quite posable, mouth can be opened. He&#39;s equipped with a long spear or axe like thing, which has a fantastic look of something makes from junk.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last official build is&nbsp;<strong>a Spider</strong>. He looks ok. It is a standard, typical spider. Nothing really special. His legs are good, backs has a nicely designed sting, head look fine. The color scheme works for him perfectly, especially with yellow stripe on his abdomen.</p>

<p>Finally we get our fourth model, which is semi official. His instruction can be downloaded from LEGO site. It is&nbsp;<strong>a Chinese Dragon</strong>. For me it looks brilliant. I like this oriental vibe. He is long, thin, has greatly designed head. He reminds me of Mushu from Mulan. For a final touch he has a flame on his tail. Overall he is a great iteration of this somehow classical creature.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are many dark red parts, which is a fact worth noticing. Many of them are quite unique, lot of them are very useful, like wings, curved bricks etc. Cheese slopes in dark yellow are fine, though not very useful. There are also many ball joints, claws, studs with hole. Overall great parts.</p>
