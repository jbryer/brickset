Due to the modular system released in 2017, with about 5 sets using it, the set screams at you for wanting to moc it. After trying many different layouts and adding my own parts, the primary still look better.</p>

<p>Even the secondary builds look very good. All the builds are highly playable.</p>

<p>The parts are excellence too! I love all the dark red bricks and mason bricks.</p>

<p>The only down side is that this set is not very popular among brickset-ers. The price per part is just average (many small parts).</p>
