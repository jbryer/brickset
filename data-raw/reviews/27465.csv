<p>Building is easy, but is not very creator-like with rather basic bricks forming something beautiful by building it from bottom to top, instead it&#39;s quite modular, with technic parts connecting the modules.<br />
The final model of the drone does not look like it&#39;s finished at all. The rear feels like something was forgotten, it even has a clip to attach things, but no idea what that could/should be. The propellers are actually &quot;above&quot; the protection frames, as they are too big to be fitted inside. The landing gear is instable and collapses under pressure. And the Windscreen looks like borrowed from City or some other theme, too specialised for Creator.<br />
And then there are the second and third models (a &quot;plane&quot; and some rocket-chair-thing?), that are just plain laughable, not even close to the mediocre-at-best main model.</p>

<p>There are some usable parts in this, like 8 white quarter arches and the orange curved slopes. Also, some technic-parts like pneumatic connectors mis-used in this to attach the arches.</p>

<p>Playability ... i don&#39;t expect much there from Creator, but looking at this i&#39;d want to move those propeller units to simulate steering ... nope, they are fixed in position. What&#39;s left is opening the wind screen, and &quot;moving&quot; the camera. A Minifig!? Nah, who needs that in such a feature-rich and well looking set?</p>

<p>I sincerely hope this is an exception in the usually great creator line or just slipped in from another line as it did not fit anywhere (it&#39;s neither coastguard nor police ...). If this is the direction creator is going, i&#39;d stop buying anything that has only a scent of that spirit living in this set.</p>

Helicarrier.&nbsp; It kinda works if you know what you are doing.</p>

Great design of the flying vehicle and a place for a mini figure. Adaptive landing legs. A spacious and glazed interior that is easy to get into. Great fun building such a cheap set, which in addition is very large in the final version. A great set.</p>
