The primary build on this set has&nbsp;a high degree of playability, I especially like how the secondary and tertiary builds flow...drive to the woods, then do some adventures, and finally camp. I am considering get another one or two to be able to use all the listed configurations together.</p>

<p>The buildable dog is a great example of what to do with a couple small pieces. This is a set I enjoy dis/re assembling from primary to secondary to tertiary build.</p>

<p>The pieces in the set are good, some are a bit specialized, but easily mesh with other parts.</p>

<p>Although&nbsp; I mostly diorama/model Lego stuff, I consider this a highly playable set. It practically begs to be tinkered with and to use the dog for fun stuff.</p>

<p>Overall, a great value, I think a good purchase for AFOL and children alike.</p>

<p>This set includes an off-roading &nbsp;vehicle, a cute dog, a simple minifig, a log, and a stump.</p>

<p>The vehicle features working winch,&nbsp;clips for shovel and pickaxe, headlights, gas and oil cans in the back,seats and steering wheel, and a very nicely built&nbsp;rollcage.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>The winch action works smoothly and the main build is both playable and displayable.</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>The 2 other builds don&#39;t look very interesting.</p>
