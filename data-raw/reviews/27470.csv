Is it worth picking up? I honestly am not the target audience, but I do find Jurassic World a franchise worth purchasing and even a Duplo set can be interesting and fun for an AFOL, but KFOLs probably don&rsquo;t care about that. They want to have fun playing with their set, and you can&rsquo;t ignore that this set is loads of fun.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This Duplo box is pretty exciting for the younger fans of the line. It shows off the T-Rex and Owen and the model built out of the parts in a nice animated version of Isla Nublar. It works well for an attractive packaging design, with loads of alt model design ideas included for you and your little one to discover together.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Many fun parts to be had here, aside from Duplo bricks there&rsquo;s a couple of nice tower posts, a car, a gas can, a telephone, a ladder and a traffic control tower. This is actually a pretty nice looking set, if you&rsquo;re a collector of DUPLO parts to make interior foundations.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Owen Grady: This Duplo Figure looks great, he&rsquo;s a single sculpt with moveable arms and legs and can hold the phone and the gas can. Very colorful and dressed in his outfit from Jurassic World.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">T-Rex: This T-Rex is a single sculpted piece too, similar to the baby dinosaurs, but has an opening and closing mouth. Bricks and other items can fit inside so he can stomp and chomp while threatening to tear down the Tower. Very friendly looking and fun, though not accurately colored to the version seen in the film.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with the previous model this build is one that you need to discover on your own. It has an alternate model inspiration, build alongside your child to show them the official model, and let them put the parts together on their own to build something creative and fun. Not like LEGO System builds.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a pretty nifty looking tower, it&rsquo;s very impressive and looks inspiring. I&rsquo;m pleased to see there&rsquo;s a lot for young builders to do with this set. It&rsquo;s also a very nice set to display, if you wanted to you could even create a massive combined model with this and the Petting Zoo. The car is very fun too and rolls very well. The ladder is used to help Owen climb up to the top of the tower as there are no stairs built with this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Duplo Jurassic World is really impressive, it may not appeal to all AFOLs as collector pieces, but for this AFOL I enjoy exploring all aspects of Jurassic World in buildable form. There is a lot of fun with this set and while I would recommend it I definitely think this set is priced a bit high due to the Jurassic World license. Duplo pricing surprised me and I got both sets on sale, I would suggest picking these up on sale for your little ones to explore the fun and wonder of Jurassic World. Recommended.</p>
