"jzisko","2020-06-13T08:45:35.673Z","Small Set, Small Adventure Included","<p>This was the first Jurassic World set to the collection. &nbsp;It comes with 2 JW minifigs, a raptor, and a vehicle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The raptor, the best part of this set, is a pretty well constructed item. &nbsp;Its mouth has a open or closed position that snaps to those positions. &nbsp;You can adjust the mouth to be in the middle, but takes some steady adjustment and a slight bump will most likely move the mouth to one of the most stable positions listed above. The arms and legs both freely pivot without any stops or adjustments, and the head swivels 360 degrees.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vehicle, being a juniors set, is a pretty easy build, and my 4 year old sailed through it pretty quickly. &nbsp;It is not a sophisticated build but does have a gate on the back that moves to allow your raptor in and out of the back. Overall, a pretty easy build and quick construction. &nbsp;However, that doesn&#39;t detract from the fun it is to build. &nbsp;My son has a couple other juniors sets (<a href=""/sets/60212-1/Barbecue-Burn-Out"">60212:&nbsp;Barbecue Burn Out</a>, <a href=""/sets/60220-1/Garbage-Truck"">60220:&nbsp;Garbage Truck</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""/sets/76133-1/Spider-Man-Car-Chase"">76133:&nbsp;Spider-Man Car Chase</a>), and this one is better and a more fun build that those. &nbsp;Maybe because Lego concentrated on one build with the bricks than spreading out over a couple items. &nbsp;The piece count is higher than those sets too. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The downside of this set is its simplicity, and how quickly the build takes, even at&nbsp;the appropriate age group. &nbsp;The value per piece is slightly high too. &nbsp;29.4 cents per piece is on the higher side, but that&#39;s most likely driven by the large vehicle base and the (pretty cool) raptor that comes in the&nbsp;set. &nbsp;So this is a little on the expensive side. &nbsp;Comparatively, the garbage truck, which has a similar piece count (and has two large plastic pieces) is about 22 cent per piece at&nbsp;90 pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plus side: the raptor. &nbsp;Upon retirement of this set, willing to bet the raptor will go for the $20 that this set costs, so if you&#39;re looking to add dinos, this little guy it worth picking up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a JW set for the little ones, this is a good buy. &nbsp;If you&#39;re looking for a juniors set for your youngster, and money is an issue, then there are other sets of better value. &nbsp;If you&#39;re looking to add to your dino collection, this is probably worth it while still actively sold.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I have a mixed recommendation. It depends on what you&#39;re&nbsp;looking for. &nbsp;Being a juniors set, don&#39;t expect fireworks, but expected more from this one than others in the junior lineup.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the age group: recommended</p>

<p>For the dino: recommended</p>

<p>Overall as a set when compared to other Lego: Not recommended.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-07-31T17:01:15.023Z","Weakest Offering of Sub-Theme.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #10757 Raptor Rescue Truck:</b> Welcome back to Juniors Jurassic World. This set, in my opinion, is far too expensive for what it is. While true it has two large pieces, the truck chassis and the Raptor itself, the rest of the parts count does not justify the 29.99$ CND MSRP. Which is why it took me a while to pick this up when on sale.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The packaging for Juniors won&rsquo;t be around much longer, once all the remaining stock is sold these red packages with Juniors logos will be gone. Replaced by the 4+ sets in regular Themes. Those sets however include similar design elements, though I&rsquo;m not certain if the Easy to Build Logo is still featured prominently on the newer sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manuals are fairly easy to follow along with, even moreso than regular LEGO instruction manuals because they are designed for simple builds for younger builders.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As this is a Juniors set there are precious few parts to discuss. A small number of bricks, a large truck chassis, some printed tiles with the Jurassic World logo on them and that is pretty much it. Considering the price of this set, that is a bit unfortunate.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">InGen Guard: This Minifigure is unique to this set, but the parts and the print have all been seen before across multiple Jurassic World sets. The ball cap is in several other sets, the torso is seen in sets from 2015 and I believe all three of the Juniors sets and the head is in sets from 2015 and 2018. His accessory is a tranquiliser gun with lime green syringe, a staple of Jurassic World&rsquo;s Theme.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Owen Grady: This Minifigure is available in 7 sets, all of his printing is found in many of the sets from Jurassic World. The parts are all the same, he also doesn&rsquo;t come with any unique accessories. As for the purposes of this set, he can hold the Turkey leg on a pole accessory used to lure the Velociraptor into the transport cage.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Velociraptor: Using a green colour scheme, this dinosaur stands out a bit as being unique, but not really worth the asking price of the set as a whole. If you&rsquo;re interested in getting this version of the Raptor I&rsquo;d suggest using Bricklink.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: A small capture cage is built with the parts in this bag. Along with Own and the Raptor, this is a relatively simple build with few instances of difficulty. Nothing really hard to do at all, in keeping with the Juniors level of build designs.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: The truck build is even faster to handle, with the large chassis element used there is little in the way of the build to concern yourself with. It&rsquo;s all very simple and straight forward.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Raptor Rescue Truck: This model is simple, unintuitive and decent enough for what it is. You get a fast to build vehicle to play with in several dozen easy steps, and the level of detail is in keeping with the simplified model. You can fit one driver and the dinosaur in the back, no space for the second Minifig, but it works well as a quick toy to play with. The open air nature of the cab is a bit unfortunate, but a necessary evil for quick easy access of the model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As I noted above this set is not worth 30$ CND. While it does have a nice selection of items to build and play with, it&rsquo;s value is circumspect. Had it included two dinosaurs, perhaps a baby in the same colours as the larger Raptor model it might be worth more. Especially if there was additional elements to build a small piece of scenery with. This is why, despite being a huge fan of the overall Theme, I&rsquo;d strongly suggest skipping this set from Jurassic World Juniors. Not recommended.</p>
