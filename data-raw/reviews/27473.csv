Great Set.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #10758 T.rex Breakout:</b> The largest and most expensive set from LEGO Juniors Jurassic World, this set includes another T-Rex and some impressive bits of printed elements for fans looking to get some elements for their MOC creations. It&rsquo;s still a bit of a hefty price tag, but it&rsquo;s also pretty decent. Definitely think it&rsquo;s a good set compared to smaller ones.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This packaging is Juniors through and through, you get to see a great shot of the set on the front showing a cute little scene. The back includes a shot of all of the different elements of the set and a continuation of the scene from the front on the bottom. Easy To Build is featured as well showing the truck build with the various parts removed from the chassis.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The instructions are quite well designed, as with most LEGO instructions, the Juniors sets include nice little comics telling a story around the set in the back of them. It&rsquo;s something LEGO used to include with Marvel and DC Super Heroes. Now they&rsquo;ve stopped this practice, which is somewhat unfortunate, but it&rsquo;s nice to see it still alive with Juniors.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Being a Juniors set the standard elements are found here, a large baseplate, vehicle chassis, a nicely printed large single gate piece with hinge for doors, printed elements include a 1x4 tile with headlights, 2x4 tile with Jurassic World, 2 1x4 wall pieces with logos printed on the side and a printed ramp element. There is also, unique to this set, a clear window/screen element which has the Island setting of Jurassic World printed on it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Claire Dearing: This version of Claire is found in four sets across 2018 and 2019, the print and design is identical to the Minifigure found in the Carnotaurus set, the Indoraptor set and the new Baryonyx set. This represents the cheapest method of acquiring this Minifigure though, so if you haven&rsquo;t gotten any of the more expensive sets, this is your chance to own a fairly impressive looking version of Claire.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Guard: This Minifigure is identical to the Guard from the Pteranodon set in the Juniors line. Every element is the same here except for the head, which uses a scared yelling or open mouthed expression print, perhaps this Minifigure is meant to be the same character, just with a different expression. He includes the typical tranquilizer gun element for his accessory.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Scientist: Unique to this set and using elements that are fairly common as far as legs and torsos go, this Minifigure looks pretty good. He doesn&rsquo;t have a specific accessory to him, but he is given a brown plant element as if he is meant to be studying them.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Tyrannosaurus Rex: This is the same printed design found in the first 2015 T-Rex, so this Dinosaur isn&rsquo;t unique to the set, but it is a nice addition to your stable of Jurassic World LEGO dinosaurs.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Baby &lsquo;T-Rex&rsquo;: The Raptor Infant animal piece really does not look like a T-Rex, no matter how they paint him up in the same colour scheme to make it seem so, but it is a nifty look for the creature and adds to the fun playability of this Juniors set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">With all the large elements in this set the build is relatively quick and simple. That means naturally that there isn&rsquo;t a whole lot to discuss here. Except of course for the breakdown.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Claire and the Rex are built here alongside the truck.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: The Guard and his large Gate are included here. This build is naturally simple and easy. I noticed again here that the Clutch Power of elements seems weaker than I recall. Some of the parts pop up fairly easier than they should, especially the gate element.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: The scientist joins the group and here you add a small fence section to the gate and a small nesting area for the baby &lsquo;T-Rex&rsquo; to be studied by the Scientist.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This entire set is a nice little play set. The gate and fence are a bit impractical for scale with the Rex, but the Instructions showed a fun little comic adventure that you can see what storyline they were going for this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The model is great for play, an interesting element for display, but there isn&rsquo;t much more to discuss. Aside from the fact that the printed elements really add to the fun of the set and the detailing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a much better set than the Raptor Rescue Truck and I actually recommend getting it. The Minifigures, the dinosaurs, even the models are a vast improvement over the middle priced set of the truck. And there&rsquo;s more to do and play with here compared to a set that is 30$ CND. I would still suggest getting it on sale though because that&rsquo;s always a greater value. Recommended.</p>
