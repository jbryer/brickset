This set only has 191 pieces so the price-per-piece-ratio isn&#39;t really that amazing (I had to pay 28 euros for this set because it was a ToysRus exclusive here in Finland; luckily it&#39;s only about 20 euros/dollars in most other countries.) Is the set still worth getting? Let&#39;s find out.</p>

<p>The set includes three great minifigures, but only one of them is exclusive. First we have Nexo Knight Aaron Fox in his new, golden 2018 armor. The new armor piece looks great, as well as his new torso and leg prints. I wish they would have recoloured the visor piece though, because in trans-neon-orange it now looks kind of out of place... Aaron is equipped with his normal crossbow and a Nexo shield in gold, including a new collectable printed Merlok Power. Aaron also appears in a more expensive set, Aaron&#39;s X-Bow.</p>

<p>Then we have two Tech Vampire villains, Pola and Fred. They both have the standard Virus Vampire torso and leg prints (they look awesome though.) Pola has a really cool exclusive double-sided face print and uses the Lego Batman Movie Joker hairpiece recoloured in purple. Fred is much more generic, using the standard Virus Vampire face and helmet that appear in every single set of the wave. Both vampires use a new titanium metallic armor piece that looks really cool. They are equipped with small daggers using a new trans-green piece in the handle. A new titanium metallic Nexo Shield piece is also included, holding a green Nexo Power.</p>

<p>The build of the vehicle is pretty simple but gets kind of repetitive since the Twinfector actually consists of two nearly identical, smaller bikes. That&#39;s a part of the main play feature of the set: You can detach the bikes from each other and if you want, make them into two hover bikes by turning the wheels. That works well and I think it&#39;s a cool feature kids will like. My only complaint would be the two bikes being really unstable when not in the hoverbike mode. There&#39;s also stud shooters in the sides of the vehicle, shooting out new Tech Critter pieces.</p>

<p>The set works well as a playset but could look better in display: There is some exposed studs and anti-studs, plus two weird-looking Technic pins sticking out from one side of the vehicle, the another one has two pinholes. (They&#39;re there to make it possible to connect the bikes to each other from both sides.) I still think the vehicle looks fine though, they have still actually managed to hide the splitting function pretty well.</p>

<p>This set may only have under 200 pieces, but there&#39;s a lot of cool and rare ones included, most of them being the new minifig accessories I mentioned earlier. There&#39;s also a nice amount of trans-green pieces, including a nice cockpit, six 2x2 tiles and a couple of unprinted Nexo Shields. The huge wheel pieces are also exclusive to this set in that nice titanium metallic colour.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;m really satisfied with this set. Kids will love the play features and for adults there is a lot of new and interesting pieces. And we should not forget the three nicely detailed minifigures. Overall I&#39;ll give this set a 5/5, it&#39;s a great little set.</p>
