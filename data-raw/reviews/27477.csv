<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-07e9106e-7fff-8ebf-5a30-28d585134817"">Many have mixed thoughts on the clash of worlds that is Nexo Knights. I for one like the change of pace. This set has given me some doubts, though.</b></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-07e9106e-7fff-8ebf-5a30-28d585134817"">Minifigures</b></h3>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-07e9106e-7fff-8ebf-5a30-28d585134817"">As the name suggests, this is a set all about Aaron.&nbsp; Not a bad figure if you ask me. He has detailed, multicolored printing on his feet, legs, hips, and torso. It all blends nicely and adds a lot of depth to the figure. Aaron&rsquo;s arms are a lovely Earth Green and his hands a smooth Warm Gold. The striking armor made with this color slides perfectly over his emblem. The double sided head has a huge smile on one side and a more mild expression of enjoyment on the other side. A well crafted helmet fits over this head and offers a crisp contrast to the Trans-Neon Orange knight visor.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-07e9106e-7fff-8ebf-5a30-28d585134817"">Robin Underwood has a much less exciting minifigure. There is no printing on his plain black legs.&nbsp; His torso exhibits robust technological printing on both sides, but is not eye-catching. He shares Aaron&rsquo;s exquisite armor which once again hugs the emblem perfectly. His helmet is not new, but obscures his wonderful double sided head. The front of the head displays a tech headset with a smirk and the back is an unmuted expression of disgust.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-07e9106e-7fff-8ebf-5a30-28d585134817"">Vanbyter NO. 307 is the main antagonist in this set and appears quite intimidating. Every speck of his feet, legs, and hips receives terrific printing. This theme continues about halfway up his torso. A pale, muscular design completes the rest of the body. Nano wires run throughout the flesh as well. His stark, jagged armor and helmet correspond beautifully. The head in between has a strong vampire vibe on the obverse in contrast to his rear, tech arrayed face which I think is very creepy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-07e9106e-7fff-8ebf-5a30-28d585134817"">The last minifigure is best described as an evil squirebot. The aesthetic extends across the assembly. His face feels appropriately angry and features a scuff mark next to both eyes. His alternate expression shows grit and determination, but does not significantly differ from his other expression.</b></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-07e9106e-7fff-8ebf-5a30-28d585134817"">The Completed Model</b></h3>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-07e9106e-7fff-8ebf-5a30-28d585134817"">Aaron&rsquo;s X-bow is designed to resemble a crossbow and seems aptly placed in that role. The tail makes use of the previous wave&rsquo;s sword piece, helping the sleek colossus to take shape. Further up the tail are two clips for the shields in this set and they are integrated flawlessly. At the core of this ship is a stunning feat of engineering. The Technic components here are specifically chosen for the play feature and include a part that has only appeared in one other system set.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-07e9106e-7fff-8ebf-5a30-28d585134817"">The wings provide a repetitious, but seamless build process to formulate such unique rotors. The rotors at the end of these wings are constructed from axe blades that first appeared in the same wave as the aforementioned sword blade. These rotors must be manually driven. They are also individually powered. This is unfortunate, but a massive redesign was probably the only way another feature could have been added.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-07e9106e-7fff-8ebf-5a30-28d585134817"">The cockpit is heavily armored and effectively uses multiple colors alongside each other. The SNOT technique finds a suitable home here to achieve this structure. A piece normally used for car doors gets a higher calling as a missile door. These flick-fire missiles are hidden splendidly and work every time. Aaron certainly feels protected next to these missiles. He has more than enough room in the cockpit. The windscreen even has an easter egg in the form of a sticker with letters to indicate the theme song used for the Nexo Knights TV Series.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-07e9106e-7fff-8ebf-5a30-28d585134817"">The main feature of this set involves deploying Robin in his motorbike from underneath the aircraft. The launch process is superb. The motorbike is sturdy. It looks proper from most angles. I despise the yellow Technic parts and gaps on either side when playing with just the motorbike. However, these errors are not seen when in conjunction with the main craft. The slope pieces also clash with each other. Thankfully,this does not detract from the entirety of the set.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-07e9106e-7fff-8ebf-5a30-28d585134817"">A symmetrical glider is included and does not have any worthwhile elements, but I am happy that the antagonists have a vehicle to use in aerial combat.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-07e9106e-7fff-8ebf-5a30-28d585134817"">Overall</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-07e9106e-7fff-8ebf-5a30-28d585134817"">I acquired this set last minute from a closing Toys R Us. Although I didn&rsquo;t think much of it at the time, I am glad I bought it. Fans of Nexo Knights will likely want to get this set if they have not already done so. As for others, I still believe this set is worth purchasing if just for the parts variety alone. Whatever the case, most will find it hard to turn away.</b></p>
