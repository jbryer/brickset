When I first saw a image of this set, I instantly knew I had to get it. The colour scheme of black, dark grey and trans-bright-green is really striking and makes the Bomber look really awesome.</p>

<p>The piece selection of the set is great. You get plenty of black, dark stone grey and medium stone grey plus some highlights of white, trans-bright-green and bright yellowish green (Blacktron fans, attention! :D ). There&#39;s a lot of new and rare parts too: The windshield, the 4X4 slope number 6208787, the armours of the figs, the helmets of the bad guys, the new Critter piece (35039), a new printed eye (6210573), the gunmetal-grey Nexo shield of the baddies, the pearl gold Nexo Shield of Macy and six 2X2 bricks in trans-bright-green.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s move on to the minifigs. You get three figs there: Macy the Nexo Knight, Berserker and a regular baddie henchman called Mechabyter. Macy looks great with his new golden Nexo armour and has some gold details in her torso and legs too. She looks awesome, and my only gripes about her are the same old face print and the trans-neon-orange visor of her helmet (I hope they would&#39;ve used a gold one instead.) Macy is equipped with a large mace and a pearl gold Nexo Shield including one of the new collectable powers, &#39;The Mace of Merlok&#39;. Macy is exclusive to this set.</p>

<p>Berserker is an another exclusive minifig. He seems to be blind and wears his gunmetal-grey helmet the wrong way round. He has double-sided face and looks great with the new armour and the helmet with two, trans-bright-green spikes (rare!). Berserker is equipped with a sword and the baddie Nexo Shield, including an old Nexo Power from last year.</p>

<p>At the last and the least, we have a soldier called Mechabyter. He appears in three other sets too, with a couple of different names (Fred and Megabyter.) While he is the most common fig of the set, he still looks splendid. The black, green and gunmetal-grey colouring of his torso and legs look great and make him a valuable minifig to any Space/Scifi fan. He also has a double-sided face, one side being similiar mask like Berserker&#39;s and another a spooky, red-eyed vampire face. His weapon is a simple gunmetal-grey spear.</p>

<p>The build of the set is fun and has some interesting techniques, it took me about 30 minutes to finish. First you build a small jetpack for Macy. It&#39;s a nice side-build and extremely poseable for its size. Then, into the Berserker Bomber itself. Like I mentioned earlier, the colour scheme looks great. The plane has some nice details, like the printed eyeball on the top (does Berserker see everything via it? Creepy :0). There&#39;s some clever action features too:</p>

<p>- You can pose the wings both horizontally and vertically and reveal two six-stud shooters that can be activated by rotating the radar dishs under the trans-green, round pieces.</p>

<p>- You can detach a battle suit mech from the rear of the plane (It&#39;s connected with small click joints.) The mecha looks cool and has a stickered control panel. It also has a critter-stud-shooters in its hands (you get one spare critter to shoot too!)</p>

<p>- You can store the weapons of the baddies under the cockpit section.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a really fun set. The last wave of NK has probably been its best ever, and with the virus vampire villains, I&#39;m now kinda sad it doesn&#39;t get a summer wave. It would&#39;ve been nice to get a human Monstrux minifig and a proper HQ for the villains. But hey, get this set if you can! I strongly recommend it. Kids will enjoy the play value and adults the great figs and pieces.</p>
