<h3>&nbsp;Box and Instructions&nbsp;</h3>

<p>the box is standard BrickHeadz&nbsp;fare, but I think&nbsp;the Star Wars: The Last Jedi box style really suits the BrickHeadz&nbsp;line. The white and red styling is very nice and crisp looking, and the figure contrasts very well with the box. all in all, the box is actually very cool. The instructions were bent ):</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>BrickHeadz are famed for their parts. With each set you get 14 1x2x2/3 bricks with four studs on the side! 14! There are also three printed BrickHeadz eyes, two 1x4 bricks with robe print, and lots of 1x1 quarter circles in reddish brown.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>BrickHeadz&nbsp;come together very quickly, and Rey is no exception to this. The BrickHeadz are essentially a SNOT core covered in plates and tiles.</p>

<h3>Completed Model</h3>

<p>The model comes with a 6x6 base. The series two plate is included. LEGO recently stopped putting printed tiles on their BrickHeadz, but I think that the sets should have the logo of the theme they come from on the bases. For example, the Star Wars or Ninjago logos. Rey herself is a decent BrickHeadz- when viewed from the side. From the front, she looks almost bald. All of the hair is on the back. Other than this, the figure is good. She is armed with a lightsaber.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-11-07T12:38:34.52Z","The Skywalker Arisen","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #41602 Rey:</b> We find more LEGO Star Wars BrickHeadz in Series 2, the first batch consisted of The Force Awakens with Finn and Phasma, other Star Wars BrickHeadz from Series 1 were relegated to SDCC exclusives based on Boba Fett and Han in Carbonite. So with Series 2 we come to The Last Jedi, originally Rey and her case mate Kylo Ren were released in a single package as an exclusive to Target stores in the US. LEGO then released them individually for collectors elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: The Last Jedi BrickHeadz boxes are pretty bland, being primarily white with a red top the packaging design is fairly uninteresting. However the image showing Rey as she appears in the film on the side of the box really enhances the overall design, you get a smaller shot of Rey from the film in a dynamic pose then you have this artistic imagery of a silhouette of her head, the Rebel symbol and some technical detailing/wireframe blueprints of the Millennium Falcon. This is a much better idea than what we saw with Series 1 BrickHeadz which featured simple character shots on the side of the box.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: And again we have a really simple manual design with the problem of being folded in half. Naturally this is necessitated because of the size of the BrickHeadz boxes, but it does make the overall manual design somewhat irritating when building and the booklet keeps slamming shut on you.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Printed tiles for Rey&rsquo;s costume are included in this brilliant little parts pack, you also get a Lightsaber hilt and blade. Bricks, plates, tiles, everything about a BrickHeadz set makes it stand out as some of the best non Classic sets made by LEGO to include parts for MOC fans. Which is probably why they are so hard to find due to the price-per-piece ratio and the quickly retired aspect of these sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Building Rey is just as engaging and interesting as any other BrickHeadz. I enjoy the different techniques used whenever you make the Head portion of these models, as each one has differences to make the unique characteristics, the hair and so forth and so on. There is a bit of repetition in the steps, but overall it&rsquo;s a highly satisfying build, and perfect for How Fast Can You build this challenges.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Rey from The Last Jedi makes for a pretty good choice as a BrickHead, her design stands out more than Jakku Rey would have and the colouring is much nicer. Because of the simple connection for her hands you can also alter how she holds her Lightsaber, the official build has her holding it down at her side, but the connection of the arm/hand plate allows you to have her holding it up if you&rsquo;d like.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I recommend collecting BrickHeadz if you really like fun and simple models with unique techniques for making realistic brick built facsimiles of your favorite characters. These sets are not going to be for everyone, so if they don&rsquo;t appeal to you I wouldn&rsquo;t suggest picking them up. They don&rsquo;t really do anything, there is no play features, there are no Minifigures and you are basically building a small model to put up on a shelf and that&rsquo;s pretty much all. I still recommend them if that&rsquo;s what you enjoy about LEGO as they are perfectly priced for a great collectible like this, much better than the Funko Pops I compared them to in my first review with Black Widow. So&hellip; Highly Recommended.</p>
