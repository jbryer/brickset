So while the two-pack makes sense, splitting it up here with these two because it isn&rsquo;t a Target exclusive is a bit daft in certain respects, but I guess if you&rsquo;re interested in collecting every sealed BrickHeadz set and keep them sealed you&rsquo;ll be buying these two sets twice, in their combo package and in their single boxed releases.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: As with Rey&rsquo;s box Kylo has the white background and on the side shows off Kylo in a nice action pose with his helmeted silhouette and the symbol of the First Order/Empire on the side in red. This, again, is highly impressive and I like the decision to make the artwork on the sides of the box more dynamic and engaging when looking at the package on store shelves.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: Here we go again, the manual is the same design as every other BrickHeadz, nothing really to discuss. You can follow the steps as long as you iron the thing out or reverse the crease and then stick something over the thing to keep it open. If they had reduced the size of this manual to better accommodate the box it would have worked out better.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kylo has some nice printed tiles for his torso and his scarred face, and the rest is the same as what I&rsquo;ve said for all of these BrickHeadz sets. You&rsquo;re going to enjoy collecting them as parts packs if you&rsquo;re a big MOC fan, especially as the new 1x2 bricks with side studs are commonly found in large numbers in these sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kylo&rsquo;s build is really satisfying, while you build him you&rsquo;ll really enjoy each step as you&rsquo;re making his torso, his cape, his hair. Honestly the hair builds on these un-helmeted characters are often extremely impressive to make signature hairstyles out of bricks and plates without compromising the models. And the SNOT build technique is always very enjoyable as well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kylo is a bit different from Rey, unlike with her model you can&rsquo;t alter the official placement of his hand so he can hold the Lightsaber in a battle ready pose rather than at his side, this is because his hair is built up on the side of his head and blocks the blade, if you wanted to change his hand&rsquo;s position you&rsquo;d have to remove the Lightsaber blade in order for him to hold a deactivated Lightsaber up and ready to attack, which is odd looking.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The rest of the model works great though and he looks very menacing for a little blocky cute version of Kylo Ren. The printed tiles really help out in making him look correct despite being built out of bricks.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Again I strongly recommend these sets to fans of building models and putting them on display. They do not lend themselves well to playing stories out with them, but are fun little collectibles to put on top of a shelf or dresser and enjoying seeing all these models standing next to one another. If you don&rsquo;t collect to display and rather prefer to play with your LEGOs as I&rsquo;m sure most Kids, Teens and Adults who still enjoy playing with toys do, then these just aren&rsquo;t for you. Strongly Recommended.</p>
