<p>Comes in a small box and small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You don&#39;t get any cool or unique parts in this set. You get 4 printed pieces in this set which are a 1x2x2 brick with printing of a black collar shirt, eyes x2, and a 1x1 brick with printing towards the top of brick. The total piece count is 141.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me less than 10 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a really nice brickheadz. The design and detail of the hair and belt are really good and resemble the actually character really well. He comes with a brick built blaster (made out of 4 pieces) which is okay and could have been better. He comes with a bigger stand the original brickheadz (which I like). The use of parts on the hair is great and does a good job of highlighting the young Han Solo&#39;s hair. The detail on the belt is great with the holster for his blaster and the belt buckle.&nbsp;I recommend this brickheadz to any brickheadz collector or Star Wars fan. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

That isn&rsquo;t entirely a bad thing, but for collectors of these Star Wars BrickHeadz it may be disappointing to see Solo Han before OT Han.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This box has the Solo design on it, meaning the orange sky is in the background, which I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s from Kessel or Corellia honestly. Han is found on the side with the new actor and the front shows the BrickHeadz on display.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is folded in half, which again makes it ten times more frustrating to keep open while building unless you are in the habit of un-folding the crease in the middle of your folded manuals.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There&rsquo;s a lot of brown in this set, the larger headlight bricks are in abundance of course. Some flesh toned tiles are in this set, which may or may not be useful to MOC folks. Great parts pack as usual.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Building Han is loads of fun, this BrickHead has the same build as all others, but there are some interesting differences. A lot more plates and 1x1 bricks are used for the torso instead of larger bricks, and the hair is a real treat as you get to build it up very nicely. Really looks like Han&rsquo;s hair in Solo, not sure if it matches the OT Han look as well though.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a really great model, Han is based on Solo, as I&rsquo;ve mentioned before and it looks really distinct compared to his OT look. LEGO printed a 1x1 with the bit of detailing seen on Han&rsquo;s brown jacket, which stands out as a rare instance of limited printing for the BrickHeadz of licensed characters. He gets to hold a little pistol which is built with a few pieces, and on top of that you will find a really great hair style build on this character.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with most BrickHeadz, if you aren&rsquo;t a fan of the aesthetic you won&rsquo;t be buying or collecting these things. Fans of the Theme may be disappointed not to have an OT Han to put with Luke and Leia, but eventually we will more than likely see an OT Han that is not a block of Carbonite or exclusive to SDCC. Recommended for fans.</p>
