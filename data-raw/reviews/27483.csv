"randomly_generated","2019-05-13T18:03:23.94Z","I just wish it was the OT Chewie...","<p>Overall, this was a very satisfying build, breaking up the monotony of other BrickHeadz&nbsp;with unusual parts, colors, and building techniques.&nbsp;It looks great (ecspecially the nose!), and fits in well with my army of other BrickHeadz. Clearly,&nbsp;this is not a play set, so has no value as such. All-in-all, this is a great set.</p>

<p>However, my one and only complaint is that this set (along with BickHeadz Han Solo) is&nbsp;based on the movie&nbsp;<em>Solo: A Star Wars Story&nbsp;</em>(which wasn&#39;t that great) as opposed to the Original Trilogy (for which these characters are well known). I feel that this was a mistake&nbsp;as the OT has a much larger fan base, and BrickHeadz based on those renditions would have sold just as well (if not better than) the <em>Solo</em>&nbsp;ones.</p>

<p>I, for one, did not buy the Han Solo BrickHeadz&nbsp;simply because it didn&#39;t look close enough to the OT version. BrickHeadz Chewbacca was less of an issue, mainly because the only major alterations were the bandolier (the new strap is partially covered by his beard, so no biggie) and his blaster not being a bowcaster (easily modified).</p>

<p>So, yeah.</p>

<p>I would recommend this set&nbsp;to any Star Wars or LEGO fan.</p>

<p>Comes in a small box with a small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some nice pieces with this Brickheadz. Getting an array of brown, dark brown, and dark tan parts are some nice pieces to get. You get four printed pieces in this set, which are: two&nbsp;eyes, and two 1x2x2 brick with his strap with ammo (front) and dual strap (back) which look really good. You also get four 3x4x2/3 brown plates that are used to add a rounded look to his head. The total piece count for the set is 149 pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy, nothing to it. It took me around less than 10 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a good brickheadz. The use of all the different bow plates and bricks and roof tile studs add a lot of great detail to Chewbacca. The 1/4 circle tile is a great piece as his nose. The printed pieces are nice as they show his iconic strap/belt that he always has on. He has a brick built blaster made out of 7 pieces which looks nice (I would have preferred his iconic crossbow, but this is the Chewbacca from the Solo movie, so oh well). I recommend this to any Lego Brickheadz or Star Wars fan to add to your Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
