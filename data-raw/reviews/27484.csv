The pieces are varied and useful and the piece count is amazing! Over 700 for $30! So lets get to the details of the set now, They start with you building a blank white figure to show you how to build a brickhead, this process is quite enjoyable and simple to understand with the easy instructions and simple design, So after you do that you get to make your own brickhead! I made myself of course and used the recommended designs to build the hair and head. They give you enough pieces to make 2 but you will still have hundreds of bricks left over for MOCs&nbsp;and anything else you&#39;ll need em for. I hope this review helped you decide whether you want this set or not and I wish to you happy building!</p>

I bought it, and suddenly found myself wondering which Brickheadz&nbsp;I should buy next.</p>

<p>I actually built the default white Brickhead in the car on the way home, I was just finding it that hard to wait. When I got home, I made Brickhead&nbsp;models of myself, my parents, my brothers, and multiple movie characters. It was purely addictive, I couldn&#39;t stop making Brickheadz! The instructions show ways to make about 10 hairstyles and 6 clothes, but I often ended up making my own clothes and heads after I had gotten used to building Brickheadz.</p>

<p>There were more than enough pieces to make any combination, except for a strange lack of yellow bricks, which made me unable to give my brother yellow clothes. The various accessories were mre than enough to suit most everyday characters, and I quite liked the new glasses pieces. I do wish that there grey&nbsp;pieces to make an older person&#39;s hair.</p>

<p>The set includes a sticker-sheet&nbsp;with a lot of little symbols, logos, ties, etc. Originally I was confused by this, as LEGO stickers are typically one-use, so taking them off again would be a waste. I clearly wasn&#39;t thinking straight, as if you don&#39;t want to see the sticker, you can just turn the brick around.</p>

<p>Brickheadz&nbsp;are obviously not designed to be playable, but building, rebuilding, and remaking my own Brickheadz was far better than any trapdoors or missiles to fiddle with. The price was possibly a little expensive peice-for-piece, but it terms of the fun and time consumed by it, it was worth it 10 times over.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a brilliant set that I have not regretted buying once. It was very fun to build, and I strongly suggest that you buy it whether you are into Brickheadz&nbsp;or not.</p>

The 4.2&nbsp;cent price-per-piece seemed like a great deal, so I decide to try it out. That ended up being one of the best LEGO buys I have made.</p>

<p>This set comes with a bunch&nbsp;of rarer parts, such as the 1x1 rounded corner tile in several colors, and the new brickheadz&nbsp;glasses pieces. There is even a sticker sheet included that you can use to add a little flare to your model.</p>

<p>You can also make two brickheadz with nearly infinite&nbsp;amounts of customization&nbsp;with the parts included. You can make anyone into a brickhead&nbsp;with the parts included. I built the base model as well as a brickhead&nbsp;of myself. It looked pretty good and I proudly displayed it for a while.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great set to get even if you do not like the brickheadz&nbsp;style. The number of pieces you get for the price is a rare treat from LEGO and it should not be passed up. This set is fun for children and adults alike and it has to be one of the best sets of 2018!</p>

<p>To start off, the value is amazing at $30 for 708 pieces. Not to mention the fact that these pieces are way more useful than those included in &quot;Classic&quot; sets. The building experience was awesome as I built myself and another one of my family members. The instructions to build customs were easy to follow. The parts are amazing as it allows you to show off your personality and the stickers are also useful even if it&#39;s not for this set.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The playability is awesome as there&#39;s lots to do with this set. You don&#39;t even have to build yourself, you could build characters not in &quot;Brickheads&quot; yet also. The accessories can also give you an idea of what to build. Definitely one of the better &quot;Brickheads&quot; sets.</p>

I had way more fun than expected. I am currently looking into buying custom bricks with our job logos on it in order to give us BrickHeadz of me and the wife in our job uniforms.</p>

"JayTheNinja19","2020-11-13T11:01:21.343Z","Go Brick Me: One of the best sets I've ever bought","<p>When I saw this set for the first time, and discovered that the price was a mere $29,99&nbsp;-or, in South Africa, where I live, R650-&nbsp;I was shocked. I was shocked in a good way, because for 708 pieces that&#39;s an incredible price. I wasn&#39;t a massive fan of the BrickHeadz theme then, but I now am, and this set was&nbsp;a must-have. The set allows you to build 2 full BrickHeadz.&nbsp;The pieces provided for hair options are yellow, black, reddish brown, and orange. My single complaint with this set is that I feel that grey&nbsp;and white pieces should&#39;ve been included should you want to make your grandparents, parents,&nbsp;etc. In terms of the body, a variety of colours are provided, but if you want to make two BrickHeadz with the same body colour you&#39;ll find it&nbsp;difficult without dipping into other pieces from your collection. As far as accessories go I feel like a few more could&#39;ve been added. The skin colour pieces are great as they give enough pieces to make 2 full characters of&nbsp;each skin tone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instruction manual&nbsp;is&nbsp;pretty large, and it gives clear guidance on a good range of designs. On top of some suggestions for how to make hair,&nbsp;pieces are provided if you want to make a hat, or cap. You can also make a red skirt, and the inclusion of 2 styles of glasses/spectacles is awesome, especially for me as I&#39;ve worn glasses since I was 6.</p>

<p>Possibly the best part about this set is that it&#39;s a great set for the pieces alone.&nbsp;You can make two BrickHeadz, and then use the 400-500 extra pieces for whatever you want. The value of this is probably the best I&#39;ve ever seen on a LEGO set released after 2015, and I&#39;d say that it makes the list of my 10&nbsp;favourite sets I own. At the end of day, you really can&#39;t go wrong by buying this. An excellent concept, and excellently executed. If I were to rate it, I&#39;d give it 95/100</p>
