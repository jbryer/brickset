This set has a good cost/piece ratio and would be a perfect &quot;hangable&quot;. I do wish that the designer had put a black piece in front of the cockpit window so as to hide the black-to-red transition.</p>

"Breyden_N_LEGO","2019-12-13T19:22:47.973Z","Small, but cute...","<p>Alright, so before I begin, let me just say that right now I have a few reviews planned for this week&nbsp;until Christmas. Also, I want to thank the first (and only) person to find the last review helpful. I&#39;m really looking forward to suggestions on how I can improve my reviews so note that. But with that behind, let&#39;s begin!</p>

<p>Today&#39;s review is on the 2018 set 75194 First Order TIE Fighter which has 92 pieces and&nbsp;one minifigure (First Order TIE Pilot) and is worth $10 in the U.S. This, much like the Millennium Falcon Microfighter, are both instantly recognizable ships with standard TIE Fighters appearing in multiple renditions since 2001&nbsp;so it&#39;s no surprise to see a new rendition of a&nbsp;new TIE Fighter for the Sequel Trilogy.</p>

<h3>Box and instructions&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Much like the other Microfighters this one doesn&#39;t have the heading for merchandise with the texture of The Last Jedi. Instead the box features explosions and a planet in the background and in the back shows all the other Microfighters of Series 5. Once again, nothing special but it&#39;s what you can probably expect for a $10 sized box. The instructions are simple with about 30 pages and at the back&nbsp;it shows a whole bunch of other sets from the January 2018 LEGO Star Wars wave which have nice backgrounds for a couple of sets that could be added together for extra play.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The First Order TIE Pilot is the only minifigure in this set. He has some nice printing on his torso and legs with whitish highlights to indicate his clothes. His helmet has also a really nice new mold, which I especially like in his cable thingy (don&#39;t know what it is) that can connect to his torso. However his face has the standard face used for the Clone Troopers ever since 2013, which is a letdown. I get they&#39;re common minifigures, but that isn&#39;t an excuse. Still, at least the printing is nice enough, and at least the face can be hidden with the helmet anyway.</p>

<h3>Parts and pieces</h3>

<p>Not much to say here... a lot of the pieces in here were already used on a lot of sets, but there is a new plate piece of transparent red with a cool printing for the TIE Fighter window. Other than that though, no new pieces&nbsp;here.</p>

<h3>The build and playability&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The final build is just a normal TIE Fighter, but it&#39;s worth to mention the missiles which are just standard and don&#39;t shoot very far, which might at least be good so that they don&#39;t get missed, although they feel more like loose pieces. Still, they shoot at a nice distance just as long as you get a good shot.</p>

<h3>Pros and cons</h3>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Cool exclusive TIE pilot minifigure</p>

<p>Nice TIE Fighter for ten bucks</p>

<p>Awesome dome piece for the window</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Specifically, at times, the wings will fall lose</p>

<h3>Overall final verdict</h3>

<p>It&#39;s&nbsp;a nice set that is still affordable for a decent price with a lot of the same things I mentioned on the Millennium Falcon which I&#39;ve already done a review for. This I&#39;d recommend to both Star Wars fans and those who like small sized buildings as this one is no exception. With that being said, this one I&#39;d&nbsp;rate a 8.5/10.</p>
