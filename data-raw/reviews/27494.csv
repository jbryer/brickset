<p>The Ski-Speeder is nice and fairly well done as compared to the larger version. I think it&#39;s cool that these 2-packs add an extra &quot;throw-in&quot; and, for this set, it is some planted-gun on the salt surface.&nbsp;</p>

This set includes the two vehicles in micro fighter form plus a mini build for a small part of the trench which has a stud shooter gun and spot to stand a minifigure.</p>

<p>The minifigres included are the First Order walker driver&nbsp;who has some great printing on his torso, legs and helmet. He is also&nbsp;equipped with a&nbsp;blaster pistol&nbsp;and&nbsp;this is a great inexpensive way to get this minifig&nbsp;. The other minifig included is the resistance speeder&nbsp;pilot who is exclusive to this set and&nbsp;&nbsp;has&nbsp;a great selection of printing on the torso and legs plus&nbsp;hair and&nbsp;headset piece. He is also equipped with a small blaster pistol.</p>

<p>The first order vehicle is the AT-M6&nbsp;walker which has some awesome details with the seat with control panel for the driver on top and canister builds on the back. The set also has some great posability&nbsp;with articulation of the legs and ball joint for the head. It also has two stud shooters on the sides for play.</p>

<p>The vehicle for the resistance is the ski speeder which has a great design with cockpit for the pilot which is actually very accurate to the real design of the speeders. The speeder has a great blue and grey color scheme. The speeder also has the ski part on the bottom of the build which can be moved up and down. Like the walker the speeder also has two stud shooters.</p>

<p>Overall I highly recommend this set as it is great value and great for play to recreate battle scenes from the movie without buying&nbsp;the bigger versions of these vehicles. The only issues i have with the set, are&nbsp;the walker feels a bit small compared to the speeder and it doesn&#39;t really represent the shape of the vehicle from the movie, but nevertheless&nbsp;this set is great&nbsp;for getting multiples of and defiantly is worth getting if you are a fan of the movie or want some cool small vehicles to play around with or put on display.</p>
