This set includes the two vehicles in micro fighter form plus a mini build for a weapons holder and ladder for the A-wing.</p>

<p>The minifigres included are the last Jedi version of Kylo&nbsp;Ren with his iconic light saber and scar down his face, this is a great inexpensive way to get this version of Kylo&nbsp;Ren. The other minifig included is the resistance A-wing pilot with a great selection of printing on the torso,legs, helmet and duel sided face print. she is also equipped with a small blaster pistol.</p>

<p>The first order vehicle is Kylo&nbsp;Ren&#39;s&nbsp;TIE silencer which is a great representation of the ship with a printed control panel with seat for Kylo&nbsp;Ren. The ship also has posable wings with two flick fire missiles on the bottom which are great for play.</p>

<p>The vehicle for the resistance is the&nbsp; A-wing star fighter which has a very good blue and white design and it does a very good job at looking like the ship from the movie. This build also has two flick fire missiles on the side of the wings which is great to battle against the TIE silencer.</p>

<p>Overall I highly recommend this set as is a great price with lots of fun and play to have and if you are a fan of the micro fighters then this set will not disappoint.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-10-01T05:17:31.37Z","Great first Star Wars spaceship set. ","<p>So my son has a handful of Star Wars sets, but so far they had all been terrestrial vehicles (AT-AT and AT-ST) and minifigure sets, these are his first spaceships and microfighters. Plus&nbsp;it comes with two of them, both a rebel ship and a First Order ship, meaning they can fight each other!</p>

<p>for the First Order you get a very cool TIE fighter piloted by Kylo&nbsp;Ren. Just the lightsaber alone made my son happy. Although I think he would have preferred a Kylo&nbsp;Ren helmet, he is way too young to watch the movies so only knows Kylo Ren from books and toys where he is almost always wearing his helmet. The TIE fighter has a very cool design and a brilliant way of attaching the wings so that they can always be at the correct angle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The A Wing is a beautiful design with a great color scheme, although even to a 5 year old it&rsquo;s coolness factor fails in comparison to a TIE fighter (not Lego&rsquo;s fault). It is piloted by a generic rebel who resembles the pilot in the movie very well. However, while she is true to the movie, given that she is fighting Kylo&nbsp;Ren, she doesn&rsquo;t really stand a chance, I think while it would have been inaccurate, Rey or Finn would have made the set just that much more enjoyable. The build for the A Wing is very straight forward and simple enough for a 5 year old. The A Wing also comes with steps and some tool holders, although it is one tool short of being able to fill the holders. Quite honestly, this addition adds nothing to the set and I would have preferred they left it out and made the set $1 cheaper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both ships come with missiles which make it extremely fun to fight with. However, in order to have them fire a decent distance you need to flick them, which is a very difficult skill for a 5 year old. This is the sets only shortcoming, but of course my son has no problem flying the missiles with his hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this is an excellent introduction to Star Wars spaceships and perfect for younger children. The two ships and missiles, along with Kylo Ren minifigure, make it incredibly playable with. I couldn&rsquo;t more highly recommend this set, and I am now incredibly interested in getting my son more of the microfighters&nbsp;sets.&nbsp;</p>
