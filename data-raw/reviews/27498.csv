"ninbricks","2018-04-21T12:16:52.79Z","It looks nice, BUT...","<p>At first I was impressed by this battle pack, that is, like good old JANG mentioned it, true to the source and does include a &quot;real&quot; Star Wars vehicle. But unfortunately, after building it, I come to the conclusion, that it is not as good as it seems.</p>

<p>Of course, the designs of the new troopers, and especially the helmet details, look superb. BUT the new mold of the trooper helmet has one major flaw: the trooper can not twist his head!!! And in my opinion this really minimizes the playability and displayability of these guys, which is a shame!!! And I really think we do not need any more angry clone heads, but this only by the way...</p>

<p>The second factor may be too much AFOL-orientated, but I think a lot of kids and teens will agree: We do not need any more stud-shooters for the minifigures!!! There are a lot of LEGO Star Wars blasters, that really add good detail to the whole look. But instead we get bulky oversized guns that remind me of the old days in LEGO Star Wars, where a &quot;megaphone-piece&quot; and a round stud was a gun.</p>

<p>The design of the speeder in my opinion is quite good, but too bulky. The &quot;onscreen counterpart&quot;, mentioned in the review by grandmaster CapnRex101 is a lot thinner and has only a little angle and is not that triangular when viewed from front or back. But this is, as the few of you, who have read other reviews from me may know, not a flaw in my opinion, but the &quot;masterbuilder-mission&quot; that is included in every set LEGO makes! And it&#39;s always fun, to make good things better!</p>

<p>Altogether this may be a harsh review. But I&#39;m not here to convince anybody to do this or that. These are my impressions and maybe they can be helpful to you out there. May the bricks be with you!!!</p>

After all it gives us a good look at the movie&rsquo;s plot and action scenes. This wave consists mainly of vehicles that we have already seen in the trailer, 3 land vehicles and 2 spacecrafts. It is likely that all 3 vehicles are going to participate in some sort of a chase in couple of scenes and it is great to see that one of them is available in as a cheap set. The 75207 Imperial Patrol Battle Pack consists of 4 minifigures and a speeder, which is a nice departure from typical defense structures we got in the line of battle packs.</span></p>

The second figure is a female officer, who wears Jyn Erso&rsquo;s outfit from the set 75171 and the headwear that was only available in the Death Star set and the Star Wars Advent Calendar. The figure is very well detailed and a great addition to the set. Finally there are two Range Troopers, who are the main stars. Both the suit and helmet are brand new and they are amazing. The mould for the helmet is especially complex and i hope LEGO will continue to develop such great pieces in the future. All figures are equipped with stud shooters. </span></p>

It has nothing underneath, no wheels or transparent rounded 2x2s. Shape of the speeder is created with 4 wings, which fold down to create the triangle effect. The minifigure sits between the wings of the speeder. The fit is pretty tight and the fig can barely touch the handles. The stud shooters are located at the lower front of the vehicles. While they perform their primary function, the low placement of the shooter result in their small range. The studs quickly bounce of the ground. Speeder uses most out of the 100 brick limit, however i think it could be improved with a little more pieces. A closer look reveals that, it is very see through. Yet improving the model would change it&rsquo;s classification as a battle pack build. I was thrilled seeing it on screen and i think it would be great to see it made bigger and more detailed. At the same time, the size of it is perfect when compared to the other vehicles in this wave. I have to say that i loved recreating the chase scene from the trailer. </span></p>

It gives us interesting minifigures and a fun battle pack build. Usually those kind of sets are mainly bought for the minifigures, yet this speeder is fun to play around. Also it is necessary to recreate the scenes of the movie, so it is nice that it isn&rsquo;t &nbsp;another disposable construction turret. In conclusion, i strongly recommend buying one or couple of copies of this set. </span></p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2018-12-01T02:20:22.687Z","I'd imagine that this speeder would fare well as a police craft. What do you think?","<p>It&#39;s been a little while since you&#39;ve heard from me and since I went on a Black Friday shopping spree for Lego, I&#39;m finally deciding to get back into reviewing again. Today, I&#39;ll be analyzing the Imperial Patrol Battle pack featuring a cute speeder that was briefly seen in the Solo movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The minifigures:&nbsp;</strong>I will say that I&#39;m very impressed with the minifgure selection in this battle pack, though I suppose that is what battle packs are for after all. The two new stormtroopers look fantastic, specifically featuring great printing and detailing on the helmets, but they have great printing all around. The imperial officer looks fine to me and I especially like the cap, though if you have a Star destroyer or a Death star set, they&#39;re more typical, but for a tight budget, this is another fine addition. I believe the only element unique to this officer is the unique mustached face, but don&#39;t quote me on that. Finally, the&nbsp;&nbsp;emigrations office looks vaguely similar similar to the death star troopers that appear in the latest Death Star. The only thing unique to her is the double sided face, which is the only one in the set. All in all, the minifigure selection is top notch here.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong>In my opinion, the build was very easy and I think that most people should be able to complete it in only a few minutes due to the nature of the set.</p>

<p><strong>The Complete Model:&nbsp;</strong>Though the model is small, I think it looks decent as a display piece and the stud shooters provide valuable for play. Personally, I&#39;m more of a display guy and I think the set serves well in both categories.</p>

<p><strong>My overall thoughts:&nbsp;</strong>In my opinion, I think this set is one of the better battle packs Lego has made this year because it has a great selection of minifigures and also a decent build as many battle packs lack a decent build. Not only that, but this set is fairly cheap, so it fits everyone&#39;s budget perfectly. I&#39;d definitely recommend this set to those who want to get it or as a stocking stuffer for the holidays this year.&nbsp;</p>

"I_am_Groot","2018-05-18T23:58:11.68Z","Great Battle Pack!","<p>DISCLAIMER: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS FOR SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is set 75207 Imperial Patrol Battle Pack. This set is based upon what we see in the opening sequence of Solo: a Star Wars Story.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>4 Minifigures are included; 2x Imperial Patrol Troopers, an Imperial Emigration Officer, and an Imperial Recruitment Officer, all four of which are exclusive to this set! The Imperial Patrol Troopers look pretty good with their new dual-molded helmets. I think they add a lot of value to this set. They were only in a few seconds of the movie, in fact, pretty much what you see in the trailer is the only footage. They didn&#39;t even do that much. The Emigration Officer uses a mishmash of parts: the Imperial Naval Officer helmet, the Rouge One Imperial Technician Torso, and plain black&nbsp;legs. I absolutely love the exclusive female face used, which I&#39;m sure will be extremely useful to many Star Wars MOC makers.&nbsp;Technically this is NOT an emmigration officer, but&nbsp;either a naval officer or technician.The Imperial Recruitment Officer uses another exclusive face print. The only other thing I could ask for would be a new hat-hair combo part.&nbsp;There was an Imperial Recruitment Officer in the movie (seen in the trailers)&nbsp;however the face created&nbsp;does not look like him.&nbsp;Each figure has a stud shooter and still no regular blasters are included.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is an Imperial Speeder, which yes, is actually in Solo: a Star Wars Story! Like the Imperial Patrol Troopers, it only had mere seconds of screen time. However&nbsp;I always prefer builds of real vehicles rather than things LEGO has just made up. The set includes a total of 3 white 1x1&nbsp;tiles with Imperial Logo prints which is a very nice touch. There is a seat for one Minifigure. There is a stud shooter on each side of the speeder, which doesn&#39;t look <em>too</em> bad.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is another pretty good Battle Pack.&nbsp;Although this may not be the best amy builder, the exclusive prints and parts make this worth the $15 price tag.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-01T01:11:56.23Z","Cool speeder and new exclusive troops","<p>This is not a bad battle pack, it could actually have been a set if they put in something else and increased the price by $5. I think that it is cool how they included a speeder that we actually see in the movie and not just some random speeder design that they made while they were messing around. It is also cool how they made a new stormtrooper design that was exclusive to this set. The officer in the set is not terrible but they should have put a regular stormtrooper to replace the gunner to make this an very good battle pack, but it just ended up being decent. I would definitely recommend buying 1 or 2 of these if not more if you can find them at a good discounted price of about $8-$10.</p>

"Scott1","2020-09-04T00:38:54.067Z","Another Really Good Imperial Battle Pack","<p>A lot of people didn&#39;t&nbsp;like this battle pack, and I can kind of see why. They included two officers, which some people were&nbsp;pretty vocal about. I really like the new officers/crew members though, since almost always they are included in really expensive sets, such as the UCS Super Star Destroyer, the play-scale Star Destroyers, some of the&nbsp;bigger shuttles and ships, and more. This battle pack is a great way to get a&nbsp;bunch of them for use in an Imperial lineup like when Emperor Palpatine arrived at&nbsp;the Death Star in Episode 6. They just look really good in that classic Imperial Officer outfit. The Death Star Trooper is pretty cool too, and it&#39;s awesome to get that new mould for the helmet&nbsp;in a cheap set.</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The box and instructions were pretty small, though not any smaller or bigger than the standard box for a battle pack.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>This set has some really neat parts, most notably the printed round 1x1 tiles with the Imperial insignia. It does have stud shooters &mdash; arrrrgh! &mdash; but they can easily be swapped out for the standard blasters if you don&#39;t like them.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>This set includes 2 Patrol Troopers, 1 Imperial Officer, and 1 Imperial Navy Trooper.</p>

<p>The Patrol Troopers are the highlight of this set in my eyes, though the other two minifigs are quite good as well. They just look fantastic, especially with that crisp printing and the contrast of white and black on the helmets. They almost look dual-moulded (even though they&#39;re not).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Imperial Officer is another great fig.&nbsp;Not as good as the Patrol Troopers, of course, but still really nice to get in such a cheap set. Yes, it is an officer in a battle pack, but he actually looks pretty good! Not the most detailed printing out there, but the face is nice and so is the new-ish mould for the hat. There were a TON of officers in the Imperial Army and Navy, so it&#39;s always nice to get more for cheap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Imperial Navy Trooper is really nice to get too. The new helmet&nbsp;only comes&nbsp;in the Death Star if I remember correctly, which is a $500 set.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>The build was pretty simple and short, but&nbsp;nothing beats the classic satisfaction of putting together&nbsp;4 brand new figs straight from a new battle pack!&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Playability</strong></h3>

<p>Playability is very good for what it costs. It has 6 stud-shooters in total. The only issue I can potentially see is that the speeder can only seat 1 minifig at a time, but that&#39;s an extremely minor complaint given how good the speeder actually is.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Price</strong></h3>

<p>The price is very good, as is the case with most battle packs. $15 for 4 wonderful figures and a surprisingly decent speeder&nbsp;is a great value.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>The completed model</strong></h3>

<p>The speeder is such a sleek looking design, even though it may not be 100% accurate to the film. It&#39;s still accurate enough that it would look good as part of a display, which can not be said for the vast majority of&nbsp;battle pack builds. If you don&#39;t like the stud shooters on it, they can be very easily removed.&nbsp;The minifigures look awesome on display. The Empire had a great deal of variation when it came to their soldiers; not all were Stormtroopers, after all. It&#39;s just a great battle pack that got far too much hate in my opinion than what it deserved.</p>
