"Keautay","2018-04-18T02:44:23.62Z","An instant favorite","<p>As soon as I saw this set announced, I found it superb, then bought it on day 1. I am not disappointed, even a bit surprised.</p>

<p>While the design is awesome, I found out that the building experience was the most satisfying aspect in this set. A lot of L parts are used to attach&nbsp;assemblies on the sides, front and rear, and some pieces are placed in an uncommon fashion&nbsp;underneath&nbsp;the vehicle to hide the wheels. There&#39;s no&nbsp;compromise between structure and design, the interior doesn&#39;t feel compact... everything fits!</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t much variation in the colors offered, but still, they serve the design, and&nbsp;I&nbsp;love the&nbsp;printed 2x2 fans on the hood and engine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t play with my sets (well, ok, sometimes), but I think this one has great potential for kids. You can open&nbsp;the energy tank at the rear, remove the hood and the engine, fire lasers like on most spaceships&nbsp;and, as the wheels are not far apart, it can drift&nbsp;easily&nbsp;(like we can see in the trailer).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Both characters&nbsp;look great, with muddy details on their boots and pants (presumably because they had to repair the engine in the dirt), and the hound is a cool addition.</p>

<p>It was 35 CAD, for 345 parts. So 10 cents/part before taxes, which is great value nowadays.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bonus:&nbsp;No stickers!</p>

<p>Edit: I forgot to mention that there is a lot of storage room under the hood, which is very useful for a smuggler.</p>

"Maudib","2018-04-18T04:22:34.153Z","Wonderful new build style","<p>This was a very fun build. Starting off with bag 1 it seems like a standard Star Wars land speeder build. By bag 2 you realize the magic and wonderful design hidden at the core of the build. Kudos to the designer for the awesome part choice, color design, and slick style of this build. Can&#39;t wait for the movie to come out because this thing looks like it can move. Definitely takes cues from early American Muscle car design.</p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2018-06-11T02:57:47.21Z","This is a landspeeder you definitely won't see Luke Skywalker use","<p>Hello guys, I&#39;m back with another review. Instead of getting another Infinity War set, I decided to take a break to review one of the sets from the Solo line.&nbsp; Luckily for all of you, I have not seen the movie as of yet, so this review will contain no spoilers whatsoever. Therefore, I will only be judging this based on my experiences and not on accuracy. Without further a do, let&#39;s get into the review.</p>

<p><strong>Figures:</strong></p>

<p>I feel that covering the box and instructions is getting kind of boring because there&#39;s really not much to them. So, to change this up, I&#39;m skipping that section and starting with my personal favorite section.&nbsp; This set doesn&#39;t have many figures, but they look very nice. Both of the figures have a sort of camo/ rugged look to them. I love Han Solo&#39;s new hairpiece, as well as the print on his legs. He sports a dark gray shirt and a white jacket. Qu&#39;ra&nbsp;sports a dark gray jacket and a wonderful crimson undershirt (red is my favorite color after all). She has nice printing on her legs, but I think Han&#39;s is better.</p>

<p><strong>Building it:</strong></p>

<p>Now, like normal, the build shouldn&#39;t take too long. However, the one tip I have this time is to look at the instructions carefully at certain parts as they can appear to be deceiving. Also, the build is never boring, having switch from different sections and never seeming too repetitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>Whether for play or display, I think the model looks very nice. It has a rugged beat up look, greatly looking like something from a planet starved by the Empire or a speeder modded by everyone&#39;s space pirate. The speeder is also very interactive, featuring a removable engine, spring loaded shooters and it can really spin (on smooth surfaces). At the same time, none of these features interfere with the model&#39;s appearance for display</p>

<p><strong>Overall thoughts:</strong></p>

<p>This set is another great set. For those on a tight budget, it provides two star characters of the film, along with a nice speeder for a pretty affordable price. Also, it has a very nice look to it (for those who display it) and has many features (for the kids!). Even if you&#39;re not on a tight budget, this is not a set to miss, as I do believe this plays a fairly significant role in the film (but I can&#39;t say for certain) and is fairly fun to build (despite being fairly cheap). Not only that, but is you&#39;re a fan or looking for something fun to build or even want a build that kind of looks like a sports car, I recommend this set for you.&nbsp;</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-10-06T16:35:16.67Z","The best speeder yet?","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Han Solo&#39;s Landspeeder&nbsp;figures only briefly in the movie, but is still arguably the most iconic vehicle after the Milennium Falcon in this movie. It is recognizable, looks good, and in many ways &#39;Han Solo&#39;: a bit of a bodge job. The Lego designers have done a good job turning it into a Lego set, and just as important, at a reasonable price - at least in most markets. The build was fun, not difficult and fairly quick. IMHO this set fits well in any Star Wars collection. It&nbsp;also makes for a good play set, being very swooshable. The two minifigs, the Corellian Hound, the hiding spaces, all are nice elements. Overall, I think this a good set,&nbsp;arguably - when looking at size, pieces, minifigures, looks, and price - the best set of the Solo movie wave.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build was fun. Logically divided into three rather small bags, the whole build took me a little under an hour. First the core of the vehicle is built, then - using a lot of SNOT - the outside of the vehicle, and finally the spoiler. There are some bright coloured pieces used in the construction of the vehicle, but thankfully they are covered up very well. The greebling is well done, and I like the way the front of the vehicle is constructed. The construction of the front grille I liked especially.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are two minifigures and a Corellian&nbsp;Hound included in this set. Both Han Solo and Qui&#39;Ra&nbsp;are IMHO well done. Both have dual face prints, nice hair pieces and a nice print on both sides of the torso. Their legs and pants have a very nice print of grey mud stains. The prints are continued nicely and in register. Han&#39;s jacket has some stains on the front and back. Overall, very good.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The Landspeeder&nbsp;resembles the vehicle from the movie quite nicely. Brightly coloured&nbsp;bricks, as well as the wheel hubs used to mate the speeder &#39;float&#39; are hidden away nicely. The spring-loaded shooters are equally well incorporated - the only evidence they are there is provided by the tails of the bolts sticking out. Unlike so often, the undercarriage hiding these elements is in colour, which works well. I like the way fairly simple but effective greebling on the left hand side has come out. The design of the removable bonnet is good, and opens up a large space underneath. The hiding spaces there fit an extra bolt and wrench nicely. The &#39;engine&#39; components look good. Similarly well hidden is the smuggling compartment in the rear. As said, this is a top design, IMHO.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This set is a mix between a play vs display set. As a play set, it is very swooshable, can shoot, has hidden compartments, minifigures are easy to put in and take out... all great play elements. About the only thing missing would be an enemy, other than the Corellian&nbsp;Hound to run away from.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vehicle itself simply looks good, and IMHO looks better and offers better value for money than Moloch&#39;s speeder. This speeder has still some resemblance to the 1960&#39;s/1970&#39;s American luxury cars, while Moloch&#39;s speeder simply looks like a massive gray lump. Given the right setting, this speeder definitely looks good as a display set, on its own, or in a &#39;speeder&#39; line-up.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this could well be the best set of the Solo movie-based sets, looking at the package as a whole. Even its price-per-part is at a level rarely seen anymore for any Star Wars set in most places on earth. If you can find this set for a reasonable price, I would say go for it - as a gift or a piece of one&#39;s own collection.</p>

"I_am_Groot","2018-05-31T03:06:34.92Z","One of the best Star Wars sets of all time!","<p>WARNING: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS FOR SOLO: A STAR WARS STORY.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a review of 75209 Han Solo&#39;s Landspeeder. It contains two minifigures, 345 pieces, and retails for $29.99 in the U.S. This set is based on the opening scene of Solo: a Star Wars Story where Moloch was chasing Qi&#39;Ra and Han. It didn&#39;t get too much screen time and it&#39;s a shame that it ended up being stuck sideways in an alleyway. Either way, I think that this is still&nbsp;a fantastic set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two figures included are young Han Solo and young Qi&#39;Ra, both of which are based on how they appeared on Corellia in the opening scene. It&#39;s always nice to get one main character in a small set, not to mention two. Han Solo looks fantastic, with lots of detailing on the legs and torso. Both face prints are great. Qi&#39;Ra, my...&nbsp;um... I mean Han Solo&#39;s&nbsp;girlfriend,&nbsp; looks&nbsp;beyond fantastic.&nbsp;Her hair is a brand new and exclusive mold and I think it is absolutely&nbsp;<em>spot on</em>. The torso and leg prints also look fantastic and extremely well detailed&nbsp;although dual molded legs and printing on the sides for the skirt would be great.&nbsp;The face print is pretty good.&nbsp;I think enlarging the eyebrows and lips was definitely a step in the right direction, but it still&nbsp;doesn&#39;t look quite as&nbsp;accurate as I&#39;d like it to. I like the sad expression, but the happy one looks a bit off to me. Overall, this is by far my favorite figure in the entire Solo&nbsp;wave (maybe even one of my favorite minifigs&nbsp;all time?) and&nbsp;Han is not very&nbsp;far behind. Also included are two mini blasters and a Corellian Hound, which&nbsp;also looks&nbsp;pretty good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the figures, aren&#39;t already enough to make you buy this set, the build should be. Just like the 75176 Resistance Transport Pod, it is surprising how much detail and&nbsp;play value the designer put&nbsp;into such a small build.&nbsp;The overall shape and size is&nbsp;extremely accurate. They even got the accurate shaping&nbsp;for the bottom! The two spring loaded shooters stick out quite a bit but can easily be left off. There are also four wheels on the bottom which are barley visible and add a lot of play value as well as having the effect that the speeder is hovering. I love all of the dark bluish gray pieces used to represent damage. It looks like this thing has been through a lot! In universe, the speeder has two white stripes on the right side. Here, this is represented by a row of 1 x 2 grill tile pieces, which of course makes three stripes, however this doesn&#39;t bug me a bit. The cockpit looks&nbsp;beyond fantastic&nbsp;with an <strong>all tan</strong> interior. Yep, that&#39;s right, no crazy colors showing up at all! It is also very spacious and has a printed 2 x 2 tile in the center as well as a bucket handle piece used to represent a steering wheel. There is even some extra room behind the seats where you can put the mini blasters. The big &quot;wing&quot; on the back also looks superb complete with the circular hole on the right side but I wish they had used&nbsp;black or dark blue&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;light bluish gray 1 x 2 bracket piece. The back looks great as well with two large thrusters as well as a small storage compartment (which is actually a crate piece on it&#39;s side) with some Coaxium in it, just like han used to bribe the Imperial Emmigration Officer with to get past the checkpoint. There is also very large storage compartment in the front part of the speeder with space to store a wrench and the extra spring loaded shooter bolt (which is always a good thing) and you may can even fit some other stuff in it. There is also a stack of two 2 x 2 trans-neon green dish pieces possibly representing fuel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final verdict:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just like the title says, I think this may be one of the best LEGO&nbsp;Star Wars sets of all time, certainly the best in this wave. Not only are the minifigs fantastic and possibly the two best in this wave, but the build is fantastic&nbsp;too. In my opinion, this an absolute MUST BUY for any Star Wars fan, kids or adults, like the&nbsp;movie or not. This&nbsp;also a much cheaper way to get Han and Qi&#39;Ra than&nbsp;the&nbsp; $170 75212 Kessel Run Millenium Falcon.&nbsp;The price to part ratio is also very good for a Star Wars set at $30 for 345 pieces. Overall, this set gets 5 stars on all five counts and I hope LEGO continues to make sets of this level of quality in the future.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my review. :)</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-01T02:36:05.683Z","Awesome Speeder","<p>The mini figures in this look so good with the printing on the legs and torsos being really detailed. The Corellian hound is a nice throw-in but some kind of Corellian worker or stormtrooper would have been really great. The main reason I bought the set was because of the speeder. It looks so good with the main color as navy and the black and white stripes at the front. The arch at the back looks sleek, and it adds a look of customization with the paneling on the side being removed exposing the inner mechanics of the speeder. The underside has wheels that are barley lower than the main floor so it gives the appearance of hovering which is awesome. You can even open the hood of the speeder and take things out to make repairs. This is by far one of the coolest and most playable speeders LEGO has ever made. I highly recommend picking this up before its too late.</p>

"CaptainKindling","2020-10-03T14:54:48.053Z","Stunning little speeder, but Han needs to shoot (first) whoever designed the instructions.","<p>The 2018 release of Solo: A Star Wars Story obviously resulted in its own wave of tie-in Lego sets, but there was one glaring issue with this run. With the obvious exception of the Millennium Falcon itself, which saw a release with a whole new &quot;Kessel Run&quot; look, there were few&nbsp;iconic ships to be found in the movie, leading to a range of sets which may not have seemed initially obvious.&nbsp; Two of these were Moloch&#39;s landspeeder, and the speeder we see Han hotwiring at the beginning of the movie, allowing fans to recreate the chase scene.</p>

<p>Han&#39;s Landspeeder at first might not seem like too exciting a prospect, but with an initial retail price of &pound;25, and a current eBay value of just over &pound;20 sealed, this 345 piece set is great value for money.</p>

<p>The build is split up into 3 bags, and for me it took bang-on 1 hour to assemble.&nbsp; The first thing I would have to say about this set is that the colour scheme is stunning.&nbsp; With the majority of Star Wars sets being black or shades of grey, the dark blue colour of this speeder is absolutely beautiful.&nbsp; However, this is also a double edged sword, as it makes the instructions very difficult to decipher at quite a few points in the build.&nbsp; Out of the 40+ Star Wars sets I&#39;ve built in the last few years, this has hands-down been the most horrible set of instructions I&#39;ve come across, and I can&#39;t stress this enough.</p>

<p>That said, the build itself is fantastic.&nbsp; Being a small set there isn&#39;t really any repetition, and it&#39;s great fun to see the set come together,&nbsp; There aren&#39;t any stickers in this set, which will please a great number of fans.&nbsp; There&#39;s a tremendous amount of detail for its size, from the exposed left-hand side of the bodywork to the engine underneath the hood, to the vial of Coaxium stashed in the rear of the speeder.&nbsp; The whole model is raised slightly on a set of small rollers, allowing it to glide over smooth surfaces without it being visibly obvious that it&#39;s running on wheels.&nbsp; One odd feature though is the decision to set a couple of spring-loaded shooters onto the underside of the speeder.&nbsp; While this does give an added degree of playability for younger fans, they feel a completely unnecessary add-on for what is essentially a car, and the missiles protrude conspicuously from the rear of the speeder.&nbsp; No one ever saw Luke&#39;s landspeeder from A New Hope and said &quot;Hey, that thing needs some firepower!&quot;, so I&#39;m not sold on the addition to Han&#39;s speeder.</p>

<p>As far as minifigures go, you might not get many in this set but what you get should make you happy.&nbsp; Young Han Solo looks great with the modern hair piece, and this is the cheapest set to get your hands on Emilia Clarke&#39;s Qi&#39;ra.&nbsp; Both have double-faced heads for more casual or intense expressions, and each comes with a blaster pistol.&nbsp; The Corellian Hound is also a nice touch, especially if you have Moloch&#39;s Landspeeder to complete the scene.&nbsp; Even without it though, it&#39;s still a great little figure to own.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a beautiful and tremendously detailed model for a very reasonable price. The minifigure selection is great, and really the only let-down in this set is the headache-inducing instruction manual.&nbsp; Would highly recommend to anyone looking for a small set to fill a gap in their collection.</p>

<p>Han Solo: He&#39;s in this outfit for all of about 5 minutes. It is, nonetheless, a very nice outfit and quite detailed.</p>

<p>Pretty straightforward. There&#39;s just the speeder, after all. There&#39;s some decent SNOT&nbsp; work along every side and good greebling. It looks very close to the &quot;real thing&quot; and is a very nice art deco-y design. It also reminds me a bit of the Ford Mustang. Still, it&#39;s exactly what you expect. Wheels work pretty well too.</p>

"AlkkuV","2022-02-03T14:19:09.34Z","The second landspeeder.","<p>Hello guys, it&#39;s AlkkuV, back with another review. Today&#39;s review is set number: 75209 Han Solo&#39;s Landspeeder. This set came out April 2018 and retired July 2019.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box and Instructions: Box art is actually pretty good. It looks like some kind of bridge and there are TIE Fighters flying at the back. The instructions were clear and had 95 pages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures and Creatures: There are two mini-figs and one creature in this set. The minifigures are unique to this set. The creature is: Corellian Hound. This creature came out in the Moloch&#39;s Landspeeder (you can check out my review for that set too. Set number 75210). The minifigures are: Han Solo White Jacket, Black Legs with Dirt Stains and Qi&#39;ra - Jacket with Collar. They are unique to this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: This set comes with 345 pieces. The torso and legs for the mini-figs are new and so is Qi&#39;ra&#39;s hair. The set comes with a lot of Earth Blue pieces, such as: Window Frame 1x2x2 2/3, Plate 2x16 and Plate 6x8.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: The set comes with three numbered bags. In the first one you get Solo, the hound and the base of the speeder. In the second and third one, you just get Qi&#39;ra and the build the rest of the speeder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complete Build: Overall this set is amazing. The only downside is the playability. If you have the Moloch&#39;s Lanspeeder the playability changes, but with only this set it&#39;s not that good. Everything else is fabulous. Overall I would give this set a 4.9/5.</p>
