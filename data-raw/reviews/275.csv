"William_the_Conqueror","2007-03-28T22:34:34.91Z","Nice Little Set","This really is a great little set. For not too much money, you can get a very good exclusive mummy (with a switch-around head for sleeping and awake), a special trap door, and a special lion carving piece. The piece selection kinda reminds me of a Harry Potter-themed set, but I personally think it's pretty good!

Oh! I forgot! The real reason I wanted this set was for the evil skull face. This set is REALLY GREAT for getting cool special parts for a cheap price!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-05-03T16:38:48.623Z","Tomb of the pharaoh","This is a small set released in 2002, with the studios theme. This set is really so much small,, so, by extension it is so much simple. But it was cheap, and also useful, this set includes tons of useful pieces.
 
Well designed, but easily builted, this set features the two minifigures included. The original Lego skeleton, completely white (with some black details on the face), and with a good shape, not exactly the Lego original shape, but different, featuring some details  in the body, and different legs and arms. The arms came connected with the body, unlike the new skeletons. It makes the movements of the arms more playable, and more like skeletons. The skeleton minifigure included with this shape is common in some other sets, like in the adventurers theme, turning it cool and more useful.

The pharaoh minifigure is too simple, but nicely designed, and have some differences from the mummy fromthe adventurers subtheme, this is more gray, and also more detailed, but still in the same shape. This minifigure is useful, another addition, and can be increased with the pharaoh's helm.

The set, altough includes two useful and good minifigures, overall is so much simple. A black coloured small plate is used as a base for this small tomb. The tomb is basically all the few building involved in this set. The small &quot;walls&quot; of this tomb are made by different gray bricks, with some alternated shapes and schales, and these makes increasings to the design, featuring three bricks with semi triangular shape on each side of the tomb. Inside, there is the sufficient space to put the minifigure, the skeleton or the pharaoh.

Above, there are some beige bricks with also, different shapes and sizes, increasing it, and featuring on the piece of the front, the shape of a head of a lion. It isn't exactly much ancient egyptian like, but it still cool, and it works well, is easy open and close without dismantle it. The building, altough few, isn't bad, and the design, also, still nice for a small set. This set includes some oher useful itens, like the cool transluscent green spider, and two orange pieces used as torches, a black scorpion (few detailed, and made by just a brick, but useful and in some themes cool) and another skeleton face, too useful.

Overall, this small set is so much useful. Like the other sets wih the same size, the playability is bad, but it increases any studios or adventurers sets, and also features a good design and color scheme. If you find it, in a cheap price, it will be a good chance to get some stuff from the studios theme, and also, some useful pieces. In comparison with other sets with the same small size and approximated number of pieces, it gets a 4.7/5, more due to the color scheme and pieces used on it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The glowing skull is very cool and is a great Lego piece. The tomb is the best part of the set because it has so much detail to it. Also, there are no cameramen which is even better. It is one of the best Studios sets ever!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-25T14:27:37.95Z","&quot;I hate mummies! They never play fair!&quot;","This is a very neat little set. The pieces are now mixed in with my bucket of Lego bricks, but the mummy minifig is still in one location, at least. As previous reviewers have stated, this is a GREAT source of pieces and includes the first mummy since the Adventurers subtheme. Also included are a skeleton, scorpion, small crypt, neon spider, and glow-in-the-dark skull. Very cool. Also useful if you have other Lego Studios horror sets. You can have Frankenstein steal the mummy's headress while he's fighting with the vampire while HE'S pulling off the werewolf's head while HE'S trying to scare the tourists!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Fire","2011-05-16T02:45:57.93Z","Great little set!","<DIV class=description>
<p>I got this set when it first came out, and it was one of the starter sets for what is now my expanded Haunted Village (which has basically become a medieval village with the haunted portion at the center).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is fantastic, one of the best small sets LEGO has ever made.&nbsp; The mummy fig is simply awesome, and the tomb itself is also pretty cool.&nbsp; It also includes a glow-in-the-dark skull, a neon spider, and an always useful skeleton.&nbsp; It will fit in great with the new Pharaoh's Quest theme, and&nbsp;mine currently resides in the cemetery of my village.</p></DIV>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"water_jedi_17","2008-10-31T21:28:18.263Z","Halloween review!","One of Lego’s studios sets, this set could be multi used as it does not have any cameramen or other stuff in the other sets
The tomb has a lion like creature and behind it there is a compartment containing a glow in the dark skull. The ‘tail’ in behind the head can go up and release the skull. To make the set more realistic, the skeleton has a piece on it’s neck that allows him to hang on the back of the tomb. Although in the sarcophagus there is no resting place, the mummy can somewhat rise from his tomb. The mummy has a double faced head with a sleep and awake head. Two animals are also included :a scorpion and a tans green spider. A final note is that it contains a comic showing the set in action. All the pieces can be used to make a tomb in Indiana Jones to using the mummy’s head for character mocs including the batman villain Hush and Scarecrow(from Batman Begins)

"jonbuddy","2011-07-06T08:18:22.333Z","Back when prices were reasonable...","<p>I'm finally reviewing again, this time using the Eurobricks format. But enough about this, let's get on to the review.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I can't quite remember what the box looked like, but I'm sure it was very small. The instructions were very straightforward because the set is miniature.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>It's pretty obvious why I rated parts 5/5: the Pharaoh! He is a great minifig. Other notable parts include the glow-in-the-dark skeleton head, and I believe the glow-in-the-dark scorpion is in this one too.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>I repeat: the Pharaoh was the showcase-er (??? :P)&nbsp;and the centerpiece for this model. There's also a skeleton that you can stick (with a one-dot round piece, of course) to the bottom of the sphinx-like statue that can flip out.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The build was very short and uncomplicated. The 2/5 building experience score is not negativity.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>This model, however tiny, is still a great set and has loads of playability by itself. (...) (continued below)</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>You cannot just buy this&nbsp;set alone, however. To get the full Studios experience, you need to get 1380, 1381, and 1382 as well. Unless you want to pay out the wazoo on Ebay, just getting this and maybe one more will do. Overall, 5/5. Great set. Get it and the others if you haven't already.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>jonbuddy</p>",TRUE,5,5,2,5,5
"DrisDeLLe_BricK","2008-11-28T15:59:49.53Z","AWESOME SET!","I got this set when I went to Walt Disney and when I bought it, I could'nt wait to build it. The result, very awesome! Probably my favorite part in this set is the mummy, it's the best mummy I've ever seen so far in a LEGO set. This is a must have for all LEGO studios &quot;scary monsters&quot; fan, and if you're looking to buy this set, go to bricklink.com, and there are a few sellers that want to sell this set, new and used. AWESOME SET!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ledaKat","2009-11-07T05:23:32.733Z","Best Mummy","This is a fantastic, albiet tiny, set. The mummy is perfect. Absolutely perfect. The set is tiny, but easy to expand upon if you have lots of sand coloured bricks and a liking for the Adventurers Egypt series.  As with the Vampire from the same theme, the Mummy has a dual face. Open eyes and sleeping eyes.  And yes, there is a glow in the dark skull!

Although it is small, it is well designed. I like the lion/spynx-type roof of the sargophagous. My only con would be that the spider has nowhere to sit, wherever you attach him his legs get in the way. A great addition to the monster studios theme - and a must have minifig.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-22T12:28:19.57Z","You are Cursed, Cursed I say!","<p>Set #1383 Curse of the Pharaoh: Welcome to the Pharaoh's tomb, won't you stay for... Ever! MWAHAHAHAHAHA!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is a fun and cheap little addition to any LEGO Collection. I really had a blast with it until I sold it to make room for other LEGO sets, but there is a chance I'll be able to pick it up again someday because it's really a great little set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The model depicts the resting place of a mummy, it's built with dark grey elements and tan pieces for the top of the Sarcophogus. Flip the top open and you can terrify anybody with the mummy or the skeleton. The real gem of this set however is the new Mummy Mini-Figure, I think it might be the basis for the new Pharaoh's Quest mummies actually. The printing looks similar to them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This mummy has a double-sided head, one awake, the other side sleeping. The skeleton Mini-Figure is a bothersome pest for the mummy according to the little comic at the back of the instructions, it is the older Skeleton Mini-Figure from before LEGO introduced the new torso piece with the sturdier arms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also included is a black scorpion, a transparent green spider and an extra Ogel's Minion Skeleton head that I think was meant to glow in the dark, but I'm not sure if it actually does.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd recommend this set to anyone who wants it. It is a great fun little set with a funny comic in the instructions and a great looking mummy Mini-Figure, he'd make a great addition to any Pharaoh's Quest mummy based sets and there are a few other rare pieces with this set, such as the headdress worn by the mummy and the lion shaped brick on the sarcophogus. Perfect for MOCers.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,4,5
