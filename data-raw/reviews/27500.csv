<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, this is set 75210 Moloch&#39;s Landspeeder. It comes with two figures, two Corellian Hounds, 464 pieces, and retails for $40 USD. It turns out that everything in this set, along with two other sets in this wave,&nbsp;only appeared in the opening&nbsp;sequence of Solo: a&nbsp;Star Wars Story.&nbsp;It&nbsp;didn&#39;t even play&nbsp;that big of a role. However, I still thought that it was pretty cool and memorable. Can I say the same for this set? Let&#39;s take a look and find out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite this set&#39;s $40 price point, it only contains two actual minifigures. It would have been nice to get three or even four, but I&#39;m not sure what else they could have given us aside from another figure similar to Rebolt. Speaking of Rebolt, take off is headpiece and he is a fantastic figure. I absolutely love the torso leg, and face prints(complete with his scar), but the headpiece is completely reused from the &quot;Pao&quot; minifig released in 2016. In the movie, his headpiece is similar but not at all the same. It is supposed to split apart in the back, but on this figure it&nbsp;is simply just represented by&nbsp;printing on the back of the torso.&nbsp;The orange thing on the front is also absent in this LEGO version. He includes a coiled leash which unfortunately cannot be attached to the Corellian Hounds. It also would have been nice to get a staff for Rebolt. Despite all of my complaints, in the end it does not bug me TOO much as Rebolt got pretty little screen time, only appearing&nbsp;the opening sequence. Moloch on the other hand is a great figure. He got decent screen time in the opening sequence. The print on the torso is great. His new dress piece looks fantastic as it is printed on the front AND back, something that we never got when they were using the&nbsp;1 x 3 x 2 slope pieces to represent minifig dresses.&nbsp;Moloch also uses a brand new one-piece head. The only thing holding it back from being perfect is that the two tubes hanging off the front are absent, most likely due to the fact that they would have been easy to break off. Moloch also includes a staff and blaster gun. In addition to these two figures, two Corellian Hounds are included. They look decent, but they&nbsp;didn&#39;t play nearly as big of a role as I thought they would in Solo.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only build included in this set is Moloch&#39;s Landspeeder. It was much smaller than I expected it to be, only about the size of Han Solo&#39;s Landspeeder. The designer did a good job of capturing its dirty look without using ANY stickers. It mainly consists of dark tan, light bluish gray, and dark bluish gray making it have a rather dull look, however it does use some interesting techniques and studs-on-the-side construction. It has a six-shooter on the front which can be activated by turning the disk on the side, which is integrated in very nicely. There is a cage on the right side&nbsp;that will open to&nbsp;fit both Corellian Hounds. The cockpit also opens up to seat Moloch. I love how they did the gap for the large back part. This looks very accurate even though no curved parts are used on the bottom. The back of the speeder has two large engines. Sadly the exhaust is colored orange instead of light blue, which&nbsp;is actually the biggest complaint I have for the build. There is also a a part on the back which can be opened up. Inside is a small build with four clips, two holding bones, a water/food trough, and a slot for the extra six studs included. I feel they could have maybe done something a little better with that space though. It is also a shame that for such a large build, there are no other storage compartments. Also, there are four wheels on the bottom, which is very useful. However, they are super close the the craft so do not do too well on carpet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final verdict:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So overall, not a bad set, but not a good one either. The fact that only two figures are included, one of which is inaccurate, is very bad. The speeder looks very accurate and I love all of the texturing, coloring, and smooth finish&nbsp;of the craft. But it just doesn&#39;t do that much for it&#39;s size. Overall, unless you are a big fan of Solo or just Star Wars in general, I would not recommenced it at its retail price, especially when&nbsp;compared to Han Solo&#39;s Landspeeder which is much better&nbsp;not to mention&nbsp;$10 cheaper. I give it 3/5 stars on all five counts.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoyed my review!</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-01T20:14:55.423Z","Pretty good speeder","<p>&nbsp;The set is not bad for $40 with a good price per piece ratio. It has some nice smaller gray, dark gray, and a couple tan pieces that are all great for grebiling on MOCs. The minifigures are nice and we getsome exclusive head and torso prints in this set. The hounds are cool in that they are a new mold and they both fit in a cage on the side of the speeder. There is ample storage space in the back which is very nice. The only downside is that the pilot of the speeder must always stand due to the way it is built for Moloch who has a robe/dress piece instead of legs. It would have also been nice to get another figure with this because most people don&#39;t consider the corellian hounds as minifigures. I would definitly recommend getting this if you are a fan of speeders or have Solo&#39;s Landspeeder because they work well together. I would recommend this set to most people.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box and Instructions: The box art was nothing special, and the instructions were clear and had 141 pages.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures and creatures: This set has two minifigures and two creatures. The minifigures were Moloch and Rebolt. They are unique to this set. Moloch carries a pistol and a walking stick. Rebolt has a whip, so he can command the hounds. The two creatures as I already told you are hounds. Two Corellian hounds that fit into the speeder.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: There are 464 pieces in the set. Some rare pieces are: The whip, Moloch&#39;s head and the hounds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: The build was nice and easy, and&nbsp;the landspeeder is built very bulky and the studshooter works well. There is also a little container for bones and a bag, that fits into the back of the speeder. Moloch fits well into the cockpit and there is a place for the hounds on the opposite side of the studshooter. The only thing that bothers me is that there is no place for Rebolt to be in. Does he just have to run when Moloch is driving the speeder?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complete build: Overall the set is a one that you should get if you&#39;re a Solo fan or if it&#39;s on sale. The minifigures and creatures are okay, and the speeder is good. There is not much playability because there is no good guys in the set. I would give this set a 4/5.</p>

<p>(I&#39;ll be doing one review per day) Thanks for reading and stay toon for more review&#39;s!</p>
