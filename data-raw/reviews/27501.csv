"xboxtravis7992","2018-06-29T04:01:14.063Z","Pricey TIE Fighter is a Stunning Update","<p>Well, its hard to believe that it has been six years since our last classic Imperial Tie Fighter, and three since the First Order Tie Fighter; but here we are! New movie and a new Tie remake to go along with it! How does this set compare ,especially clocking in at the heavy weight price tag of $70 USD?<br />
<br />
<strong>The Figures</strong></p>

<p><em>Han Solo</em>; If I were to pick my favorite Imperial soldier variant introduced in Solo... it would be the rank &amp; file group of Mudtroopers that Han Solo served in before defecting from the Empire. This is a pretty cool take on that, with a new helmet mold with goggles hanging above the brow, a new cloak, and an awesome torso print on a gray body featuring shades of sand green, and speckles of dirty gray mud. This is a pretty cool figure, and feels both futuristic and down to earth at the same time. The head piece used for Han is the same used in the other Solo sets. If I have one big&nbsp;complaint, is that this figure doesn&#39;t look dirty enough... (although it looks like an even muddier version of Han as a Mudtrooper&nbsp;will be coming out as a <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40300-1/Han-Solo-Mudtrooper"">standalone figure</a>&nbsp;later on this year). With that said, I like the Han that comes with this set;&nbsp;yet I wish it included one more Mudtrooper type figure since I like this design so much.<br />
<br />
<em>Mimban Stormtrooper</em>; Another Imperial troop variant, the Mimban stormtrooper is a weather adapted version of the classic stormtrooper armor. The figure is in light gray, and it wears the same stiff cloak as the Han Solo figure does. The helmet is a new mold, to show the slight bumb in the forehead where Mimban Stormtrooper armor contains additional sensor equipment to help troopers navigate on stormy Mimban. I don&#39;t really know if a new mold was needed to capture such a small detail variant, but I do think it looks good. Like Han, there are flecks of mud and grime on the trooper; although he still looks a little to clean in my opinion. Also, I wish the set came with one more of these guys... especially since one gray dirtied up trooper looks weird standing by itself alongside polished white classic Stormtrooper figures. I hope a battlepack will come out someday with these unique Mimban troopers!<br />
<br />
<em>TIE Fighter Pilot</em>; why oh why does Lego keep redesigning this guy?!? It seems every year Lego has yet another small tweak to make to the TIE Fighter pilots, and this guy is no exception with some modifications to his helmet. Admittedly, small variations in TIE Fighter pilot helmets is accurate to the Star Wars films&nbsp;going all the way back to A New Hope... but its starting to just get silly how Lego seems to be chasing their tail to capture all these subtle differences; especially considering they are nowhere near as iconic as the paint variants on the Rebel helmets. I love how this figure looks, but I also love how the half the TIE fighter pilots we have gotten in the last few years have looked to! Please, just make a TIE pilot design and stick to it for a few years okay?<br />
<br />
<em>Tobias Beckett</em>; Woody Harrelson makes his Lego debut, here in the disguise his character wears during his infiltration of the Imperial frontline on Mimban to steal an AT-Hauler. I like the subtle smirk on this figure, and frankly the Imperial officer duds make him a great battlefield variant; just switch out his head and Star Wars fans have a new officer design to lead their troops into battle! Like Han, he has some tan and gray printing on his body to represent mud, and I am glad Lego refrained from including the blaster holes in the film which the costume had; allowing it to be an even more versatile torso print.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>This new TIE Fighter uses many of the updated methods last seen in the First Order variant, along with a dash of inspiration from the UCS TIE Figther to create one of the most detailed Star Wars set I have built in a while. The build is never really bland, with constant greebling and SNOT work to get all the shapes just right. I love how it comes together, and its a real step up from its 2012 predecessor!<br />
<br />
<strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>So how does the set feel completed? Size wise, this is very similar to the previous TIE Fighters; and in a similar scale to the TIE Advanced, Silencer, and Striker variants we have gotten in the last few years. The detail is awesome, and I think this will be the definitive Lego System scale TIE Fighter for quite some time to come!<br />
<br />
But... lets talk that price. $70 felt a bit to much for what came here. I know the previous TIE fighter variants have all been recently coming out at the same price, but this set feels like it lacks as much as&nbsp;some of those&nbsp;prior sets had.&nbsp;I wish the price was at least $10 lower, or maybe if&nbsp;the set came with one or two more figures to really make that investment feel worth it I would have felt the price would have been justified. The model and figures do not disappoint, but wait for it on discount for the best opportunity to get it. Other than that, this is a stellar addition to the Star Wars lineup, and worthy of display for any Original Trilogy era fan&nbsp;looking for this classic ship!</p>

However, if there ever was set that tempted me to break this rule, it was 75211 Imperial TIE Fighter, an iconic Original Trilogy vehicle masquerading as a Solo set. Representing the first incarnation of this vessel since the TIE series design reached new levels of brilliance in 2015, I naturally I had high expectations for this set, expectations I&#39;m pleased to say were met in spectacular fashion. </span></span></span></p>

The build was spread out across four stages,&nbsp;with two bags for the third and one for the rest. As I was constructing the model, there were two details in particular that caught my eye. The first is the incorporation of the pentagonal Minecraft track piece, which fits in seamlessly with the myriad small slopes used around the cockpit. I was particularly pleased by the fact that these pieces were used on the back as well, displaying excellent symmetry with the front of the vessel. No less pleasing was the the use of superfluous ratchet&nbsp;hinges on the pylons near the wing, with the only purpose of these attachments being to add some attractive detail. Overall, 75211 had a decent, quick build, one that was made all the more enjoyable by the fact that there wasn&#39;t a sticker to be found.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

First on the docket for analysis is <strong>Han Solo</strong> in his mudtrooper garb, a figure that is as excellent as he is mud splattered. The helmet mold with the goggles print and the irregularly cut&nbsp; waterproof cape are highly accurate, with the stiff fabric of the latter allowing a hood and folds to be printed on the back. My sole critique of the Han Solo figure in this set would be the head print, as neither side reflects Han&#39;s emotions in the film. In lieu of the bland smile and frustrated expressions we now have, I would have preferred Han&#39;s famous cocksure grin and a look of panic. Serving in the trenches alongside Han are <strong>Mimban&nbsp;stormtroopers</strong>, one of whom is included in this set. While the legs and torso are essentially those of a normal stormtrooper&#39;s colored light gray and liberally splattered with tan and dark gray muck, the helmet is a new component entirely, with a more pronounced forehead indicating that the designer was aware of the additional sensory equipment housed there. This attention to detail is exemplary, and it coupled with the second appearance of the new slick mean that my only gripe with the figure is the fact that it seems like he will be only the one of his kind we ever receive, making it rather difficult&nbsp;to accumulate an army of them. In spite of his garb&nbsp;as an Imperial officer <strong>Tobias Beckett</strong> is decidedly apathetic about the military campaigns of the Empire, only coming to Mimban&nbsp;to steal an AT-Hauler. This figure reflects those motives, with Beckett&#39;s Imperial issue trench coat, kepi, and breastplate contrasting with his non-regulation silver pistols. Overall this is a splendid figure, with the rank badge for once being accurate to the film and the trench coat lining up perfectly as it continues onto the legs, which are also printed with tan straps.&nbsp;I should note that on both Beckett and Han the silver of their belt buckles is at least partially obscured by mud, a delightful adaption of the Imperial aesthetic to suit the filthy world. Beckett&#39;s face is a nice representation of Woody Harrelson&#39;s badly shaven face, though the placid expression is a little bland. Finally, though the kepi should have goggles printed on it, I&#39;m willing&nbsp;to let it slide considering&nbsp;that&nbsp;it wouldn&#39;t&nbsp;add enough to the character to merit the new mold/print. The final figure included is the requisite <strong>TIE pilot</strong>, a bit dull but entirely necessary to pilot the set&#39;s titular vehicle. As always, Lego has made subtle updates in the eleventh edition of the figure, with this one&#39;s distinguishing feature being a silver streak on the top of the helmet. Otherwise this figure is solid as always, with a well done helmet mold, stellar printing for&nbsp;the hoses on the chest,&nbsp;and leg printing depicting the folds in the flight suit.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<h3>Completed Model</h3>

<p><font color=""#222222"" face=""Times New Roman, serif""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">As I&#39;ve touched on above, this is easily the most aesthetically pleasing minifigure&nbsp;scale TIE fighter Lego has yet created, with the spherical shape of the cockpit being particularly impressive considering that it was created entirely with pieces bearing sharp edges. The only minor design flaw would be the lack of interior wing braces, which are omitted in favor of plates in questionable dark&nbsp;gray hue. The wings themselves are attached with remarkable security, with the clips&#39; attachment to trapdoor pieces insuring that wobbling is nonexistent even in the midst of the most vigorous play.&nbsp;In terms of play features, both the marvelous trans black&nbsp;viewport&nbsp;and the top hatch open, allowing you to place your expendable pilot inside. Though he does not attach to any studs he is held in place quite securely by a droid body with a clip attached, which presumably represents a flight yoke. The other play feature of note is of course the spring loaded shooters&nbsp;found beneath the cockpit, which are launched by pressing on their tails located under the three concentric dishes that compose the vessel&#39;s&nbsp;back. Again, I&#39;d like to emphasize that what this set lacks in play features in more than makes up for in sheer design.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p><font color=""#222222"" face=""Times New Roman, serif""><span style=""background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"">In conclusion, this set is a must purchase for fans of both the Original Trilogy and Solo: A Star Wars Story, even if you happen to own previous incarnations of the model.&nbsp;When comparing this to its ancestor from 2001, it seems clear that no other Star Wars vehicle has seen a more dramatic improvement from its original model to its modern version. While it&#39;s true that 519 pieces for $69.99 is a bit off-putting, that is the price point for TIE Fighters nowadays, and I would presume that like its predecessors 75211&nbsp;will eventually sit for a decent period at 20% off for those who exercise restraint. Even if you break and purchase the set at full though, I think you&#39;ll find 75211 Imperial TIE Fighter well worth it.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

"DutchFlyer","2019-08-03T11:34:28.183Z","Expensive (best?) version of a Star Wars classic","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The TIE-fighter in its various guises is arguably the most (in)famous &#39;vehicle&#39; of the bad guys in the Star Wars series, and the &#39;natural&#39; opponent of the famous X-Wing. As such, Lego has produced over 20 sets of the iconic TIE-fighter and its derivatives over the past 20 years.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Set 75211 Imperial TIE Fighter</strong> was first released in 2018 and seems to have been retired this summer (2019). At first glance it looks much like a grey&nbsp;monochrome version of <strong>set 75101 First Order Special Forces TIE Fighter</strong>, released in 2015. So why get this set when I already have the First Order TIE fighter?</p>

<p>First of all, I felt that a &#39;traditional&#39; TIE fighter should not be missing from my own Lego Star Wars collection, so when I saw one on sale, I got one. Second, when building it, the differences with the First Order TIE fighter were bigger than I thought, though somewhat subtle and in the details. The build was nice, with limited repetitiveness. The result is of decent size,&nbsp;and actually handles well. The big issue, IMHO is its price. I cannot justify the 70 euros RRP in any way. At 20% off this becomes an OK buy, IMHO.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build itself is far from difficult, why the age range is set at 9+ is beyond my understanding. I did find the build enjoyable, and good use is made of the newer pieces (like the 2x2 pointy&nbsp;modified tiles. On the other hand, I do not understand why the panels were not a 2x build, rather than the sequential build they are now. A waste of paper for the manual, IMHO. Again, the similarities with the First Order Tie Fighter are clearly there: the use of a Technic beam for the core of the connection between the two panels, the construction of the two panels themselves as well as the way they are attached. Overall, it probably took me about an hour to build the TIE Fighter.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>All four minifigures so far seem to be unique to this set, which is a nice little surprise. Overall, I consider them well done.</p>

<p>The <strong>Imperial Pilot</strong> is very nicely detailed, with a nice print on the torso and legs. I like the helmet print. His face is an angry clone.</p>

<p>The other angry clone is the <strong>Mimban Stormtrooper</strong>, who IMHO is the best figure in this set. I truly like the print on the torso and legs. Very detailed, as well as subtle, with a mixture of camouflage and mud splatter. If the camouflage print had been continued on the back of the helmet it would have been brilliant.</p>

<p><strong>Tobias Beckett</strong>, as Imperial Mudtrooper is IMHO OK. I am not a fan of his face print. The print of his torso is well done ahd very detailed, nicely depicting the trench coat. What IMHO is rather absent on said coat is&nbsp;mud, especially since there seems to be some on the shirt/body armour he is wearing underneath his coat!</p>

<p>Something similar goes for <strong>Han Solo</strong>. His body armour seems to have mud on it, while the rest of his uniform seems to be free of mud. Generally the print on his torso and legs is well done and nicely detailed. The goggles on his combat helmet are also well done. I like the cape. His two face prints shows a determined smirk, and him yelling.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Well, the TIE Fighter definitely looks like a TIE fighter. The colour, the general shape, the panels, everything. Also, the construction is sturdy, the connection between the panels and the body of the craft is solid. It also compares well in size with the likes of the X-Wing, Y-wing and A-wing. In a dogfight it would not look out of scale at all. The spring-loaded shooters are nicely integrated. Whatever off-colour core pieces are used are nicely covered up and completely invisible. Similarly, there are no clear annoying gaps where the panels connect to the fuselage.Overall, I have a hard time seeing how - in this scale - there could be a massive improvement in its looks.</p>

<p>What the designer has cleverly done, IMHO, is taken the many good elements of the First Order Special Forces TIE Fighter, and copied, adapted and even improved them to fit this Imperial TIE fighter (as an example, I think the connection between the fuselage and panels is an improvement over its First Order cousin). He also made good use of new parts. At the same time, the two builds are different enough to not make one feel as if one builds basically the same set twice.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>To me, this set is as much a play as a display set. It is big enough and looks good enough to be shown as a display piece. At the same time, it is clearly designed for play and works well as such. It is extremely swooshable, and handles well. The panels are fixed solidly to the fuselage and do not come off easily. As a whole, the TIE fighter is very sturdy. The shooters are easy to operate, but one should be able to avoid launching the bolts by accident. The TIE fighter is also not too big in size or too heavy for a child to handle. I can easily see kids enacting a dogfight, or have the TIE Fighter coming in on a bombing run.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall - and ignoring the RRP&nbsp;for the moment - I think this is a good to very good set. It is a fun build, looks the part, has nice minifigures, and works well as both a play set and a display piece. I also think the designer has done a great job in making this set something more than a &#39;copy - paste - recolour&#39; of the 2015 First Order TIE Fighter.</p>

<p>The big issue I have with this set though, is the price. I simply cannot justify 70 euros for this set, not even with the four unique minifigures. IMHO it is about 15 euros overpriced, at a minimum. The many very good features are what prevents this set dropping below a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"lego_collector_123","2020-08-04T10:07:26.653Z","Great TIE","<p>Lego has released a handful of TIE fighters over the years and this is the best minifig scale one to date. This set is based on &ldquo;Solo a Star Wars Story&rdquo; but the starfighter is the same design as in the original trilogy. I&#39;ve always been particularly fond of the TIE&rsquo;s design &ldquo;in universe&rdquo; and this model captures the look well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
<strong>The Minifigures&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Han Solo: Han looks fantastic wearing Mimban armour in this set. His helmet looks great, resembling General Veers helmet from Hoth, but with a new, more detailed mould and printed goggles. His dual expressions are good, one is a slight smile and the other is an angry shout. I love the new cloth piece used for his cloak; it has a jagged edge and a print showing the folds. The torso and legs have amazing detail. The base colour is dark grey and it has muddy armour printed in black and greenish grey. He carries a blaster rifle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tobias Beckett: Beckett is another very well detailed figure. He wears a grey Imperial cap with a silver symbol. The design of the cap prevents him having two expressions, but the one he does have suits the character perfectly. His torso and legs look great and are very similar to Han&rsquo;s but with a trench coat over the armour. He has dual silver blaster pistols, which look awesome.</p>

<p>Mimban stormtrooper: All the minifigures in this set are great including this Mimban stormtrooper. This figure&rsquo;s armour is primarily light grey in contrast to Han and Beckett&rsquo;s dark grey suits. The helmet has a slightly different mould to a standard stormtrooper, with an elevated visor. It&rsquo;s covered with dark grey and tan mud to good effect. He has the standard angry clone face print. He also wears the same cloak piece as Han. While I don&rsquo;t like the torso and leg print quite as much as Han and Beckett&rsquo;s, it still looks great with mud splattered armour. He carries a standard blaster.</p>

<p>TIE pilot: While this is definitely the least interesting figure in the set, he still has great detail. The figure has the normal TIE pilot helmet but with an exclusive print. The print includes a silver stripe running down the middle, detail around the eyes and mouth, and two Imperial symbols on the forehead. He too, has the angry clone face print. Neither the torso nor the legs are exclusive&nbsp;but they accurately depict the flight suit worn by the pilot. He holds a blaster pistol.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Set&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I love the design of TIE fighters &ldquo;in universe&rdquo; and this one looks great. It has the standard colour scheme of a light grey fuselage with dark grey highlights and black wings with light grey crossbeams. The model is very swooshable, with an easy grip and good stability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fuselage looks good. It has a printed hatch and canopy which open to allow access to the cockpit. There is space in the cockpit for the pilot, and two clips store blasters which is useful storage. A droid body is used as a flight yoke to nice effect. The exterior surface is well greebled and I especially like the ingot, and kite shaped shield pieces. The back of the model uses radar dishes to form the smooth curve and has two transparent red lights representing the Twin Ion Engine that give the TIE its name. The ship has two spring-loaded shooters integrated into the body nicely that can be fired off from the back. The underside of the ship is a bit blocky unfortunately but you don&rsquo;t see it too often.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wings are securely attached to the body using ratcheted joints that lock in place. They look especially great from the outside. Each wing has the customary hexagonal shape and has support beams radiating out from the centre. The centre of each wing also has a printed tile and roller-skate pieces used for greebling. &ldquo;In universe&rdquo; the model should have the beams on the inside as well. Unfortunately this model doesn&rsquo;t as they would have been difficult to add but the effect still works well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a fantastic set. It looks very movie accurate, except the lack of inside crossbeams. It plays well due to the inclusion of spring loaded shooters and it&rsquo;s swooshability. Plus all four of the fantastic figures are exclusive. $100 is average for a medium-sized starfighter and I definitely recommend this set.&nbsp;<br />
