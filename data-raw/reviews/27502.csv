"Keautay","2018-04-26T15:20:47.717Z","Great once finished, lack in building satisfaction.","<p>Note that it is my first Falcon, but I saw the 2015 Force Awakens version built at my brother&rsquo;s house, from which most building techniques are borrowed. It&rsquo;s a cleaner white version, with some differences, notably the long nose (in fact a cargo shuttle, I think) and the interior.</p>

<p>OVERALL<br />
It&rsquo;s a set of compromises. It&rsquo;s clear the designers had to make choices in order to keep the price down. A cool set for display and collectors.</p>

<p>LOOK AND FEEL<br />
I really like the exterior design. It&rsquo;s great to have an old ship this clean. I was concerned about the gaps between the triangular plates and sides before building it, but it&rsquo;s really not a problem after all, in my opinion; as long as you don&rsquo;t add lighting in the ship. The turrets are a bit too simple. Those on the 2015 versions are better, but I guess it&rsquo;s one of the many modifications Han made to the ship. The antenna can be moved around. The mix of blue, white and grey is great (considering SW ships are 90% grey most of the time).</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:12.0pt"">The build is very sturdy for a vehicle this size. I wouldn&rsquo;t drop it though as it would collapse under it&rsquo;s weight. Yes, it&rsquo;s heavy. Maybe that&rsquo;s why the legs are not retractable: it&rsquo;s unlikely you&rsquo;ll want to fly it around.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:12.0pt"">The interior design is ish. Some modules are cool, but it mostly feels empty. I like the bed, bar, seating and control modules, but the rear is almost completely stripped of engine components that were in the 2015 version. The space near the cockpit is unusable, and there is room for added finishing on the inside of the exterior walls, but they didn&rsquo;t use it. I&rsquo;m sure Lego decided not to finish the interior in under to keep the price &ldquo;low&rdquo;, as it&rsquo;s more of an exterior display model than one you&rsquo;ll leave open.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:12.0pt"">There isn&rsquo;t too many stickers. Most are round, so easier to apply in my opinion.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:12.0pt"">BUILDING<br />
Building experience was boring the first half, but got better when you can see the finished product coming to life. I&rsquo;m used to modular sets where you have many little things to build, so it&rsquo;s satisfying from page 1. You have to be patient with the Falcon, as there&rsquo;s nothing exciting before you start the exterior. I have to give credit for the techniques used to have the&nbsp;round shape of the ship, and for the angled &#39;passage&#39; to the cockpit.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:12.0pt"">With the modular sets, I&rsquo;m also used to have 4 to 6 bag numbers with around 500 parts each. It&rsquo;s balanced between not-searching-an-hour-for-each-part and keeping-a-bit-of-challenge. The Falcon had 10 bag numbers of around 150 part each. I&rsquo;m not sure why they did that, it&rsquo;s no fun. I didn&rsquo;t spend one second searching for anything. I recommend opening a bunch of them if you like having to search a bit.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:12.0pt"">The parts are mostly common. A LOT of plates. Great printed cockpit parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:12.0pt"">CHARACTERS<br />
The characters are great even if we don&rsquo;t know them yet. I already had Han and Qi&rsquo;ra from Han&rsquo;s Landspeeder. Surprisingly, Qi&rsquo;ra hair are very different: longer, lighter brown (and soft plastic instead of hard plastic). I guess she&rsquo;s some kind of spy adapting her look to the situation? The Alien is very cool, except the back of its head. Both robots are nice and unique. It&rsquo;s my first Chewbacca minifig His face looks a bit weird, maybe because it&rsquo;s a younger version. He doesn&rsquo;t have his crossbow, but a rifle. Lando is the greatest: the cape, the details, his expression and hair. Even his gun is different (heavy pistol with silver finish instead of black).</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:12.0pt""><img alt=""Qi'ra"" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/976/41676762042_98f1ae17a4_k.jpg"" style=""width: 192px; height: 300px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/979/41676758212_d734295e82_k.jpg"" style=""width: 184px; height: 300px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/828/40999152884_3bae6992bb_k.jpg"" style=""width: 181px; height: 300px;"" /><br />

<p style=""margin-bottom:12.0pt"">PLAYABILITY<br />
As I said, you&rsquo;re not gonna fly this huge and heavy ship around. I&rsquo;m not sure where you&rsquo;re supposed to grasp it anyway. There are cool features though: turret seats (as you can see on the back of the box), removable nose, ramp, bar, bed, seating, &lsquo;coffee&rsquo; machine in the cockpit (a Lando thing I&rsquo;m sure).</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:12.0pt"">You can fit two characters in the cockpit, but I had a hard time putting the window back in place with Chewy sitting there.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:12.0pt"">Concerning the nose. I first thought it was a cargo area, but it&rsquo;s more a cargo shuttle. There is a control panel inside, big reactors at the rear, and small ones on the side for navigation.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:12.0pt""><img alt="""" src=""https://farm1.staticflickr.com/949/41676761542_7413023d6e_k.jpg"" style=""width: 688px; height: 500px;"" /></p>

<p>VALUE</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s overpriced for the part count. But there is a lot of medium and large parts: plates, 2x2 and 2x6 bricks, slopes, etc. If you compare the weight, 2361g, it&rsquo;s only 300g less than the Parisian Restaurant, which has an extra 1000 parts. So plastic material wise, it&rsquo;s not that much overpriced.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a cool set to have, but there are many others I would recommend buying before this one. The exterior design, functionalities and characters are great, but the overall building experience leaves a bit of a bad taste for a set in this price range.</p>

"Kris_PL","2018-05-29T17:07:29.98Z","The playset of the movie (Spoilers!)","<p>Solo: A Star Wars Story is in cinemas right now and we can all enjoy it, while paying extra attention at how accurate it&#39;s Lego sets were with the movie. I was particularly pleased to see the extra care LEGO put into the Han solo speeder, which i think the Dutch toymaker went above and beyond for. However, the most important set in the Solo line was of course, the Millennium Falcon. The beloved ship got the most screen time of all vehicles, therefore it is important to take a closer look at the flagship set.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>First, i was pleasantly surprised with the origins of the minifigure selection. As it turns out the two unknown droids are taking part in the Kessel uprising caused by L3-37. The droids sport some remarkable details and i am pleased that, they have been included in the set. However, L3-37 is missing from the line-up and i think it would complete the set perfectly. I hope she will be included in the next wave. Those 2 droids need someone to follow!<br />
Han Solo, Q&#39;ira, Chewbacca and Lando look remarkable. However there is a bit of an inconsistency. Lando&#39;s recreation in lego form is extremely accurate while Q&#39;ira looks a bit plain. Maybe the cape (visible in the trailer) would make the figure more attractive.</p>

<p>The completed model</p>

<p>The Millennium Falcon follows its predecessor closely in terms of build. Different, white and blue, color scheme looks remarkable. I am glad Lego chose to make it this color as it is very movie accurate. The front of the ship, which features the mandibles and escape pod, look somehow off. The mandibles are shorter than the 2015 version, plus the escape pod has very little to do in the movie. However it has a great play potential, since you can put a minifig and cargo inside. Unfortunately the interior is pretty disappointing. The 2015 version of the ship had more details on the inside, while the Lando version feels empty. We do get a bar and bed visible in movie for about 2 seconds, but i would love something more being done with the space. Lando&#39;s cape room for example. On the plus side i do enjoy the espresso machine in the cockpit area. While it is not movie accurate, i different idea to accommodate this less attractive space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model sports the same functions as its predecessor and that&#39;s also a small minus. Very small one thought. Seeing the movie, i would love some functions which would help falcon to, well, fall apart. In one of the most iconic scenes, Falcon gets almost wrecked by the Kessel run. It would be nice to see a connection with that part of the movie. Although, i understand that Lego couldn&#39;t;t have seen the whole film and it just got the information necessary to make a good recreation of the ship.</p>

<p>Final thoughts</p>

<p>Despite the flaws i mentioned below, this is the ultimate set of the movie. It features very attractive minifigure line-up which will help to recreate some vital scenes of the movie. The ship, while not perfect, looks good and has a lot of playability. I am sure that kids will find it very fun to play around. As an AFOL and owner of the 2015 version, it isn&#39;t exactly what i wanted. There is also an issue of price, although complaining about it seems to be regular nowadays. In conclusion, Lego excelled with the minifigures, which i am proud to add to my collection. However, the hefty price doesn&#39;t justify the little changes made to the falcon overall.</p>

"DKside41","2018-06-25T13:46:59.93Z","Kessel Run Milenium Falcon ","<p>Overall, I feel this is a very nice set. The color scheme is nice, a very good selection of minifigures (admittedly with some odd choices) and a very fun building experience. The gaps between the panels are more unsightly than the past few falcon, and the price is a little steep for what is really just a slightly modified version of the Force Awakens version. Other than the price, I think this set is pretty great.</p>
",TRUE,4,4,5,4,3
"alfred_the_buttler","2019-02-21T05:05:18.44Z","Definitely not your standard Millennium Falcon ","<p>So I already have 7965 which is the Falcon based on the original movie and I didn&rsquo;t have any plans on buying another Falcon. I did make some modifications&nbsp;to 7965 to incorporate some of the improvements that I thought made a big difference in 75105, which meant there was really no reason to get a 75105 (I just got Rey, Finn, and BB-8 minifigures&nbsp;that could go inside). I also had no intentions of purchasing this set 75212, but then my wife surprised me by getting it for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set of course is very similar to 7965, but there are some major differences, and those differences are big enough to make it a very worthwhile set to own even if you already have one of the older models.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Similarities&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>There of course are many similarities, it is basically built the same exact way as the previous models. Same methods, same repetition, and even some of the same shortcomings. Those shortcomings include&nbsp;non-retractable landing gear, a short entry ramp, and an unadorned interior to the outer walls (which I think is amplified because it is white). If you are looking for a completely unique build, don&rsquo;t expect it from this set. This is a major drawback if you already own a Falcon.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Differences&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Despite the similarities, there are still many differences, some are good and some are bad.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Changes for the Worse</b></p>

<p>Some features have been removed, most notably the smuggling compartment in the floor, I really think that this feature should have remained, especially considering how simple it is to create. Another removal is that their is only one hyperdrive, not two. I feel as if losing that symmetry really detracts from the interior.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However the biggest problem is that it lost flexibility and openness. The back central roof panel is no longer operable, as a result the rear of the ship is divided into two quarters, I had previously enjoyed the openness of the back, it gave you a huge area to play in and made it quite easy to set up scenes, as well as house extra minifigures.</p>

<p>Another problem lies under the front central panel. There are now two arches crossing the interior, effectively dividing the front in half as well, and making the quarter attached to the cockpit pretty much unusable. This may even be a larger problem than the back since you now lose an entire quarter of the ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Improvements&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>While they may have destroyed the interior under the front central panel, they did improve the panel itself. In 7965 it was attached to a single hinge and fell off easily and a limited range of motion. It now operates on a double technic hinge (just like 75105), giving it a much wider range of motion and making it immensely stronger. The only issue is if the escape pod is attached you lose a lot of its range and it is a considerably more difficult to access the front of the ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another huge improvement is you now have a hatch to access the guns in the center of the ship, no more having to remove the top, it is now on a hinge which seems so simple but yet was missing from 7965 (this was corrected in 75105). The guns have also changed from 4 smaller ones to one larger one. This of course is accurate to the new movie, but more importantly, it is much more securely attached.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The seating area around the chess table still uses those old fashioned seats that I dislike. This is actually something that I upgraded on my 7965 by building the seats from 75105. However, I must say that the yellow seats look much better than the brown seats, and I do like how they are made into a sectional. Could brick built seats using some fancy SNOT technique have looked better? Of course, but It would not be worth having to pay for 100 more bricks? Probably not.&nbsp;Overall it looks good and is true to Lando&#39;s style.&nbsp; The main computer also got moved to the side due to the arches in the front and has another chair, allowing a total of 5 minifigures to sit around the chess table! Plus you get the better looking chess board from 75105.</p>

<p>The cockpit assembly is also a major improvement over 7965 in that it is not connected with technic pins. That connection on 7965 makes the entire cockpit a little wobbly, where this one is just connected through normal brick stacking and as a result is completely rigid (this had been fixed on 75105). The back of the cockpit isn&#39;t as beautiful as 7965 but is definitely superior to 75105. It contains a coffee maker, although I&#39;m guessing it actually makes some other type of drink as I doubt they have coffee in far away galaxies. Beside that, it hasn&#39;t changed much.</p>

<p>Another big plus are the mandibles in the front. I see people are complaining that they are smaller, but I really don&#39;t see that as a major problem, they look perfectly fine to me at this size, and any larger would have made the ship too large. But where they are improved is that they now include spring loaded missiles which were not available on 7965 (they were on 75105). The sides of them are completely finished which gives the ship a much better look, previously the sides had a very jagged unfinished look to them.</p>

<p>Finally, these may be minor but still worth mentioning. The radar dish is a huge improvement as it is hinged on two ball sockets giving you an incredible range of motion and a lot more durability. The blue tube in the back representing the fire has a very sleek connection to the ship that actually looks good!</p>

<p><b>Now the Major Changes</b></p>

<p>Obviously the minifigures are completely different from any other Falcon. Han is young, Chewie is different than previous ones which you probably already have a bunch of, and Lando (who I never had before) of course is a younger version. The rest of the minifigures are completely new and quite honestly, you will never be able to get any of them anywhere else, probably ever again. Maybe they aren&#39;t as cool as Luke and Leia, but you will definitely have many more chances to get the standard characters if you don&#39;t already have them. So I consider these minifigures a major plus. My only complaint is it contains two obscure droids and not L3-37 who has a major role in the movie and is a very unique looking droid. It also does not contain Beckett, another major oversight and a crucial character in this part of the storyline.</p>

<p>Next up is the front of the ship, you now have the escape pod. While the pod didn&#39;t play a huge role in the movie, simply being used for bait, it does give you another ship to play with and while attached gives you a completely different look to the standard Falcon. The ship is fairly simple, the top opens in much the same way as the front center panel on the main ship, and other than a computer panel and some coaxium, it is pretty much wide open so can hold quite a few minifigures. Quite honestly, this is what really sets this Falcon apart from previous ones.</p>

<p>Gone are the simple beds from the previous models, I never saw beds in those movies anyways, they have been replaced by Lando&#39;s&nbsp;bed and a kitchen.&nbsp; Clearly including the actual bed is much better, and the kitchen does offer a lot more play possibilities.&nbsp; I would have liked to see Lando&#39;s&nbsp;closet filled with capes, it would have been a lot of fun if you had several capes to select from, but I suppose the main issue is there really isn&#39;t a place to put it, maybe I&#39;ll figure out some sort of modification to include it.</p>

<p>Finally there is the color, a white Falcon gives you a completely new look, probably the only time you will ever see white in Star Wars outside of Hoth. Even more unique is the bright blue detailing. Quite honestly, the ship looks great and completely different from the other Falcons.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>The set unfortunately still relies entirely on stickers for detailing, which I really don&#39;t understand given its price tag and the fact that many of the sticker designs are identical to 7965 ans 75105 meaning they could have been printing these bricks for a decade! The price tag is also pretty outrageous. Yes, it does have a larger brick count than the previous two thanks to the escape pod, but quite honestly, they are all a little overpriced.</p>

<p>While I do have a few complaints about some deprovements, the biggest being how inaccessible much of the interior is, I do feel like it keeps all the improvements from 75105 while also further perfecting the design of the ship.</p>

<p>While I wouldn&#39;t recommend this as your only Falcon, I&#39;d prefer the classic look if I were to only own one, I do recommend it as a second Falcon as it really is unique and does not look like you own the same set twice. I also assume that we will probably never see sets based on the Solo movie again as it was a flop, so if you want to own one set from that movie, this one certainly is a very logical choice as it contains most of the major characters and you can argue that this ship shares a leading role alongside Han and Chewie.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a review of set 75212: Kessel Run Millennium Falcon.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Seven figures are included in this set, all of which are exclusive.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Han Solo</strong> appears in his brown jacket which he wears most of the time in the movie. He looks good. A little rough around the edges, but good. This is somewhat of a plain figure compared to the one included in 75209 Han Solo&#39;s Landspeeder, mainly because of the brown used for his hair and torso. However, I still like this figure quite a bit and it is pretty accurate. He includes a black mini blaster for his accessory. I hate to say it, but unfortunately <strong>Qi&#39;Ra </strong>is one of the worst figures in this wave of sets. I don&#39;t like the open jacket, mainly because in the movie&nbsp;it sticks out so much when it&#39;s open, something you just can&#39;t capture without using an actual cloth piece. Also,&nbsp;it should be beige&nbsp;instead of tan. (LEGO really needs to add beige to their color palliate!)&nbsp;As stated in my last review, I like her sad expression but the happy one just doesn&#39;t look much&nbsp;like&nbsp;Emilia Clarke to me. She reuses a friends style hair piece which is also not entirely accurate, but I guess it&#39;s not quite&nbsp;bad enough to create a new mold. Also, her belt should be tilted off to one side. LEGO clearly made it straight so they wouldn&#39;t have to put print on the hip piece. The lack of any printing on the legs, not even any crease marks, also retracts from the figure. She includes a black mini blaster. <strong>Chewbacca</strong>, to my surprise, uses a brand new mold for the upper part which is done in all dark brown. It would have been nice if they had dual molded it so the bandolier would not be the same color as his fur. I like the printing, but the face looks a little creepy. He reuses the same leg print is the regular Chewy. He also includes a large blaster gun. <strong>Lando Calrissian</strong> stands out as one of the better figures in this wave. I love the torso and leg prints. I think his face does an excellent job of capturing two common Donald Glover&nbsp;expressions. I love his new cape piece which is printed on one side. His hair is not that great though. He just reuses Nakia&#39;s hair from the Black Panther Royale Talon Fighter set, which looks okay, but isn&#39;t quite the right shape. He also includes a flat silver blaster, which is somewhat rare. <strong>Quay Tolsite</strong>, the sinister&nbsp;administer of the Pyke Syndicate&#39;s operations on Kessel, is also a pretty good figure, although he didn&#39;t get too much action in the movie. He uses the new dress piece, with printing on the front and back, which is something we never got when LEGO used the 1 x 3 x 2 slope pieces for dresses. He also uses a brand new helmet mold, which also looks pretty good but the face should be so far in it. The print on the face looks pretty good, but for some reason&nbsp;I almost get a feminine vibe from it. I like the print on the torso as well. He comes with a mini blaster.&nbsp;<strong>DD-BD</strong>, a droid enslaved by Quay Tolsite, got pretty decent screen time when he was seen&nbsp;being freed by L3-37 (droid rights!). The printing is pretty good, but he is way too tall. He should be about half the size of a normal figure. The bottom part should be shaped like the head, but that&#39;s not really possible to do using that same part (it would have to have a hole going through it for the legs to stick in). I would have honestly rather&nbsp;they had included&nbsp;a helmeted Kessel Mine Worker or Kessel Guard instead. The last figure in this set is&nbsp;labeled as&nbsp;<strong>Kessel Operations Droid</strong>, who was<strong> a</strong>lso enslaved. He got about 0.5 seconds of screen time, only seen running with the other slaves when set free. Despite this, I think this is still a fantastic figure. He has very good printing on the legs, torso, and front and back of the head. Once again, this is a good addition to my collection, but I think another character with more screen time would have made more sense. I think this set should have came with at least one more figure. I am extremely disappointed by the absence of L3-37, because it looks like we may never get one. Overall, an okay selection of figures, but I think Qi&#39;Ra could have been done a lot better and the could have switched the two droids out for something else.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Right away, I will tell you that the build for this is extremely similar to the 2015 TFA&nbsp;Millennium Falcon, the main differences being the colors and the escape pod attached to the front. The landing gear are once again unretractable, but they are closer to the edges than the 2015 one. The most noticeable&nbsp;feature of the entire ship is the front part, therefore, you would expect it to be very accurate. However, it is WAY too small!&nbsp;With the escape pod attached, it should be about as long as the main body of the ship!&nbsp;The escape pod, which was surprisingly released into a gravity vortex as bait for the space kraken, can simply be pulled off. With it removed, you can see some engine details on the sides and back. The top part can be hinged forward to reveal the interior. All that is in there is a stickered console and a vile of Coaxium. The interior was never seen in the movie. With it removed,&nbsp;you are left with&nbsp;the two&nbsp;front parts, which&nbsp;is the look most people are familiar with.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have no idea why, but LEGO decided to make the front parts SHORTER on this one than the 2015 one, making them look extremely stubby and inaccurate, especially when looked at beside the 2015 one. With the escape pod attached, it looks much better, but still bad. There is also a spring loaded shooter on each side which are integrated in nicely and can be triggered by pressing on a clip piece, which doesn&#39;t retract a bit from the look. I just wish the entire front section was bigger, because it being small ruins the entire set for me. Had it been the right size, I may would have given this set&nbsp;4 stars instead of 3. The main body for the ship looks pretty good despite all of the gaps. I know a lot of people hate this set just for that reason but it doesn&#39;t bother me much. Like the 2015 one, all of the flaps can be hinged to get access to the interior. Unlike the 2015 one, the back cannot be hinged open. Instead, it is attached to the middle, thus giving it much more stability and making it possible to hold it from the back alone. The left side has the Dejarik table, which is a reused print. The yellow bench looks fine. It is actually made up of four yellow&nbsp;chair pieces and a stickered part (I&#39;m not sure if this is a seat or not), therefore it can seat up to&nbsp;5 figures.&nbsp;In the middle of the left side,&nbsp;there is a computer with two stickered parts, both of which are actually based on stuff we see in the movie, as well as a black chair.&nbsp;In the&nbsp;other room there is a bar, which is okay but very plain. But hey, at least we get one at all. There is also a bed which is also very plain and lazy. They could have easily made it a lot better by designing it like the (currently) yet to be released Hoth Medical Chamber set. On top of that, you can&#39;t even fit figures with large helmet or hair pieces such as Qi&#39;Ra in it. It would be nice to fit two figures side by side, but that would make the bed be way too big.The bed&nbsp;is very disappointing to me personally. Anyway, enough talk about the bed. Moving on to the other side, there is half of the hyperdrive at the back. I think this was a good decision because there is a wall separating the two sides. It looks okay but doesn&#39;t do anything. There is also a cargo area with two dark bluish gray crates, one containing a white pair of electrobionoculars and the other containing a vile of Coaxium. It would have been nice to have gotten an actual storage compartment with more Coaxium, but it&#39;s fine. I love the stickers that say &quot;CARGO&quot; in Arebesh, that&#39;s a really nice touch. In the middle, there is a loading ramp which can be hinged down.&nbsp;The very front has two arches but they are too low for a minifig to walk under. There are a couple clips in between them to hold onto the spare spring loaded shooter bolts.&nbsp;In the middle of the ship gun that can be rotated and hinged. There is also a little assembly that can be pulled out. You can place two minifigs back to back. There are controls for each of them. When placed back in, one is facing up and one is facing down for them to operate the two guns on the Millennium Falcon. This is one of the greatest improvements on the 2015 one, as this feels so much more complete. The 2015 one basically just had a plate to stick figures on. There is also a gun on the bottom and a radar dish on to which can be retracted against the ship. The cockpit is also a great improvement over the 2015 one. On this one, the gaps are filled in. There is still only room for two minifigs and it has a stickered console and a lever. There is also some sort of coffee maker(?) in the back, which I don&#39;t even remember seeing in the movie. There is a brand new printed piece used for the cockpit. Same print as the 2015 one but in white. Unfortunately, the&nbsp;print appears slightly&nbsp;translucent.The exterior of the ship is pretty well detailed overall. The back uses the same technique for the exhaust, but I think the tube is done in trans-light blue instead of trans-blue. I also want to note that several stickers are included, the ones on the six round technic parts being extremely hard to apply perfectly.</p>

<p>So overall... could have been better. Although there are several improvements over the 2015 one, there are also several downgrades. The figures are okay for the price, but not great. Speaking of the price, this is about $30 overpriced. Even with all of the large parts included, I just don&#39;t see why it&#39;s so much. I would have liked for the interior to be a little more detailed as well as the front being a lot bigger. It would have also been cool if the had included some sort of Kessel Mine entrance or something to that extent. Luckily you can find it on eBay for $150, which is about what it&#39;s worth. I would recommend this set only to major Star Wars fans or completionists. If you want some Solo sets, you can literally get all the other sets in this wave for less money. Not a terrible set, just not a great set.</p>

"calzonie","2022-10-03T20:28:35.28Z","A Decent Millennium Falcon for Solo Fans, but Already Outdated","<p>I bought this set about a month ago, and in that time I&#39;ve gone back and forth on it a lot. It has some annoying problems that are difficult to look past, but it&#39;s not without merit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Starting with the figures, they&#39;re great!&nbsp;Lando is easily the star of the show here, with his bright-colored outfit and (printed!) collared cape. Han also looks great, as does the golden-headed Pike. The Solo version of Chewbacca&nbsp;seems to be controversial due to his unique mold.&nbsp;Some fans find it ugly, but I actually like it. It&#39;s a more unkempt look, which makes sense given his situation when the movie starts. Qi&#39;ra is... okay. Definitely not bad, but she feels like a rushed job compared to the other figures. She&#39;s the only one to not feature any leg printing, and while her rubbery Friends hairpiece is interesting, it&#39;s not a great match for the character in the movie. The droids are good enough, but&nbsp;they feel like filler to beef up the minifig count. It would have made more sense to include&nbsp;L3, Lando&#39;s co-pilot/far more important character than either of these droids.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Moving onto the build, it was a mostly enjoyable process, but the finished set doesn&#39;t hold up well to scrutiny, either visually or for play.</p>

<p>I love the colors, that was one of the main reasons I chose it over 75257, the Episode IX version (which, as of writing this review, is still available in stores). The white and blue are striking, and they help it stand out from the typical Star Wars fare of mostly gray masses. A lot of the interior decorations are also fun. The bed has a sleek design, the Holo-Chess area has more seats than any other Falcon (five&nbsp;total), and the escape pod adds a little extra space. The pod&#39;s play function also works really well. It&#39;s easy to remove and put back in, but the connection is tight enough that it&#39;s not going to fall out accidentally, or break off if you put a hand under it when you pick up the set.</p>

<p>On the downside, the white exterior paired&nbsp;with black floors inside make&nbsp;all the gaps along the top that much more obvious. The way the exterior is built&nbsp;seems to be almost identical to the Episode VII Falcon, which makes its missteps feel&nbsp;forgivable as a&nbsp;product of its time. That is,&nbsp;until you remember that this model released just one&nbsp;year before 75257, which made a lot of progress with fixing design issues like those gaps (it also brings back the removable floorboard for smuggling, something the Solo version is weirdly missing). It makes this model almost instantly dated, and not in a charming way like a lot of classic sets.</p>

<p>The set could have been more egregious with its use of stickers, but I can&#39;t for the life of me determine why the six vents&nbsp;on top continue to be stickers. I don&#39;t think any of the last several Falcons have used a different design, so they really should be printing those by now.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Play value is where this set gets really messy, though. As I said before, the escape pod works great, and I can always appreciate when the spring-loaded shooters are this well hidden,&nbsp;but that&#39;s about the end of my compliments in the play feature&nbsp;department. Here are my complaints in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The walls of the Falcon are just too short, so having characters in a few of&nbsp;the Holo-Chess seats, for example, doesn&#39;t let you close the roof all the way. And it&#39;s not close either, it sticks up quite a bit.&nbsp;With the interior space already being cramped, these low walls really limit your options if you want to store your figures inside the ship.</li>
	<li>About a quarter of the&nbsp;main large circle is basically unusable, as that space is taken up by the archway leading to the cockpit.</li>
	<li>The canons on the top and bottom&nbsp;swivel loosely, but that&#39;s a really easy fix if it bothers you.</li>
	<li>The entrance ramp doesn&#39;t go down very far (although this is not a unique problem for this model), and the ceiling above it is not intended to be removed. This makes it pretty difficult to put a figure on that ramp.</li>
	<li>The cockpit is a really tight fit.&nbsp;Whoever you put in there has to lean back as far as possible for the windshield to just barely fit over their heads. I&#39;m not sure why the floor in there couldn&#39;t have been positioned a plate or two lower, this would have made the whole section a lot more convenient to work with.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have plenty of problems with this set, but I can&#39;t convince&nbsp;myself give it a lower overall score than a 3 out of 5. It has what might be my favorite batch of minifigures in any Millennium Falcon set, and there&#39;s a good chance we&#39;ll never see the white and blue, long-nosed Falcon again. I don&#39;t regret buying it, but I&#39;d have a hard time recommending it unless you&#39;re&nbsp;one of the (surprisingly few) people who really liked Solo.</p>
