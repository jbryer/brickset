"miuboy","2018-01-22T13:33:03.48Z","the nether fight is great?","<p>i was wandering around walmart&nbsp;with my little brother when we discovered walmart&nbsp;had half of the wave there, while previously in the last 4 days of 2017 i purchased&nbsp;the nether portal while on new years my brother bought the chicken coop, then i got the zombie cave and now this set was great for many reasons but i will save that for later</p>

<p>MOBS/MINIFIGURES</p>

<p>this set has easy ways to get mobs from bigger&nbsp;set.</p>

<p>ALEX: a standard&nbsp;Alex&nbsp;in half iron armor no helmet but the major reason i purchased this set is the ENCHANTED AXE!!!!!! finally there adding features from 1.9 and 1.12!</p>

<p>WITHERSKELETON&nbsp;: hey this is good to get because of their only being in one set and its the wither.</p>

<p>ZOMBIEPIGMAN: well now in 3 sets and becoming more common i switched the gold sword for a stone so my players have gold sword.</p>

<p>MAGMACUBE: well it is ok to get.... its fine couldn&#39;t&nbsp;add a medium size?</p>

<p>THE BLOCKS/ITEMS</p>

<p>this set doesn&#39;t&nbsp;have many to die for blocks but its ok to get more tnt...</p>

<p>GOLDSWORD: this is good to get but should be have<br />
STONESWORD: SO MANY STONE!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

<p>ENCHANTED AXE... wow they finally did it.... made my day when i saw this. they should of made the enchanted tools marbled&nbsp;so there could be a variety...</p>

<p>THE SET</p>

<p>it is a small little area to play and pose with but there is a TNT action feature where a small 2*4 brick and a lever will cause it to launch, similar&nbsp;to the zombie cave with its but weaker and smaller. it has a removable top area&nbsp;to extend the area</p>

<p>OVERALL</p>

<p>this set is relatively OK not great also not bad, the mobs and items are a awesome to get but lego lost a opportunity&nbsp;to make a medium magmacube, i recommend&nbsp;this if you do not have any nether set but not a starter set.if you do purchase this i hope you have fun and enjoy your set!!!</p>

"PizzaBrick","2019-01-12T00:23:48.553Z","Great Set For Playability!","<p>Lego Minecraft&nbsp;is a theme that pleases fans of the game and video game fans.</p>

<p>They have great sets every year, this is one of them!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The box has traditional Minecraft&nbsp;colours&nbsp;which are green and brown. It is 6-14 which is a good age rating in my opinion. The picture of the set gives a good Impresion!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-</p>

<p>Minifigs&nbsp;lots of people&rsquo;s favourite thing about a set. I can say that the Minifigs&nbsp;in this set are outstanding, but people making a custom nether world will need these Minifigs. The Minifigs are A zombie pigman, Alex, a wither skeleton and a magma cube (Just a Minecraft head piece so you could say it&rsquo;s not a minifig).</p>

<p>The green on the zombie pigman&nbsp;is very nice, the alex&nbsp;minifig&nbsp;is plain but nice to get, the magma cube is call because there not in much sets, and the wither skeleton no doubt would be everyone&rsquo;s favourite&nbsp;because of its tall legs.</p>

<p>The build&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The build seems to be just some terrain or I think it might be part of a nether fortress because of the colours. It has an exploding feature, to activate push down on the smooth lava without studs and a 2x4 brick pops off. The could of made it a 2x6 brick but 2x4 is fine. They have grown mushroom on the terrain, some fire and some soul sand. They have some pouring lava and magma blocks near the lava just like the game does. It has some space underneath the terrrain which I think is a bit big.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>This is a great sets with lots of play value. I think kids will love it. I don&rsquo;t have much complaints except with the big gap underneath the terrain. I hope you like my review more will come since the new 2019 sets are nearly on shelves in Western Australia!</p>
