"Natethegreat101","2018-01-17T20:05:48.343Z","Chickens!","<p>After 4&nbsp;years from its initial launch, LEGO Minecraft&nbsp;has finally introduced one of the original mobs that was found in the game itself. And it couldn&#39;t have been done better!</p>

<p>The build was pretty basic as most Minecraft&nbsp;sets understandably&nbsp;are. The giant chicken, which is being used as a nest for the chickens, was&nbsp;the most satisfying part of the build to me. It&#39;s obvious that the giant chicken is meant to be player made structure and it does a great job of capturing the chicken&#39;s look.</p>

<p>A simple yet clever feature captures the eggs laid within the nest to drop them into the chest hidden behind the legs. This feature is an accurate representation of how a water&nbsp;and hopper system&nbsp;would automatically collect eggs and store them in game.</p>

<p>There are couple parts worth mentioning in this set: (I&#39;ve included the spares into the count)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>four&nbsp;Plate 2x2, w/ Reduced&nbsp;Knobs in light bluish gray</li>
	<li>two eggs</li>
	<li>two feathers in white&nbsp;</li>
	<li>nine&nbsp;1x1 Round Plate w/&nbsp;Through Hole&nbsp;in reddish brown&nbsp;</li>
	<li>two&nbsp;1x2x2 corner plate in the nougat or medium flesh color</li>
</ul>

<p>For Minecraft&nbsp;fans, we get&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>a chicken themed banner</li>
	<li>two round 1x1 clear tiles with seeds&nbsp;print&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The obvious draw of this set are the chickens and the price seems perfect when considering everything you get. You also can&#39;t go wrong with an added bonus of a tamed wolf. I don&#39;t consider getting another Alex a positive though....</p>

"Bricksisko","2019-07-18T05:14:21.313Z","Very Impressed","<p>I am very impressed with this set. When I first saw the pictures, i knew I wanted to get it. I ended up purchasing it at my local Lego store and it did not disappoint. Here is a pro/con list to sum up my thoughts.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>-Good value</p>

<p>-Really nice play feature where you can lay eggs into the chest</p>

<p>-Finally a Lego Minecraft chicken</p>

<p>-A dog with a blue collar</p>

<p>-You get Alex instead of Steve to mix it up</p>

<p>-Amazingly useful egg pieces</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>-It would be unrealistic in the actual Minecraft game</p>

<p>-If this is your only Minecraft set, you won&#39;t get a Steve</p>

<p>-Very little room for the chickens</p>

<p>-The eggs feel a little bit too large compared to the chickens</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, This is a really great set. It was really hard for me to try to find some cons. That is just how good it is. I would recommend this set over any other small&nbsp;Minecraft&nbsp;set released as of July 2019. Hopefully this helped you make a decision about if you should buy this set! Thanks for reading.</p>

<p>The price is absolutely worth it and the building experience was awesome with the Chicken build. The playability is ok with the feature to drop eggs. The parts are good.</p>
