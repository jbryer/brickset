<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>this set has 2 repeated minifigres and a rare one that makes this set to buy</p>

<p>MINIFIGS</p>

<p>STEVE: a normal Steve&nbsp;with a cookie and an iron pickaxe and an iron helmet, BRING BACK WOODEN!!!!!!!</p>

<p>ZOMBIE: a normal vanilla zombie good to get again</p>

<p>BABY ZOMBIE?: YES finally a baby zombie it has the new 2018 minecraft baby figure body and head great it only covers a tile but that good</p>

<p>BAT: hey a bat cool to get one in a cheep set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BLOCKS AND ORES</p>

<p>this set is full of minable blocks</p>

<p>REDSTONE ORE: this only comes with one</p>

<p>GOLD ORE: this should of been iron but oh well</p>

<p>DIAMOND ORE: wow this is the cheapest set to get it&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>STONE: this is a common block in grey</p>

<p>GRAVEL: so thats what the block was in the crafting box! instead&nbsp;of a jumper on top there is a tile</p>

<p>TNT: so another tnt is great</p>

<p>2018 FURNACE: this is a major improvement over the old one with a double prints one on and the other off</p>

<p>THE SET</p>

<p>it is a medium size set with a great play area with the main action feature being falling gravel.</p>

<p>it also has an lava flow</p>

<p>it also has a spot to add the bat on the roof, this set has the most powerful explosion feature... why? there is a button on the far left in the front where you press it and a 2*4 with a jumper and tnt and for me it went flying off and lost it for a few seconds.</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>this set has potential but has some flaws for an example there is parts to the major action feature exposed so you cannot leave this set flush against an wall, but with a few mods to my moc and this set slides right into it. for 19,99$ or for what i got it, 15.00$ from walmart&nbsp;plus shipping&nbsp;was 22.49$ but got it early in January, this is ok buy but its does have 2 major wanted mobs baby zombie and the bat and yes this bat only came in one set before and its the mountain cave. if you purchase this set i hope you enjoy!!!!&nbsp;</p>
