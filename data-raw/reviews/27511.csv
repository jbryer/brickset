<p>THE BUILD</p>

<p>this set is weird on the way it is built,&nbsp;every few moments i would get confused on where the tree and wood posts with torches go! why? well for starters the igloo is not using the 2*2*4 building technique like the other sets in the line, the only one that i could think of that also had this problem was the iron golem, another thing is with the 1*2*3 hinges used to hold the roof on, other than that this set has a lot of good things going for it.</p>

<p>TOOLS AND BLOCKS</p>

<p>this set has had a few parts/tools that i never owned before, 2 fish and 2 fishing rods [i think that there was an extra rod] the banner is cool, and another easy way to get an Diamond&nbsp;sword. another thing that this set has is the inclusion of the leather pants and the diamond helmet. for blocks they have the chest, furnace, and a lime bed. the furnace is the new 2018 version that has 2 sides. another thing this set has is the fixed dispenser [non removable] and the wooded pressure plate, some ice and a big tree.</p>

<p>THE MOBS</p>

<p>Alex: another Alex&nbsp;with a diamond helmet&nbsp;and leather pants, she holds the diamond sword...</p>

<p>BABY POLARBEAR: this is cute... the size of a pig and is relatively comparable to size to the real one...</p>

<p>ADULT POLARBEAR: this is a bit oversized but wow this has a cool feature with the maul attack, another thing i found was when you separate the polar bears&nbsp;upper body and the lower body you can see a red stud [a bit grim lego...]</p>

<p>STRAY</p>

<p>finally a new hostile mob, and sofar the only 1.10&nbsp;mob and the coolest in this set...</p>

<p>PLAY</p>

<p>this set is fun&nbsp;with,the roof being able open and it being the only frostburn update set available&nbsp;right now</p>

<p>CONCUSION</p>

<p>this set is fun, this brings me joy! i am a fan of winter sets and if you enjoy winter and the frostburn update then this&nbsp;set is for you</p>

<p>MODDING&nbsp;AND IMPROVEMENTS</p>

<p>my plans with this set is to remove the latter and the wood with torches, also the dispenser, and the pressure plate, making this set not player made... but the natural spawning igloo...</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-07-31T17:23:40.13Z","Polar Bears Save the Day.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #21142 The Polar Igloo:</b> I haven&rsquo;t purchased a LEGO Minecraft set in a long while, and these sets are still fairly creative and impressive in my mind, so here we get to finally see my thoughts on another set from this Theme. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll enjoy my ramblings on a set based on a game I don&rsquo;t actually play&hellip; hmmm, kind of like my Overwatch reviews.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: LEGO Minecraft packaging has been the same for a good half decade now and here we see that it hasn&rsquo;t much changed from the last time I owned a set. There has been one minor change, instead of just Steve in the corner of the box we now also have Alex.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: A thick manual is what we have here with all of the steps the build the model by the numbered bag approach, or modular build steps if I&rsquo;m not mistaken. You can build this very easily without any problems, also no stickers. It&rsquo;s all printed details where Minecraft is concerned.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">These Minecraft sets are a great source of bricks, it&rsquo;s like buying Classic LEGO Bricks buckets only with a model instead of just being creative and use my imagination kind of deal for building anything you want. Seriously LEGO Minecraft is the best for parts packs.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Alex: This is the standard female representative for players, or avatar to use the proper term. She has limited print on her torso and has not been customized. Her accessories include a helmet which slides over her square head design and a fishing rod. Alex is fishing peacefully outside her igloo when the Stray attacks, will she survive? You decide the adventure as you play with this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Stray: This is an enemy which uses the LEGO skeleton for primary build, the head is new and a cloak is included made out of cloth that drapes over the skeleton&rsquo;s torso. It also carries a bow and arrow. Very menacing looking with some sparse detailing on the facial print, but overall a very interesting and unique character design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Polar Bear: This is a buildable creature, not a Minifigure, but I&rsquo;ll discuss it here because the box calls both bears out on the front as buildable creatures. The larger/adult bear has hinged rear legs so you can pose it in a few different poses while on display.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Baby Polar Bear: This smaller bear is built using the same unique element for the head of the creature, the torso is smaller and does not include the hinge joint for posing. Both buildable creatures are very nice and unique in the design and I was thrilled when I finished their builds.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 1: This is pretty much building the two buildable creatures, some accessories and the Minifigures. It&rsquo;s quick and easy and pretty fun honestly. There isn&rsquo;t a whole lot to discuss with this build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 2: This is primarily a large portion of the Polar Igloo with exterior detailing, this build works great and is actually quite enjoyable. Incidentally it should be noted that a lot of the set uses bricks, which is atypical of most LEGO sets, and by bricks of course I&rsquo;m talking about the 2x4 and 2x2 variety. I enjoyed this build, very nice use of elements to get the detailing just right, LEGO and Minecraft go hand-in-hand so well it&rsquo;s not much of a surprise that the builds are all so incredibly amusing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 3: The roof and more detailing including another brick-built tree is featured with this build, it&rsquo;s a pretty straight forward build with no real problems or issues to speak of. Very enjoyable and highly unique compared to most LEGO builds I do. Maybe that&rsquo;s why I had so much fun with the Minecraft sets I&rsquo;ve gotten so far.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Polar Igloo: This is a big blocky set piece. Naturally gamers will know a lot more about this particular area of the game if they play it, as I don&rsquo;t actually play Minecraft I can&rsquo;t call out all of the accurate detailing that I&rsquo;m sure is part of this set. As an example I&rsquo;m not entirely sure what material is used in the build of the sword, or any of the potential biome references in the set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">That being said the model is a solid looking one and features some very nice accessories, you have the brick-built tree with jumper plates used to simulate snow covering the leaves. You also get a flick-fire missile to handle the Stray. The interior has a nice bed and what I believe is referred to as a crafting thing, I think you craft with them. You also get a stove for forging. Please forgive me if I&rsquo;ve screwed up what those are.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a pretty decent set from last year. I bought it on sale at The LEGO Store priced lower than MSRP which is pretty good. Overall I enjoyed this set, the build is nice, the characters unique and the printed detailing is very impressive. I&rsquo;d recommend it for fans of clever and unique builds that work perfectly as a LEGO model. Highly recommended.</p>
