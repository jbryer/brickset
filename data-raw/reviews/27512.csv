<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BOX: it was in a box about the size of the ice spikes and the first night</p>

<p>MINIFIGURES: this set gave me many wanted figures,</p>

<p>GHAST:a full size ghast perfect in parts and in feature if you push a axel&nbsp;in the rear of the ghast it shoots a printed 2*2 disk with printing of a fire charge. all though this new ghast is not too good looking with the new 2018 flower piece for eyes... oh and the entire build is upside down. my only complaint&nbsp;it the eyes they should of put a extra set of eyes and make the current ones removable.</p>

<p>BABY PIGMEN: i personally&nbsp;love this figure and could open a wave &nbsp;possibilities, from baby villagers&nbsp;to zombified&nbsp;villager baby.&nbsp;</p>

<p>BLAZE: just a standard&nbsp;blaze.... cool</p>

<p>MAGMACUBE: they now have 3 sets this comes in and i just love them.</p>

<p>STEVE: just Steve but outfitted with iron leggings and enchanted iron Hemet and a Diamond&nbsp;chest plate, he has a diamond sword and a Diamond&nbsp;pickaxe, finally a set with a cheep way to get a shield.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BLOCKS AND ITEMS</p>

<p>this set comes with many blocks and items for instance it has glowstone and for the first time magma!!! it has nether-quartze... cool to get more. for items there is potion of strength and a bed. a chest with a diamond pickaxe. of course i comes with a minecart which is the mountan cave varent instead of the nether railway.</p>

<p>THE SET</p>

<p>it is a great set with [note first nether portal itself for me!!!!!] a overall a rather large rail intersection... now my complaint for this set is the nether portal is too close to the intersection so in order for the portal to close when you put the minecart though the portal it doesn&#39;t close when you are in and at the cross track. now im not one to complain about the picture that is shown but it doesn&#39;t come with a brick separator... so brick set could you get a more acuate picture instead of the current one? just saying.</p>

<p>[END] RESULT</p>

<p>for 39.99$ this was a great set but has some flaws, for an example the portal can get stuck open due to the friction the obsidian has on it. it is a great buy expectably for the figures and if you want a nether portal if you didn&#39;t buy the netherfortess and get the portal there then i highly recommend this, now i did modified the set with extra baseplates and bricks to put a wall on the other side of the portal. hope this review was helpfull for your minecraft needs and happy new year</p>

"Mole777","2018-10-15T19:01:00.547Z","An Upgrade from The Nether Fortress","<p>The build: Pretty simple, thought the Ghast&nbsp;is a bit complicated, as the result is upside-down.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: The Ghast: It has a great play value, and it has room for 2 fireballs in it&#39;s mouth,</p>

<p>which can shoot at the same time or together. It also has 9 tentacles improving on The Nether</p>

<p>Fortress&#39;s 8 tentacles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steve: A good mix of amour, and a way to get the enchanted helmet and the shield without</p>

<p>spending $100.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Blaze: A good design, the same as the Nether Fortress&#39;s Blaze.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Magma&nbsp;Cube: Good printing, though it would be better if it was medium sized instead of</p>

<p>small, as the small version has already been released in 2 cheaper sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Baby Zombie Pigman: A great minifigure&nbsp;with great printing, possibly the best in the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Main Set: Fantastic! The go-through-the-portal-and-into-the-Nether function works well,</p>

<p>though if Steve is holding his diamond sword is sometimes it gets caught. More minetrack</p>

<p>would also be an excellent&nbsp;improvement. The lava dropping function usually just drops on the</p>

<p>victim&#39;s head and stays there instead of knocking it over. Overall a great set!</p>
