If you are into Minecraft, this (in my opinion) is the best set you can get for its price. It has great figures and a great value (at least in the US). The horse and rabbit figures are especially good. The nametags that you can put on the animals are really cool. It also has great customizability.&nbsp;Overall I would give this set a A-. It is a really solid set.</p>
