<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Black Panther has some blue pattern over his suit to recreate&nbsp;its kinetic&nbsp;properties. The gray pattern matches his other 2018 minifigure, with eyes open.&nbsp;The official picture in the database deceive us: it&#39;s not vivid&nbsp;blue, it&#39;s more like a silver metallic blue, very distinctive. He and Erik have printing on the back of the torso and head. There are some &quot;black over black&quot; details to represent the fabric of the uniform. Unfortunately, there&#39;s no leg printing. In fact, one of the downsides of this set is that the all minifigures&nbsp;have simple black legs.</p>

<p>Erik Killmonger&nbsp;has the alternative suit that Shuri&nbsp;had&nbsp;offered his brother earlier in the movie. Erik&#39;s Golden&nbsp;Jaguar suit even&nbsp;cooler than T&#39;Challa&#39;s. It&nbsp;has a more menacing look (hey, he&#39;s the bad guy) and more intricate patterns on the mask. Much like T&#39;Challa, the details on his uniform aren&#39;t&nbsp;yellow like the database photo, but golden instead.&nbsp;One downside is that he hasn&#39;t neither his sword nor his half spear, which plays a key part in the fight.</p>

<p>Okoye&nbsp;has a very detailed Dora Milage&nbsp;General uniform, with different shades of orange, yellow and brown. She is armed with a silver vibranium spear, as she should be. A&nbsp;piece of fabric to cover the lower half of the uniform would add some fidelity, however she couldn&#39;t&nbsp;ride the rhino with it.&nbsp;Her confident expression works well.</p>

<p>You get two spare &quot;cat ears&quot; pieces, in case you lose both or if you want to make any minifigure more cat like.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The mine cart and track is very simple but still has a high tech vibe from Wakanda. 1x1 dark&nbsp;blue pieces being placed asymmetrically&nbsp;give&nbsp;the look of rocks on the surface. The&nbsp;model is basically moving the cart to the very limited track&nbsp;and at the end, pushing down the lever to knock down the cart. Works well although it doesn&#39;t always fall sideways as it&#39;s supposed to be. The 1x2 clear blue are&nbsp;supposed to be Vibranium&nbsp;being transported. I&#39;d say one more track piece would definitely improve its looks.</p>

<p>The rhino is very nice. It bears a similarity with the Luggabeast&nbsp;from the Encounter on Jakku set. Its proportions are very good and details like its ears and moving tail make it more animalistic than brick built, even though the armor stickers make it look more like a&nbsp;machine. The range of movement of the neck and legs allows you to pose it statically or charging through battle. The stud shooters fit well in the model, since they opted for a more armored animal.</p>

<p>On a side note, I got impressed about the number of&nbsp;spare parts this came set, with almost a dozen.</p>

<h3>Faithfulness to the movie (no spoilers)</h3>

<p>This set represents the final battle of the movie, which occurs in a Vibranium mine, as shown in the trailers. Needless to say, its tracks are&nbsp;scaled waaaaay down. In the movie, it&#39;s supposed to be large enough both on width and length due to being train tracks and not mine carts. At least this choice made the price more accessible;&nbsp;I don&#39;t think a huge train track playset&nbsp;would be needed only for two minifigures&nbsp;battle each other.</p>

<p>Rhinos also appear in this battle but I can&#39;t remember exactly if they have this armored-mecha look of the set. They also don&#39;t knock down mine carts. The rhino is not mounted by Okoye&nbsp;but she does have a&nbsp;key role with it.</p>

<p>Black Panther&#39;s suit kinetic effects should be more purplish instead of silver&nbsp;blue. I believe the initial concept art for his suit was blue and by the time the movie the trailer were out, toy factories didn&#39;t have time to change the color to what they&#39;re supposed to be (Funko line is another example of blue instead of purple). Luckily, the blue effects are still beautiful and very unique.</p>

<h3>Final impressions</h3>

<p>I highly recommend this set. The rhino is well built, Black Panther and Erik minifigures&nbsp;have&nbsp;impressive colors and patterns and&nbsp;Okoye&nbsp;is simple but a nice addition. It could be better, yeah, but I prefer this content at this price range.</p>

"Andy317","2018-06-04T19:45:23.527Z","Wakanda Forever!","<p>For only 20 bucks, you get three exclusive minifigures, a pretty awesome main build, an above average side build, and a stellar price to part ratio, considering there are some bigger parts. What else can I say? This is a must buy for any Black Panther Set. My one complaint (which is a minor one) is that the mine could be a little bigger, but then it would jack up the price. Overall, this is great, i wouldn&rsquo;t have even minded if they made this 25 or 30.&nbsp;</p>

"Faefrost","2019-01-22T05:54:14.637Z","It's a brick built rhino. Thats pretty much it","<p>Welcome to the least interesting set in the Lego Marvel lineup last year (OK still not as bad as the Iron Man 3 &quot;Iron Man vs Homeless Hobo Shopping Cart Final Battle!&quot;) This is a perfect specimen of what frustrates fans about some Marvel sets. In so many we get great, must have minifigs, and then just &quot;a wall&quot; or a &quot;jeep&quot;. This one gives us a Go nowhere mine cart, and a semi brick built rhino or cyborg rhino or somesuch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions - This one is on deep clearance everywhere. For half MSRP. As you might guess the box art of a Rhino and little dinky mine car did not compel buyers at MSRP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts. It actually has some interesting pieces, some interesting slopes on the rhino.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs&nbsp;- The figs are the (only) selling point of the set. We Have Black Panther in his final full powered up Vibranium Suit (Light blue metalic&nbsp;torso and head printing over black. No printed legs) We have Kilmonger&nbsp;almost identicle&nbsp;wearing his more gaudy Black Panther suit (Black with gold printing front back torso and head No printed legs)&nbsp; You will need good light to tell those two apart. The final fig is Okoye. She is the standout fig. The one that everyone really wants so they can have their complete Avengers lineup for their IW scene. She has a detailed torso front and back. Single face. Unprinted legs. She carries a spear.</p>

<p>Build/Model - The set is two models. Both equally laughable. Bag 1 builds the worlds smallest mine train. A mine car of Vibrainium that sits on approximately 10 scale feet of track, So the mine car can go back and forth 1 car length. Play value = negligible. Next up is bags 2 and 3. You get to Frankenstein together a super Cyborg&nbsp;Rhino for reason...? The Rhino is nice, but not exciting and lacks when viewed through a fun factor filter. It feels like a Chima leftover.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overview - And that&#39;s it. Not much too it. Rhino vs Mail cart, The BP figure you likely have, This is masked suited Kilmonger, and Okoye&nbsp;makes this set a must have.&nbsp;</p>

"vikings","2020-06-02T20:39:09.313Z","Great Figures, Okay Rhino,  and That's it. ","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a small/medium box. You get two small/medium instruction booklets (for some reason). The first instruction booklet is for the minecart and track and the second one is for the rhino.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some good parts in this set. You get two 2x8 light grey rails, four dark tan legs, 2x4x4 trans blue glass wall, and two 4x3x3 black design bricks. You get 11 stickers (all on the rhino). Overall a decent piece haul. The total piece count for the set is 229.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Black Panther:</strong></p>

<p>Black Panther is my least favorite figure in the set. For starters the blue printing is inaccurate to the movie (especially in the part of the movie the set is in). The color should have been purple instead of blue. He has black horns on top of his head. His head has blue and silver printing in great detail on it. His torso has the same printing with silver and blue markings highlighting his armor. He has plain black legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Killmonger:</strong></p>

<p>Killmonger is similar to&nbsp;Black Panther. He has&nbsp;black horns on top of his head. He has gold markings in great detail on his head. He has the Black Panther suit necklace on his torso. His torso is covered in black and gold markings. He has plain black legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Okoye:</strong></p>

<p>She has a brown head with an angry facial expression on it. She has printing of orange armor with brown straps. I am a disappointed that there is no red printing on her torso as there is some on her in the movie.&nbsp;She also has plain black legs. She is armed with a silver spear.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was easy, there was nothing to it. It took me less than 30 minutes to build it. You have two separate builds in this set. The first is the mine track and cart. The other is the war rhino.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>So overall&nbsp;this set is a bit confusing when you compare it to the movie. The mine cart is very disappointing and incredibly inaccurate to the movie. In the movie the minecart is (I believe) a train carrying vibranium. So this was disappointing in that it was the best Lego could do. The Rhino looks more robotic than it does looking&nbsp;like it is wearing armor. The Rhino is in the battle above on the surface and the minecart is underground so having the two together doesn&#39;t make much sense (At least to me).&nbsp;This set could have been much better than it was and should have been two sets (The Killmonger-Black Panther battle in the mine and the above ground battle on the surface with the Rhino and Okoye). The set itself is okay. The Rhino is pretty good if the stickers didn&#39;t make it look like a cyborg. It is armed with two stud shooters (Also inaccurate, but a decent play feature). The mine also has a play feature that launches the cart off the tracks. It holds three pieces of vibranium (1x2 trans blue plates). The figures are the only reason to get the set. You get two exclusive minifigures in this set (Killmonger in the Black Panther suit and Okoye). The figures are defiantly worth getting. My only problem is that the blue color on Black Panther is wrong and should be purple instead of blue. It is a really disappointing set with it being incredibly inaccurate to what happens in the movie. I do recommend getting this (only for the figures) to add to your Lego Marvel Collection. If you are not a fan of the Marvel sets I don&#39;t think this set is for you. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 3-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

My one complaint&nbsp;is that the play feature doesn&#39;t&nbsp;work amazing. Black Panther and Killmonger&nbsp;both look awesome&nbsp;4/5</p>

First, it has a mechanism that makes the mine cart explode of the railing. Second, it has a great price it has 229 pieces&nbsp;for 21 dollars.&nbsp; Last, it is very entertaining&nbsp; I watched the cart explode&nbsp;of the railing for a while and did not get bored. It is a very cool set you need to buy!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-29T13:06:41.207Z","Enter Wakanda","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #76099 Rhino Face-Off by the Mine:</b> Black Panther was a huge break out hit for Marvel Studios and LEGO created two sets based on the Theme. I already discussed the Royal Talon Fighter earlier and now it&rsquo;s time to discuss the cheaper of the two sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: This Marvel Super Heroes box shows off the set very impressively and the design is still pretty much the standard for LEGO Marvel. The Black Panther logo is on the bottom of the box so you know which film from the MCU this is meant to evoke.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: The modular build of this set is broken up into three numbered bags and LEGO once again printed two numbered manuals based on the two separate models in the set. This makes for a huge waste of paper since the initial build is a very small model and the build is done within 27 pages. 27 Pages which could have been the first half of a much larger single manual, but LEGO chose a different approach here and it isn&rsquo;t exactly bad, just a bit questionable as numbered manuals can easily be misplaced. (Something which I have not considered or mentioned before because I typically store my manuals together to avoid losing them, but I&rsquo;m an AFOL, I&rsquo;m certain KFOLs have misplaced many manuals in their time&hellip; I mean I know I did for ALL of my old LEGO manuals when I was a kid.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set includes two rail track elements and four of the large animal legs which were first used in the Jakku set with Teedo and his beast. These are the stand out elements for me especially as LEGO rail tracks are often in large demand by Train enthusiasts, the rest of the set is fairly loaded with generic/common elements, though of course a few other parts that are less common are included I just have no idea what they&rsquo;re called. I believe they are the NEXO Knights armor chest elements from the buildable Battle Armors.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Black Panther: The printing on this Minifigure shares similar design cues from his past two versions, however I do believe that the costume itself is meant to represent the final film version he is seen wearing during the climactic battle. The detailing is picked out quite nicely with almost electric blue lines that draw your eye to the detailing and his entire torso and legs are printed with these lines. The legs are plain, no markings; he also has no accessories.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Killmonger: Dressed in stolen Panther armor with the teeth necklace which we saw in the film early on, Killmonger in this set is very similar to Black Panther, using all of the same colour parts featuring a unique print on his torso which differs from Panther, yet is very similar. Definitely two sides of the same coin and great for fans of the characters as seen in the movie.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Okoye: She includes an ordinary spear and has a different coloured torso compared to Nakia, but is meant to bear similar markings. Although I did think that all of the Dora Milage had the more red coloured armor that Nakia wore not some golden orangeish colour combination. Her torso and face are the only printed elements and she has no hair piece.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 1: This is a very quick little build making a small Vibranium mine cart with a minor piece of track to include some play features. It&rsquo;s a relatively quick build and somewhat disappointing, nowhere near as satisfying as the Royal Talon Fighter.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 2: The Rhino in this set is not a solid animal, but rather a buildable creature which is actually kind of interesting. It reminds me somewhat of the buildable creatures found in the LEGO Chima line, and this build works on a lot of levels. I found this much more satisfying as a build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 3: This portion of the build is extremely repetitive, both sets of legs share building techniques and so you will be building relatively similar portions of the finished model. The included stickers are used for detailing with the set and are not that difficult to apply compared to some sets. It&rsquo;s a solid build and quick to finish off the Rhino.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Rhino: A very chunky solid creature built out of LEGO, this definitely could fit in with the other brick-built animals from Chima. It has a spot where a Minifigure can sit and two stud shooters attached to the saddle area for play features, but the biggest draw is just that it&rsquo;s a huge chunky model that can charge your heroes or villains and help fight against them.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Mine: I use this terminology very loosely, this is a mine cart with Vibranium meant to represent the large train that both Wakandans fight around during the final scenes of the movie. As a side build it&rsquo;s not terrible, but it is mediocre considering what other side builds LEGO Marvel has given us in the past.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I purchased this on sale now that it is retiring soon or has been retired and I would strongly recommend getting it at a discount price compared to the full price of 25$ Canadian. This set is a solid little add-on for the Royal Talon Fighter set with some necessary variants of characters from Black Panther, but it doesn&rsquo;t really feature a &lsquo;Mine&rsquo; despite what the set is called. I think a slightly larger bit of set piece with perhaps one extra track piece and a larger opening wall/cave entrance build would have worked.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Rhino is the stand out model of this set and I recommend it for that reason alone. Recommended.</p>
