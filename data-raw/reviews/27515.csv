"B21","2018-02-18T23:48:59.757Z","Royal Talon Fighter Review","<p>Today I&rsquo;ll be reviewing the Royal Talon Fighter Attack set, which is set 76100. It includes 358 pieces and four exclusive minifigures for $30.</p>

<h3>The Minifigures</h3>

<p>The first minifigure is Black Panther himself, who has a lot of accurate silver printing with some subtle black printing underneath. It has a unique face print where you can see his eyes and skin underneath the mask. This minfigure also includes back printing and printing on the back of the head.</p>

<p>The main villain of the set is Killmonger, and has a great new mask mold with a lot of intricate printing. His head has&nbsp;a generic face that has been used before, and that doesn&rsquo;t look like the character. His torso and legs have good printing too. Killmonger holds a flick-fire weapon that looks a bit bulky, but is still fun to play with.</p>

<p>Nakia is another great figure in this set. She has a brand new mold for her hair which will be useful for other figures in the future. Her head has two face prints that both look like the character which is good. Her torso has a great and accurate print on the front and back, although her legs lack printing. She holds two silver ring pieces, which are new for this set.</p>

<p>Ulysses Klawe&nbsp;is the last minifigure&nbsp;for this set, and probably my least favorite. His hair is black in this set, but it should really be a dark gray color. He has an angry face, and a grunting face, which both look good, except for the hair color, again. His torso print is accurate, and his legs have no printing. He holds a gun metal gray&nbsp;arm gauntlet, which also looks inaccurate. However, you can attach a transparent blue lightning bolt piece to the gauntlet, which I like.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The Royal Talon Fighter itself is a wonderful build. It has a lot of useful pieces in black and gun metal gray. It is very sturdy and has some fun play features, including an open jail cell and stud shooters on both sides. Nakia&nbsp;can fit in the front of the ship, and there are two&nbsp;double cheese slopes with stickers for control panels. The jail cell can fit one minifigure, but it doesn&rsquo;t have much head room. The twelve fin pieces that run along the sides of the set give it a unique look. On the back, there is an exhaust area that uses some uncommon pieces. Overall, this ship is great and is accurately sized.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This set is great. You get four amazing minifigures&nbsp;and a now iconic ship for just $30. I highly recommend it if you&rsquo;re a fan of Marvel or Black Panther.&nbsp;</p>

The BP figure in this set is much closer to the movie versions I feel, but would have preferred no visible eyes. Killmonger is the best figure for me but Lego needs to up its game on rocket launchers!?. Klaue needed grey hair not black and the hand blaster...what is up with that!? The craft itself is pretty cool but I&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t bother with the stickers. Why they didn&rsquo;t use translucent bricks for the engines is beyond me!? (Used em on the polybag Talon!?...) Though translucent bricks are&nbsp;used&nbsp;inside the build. Think I&rsquo;ll swap out the purple engine bricks for the translucent blue ones and use the translucent sttud from the shooter to make the engines look better.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-29T13:09:57.643Z","Wakanda Air Fleet Strikes","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #76100:</b> Marvel Super Heroes started out strong with MCU Black Panther based sets in 2018, this is the larger of the two sets and more expensive, it offered four figures and a large build of the Royal Talon Fighter, which was also made in smaller scale in a polybag of this year. Much like the film the LEGO is a huge hit with this fan and we&rsquo;ll discuss why in the following review.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: Marvel Super Heroes boxes are all red, we&rsquo;ve seen them before and discussed them quite a lot. The images on the front of the box show a very great action shot while the back showcases all of the features and a continuation of the action shot on the front showing what happens next.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: Modular bag builds are how the instructions are set out and they are bound in a nice thick card stock that keeps the paper from being too creased. A sticker sheet is also included, however it seems that LEGO has stopped producing separate comic books with art depicting adventures of the sets. On the one hand I actually miss them, as they were also where the Minifigure checklists were kept, on the other it&rsquo;s a decent decision as it means there are no more comics to be creased or damaged when packaged in the box.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A large number of the elements in this set are black and various shades of grey, there are a few minor other coloured elements, but primarily you&rsquo;ll find black and grey. Half circular bricks of a large scale are found in the set, the type used commonly in saucer type space ships. Overall a lot of parts for folks to look forward to here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Black Panther: This version of Black Panther isn&rsquo;t as detailed as his original Civil War costume, the ear head piece is no longer printed, but the facial print does show the eyes more which is a feature I don&rsquo;t recall from his movie counterpart. He has no leg printing, no accessories and a simpler design for his double-sided torso. Overall not my favorite version of the figure, but fairly accurate to the newer costume worn in the film.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Killmonger: The primary antagonist of the film, Kllmonger has a dual-sided torso with a pretty solid print which matches the outfit he wore through most of the film. His head is a single-sided facial print and his legs feature pockets printed above his knees. For a head piece they sculpted a brand new helmet element which matches the old mask he stole from the museum, unfortunately he does not also come with a unique hair sculpt. His accessory is a flick-fire missile launcher built out of four elements to represent the missile launcher he used to free Klaue.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Nakia: This ally of Black Panther possesses a double-sided torso print with impressively detailed print, a dual-sided face with a smiling expression on one side and a smirking expression on the other. Her hair piece seems to be brand new and her accessories are large circular rings based on the weapons she used in the film.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ulyses Klaue: This Minifigure represents a great villainous character. It has an interesting new hair piece, which I&rsquo;m afraid doesn&rsquo;t quite match the colour of the hair seen in the film, it isn&rsquo;t as graying enough. The facial print, which is double-sided and has two sneering or scowling type expressions with dark facial hair actually shows graying at the temples and sprinkled in the beard&hellip; the fact the hair piece doesn&rsquo;t have greying print to match is a bit unfortunate.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The torso is nice though with a good representation of his outfit from the film on a double-sided print and his accessory is as close as we can get to his energy blaster arm, it uses an element from Ninjago/Chima and a nifty electric burst accessory first seen in the Series 2 Batman CMF line, unless it was also introduced in Ninjago, though I don&rsquo;t think it was.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 1: Black Panther leaps to action as the skeleton of the Royal Talon Fighter are constructed with this bag, it&rsquo;s a fairly simple and quick build with a very solid looking superstructure. There&rsquo;s some repetition when you get to the final few steps, but overall it&rsquo;s a solid build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 2: Killmonger and Nakia tackle on another as you construct more of the Royal Talon Fighter adding more detailing and plates to flesh out the design considerably. This is a quick and satisfying build as well with easy-to-follow steps and nothing tricky or difficult aside from the sticker placement on parts, which may require support for younger builders. (Being anyone under the recommended age on the box, seven and up should have no problem in applying stickers.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 3: Klaue joins the fray in this final bag and the build completes the entire ship. There&rsquo;s a fair bit of repetition in this build as well, but it&rsquo;s still quite satisfying and again the only issues might be placement of stickers.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Royal Talon Fighter: This model is extremely impressive and unique looking, compared to the previous Black Panther vehicle based set, this one is a much more interesting design and features some very unique construction moments. Also it&rsquo;s capable of holding two or three Minifigures, one pilot and two passengers in the rear compartment.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It is a little awkward to pick up and play with, but once you get your fingers around the sweet spot, or the place where you can hold it just right, you can fly it around to stop Killmonger and Klaue from getting away. There are two stud shooters incorporated into the design very nicely so that they are not intrusive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The front section looks like a cat&rsquo;s head, which is really fun and something I didn&rsquo;t notice when watching the movie.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a pretty solid set, it&rsquo;s got a great selection of characters some nice minimalistic play features and the model is a truly unique and exciting design. A far cry from the numerous jets and other similar vehicles we&rsquo;ve gotten in the past. In Canada this set costs 40$ before taxes, this might seem like a lot, but there are a considerable number of uncommonly found parts in a set of this type, two of the large clear donut pieces are also there.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">To that end I&rsquo;d recommend getting this before it&rsquo;s gone. It&rsquo;s a great set from a great MCU film and features a lot of nice design cues and build techniques to make a solid model. I would recommend trying to get it during a sale though as I feel that the MSRP on this one at least in Canada is a bit high for a 360 piece set.</p>

<p>After watching Black Panther, I was absolutely astonished with the details that were attended to by the writers and director of the movie. This is not meant to be a movie review, but this model left me very satisfied with the impact of this franchise. Though the model may be a tad small for some Lego and/or Marvel fans, I am still impressed by the accuracy from the movie. I do commend Lego for not backing down from getting every detail possible in this compact build.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What I enjoyed about this&nbsp;set:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The minifigures&nbsp;really made this set stand alone in the Marvel universe Lego sets. Each character has had an impact on many communities throughout the world and touched the lives of so many. Kilmonger&#39;s&nbsp;mask is so innately detailed and made the character seem more powerful than the other characters, such as he was during the movie. T&#39;Challa&nbsp;symbolizes the power within leaders in the African American community and enabled the movie to perpetuate into an instant classic. The minifigure itself lacked differentiability from the Kilmonger&nbsp;figure in the Rhinoceros set from the series. Klaue&nbsp;was also very menacing in his movie and minifigure&nbsp;depiction. Nakia&nbsp;represented a powerful feminine figure in the movie, allowing for a strong message that extended through the two and half hour movie.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What I disliked about this set:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The only factor that I disliked was the compactness of the set. It seemed too small when I was building the ship. I understand that Lego needs to make a model with certain prices in mind, but they could have made the vehicle to encapsulate&nbsp;the swath of characters, instead of having half of them outside of the Attacker. The jail-cell within the Royal Talon, albeit very large in relation to the vehicle itself, it did compromise the proportions of the pilot&#39;s seat. Only one character can fit in the cockpit, which makes the model lack in accuracy. Details are necessary for the major fans of th movie, but do not help in the feasibility of this model.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Would I recommend this set?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The legacy of Black Panther is a testament&nbsp;to the effective use of limited political views in Marvel movies. With this in mind, Lego did an exceptional job with the construction of such an accurate Lego model. Every single detail from the Royal Talon was not excluded within the model, allowing for any fan of the movie to be prideful with the designers of such a beautiful set.&nbsp;</p>

"Anorak719","2018-10-08T01:10:17.03Z","One 2018's Best >$30 sets","<p>This set is not only one of the best Marvel sets to date, it&#39;s also one of the best sub-$30 sets of 2018.</p>

<p>The Build</p>

<p>I personally don&#39;t tend to notice much about the build unless it was particularly memorable, and to be honest, this one wasn&#39;t super memorable. It was relatively quick (I&#39;m a slow builder and it took me 25 minutes) and relatively simple. There was some repetition when it came to inputting the wings on the side, and overall it wasn&#39;t super memorable, so i&#39;m giving the Build process a 4/5.</p>

<p>The Minifigures</p>

<p>When it comes to Superhero sets, I&#39;ll take all the figures they have to offer. 4 figs in a $30 set is about par for the course. Black Panther looks off slightly (I think it&#39;s due to the eyes showing), but hey! It&#39;s a black panther figure. Killmonger is a fine figure, he has a rubber helmet to represent the tribal mask, and a brick-built rocket launcher. Klaue&nbsp;has a full-on glove with lightning to represent his prosthetic hand. This may not be accurate to the film, but it doesn&#39;t detract in any way. Finally, Nakia&#39;s&nbsp;figure is, I think, the weakest of the bunch. She features a new (?) hairpiece and accessory, but that&#39;s the most interesting part. Couple this with the fact that she&#39;s actually wearing the wrong clothing for the scene, and she&#39;s easily not as good as the other three figures. However, I think that overall these figures are exceptional, warranting a 5/5.</p>

<p>The Set</p>

<p>This set is not lacking in playability. The ship has missiles, an opening cockpit and jail section, and it&#39;s an overall cool design. It&#39;s great to display, or to play with. Easy 5/5.</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>Big 5/5, for all the reasons I mentioned above. Plus the price-to-part ratio is great as well, and in the US it&#39;s getting 20% discounts. Pick it up asap!</p>
