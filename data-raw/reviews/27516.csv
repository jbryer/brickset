"mini_mads1980","2018-01-24T11:55:25.94Z","Certainly Worth a Purchase","<p>This set is certainly worth buying.&nbsp; When you consider that a collectable minifigure&#39;s value is now &pound;2.99; getting two minifigures, a bike in a rare colour and a small build then the price is acceptable.</p>

<h2>Box</h2>

<p>The box is of the standard small size for these type of sets, and shows a nice image of the crook getting away with a diamond.&nbsp; He is being chased by&nbsp;a green snake and the policeman on his bike.&nbsp; You can see too, that he has abandoned the ruby in his haste to escape.</p>

<p>The back of the box shows that the policeman has won the chase and the thief is currently in custody.&nbsp; On the top of the box there is an image of the crime taking place, along with a 1:1 scale image of the mountain policeman.</p>

<h2>Instructions/Box Contents</h2>

<p>You get a small 20-page instruction book in the box, which is folded, and a small sticker sheet with two stickers.&nbsp; The booklet does not contain any images of the other mountain police sets.</p>

<p>All the pieces are in a single bag with no secondary bag containing the smaller pieces.&nbsp; This may be because the piece count is so small or could be a new packaging saving endeavor by TLG.</p>

<h2>Minifigues</h2>

<p>You get two in this set.&nbsp; The heroic mountain policeman and the thief.&nbsp; The law man comes with printing on the front and back of his torso and printing on the front of his legs.&nbsp; He sports a rather serious expression as he tries to catch the criminal and is wearing a fantastic trail bike helmet.</p>

<p>The crooked minifigure has only got printing on his torso and plain legs.&nbsp; The printing shows that he has recently escaped from custody as his prison uniform can be seen under his red jacket.&nbsp; His head has a ginger beard and he also has a gold tooth on show.&nbsp; A red cap and crow bar complete the minifig.</p>

<h2>Vehicles</h2>

<p>You only get one form of transport in this set, but for the price this is acceptable.&nbsp; The bike comes in blue for the first time since the Jurassic Park sets of 2015 where it only appeared once, so it is still quite rare.&nbsp; There are no surprises as the bike consists of the main two parts with two wheels and two pneumatic &quot;T&quot; shaped parts to complete the build.&nbsp; This new colour does appear two more times in the 2018 mountain police sets, so if you only want the bike this set might not be for you.</p>

<h2>Other Builds</h2>

<p>To complete the set you get a basic, but reasonable, rock build on a 4x6 green plate with a snake guarding the contents.&nbsp; The rock contains a hinged section, which is firm enough to keep open without holding, that itself contains a diamond and a ruby.&nbsp; My only criticism of this set would be here, as there is nowhere to&nbsp;hold the precious jewels, which therefore have to rest on top of the plate and rattle around.&nbsp; Maybe a 1x2x1 wall element could have been included to stop them falling out?&nbsp; I have added one to mine, and my four-year-old has so far not lost either!</p>

"Hashem1983","2018-07-07T12:09:09.7Z","Good for it's Price","<p>I bought this set from one of Hamley&#39;s stores in Jordan, along side 2 of the collectable mini-figures and that&#39;s because of its price, however I wasn&#39;t too much impressed about it but for those who likes the dirt motor bike then it will be a good deal for them to get it in a an economic set.</p>

<p>The parts are simply basic but you might find this set useful if you are looking for specific parts, the only thing is unique are the bike and the new helmet design.</p>

<p>There are 2 mini-figures in this set:</p>

<p>The Mountain police Officer: has a serious face that is covered with the new helmet mold in dark blue and the new white visor (with a spare part of the visor) double printed torso in light blue and sand tan legs with prints of the pocket.&nbsp;He also holds a handcuff for an accessory.</p>

<p>The Crook: I find him quite unique with his red torso that represents a jacket and underneath the gray and white stripes to represent the jail cloth, dark orange legs with no prints. As for the head he he has an orange beard with an evil smile and wears the new mold of the cap on red. He holds a crowbar for an accessory.</p>

<p>The build is very basic, you just build a simple rocky hideout to hide the 2 jewels in it, which is for the price its acceptable and nothing far from that except you get a green snake.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, if you like dirt bikes, you might find this set useful to get due to its price especially if you want to get something nice and affordable for your kids with some playability, but in my own opinion I did not like it that much, eventually it will&nbsp;&nbsp;all depends on your own taste.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-10-13T07:10:20.417Z","Cool parts, but boring set","<p>My son was so excited to get this as a gift.&nbsp; A motorcycle!&nbsp; A snake!&nbsp; Two diamonds!&nbsp; And that is where the excitement ended.</p>

<p>The overly simple cave (or whatever it is) is of no interest to him.&nbsp; And the...oh wait, that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>The police minifigure doesn&#39;t even look that much like a cop (at least not to a 5 year old) so it doesn&#39;t even get taken out with all his other police sets.&nbsp; And the bad guy minifigure, well he looks pretty normal, nothing about him screams criminal other than the crowbar, and my son is too young to know what a crowbar is.</p>

<p>In the end this set is really just disappointing.</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2021-03-15T18:11:32.81Z","A set with an abundance of surrounding negative energy but really isn't that bad .","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>The 2018 Lego city off-road chase is a set released and with&nbsp;(as far as I can tell) a mostly negative consensus but I really don&#39;t think it is that bad .</p>

<p>The Minifigures -</p>

<p>The Minifigures include a police officer with a dark blue biker helmet released in this city wave , a pair of white goggles , a serious face , a police torso and dark tan legs , he wields a pair of light grey handcuffs . Next we have a crook Minifigure with a newer baseball cap in red , a bushy ginger beard with an evil grin , a red jacket hardly&nbsp;covering up his obvious prison jumpsuit and some dark orange legs , he wields a trans red ruby and a trans clear diamond and a classic red crowbar . There is also a green snake included .</p>

<p>The builds -</p>

<p>The builds include a dirt bike , this has normal black tyres&nbsp;and grey wheels , a black frame with a kick stand on one side and a blue cover with a single police sticker . The other build is built on a 4&times;6 green plate with dark grey slope bricks around the back and sides with the centre hollowed out with a bar attaching to a 2&times;3 dark grey clip tile with a handle and sticker to allocate that it is the location of the valuables and the top has two 1&times;2 dark green slope bricks for added detail .</p>

<p>In conclusion -&nbsp;</p>

<p>this is a set that I think is quite good as the price of &pound;4.99 UK is very reasonable for a dirt bike , two figures and a side build , I do realise conversion rates do not match up with other countries so this set does seem overpriced , but &pound; wise it is a good value so I recommend it to anyone who has a desire to get this set despite it being retired at this point .&nbsp;</p>
