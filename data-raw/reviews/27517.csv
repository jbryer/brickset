<p>Although not officially called a &quot;Starter Set&quot;, this is basically the Mountain Police theme&#39;s starter set for 2018.&nbsp; I have always been a huge fan of these sets as you always get a good selection of minifigures and a fun way to have them interact.&nbsp; This&nbsp;set is no exception as it has two criminals and two members of the new Mountain Police.</p>

<h2>Box/Instructions</h2>

<p>Standard squarish box for this type of set.&nbsp; Not quite as deep as some have been, such as the mining one, but not too shallow.&nbsp; The front of the box shows off the whole of the set in all of it&#39;s glory, with the new beehive piece standing out.</p>

<p>The rear of the box has four images that show the male criminal breaking open the secret hiding spot in the tree, and instantly regretting it as the next image shows that the beehive has fallen on his head.&nbsp; The female criminal is also shown as she gets caught by the ATV driving Mountain Policeman as she tries to escape down the river.&nbsp; Finally, the story is complete as both Mountain Police characters have caught their escapees.</p>

<p>The instruction book is 36 pages long with 29 of them concerning the build.&nbsp; The image on the front matches the box, with a little bit more scenery on wither side of the main image.&nbsp; Unlike 60170 this set has images of some of the Mountain Police sets (60170, 60172, 60173, 60174 and 60176), Mining sets (60184, 60185, 60186 and 60188) and Great Vehicles (60177, 60178, 60179, 60180, 60181, 60182 and 60183).</p>

<p>As seems the norm nowadays there are 17 stages which only include one element to build with.&nbsp; I understand that this is aimed at an age group of 5-12, but it seems like too many steps are included for builds.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>The first minifigure that you build is one of three that are exclusive to this set and is the female crook.&nbsp; She comes with a back-pack and has an open red shirt which shows her prison uniform underneath.&nbsp; She has printing on both sides of her torso, but not on her legs.&nbsp; She is also given a spade.</p>

<p>The second minifigure is the female Mountain Police Officer.&nbsp; Again she only appears in this set and has printing on front and back of her torso, but only on the front of her legs.&nbsp; Her hat contains a pony tail.&nbsp; Her accessory is a radio.</p>

<p>Next up is the male criminal, who is also in 60175, who is still wearing the clothes he escaped from prison in.&nbsp; He has two faces on his head - the first is shocked at what he has found and the second is similar to the first but has bee stings all over.&nbsp; This man also has a spade?</p>

<p>The male Mountain Police Office is last.&nbsp; He has the same legs as his female counterpart but has a darker blue torso that is printed on both sides.&nbsp; He has a big grin on his face and comes with a white helmet and set of handcuffs (as normal you get a spare set too).</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>You start by building the log that the criminals escape.&nbsp; It is an easy build, but I don&#39;t know why they use 2x 1x1 studs with a stud on the side as these seem to twist making the legs of the minifigures slip off.&nbsp; The use of a 1x2 with&nbsp;two studs would have been better.&nbsp; I always get cynical with things like this and think that maybe they only do it to boost the piece count - four sounds better than two.&nbsp; Once built though you realise why both crooks have spades - it is so they can both paddle as they both fit on the log (when you can get them to stay).</p>

<p>The next build is the ATV.&nbsp; Nothing new to report here as this type of vehicle has been built time and again.&nbsp; It does what it needs to and is solid enough.&nbsp; The beacon comes off easily as only held on by one stud, but this doesn&#39;t take anything away from the set.</p>

<p>Finally you build the tree and you are required to wait till the final step before you put on the fantastic new beehive piece.&nbsp; This can be taken off of the tree and put over a minifigures head!</p>

"Japanbuilder","2018-02-27T23:36:14.257Z","Wonderful little set. ","<p>This little set has really won me over with both the play option available and the pieces included. Let&#39;s dive in!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Packaging:</strong></p>

<p>The usual fare for this year we get a nice box showing us some possible scenarios for the figures included in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside we will find 2 bags and one manual. Thankfully, there are no stickers to apply in this set and we get treated to a nice printed piece which we will see a bit later.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>These figures constitute possibly the main draw to this set as they will bolster your ranks of crooks and cops for your police or city display.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of note, to me, is the female officer which comes with a great dual molded head piece of ponytail and cap. The torso prints on all of these figures is outstanding and I like the shirt and tactical vest given to the police. Though I do wish these were gender neutral so you could swap the roles out if you want to. One of the crooks gets a double sided head piece with one side showing his aggressive demeanor and the other the side of him that just got schooled by the bees in the included beehive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We get a walkie-talkie, handcuffs, a backpack, and 2 shovels for accessories.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The build is quite simple but also satisfying. We get some great parts here in this little set, aside form the dual molded head piece for the female officer, we get a printed side of a cut tree, a beehive, and a new clip piece that makes up the police quad&#39;s bumper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is a shot of your spare parts when you are done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4708/40525289881_222a4aeef4.jpg[/img]</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>The completed set is great. The police quad looks outstanding to me in this shape with clips and attachments for a chain and accessories. It looks rather tough and ready with that new bumper piece and the rest of the elements are also great. The floating log for the crooks is cleverly made despite the low piece count and its printed piece will surely be great use to outdoor MOCs. The small tree structure that doubles as a stash for the crooks is also neat and has a moving part at the bottom to hide their gold ingots.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, like all city sets the crooks are hopelessly overmatched but that is half the fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>If you are into this line from LEGO then this set will surely please you. If you are into custom builds than some of the elements included in the set will surely please you. If you want a simple but nice build with plenty of play options this set should also please you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a very strong showing for such a simple model and worth every penny in my eyes.&nbsp;</p>

"Hashem1983","2018-07-21T16:38:14.847Z","Nice Decent set for its Parts & Figures","<p>I bought this set due to its cost, parts and figures, what you really get is quite valuable parts due to its small size, most importantly the bee hive and the molded cap with the pony tail for the female figure.</p>

<p>There are three small builds in this set, the escape log for the thieves, the tree with the hiding spot for the gold bars and the ATV, all three are easy&nbsp;to build.</p>

<p>The parts are also decent, as I mentioned previously, the bee hive and molded cap are the most interesting, you also get multi parts of&nbsp;the 2X2 round bricks, nice collection of accessories. What I most like are the spare parts as you get an extra stick and chain and as usual you do get a spare handcuffs.</p>

<p>There are 4 mini-figure in this set, a male and a female police office, I&#39;d like to mention that the smirky smile on the female face scared me for a police office. 2 male and a female criminals in their jail outfit, and&nbsp;the male is the only one in this set with double sided face, an angry face with a golden teeth, and other has bee stitches and that is&nbsp;in the scenario when place the bee hive on his head.</p>

<p>Overall, its a nice decent set for its figures and parts and price whether you want to keep it as it is or use the parts for your own creations, plus it has some nice playability.</p>

"Minifig290","2018-08-27T14:05:20.72Z","Great City Starter Pack","<p>Hello all, Today i&rsquo;ll be looking at the City&nbsp;Mountain Fugitives set that contains 88 pieces and retails for &pound;9.99 or $9.99 and is part of the Mountain Police sub theme&nbsp;for 2018</p>

<p>The 88 parts go into 3 builds and 4 minifigures along with a few accessories. Let&rsquo;s look at this set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>In this set you get a total of 4 minifigures; 2 Police officers and 2 Crooks.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a male&nbsp;officer&nbsp;who has some dark tan pants with 2 pockets m and his dark blue torso has a police logo and a shiny silver printed radio that continues to the back along with a brown utility belt. His face print is a simple chipper smiley and his helmet is just a white helmet with the usual trans brown cover on.</p>

<p>To go along with the male officer is his female colleague who uses the same legs a nice sand blue torso with the same radio and police logo print but also some pockets and a zip. Her back print has &ldquo;POLICE&rdquo; printed along with two other pockets. Her face print is a simple smiley with light pink lipstick and 1 eyebrow raised, but to finish her off is a great new for 2018 dual&nbsp;moulded&nbsp;hair hat combo. Her hat is in dark blue and has no print while her hair is in a darker orange colour.</p>

<p>Now the police are chasing after not one but two crooks. One of them is a fairly simple male robber who has plain dark gray legs and common stripped prison torso. His face print has a angry expression but is dual sided so also has a worried facial expression with 5 spots around his face. To finish the figure off is a common black long male hair piece.</p>

<p>His fellow crook is a female who has some unprinted olive&nbsp;green legs and a torso that shows her prison uniform covered by a red jacket with a pocket. Between her torso and head is a bag on her back that can carry some of her silken stuff. Her head shows her smirking and both eyebrows raised. Her hair is also a common hair part in a dark nougat.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>There are a few small minifig accessories such as two dark gray shovels for the crooks a black walkie&nbsp;talkie, a pair of light gray handcuffs and two pearl gold bars of gold.</p>

<p><strong>Builds</strong></p>

<p>Going from smallest to largest there are three builds a log, ATV and tree with landscape.</p>

<p>The log is a simple build that is used for the crooks to run from the scene of their crime via a river. It uses 3x 2x2 round brown bricks and has 4x 1x1 bricks with a stud on one side for the crooks to sit on. At the end of the build is a new 2x2 round tile with a wooden design printed.</p>

<p>The second build is a tree build with some minor landscaping. At the bottom of the tree there are some dark gray slopes for rocks on a 4x4 green plate surrounding two small brown window frames. The frames are covered by a small leave part that is attached to the build from a brick with technic hole with spin with stud that is then attached to a brown twig that then attached to the leave. The leave can move to expose the gap where you can hid or retreats two bars of gold. The tree it self is extremely simple just using 4x 2x2 round bricks in brown then a larger leave part that has a new for 2018 beehive mound in a orangey yellow colour. This piece has enough&nbsp;space at the bottom to go over a minifigs&nbsp;head without a hair piece.</p>

<p>Finally the ATV build is also simple having a handlebar for the police figs to control&nbsp;the ATV. At the front is a tow bar in black that is a new piece for 2018. There&rsquo;s a black 1x2 cheese-slope&nbsp;that is used as a backrest for the figure. Behind that there is a light on a telescope piece. Under that there is a clip to hold any of the accessories included. Next to that there is a small dark gray chain that can pull the log out the water.</p>

<p>_______________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To conclude this review i&rsquo;d say the figures are great and so are the builds but a minor complaint is that last year all City starter sets retailed for &pound;9 and now this retails for a whole pound more but it&rsquo;s such a minor complaint.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Figures, Accessories, Beehive and Golden Bars, Great Builds&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>None to mention</p>

"Zeke_Nitron","2018-08-27T03:17:21.593Z","Good pieces, good set","<p>Let me start off with my one complaint, the playability is minimal, you would need another Mountain Police set to play with this one. Anyway, the pieces are awesome; gold bars, beehive, log print and the hat and hair combo pieces are all standouts and the cheapest way to get them. I would recommend&nbsp;it especially&nbsp;if you build nature MOCs</p>
