"Jett_Pyre","2018-12-20T11:59:06.097Z","The Best Mountain Police Lego Set?","<p>This is probably one of the best Mountain Police Lego sets ever made. I like the use of new rock bricks and the tree piece for one of the prisoners and the mountain lion/cougar/puma, etc. The vehicle builds are average, two different helicopters, an atv and a motercycle. Two different side builds including a police helicoter landing platform and a little rock formation for hiding some gold bars. The main police station has a lot of stickers that are easy to put on and have nice designs. The net launcher is also very easy to use, you just fold the net into the front and pull back the trigger and push to launch the net. To me there&#39;s nothing really bad about this set as far as the price and what you get, but I do think that $90 for 663 pieces and 7 Minifigures is a little steep.</p>

<p>So buy it if it&#39;s on sale or on heavy clearance or discount</p>

<p>The build was very easy and enjoyable if you follow the instruction. There are multiple stickers in this set, however, most of them are for police signs, so I left most of them off.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>Other than the animal, there aren&#39;t many unique pieces in this set. I personally am very fond of the brown skeleton leg piece though.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>Crook with the tree trunk suit was the highlight of this set, however, by the time I&#39;m typing this review, this set is no longer the only set that comes with the tree trunk suit. Overall I&#39;m very happy with the minifigure choices for this set, I do hope that they could include some more hat or hair pieces so the figures can take off their helmets sometimes.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><label for=""ctl00_mainContent_reviewsadd_ValueForMoney"">Value for money</label></h2>

<p>There are a lot of big pieces in this set&nbsp;plus including an animal, so I think the price isn&#39;t too steep. Still, I would recommand buying it when there is a discount. I bought this set with a 30% discount because this set didn&#39;t sell well in my area, may be due to the fact that there&#39;s&nbsp;too many police sets and they show up every year.</p>

<h2>pros/cons list</h2>

<p>This list includes my playing experience.</p>

	<li>Multiple vehicles for play</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>Two many helicopters!</li>
	<li>The video camera and tool shack blocks the way of the staircase</li>
	<li>Play feature designed for the lion is not very useful</li>

</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>My opinion</h2>

<p>I actually like this set very much and grew even more fond of it over time. It does have multiple flaws here and there, but overall I think it is one of the more interesting ones amongst all of lego police headquarters. I would definitely recommand it, especially to children of targeted age range.&nbsp;</p>
