<p>I admit, I was not going to buy this set at first, because the helicopter looked so simple and small on the pictures and there was nothing that really attracted me (besides the fact, that it was a helicopter, of course). But then I had some money on my hands and got in some kind of LEGO buying spree. Shame on me. Since it was on a special discount - I got it for 31&euro; - I don&#39;t feel TOO bad about having bought it. The regular price of nearly 50&euro; is FAR too much!<br />
So here we go!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Standard parts for a small car and a helicopter, the usual cockpit-part, smaller rotor blades and a winch. A new part is the net-launcher, which is not really THAT hype like I imagined, but a nice gadget anyway. The hideout has some rock parts and a washing trough all with water(-bricks) and a brush! ;-D</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with four minifigures and a bear, which is quite a good amount for a set this size! We have two police officers, a female pilot and a male cop to launch himself from the chopper. We also have a male and female crook, with the bearded guy only in his undies, ready to take a bath! ;-D Unfortunately he got interrupted by the bear which I personally find most impressive! It is huge, massive and can stand on all fours and also only on its hind legs!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>All three parts of the set are very easy to build, should take some twenty minutes, especially when you follow the numbered bags.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I&#39;ll start with the car. Well, it&#39;s... a car. A buggy-like one. Looks speedy and all. It has a place to put the bag of loot in the back, though this does not look very trustworthy.<br />
The mountain-hideout is quite nice, because one would of course suspect the small hut to be the hideout. But the real deal is in a cave underneath it, where we find a small table with a map to plot the further escape route. The beehive is a nice addition explaining why the huge bear came to surprise the robbers in first place! The hut also has a small crane-like thing which looks a little odd and out of place...<br />
The helicopter itself is really not a big deal. Literally. It is quite small and does not have many functions or details, especially when compared to sets like the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4439-1/Heavy-Lift-Helicopter"">4439 Heavy Lift Helicopter</a>. It has a winch, which is oddly placed on top of its roof, the cockpit could not be more simple, the rest of the hull is completely empty, no additional gear or compartments. In the back is a small hatch, which I like, but is has no real use. Perhaps as an entrance for the captives? The double rotors are OK, but they lack some finishing part on the top. The net-launcher can be attached to either side of the helicopter and sticks out a little oddly.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>With great minifigures comes great playability! This modified quote could very well sum up this set! ;-) The three parts of the set are quite simple for themselves, but make a good combination for some nice playing. I think the helicopter could have used some more effort in design, especially its interior. Personally, the bear really got me! It looks so realistic and impressive! Also the guy in his pants is quite funny as has great potential for some nice stories!<br />
Clearly, this set is no must-have but it makes a great gift for the smaller ones. I would even recommend it as a good set to introduce your kid to LEGO, because of the many different minifigures and opportunities of play.</p>

"Your_Future_President","2018-12-29T17:00:51.22Z","A ""Bearable"" Set","<p>This specific build, although exclusive in this set, reflects many other sets that include a double rotor helicopter, which if you already have a one, this set might be one to pass.&nbsp; Even so it is in a new color as it has not been produced in mostly blue before (to the best of my knowledge). Otherwise, it is still an excellent set and one that offers many playing options.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures:</h2>

<p>The first figure that people like in this set seems to be the robber with no shirt, so I shall start there.&nbsp; He has a harry chest complete with a bear claw scar from a previous tussle.&nbsp; This figure is double sided with his bearded face snarling on one side and scared of the bear on the other.&nbsp; And of course his bear footprint underpants complete this figure.</p>

<p>The second robber is unfortunately not as exclusive as the first, as her hair and face are fairly common, and her outfit was just recently catapulted into several sets.&nbsp; She wears a red coat over her prison uniform.</p>

<p>The pilot, while featuring interesting body printing, wears a generic head with an overused white helmet.&nbsp; The printing features a uniform under a harness which can be used for many things.</p>

<p>The other officer wears a helmet, which also appeared in the CMS with the skater.&nbsp; He wears blue goggles which are very neat, but also can be found in the Arctic line.&nbsp; He also wears a harness as he is hanging out of the helicopter.</p>

<p>I will include the bear in this section, as he is not necessarily a build, but more a figure.&nbsp; This black bear is similar to the brown bear in the forest police theme a while back, except for the obvious color difference.&nbsp; It is of course the same mold as the polar bear from the Arctic line.</p>

<h2>Build:</h2>

<p>The off-roader is neat as it&#39;s shape allows for many uses.&nbsp; It is also very streamlined, as its red body fits only one minifigure.&nbsp; A bag of money can hang off the back.</p>

<p>The shack is an interesting build.&nbsp; It does not allow for very much play value as its compact size is difficult to get hands into.&nbsp; Nonetheless the bathtub is very ingenious, as the figure fits nicely in only if the transparent studs are put in <em>after</em> the figure is.&nbsp; The beehive is one of the highlights of this subtheme, as it can not only fit on the bottom of a structure as seen in the picture, but can also fit perfectly over the top of a minifigure&#39;s head for a bit of comedy.&nbsp; The crane function is quite useless and is basically just for decor.&nbsp; On the reverse side behind the rock piece is a hideout complete with a map.&nbsp; Again a little small for even small hands.</p>

<p>And now we have reached the helicopter.&nbsp; Double rotor helicopters such as this have appeared often in the ongoing police line, so are not uncommon, but this being a distinct color from the usual white has caught my attention.&nbsp; Inside the cockpit there is room for one minifigure or two if you force things.&nbsp; To my dismay another cannot fit anywhere else without the removal of pieces of the helicopter or the figure&#39;s hat, which is somewhat disappointing.&nbsp; The net shooter function, although quite hyped up, is somewhat dissatisfactory as well, but is about as good as flick-fire missiles or the failed super-jumper.&nbsp; One must pull it back until a click is heard in order to fit the whole net inside.&nbsp; The back hatch of the copter opens up to allow cargo, or with the removal of some pieces, a figure.&nbsp; The rotors turn marvelously, but if the yellow stickers are not spaced equally, the rotors--when spun--create a discontinuity which hurts my head.&nbsp; The winch works as well as any other winch does, so no comment.</p>

<h2>Verdict:</h2>

<p>This is a lovely set, and one with several good pieces, such as the bear and robber with no shirt.&nbsp; The price, however, seems a bit steep when compared to the piece count, so I recommend trying to find it on sale.&nbsp; Otherwise, buy away!</p>

Unfortunately, my bear has a loose head! It&#39;s quite wobbly in the joint where it meets the body. The back legs seem to be attached just fine. I thought I&#39;d put that out there since I haven&#39;t seen anyone else have this problem. This is the only instance where I&#39;ve ever requested a replacement part from Lego, which they were happy to do.</p>
