<p>Mountain river heist is a great set that for the price (&pound;) was a great value . The sets builds interact with each other as a sort of story. So I will review it in chronological order.</p>

<p>The Minifigures-</p>

<p>But before the builds the minifigures are quite nice two criminals a security guard and a police pilot . Accessorys for figures include a pair of handcuffs , a chainsaw and a very nice black crow bar .</p>

<p>The builds-</p>

<p>&nbsp;The story starts with the bank truck with the essential golden ingots . It would be driving up a mountain path . The build ( diverting from the narrative temporarily ) is very nice with an interior for the driver to be seated and enough space for the payload in the back . The roof features two very nice 4&times;6 green plate tile pieces and the hood and below are nicely deatailed . Next I the story we need the tree to be cut down by the chainsaw and bring the truck to a hault . This build whilst most likely the weakest is still nice and does its job but undoubtedly the best part of the tree is the bed nice element . Thirdly in the story is the criminals six wheeled vehicle which pulls up to the back of the back of the crashed truck and used its grappling book to secure and remove the gold . The build is roofless and has a nice seating area for the driver as well as a spacious slot for the cargo . In addition there are two clips for the crow bar and chainsaw , a nice headlight set up and a low down windshield . Lastly there is the police plane wmuch captures the crooks and returns the gold . The build has a cramped interior and a long wing span with the tail fin&nbsp;being stickered . The most interesting part of this build is the net launcher which not working perfectly is an appreciated add on . In conclusion this is one of my personal favorite city sets just behind the 2011 harbor , the 2018 hospital and the 2010 lego truck .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>I would recommend this fans like me who appreciate the deeper narrative behind sets you would not expect .</p>
