"Minifig290","2018-02-11T14:03:15.623Z","Good For Racing Car Lovers","<p>I got this set obtain the free hot dog cart stand and to be honset with you i was rather disappointed&nbsp;with this set, though it does have some good parts.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The racing car driver is alright, its nice to see that Octan torso piece return in a cheap set. The face print isn&#39;t to exciting nor is the figures hat or legs.</p>

<p><b>The Main Build</b></p>

<p>As a racing car goes it could be worse. The cockpit for the figure is the best part as it uses a Speed Champions window piece and fits the figure in quite well. The two jets are oversized and the flames coming out of them are useless in my eyes. There are six sticker in this set which is reasonable, the most useful of which are the ones on the tail of the racer.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pieces</strong></p>

<p>There are a total of 78 parts that means the price per part is 10.2p/ 12.8c which is a little bit pricey but you do get some larger pieces like the windscreen, the two jets and flames and also the Speed Champions car base in black.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>In total i think this set is worth passing on and there are better &pound;8-&pound;10 sets in the market currently to buy like the Star Wars Millennium Falcon Micro Fighter. The only valuable part of this set are the pieces and maybe the figure.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-</strong>&nbsp;Minifigure, Windscreen piece and some of the stickers</p>

<p><strong>Cons-</strong>&nbsp;Lack of good play features and is oversized</p>

No special functions, no surprises, just basic LEGO. But, and that was my main reason to buy it: the revival of the Octan-theme!! Yay to the memories!!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>No surprises here, standard LEGO parts. The two rocket drives are quite massive, maybe a little too large for this small model...<br />
I like the new windshield, haven&#39;t had one of those before.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>One minifigure , with nice Octan design! Brings back memories, everything OK with that.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Easy, easy, 10 minutes tops. Since there are no functions to the model, it&#39;s a simple, straightforward build.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It looks quite good, even though the two booster rockets seem a little oversized. They would fit a larger model, like the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6580-1/Land-Jet-7"">6580 Land-Jet.</a> The amount of stickers is OK, they fit nicely to the overall picture.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Well, what did you expect? There is not much to this model, except its look. And even this has flaws because of the oversized boosters. I like the overall design, but the regular price of almost 10&euro; is waaay too high in my opinion. So, if you&#39;re not a total nostalgic like me, this might be a nice little gift for the younger ones, but not more.</p>

IMHO it is a fair representation of a land speed record car: vertical sabilizer, large jet engines, low to the ground... The build is quick and easy, applying the stickers properly takes up about as much time as building the car itself. Personally I think the stickers add a lot to the looks of the car and are appropriate to the model.</p>

<p>There are - unfortunately - some off-colour pieces that are quite visible but due to their location not too distraction. Still, a shame and IMHO completely unnecessary. I am a fan of the flame jet-exhaust pieces.</p>

<p>The minifigure itself is not bad, though I would have liked to see a second face print, for instance of the driver after he has set the record - now he is merely sweating in anticipation. The torso print IMHO is stellar in its simplicity.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is an OK set for 10 euros. There are some big pieces (tail, flames, canopy, engine) and a nice minifigure. That said, the car is small and has limited play value - unless you want to have it crash in one of your scenarios. Though the car is surprisingly sturdy. If you can still find it, you could still consider picking it up.</p>

"Krutak","2022-07-11T11:59:44.687Z","Speed Record Car: Compact, but too small","<p>Speed Record Car is really cool set. Design of minifigure&nbsp;and car is interesting, but i think that little more accessories will not hurt it. Mini pit stop, finish gate or even octane barrel - anything, but small! Detail under bumper is not very reliable, but overall - it&#39;s cool set. It&#39;s compact and easy to bring while travelling.</p>
