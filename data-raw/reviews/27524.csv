<p>Just like dolls need a dollhouse, Minidolls need a &quot;Mini-dollhouse&quot;. In that regard, the Friendship House delivers! If you&#39;re interested in&nbsp;collecting the reboot-era sets, this is a good place to start. There&#39;s a lot of variety in the accessories, and the set is a good value for the money. The building process was a refreshing departure from what I&#39;m used to, with different building techniques. Having said all this, while the Friendship House&nbsp;has plenty of play value on its own,&nbsp;it IS meant to go with the Mission Vehicle, hence a rating of 4 under &quot;Playability&quot;. If you can find this set, I recommend picking it up. And if it&#39;s&nbsp;for a good price, even better.</p>
