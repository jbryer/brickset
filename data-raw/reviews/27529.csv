<p>This affordable set was surprise me in many ways on how good it looks, and the value of the parts are decent enough for my own parts collection.</p>

<p>The wheels are super attractive and not in my knowledge that this has appear on a technic set before, which is quite fresh for me since I collect technic only and it enlighten me some new&nbsp;idea for my own moc.</p>

<p>The match of colors are pleasant enough, given on how small this set is, it has fairly good size and it does it jobs really well for sweeping your piles of bricks away.</p>
