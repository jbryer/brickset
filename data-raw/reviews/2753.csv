<p>BASIC can be considered as the CREATOR theme of times long past. It offered a bunch of different bricks and an instruction manual that provided instructions for a variety&nbsp;of different models. The main purpose of these basic sets was to sparkle the creativity of young children and to show them that you could do and built anything with LEGO, you simply had to imagine it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bricks in this set are...well...euhm...basic:&nbsp;bricks, plates, windows and roof-tiles in the common basic (sorry) LEGO&nbsp;colors: red, blue, white, black&nbsp;and yellow. The best thing&nbsp;here is that apart form these basic (euhm...you are getting the point, right :P ) bricks we also get a couple of wheels, 2 minifigures (a girl with the now rare but still amazing pony-tale hairpiece), some flowers, windscreen and a tree. It opens a world of possibilities.</p>

<p>With these bricks we can create a nice selection of builds: a series of houses, a boat, a car, a plane, a horse and cart, a truck and some interior furniture. There is no real theme that connects the builds, instead the different models are all over the place and that is a good thing! Again: it is a perfect way to show the possibilities&nbsp;of this&nbsp;building toy.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say anything bad about this set. Not even if I wanted to. Sure, it isn&#39;t up to par with the LEGO&nbsp;sets these days. There is very limited choice in type of bricks and color, but &nbsp;you have to keep in mind that this set is almost 35 years old and that it was and is intended for very young kids. It teaches&nbsp;them the kicks and tricks of building with LEGO. It is an introduction, a gateway to another world, a portal to LEGO-addiction.</p>

<p>Probably nostalgia is also getting the better of me while writing this review but still: how can this not be worth 5 stars? <em>&quot;Just Imagine&quot;</em> and with that, I rest my case...</p>
