<p><strong>Packaging &amp; Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Most of the box is a striking gloss black and the model appears bold against the back ground. Included in the set are instructions for both the A and B models in two separate booklets. They are easy to follow and besides following the new package decoration on the covers are standard technic fair.</p>

<p><strong>Parts &amp; Build</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe there are any new parts in this set, certainly not any exciting ones but this would make an excellent basic parts pack full of good, general, useful beams, pins and wheels- I reckon it&#39;s got good C-model potential. This is the cheapest and smallest set this year, in a price slot sadly lacking in last year&#39;s line-up. As such one would expect a simple beginner build, those people will find that but fret not seasoned builders, you too will be rewarded with some fun techniques.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Model &amp; Functions</strong></p>

<p>Upon completion I was pleasantly surprised by how handsome the finished model is, the striking colour scheme&nbsp;and most excitingly, no stickers! The hook loading function&nbsp;works well with some friction added through the use of extra gears and pin types, the truck looks a little awkward without the bucket portion but this is only a small gripe. The steering works well too however the turning circle is quite large and this is where it lost a point- this I feel is an issue for many&nbsp;technic vehicles.</p>

<p>In summary, this is good solid small technic set and definitely worth the $12 gamble.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a side note, remove the pins to the rear of the 3 long beam on either side of the cab and the model gets opening doors!</p>

<p>I build this with pieces from my collection. Its a nice little truck that actually&nbsp;turned out bigger than I thought. From my point of view, it has two &quot;mechanisms&quot;- the steering and the hook loading. The hook loading works well, but only works on hard surfaces.</p>

<p><strong>The Build-</strong></p>

<p>The build is pretty simple and took me less than 15 minutes to build. It starts with the front and steering, than the rear and cab. Finally, you build the container.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-</strong></p>

<p>Great value!</p>

<p>Working functions</p>

<p><strong>Cons-</strong></p>

<p>B model isn&#39;t to good looking</p>

<p>the rear doesn&#39;t look very good&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall-</strong></p>

<p>This set is a really good value($15) for the amount of pieces, and is a good first technic set. I would totally give this as a gift to someone who has never done technic before.&nbsp;</p>
