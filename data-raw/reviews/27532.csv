"Marlon8000","2018-01-06T21:17:06.457Z","We've got a little old Convoy...","<p>Today I am going to build the 42078 Mack Anthem. And since it has not been reviewed yet I figured to do so during building... My opinions on this set&nbsp;are not objective since I grew up with rigs, and the Mack&nbsp;has always been one&nbsp;of the icons in that history... So, simply because it is a Mack, and it looks good on the box,&nbsp;to me it&#39;s already awesome...Let&#39;s roll...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Box:</strong></p>

<p>It is a regular box, nothing fancy this time, sealed with the transparent pieces of tape. Not really important, since I don&#39;t save them.</p>

<p>The front of the box shows the Mack Anthem and its trailer&nbsp;(A-model) from a front left view. The supports of the crane on the trailer are extended, and the container is lifted a little off of&nbsp;the trailer. In the top-right corner is a side-view&nbsp;picture to indicate the length of the Mack and it&#39;s trailer, and the bottom right corner has the Mack logo. Age 11-16, hmm... I turn 42 in 2 weeks :-)</p>

<p>The back of the box shows both A and B model with explanation of their functionalities, in 8 different languages. The B model is some sort of garbage truck that is also a Mack. It seems like a pretty cool build, but&nbsp;I never cared much for B models.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Content:</strong></p>

<p>Inside the box, there are several loose bags, and&nbsp;a white box. Inside the white box there are more bags, and 4 loose tyres without rims. All in all there are about 20 bags numbered 1 to 7 and 4 loose tyres.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Overall the set has great parts. Lots of several different panels. Actuators are always good, so are wheels, but what jumps right in the eye is that this (Technic) set has a lot of studded bricks.</p>

<p>New to me is the 1x2 sloped tile which is sawn off at a corner... cool, but most interesting part is ofcourse&nbsp;the Mack hood ornament&nbsp;&nbsp;:-)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The build:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bags 1</strong></p>

<p>With the parts from bags numbered 1 you will build the backside of the Macks chassis. it is pretty much what you expect, with the double diff&nbsp; (<em>Make sure both the diff gears are placed correctly, I had my back axles spinning in opposite direction). </em>The&nbsp;dish&nbsp;where the trailer lays on has a nifty locking&nbsp;system, Im curious to see how that works with the trailer. The backside looks pretty cool with it&#39;s rear lights positioned in the middle, and the license plate just a little left of centre...&nbsp;The backside also requires&nbsp;some stickering. 4 orange reflectors, the license plate and the word &quot;MACK&quot; on both of&nbsp;the mudflaps. One thing&nbsp;that disappoints a little,&nbsp;is that the 2 back axles only have one tyre on each side... Should be two, but that can be a good mod after it is finished.</p>

<p><strong>Bags 2</strong></p>

<p>Now the front-end of the chassis will come alive. It begins as a separate build that later&nbsp;connects to&nbsp;the backside. at first it is&nbsp;just clicking together some beams and pins, but pretty fast, when building the steering axle, you see the mechanism that turns the wheel in the cabin when you steer the model... The whole steering mechanism is great, it has a lever for horizontal movement&nbsp;and that makes for very light steering.Not like the Mercedes Benz Arocs...&nbsp;Another cool feature is the engine which has a crankshaft and 6&nbsp;&nbsp;cylinders on top that jump when the model rolls... I do like the fact that for this set, LEGO decided to not use the standard engine parts with the yellow pistons. It is cool to see something different for a change...&nbsp;Now the chassis is finished, It rolls smooth and the turning circle is smaller as I expected...&nbsp;already a great build :-)</p>

<p><strong>Bags 3</strong></p>

<p>All bags marked &quot;3&quot; hold the parts&nbsp;for building&nbsp;the cabin... Basically the rest of the tractor except for the hood and the front bumper. It starts with the bed, gastanks, and the seats... The bed and seats (made out of regular studded LEGO) are pretty cool and the headrests of the seats have the word &quot;MACK&quot; on them by means of a sticker. The&nbsp;covers of the gastanks have cool steps in it (the steps to the cabin), and the paneling of the sleeping cab are very sturdy and with the cabin doors, it&nbsp;looks great with the side stickering... A nice detail is that the right-side cabin door has an opening where&nbsp;the real Mack has a window... Once the dashboard/windshield/top cover assembly&nbsp;is done -which goes in a very nice flow in the instructions- the thing starts to get it&#39;s shape... The steering mechanism&nbsp;is complete and has a nice feature: The instructions say to mount a black cog on the back of the cab to steer the wheels, but also, an actual steering wheel&nbsp;underneath the roof of the cab, in case you would prefer instead of the cog. I went for the steering wheel and put the cog underneath the roof. The roof opens by pulling it upwards on the back, it locks with only 2 pins, and&nbsp;it opens like the hood of a car. The side panels of the top of the cabin are pointing to the inside a little which gives the cab a streamlined look. The backside of the cabin is quite detailed with the side skirts, 2 vertical exhausts and 2 crossbars... The antennas on top of the rear-view mirrors give the rig a real badass look...&nbsp;Awesome build so far :-)</p>

<p><strong>Bags 4</strong></p>

<p>Bags four will be the front end of the Anthem. The bumper is first, with nice use of those corner panels with stickers that have the round fog-lights on them. Sloped&nbsp;2x1 tiles&nbsp;are used for the bottom edge... 2 sloped 1x2 tiles and 2 flat 1x2 tiles in chrome&nbsp;to form the 2 vertical strips,&nbsp;and the license plate in the middle...&nbsp;&nbsp;The hood is a sub build and forms a rigid frame with the top and the front, the side&nbsp;covers&nbsp;are assemblies&nbsp;that&nbsp;are&nbsp;mounted by an axle. On the side covers there is also a grill assy that uses a sawn-off sloped 1x2 tile which I haven&#39;t seen before... The fenders and the front are mostly build out of studded bricks, just like the headlight assemblies. And like the bumper, the front of the hood has the same chrome&nbsp;strips upwards with 2 chrome printed&nbsp;1x3 tiles&nbsp;with he details of a Mack grill. The chrome 1x4 tile with the Mack letters on the front is also a printed part... The chrome strips are topped off with a sloped 1x2 tile... Chrome parts always look beautiful when brand new :-). The hood opens on 2 turning points, this way you can position the front of the hood on top of the bumper. And finally, the best detail on this model, the Mack hood ornament. It comes in a golden colour, and has an axle for mounting.&nbsp;&nbsp; The finished tractor looks amazing, the panels close very well onto each other.</p>

<p>On with the trailer :-)</p>

<p><strong>Bags 5</strong></p>

<p>Building the trailer starts with the inside frame, a little gear assembly of which I do not know what it is going to do at this point, and the mechanism to lower the trailers stands. The stands are operated by the black cog sticking out of the left-side of the trailer. It uses a lever mechanism, and works pretty well. The frame is build like a tunnel of panels, but once finished, it is a very sturdy and lightweight construction... Especially the part of the trailer that is on the tractor, in the picture it seems like it could sag, but no, it is sturdy enough. It also has the &quot;hooks&quot; where the container needs to be positioned... The green panels on the side...Yep, looks like a real container trailer, and it fits the anthem great :-)&nbsp;I mentioned this earlier, the axles on the trailer also have single tyres... For the trailer I don&#39;t mind as much as on the Anthem... What would be a cool mod is to add an axle, and maybe make one retractable.</p>

<p><strong>Bags 6</strong></p>

<p>Bags 6 allow you to build the crane onto the trailer. Things will get a bit more technical, and I always love green parts :-)&nbsp; The crane is actually 2 cranes which are operated simultaneously. You build 2 cranes that are mirrored from each other, and connect to the earlier mentioned gear assembly. The 2 parts of the crane operate independent from each other... 2 cogs on the back of the trailer operate the crane, one cog for the bottom parts of the crane, and one cog for the top parts... The two stability stands are operated by a lever per stand (each has it&acute;s own lever). And last, there are 4 separate chains to hook on to the container. building the cranes go pretty fast, it is cleverly designed also with the stability stand, and even though you build 2 of basically the same things, it was not boring to do the second one...&nbsp;I kinda hoped both movements of the crane would go simultaneously, but lets see how it goes when the container is build.&nbsp;&nbsp;It already looks very cool with the booms fully extended and the chains hanging...</p>

<p><strong>Bags 7</strong></p>

<p>Parts for the container are in the bags marked `7`. Building it is pretty straight forward, hooking up a lot of panels for the bottom, top, sidewalls and the back. The doors both have a vertical rod with a handle to lock the door like containers have, and all in all it is a solid build, and with some stickers it is not a bad container</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>Wonderful... Awesome,..this is such a great set. It is a model after a `famous`real life truck, and with the crane on the trailer, it also has the technical challenge a good Technic set needs. What I also really like is&nbsp;that this set has a huge&nbsp;amount of studded bricks. which also show in the details. Too bad it is not with power functions, or at least prepped for...</p>

<p>The Mack looks very realistic which&nbsp;gets extra noticeable&nbsp;when you Google for an image of the real Anthem... spitting image. The trailer is light and sturdy. Very well designed, but when you want to hoist the container off of it, you really need the stability stands, otherwise the trailer tips over (which adds to realism)... Truck and trailer combined looks very impressive, and realistic, both the Anthem and the trailer.</p>

<p>I see now why both movements of the crane are not simultaneous, first the top of the crane lifts the container off of the trailer, then the bottom of the crane puts it next to the trailer till about an inch&nbsp;(2.5cm) from the ground, then the top part lowers it all the way... And I guess in real life, such a crane has similar movements as this one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>It rolls, it steers. so no problem there.&nbsp;One of the great&nbsp;things about this truck is that you can hook and unhook the trailer like a real life rig does. Put down the stands, unlock the trailer, and drive the truck away. Other way around the same.&nbsp; For picking up or dropping off the container, it works the same... Two knobs (cogs) on the back of the trailer, let you load or unload the box. So that&acute;s already good playability.</p>

<p>The Anthem can also be towed by the 420008 Service truck. Or modify the container so it can carry a small car or some other load. The trailer also has mod potential, like mentioned earlier, a 3rd axle and make one retractable... One mod&nbsp;I am going to do is to fit all back axles with extra tyres :-)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Apart from the single wheel thingy and the lack of PF, it is an awesome set in all its ways. Very good display- and playability options.&nbsp;LEGO did a great job, and&nbsp;this one&nbsp;will fit in very well&nbsp;with the rest of my fleet of Lego trucks</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Should I get this or not</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as&nbsp;stated&nbsp;before, my opinion cannot be seen as objective. This is definitely a set you should have, beautiful model,&nbsp;lots of great parts.&nbsp;And for 6 cents a part, it is not too expensive at all...</p>

<p>So... YESSSS!!!!!!</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-02-18T19:23:02.033Z","WOW! It might have surpassed first impressions.","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I hope I can be somewhat objective in this review, but it will be a challenge. I am in the very lucky position to be able to compare this set to the likes of Ninjago&nbsp;City (70620), Destiny&#39;s Bounty (70618) and the Temple of Airjitzu (70751) as I am in the very fortunate position that these sets are part of my collection. The Mack Anthem is of that quality, and might surpass them as the&nbsp;favourite set&nbsp;in my collection. I think one can argue that it is among the greatest Technic sets ever (if not the greatest), having seen the likes of the Volvo Wheel loader (42030), Porsche 911 (42056), Bucket Wheel Excavator (42055)&nbsp;and Mobile Crane Mk II (42009) in person.</p>

<p>The Mack Anthem is massive (almost 90 cm / 3 ft long), looks awesome (especially the truck). From a slight distance and at first glance it does not look like a Lego truck, but more like a plastic or metal model. The designer made extremely good use of the shapes available in Technic and regular Lego pieces. The&nbsp;mixture of &quot;regular&quot; Lego and parts from the Technic range. When you buy this set, get some Windex, as there are many stickers (often in highly visible places) that need to be lined up correctly (for instance the sides of the cabin).</p>

<p>The build takes a while; I had&nbsp;about 8 hours or so&nbsp;of building fun, which allows you to slowly see the truck come into existence. I had intended to build one bag a day (at the end of the day), but once started it became pretty much impossible to stop building until the set was completed.&nbsp;The mechanism to (un)load the container works well, and runs smoothly. There is little to criticize as far as the design is concerned.</p>

<p>If you like the looks (or trucks in general), this is a set worth saving for.&nbsp;In short, I would highly recommend this set, even at RRP. IMHO, in looks and bang for buck it blows the other Technic sets mentioned above out of the water, and is on par with the likes of Destiny&#39;s Bounty (from the Ninjago Movie range). BTW, having built the truck, I can definitely see why the age range is given as 11+, it is not the easiest set to put together.</p>

<h2>Building experience</h2>

<p>Where to start - probably with the big box, and the many bags (20 total, numbered 1 to 7) it contains. The manual is massive, and so is the sticker sheet (54 total, numbered 1 to 35)&nbsp;It gives you some idea what challenge lays ahead. Take your time, and keep your wits about you. Somewhere I missed installing a small part from bags 3, as I found out when looking at the spare parts remaining. And I have no idea where I missed installing it.</p>

<p>Bags 1 to 4 (11 bags in total) contain the parts for the truck. One starts building the chassis (rear, then front in separate parts, which are connected at the end of bag 2). On occasion it is a challenge to correctly line up the pins and long bars used to connect (and strengthen) the structure. The steps are logical, the first stickers need to be installed, and the first &#39;regular&#39; Lego parts are installed (rear fender, engine). Bags 3 contain the parts for the cab, which looks awesome, thanks to the designer deciding to use &#39;regular&#39; Lego and stickers to flesh out the interior. The one thing to pay attention to is the construction of the front axles (of the steering wheel), as they might jam a little against&nbsp;the frame of the chassis) when turning the front wheels from left steering to right steering. Installing the head lights and the engine hood is somewhat tricky.</p>

<p>The trailer is built with bags 5 and 6 (6 bags in total) - the trailer itself using the parts in bag 5, the cranes for loading and unloading uses the parts in bag 6). The trailer is an easy build, though sometimes lining up pins and&nbsp;long bars is tricky). The cranes are more tricky, though the well thought out steps help you along nicely. Properly attaching the cranes to the trailer was the biggest problem I encountered, due to me misreading the manual.</p>

<p>Bags 7 contain the parts for the container. This is an easy build - by far the easiest of all in this set. The container itself is big, bigger than I thought it would be.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Awesome, massive, lovely, impressive, center piece of your collection worthy.</p>

<p>The best part is the truck, which by itself would have made a good model (and set). I think the designer has done an awesome job, and just about made every right decision he could make. Choosing to use &quot;regular&quot; Lego to create the seats, dashboard, headlights and bed, the colour scheme, not using standard technic cylinders to recreate the engine... it is about as good as it gets. Due to the odd shapes and angles of the exterior truck, there are some gaps, but these are minor. The design of the steering mechanism is great. In some ways the fairly extensive use of &#39;regular&#39; Lego in this set reminds me of the Technic sets of the 1980&#39;s and early 1990&#39;s, where this was the norm.</p>

<p>There are a few minor nit-picks:&nbsp;First, apparently the rear-tyres ought to be double wheel (rather than single as they are now), and second, I think the steering mechanism (front wheel axles) could have been done maybe differently to prevent any jamming when steering. That said, the designer has done an awesome job of covering up the brightly coloured&nbsp;axles and bushings in this set.</p>

<p>The trailer (and container) are quite impressive as well, but not up to the same standard as the truck itself. Much of it has to do with reasons - presumably - beyond the set designer&#39;s control, and that is the decision by the Lego company to use different (bright) colours for various axles, bushings and cogs. I am not much of a fan for the tan and blue used for some of the pins, and brown for some of the axles. The bright yellow axles and bright red axles, cogs and bushings are a major eyesore (and IMHO should be done away with ASAP, back to the gray and black!). And where these could be covered up in the truck, that is simply impossible for the trailer and the cranes.&nbsp;Now you are left with a beautiful green, white and black dominated colour scheme, with some yellow and red dots popping through. Ugh!</p>

<p>The mechanism to stabilize the trailer and load and unload the container works well - although the gear ratio means that it takes quite a few turns of the two cogs operating the crane before the container is (un)loaded.</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>To me, this is a display model than can be played with. Yes, the truck can be steered, rides smoothly, the trailer can be (un)hitched through a clever mechanism&nbsp;and the container can be (un)loaded but the play functions are limited. There is little in this scale to interact with in play. I would say it comes closer to a demonstration model than a play model.</p>

<p>The truck (and trailer) can also serve as an inspiration for many mods - especially trailer designs to hitch to the truck.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>First impressions when this set was introduced were overwhelmingly positive, it seems. Expectations were high. For me the set&nbsp;jumped to the top of my wish-list, and became the only Technic set on it. Having built it, this set has surpassed those expectations.</p>

<p>As said in the summary, an awesome set, and IMHO one of the best sets if not the best Technic set&nbsp;ever. And even though cross-theme comparison is difficult, I think it is arguably among the top sets within the whole Lego range of the past few years. From what sets I have seen released for 2018, IMHO it is the run&nbsp;away winner for set of the year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For my own collection, looking at bang-for-buck, this rendition of the Mack truck is&nbsp;equal to the&nbsp;Ninjago Movie Destiny&#39;s Bounty (and thus top of the list).</p>

<p>If you like trucks, or big massive Technic sets in general, this IMHO would be the one set to get. IMHO in looks it offers more bang for buck than many others (like the Porsche 911 or Volvo Wheel Loader). It is worth saving for. So is taking your time building it, first of all to just enjoy the building itself, but also to properly attach the many stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I honestly hope that Lego will keep this set in production for quite a while, which would allow&nbsp;as many people as possible to save for this set (and stores to restock when it has sold out).&nbsp;</p>

"jdm","2018-06-18T13:45:36.74Z","This set is MASSIVE","<p>There are already a couple of other reviews here on the Brickset, but I wanted to add another one from a different perspective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Firstly I am not a Technic aficionado and this is the first Technic set i have bought since the Porsche (which i like but don&rsquo;t love).&nbsp; When the Mack was released I have to admit that it intrigued me but it was not necessarily a set that I thought I would buy.&nbsp; But after seeing it at a reasonable discount I took the plunge&hellip;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>I am not engineering-oriented so cannot really go into detail about the workings of the model (i had to look up &lsquo;actuator&rsquo; !!), but from an emotional, purely building perspective this was a very satisfying and pleasurable build. &nbsp;</p>

<p>By the end of bag 2 you have the core chassis made up and the steering mechanism in place for the rig. For me it was hugely reminiscent of my childhood when i received the 8860 Car Chassis for my 11th birthday. &nbsp; As then, I was joyfully pushing he Mack along the table top and doing 12 point turns (or more!!) to turn it around. It is here that you start to get an idea of just how big this set is - it is HUGE!&nbsp; Just the rig measures over 35 cm long.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bags 3 &amp; 4 build out the rig to its conclusion.&nbsp; I really enjoyed the fact that there is a fair amount of system parts that are used to give form and detail to the model.&nbsp; The designers have done a really good job using a few of the most recent new system parts to shape and create angles and curves that really add to the look.&nbsp; It looks fabulous. The detail is incredible.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll be thinking, Dual, Smokey &amp; the Bandit, and humming &lsquo;convoy&rsquo; !!!&nbsp; I actually stopped here to take a break and thought &ldquo;shall i actually build the trailer? do I need one? who cares, i&rsquo;ve got a monstrous, awesome truck. Job done!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But there is still a pile of bags to go after the rig is complete&hellip;.</p>

<p>So on to the trailer. Whilst the build is not complicated it does keep you interested as to how it is all going to pull together.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s only once you start assembling the lifting mechanisms (there are 2) and attaching them that it all starts to work and you finally see it all.&nbsp; The colours are fun too and a change to the black and grey used up to now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The container is a very quick and uncomplicated build but really completes the model.&nbsp; Some might say just give me the truck/cab but actually this second piece really complements the truck and shows off the entire Mack Anthem in all its glory (and size) which I think is necessary. &nbsp; Whilst the winch mechanism is a bit slow it is very precise and satisfying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only minor gripe i have is an aesthetic one.&nbsp; Visible blue or LBG pins do annoy when they could easily be a black or DBG recolour, but this applies to other sets too (in particular the recent Ultimate Hulkbuster i recently built).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>This set is terrific value for money - over 2500 parts at &lsquo;only&rsquo; circa 5p a part at full RRP, so if you can find it discounted it really is worth it.&nbsp; There is a wide range of technic and system pieces that will lend themselves to your MOCs. The box and resulting model are enormous and really leave you thinking that you have got a bargain&hellip;..and it looks fantastic.&nbsp; I know there is debate about whether Technic models should remain open/uncovered to allow us to see inside but the lines of the Mack are just done so well.&nbsp; The bonnet lifts so you can see inside, whilst the container lift mechanism is totally visible -&nbsp;Best of both worlds!</p>

"legomandre42082","2018-09-18T15:52:57.657Z","Mack Daddy of all Trucks!","<h2><strong>Proper display piece and play set!</strong></h2>

<p>The Mack Truck is an essential piece of any Lego Technic enthusiasts collection. This model is exceptionally intricate and provides a statement when it sits on the shelf at your home. In addition, the set exhibits many incredible functions that make the owner prideful when it drives around your home. The immense size of the product creates many smiles and awes when it is moving through the city. Every person will want to have a seat in this great vehicle.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What I enjoyed about the set:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The building process of this model was very fluid and incredibly enjoyable. The piece count may have shocked some individuals (around 2600 pieces!), however, the Lego Technic group made it very slick to construct the model in such a way, that the builder was able to see the sheer complexity of the vehicle at every step. Bags 1-4 allowed the builder to see the true beauty of the main truck, with all its moving parts, while 5-7 demonstrated the versatility of the trailer, with the very few amount of pieces needed to develop the powerful hydraulics.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Power Functions are not necessary with the flawlessness of the various functions. Though some may have liked to take a step back and remotely control the power of the vehicle, using the manual functionality created a sense of happiness&nbsp;that many PF sets lack at times. Using the manual functions, the builder can truly understand how a vehicle properly works and not let technology take the wheel, pun intended.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What I disliked&nbsp;about the set:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The one negative aspect regarding the set was the trailer. Though the main build of the truck was immensely detailed and gorgeous, the trailer severely lacked in its overall accuracy. I have done much research on various trailers made by Mack, and not one photo shows the support hydraulics on the side, as with this set. Semi trailers are not meant to lower or raise cargo on their own, they need another crane to guarantee the load is not harmed in th process. They only drive the cargo around, so the set lacks the authenticity due to that part.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Would I recommend this set?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>The Mack Anthem is the quintessential Lego set for any die-hard Technic collector. It symbolizes the intricate nature of all Technic models, yet it has lifelike functionality that brings out the mini-engineer in all Lego Technic builders. Though the price may be steep at $180, it pays dividends in the hours of fun after constructing this exceptional model. I would highly recommend this set for any person interested in Lego Technic.&nbsp;</p>
