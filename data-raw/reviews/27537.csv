"Odeinoichus","2018-03-30T19:47:21.997Z","The Last Bricktober features some great Minifigures.","<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Set #5004939 The LEGO Batman Movie Minifigure Collection:</span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;""> With Toy&rsquo;s-R-Us closing it fills my heart with sorrow as I review, what will most likely be, the last Bricktober offering I will ever get. Granted Canada&rsquo;s branch is looking to be bought by someone to continue operations as usual, but I am uncertain if they will continue their partnership with LEGO for Bricktober exclusives like this.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">That being said this was the only one I could get this past year (2017), while I had an interest in the others I just couldn&rsquo;t afford at the time. And this one, in my eyes, was the most desirable because it includes four more Batman suits for your LEGO Batman collection.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Box</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Much like the Minifigure Collections of the past, this packaging is a slide out tray style box with an inner tray that holds the Minifigures quite nicely. It&rsquo;s a yellow coloured box to match the style of The LEGO Batman Movie theme. It is what it is and that&rsquo;s pretty much it, great for removing the figures and displaying them or returning them eventually to the package for a decent display.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Minifigures</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Baturion: Here is Baturion, Batman in his Roman Soldier styled outfit, which features an awesome Bat print shield, a dark roman helmet, a golden short sword. He includes a soft-cape in maroon colours and a very detailed print showing some dark armour with a bat symbol and some great dual-molded legs. Baturion is an awesome Minifigure and a great addition to your LEGO Batsuit collection from The LEGO Batman Movie.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Dollar Bill Tuxedo Batman: This is another of the fun tuxedoes we saw in the film during the Tuxedo Trying on Scene. He doesn&rsquo;t have a cape with this one of course, but he does feature some great printing with dollar bills all over the front, back and side of his torso and legs. He includes a LEGO 100 dollar bill accessory and that&rsquo;s it. I don&rsquo;t find this suit to be the biggest draw of the set, but it is a nice figure.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Easter Bunny Batman: Holy Egg-Hunts Batman, what is he wearing? This is one of the oddest off-the-wall ideas for a Batsuit ever, but it&rsquo;s so awesome. The figure is all in light-blue, he has a white accessory belt and a light-blue helmet piece featuring the bunny ears from the CMF Series. Included with him is a pink basket and a blue egg, by all means this is one of the best looking figures from the set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Wizbat: Mythological Batman, that&rsquo;s pretty much what you get here and this Minifigure looks great. Wearing a robe of dark blue with a light blue under robe, covered in silver bat symbols and with a golden bat shaped necklace, the print looks great. His accessory is the old LEGO Bat attached to the flagpole element for a wizard staff.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">He includes a new soft material blue cape with the smaller cape element as well. A great looking variant that stands out quite well in this set.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This is an awesome group of Minifigures, the biggest draws in my opinion are Wizbat, Baturion and the Easter Bunny Batman. The only one I&rsquo;m not as thrilled with is Dollar Bill Batman, but that&rsquo;s just my taste, compared to the other three he&rsquo;s a bit blander and I feel a different suit might have fit in better with the overall thematic aesthetic of this item.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin: 0cm 0cm 8pt;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I&rsquo;d recommend tracking it down if you didn&rsquo;t get it originally, especially as this seems to be one of the last Bricktober exclusives to be produced. A really unfortunate thing that, but hey, at least we got a really great set out of this at the time.</span></span></span></span></p>
