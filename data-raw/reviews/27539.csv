The LEGO Ninjago Movie however limited their release to two BrickHeadz Exclusive to Toy&rsquo;s-R-Us, making them both highly collectible, highly sought after and highly difficult to find with Toy&rsquo;s-R-Us pretty much gone from most of the world.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The packaging is typical of LEGO BrickHeadz, instead of a shot of the actor on the side however or artwork depicting the character we have a LEGO Minifigure of Master Wu from the movie showing you what inspired this particular model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It&rsquo;s your standard BrickHeadz offering of parts, giving a lot of the side bricks with studs of course. A few printed elements for Master Wu&rsquo;s particular looking character and the tile that says this is an exclusive. Pretty decent parts pack.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Building a BrickHeadz model is fairly repetitive for the inner skeleton, with the same placement of bricks and other elements that do not differentiate it. The exterior details and facial designs are what really sell these models, making them look great and the builds are always fast, fun and great for challenges if you&rsquo;re interested in some of those things.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Master Wu looks really impressive as a completed model. Dig the looks of these things and you will enjoy them quite a lot. Unless you aren&rsquo;t a fan of these models. The best thing is the beard in my opinion, the overall design of it is just really impressive. I really like how they made the conical hat as well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;d recommend this set for fans of the character or the Theme. You probably won&rsquo;t be able to find it too easily anymore unfortunately, but Master Wu is a great figure to get, I kind of wish I hadn&rsquo;t missed out on Lloyd to go with him. Recommended.</p>
