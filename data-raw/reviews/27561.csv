Mainly the fact that there are no real levels which means they are set in the hub which is a new idea but it doesn&rsquo;t work as it make the hub quite liner and enclosed. However I respect the attempt to make the game unique but I would recommend dc super villains or marvel superheroes 2 over this</p>
