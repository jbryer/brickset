"_exile_","2018-01-25T00:32:08.56Z","Incredible!","<p>This might be my favourite build yet! It has so many features that would be the signature piece in any other set, and yet its a secondary or tertiary piece in this. Aside from the price, which was steep here in Canada, I can&#39;t say enough good things about this one! I mean there&#39;s a freaking rollercoaster on it!</p>

<p>The only knock I have and it could be sheer ignorance as I haven&#39;t seen the movie, but I don&#39;t understand Batman having rooms in the Joker Manor. It just seems out of place for Bruce to have a recording studio in it. However, it is pretty cool.</p>

<p>All in all, I do not regret spending a little more than I would for a Batman set. It&#39;s one of my all time favourite&nbsp;overall sets!</p>
