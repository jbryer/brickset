<p>OVERALL<strong> </strong>the <strong>New York Comic Con Exclusive BrickHeadZ&nbsp;BOBA FETT&nbsp;&amp; HAN SOLO in CARBONITE </strong>is probably the best Brickheadz model to date. More detailed than previous Brickheadz&nbsp;figures, has a nice build, premium packaging and an excellent desktop model. Let&#39;s break it down...</p>

<p>To&nbsp;pick one of these up you had to attend NYCC 2017 and enter&nbsp;a preshow lottery via New York Comic Con&#39;s website. Winners of the raffle can purchase the limited-edition set from the Lego Mobile BrickHeadZ Truck at Comic Con. From what I understand they had more in stock, so if you didn&#39;t get in the lottery and you went after 5pm (on certain days?) you would still have a chance to score one. Also at certain times you could get your box signed by&nbsp;Marcos Bessa, LEGO Set Designer (SHIELD Helicarrier, Disney Castle, The Simpson House, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>The BOX...</strong></p>

<p>Premium packaging here. Sturdy slipcase with excellent graphics all around (even on the numbered tape seal). I got number 1112 (which I believe is out of 5000).</p>

<p>Front...</p>

<p>Back (with New York Comic Con Exclusive graphic)...</p>

<p><strong>UNBOXING...</strong></p>

<p>After carefully cutting the seal, we separate the sturdy slipcase. We get 2 well printed instruction booklets and 2 bags. The bags are not numbered (even though in the instructions they&#39;ll refer to bags &#39;1&#39; and &#39;2&#39;) but you can see which bag belongs to its respective builds. The bags are resealable, which I wish Lego would do more to breakdown and repackage kits.</p>

<p><strong>INSTRUCTION BOOKLETS and PRINTED PARTS...</strong></p>

<p>The booklets are so well printed, excellent paper quality and have sharp,&nbsp;clear step by step instructions. Also, <strong>no stickers</strong> in this kit, with a plethora of printed/decorated elements.</p>

<p>No dreaded stickers here! You get Boba&#39;s&nbsp;infamous &#39;dent&#39;,&nbsp;hash marks for his Jedi kills, Mandalorian&nbsp;shoulder symbol, his macrobinocular viewplate, utility pouches, Han&#39;s Carbonite&nbsp;squinted eyes, 2 NYCC&nbsp;exclusive plates, 7 electronic panel pieces, and 1 control panel keypad.</p>

<p><strong>BOBA FETT...</strong></p>

<p>My favorite BrickHeadZ&nbsp;in the line! All over good build with nice details throughout. Detailed helmet w/dent, removable blaster rifle w/targeting scope, removable jetpack (w/turbo projected&nbsp;grappling hook), targeting rangefinder, viewplate, blast plates, back of helmet cooling vents, etc.</p>

<p>Blaster rifle, Jet-Pack (w/turbo projected&nbsp;grappling hook)&nbsp;and display stand (always love that Brickheadz&nbsp;face on the display)...</p>

<p><strong>HAN SOLO in CARBONITE...</strong></p>

<p>Really like how they got the shaping and the relief look for Han here. The Carbonite&nbsp;block has nice control panel details. You can display it standing up, on its back, &#39;floating&#39;&nbsp;(with handy clear risers), or standing on the wide display base (fits in a neat slot).</p>

<p><strong>FINAL THOUGHTS...</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m not a BrickHeadZ compleatist but this by far is the best of the line. The details, the packaging, the prints, all stellar!</p>

<p>Before NYCC&nbsp;these were selling for over $200usd presale. If you were lucky to attend, only $40 bucks-so quite reasonable. Now online I see, as of this review, about $100 to $150usd or so. If you&#39;re gonna&#39; pull the trigger and get a Brickheadz, this is the one! Check eBay and look for a deal.</p>

<p>There are other premium packaged Brickheadz from San Diego Comic Con but this has the details and look for a great desktop model. And for kids and the young at heart like myself ;), yes...these are fun to play with and custom your own.</p>

<p>In the long run, I feel Boba&nbsp;Fett will be released again in this Brickheadz form (maybe different colors or prints) but the Han in Carbonite&nbsp;might just only be in this exclusive kit.</p>

<p>I&#39;d like to see Lego push the envelope with highly&nbsp;detailed Brickheadz. Don&#39;t make them too simple a build. Really push the smaller pieces, details and prints.&nbsp;Even though this is the step child of Cube-Dudes, Funko Pops and even Kubros, there lots of potential here for creativity as evidenced by the fun&nbsp;Brickset custom Brickheadz contest that just ended. Great builders on this site.</p>

<p>Thanks to my man &#39;murphquake&#39; here on Brickset for getting me this kit. I was in attendance but just too busy at my Artist Alley table to get on line at the Lego Truck. As always much appreciate Bill!</p>
