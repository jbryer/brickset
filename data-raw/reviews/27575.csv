<p>THE BAG AND&hellip;ERR&hellip;THE BAG</p>

<p>Being only a single minifigure, Lester has no need for instructions, so we have only to look at the bag. Like many other polybags, this set doesn&rsquo;t have a name and being from the UK, much of the other typical set details are missing. This isn&rsquo;t a bad thing however. Just having the age range and set number paired with the simple background and yellow color scheme makes for a nice fresh look.</p>

<p>The bag is slightly smaller than the usual poly since, again, it just includes Lester. The plastic of the packaging is also slightly thinker than usual. The 21034 London set is silhouetted behind Lester. Very nicely done and eye catching.</p>

<p>THE MINIFIGURE</p>

<p>Lester is dressed in a smart blue suit with a British flag waistcoat and a red tie. His legs have no printing, but there&rsquo;s really no need for it anyway.</p>

<p>The back of Lester&rsquo;s suit jacket has two small buttons and a few other subtle details.</p>

<p>His face is exclusive and features a cheery smile well suited to welcoming customers to the Leicester Square Lego store. His eyebrows aren&#39;t visible until you remove his bowler hat, but they make him look even more friendly.</p>

<p>The bowler hat is unprinted which is nice since the black bowler hat is a tad rare.</p>

<p>Lester&rsquo;s accessory is a collapsed umbrella which is a great piece. He can hold it upright, flip it around and hold it like a cane or carry it in the center. It&rsquo;s too bad he can&rsquo;t hold it by the curved part.</p>

<p>The prints are nice and crisp, though the whites on Lester&rsquo;s waistcoat are rather muted. I would have liked a little more thickness to the white paint coat, but I can live with slightly muted.</p>

<p>OVERALL</p>

<p>A very nice collectable chap (does that make me sound British?) who can fit in nicely with any City or Modular Building scene. Lego did the right thing when they made this polybag, since scalpers were trying to make a ridiculous fortune off the grand opening Lester. IN YOUR FACE SCALPERS!!</p>

<p>Anyway, if you want a Lester, buy this one. The only difference between the two sets is the umbrella which the grand opening version doesn&#39;t even have! Let&rsquo;s see&hellip;you can spend upwards of $500 and get Lester or you can spend around $10 and get Lester plus his umbrella. Tough choice&hellip;not! I definitely recommend Lester, even if you have to pay $15 to get him. He&rsquo;s a special addition to anyone&rsquo;s collection. In fact, he&rsquo;s my second most prized minifigure in my entire collection! (Silver Centurion holds #1 and I don&rsquo;t foresee that changing anytime soon)</p>
