I mean this was one of the first brickheadz that they made, but still it looks so cubic instead of being rounded. There was only 1 printed piece in this set and most brickheadz have multiple prints. This was a pretty big let down. I would ot recommend buying this set unless you are a big Captain Phasma fan, or you find them at a really low price and you build of of them and then part out the others.</p>

(As it was released before they went bankrupt in the States.) Making this one of the harder sets to get a hold of on the Secondary Market. It also makes for a fairly interesting looking model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: This box has a kind of reddish colour to it with the word Exclusive above the number listing which BrickHeadz this is. A nice shot of Captain Phasma is on the side and that&rsquo;s about it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: As I&rsquo;ve noted in all of the BrickHeadz reviews these manuals work well for what you have, but are slightly trickier to keep open because bending them in half makes them want to remain bent in half. The design for BrickHeadz instructions could have used a better choice; however they are still what you expect from a LEGO set manual.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This BrickHeadz set includes a lot of grey elements in the medium and dark grey colours. As with most BrickHeadz sets you&rsquo;ll find at least several of the 1x2 tall brick elements with the side studs, since these are used primarily in the skeletal construction of every BrickHeadz. You&rsquo;ll also find a 1x4 printed tile for the utility belt part of her Stormtrooper armor.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Captain Phasma&rsquo;s model is really impressive as the build includes a lot of great techniques to make the blocky looking Stormtrooper helmet which Phasma wears. Her cape is also built very impressively to show the non-standard trooper detailing. As with all BrickHeadz I am continuously impressed with the techniques used to create these little collectibles.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Captain Phasma has a single hand visible holding a built blaster in that one hand, her other arm is hidden beneath the fold of cape built around her left side. The cape build continues around to the back; her helmet his built up quite cleverly and I am truly impressed with what we have here. All BrickHeadz have a lot of charm and personality and Phasma is no exception.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">BrickHeadz are fun, I&rsquo;ve said it before and I will say it again. These little things are fun to build, fun to collect, fun to display and fun to use for parts packs for those who are interested in collecting parts for MOC builds/creations. I strongly recommend getting your favorites and ignoring any that just don&rsquo;t interest you, as for this set itself I&rsquo;d very strongly recommend picking it up because Phasma has a very unique design and look to her compared to most other BrickHeadz. Overall Very Strongly Recommended.</p>
