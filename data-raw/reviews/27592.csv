So this is how he looked at the beginning of The Force Awakens.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The packaging says proudly that this is Exclusive #19. There is no Only at Toy&rsquo;s-R-Us logo on the packaging though, which is unusual as it was pretty much only available in Canada at Toy&rsquo;s-R-Us, though if LEGO sold it direct it&rsquo;s possible that could explain it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is of course the same as all the other BrickHeadz, folded in half and irritating to work with when building, unless you flatten it out with a few heavy LEGO books from your collection to un-crease it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with all BrickHeadz, Finn is loaded with a host of parts, making him and others ideal parts packs. Lots of tiles, the new larger Headlight style bricks in bley used for the skeletal structure of all BrickHeadz head designs, and of course some printed tiles showing detailed armor and belt designs from the First Order Stormtroopers.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Again, as with all BrickHeadz, the build is often enjoyable and fun with very satisfying steps to complete the look of the chosen character. In this case we have some good use of parts to make the little storage dealie on the back of most Stormtrooper belts, I believe canonically they store Thermal Detonators or Ammo Clips there. The legs for this model are built rather cleverly too in order to evoke an armored appearance. The blaster is nice, but somewhat on the smallish side, and I don&rsquo;t believe the look they chose quite matches up what the actual blaster design would be if built with bricks. (The barrel just looks a little too long.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Finn stands on a base with Exclusive printed beside the BrickHeadz symbol on a tile. The full model looks great, he really evokes someone wearing armour who has removed their helmet so you can see their face. The hair Finn has traditionally doesn&rsquo;t lend itself must to clever or unique build aspects unfortunately, basically there are a lot of visible studs on the head, folks who aren&rsquo;t a fan of this may not appreciate that this is, in essence, the closest way to achieve Finn&rsquo;s hairstyle in this scale.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Finn is another excellent looking BrickHeadz and I enjoy the model a great deal. I definitely recommend BrickHeadz to fans of the design aesthetics. If you don&rsquo;t appreciate any of these large headed brick-built figures these sets will either interest you for the parts or as a curiosity best ignored from LEGO. Still, I personally adore these sets and will continue to recommend them to as many folks as I can. Highly Recommended.</p>
