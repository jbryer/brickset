<p>Wow!&nbsp; Just... WOW!<br />
<br />
I feel like I got 2 sets in one here.&nbsp; LEGO could easily have made the Dragon and Airship separate from the music house.&nbsp; So good on them for the good value here (even better since I got it on sale).<br />
<br />
This build lasted me a bit longer than the others and was great fun to build.</p>

<p>The wind dragon is pretty awesome - articulated tail, neck, mouth, wings, and legs/feet.&nbsp; A great build.&nbsp; A two-seater also.</p>

<p>The music building was pretty neat too.&nbsp; Loving all the little details and, again, movement everywhere.&nbsp; A little floating island that moves back and forth, crystal outcropings that move, even roof tiles that shift up and down.&nbsp; I thought the way the harp was made was pretty clever.&nbsp; And the little songbird was a nice touch.<br />
<br />
Finally, Phyll the imp&#39;s little airship with working disc shooter is pretty cool too.&nbsp; The purpose of the hooks on the back is unclear, perhaps it can dock with some other imp set?<br />
<br />
If there is any shortfall, it is that Aria&#39;s bow is non-functional, unlike Azari&#39;s crossbow from the 2017 chariot set.&nbsp; But that&#39;s only a minor gripe on this otherwise fantastic set.<br />
<br />
All in all, an absolutely great set!</p>
