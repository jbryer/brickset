<br />
So apparently LEGO have &quot;seasons&quot; now, like a show.&nbsp; This apparently is a different season that my first two purchases and our antagonists now are not goblins, but some odd little winged imps.&nbsp; Fairly neat looking, though.&nbsp; Like seeing more new character molds.<br />
<br />
I continue to be impressed by how much movement are in LEGO now!&nbsp; &nbsp;Emily&#39;s eagle mount, which in days of yore would have been likely some solid mold, maybe with attachable wings, has fully articulated head, feet, and tail in addition to moving wings.&nbsp; Very nice!</p>

<p>The villain of the piece, guarding a treasure (including a super-hidden tablet [which looks like it may go with Emily&#39;s book?]) is our little imp thing.&nbsp; He has a little flying craft that detaches from his treasure cave and can fire some largeish discs.&nbsp; Look out Emily!</p>

<p>Once again all the little details and the amount of moving parts continue to impress.&nbsp; Emily&#39;s necklace is even a separate piece, which I&#39;m sure would have just been printed on her clothes back in the day.</p>

<p>Overall a quick build but rather fun.</p>

The Emily Jones figure is very cool and casual, with the wonderful amulet piece included in such a small set! The bar figure is very cute and wacky and I love the dual moulding! As usual, elves does not disappoint with the building experience! I found myself constantly engaged and interested in this build compared to many other sets!</p>

<p>Lumia the Eagle is included and her build is very elegant and magnificent. The white and gold colour scheme is one that I have a soft spot for. Even though the eagle is small, the designers managed to capture the look of a fantasy eagle perfectly, with the good wings originally used for Pegasus. The head is also well constructed and has printed eyes and seating for one minidoll! The eagle balances well too!&nbsp;Oh yeah by the way, NO stickers used in this set!!</p>

<p>The sets in this elves wave focus on one buildable&nbsp;animal, a scenery build for elvendale or the shadow realm and an antagonist character. The batcave build is nice and the colours are very evil looking! The chest has some gems and cherries, with the missing diary page for Emily Jones hidden underneath (nice alternative to just chucking it in the chest) There&#39;s also a spider with pie and a bat bed which works well. The bat glider is very cool as well and the disc shooter adds fun(although it somehow cannot shoot down the eagle)</p>

<p>This set doesn&#39;t seem to include much for its price but has superb playability and a very nice build! Thanks for reading my review!</p>
