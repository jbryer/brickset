<p>A nice little set, original and&nbsp;well done by the original designer - Maia Weinstock. These are three nice little builds, with some interesting building techniques used. For anyone interested in science and space exploration this is a nice set to have.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>All the parts come in three unnumbered bags, and with the pieces for every display divided among them. You have to open all the bags at once. You can split up the build in nice little parts - the three displays - and even subdivide those&nbsp;into building the stand and building the display. I took my time building, but I would guess someone can build this set in about 20 minutes or even less. Some of the newer parts (apparently first produced in 2017) have been used in this set with positive effect.&nbsp;Also, no stickers, everything is printed.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>The minifigures are excellent, and correspond nicely to the pictures (as printed in the manual) of the real individuals they are supposed to depict, in dress, face print and hair style. It is nice to see Sally Ride and Mae Jemison each wearing different space suits (one blue, one orange) as well. All minifigs&nbsp;have an alternate face print. I am not sure to what extent the various parts and prints are unique for Lego minifigs.</p>

<h2>The build(s)</h2>

<p>The three minibuilds&nbsp;share similar display footings, though each of them is constructed differently. And IMHO each has something the recommend them: The Margeret Hamilton display was the most elegant in its construction design (especially building the white wall), the space shuttle is simply an eye-catcher, and the most creative use of parts - the Lego trash can -&nbsp;was in the construction&nbsp;of the Hubble telescope.</p>

<p>The one little thing that I have an issue with, is that Mae Jemison is carrying a helmet, which continues to fall out of her hands.</p>

<h2>Playability vs Displayability</h2>

<p>This set is clearly designed as a display set. One can play around&nbsp;a little with the space shuttle, but that is about it.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>A small, nice&nbsp;set, something completely different from what we normally see from Lego. The use of parts is very effective, and even though small in size, the displays do catch one&#39;s eye. What&#39;s more, the prise is quite reasonable, I think. Highly recommended.</p>

I can&rsquo;t recall an Ideas set in recent memory that wasn&rsquo;t well received by the fans or the buying public. This set is based on real-world people involved with the Space Program and much like Research Institute includes predominantly female characters of real-world historical import. That pretty much covers everything, let&rsquo;s move on to the review.</span></span></span></span></p>

Her face is dual-sided as well with a large smile on one side and a less toothy smile on the other. I could discuss their real world counterparts more, but I am frankly clueless on the real-world equivalents of these Minifigures so I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;ll have to discuss the details and parts only.</span></span></span></span></p>

Her outfit is printed on a dual-sided torso and she&rsquo;s using a very nice looking hair sculpt in grey&hellip; I think it&rsquo;s the same hair used by the Hollywood Starlet actually, though as I write this I don&rsquo;t have them side-by-side so I can&rsquo;t be 100% sure on that. Like with Margaret she does not include any accessories, and as with all of the figures so far she has two expressions, one smile with open mouth showing teeth and the other a bit more neutral of an expression.</span></span></span></span></p>

She gets an accessory, a camera, unlike the rest of the figures, and her head is dual-sided, one with smiling and the other is a bit of an angry scowl actually&hellip; does this mean she is upset with somebody? Or is it a re-use of a head from a different character? I can&rsquo;t say for certain, but seeing as how the others seemed to feature unique prints I can&rsquo;t imagine LEGO would re-use another head with another print from someone else for this character.</span></span></span></span></p>

Two of the three vignettes are really quite impressive actually, all of the models are very nicely done, the third vignette is a re-creation of a photo which the instructions showcases and honestly it&rsquo;s the weakest of the three because it just looks a little bland, it also suffers a bit from not being very scientific oriented. (I mean stacking a bunch of files or something just doesn&rsquo;t impress as much as a space shuttle or a satellite.)</span></span></span></span></p>

It looks great and is a nice tribute to the real-world people behind some of the most important technological discoveries and achievements of the Space program in the past century. If you&rsquo;re a fan of Space and Real-World history you&rsquo;re definitely going to enjoy this set. I strongly recommend this one, and the price can&rsquo;t be beat compared to some of the other Ideas sets they&rsquo;ve made.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Galaxy12_Import","2022-09-28T02:15:01.233Z","Desktop Reminder of the Great Minds Around Us","<p>To me, this is the kind of set the Ideas theme lends itself to the best. A small desktop display that would not be hard to&nbsp;MOC on your own is made all the better thanks to the official LEGO treatment, the highlight being the superb minifigures and printed nameplates. I found this second-hand about the same time that the 50th&nbsp;Anniversary Lunar Lander came out, and the models complement each other perfectly (still gotta get that Saturn V).&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the intersection of microscale and space exploration, along with exclusive historical minifigures, I can&#39;t find many reasons not to pick up this set if you have the opportunity.</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2020-08-16T20:22:12.117Z","Great set but not the best choice for an ideas set ","<p>&nbsp;Opening;</p>

<p>Women of NASA is a set with very nice parts builds and figures it just not the best choice for an ideas set .</p>

<p>The Minifigures-</p>

<p>The minifigures include Margaret Hamilton , Sally Ride , Nancy G Roman and Mae Jemison all of which have dual sided heads and at least one exclusive print . The Accessories include are a helmet and a camera .</p>

<p>The builds-</p>

<p>&nbsp;The first build is Margaret Hamiltons area which uses a very nice technique to allow the wall behind to stand there is also a coat rack and a pile of books she is stacking from the famous picture and lastly her name is printed onto a 1&times;4 white tile . The second build is Nancy G Romans area which consists of a very well done satellite using a bin piece and printed solar panels , there is also a printed panel of a black hole think but I am not sure she too has her name printed on a 1&times;4 white tile . And finally we have Mae Jemison and Sally Rides shared podium it is rather plain and has both of there names printed on 1&times;4 white tiles . The main part of this section is the really good shuttle build , it has all of the details down apart from some colours used to connect to the fuel tank and two additional boosters this build in fact was slightly changed and also used in the 2020 ISS .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a good set but making it a female specific NASA set was unnecessary why can&#39;t we have set celebrating men and womens off world accomplishments not that women shouldn&#39;t be celebrated I just feel as if they either released and men of NASA at the same time or if the released them together because only celebrating men and women separately won&#39;t get us anywhere in the current social political climate .</p>
