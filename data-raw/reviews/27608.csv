"Sobel","2018-03-11T18:47:00.707Z","Here comes the holiday feelings!","<p>Since I&#39;m an old friend of camping and caravaning myself, as soon as I saw this set in the latest LEGO catalogue, I knew it had to be added to my collection! But since our wedding anniversary was coming up, my wife had ruled out a complete no-buy-order for LEGO for me! Well, I surely expected some LEGO as a gift and so it was! I got this beautiful and detailed set along with bottle of finest Bushmills Whiskey! Oh glorious day!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Just the usual for cars/trucks and trailers. the wheels have different sizes, which I personally found very nice and a realistic detail. You get a lot of windows for the trailer and some nice interior parts like cups, chairs and an &quot;oven&quot;.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The set comes with three minfigures, which is OK for a set this size and price range. We have father, mother and a kid. Additionally, you get a fish, a crab and some gear (net, camera, a toy sailboat and a gas cooker)</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Both vehicles are built from bottom to top, with the alcove of the trailer being added wih TECHNIC pins. Nothing unexpected, but what would you imagine with a set this size?</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>What a sweet set!! The truck is quite big and looks very powerful with its big tires and front. The trailer, despite being not so large as I expected, is full of details, like the mentioned oven and stove, a coffee machine, table and chairs and steps which lead to the alcove, where there&#39;s room for two to sleep.<br />
The right side of the trailer opens up completely, so a good access for playing is guaranteed! The trailer sits loose on the truck, but this gives it good movement, so even sharp turns are no problem. The trailer also has a small &quot;foot&quot; so it can stand individually.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>What a great addition to every truck/vehicle collection! It&#39;s highest value is its playability, though only being a medium-sized set. The three minifigures and the abundance of gear give a you a big variety of possibilities. Would make a very nice gift to boys or girls the same and can be nicely included in every city/country/adventure-themed playstyle! An absolute recommendation, especially at a special discount around 20&euro;!!</p>

<p>In some ways this set is&nbsp;perhaps one of the more unusual vehicles in the Lego City &#39;Great Vehicles&#39; or &#39;Traffic&#39; theme, but IMHO this might be one of the better sets. It is a bit of a break from the more common truck and trailer. Overall, it is surprisingly big. It has many fun accessories, a nice reference to other sets, and overall offers many opportunities for play. It can even serve as a starting point for a &#39;camping out&#39; themed display. Personally I like it more than - for instance - the 2016 creator 3-in-1 camper (set &#39;Vacation getaways, 31052).&nbsp;The price is very reasonable at RRP, IMHO. I would recommend this set.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>This set is by and large a very easy build, the 5-12 age range seems appropriate to me. Total build time is easily under 1 hour. There are not too many stickers, most of them easy to apply (sole exception the one on the curved caravan canopy. That said, especially the two stickers on the side wall in the front need to be applied with care, as the striping on these stickers needs to line up with the striping on the rest of the caravan.</p>

<p>Construction of the vehicle is straightforward, no really special construction techniques used; the most tricky part for younger builders is probably the use of a little technic to fix the front of the caravan in place. The one thing I did not like is that the wheel wells are a bit see through; I would probably look to modify (and close them up) this at some point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this was still quite a fun build.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are three minifigures in this set - a mom, dad and their son. I like their clothing as well as the face prints. None of the minifigures&nbsp;has an alternative face print, or print on the legs. All torso&#39;s have a print on the front and back depicting casual outdoor clothing. There is a nice fishing net and two piece sail boat for the son, a foto camera for the mother, and a gas&nbsp;cooking set - with crab and fish to cook - for the father.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The whole set looks nice, with no obvious things lacking. I like the colour scheme of both the caravan and the pick-up. The Technic support for the caravan is mostly hidden from sight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pick-up truck is solid, and has nice paneling. There are no doors, and the interior has little detail. The sticker on the roof is a nice one. The hitch for the caravan is simple but effective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The caravan is fairly large, though does not look oversized for the towing vehicle. I like the colour scheme. There is a nice interior, with a bed, oven, and some seating. Access is provided by one of the side-walls, that can be opened, and the front roof top can be removed so one can tuck one of the minifigures into bed. The stand for the caravan is simple but effective.The seating can easily be taken outside (since it is fixed on a single stud).</p>

<p>My favourite&nbsp;part of the set&nbsp;is the sailing boat for the son: very simple, only two pieces, but very effective.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>Overall I think this is an excellent play set. A child can easily move the vehicles around, the attachment of the caravan to the truck is fairly solid, so some fairly rough driving is possible. The moveable side-wall makes it easy to put in the minifigures. The accessories also offer numerous scenarios for play.</p>

<p>This set could be a nice start for a display; unfortunately there are some gaps in the truck and caravan that beg for a (smalll?) mod to get them fixed.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>Overall IMHO this is an excellent set - fairly big, something different from most, and a nice number accessories for many scenarios to be played out. The price IMHO is also very good, especially if the set is found on a discount. Sure, there is room for improvement, but overall this is a set well worth getting.</p>

"BuildTheBrick","2018-04-27T20:21:06.17Z","I. Love. This. Set.","<p>Read the title, I. Love. This. Set. It really&nbsp;gives custom builders a reason to keep both major parts, however, the trailer pull is asking for something to pull, as long as the caravan is on there it will be unused, the caravan is pulled by the hitch in the flatbed. The truck is basic, one seater like we should be used to by now. The caravan has a TV, a microwave that looks like an oven, a TV, two chairs, and bed space that is not really minifig&nbsp;accessible&nbsp;without getting&nbsp;help from your hands.</p>

<p><strong>All in all</strong>&nbsp;AWESOME set, LEGO designed this beautifully!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Throughout the years, Lego has attempted to incorporate Campers into their line-up of vehicles for City. Though they have designed intricate versions on Campers in the past, this model really intrigued myself. No other model in the past has put so many details into one model as this one has. It is unique since the addition of the Truck, enables more techniques in connecting the two components of the set. Nowadays, more families can be seen utilizing this type of Caravan for their travels. It fits in quite well with the Lego city, unlike previous models.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What I enjoyed about this set:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Real-life accuracy was exceptional in this model. The truck did not look out-of place with the Caravan and did not need any modifications to compliment the Caravan. The Caravan itself was quite interesting to build and extremely satisfactory to complete. The level of detail achieved with the set did not seem to deter the build experience. Moreover, the details helped with the continuity with the build. I specifically enjoyed constructing the little sleeping area in the Caravan. Overall, the model felt natural to set in my city and obscure among the vehicles.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The minifigures really made the set feel complete. In the 2016 People Pack - Fun in the Park, the two adults of the set are depicted to have a little baby in a stroller. Now two years later, they are seen with an older child, as though they have matured in their relationship and made the decision to go camping for the first time. It is a unique Easter egg that Lego placed in the set, even though the daughter/ older women with the baby, besides the mother, is not portrayed in the set. It may be up to imagination for what could have transpired.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What I disliked about this set:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The only concern I have about the set was how crammed it felt to build. Even with the intense amount of detail packed into the set, I felt as though the Lego designers could have increased the scale of the models just a tad more. It is very cumbersome to pack all of the minifigures&nbsp;camping supplies in the model and still have room for them to relax in. The one area that should have had more space was the sleeping quarters in the Caravan, since one figure cannot feel cozy in that small of space up top. The truck could have also used another seat to alleviate the stress for the figures to pack all the supplies in the Caravan. I understand that Lego has guidelines on what needs to be produced every year for City vehicles, but they could have put at least 75 more pieces in to make the model feel more sturdy and viable to live in.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><b>Would I recommend this set?</b></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Given the concerns on how crammed it felt while building, I was still amazed at the enjoyment I felt while constructing the model. The addition of the minifigures&nbsp;made the model feel more complex than what it was portrayed as. The continuity with the characters allowed for Lego to expand its ever popular City collection, even with their iconic figures. The truck was very sturdy and was not as awkward as set in the City. The Caravan also made the model flow while building and placing it among the houses in the city. A lot of detail within the model made me feel more compelled in how detailed Lego goes to make their models. This reignited my passion for constructing my set once again.&nbsp;</li>
