<p>The bright color tone of this set is as striking as it can be, the building experience is simple and easy, although there&#39;s not much playable function around, I personally do think that this set is worth the bucks and it do really well to sits on your display shelf which looks eye catching and&nbsp;stunningly beautiful.</p>
