<p>The minifigures are all new (<em>to us</em>) and look terrific. The snowboard has two stickers that make it look different from any snowboard we have gotten in the past. The snowboarder has one expression and it can be classified as grim/determined. I would have liked to have seen this one have a dual face print but it&#39;s alright as-is. The two rescue minifigures look good as well with the female rescue figure having a&nbsp;cool cap/ponytail one-piece part for her head. I like that we are seeing more and more sets with a variety of male and female figures. My son seems to appreciate that too. LEGO has stepped this up the past few years and it&#39;s a welcome direction to see.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The helicopter build moves along very smoothly. The landing skids are attached in a nifty fashion and are totally posable to any terrain it may land on. The instructions tripped up my son with regards to the engine base (<em>dark grey&nbsp;1x2 and base with rotor&nbsp;peg</em>) and the two side steps. He miscounted his&nbsp;studs and placed the engine and the two 1x2 studs in the wrong spots. Once we looked a bit closer at the instructions we saw where the arrows pointed to snap the side steps onto the side rails. Otherwise, the build was smooth. The stickers are at a minimum and what is present is useful and relevant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rear door and stretcher slide works very well and the stretcher stays in place while the helo&nbsp;is being flown. One point to bring up is that unlike the helicopter in 60138 High-speed Chase, this one sits on all three landing&nbsp;skids. That is a welcome change as&nbsp;my son was (<em>and still is</em>) disappointed that the helo in 60138 sits on its tail boom.</p>

<p>Overall this is a fabulous set. From the choice of minifigures to the subject matter and playability it&#39;s a winner. For $19.99 it&#39;s a terrific value for the price point.&nbsp;</p>
