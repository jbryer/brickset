"Jett_Pyre","2018-12-20T12:15:53.797Z","My first 2018 Star Wars set","<p>This is a very cheap way to get a new Darth Vader Minifigure&nbsp;even though it&#39;s the same that comes in 75183 Darth Vader Transformation. It&#39;s pretty much like every other pod set that has come out, but the difference being that it&#39;s Star Wars and not Ninjago or Friends. I got this set free from the Lego Company just for asking about it and telling how it came to be and they were generous enough to actually send it and when I asked &quot;why was I sent this&quot;? They then said &quot;Oh, because we can tell you&#39;re a big fan&quot;. And that I am. So I do think this set is worth a buy if you can find it cheap or if Lego is giving it away as a promation then go for it there</p>
