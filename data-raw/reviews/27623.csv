<p>I, like many Lego Star Wars fans, was surprised to see&nbsp;this set pop up seemingly out of nowhere. It appeared to be essentially a pallette swap with the countless iterations of the tried and true Snowspeeder design in existence since the beginning of the Lego Star Wars line. Though I&#39;ve collected Lego Star Wars since 7150 Tie Fighter &amp; Y Wing, I&#39;ve somehow managed to avoid every one of those Snowspeeder releases.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>But this release grabbed my attention due to its outstanding Rebel pilots (Lego has been great to Rebel/Resistance pilot collectors recently) and the mystery of its source material (I&#39;ve heard it&#39;s from the Battle of Jakku&nbsp;as portrayed in Battlefront II, but playing the game myself I have yet to see the ship). Seeing it on the shelf at Target, I knew I had to pick it up and finally add a T-47 to my collection. I thought I&#39;d try my hand at my first review here since I haven&#39;t seen any written reviews online yet. I&#39;ll start with the build and then move on to the minifigs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build(s)</strong></p>

<p>The Sandspeeder came together quickly with simple yet clever building techniques. The cockpit comprises&nbsp;Bag 1, with a couple of the newer grey and red control screen/console pieces at each seat. Lego executes the opposite-facing cockpit design of the T-47 very well, with enough space to allow both figures to sit comfortably&nbsp;while keeping the ship compact. The venerable cockpit canopy piece appears to have slightly different coloring then past releases, with a tan color to match the ship&#39;s livery. The nose detail is supplied with a sticker, typical for Lego these days. The rear gun is a simple studshooter&nbsp;that works well enough but can easily be swapped out or modified with a more detailed design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wings come together very quickly, with some nice detail around the middle section that extends into the cannons. Lego has chosen to use the tried and true cannon piece from yesteryear even after moving away from it on many newer Star Wars sets in favor of more detailed brick built gun emplacements. The winglet pieces, the most notable structural addition onto past T-47&nbsp;designs,&nbsp;each get a sticker that it is easy to apply and adds a nice touch of detail.</p>

<p>This element echos an unreleased Sandspeeder&nbsp;design from the original Kenner action figure line and many outlets have made the connection that this set is an homage to that design. I would tend to agree as the similarity in the winglets&nbsp;and the use of the same name as the prototype&nbsp;is impossible to ignore. This connection really draws me to this set, and places it into the history of Star Wars toys as a way for kids to imagine their own Star Wars universe beyond what is seen in the films.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The moisture vaporator&nbsp;is simple yet effective at capturing the on-screen&nbsp;look of the machinery. It&nbsp;adds a nice background for display for AFOLs and has hinged play feature for the kids. All together this was about a 30-40 minute build at a leisurely pace.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>These figures are simply excellent. The grey jumpsuit is identical or nearly identical in printing to the blue squadron pilots from the Rogue One sets. I think I like the print here better than on the blue squadron pilots, as it contrasts nicely with the grey while it is somewhat drowned out on the dark blue. The only other grey pilot I know of was the grey squadron pilot from the last B-Wing release, and his printing reflects the A-Wing/B-Wing/ROTJ&nbsp;pilot design as opposed to the X-Wing/Y-Wing/ANH pilot design used here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Sandspeeder&nbsp;pilot has a female&nbsp;face&nbsp;with yellow visor and chinstrap, and includes two expressions (smirk and distressed). I believe this is the first time Lego has released a female pilot face with the visor and chinstrap, and this piece will be in serious demand for MOC-ers&nbsp;who want to add some variety to their pilot corps. Her helmet is identical to that used by Red 4 in ANH (h/t the internet) and therefore represents another sought after piece for anyone trying to recreate Red Squadron or devise a backstory for Red 4 before his untimely demise in the film.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gunner has the same two-sided yellow&nbsp;visor pilot face that appeared in the Rogue One sets and other recent Rebel sets. However, his helmet is another piece that is sure to be sought after. The helmet design is identical to the helmet worn by Rey in TFA at her AT-AT home on Jakku. This opens up numerous MOC possibilities showing Rey&#39;s life on her homeworld.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I have never built a Lego Snowspeeder so I cannot compare the build to past releases, but I would not be surprised if the build was virtually identical to the T-47 in the Echo Base playset. Presumably this means Lego did not have to invest much in design on this set and Lego has received criticism for releasing a simple re-skin at full retail price ($30 USD for 278 pieces appears average for the Star Wars line). However, the context of the set as an homage to an unreleased action figure vehicle&nbsp;re-skin, the inclusion of the female pilot face, and the inclusion of sought after, film seen helmet designs makes this set highly desirable for collectors. For kids, this set adds imagination and variety to their own Star Wars stories.</p>

<p>I would&#39;ve liked to see an Imperial minifig&nbsp;like a Sandtrooper or even a generic Stormie&nbsp;added at this price, or instead a lower retail price of $25 USD. Either of these would&#39;ve make this set a must buy for all Star Wars Lego collectors. Still, if you&#39;re like me and appreciate the subtle homages and nods to Star Wars on screen and the history of Star Wars&nbsp;collectibles&nbsp;(and if Rebel pilots draw you in like catnip), you&#39;ll be happy to add this to your collection at full price.&nbsp;</p>

"abordoli","2018-01-11T05:12:44.58Z","Just Different Colors? Not Entirely.","<p>Your first instinct when you buy this set is: Is this just a T-47 Snowspeeder that was seen in The Empire Strikes Back with sand colors rather than white. Not entirely. When I built this, I had the latest iteration of a Snowspeeder (from the Assault on Hoth set) on hand so that I could make comparisons down to every last detail. Remember: This was probably the Landspeeder (different model possibly) that the rebels at the base Hoth were&nbsp;adapting to the colder temperatures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The way the wings are attached is different using technic structural components. Some of the slanted pieces on the wings are different and this version has A-Wing type fins. No tow-cable, but a tiny storage&nbsp;spot in the rear. The braking flaps are angled and their is no sticker underneath revealing details. The&nbsp;red firing missiles&nbsp;have been moved further to the bow of the&nbsp;under-craft.&nbsp;</p>

"Lego_fan_","2019-06-02T23:18:12.847Z","a nice addition. ","<p>This little gem is a really neat Lego Star Wars set. It includes 1 Sandpeeeder, 1 pilot Minifigure, 1 rear gunner Minifigure, 1 light bluish gray snake, extra stud and spring loaded shooter amo,&nbsp;&nbsp;and one moisture vaporator. Although I a not sure if this set is in one of the Star Wars ty shows i know that it is just like a snow speeder but made for the sand. the Sandspeeder itself looks just like the 2014 rebel snow speeder with some structural changes. you can fit the two Minifigs inside the cockpit back to back just like the previous models. It also includes two wing mounted spring loaded shooters(one on each wing) and a rear stud shooting gun. The moisture vaporator&nbsp;is built on top a rock element and looks very true to the films. you can even shoot it and one end will flip up since it is on a hinge. overall i think this set is great, and is a must have set for any Lego or Star Wars collector.&nbsp;</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-11-30T23:41:54.073Z","A very unique idea for a good set","<p>This is a pretty good set and is a neat concept and idea for a set. I think there is something called a &quot;Sandspeeder&quot; in Star Wars legends but I&#39;m not sure. It is basically a Snowspeeder but in dark and light tan with some gray accents. There is also a moisture evaporator on a rock with a snake underneath. The snake is in a bluish gray color that I have not seen before and was a fine addition to the set. It was also nice to get exclusive mini figures in this set and some exclusive helmet printing for the pilots since most rebel pilots customize their helmets. This allows you to add more pilots to a briefing room without all of them looking the same. The side build for this is pretty cool and can be used a equipment for a base of some sort and I appreciate the addition of it. The parts included are very useful and have many uses. There are few stickers in this set which is nice. Overall, I would recommend buying this set.</p>
