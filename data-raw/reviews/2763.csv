As such, it sets some standards for the coming years such as the driver's place and the two-size wheels, and it introduces some killer-popular pieces (the arms and bucket, the road sign, the minifig's spade and pick). But it also certainly have room for improvement: the cabin doesn't yet have a proper seat, and the road block fence is so basic that it should rather have been avoided.

It is nice for such a tiny set to feature two minifigures. One of them has a fairly rare black-and-blue shirt. The other has a common blue shirt with pockets, but it also feature a very rare men-at-work vest that can be found only in '79 construction sets.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This set is perfect for the town under construction or working on a new street, this is perfect to have.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
