	<li>
	<p>Set 3850070-1 is the LEGO <i><b>Oille</b></i> roller-coaster that is a <b><i>Pick a Model</i></b> at LEGOLAND Florida that&nbsp;is recommended for ages 6+ And has 58 pieces.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>This&nbsp;set&nbsp;is very smooth and clean. It includes all the details&nbsp;of Oille and he even has a nice smile. There are 2 sets of small wheels on the bottom so it won&#39;t fit on the LEGO roller-coaster track which is kind of sad for me. The roller-coaster&nbsp; is supposed to be minfig scale but I feel like it&#39;s a little bigger then minfig scale. This set came out in 2017 and it cost 7.99 on the LEGOLAND Florida shop website.</p>
