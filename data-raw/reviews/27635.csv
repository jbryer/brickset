<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Harley Quinn&#39;s hair is my favorite part of the figure. The combination of red and black are really nice, along with the curls in the pig tails. Her face is doubled sided. The one you see in the image and then there is other face which is a face of her winking her right eye. Then the white skirt was a nice addition to the set as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just building a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>My overall opinion is that this is a great figure for kids. The new hair piece with the pig tails was really nice. The white skirt and the gold and silver roller blades are some nice pieces to get as well. The doubled sided face was nice as well.The detail on her is&nbsp;really good as well. Overall it is a great figure for kids which is why I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

Her legs feature no printing, she has no hand-held accessories, but she does come with a pair of mismatched roller skates, one pearl gold the other silver and features a white tutu piece.</p>

<p>She includes two expressions, one winking with a smile and the other with her tongue sticking out. Her mask looks odd on that face, almost as if the thing was supposed to be printed with the winking expression instead. It might be an error in printing honestly. Overall though she&#39;s a solid looking figure from The LEGO Batman Movie and her costume is very stylish. Highly Recommended.</p>
