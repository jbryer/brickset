This variant is very well put together with a lot of excellent details. He also comes with a cloth coattail piece and matching white tie, although considering his suit has a gold tie printed on the torso, the white bow tie really adds a bit of irreverent humour to the look.</p>

<p>Overall this is another solid variant and a great figure from Series 2 of The LEGO Batman Movie Collectible Minifigures Wave. If you don&#39;t already own one I&#39;d recommend tracking one down. Recommended.</p>
