<p>Clock king is one of the most goofy and ridiculous Batman villains and his minifigure rendition is of the best from the Batman movie series two .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure reuses the gingerbread man head just with a new print flipped around and in blue there is a very nice green cape , his torso features the alarm clock pattern and this continues on to the legs , arms and side legs .</p>

<p>The Accessories-</p>

<p>are fairly bland but get the intention of the hands of a clock across the stand is the regular Batman movie series two printed Batman emblem .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a great figure with very detailed prints the only downside is the bland Accessorys however I still recommend picking it up .</p>

For The LEGO Batman Movie, the character&#39;s outlandish costume choice was decided upon for the fun humour typical of LEGO.</p>

<p>Clock King from that series is not Clock King here, this represents the original Comic version of Clock King. He dresses in a ridiculous looking blue suit with images of time pieces printed all over it, he includes a green cloth cape and his head is re-using the Gingerbread Man head, the reverse side has been printed with a clock face, while the sculpted portion with eyes has rivets and visible gears seen inside the sculpted area for the eyes on the Gingerbread Man. A very clever re-use of parts.</p>

<p>Carrying two spears meant to represent Minute Hands (The Second Hand is smaller and therefore he isn&#39;t using any, ) our friend Clock King is a highly impressive looking representation of a very E-List Rogues Gallery Villain. Overall I feel this character looks great, is very fitting for The LEGO Batman Movie and works very well with the part choices. He comes Highly Recommended.</p>
