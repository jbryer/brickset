Dressed in a full body smock, using dual-moulded legs for his black boots and carrying two chemical beakers for no doubt nefarious purposes, Professor Strange includes a beard element and some nice printing on his face. The menacing scowl and silver mirror glasses are very nicely done.</p>

<p>With minimal detail printing Professor Strange&#39;s torso and legs are perfect for generic scientists in MOC lab scenes. So I feel that, despite what some may say, this character is great for some MOC potential. Overall he&#39;s a solid offering and stands in quite nice as a staff member for Arkham Asylum. Strongly Recommended.</p>
