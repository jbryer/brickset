This version of Batman is useful for thwarting aquatic criminals in and around Gotham City. It&#39;s also good to show up that pathetic hero Aquaman. Yes, LEGO Batman doesn&#39;t need Aquaman&#39;s help, with sophisticated Wayne Technologies Diving Gear he can use a tail-like fin and trident to command the creatures of the seven seas.</p>

<p>Or, you know, maybe not. With some impressive scale printing on the black Mermaid tail (Only found in this release) and a great bat abs print complete with manly seashell nipple protectors (all the fashion in Atlantis these days.) our stalwart defender of Gotham City is prepared to unleash waves of trouble for criminals everywhere.</p>

<p>Overall this is a fairly clever variant of Batman and highly collectible for the parts alone. Highly Recommended.</p>
