<p>Comes in normal CMS bag with normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Besides the normal minifigure&nbsp;parts you get a dolphin and a red floatation device.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Batman is okay. Normal detail on him nothing to special. The abs and swimsuit on him is the only printing on him. His mask is the same except for the goggles where the eye holes would be. His head is only single sided.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Just building a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great figure to get for the pieces. The dolphin and red flotation device are great to get. The printing is okay. The mask is pretty good. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Swimming pool Batman is an ok variant with one non exclusive cool accessory .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure has the same dual moulded cowl as series one vacation Batman , the head is a happy Batman face , the torso shows his nine pack......but wait.......where&#39;s his extra ab and his legs are just flesh legs with some sort of swimming atire printed on it .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>His Accessories are not exclusive, either of them , but he has one cool one the life preserver is not exclusive and has come in other CMFs before but his dolphin is very nice , only coming in on people pack fun at the beach prior . His stand is just the Lego Batman movie series two printed Batman emblem piece .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is an ok figure as he has some cool parts but only 3/7 parts are exclusive though I would still recommend it .</p>

Wearing his swim trunks and carrying a floaty, he will help save and preserve the freedom of all Gotham Citizens who just want to have a good time swimming.</p>

<p>With goggles sculpted onto the cowl to add to the fun look of this variant and a very detailed movie-accurate set of abs, Swimming Pool Batman is one of the better variants offered in The LEGO Batman Movie series of Minifigures. As an added bonus each Swimming Pool Batman comes with his own Dolphin ally. The LEGO Dolphin is a brand-new piece that can attach two key areas to bricks, via the tail and the torso just under the fins.</p>

<p>Overall this is an excellent offering and I Highly Recommend it.</p>
