<p>The beach variants within The Lego Batman Movie series 2 was kind of a little sub-series within the main one, and the majority of them, while fun and not necessarily awful figures, felt like filler spots and were some of the weaker figures of the series. Tropical Joker is the exception, and he&rsquo;s easily the best of the 5 beach variant figures and one of the best of the series.</p>

<p>Starting from the legs, he&rsquo;s got dual-molded legs with dark purple for the top half for swimming trunks and white in the bottom half and there&rsquo;s some green sandals printed on the feet as well. Attached at the hip is the inflatable floaty duck piece first introduced with&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71017-5/Vacation-Batman"">Vacation Batman</a>, now recolored to match the appropriate colors of Joker, with the main color of green, red for the bill, and a purple patch printed to the side of the piece. This piece is so awesome and I really like the exclusive coloring and printing. His torso print is my favorite part of the figure, where it&rsquo;s a medium azure shirt with red palm trees printed on the front and back, and it&rsquo;s a really great looking print. There&rsquo;s even detailing on the arms with dual-molded arms for the sleeves of his shirt and playing card symbols on it which is just great. His face prints has pink shades and his very cartoony sharp teeth cracking a smile which just looks adorable honestly, and his alternate face has a more menacing and sinister smile, which doesn&rsquo;t look like too much of a difference from the primary expression, but hey, I&rsquo;ll take it. His hair is the green bushy swept back piece introduced for The Joker in the Lego Batman Movie line. Finally, his accessories are a camera and a trans-neon green ice pop, which are admittedly pretty mundane accessories, though I can excuse the camera since it&rsquo;s a reference to &ldquo;The Killing Joke&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Overall, I&rsquo;m really happy that at least one of the beach variant characters within the series managed to stand out as one of the best figures of the series. I just love his vibrant colors and his torso print, and his face prints and... just about everything!...other than the accessories which I could excuse. It&rsquo;s a very well executed figure and I think a lot of Batman fans can get a kick out of this fun minifigure. I highly recommend it.</p>

Tropical Joker is dressed for a great time on vacation in some tropical hideaway. He comes with a popsical made out of smilax chemicals no doubt, a camera and the duck floaty from Series 1 in Joker Green with matching hair curl printed on the duck&#39;s head.</p>

<p>The torso is suitably detailed with a great looking tropical shirt motif with palm trees and some card suit tattoos on his exposed lower arms. He has two expressions, both smiling of course, one closed mouth the other open, his legs are dual-moulded with some minor detailing for sandals on his feet, other than this there are no other print details to be found.</p>

<p>Overall, compared with Series 1&#39;s Arkham Joker who was also available in a set from The LEGO Batman Movie, this variant is a very good use of parts and highly welcome. Tropical Joker gets a Highly Recommended from me.</p>
