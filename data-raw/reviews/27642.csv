<p>Robin is dressed in green shorts with his logo on it and a Hawaiian style shirt with little birds all over, he has dual-moulded arms and legs for that perfect beach going look and is bringing a boombox and ice cream to the beach to stay cool. His expression is perfect, with an open mouth smile, and he even has little freckles on his cheeks. Granted all versions of Robin may have included that, but I&#39;m not sure I noticed before.</p>

<p>Overall a nice offering from the Series with some decent parts. Recommended.</p>
