<p>Vacation batgirl is a very bland figure and there is only one redeemable quality .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure has the normal two piece cowl and hair elements a bland face print and a plain wetsuit print on the torso and nice dual moulded .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>The Accessory are nothing much except the best part of the figure the Batman themed surf board is really cool just like the kandor in the jar released at the same time the stand is the printed Batman movie series two emblem such is always nice for Batman obsessives like myself .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this an ok figure with great accessory an unfortunate trait with many modern CMFs I would only recommend it for the surf board and that&#39;s about it .</p>

<p>Dressed in a stylish purple wetsuit complete with Bat logo, using a belt accessory, dual-moulding to great effect for her legs and arms and having an excellent expression choice for the character with her smirking confident look, Batgirl is awesome. She includes a yellow surfboard with Bat logo on it, that is just all around awesome and a great part, trying to get multiples of it alone was unfortunately fruitless at retail, but it&#39;s a great piece for any DC display.</p>

<p>Overall she&#39;s a very solid offering. I love the detail and look of her. Strongly Recommended.</p>
