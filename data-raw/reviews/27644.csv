As with the others he has dual-moulded arms and legs and is carrying a wine glass with cherry inside. Perhaps a fruity beverage or something stronger, let your imagination decide.</p>

<p>The white collar he has around his neck might not actually be a bow tie, I mentioned the oddness in my last Alfred review, but it&#39;s possible this is meant to represent a different type of accessory. A collar that is seen on most suit jackets and shirts. Alfred is smiling and has his bald-cap on of course, definitely an interesting look for the character.</p>

<p>I recommend him to complete the Vacation sub-set of Minifigures, however I would recommend getting more of the others first. If you want to make a plethora of LEGO City crooks in swim trunks, the skin tones might not match, but the parts are definitely worth tracking down. Recommended.</p>
