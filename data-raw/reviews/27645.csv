"Minifig290","2018-02-20T12:43:09.007Z","SHE IS MINDBLOWING","<p>Soccer Mom Batgirl is part of the LEGO Minifigures Batman Movie Series 2 and is either the best or one of the best from the 20 in the series and for &pound;3 she is one of the most price worthy figure from the series.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The figure herself is great. Her face print has a bat print on it. Her hat is an excellent mold that has a bat signal print and is nice and curve. She has a great tracksuit that has Batman&#39;s face with a yellow font text reading &quot;BATMAN FAN CLUB&quot; that could be used outside the Batman&nbsp;theme for a Batman&nbsp;fan or at a shop. Her cape and belt are the only parts that are not exclusive to the figure but are cool to get in a cheap set.</p>

<p><b>Accessories</b></p>

<p>There are&nbsp;only two accessories but they are some fantastic prints to represent bat money. Also there is a figure stand that has the Batman symbol printed on it.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To finish this review of a small figure i would recommend all Batman&nbsp;fans to get this figure and if you collect Minifigure series to get the entire series as well like I will.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Great exclusive prints for her 1x2 tiles, face, torso, legs and hat</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>Her cape hasn&#39;t got a cool fan club&nbsp;print on it and also the &pound;3 price is a hard pill to&nbsp; &nbsp; swallow</p>

<p>Soccer mom batgirl is a figure that I don&#39;t fully understand the title of but it is still one of my favourites of the series .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The hood is very nicely moulded and has a printed Batman emblem , the head has an inappropriate happy face and an appropriate annoyed face , the cape is just a standard Batman cape just smaller , the torso has nice front printing but nothing on the back , she has the standard belt in yellow and nicely printed legs and the arms are also very well printed .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>Her Accessories include two 1&times;2 printed black tile batbucks . Her stand is just the standard Lego Batman movie series two printed Batman emblem piece .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a great figure I just wish it had back torso printing however I still recommend it .</p>

<p>Batgirl is interesting, I think she&#39;s more liked for her parts than her actual overall look. Her face has a nice set of expressions with happy and angry looks, and she&#39;s carrying two Bat-Dollars, Batman&#39;s own currency. Even the utility belt piece has a use, but while the parts are nice I&#39;m still more partial to the complete Minifigure and this one is rock solid despite the poor choice in official names.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend her for the figure and strongly recommend her for the selection of parts. Strongly Recommended.</p>
