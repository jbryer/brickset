"Golem25","2018-08-01T14:35:32.8Z","A wonderful Reimagination","<p>As someone who has had a bit of a soft spot for Killer Moth since first seeing him in the original LEGO Batman game and grabbed the first real minifigure of this heinous villain off the aftermarket (for a hefty mark-up), I was happy to see everyone&#39;s favourite flutterer show up in the LEGO Batman Movie proper and now in the second series of collectible minifigures.</p>

<p>Given the hefty pricetag on the big set the OG Killer Moth minifig came in, it&#39;s good to know that everyone, regardless of budget, can now get the masked critter via the cheapest option available. Of course, as always, something good comes with a trade-off, which in this case is the figure having been made in LEGO&#39;s Chinese factories and thus being of sub-standard quality compared to Danish/Czech/Mexican parts. Will this affect my appraisal of this new Killer Moth, though? Read on to find out!</p>

<h3><strong>Packaging</strong></h3>

<p>As per always, the collectible minifigures come in blind bags made of a decently thick plastic that allows for both survival on the shelf and reasonable accuracy when using your digits to feel its contents for identification purposes. These standard-sized bad boys (if you&#39;ve ever seen and felt a blind bag from previous series, you will know what to expect) come in dark blue packaging, in keeping with the overall theme of Batman. A selection of figures find themselves under a starry sky with Gotham&#39;s skyline as a backdrop.</p>

<p>Pleasing for sure, but you will still want to rip the bag up to get to its precious contents. Do note that Killer Moth is one of 11 figures not to appear on the front of the packaging, having to let less desirable and less interesting characters such as Black Lightning steal the spotlight. Not a problem though, for the true connaisseur knows it&#39;s not the outside Killer Moth that counts, but the inside Killer Moth.</p>

<h3><strong>Build &amp; Parts</strong></h3>

<p>This section can perhaps be considered superfluous, for Killer Moth comes with just six pieces, which you can mash together for a finished product within ten seconds of opening your blind bag. That being said, Killer Moth is one of just seven figures out of 20 to have a part go around his neck, meaning that he is slightly more complicated than the majority. There are no subassemblies; it&#39;s the three usual pieces for the minifigure head to toe, a helmet, wings, and ray gun.</p>

<p>Taking a look at the parts themselves, we have three accessories of which two popped up in previous KM figs; the helmet was used for 76069 Mighty Micros and is endemic to Killer Moth (meaning this character and these two sets are the only ones to have ever included the antennae&#39;d helmet, made of bendy plastic), whereas the wings in this colour were used for both that set and 76054 Scare Crow Harvest of fear (endemic to KM and every set he has been in).</p>

<p>The third accessory, the ray gun, is only the second time this mold has popped up in a set, and is the first and only use of it in pearl gold; it made its debut in 71018 Retro Spaceman in pearl silver. Given this general rarity and the discontinued status of 71018, Killer Moth is your best bet at acquiring the ray gun, and thusly, is a more valuable set to have</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigure</strong></h3>

<p>KM&#39;s head, body, and legs are all new designs, and represent a decidedly more cartoony version of the character compared to the original in the Scarecrow set; there, Killer Moth had a double-sided head with medium nougat flesh colour under his helmet, with both a stern and frightened expression. Due to the short, stocky nature of the helmet used for this collectible fig, an alternative face couldn&#39;t be included, but this is no problem with 71020-12&#39;s serious expression mirroring the few seconds of screen time he got in the actual movie. The base is fully lime green, with the face painted on.</p>

<p>71020-12&#39;s torso is the third iteration of this part, and closely resembles the original whilst creating its own look through an altered belt, making it look more like cloth than leather. KM&#39;s impressive muscles are well-defined, and for imaginative play children should have no problems pitting this character in a fist fight without his ray gun. The value and collectability of this torso is increased through the fact that it is PURPLE (I know some AFOLs, myself included, have an unhealthy obsession with purple parts due to their rarity). The back printing is on point with more muscles and the belt continuing, but this is mostly covered up by the wings, which are a vital part of the character and add to his charm and uniqueness in this series.</p>

<p>The legs, finally, are another cartoonish pivot away from the original figure in 76054; that KM had simple orange/lime hooped pants, where this KM uses a red rather than orange waist piece, with triangular shapes on the legs representing tights; this is lovely, as the villain is campy and silly on his own, and thus a perfect fit for rather rudimentary tights to be added for extra hilarity. The tights also help to further visually distinguish the new figure from the old, meaning that collectors will really want to get this one to add to the collection, whilst owners of 76054 needn&#39;t feel pressured to skip this set. Rather than copy, 71020-12 Killer Moth creates its own niche as a campier alternative to the already somewhat silly 76054 version</p>

<h3><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></h3>

<p>Now this is a tough one for me, as I like Killer Moth as a figure and character. Seen as just his parts, the sum of them, and the finished product, you have a lovely minifigure here which is visually distinctive, comes with great and rare parts, and will draw attention to any build you chuck him into.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we would be foolish to look at 71020 Killer Moth as if it were to exist in a vacuum; there is a pricetag to worry about, as well as part quality considering this is a China-made figure. I will outright state that 4 USD/3GBP/4EUR is too much for these minifigures, especially when the earlier series went for 3 Euros per piece whilst I had to pay 4 Euros (minimum) for figures from recent series. Series 15 was the last to my knowledge that was priced at 3.50, whereas the price increase from 3 to 3.50 happened before then.</p>

<p>One can speak of increased production costs, quality, and inflation all they want, but the price is, plainly put, wrong. If these figures were completely made in the good factories (Denmark/Czech Republic/Mexico) I could overlook this to a degree (3.50 sounds decent enough value then), but these Chinese figures are simply not as good as the &#39;regular&#39;-made figs.</p>

<p>As such, I will have to award a low score for &#39;value for money&#39; and only a 4 for &#39;parts&#39;, which really should have been a 5. As a consumer I have the right to disagree with LEGO&#39;s manufacturing standards and pricing policy, and this is my expression of my continued discomfort with TLG&#39;s decisions.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I wholeheartedly recommend 71020-12 to most any LEGO fan; a fantastic selection of rare parts, a distinctive minifigure with a fresh take on a reasonably rare, expensive character, and an overall visual identity that has gone unparalleled since. When considering the full range of TLBM Series 2, I would also say that Killer Moth is perhaps one of the more desirable figures overall. 71020-16 Jor-El will no doubt fetch much higher prices on the aftermarket, making him ideal for scalping, whilst characters like Batman and the Joker have a wider appeal and others have some great parts (71020-6 comes with an actual factual Dolphin and 71020-10 has a lovely bathing suit), but there is no package in the mix as complete and distinct as 71020-12 Killer Moth.</p>

<p>Go to your local store, see if they still have these figures on offer, and feel your own Killer Moth out before they are removed from circulation!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-08T19:33:11.117Z","The Moth that Stalks in the Night.","<p><b>Set #71020 Killer Moth:</b>&nbsp;A fan-favourite villain to many this loveable Batman rogue is dressed in some truly epic costume. He has a soft rubbery piece with two antennae for his helmet, a printed face covering that is reminiscent of Batman&#39;s scowling expression, he wears a pair of bright orange wings, a purple outfit with a Moth logo on it and a sash belted around his waist. His legs are covered in stockings, and he carries a large golden ray gun.</p>

<p>Killer Moth is an excellent addition to the many villains of Gotham City, this is first incarnation and is a different look from how he was constructed in the original LEGO Batman Video Game, but overall a solid looking figure with some great detailing and the perfect foil for Batman. All he needs is the Mothmobile, the Mothwing and a Mothcave to store them in.</p>

<p>Highly Recommended.</p>
