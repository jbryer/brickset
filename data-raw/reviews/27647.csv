A team of powerful heroes have joined forces, and with them come two teenage superheroes, Jayna and Zan, twin aliens from an alternate planet or something like that who can assume the form and shape of anything when they touch. Often an element and an animal.</p>

<p>Jayna is the girl, dressed all in purple with a large J emblem on her chest, her print detail is quite nice and the half-collar cloth piece works almost perfectly. She has a bit of a problem keeping it up and it looks more like a tiny ridiculously undersized cape because it refuses to sit properly. At least for me, your mileage may vary. She includes a record and a printed 2x2 tile with the title 24 Party Songs. She appeared in the Fortress of Solitude Party scene, and she&#39;s brought the tunes.</p>

<p>Overall she looks great and I&#39;d definitely recommend her for any fans of the character. Recommended.</p>
