<p>Comes in normal CMS bag with normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure parts you get a dark grey bucket handle, light grey bucket and a trans blue stud with a sad face&nbsp;on it (Or Zan in his water form). And you get the CMS stand, except this time you get the Batman logo on it (which I really like). Overall decent parts for a CMS figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Wonder Twin Zan:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Zan has a single sided head with just a slight smile. The detail isn&#39;t bad and does a nice job of showing the expression. The hair piece is pretty cool. The ears on the side remind me of the&nbsp;elf hair pieces from The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit (just not as long). It is a nice hair piece to get. You get a hard cape around his that is purple. He has printing on to front and back of his torso and legs showing his suit. He has ab printing front of his torso and the belt is on both the front and back of the torso. On his legs the printing show his boots with a dark purple and a yellow trim showing it. Overall a good job on the printing and a decent figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a decent CMS figure. The detail on the torso, legs, and head are really well done. The accessory of the bucket with a custom water piece showing a sad face (or of&nbsp;him using his powers) was a good idea for this figure. Over all I recommend this figure if you are into or a fan of the CMS Lego Batman Movie figures, otherwise it isn&#39;t a must have. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

Aside from the difference in their prints to indicate which gender they are, the detailing is pretty much identical between both of them with Zan having more muscles and the Z insignia on his torso. All the same parts colours are used, with dual-moulded arms and legs for both twins.</p>

<p>Zan&#39;s accessory is a bucket and a single 1x1 tile with his face printed on it in clear blue indicating that he is now inside the bucket as water. A clever bit of fun as Zan can be carrying himself to the party. It might have been nice to have Gleek included, but the LEGO Monkey element has not been in use for some time and none of the Friends Animals would look right with these two.</p>

<p>Overall another solid offering and a must own figure for fans of the Super Friends! Highly Recommended.</p>
