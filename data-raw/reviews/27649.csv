That being said, if you grew up with the Super Friends, then Apache Chief is definitely a Minifigure for you. With some great looking detailing on the torso and legs, Apache Chief is an impressively detailed character, the re-use of the hippie hairstyle with bandanna is definitely a good choice. His accessory is a 1x3 printed tile with some sort of comical style misadventure. Showing Apache Chief having a great time and then suddenly being attacked by a monkey. I have no idea if this is a reference to something or what, but it could be a reference to Gleek.</p>

<p>It is odd seeing the Luthor face expression printed on a different coloured head though. I would recommend this for fans of the Super Friends, this entire Series has been a huge love letter to DC in general with some great character choices. Recommended.</p>
