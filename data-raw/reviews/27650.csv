This version represents the original Jor-El as played by Marlon Brando in design, though some of his detailing also appears to represent Comic Book Jor-El more closely as Brando did not have a beard, the costume printed on the torso and sloped leg brick is identical however with the S shield and the curious looking pattern running down the right side.</p>

<p>Jor-El includes a shoulder armour seen in the past with certain Classic Space era CMF figures, it features a small printed tile with the S shield on it. He carries a piece of blue crystal, possibly a reference to the crystals in the Fortress. It definitely is not Blue Kryptonite.</p>

<p>Overall, Jor-El is much appreciated here as it allows you to finally own the father of Superman. The S-Curl hairdo in white is also a nice touch, and so I recommend this Minifigure to all collectors and fans. Recommended.</p>
