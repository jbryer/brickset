"Odeinoichus","2020-12-09T17:57:08.333Z","Excellent Offering of Zod Puns.","<p><b>Set #71020 General Zod:</b>&nbsp;The most memeable moment in all of Superman History is when Terrence Stamp uttered his famous line in Superman Part II. This version of General Zod is that version. He is dressed in his black costume with the chest bearing opening and the Zod crest on his back, has a very suitable black hair piece from Peter Venkman and an excellent looking facial print.</p>

<p>The funnest part about this Minifigure is his printed newspaper tile. Apparently Kneel won an election in Gotham over Zod. It&#39;s a highly punny part and if I&#39;m not mistaken one of our only printed Gotham Newspaper covers to date. Overall I&#39;d strongly recommend picking up the original theatrical version of General Zod. Strongly Recommended.</p>
