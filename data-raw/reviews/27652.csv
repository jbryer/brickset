This minifigure features heavy details of a LEGO Skeleton printed on the torso, the legs, the arms (side-printing) and the face showing the hideously deformed being Phosphorus has become. The only thing missing would be the back of the skull, I&#39;m actually surprised they did not print this too, considering the amount of detail used to make the character.</p>

<p>Doctor Phosphorus includes two green flame effects, which he uses to simulate launching nuclear blasts at his foes. He is dressed in a pair of enhanced shorts preventing them from burning up, so he can at least wear some clothing. I can&#39;t help feeling this was an inspiration behind the main villain in Batman Beyond, but this represents the OG character.</p>

<p>Overall. Strongly Recommended.</p>
