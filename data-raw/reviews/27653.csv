<p>Black canary is not a lesser known DC superhero so it is shocking that this is her first and so far last minifigure appearance .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>This minifigures has the regular female hair piece in a cool yellow colour , a fairly bland forward facial expression but an incredible screaming alternative face which could relate to her canary cry from the comics or coincide with her accessory , her torso has a nice jacket print and her legs have nice printing with subsequent side leg printing .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>The Accessories include a 2&times;2 black small disk , a 1&times;3 black long bar , a black clip and a printed microphone print to make the stand and microphone , the stand is the Batman movie series two printed Batman emblem piece . In conclusion this is a very nice fig and the second face print really makes it worth while .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>coming from the opinion of an individual who loves new getting new DC characters as minifigures I would recommend this to DC fans and fans of interesting and cool minifigure pieces .&nbsp;</p>

The printed detailing of her costume is quite impressive, it&#39;d be more impressive if they used dual-moulding, sadly that was not the case.</p>

<p>Her blonde hair hides the fact that she has two expressions, one shouting her head off to unleash her power and the other with a plain smile. Carrying a microphone stand into battle seems a tad off, but maybe it&#39;s to amplify her sonic wail.</p>

<p>A nice offering and a solid figure with some great detailing. Highly Recommended.</p>
