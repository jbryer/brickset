This character can control lightning, and do a host of other things similar to The Flash, but he is not a Speed Force user.</p>

<p>This character uses The Flash&#39;s helmet, the rest of him is done up to match the animation model, and he looks pretty spiffy, with a large yellow bolt on his chest and two yellow boots thanks to his dual-moulded feet. He includes twin lightning effects to hold. He&#39;s a nice character for the Super Friends fans. I&#39;d recommend tracking one down if you like the character or want a complete Super Friends Roster on your shelf. Recommended.</p>
