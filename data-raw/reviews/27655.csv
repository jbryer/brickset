<p>This just comes in a thin bag with the instruction manual as the cover showing what the set looks like.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The only cool piece is the printed stand that the Lego and Star Wars logo on it. The piece total for this set is 20.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>Nothing hard at all took me under a minute to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>When I finished it I was really happy with this. Only thing I would say is the stand is not very sturdy at all and the ship falls off if you move it at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>My overall opinion is that this is a very good display item from Lego. Besides the stand not being as sturdy as I&#39;d like it is a really good micro scale Millenium Falcon. Which is why I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bag:&nbsp;</strong>It is just a plastic bag like normal micro builds. Nothing really special.</p>

<p><b>Instructions: &nbsp;</b>It is the front image of the set with a quick and small instructions on the back of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parts: &nbsp;</b>Of the 20 parts in the set, only 1 is unique. The base stand with the Lego Star Wars logo is cool, but should not get the set just for it.&nbsp;Lego could&rsquo;ve done better with part selection.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Build:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;The build is quick and easy. It takes about a minute to two, depending on how focused you are and your pace. Nothing challenging used, but have to watch when to turn the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Value:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;I got it on clearance, so&nbsp;it was a decent deal for it. I would not recommend it at its full price. Get it on sale if you can, if not, you are not missing much.</p>

<p><b>Overall:&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;It a okay set. It meant for being displayed. It has&nbsp;&nbsp;very low playability, unless you have other micro Star Wars vehicles to go with it. The only problem with it is too easy to tip over and an uneven base. The parts could be used for something else if you desire to do so.&nbsp;If it was a lower price, I would recommend it for collectors or people with lots of micro vehicles from Star Wars.&nbsp;</p>

"rbarnacle","2022-03-01T15:03:27.82Z","Perfect, small display","<p>The build of this set is rather easy. The stand consists of a printed baseplate with LEGO STAR WARS on it that comes across quite nicely. The ship itself hovers above with a translucent staff and is recognizable at well sized. It can be easily removed and flown around by hand or float nicely in place. It is a good scale and not overpowering on a desk. I have my displayed at my work and people notice it quite often. For the original price of $5 it was a bargain. Great set, and still sells around original price on Bricklink (as of 3/1/2022).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall great little set that reflects on the Star Wars saga in LEGO.&nbsp;</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-07T21:37:16.93Z","This set was $5!!!!!!!!!","<p>I cant believe that this set is $5. There is a mini model which is just a little more detailed then the ones in the advent calenders. The only good things in this set are the clear pieces that are used for the stand, and the printed Tile at the bottom says LEGO Star Wars. Most people would buy this set just to get those tiles. I recommend buying this set if they have them under a $1 because of that printed white plate at the bottom.</p>
