<p>As a creator set, the instructions booklet provides&nbsp;5 exemplar models to build, with extra ones online. They model different ways to use the gear pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With only one model being transport related (a helicopter), they provide a more imaginative use of technic parts which should help children use more moving parts in creative builds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>- wide range of colours</p>

<p>- springboard for builds with moving parts</p>

<p>- lots of fun</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>- wide range means fewer of each type</p>
