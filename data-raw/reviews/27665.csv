I doubt that anyone above age of 6 will find anything engaging about this set, except for two transparent domes. Pieces included are pretty basic&nbsp;and come in vast variety of colors, which I&#39;m not a big fan of, &#39;cause it&#39;s hard to build something monochrome. For example, there are only 10 green pieces.</p>

<p>The suitcase is made of, at least, two types of plastic (it&#39;s two halves are of different shade of yellow), barrier plates fit with difficulty and tend to get bendy. You can place them in two ways, making 4 identical sections. There&#39;s also two kinda-sections, which are connected with the handle and hence having lower&nbsp;brim and possibility to mix up. The lid doesn&#39;t shut tight and leaves gaps on both sides.</p>

<p>If you dump all bricks in it, there&#39;ll be some&nbsp;room left for the future pieces. And that&#39;s what this set is about, I guess, &ndash; &quot;My 1st Lego container I&#39;ll fill to the brim&quot;. Or possibly it can be used as a go-out set, in which kids can place their favorite stuff. In other words: &quot;it&#39;s all about suitcase&quot;.</p>
