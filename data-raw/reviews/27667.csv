I love building cars, Planes, and spaceships.&nbsp;&nbsp;I find that classic sets are great for basic parts. But this one is really good for It comes with a nice tire collection and other parts for building cars. I think that anybody who finds it at a good price should pick one up because I have spent 48 hours playing with this set over the weekend. I would highly suggest this set to any Lego classic fans, or fans who like creating.</p>
