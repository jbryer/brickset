"abordoli","2018-01-11T02:26:54.87Z","Just, OK.","<p>Kinda had to get this for &#39;completionists&#39; sake. Obviously it is a bendable version of the fixed wing version that was not as black as it should have been. At least they got the coloring &#39;more&#39; correct. The picture on the polybag hides a lot of the parts, for some reason, not seen. It does have the requisite weight to be hung as a flying decorative.<br />
<br />
I don&#39;t see it as having great playability and the cost-per-piece seemed a little skewed (not for the better). Its saving grace, for me, was that it was enjoyable to build and revealed more of this ship&#39;s design even though it is super-mini.</p>

"vikings","2018-12-24T05:55:44.577Z","Better than the First","<p>I do own the first one that came out in 2016 and I wasn&#39;t a big of a fan of it. I do really like this one more than the original one.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Box/Instruction Manual:</b></p>

<p>The set comes in the normal polybag&nbsp;showing the set on it. The instructions are the same small ones you get with every other polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parts:</b></p>

<p>The total piece count is 33 pieces. Nothing super special. There were two pieces that were pretty cool. The piece that is used as the hatch on the top of it and the pieces used as the cannons on the wings are neat additions to the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:</b></p>

<p>Very simple build nothing hard about it. Took me 1-2 minutes to build it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Complete Model:</b></p>

<p>Once it was finished I was really happy with it. The wings move outward so it resembles the actual shuttle. Personally I think it is better than the 2016 version.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>My overall opinion is this is the better of the two shuttles made. The wings are much better being able to bend outward looking more like the actual shuttle. In the end I&#39;m giving it a 5 star.&nbsp;</p>

It has smart piece choices that make this polybag&nbsp;have its own design. I would not go out of my way to get this, but I would pick it up in line at the Lego store.</p>

<p>This was my 6th build. Another disappointment. No mini fig is included. Very easy build. The wings move so that&#39;s something.&nbsp;</p>
