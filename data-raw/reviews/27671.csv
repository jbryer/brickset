<p>I&#39;ve missed out on a few polybags for dithering, such as <strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40078-1/Hot-Dog-Stand"">40078 Hot Dog Stand</a></strong> from 2013.&nbsp; This wasn&#39;t going to be one of them.&nbsp; And I&#39;m so very happy I chanced a bite.<br />
<br />
<strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Yep.&nbsp; Included.&nbsp; I&#39;ll keep the instructions, and toss the bag.&nbsp; Though, I wonder if something that could be more easily recycled would be better than a plastic bag.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Always happy to get another hot dog bun.&nbsp; Plus I can always steal the one that is brilliantly used for advertising on the top of the spinning umbrella.<br />
<br />
I&#39;ve not seen the printed tile used on a street vendor before, but it adds a nice touch of realism with a cheap and plentiful part.</p>

<p>I think the wheel chair wheels look great.&nbsp; The trans-black preparation tray is another excellent detail.</p>

<p>And who&#39;s going to argue against getting another green garbage can?&nbsp; No one worth listening to, that&#39;s who.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The chef is nothing super exciting, but neither is he offensive.&nbsp; I&#39;m always for variety, and I&#39;m not sure if I have another chef with this face, so, yay!<br />
<br />
Dream chef: One with the magnificent moustache&nbsp;of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71018-4/Corn-Cob-Guy""><strong>Corn Cob Guy</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>It was not a complicated build, but that&#39;s not unexpected in a polybag.&nbsp; This, however, has the best play feature I can remember in such a small set - the spinning umbrella.&nbsp; If you build it with just a bit of space between the axle holder and the bushing, the gear will spin against the tire as the wheels move.&nbsp; It makes the hotdog on top rotate, and I think that&#39;s adorable.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a feature for which I can happily sacrifice extra hotdog storage, such as that on the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8398-1/BBQ-Stand""><strong>8398 BBQ Stand</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model / Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>Get it.&nbsp; Just get it.&nbsp; If you are wondering, &quot;Should I spend $6 on this?&quot;&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Yes you should!&nbsp; Your LEGO City citizens are just getting out of the bar, and they need some street meat.</p>

"Minifig290","2018-02-04T19:05:36.867Z","Best City Polybag In A Long While","<p>I got this set from LEGO shop at home for free and i was extremely pleased with it. There is nothing wrong with this set what so ever everything is great.</p>

<p>The figure is a chef and he is simple but cool, his face print is the same as the one included in the Fun At The Park and Pizza Van set and it is always nice to get as it is very useful. His hat and torso and&nbsp;legs are&nbsp;simple and nothing to exciting.</p>

<p>There are two side builds a green bin which is always nice to get and a hot dog which is a&nbsp;great piece which is getting easier to find also there is a hook to hold the sausage.</p>

<p>The hot dog stand itself is flawless and is brilliant, it has a grill to cook the sausages on and a bit of space to assemble the hot dog and two spouts that represent Ketchup and Mustard dispensers. The cover uses the tops of the carts of the Ferris Wheel set released in 2015&nbsp;in yellow, with a hot dog that can turn when the cart is moving.</p>

<p>Overall this poly bag is worth buying online as it has great parts like the hot dog buns and the mini figure parts are greats. Definitely a great poly bag and probably the best City poly bag ever.</p>

"J14T14","2018-03-13T13:48:27.107Z","Hot Diggity Dog","<p>I found ths set in the Easter section at my local Target and I decided to pick it up since it looked fun. It comes with one minifigure, a hot dog chef, a trashcan, and a hot dog cart.</p>

<p>The minifigure&nbsp;is a lot like some more recent LEGO&reg; City chef&#39;s. It has the same head and torso as the&nbsp;Hot Dog Vendor from 60134 and&nbsp;Pizza Van Chef from 60150. This is a little annoying, but it is still nice to have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hotdog cart is a nice little build. There is a gear at the bottom of the rod that holds up the umbrella&nbsp;and you can use that to spin the umbrella and the hot dog on top of it. There are some grill pieces on top to act as, well, a grill. There are two nozzles at the end for mustard and ketchup. It is nice to get two of the newer hotdog but pieces in such a cheap set. The green trashcan included is nothing new, but it is still a nice inclusion. The best part about this set has to be the two wheelchair wheel pieces, which have only come in 4 other sets, this one being the cheapest way to get them.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a pretty nice set to get. I would recommend this to anyone who just wants a little build to add to your collection or have a little build in a LEGO city.</p>

"Lego_fan_","2020-01-10T14:00:21.52Z","Hot dogs!","<p>Lego set #30356 is a great addition to any Lego city and is needed to keep those Minifigures&nbsp;from having an empty tummy.</p>

<p>This set includes a hot dog vender, a trash can, and a hot dog vender stand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigure is nothing new just the standard torso. But the head print is nice.</p>

<p>The hot dog vender stand is real cool. It includes a grill, heat dial, condiment&nbsp; area.</p>

<p>The set also has a function where when you move the cart the umbrella turns on top.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall i think that this set&nbsp; is a must have for any Lego city and is a fun little build.</p>

"Brentski","2019-01-07T00:32:13.973Z","Get yer dogs","<p>As a more recent legoer, I look for small sets that can help relax me for a few minutes. The hot dog cart fits well with several of my long- term set up plans. And all the little extras are&nbsp;nice.</p>

"vikings","2020-05-22T06:52:11.22Z","Hot Dog Stand","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in normal polybag with normal polybag sized instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some decent pieces in this set. You get 3 hotdogs, 2 hotdog buns, 1x2 tile with printed&nbsp;gauge, bicycle tires&nbsp;x2, and a green trashcan. Overall a very nice piece haul for this polybag. The total piece count is 43.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hot Dog Chef:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The hot dog Chef has the&nbsp;traditional Lego city minifigure feel and look to him. He has a single sided head. He has a big brown moustache which looks really good. He has a chef shirt printed on the front and back of his torso. He has plain black legs. He has tonges and a hotdog as his accessories.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice city polybag. The hot dog stand is very good. It&nbsp;moves smoothly when you roll it around. You have a grill and condiments that complement the stand very good. The umbrella stand has a gear that allows to spin it. You also have a garbage can which is a nice addition as well. The Chef is a nice figure with decent detail. I highly recommend getting this set to add to your Lego or Lego city collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"C_R_Studios","2020-02-11T01:47:08.653Z","The best lego city polybag","<p>This is the perfect city polybag. I&#39;m glad to see that it is not another police buggy like we usually expect. This has a great figure to go along with the build. If I have one gripe it would be that the trash can is really pointless.</p>
