This is overall a great little set, the model looks like a single yellow flower in a pot/vase, possibly a daisy or daffodil though I&rsquo;m not sure it&rsquo;s meant to represent any sort of flower. So I strongly recommend this set, it&rsquo;s a great looking flower and will look really nice to other sets in a similar scale, such as the Ideas Birds set that came out a while ago.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Minifig290","2018-08-26T14:47:51.657Z","Great Display And Well Built","<p>Hello all, today i&rsquo;ll be looking at probably my favourite Friends polys of 2018 the Friendship Flower that contains 100 parts and was a giveaway at Smyths&nbsp;in August but can be purchased from LEGO Shop for &pound;3.99 it was available at Target for $3.99 giving a very good Price Per Part of 3p or 3c.</p>

<p>Lets look at this poly.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The build is a fairly simple build of a plant pot with a flower in, i&rsquo;ll break up the pot from the flower and look at each separately.</p>

<p><strong>Plant Pot:&nbsp;</strong>The plant pot is made of a lot of SNOT techniques. There are 4 panels which 3 are identical with just 6 parts then a 4th which has a purple heart on using a total of 7 parts. Holding the panels are 8 1x1 light blue bricks with studs on 2 sides, they hold the pot together very well. To finish the pot off there&rsquo;s a 2x2 round brown brick to represent soil.</p>

<p><b>Flower Stalk:&nbsp;</b>The stalk of the flower is a strong and sturdy 4 price build that attaches to the pot and flower extremely well, it just uses 3 round 1x1 lime green bricks and a large brown minifigure sized bar that goes through the three bricks and attaches into the hole of the 2x2 round brick in the pot and a 2x2 round plate on the flower head.</p>

<p><strong>Flower Head:&nbsp;</strong>The flower head uses up the remaining parts, it has 16 petals which use three different builds. The first petals have a Qty of 8 and use just 2 parts each a 1x1 orange plate with a horizontal&nbsp;clip and a orangey yellow slope. The second petal has a Qty of 4 and use 4 parts a yellow slope on a 1x1 yellow plate and 1x1 white&nbsp;plate&nbsp;with a&nbsp;horazotal&nbsp;clip on a inverted slope. Finally the 3rd type of petal also uses 4 parts and is similar to type 2 but uses a 1x1 yellow plate with a vertical&nbsp;clip.</p>

<p>Each 16 petals are connected to two&nbsp;2x2 round plate with 8 minifig&nbsp;sized bar handles. There are 3 2x2 round plates in brown for some pollen&nbsp;detail and a 2x2 round plate in spring green that attaches firmly to the stalk.</p>

<p><strong>Drop Test Results</strong></p>

<p>I&rsquo;d thought i&rsquo;d test the builds sturdiness by drop testing it so let&rsquo;s get the results</p>

<p><strong>Drop 1:&nbsp;</strong>From waist height the build didn&rsquo;t even show signs of braking the only mentionable thing was the petals&nbsp;just moved.</p>

<p><strong>Drop&nbsp;2:&nbsp;</strong>From Chest height the same happened except&nbsp;one petal fell off.</p>

<p><strong>Drop 3:&nbsp;</strong>Finally from head height the flower was very much destroyed but only the heart fell off the pot.</p>

<p>______________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Well that was fun. Anyway to finish off the build is very sturdy and detailed. It&rsquo;s worth the &pound;3.99 or $3.99 price and is very much worth the value, I&rsquo;d recommend this to anyone no matter on gender or there thoughts on LEGO. Only little thing to mention is it&rsquo;s not very fun to play with but that&rsquo;s because it&rsquo;s a display piece.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Worth the value, Great appealing build, More sturdy than I&rsquo;d expected.</p>

<p><strong>Cons-</strong>&nbsp;None to mention bar maybe the lack of play features but that&rsquo;s cause it&rsquo;s a display so it&rsquo;s just a minor complaint.</p>

<p>(LEGO shop UK and Europe all have this for &pound;3.99, Smyths stores might have some remaining) :)</p>

"Lego_fan_","2020-01-07T20:52:20.02Z","a Colorful set","<p>Lego set #30404 is a beautiful little set to own and is great to not only a Lego Friends collection but also to any other Lego fan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is that set that you need on your desk or night stand to keep your rooms look fun and colorful. Are you a guy like me? You can swap out the colors if your not a fan of pink although i think it is fine as is. Also this&nbsp;set, even though they are fake flowers, still gives off a heavenly oder of mold release and fresh plastic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only play function in this set is movable petals to make it look alive! Or droopy and dead.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If your in need of brightening your rooms up this is the perfect set for&nbsp;you.&nbsp;</p>

"LupePower","2019-05-20T02:23:45.84Z","Beautiful Flower","<p>I really enjoyed this set. It was very fun to build and makes an excellent decoration/display piece. I love the little heart on the front and the design of the flower.&nbsp;You can not really play with this, but if you took it apart you could build some neat things. I would&nbsp;suggest this set to anybody who loves Lego and flowers!</p>
