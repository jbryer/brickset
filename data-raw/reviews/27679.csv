"KruxBricks","2018-02-13T05:11:15.653Z","Basic but nice","<p>30351 Sons of Garmadon is one of the three polybags released in Ninjago&#39;s spring 2018 line. It may not look that impressive, but is a great addition to your S.O.G. villain army!</p>

<p>The set includes only one minifig, an unnamed Sons of Garmadon member. He has basic black legs and a common Sons Of Garmadon torso, which also appears in two other sets. The face print is the same one seen with many Shark Army soldiers last year. The helmet is also really common. But overall, this guy looks great and gives you some nice variety to your S.O.G biker army, having different face than the ones seen in the sets.</p>

<p>The build of the bike is quick and easy. It has still some nice parts, like the purple fangs (you get a spare one too!) and the red katana swords. Also some Technic pieces are included (you rarely see those in polybags.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final model looks cool, though it doesn&#39;t have any play features. It still rolls really well and kids are gonna love it. The design of the bike is completely different than the ones seen in the sets, so it&#39;s a great addition to any S.O.G. biker army, or just a regular motorbike gang.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a really nice set for $/&euro; 4 and I recommend it!</p>

Cool combo of previously released parts to make another Official Lego minifig!<br />
<br />
RED SWORDS!!!</p>

<p>One of these dudes will look cool enough among your Garmy, but imagine 10 or 20 of them flooding the highway!!! At that point, a pretty rad following for Killow!!<br />

RED SWORDS!!!!!!!<br />

Awesome little addition to the baddies for the price of a minifig&nbsp;blind bag.</p>

I mean the same can be said of most Polybags that make rideable vehicles for Minifigures, but since this model uses Technic elements I&rsquo;m fairly justified in my assessment. That being said if you&rsquo;re interested in getting an army of little bikes and generic bikers for the Ninja to fight this one is definitely worth picking up. Mildly recommended for that reason.</span></span></span></span></p>

"Master_Wu","2019-10-22T03:37:29.047Z","Awesome Bike!","<p>This Ninjago SOG bike is an awesome set!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: The use of technic in this set made it quite an enjoyable build.</p>

<p>The minifigure: This biker minifigure&nbsp;is mostly generic; he has plain black legs, the usual SOG biker torso, and an angry face. He does however, have a very cool helmet with some big night vision glasses!</p>

<p>Overall: This set was a fun build that was worth the price. I highly recommend it!</p>
