"Minifig290","2018-02-20T12:30:42.01Z","Cute Little Polybag","<p>This set is one of the best creator polybags, because it is the first 3 in 1&nbsp;polybag ever (from what remember) so this poly is a unique set from&nbsp;that aspect. This poly was available from TESCO for &pound;4 in February&nbsp;2018 along with 4 others so this is a fairly&nbsp;common set as there is more than likely a TESCO supermarket within 10 miles of any UK place.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>There are two builds in this set. The pug is the main build in this set (and i&#39;m calling the pug Terry) and is a smaller build than i first expected but it makes since&nbsp;cause pugs aren&#39;t that big themselves. The pugs face can tilt left or right and his tongue is sticking out and his eyes can look anywhere. His two rear legs can move forwards and backwards to make it look like he is relieving himself.</p>

<p>Also in the set there is a fire hydrant, there isn&#39;t any play feature on the hydrant itself but you can make the pug look like his messing around it.</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>There aren&#39;t really any interesting pieces but some cool parts to get are the pugs eyes and a red 2x2 round brick with a technic hole going through it vertically which i haven&#39;t seen before but i think it has been released before</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is a great polybag and for only &pound;4 its better than the cheapest 2018 city police set. It has two great fun builds and takes only minutes to assemble. I would recommend this set to anyone who wants to start collecting LEGO or Creator sets as it is a small 3 in 1 set that is easy to build.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Easy to build, Great builds, cheap and easy to obtain and has decent parts</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>None To Mention</p>

"ninbricks","2018-04-04T13:52:46.76Z","sudden surprise, finding the cute pug ","<p>I first saw that nice and nasty pug here on brickset, and I knew I had to have it! As an AFOL and a fan of Loriot and his famous quote &quot;a life without pugs is possible, but pointless&quot;, I really dig that set. And on the other hand, it gives me a smile, when I remember it is a toy for kids, and what kind of adult may give a peeing-dog-toy to a kid as a gift!?</p>

<p>My local LEGO-Store in Hamburg couldn&#39;t tell me where or when this set will be released, they even assumed it could be a gift you get, when you buy stuff at the store to a certain amount. Or that it could be a set for so called &quot;target-markets&quot;. But they couldn&#39;t say which or where. Quite bad communication LEGO, ...but back to the pug.</p>

<p>I found this pug by surprise at my local &quot;rewe&quot;-store for 3,- &euro;. Other polybags were also available, but not in my focus. So all you german pug-fans out there, hurry up, the pug won&#39;t be there for a long time!!! Its a nice little build and the result looks really nice. I really enjoy the details like the curling tongue, twisting head an the little tail on the back. You can even put him into a sitting pose.</p>

<p>There is only the building instruction for the pug inside the polybag. The instructions for the other two animals must be downloaded from the LEGO-homepage. One could complain about it but on the other hand you can try to build them by the pictures on the polybag alone. I really recommend this set to all of you, who have a good sense of humor and like brick built animals.</p>

Still I&rsquo;d recommend it, Creator is a fun imaginative theme that allows you to build anything to your heart&rsquo;s content, so you can&rsquo;t go wrong with any of the sets LEGO has to offer, they&rsquo;re great for learning new build techniques and featuring fun or unique models.</span></span></span></span></p>

<strong>Model</strong><br />
<strong>Part I: Pug</strong><br />
Main model is of course a pug. I used to called him &quot;puppy&quot;, though he has a specified breed. He&#39;s got two moving legs (both rear) and can rotate his head. I&#39;d like to say that it is an adorable set. Pug looks so cute and is designed with a great dose of precision. He looks just like a living creature. His head is done pretty well, I like a tongue built out of 1x1 with a loop clip. He has a printed eyes which gives him a very intelligent look. His tan fur, white belly and black muzzle looks lovable.<br />
As an additions LEGO gives us a little fireplug for everybody knows what. It looks simple and good.</p>

<strong>Part II &amp; III: Emu &amp; Koala</strong><br />
Both those models don&#39;t look on the animal they portrait. Emu is for me like some kind of goose and &quot;koala&quot; reminds me of nothing in particular. They are interestingly designed, especially emu, which is built on side, and look sweet, but for me are not exactly what they should be. But I have to admit, that when koala have something in his arms, he start to reminds this little bear.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong><br />
Many curve bricks. Most parts are in tan, which is fine, but this color is not especially useful as a main color in building. Printed eyes are nice touch, and 1x1 with claw to the down and 1x1 corner highlight in tan are great.&nbsp;</p>
