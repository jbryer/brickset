Anyway, on to the review.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: Justice League boxes are a dark colour, not exactly black but certainly in that same colour wheel. Aquaman&rsquo;s logo is shown on the side of the box instead of the on-screen image we&rsquo;ve gotten used to with BrickHeadz packaging.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: Again the manual works well with all the easy to follow steps on the colorful pages, you can easily follow along with these steps, but the folded in half manual is a bit tricky to keep open when building on a table or other surface.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set includes a LEGO trident element and a nice printed tile for Aquaman&rsquo;s torso piece. We also get to see the Series 2 tile, which is a piece LEGO seems to have phased out as the 2018 year waned; this makes it a fairly rare element to get if you&rsquo;re interested in using them outside of the primary model use. Really good brown elements included too for Aquaman&rsquo;s hair elements.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There is some really nice pearl gold elements used for Aquaman&rsquo;s armour and the build is pretty impressive when it comes to making the hair style favored by Aquaman in the movie, especially the beard. Very fun build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Aquaman looks powerful and strong even as a blocky character built out of bricks; the hair and beard on him really looks neat with few visible studs. His trident element is not the standard gold colour, but more of a metallic looking black, and he includes some nice printed tile elements for his armour and belt buckle. A solid little model much as every other BrickHeadz sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">If you&rsquo;re a fan of BrickHeadz I strongly suggest you get the sets based on characters you like and skip anything that isn&rsquo;t to your liking. That being said the DC and Marvel characters are often extremely impressive and seeing them together on the shelf is a real treat. This set is also a great parts pack for MOC fans looking for cheap parts. Strongly recommended.</p>
