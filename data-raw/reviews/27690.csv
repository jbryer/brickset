<p>The build&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>The build is a little bit flat for brickheadz&nbsp;but there isn&rsquo;t much lego could do to make him look perfect. I like the minecraft wood colour&nbsp;for his skin. I think the pack is the most interesting with those iron bar pieces. His gun is a little bit flimsy but it holds if you don&rsquo;t play with it.</p>

<p>I think this build is a pretty good build with minor faults in my opinion,&nbsp;but others will say different. They should of included the minifigure&nbsp;of the brickhead, they would sell much more!</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-08T16:45:43.19Z","BOOYAH!","<p>This brickhead was one of the earlier brickheadz to be released. It was one of the better ones though. His right arm has a cool build for his arm with a cannon on the end. His torso is pretty bland and only has the torso prints as detailing. His&nbsp; legs look like he has extra armor there which is nice. Most of the detail in the set though is in the head. They did a really good job when showing how the metal meets his skin and how e has little hair left. It just really makes him look like a cyborg. Overall this was a very good early brickhead. I would suggest picking this up if you are a fan of the DC Universe or like the DC LEGO sets.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-11-07T11:48:07.627Z","Motherblocks Master","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #41601 Cyborg:</b> It&rsquo;s time to discuss another BrickHeadz set, wow, have I reviewed over twenty of these by now? Yep, and by and large they are all pretty similar in their overall design and general like of the set. Interestingly I never noticed before this is a 10+ set, I don&rsquo;t know, I feel someone in the 6-9 age range might be able to build these too. I could be wrong though.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Cyborg stands out on the front of this pack, it calls him out as Series 2 #24. A shot of the character from Justice League is on the side&hellip; wait&hellip; nope, just a shot of the Mother Box symbol. Was that the same as Aquaman? Oh no, each character has their own logo. Cyborg&rsquo;s shining red eye symbol resembles the Mother Box symbol seems to be related somehow. I kind of prefer the Marvel Characters on the side shots. I wonder why LEGO and WB didn&rsquo;t want them to be represented here. This packaging design actually is weaker than I initially thought when compared to others.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Large Headlight bricks and some printed Cyborg specific armour plates are the watch word of this parts list. There&rsquo;s a few dark tannish plates for Cyborg&rsquo;s dark skin tone, I think this is a rare colour for these parts and something you might want for some of your builds. This use here for the skin tone is really impressive though.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build &amp; completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with most Brickheadz the build is relatively the same, I say relatively because this figure does have a different arm design. I think this was the best aspect of this build, while the rest is still enjoyable it can get a tad repetitive to build BrickHeadz, even when we love the heck out of them. Cyborg once finished looks extremely impressive, with the single glowing eye and the printed eye.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">His right arm is built and designed to resemble a blaster cannon, which is great because it uses two of the gold elements in standard LEGO grey to represent the cannon barrel. This is a great design idea and I wouldn&rsquo;t mind seeing more of this in the future for BrickHeadz, different arm builds for different characters to give them something a tad more unique when next to their companions. There are at least five of the grey gold brick elements for details on Cyborg, two others on his back and one on his regular arm.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Cyborg is one of the BrickHeadz that hung around longer than his allies, Flash, Wonder Woman and Aquaman seem to have sold better. I&rsquo;m not sure why, Cyborg looks pretty boss and I can just hear him shouting Booyeah while firing on some enemies. If you still see him at retail I&rsquo;d recommend him for fans of the line, although at this point I suspect most folks who wanted him probably bought him. I kind of wish LEGO would re-issue some BrickHeadz, I wouldn&rsquo;t mind getting a few more that have retired, maybe make alternate costume versions to take advantage of such a thing. Recommended.</p>
