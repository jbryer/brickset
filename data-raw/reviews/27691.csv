It is a very fun build. There are a few mistakes in the directions, but not a big deal. Just tells you that you need a piece when you actually don&#39;t. Everything from the color scheme to the working suspension is great. Naturally, the first complaint from people will be that it isn&#39;t rc. For someone like me who just displays his sets, that is not a problem. For just over $100, this set is an excellent value.</p>

"frost1989","2018-07-21T14:47:33.817Z","When the B model looks more awesome than the A's","<p>At first glance, this technic race car really caught my attention greatly, fantastic sources of pieces, tag along with flashy stickers and huge size, makes it one of the most pretty set in 2018 Spring set.</p>

<p>This set comes with easy and fun built, huge space intact provides enough space for rc mod, but there&#39;s one thing I gotta complaint, while the front side looks astonishingly cool, but the back side is total in opposition, it looks so dull and less attractive without a decent stickers for decoration, thus makes the entire car looks a bit half cooked.</p>

<p>What I loved the most about this set is the b model, you gotta love this second built race buggy, some might say it is even prettier than the a model itself, I gotta agree, the dark azure mixed with white color tone does much greater job on the buggy rather than the race car.</p>

<p>I bought this set simply because for pieces sourcing, but I will recommend this set for technic beginners or people who love cool Lego Technic car, one simply couldnt resist the color matching and the big size of this latest race car from Technic line up.</p>

"Duq","2019-03-26T01:49:41.847Z","Style over substance","<p>Like many others I pretty much wanted this set as soon as I saw the images. So when I recently saw it reduced to just over &euro;70 I decided to get it. Was it a good purchase? Well... I guess the title kinda gives away the answer, doesn&#39;t it?</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>If you&#39;ve built larger Technic cars before then this will feel familiar. A bit of the chassis, each axle, an engine and then the body. There are no innovative constructions but it&#39;s complex enough to keep experienced builders occupied. It&#39;s the details that make the build fun, like headlights and rollcage.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are about 1000 parts in this set. There appears to be a lot of dark azur but in fact there are only 50 parts in that colour. Like most Technic sets a large portion of the parts are pins, about 350. What should have worried me is that there aren&#39;t even 10 gears in the set...</p>

<p>There are no unique parts but some rare ones, like the azure panels and the wheels and suspension parts.</p>

<h3>Looks</h3>

<p>In the flesh the car looks as good as in the pictures. The stickers help but are not essential. It has some nice details like the extra lights on the front, the fire extinguisher inside and the shaping of the rear, using angled panels to create a diffuser and a rear wing. The only diappointment are the wheel arches, they are quite square.</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>This is where trouble starts. It&#39;s a rally car. They don&#39;t have many functions, and this struggles with them. It&#39;s got an engine, but no gear box and the engine is a&nbsp;V6. Quite unusual for a rally car but let&#39;s go easy on that point, most Lego cars have a V6. It also doesn&#39;t have 4-wheel drive, pretty much a must-have on any rally car nowadays.</p>

<p>It&#39;s got steering, but as with most Technic sets this century the steering wheel doesn&#39;t move. Another common problem is that the turning circle is enormous.</p>

<p>Finally the bonnet and doors open on a simple&nbsp;hinge and the rear engine cover lifts. Weirdly, as you lift the rear, the wheel arches turn outwards. Not something I&#39;ve ever seen on a rally car.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>She&#39;s got the looks, but not much beyond that. It&#39;s all a bit average; not a bad build, but nothing spectacular. It&#39;s got a few functions, but it&#39;s missing some essentials ones. Some nice parts, but nothing unique or very special. It&#39;s swooshable (or vroomable) even if the steering is rubbish.</p>

<p>Great looking set; fun build; relatively quick; not to technical; moving parts in main areas; looks good on the shelf; would be fun to play with.</p>

<p>Full Build Review</p>

<p>This&nbsp;set was a really fun build. I haven&rsquo;t done a #technic set in years but this one has inspired me to look at what else is out there at the moment.</p>

<p>At 1005 pieces it is not huge and only took about 4 hours (in between watching the tv) to build.</p>

<p>The instructions are fairly clear with only a few pictures requiring a harder look to work out where the pieces needed to go and overall the parts fit together nicely.</p>

<p>While the end product looks good, there are a few areas where some of the gaps probably could have been filled with pieces a little better to give a more seamless look but that is pretty common with technic builds.</p>

<p>The front wheels move and can be turned by the air vent cog on the roof which is nice and is really great for play, driving it round the floor, but it&rsquo;s a shame they are not linked to the steering wheel.</p>

<p>The doors open to reveal a well detailed interior including racing seats and a fire extinguisher. The bonnet opens to reveal the fans and the rear hatch opens to reveal the engine. As the hatch opens it actually moves the rear side skirts / panels to give a nice open view of the engine which was a great touch.</p>

<p>The alternate build instructions for this kit do not come in the box and are only available online. The alternate build is for a dune buggy which looks nice in the pictures so I may have to pull this apart soon and compare that build as well.</p>

<p>Overall a fun and relaxing build that is going to go nicely in the display cabinet and probably get some vroom vroom time around the floor as well.</p>

"KarolWes","2019-12-13T14:04:06.45Z","Huge speed car","<p>Technic is one of the hardest series, and one that has the biggest models. But it is also known for having many repeting sets. I not like this series very much, but thanks to Zbudujmy.to LUG I&#39;ve got this one. And I must admit, it is a great set.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p><em>(Please note, that I didn&#39;t apply any sticker)</em></p>

<p>As title says, this car is huge. It barely fit on my closet. It is designed very well. It&#39; main attribute of Technic model, they are very detailed and close to originals. This is no exception. I like the way they made a hood and front. It looks very distinguished. Underneath the hood you can find pair of fans. Stripe of lights at mask adds a lot to overall look of model. Fenders are for me a little bit to low, which makes a suspension work a bit worse. Suspension is independent on each wheel. Doors opened up, inside the cabin you can find two seats, simple steering wheel, bottle with nitro. Also inside there is a cage, to prevent the roof from broking down. At the roof there is a small gear that steers a front wheels. The radius of turn is quite big, but it doesn&#39;t bother at all. At the back, whole roof can be open up, and thanks to series of levers, it also makes side panels open, which give a great look into the engine. Engine is typical to Technic V6 with standard yellow pistons. I wish they came back to the old good gray ones. Engine is made good, and works smoothly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this model looks perfect. It seams heavy and though really fast, just like it should. Colors works great. If you aren&#39;t a fan of stickers, you don&#39;t have to apply it. There are I think three, that completes patern made from bricks, rest just adds some signs or tag. For me they are totally unnecessary. Without them model looks simple, not too plain, just good.</p>

<p>Building process of most Technic set is a big thing, also in this set. Making it took me around 2.5 hour which is way over my standarts. There are some more interesting moments, especially when it comes to make a trunk, but other than that it is fairly simple yet labor-intensive.</p>

<p><strong>Model v2</strong></p>

<p>Nearly every single (if not all) Techic set gives you an opportunity to make a second model, based on an instruction available on-line. In this case, alternative model is desert buggy.&nbsp;&nbsp;During building this car didn&#39;t appeal to me much. It feels like it missing something. But at the end, it wend out fantastic. First of all, it is much smaller than rally car. It has less functions that main model. Steering wheels, as well as suspension works better thanks to higher fenders. Trunk has a little opening door to reveal pair of fans, just like in main model. Engine is also present, but you barely can see it. Cabin interior is simple, yet nice looking. Two pairs of lights at the top looks nice, as well as narrow hood. Also, long crossing beams at the side are great detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>As I said, I&#39;m not really into Technic, so I may have specific opinion on parts. There are some, that seems quite useful to me - MOC designer. The most valuable are of course panels - there are over 30 of them in many sizes and shapes. Also red wheels looks great. And I finally got newer version of differential. There aren&#39;t many gears, but we got a gear rack used in steering mechanism. For suspension element are extremely useful too.</p>
