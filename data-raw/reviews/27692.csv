<p>This review has not been written with the set 42075 available:</p>

<p>When I saw first released pictures from the set end of november 2017 I tried to build the car from these to get an impression. Modeling of the outer shell was easy but I couldn&#39;t figure out the bits that provide the transmission from rear axle to the motor and steering.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42075/03_img_7289k.gif"" /></p>

<p>When the digital version of the building instructions had been&nbsp; released&nbsp; I decided to start over and built from my available parts instead of buying the set.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>The build process untypically starts with the steering input. It is build onto a 5 x 11 open frame that also holds the transmission. The front axles then is assembled around a second frame. You will noticed that steering angle is restricted in a twofold manner (see also below). The two module are then combined by stacking them.</p>

<p>The rear axle is next. Suspension is provided by means of a single spring element. The setup somehow reminds me of early set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8845-1"">8845</a>. Thus the chassis is already completed (step 51) and can be pushed around:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.boverhaus.de/~fafnir/foren/brickset/42075/IMG_7352k.gif"" style=""width: 640px; height: 407px;"" /></p>

<p>There are four blue 1/2 pins used in module of the rear axle that do not serve any function. The only purpose could be to ensure the correct attachment of the axle to the chassis.</p>

<p><img alt=""Steering angle"" dir=""ltr"" id=""Top view of chassis with full steer angle"" src=""http://www.boverhaus.de/~fafnir/foren/brickset/42075/IMG_7354k.gif"" style=""width: 640px; height: 419px;"" /></p>

<p>Then, the vertical pillars behind the drivers cabin is setup. Horizontal beam are attached to that which will form the equipment compartment. This is done without second support.</p>

<p>The next steps are then</p>

<ul>
	<li>cockpit with steering wheel + doors</li>
	<li>winch at the front</li>
	<li>two-cylinder boxer motor</li>
	<li>front hood</li>
	<li>roof of drivers cabin</li>
	<li>the second compartment flap door</li>
	<li>and finally the finish for the rear.</li>
</ul>

<p>The picture gives an impression of the model:</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Steering by HOG</li>
	<li>Transmission from rear axle via differential to two-cylinder motor</li>
	<li>Suspension on rear axle</li>
	<li>Winch on front</li>
	<li>Doors on drivers cabin can be opened</li>
	<li>Front hood can be opened</li>
	<li>Equipment compartment with flap doors</li>
	<li>Lamp post folds up from compartment and can be pointed 360&deg;</li>
</ul>

<h3>Parts review</h3>

<p>The building instruction of the set does not use any new parts. But there are several in new respectively unusual colour:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.lego.com/service/bricks/5/1/6194079"" style=""width: 32px; height: 32px;"" />, <img alt="""" src=""https://www.lego.com/service/bricks/5/1/6167939"" style=""width: 32px; height: 32px;"" />, <img alt="""" src=""https://www.lego.com/service/bricks/5/1/6176298"" style=""width: 32px; height: 32px;"" /><br />
<img alt="""" src=""https://www.lego.com/service/bricks/5/2/4539880"" style=""height: 32px; width: 32px;"" /> The 5 x 7 open frame comes in black colour.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.lego.com/service/bricks/5/1/6172538"" style=""width: 32px; height: 32px;"" />There is a single piece in blue.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.lego.com/service/bricks/5/1/6089119"" style=""width: 32px; height: 32px;"" /> This 3L pin comes in red colour.</p>

<p>Odd choices:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.lego.com/service/bricks/5/2/4531751"" style=""width: 32px; height: 32px;"" /> All axle connectors are in brown which is, according to the parts list, a first for technic sets.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.lego.com/service/bricks/5/1/4211483"" style=""width: 32px; height: 32px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://www.lego.com/service/bricks/5/1/4143005"" style=""width: 32px; height: 32px;"" /> The 1/2 pin is used both in grey (front and rear light) and blue colour (warning lamps on top).</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://www.lego.com/service/bricks/5/1/6057526"" style=""width: 32px; height: 32px;"" /> This is the single piece in orange colour in this set and used to mount the steering wheel.</p>

<h3>Rating on the model</h3>

<p>I already mentioned a certain resemblance with set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8845-1"">8845.</a> The second that came to my mind is the jeep <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/8850-1"">8850</a>, one of the first sets to have the cylinder + motor blocks that are also used on this model. Both are of comparable size respectively dimension.</p>

<p>What I like on 42075:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The build process has been interesting as I haven&#39;t noticed a similar sequence in another of the recent technic models.</li>
	<li>Front hood and doors of driver cabinet can be opened.</li>
	<li>
	<p>Transmission from rear axle to motor is geared (2x 20:12 + 28:20 from differential) up so that pistons move quite fast.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>The suspension is firm.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>My criticism:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The front is open towards the front wheels, any bumper is missing.</li>
	<li>The diameter of turning cycle (measured at middle axis of the car) is 81 cm (32 &quot;). This is roughly 30% more than the turning cycle of the Container Truck <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42024-1/"">42024</a> (63 cm resp. 25 &quot;) and a bit more than for the Airport Rescue Vehicle <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42068-1/"">42068</a>!<br />
	I believe that this will reduce playability.<br />
	<em>Edit: </em>You can improve by about 5 cm / 2 &quot; if you use only blue pins in sub steps of 24 and omit the clear tiles in sub step 25.3. For my model, the wheels just don&#39;t touch the hinge of the cabin door.</li>
	<li>Technic figure which is roughly at the proper scale of this model cannot be seated (cf. 8850).</li>
</ul>

<p>Added front bumper, grille now black:</p>

<p>I had been looking at various Technic sets to build over the last few weeks, to take a break from the chaos of College, and I had noticed the simplicity revolving this set. It is a very sleek and sturdy vehicle ready for any challenge facing its way. It is a unique spin on the many general Fire Trucks Lego has produced over the years. Technic really took the time to make a comprehensive model that any builder can dive in to.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What I enjoyed about the set:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>While building the model, I enjoyed the very few amount of pieces needed to accomplish such a fun model to play with. Though I did give the model a 3/5 for its building process, the instructions did not deter the builder from wanting to play with the model fro hours after. It is very much tailored for the younger builder and does accomplish the idea of igniting the structural engineer within each child.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What I disliked about the set:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Though some may say the model is very bland in terms of its overall build experience, I must say that I do dislike the looks of it. The build allowed for the individual to make a moving engine, which many smaller sets do not have and a working steering. However, the set was not very visually stunning, like the Mack Anthem Truck. It took me a very long time to consider purchasing this set, simply due to its overall aesthetic. Lego did a great job at making the model highly functional, but failed to clean up the many gaps throughout this very small truck. Specifically the rear differential&nbsp;can be seen at any angle one looks at it, deterring from any one willing play with it any longer.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Would I recommend this set?</strong></h2>

<p>Through the few flaws I see in this set, I would recommend this set for any Technic or Fire Fighting fan. Though it may not exactly appeal to everyone&#39;s expectations of a First Responder, it does give insight into what the future may hold for this line of vehicle. The functionality is superb for this small of a model, but the looks do deter from anyone willing to buy this set out of necessity.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"j_d","2019-01-20T21:51:05.283Z","Great responder","<p>Features</p>

<p>The main build features moving pistons, rear wheel suspension, working winch, opening doors and hood, steering, 2 cones, popping up light, a fire extinguisher and an axe.</p>

<p>PROS</p>

<p>The &nbsp;build is very sturdy an makes a great toy or display.</p>

<h3>cons</h3>

<p>The lights on top tend to fall off and in my opinion the middle area of the back is too low,</p>
