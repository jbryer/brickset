<h3>Hovercraft</h3>

<p>Feature list:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Running on wheels</li>
	<li>Steering, also changes orientation of propulsion fans</li>
	<li>Propulsions fans driven from wheels</li>
	<li>Lowering + Raise of loading ramp</li>
	<li>Loading tool (&quot;crane&quot;) by means of a toothed rack (up/down)</li>
	<li>Bridge slides left/right for operation of the &quot;crane&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>The fans are rather wobbly turning left-right when the ship is pushed forward. Turning the steering knob will temporarily adjust their orientation.</p>

<h3>Truck</h3>

<p>The truck features steering, suspension and has a freight box that can be handled by any crane that connects with a technic (pin) hole.</p>

<p>On the inside, you&#39;ll find a colourful set of pieces including red, white, blue and, inevitably, also a single brown part. This is rather different from 42062 that shows clean use of colours.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>The overall length of the ship (ramp lowered) is similar, the width only 2/3 of the size of the box. Colour palette is nice.</p>

<p>Features and playability is comparable to last years <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42064-1"">Ocean Explorer</a>. You will need a flat surface to push the ship.<br />
The container truck from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42062-1"">42062</a> just fits onto the deck if you move the bridge to left or right.</p>

<p>It would have been nice if intakes for air cushion also had been connected to the wheels for rotation.</p>
