I thought the images made it look different to other types of little planes that LEGO has done before.&nbsp; I like to sample a little 2018 set every year, usually under the &pound;10 mark, and then I see if the building experience is any good and if the set has good play value.</p>

<p>I have to say that this is one of the best little jets I have built. Interesting techniques have been used to give this way more detail than I was expecting.&nbsp; Not bad part selection either, along with different uses of parts that I wouldn&#39;t have thought to use quite like the way they have been used.</p>

<p>It&#39;s great to fly around as well, sturdy and light I am really&nbsp;impressed. So much so it has given me ideas for designing more detailed jets of this size using similar techniques. I find some jets are clumsy and way too large to fit in the city, this addresses this well.</p>

<p>My only complaint would be way too many stickers for a little set, however, they are easy to apply and leaving them off does not detract from the jet at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well worth a buy in&nbsp;my opinion.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging:</strong></p>

<p>We get nice box art of this craft in flight and on the back a few more scenes with the craft. Again the colors really pop here. It is an attractive little package.</p>

<p>Inside we get 2 bags and a rather large sheet of stickers, which is a bummer in a way as the stickers cover large areas of this vehicle.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p>We get a nice little pilot figure here. He gets torso printing, front and back and a cool and confident head piece with blue aviator sunglasses.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build is rather simple but interesting. Given the rather low piece count I was wondering if the shots on the box were somewhat deceiving. But it was pretty nice to assemble this thing. The biggest draw back were the stickers, about 10 are included and I do think they are necessary. They are all big enough that there should not be problem applying them, but still too many.&nbsp;Here is a shot of your spare parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>When completed the silhouette of this is amazing. From above it looks like a hummingbird to me. From low angles it looks very sleek. From side angles it has a nice &nbsp;flowing shape only broken by the abrupt transition of the nose cone to the chassis. But still, I was quite pleased by the overall look and proportion of this jet. It feels like an oversized dart in hand and is shaped like it meant to be thrown too. Fun stuff.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>If you like jets and airshow craft, then this one should be an instant buy. The pilot sits nearly upright within which helps with display and despite the small build the details feel about right overall. Not a bad set for the price at all and certainly fun to display.&nbsp;</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-10-13T07:25:29.583Z","My 5 year old loves it, but it is easy to break","<p>So my son got this for his 5th birthday and it was the one set that he didn&#39;t open that day... but of all the small sets he did get, this one gets the most play.&nbsp; The reason why is simple, it&#39;s an airplane!</p>

<p>The build is a little complex for a 5 year old, but still very doable with some talking thru.&nbsp; He was more amazed by the SNOT parts than hindered by them.&nbsp; Of course there are a lot of stickers and that is of course my job to put on.&nbsp; I really don&#39;t think that sets for little kids should include stickers, even if it is a one time job, either kids are too young to realize you shouldn&#39;t put them on your shirt, or they old enough to realize that they need to ask for mommy or daddy&#39;s help so that it looks good.</p>

<p>The color scheme is very nice (at least for Americans), and the detail is great.&nbsp; It even has red and green lights for port and starboard which is of great educational value, however not quite yet.&nbsp; We first need to master left and right before we can get into port and starboard.</p>

<p>Of course my big complaint are the three wing bricks in the back fall off very easily.&nbsp; Not a big deal, my son can put them back on, and does without even thinking twice about it, but I do wish they were sturdier.</p>

<p>If you have a kid who doesn&#39;t have a Lego airplane yet, get them this set!</p>
