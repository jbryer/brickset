<p>The last one produced was Polybag 30348 issued a couple of years ago now and the vehicle included in this set is broadly similar in design to its immediate predecessor all be it with a return to the more common yellow bucket colour.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>The complete set retails in the UK at a penny under ten pounds, comes in a nice size standard City design blue box and contains two bags inside (unnumbered) plus a thirty two page instruction manual.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Eighty two pieces make up the set including the usual spare small parts.&nbsp; Highlights for me are the classic construction workers helmet in white with the matching ponytail version as well.&nbsp; Also included are two &#39;Gold Ore&#39; pieces and a glow in the dark white spider which are new pieces for 2018.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>A total of four minifigures are included, our dumper truck driver has an orange open front jacket with ID tag printed on the front, the mining company logo appears on the back plus the white version of the classic safety helmet.</p>

<p>He is joined by a lady explosives expert with orange printed harness on a dark blue background both front and back as well as on the legs.&nbsp; She wears the ponytail version of the classic white safety helmet.</p>

<p>Also included are two mining workers with white mining helmets that are fitted with a 1x1 round tile to represent their lamps.</p>

<p>The Supervisor is a stern looking fellow with printed braces and orange utility belt on a white button shirt plus pockets printed on his light brown trousers.&nbsp; His seemingly muscular colleague with the pecs inside a orange vest and braces is a very serious looking chap as well.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>Nothing complicated here, the first thing built is the dumper truck which is pretty much standard fare with yellow bucket and balloon tyred wheels,&nbsp;although the seat for the minifigure operator is lacking a little in comfort I feel.&nbsp; As per previous dumper trucks in City history, the front bucket tips forward to unload as required.</p>

<p>The next part of the build is a display cabinet for one of the gold ore pieces, very simple with a 3x2 cupboard topped with trans blue 1x2x2 wall elements and a 2x3 white tile on the top.</p>

<p>The third part of the build is something for our demolition&nbsp;girl (surely to be named Miss Dynamite?) to blow up!&nbsp; A 6x6 dark grey plate forms the base for a rock section made up of various parts including a small technic beam which when complete allows the dynamite piece to be pressed thus launching the lid off the rock and exposing another gold ore piece underneath (and presumably scaring the spider who the instructions seem to indicate should be hiding in that cupboard under the display case!)</p>

<p>To ensure Miss Dynamite plunges her detonator at the right moment, the Supervisor also gets a classic bullhorn in red in order to shout instructions from a distance!</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice little set providing good value for money with its four well detailed minifigures, a classic vehicles and playability with the exploding rock feature although I find the concept of the display cabinet located outside in a quarry slightly odd and out of place.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Even if you only buy this set for the vehicle, you still get four good minifigures&nbsp;and a very interesting selection of parts which will find use elsewhere.</p>
