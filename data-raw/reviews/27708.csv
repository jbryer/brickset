It packs plenty of bricks which allow the build of no less than 8 models at the same time in a neat package with a few parts to spare. My little one particularly enjoys the bird and the whale. Her second favourite are the airplane and the boat (she particularly enjoys spinning the propeller). The rabbit and the carrot are ok, but not memorable. The present and ice cream miss the mark and are disregarded by her (even though they are supposed to be the most girl-targeted models of the bunch). She has lots of fun throwing together some abstract creations by mixing and matching bricks from the set.</p>

<p>The parts selection is pretty good for creative play. As far as Duplo goes, the price of the set is very fair. There are no instructions per se with the set, but not really needed since the models are easy to reproduce out of the photos on the box (which looks neat).</p>

<p>While the package is great overall, I would wish that the main models were of more even play value. I also think that the bricks are a little too multi-colored which makes it hard for kids to make color-coordinated custom creations. Cutting down the number of colors would be better IMHO. Other than this, this set hits the marks.</p>
