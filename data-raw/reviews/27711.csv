And since it is a cake, cupcake, or ice cream you are building, your kids will be very motivated to build it and of course will love playing with it afterwards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With all the different special pieces included in this set, it really gives your kids a lot to get creative with, and of course you can always add onto it with other sets. Even my 4 year old son who is now more interested in &ldquo;little Legos&rdquo; still enjoys playing with this set.</p>

<p>Of course my kids discovered that the candles actually work as whistles so oftentimes they will simply take them out to blow them. Amazingly they respect that they are Duplos&nbsp;and always put them back.&nbsp;</p>
