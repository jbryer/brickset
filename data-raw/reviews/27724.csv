"Faefrost","2018-01-21T02:21:11.24Z","A slightly more modern modular. ","<p>Every year we get a new AFOL targeted Modular. And every year it impresses. This years offering is a little different as it gives us a slightly more &ldquo;moderne&rdquo; flair. It also marks a new design team tackling one of the buildings which gives us some new ideas and technics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building this year is an American style Diner, clearly from the mid to late 50&rsquo;s. &nbsp;The architecture and design is in the Streamline Moderne, Which is a departure from the more classical and Art Deco styles of prior buildings. It has very smooth facings, graceful curves and some really eye catching colors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Packaging - it&rsquo;s a Lego Modular building in the standard Creator Expert Modular building packaging. If you&rsquo;ve seen one you know what to expect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instructions - the instructions are a nice thick squarebound&nbsp;book. You are going to want to prop it open with something while building.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Layout - the set is the standard Modular Building layered &ldquo;wedding cake&rdquo; design. 3 floors and a roof, all stacked in a modular fashion. The first floor is the titular Diner. Jim&rsquo;s Diner to be exact. It&rsquo;s a very nice representation of a mid century&nbsp;classic America Diner. The smooth graceful curve of the awning around the front and side. The nicely curved front windows evoking thoughts of the classic Edward Hopper painting Nighthawks. The interior is well appointed with a fully tiled floor. A long smooth curving and intricately built lunch counter with three stools in front of the grill. A really nice brick built jukebox, and one and a half booths. Enough to get the point across. The next floor is accessed via stairs on the left side of the building with the entrance to the rear. It is a simple yet effective boxing gym. While it does the job, this section is in many ways the most lacking. Yeah it has a ring, heavily bag, some weights and a water cooler. Yet somehow it still feels bare. There&rsquo;s no real story going on there. Floor 3 is reached via a complex brick built wrought iron stairway. The top floor is a recording studio or possibly a radio station. There is a comfortable waiting area, a sound engineers control room and a sound proof recording studio. The walls are decorated with a gold record and an album. Up a ladder on the rear of the building reaches the roof. It has a working tilt up skylight, and the top dome of the tower with a small radio mast on top.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts - in a word amazing. This set resurrected&nbsp; a long retired color. Teal! And we don&rsquo;t simply get it in the curved pieces that go up the curving frontage. Most of the first floor walls are made from teal 1xX&rsquo;s. 1x2, 1x3 And 1x4. So a substantial amount.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build - a complex, intricate and educational build like all previous modulars. The brick built Diner sign is particularly nice as is the diner counter. And surprisingly the build on the included pink car is amazing. I should hate that car, much like I hate the Palace Cinema&rsquo;s Limo... but I don&rsquo;t it&rsquo;s too good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs&nbsp;- There are six serviceable minifigs. Noteworthy in that they have modern expressive faces for the first time. The Diner has presumably Jim, the cook and a roller skating waitress ( which seems odd? Those were a thing at drive ins. Not small storefront diners. Doubly odd in that the two guys that designed this are Americans, so it wasn&rsquo;t a weirdly translated cultural cue?) The Gym has a boxer with 70&rsquo;s style porn Star&nbsp;hair and a porno mustache, and a fairly standard woman in a hoodie workout clothes. The third floor has an office woman/producer and a 50&rsquo;s style musician. He clearly has an Elvis or Jerry Lee Lewis vibe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons- there are a few minor negative that don&rsquo;t really detract from the set as a whole, but are worth mentioning in the hopes the new designers can learn from this, just as they taught us so many cool new approaches with it the set is 99% great. These are the 1% room for improvement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- the tiled front looks great and is perfect for moderne streamline, but it feels missing something in terms of texture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Other than for the Diner, there is no signage for the other two businesses. Nothing to give a clue. Hence we. don&rsquo;t know if the top floor is a recording studio or radio station?&nbsp;</p>

<p>- there is no story flow or underlying story meandering though this one. There is nothing like the wedding proposal story running through Parisian Restaurant. There are 6 minifigs, one male and one female for each floor, but they are just there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- The Boxing Gym in particular feels a little light. It needed a touch more to it. Some story book. Maybe a cute Rocky call out. Something on the walls?&nbsp;</p>

<p>- There is no signage for anything other than the Diner. Nothing that indicates that the gym or studio are even there. Heck because of this we aren&rsquo;t sure if the third floor is a Recording Studio or a Radio station. It&rsquo;s admirable that there are no stickers. But there are limits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- I know this is real picky, but the minifigs&nbsp;not only don&rsquo;t tell a story. They are wildly in-cohesive in time. In previous modulars&nbsp;the minifigs&nbsp;tended to be rather generic. Blending together and appropriate for a wide range of settings. While the use of more expressive and almost CMF style figures is nice and an improvement in some regards, these 6 figures don&rsquo;t flow well. Jim is nicely generic. The Waitress is straight out of the late 50&rsquo;s early 60&rsquo;s. The Boxer is pure 1977 with that hair and mustache. The Gym Girl is wearing an outfit that would not appear till the 80&rsquo;s or 90&rsquo;s. The singer is straight up late 50&rsquo;s. Yeah it&rsquo;s a picky detail. Weirdly Gym Girls sleeveless&nbsp;hoody is probably the most visually distracting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- finally last nitpick. And it&rsquo;s a trivial one. This is a straight building that feels like it should have been a Corner. Which is a great follow up to the Brick Bank. A corner building that should have been a straight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t take any of this to indicate a problem with this set. It is a superb modular. In terms of recent or current Modulars&nbsp;I would rank it above the Palace Cinema and Brick Bank, and not quite as good as the Parisian Restaurant. (Due to scale the Assembly Square is it&rsquo;s own thing.) About on par with the Detective Office. It&rsquo;s an enjoyable and rewarding build with lots of new creative parts use. It should not be missed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final thoughts and Caveats. This is a fantastic set for an AFOL. Emphasis on Adult. 16+. Some of the builds are tricky, fragile and frustrating until you get things locked down. The first floor awning in particular. Kids will need adult help there. Also like all the Modulars&nbsp;it&rsquo;s not really a play set. It looks nice but will not stand up to rough play. Also some fans have been grumbling that the more modern style doesn&rsquo;t not well match the prior buildings. Honestly I don&rsquo;t think that is the case. It goes alongside most extremely well. Most towns are a mixed bag of styles. The only pairing I would avoid would be to put it up against the Parisian Restaurant. Put some space between those two to avoid a color and style clash.&nbsp;</p>

<p>P.S. This set just screams to have those new printed fried egg tiles stolen from the new Batman Movie Egghead Mech set. I mean Bacon and Pancakes are fine... but it really wants bacon and eggs. Also anybody that doesn&rsquo;t immediately stick Batman and Superman in the Diner booth having coffee as part of their permanent display has no soul.&nbsp;</p>

"Pmontill","2018-04-06T02:55:52.33Z","First Expert Level Set","<p>It&rsquo;s a really impressive set. The level of detail is beyond anything I experienced with a Lego set. It is definitely not for a beginner Lego fan, and depending on the amount of time to build can take a couple of days to build it fully. It definitely feels like you get your money worth it with this set. Congrats to the team that thought up and&nbsp;created the diner!</p>

"Brickchap","2018-04-11T11:02:03.553Z"," Downtown Diner Letdown","<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The Downtown Diner is a great model let down by poor decisions in architectural style and colour and there are various flaws throughout. However, a 1950&#39;s diner has been long awaited by many Lego fans including myself and I am happy with the model overall. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Box:</span></span></u></b></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The box is about the average Modular box size and shows the usual features and the model alongside the other modulars. Immediately there is a suggestion of the lack of versatility in this set, as seen in its position next to Assembly Square, in which both models look ridiculous. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Parts:</span></span></u></b><b> </b></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">An important thing to mention is the reintroduction of the colour teal, which is used in the main &lsquo;jukebox tower&rsquo; and along the walls for the first floor. This is a welcome part return for AFOLs and a good choice of colour which suits the Retro era. There are three foliage pieces; one green leaf piece and two flower pieces, used in both yellow and orange. There are also various recolours of pieces, especially in pink and the previously mentioned teal, most notably the 1x3 jumper plate used in the car. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Build:</span></span></u></b><b> </b></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The build, like most other modular is straightforward, although the experience and difficulty will differ with different builders. The construction of the DINER sign is probably the most difficult part of the model to assemble.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Some techniques to note are the placing of tiles sideways to create a brickwork effect. This is very well done and allows for the awnings of the windows to stick out a tad. The designers have also favoured non-attached windows. The black windows of the second and third floors, as well as the round windows on the side of the jukebox tower are all wedged in between the other pieces, which is a good idea. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Minifigs</span></span></u></b></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">There are 6 minifigs in this set which is a reasonable amount for a modular building.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Unlike previous modulars, the minifigs this time use &lsquo;modern&rsquo; faces. This is a welcome and long overdue addition, allowing for further character and story development. However, this change will be somewhat negative during this transition period, but will no longer be a problem once more modulars using the modern faces have been released. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">First is Jim the cook/diner owner. He reuses the face of one of the fisherman from Old Fishing Store, so perhaps he likes to fish when not cooking. His hat and torso have appeared before, although his unshaven face and the stomach line on the torso work to together to create the interesting character of the slightly untidy and overweight, but friendly diner cook seen in many American movies.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Next is the diner waitress who is more reminiscent of a 1960s drive thru diner then 1950&#39;s. She features the CMF Diner waitress&rsquo;s hair in the new color of black and a torso first introduced in Fun at the Beach. Although the CMF waitress would fit the setting a lot better, this waitress is fine and the roller skates are a good touch. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Next is the boxer. He would be more appropriate in the 1970s which really detracts from the set. His face print is again a 1970s style. It seems as if the designers just got all the prints from the City People Packs and chose parts at random. The brown hair and orange moustache don&rsquo;t go well together at all. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">There is a gym girl, whose parts also appear to have been taken straight from the City People Packs. The tracksuit is very inaccurate for the era. However, the sweating face is a good inclusion. She is one of 3 minifigs with a double sided face. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Then there is the recording studio manager. She also has no new parts, although she is a perfectly fine inclusion. Her annoyed and pleased faces are great inclusions.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Finally is the star of the set; Elvis Presley. Officially he is just called a musician, which is an understatement for The King. The reuse of the torso from the Lego Batman Movie looks excellent, as does the &lsquo;Elvis&rsquo; hair in dark brown. The face is the best part. He has a very confident smile on one side and a &lsquo;Uh Huh&rsquo; singing face on the other. Perhaps he will be recording &lsquo;All Built Up&rsquo;. His red guitar is a great inclusion, although the lack of printing is very disappointing. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The Completed Model</span></span></u></b></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">As with Palace Cinema, this set includes an old car. Any old car is instantly a welcome inclusion by me. This one is a 1950&#39;s Cadillac or Chevrolet. Unlike Palace Cinema&rsquo;s 1941 Buick, this time the designers chose a reasonable wheel size. The front uses simple pieces but looks great, as does the rear with the huge fins and tail lights. The car is also able to fit 3 minifigs thanks to the use of jumper plates and the combination of the 1x2 cheese slopes in tan and 1x3 jumpers in pink allow for great seat details. There is also additional room for the guitar. Unlike the Diner, which will be covered next, the car&rsquo;s pink colouring is fine, due to Elvis owning a pink car. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Finally the building itself. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">This is the main part of the set and where all the problems lie. </span></span></p>

<p><strong><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Exterior:</span></span></strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The things that stand out most are the modern streamline awning of the diner, the DINER sign and the &lsquo;jukebox tower&rsquo;. All of which feature the first problem, teal and pink colours.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The inclusion of teal in the set, as previously stated, does fit the Retro era. The pink however does not. Pink and teal are a very odd colour choice, most diner&rsquo;s being red and white or sometimes silver. These colours are made worse by the DINER sign which is a different shade of pink found no where else in the set. Then the harsh contrast with the tan and grey of the &lsquo;regular&rsquo; building makes the whole building look even worse.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">I have modified my own diner to be red and teal instead of pink, which looks A LOT better. Why the designers chose pink over red, or even made lots of new pieces in teal when red, white and grey would have been a lot cheaper and looked better, I do not know. Some fans have described Downtown Diner as looking like a Friends set, which is a good description. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Unlike the colour problem, which can be fixed relatively easily, there is the huge problem of the jukebox tower. Here both the architecture and colours combine to create an&nbsp; eyesore that ruins the model and hugely detracts from all the good points about this set. . Regardless of whether a streamline moderne tower exists in real life or not, the tower looks like it was a separate MOC that was stuck onto the side of the tan section for no reason. The fully glassed front and rounded sides clash with the tan section., Although the idea of a jukebox is relevant to the era, no one builds a building to look like a jukebox, especially on the side of another building. If the whole building were done in this style it would not matter that much. </span></span><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">A streamline moderne diner with an older building above is completely fine and realistic, but the tower is not. Then the bright and lary colours of the teal and pink and white make it look out of place and stupid. Not only does this look terrible with its tan partner, but prevents the entire model from going next to a traditional modular. The only positive I can say about the tower monstrosity is the radio antenna on top. &nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The actual diner section however, looks awesome. The curved window at the front is great and the awning is done perfectly with the two inner stripes of colour being set back a tad. The glass around the door is fine and the red Jim&rsquo;s sign on the door is great too. (thankfully this was done in red and not pink). The parking meter is a great idea as well.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Unlike previous modulars, the Downtown Diner can be used as either a corner building or placed alongside another building. This is done by having the side where the stairs are left open and having the awning sweep around to the back , which is done perfectly, I cannot praise the designers enough for their excellent work with the awning. I think this set looks best as a corner unit, but looks okay as a straight building. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The 1st floor rear is fine although the gray pieces from the stove are extremely obvious, perhaps some greenery could have been added to try and cover it up a bit. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The 2<sup>nd</sup> floor tan section looks great. The drain pipe and air conditioner unit are two great details and I previously mentioned the brilliant use of the tiles placed sideways and outset awnings. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The back of the 2<sup>nd</sup> floor features probably the best build of the set, the spiral staircase. It uses 1x4 fence pieces placed upwards and bars and robot arms to create a perfect staircase that looks great, is interesting to build and not too difficult to construct either. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The third floor includes a balcony,although sadly it is too crammed, as is the case with many modulars. I would have preferred if the building had just been left straight with no balcony. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The roof is the least interesting, although the technique for the architecture is really well done. The use of handle bar pieces as a rounded ladder was a great use of parts. </span></span></p>

<p><strong>Interior:</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The interior is the best part of this set. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The diner interior is absolutely awesome, and the reason most of us will buy this set. The majority of the diner is taken up by the counter, which is a nice SNOT build and even includes a foot rail. The build-in drink dispenser is really good. The coffee machine is fine, but I love the coffee pot build. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The stove however is probably the weakest part. It reminds me of a stove that would be included in a regular Creator set, rather then a Creator Expert one. The use of the tipper beds for the range hood is great, but the stove is the same dials over and over with every 2<sup>nd</sup> stud being exposed. The use of just dark red grille pieces as opposed to the &lsquo;bacon&rsquo; print from Jack Sparrow Brickhead is a disappointment, as was the use of just plain tan round tiles, when they could have included either the printed waffle piece from The Lego Movie, or the broken egg pieces from The Lego Batman Movie. The lack of burgers or fries is also a bit of a concern for a 50s American diner. I appreciate the lack of space, although in summary the kitchen does seem of a lesser quality then usual. Thankfully the quality gets much better. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">First is my favourite thing, the jukebox, a must-have in any diner. There are definitely better jukebox designs out there, although the use of the &lsquo;macaroni&rsquo; pieces is good. It does look very much like a Creator build, not that&rsquo;s a bad thing.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The most awesome build is the booth. All diners feature booths and this one is done splendidly, with everything from the rounded seats and the consistent colours between the table and the counter, right down to the napkin dispenser, which is absolutely awesome. It is instantly recognisable and really well done. Sadly there is only one booth, and the single seat facing the door is extremely odd. Some seating along the window would have been good, although I understand that is not possible. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The walls are decorated with the star print from Palace Cinema. Here was a missed opportunity The designers did not even bother to recolour the print from dark tan, which looks disgusting next to the other colours and makes the diner look like a MOC, rather then a proper, official set. I would have loved to have seen some more printed records of Rock n Roll </span></span><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">(this print is included in the 3rd floor).</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The next floor is a gym. Here again there can be a bit of controversy. I personally will stick to the opinion that the gym was only included to show the &lsquo;healthy balance&rsquo; of diner food and exercise necessary in today&rsquo;s world. However, gyms did exist in the 1950&#39;s and this one is both historically accurate and the builds are decent. The boxing ring takes up a lot of space and is not that interesting, although the designers did a great job with it. The punching bag is on a ball joint, providing a fun play feature. The bench press is good too, although the disc pieces are probably out of scale, I doubt even the fittest minifig could lift them. The dumbbell rack, water cooler and clock are all good inclusions. Although I personally would have preferred a dance hall, record store or apartment, the builds are good, no complaints there and I will finally have a place to put the CMF Boxer and Kick Boxer. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The third floor is a recording studio, which is a great idea. It is spacious and welcoming, I am very pleased with the gold record on the wall, although the Rock N Roll tile print is the best. The minifig musician on the front of the record case is definitely a Lego version of a young Elvis. The main parts of the studio, the recording booth and control area are the best. The huge old fashioned recording equipment looks awesome and the fact that it is removable is great. The mixing board is a very simple but effective build. The booth features a 1950&#39;s era microphone which also looks awesome and the use of the Technic rail pieces as soundboards are perfect and show a good attention to detail, although the whole booth should have been sound proofed. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Overall</span></span></u></b></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The main part of the set which gives it its name, is awesome. There are some minor flaws here and there but overall I am very happy with the diner section. The gym is absolutely fine and has some nice builds. The record studio is great, maybe a little more furniture could have been added, but again no complaints. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The car is awesome, its old, it seats a decent amount of minifigures and it captures the look of the era. The wheels are not the most accurate, but this is nit-picking.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">The minifigs are mostly great, Jim and Elvis probably standing out the most, although others, like the gym lady for example, do not seem to have the same amount of effort put into creating their character.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">But the exterior really lets this one down. The overly bright and poorly chosen colours, along with the mishmash of architectural styles in the same building detract from the goodness inside and prevent the model from &lsquo;fitting in&rsquo; with the other modulars. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">Something I did not previously mention is the era itself. The other modulars are roughly 1890-1940 in architectural style and while some try to be old buildings in a present day setting, the vehicles and technology usually suggest a period of 1930&#39;s-1940&#39;s. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">1950&#39;s America is a very different style to the other modular and clashes naturally. The diner on its own with the streamline modern architecture and the tan building would have been fine, especially had they been done in more realistic colours, but the jukebox tower gives the model a lack of versatility. I commend the designers on keeping pretty close to the time period, unlike some other modulars which randomly combine different eras. However, this model has, especially by the tower, been over-retroized, so that it becomes &lsquo;too modern&rsquo; for the other modulars and too old for a present day city. This sudden shift from traditional to &lsquo;out-there&rsquo; retro may suggest that future modulars will continue to become more modern, a change I will be very disappointed and annoyed about. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">This was the 2<sup>nd</sup> modular ever that was not a &lsquo;day 1&rsquo; purchase (the other being Palace Cinema). Hopefully the 2019 modular will be a 50s garage or car dealership which will allow a better transition between the different time periods. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:12.0pt""><span style=""line-height:107%"">For people wanting a diner in their city, I recommend this set, especially if your not too picky about historical accuracy or consistency. For people who are getting their first modular or continuing their collection I would highly recommend getting a more traditional modular such as Parisian Restaurant or Detectives Office before considering this. </span></span></p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-10-28T22:48:51.1Z","An American odd duck","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The Diner to me is&nbsp;somewhat of an odd duck in the Lego Modular line-up for two reasons: it is clearly based on American architecture and it is placed in the 1950&#39;s/1960&#39;s. As with <strong>set 10246 Detective&#39;s Office</strong> the exterior is IMHO not its&nbsp;most attractive feature, but this is made up for with the interiors and the building techniques used. The latter is the clear strength of the set. To me, this modular is somewhat of a&nbsp;&#39;love &#39;em or hate &#39;em&#39; type of set. It also &#39;suffers&#39; somewhat from being a successor to the <strong>Assembly Square (set 10255)</strong>.&nbsp;Looking at PPP, the price is good, but of course there are many small pieces.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>As with all modulars, the age range given is 16+. This is for me the first modular I have seen where I can see some of the techniques used posing a challenge to much younger builders; that said, with some patience, younger builders should be able to complete this set.&nbsp;To me, this set provided the most enjoyable building experience of the five&nbsp;modulars&nbsp;I have built so far.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the very start it is obvious that the designer likes curved&nbsp;studless builds, and also uses a lot of SNOT and sideways building techniques. Highlights for me&nbsp; were the bar on the ground floor, the roof with the &#39;Diner&#39; sign, the stairs between the first and second floor, the construction of the roof decoration. Some of the micro builds are also nice. This might also be one of the first sets where the &#39;clamp-sides-of-bricks-under-arches&#39; technique has been used, a technique which has been used to very great effect in the magnificent&nbsp;<strong>Hogwarts Castle (set 71043)</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build of the car is nice, with no truly special techniques used. The most uncommon sequence was the construction of the rounded edges carrying the head lights at the front.</p>

<p>The building sequence is similar&nbsp;to that of other regular modulars: two bags for the ground floor, one for each floor and a final bag for the roof and car.&nbsp;The instructions are generally clear to follow, though once every while one has to pay attention.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The designer has also done a great job at not making the build repetitive, and providing attachment points for the cook and waitress&nbsp;on the ground floor. The great number of unusual building techniques more than makes up for it, IMHO. Also, off-colour parts are generally well covered (and not visible). About the only elements I would have liked to see in another colour would be the brown 1x1-2-high-studs-on-the-side bricks used; that said, the only alternative I know of are bright red (which would have been downright ugly). The teal and bright pink parts wil probably be quite popular pieces for MOCs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The design as a whole shows the great understanding of Lego geometry by the designer. The various sections and construction elements in the end line up very well, and make for a remarkably solid structure, something especially clear during construction of the ground floor.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are 6 minifigures included in this set, all of them excellent, IMHO, and all of them unique.</p>

<p>The first minifigure&nbsp;built is the cook, which - due to him wearing a kitchen cap - logically has no alternate face print. That is IMHO more than made up for by the face print he does have; the magnificent sideburns, and the subtle use of grey&nbsp;to give them character. The print of his chef&#39;s coat is good as well.</p>

<p>Accompanying him on the ground floor is the waitress on roller skates. She has a beautiful smile and a lovely hair piece. The torso print is of a simple striped shirt. She carries a great ice-cream coupe to an imaginary&nbsp;customer.</p>

<p>On the first floor, the most noticeable minifigure&nbsp;is the boxer. At its core, it is a good minifigure, but I think it could easily have been much better. He only has one face print, whereas a second one showing him after a work out, or perhaps after a boxing match, would have been a very nice addition. Second, he has a good front torso print (showing off his chest muscles and abs) but no print for the back, which is a shame, IMHO. I do like his boxing gloves are moulded on, and his shorts/legs is a dual-mould.</p>

<p>Also trying out the gym is a nice female figure in sweatshirt and sweatpants. I also like her hair piece.The torso print is nice. This lady has an alternate face print: one depicting her at the limits of her endurance/strength, while the other might suggest she is flirting with the boxer (or he with her, to her dislike).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Manning the top floor is a nice lady, who could be a singer, or - more likely given her facial expressions - a sound technician or the manager of the musician. I like her facial expressions. The torso is nicely detailed.</p>

<p>The musician is the final minifigure. He has two nice face prints, one showing him smiling, while the other shows him&nbsp;singing. He wears a nice jacket, with only a print on the front of the torso. His hair piece seems Elvis inspired.</p>

<h2>The build(s)</h2>

<p>The car is a nice addition to this build. It has a nice 1960&#39;s vibe to it, while also sharing some similarities (it seems) with the likes of the police car in the <strong>Batman Arkham Asylum</strong> set <strong>(set 70912)</strong> and the Anglia in Harry Potter&#39;s <strong>Whomping Willow</strong> set <strong>(set 75953)</strong>. Generally, I like it.</p>

<p>Overall, to me the building feels like an older building&nbsp;which at a later date has been (partially) remodeled to accommodate a diner.. Perhaps a somewhat daring choice, but one that keeps the exterior more visually interesting, and makes a three-level structure at least somewhat believable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The diner on the ground floor has a very nice interior, with&nbsp;a good&nbsp;mixture of stools and benches. I like the gum ball machine&nbsp;and the open kitchen. The designer has done an excellent job with the curves, which in the end all look natural.</p>

<p>The star element of the first floor is clearly the curved stairway to the second floor. When in place it is remarkably solid. In general it looks good enough that it would not have looked completely out of place on the front of the building. I also like the airco, hanging out of the window. The structure hanging the training bag for boxing is integrated in such a way as to not be an eyesore; again, well done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second floor houses a nice recording studio, which is also very nicely done, both the recording studio itself, as well as the equipment used. The wall decorations are a nice touch. The roof itself is IMHO again a highlight. All elements look &#39;natural&#39;.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>As with all the other Modulars, this is clearly a display set, although - floor by floor - there is room for play.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Having built this set, I am definitely more positive about it than I expected to be. The construction offered&nbsp;some 6 hours of building fun. Overall, IMHO it also looks better than expected in real life.&nbsp; Yes, it is a bit of an odd duck in the Modular line-up, but in its quality of design and the quality of the details, it clearly belongs. The RRP also seems quite reasonable. But I can also see why quite a few people do not like it; just as with Detective&#39;s Office, its North American architecture in general, and its outspoken 1950&#39;s/1960&#39;s look might put off even more people. That said, I think its inclusion is a good thing, for it adds some variety to the Modular range in general.</p>

"legomandre42082","2018-09-20T18:15:15.5Z","Strikingly detailed 50s era Diner!","<h2><strong>Nostalgia brought forth in Lego!</strong></h2>

<p>I had taken a two-year hiatus from collecting Lego after getting started in College, last year. I was in my dorm one day when I saw a promotion for the Sixty years of Brick and noticed that this beauty of a set was available. I immediately jumped on to Lego shop at home and purchased this gorgeous set. This one set single handedly reignited my interest in Lego again. Every detail in the set made me so happy while&nbsp; built during the Super Bowl with my family last Winter. My inner-child was so boastful as I put every piece in its rightful place.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What I enjoyed about the set:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>As with the Detective&#39;s Office, I was astonished at the level of precision the designers took to make the model so detailed and accurate. While watching shows such as Riverdale, I am amazed at how similar the diner in the shows looks to the actual model. Even down to the curved walls and windows, this set exudes nostalgia that many sets do not appear to have. The spiral staircase between the second and third floors was easily my favorite part of the entire building process. The various difficulty in steps for the set shows how much the Lego Creator Expert line knows that the audience wants to use these techniques for their own MOCs.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The minifigures also were a strategic part in why I bought this set. This was the first Modular building, at least from my knowledge, that utilized unique molds for the various characters in the set. This aspect made it more fun to play and set up scenes with more action and emotion than in previous models. By utilizing new methods in designing the characters, it mde the consumer more likely to set-up the proper scenes that were portrayed on each level and not acquire figures from other sets. I was so happy to place these characters in and around the building and felt confident in their place, even in the beautiful Cadillac parked out front.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What I disliked about the set:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>The&nbsp;only aspect of the set I did not enjoy was the gym on the second floor. I do understand that it was common&nbsp;during these times to have a workout studio near a recording studio, but it deters from the atmosphere in this era. It would have been more appropriate to have the second floor be a conference room&nbsp;for various recording artists of the studio manager, while having the third floor be the larger recording studio and office of the manager, to display his prominence in the city. The gym did not really flow with the overall ideology of the set.&nbsp;</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Would I recommend this set?</strong></h2>

<p>Given the level of detail and intricacy prevalent in this model, I would highly recommend this model to any avid Modular collector or individual that grew up during this era. It was a very fun and easy building to construct. The designers did an excellent job to incorporate the smallest details and make the build enjoyable for all ages.&nbsp;</p>

"Alltimefol","2019-01-10T12:14:25.8Z","Imho the best modular building","<p>Part 1: the build</p>

<p>I found the construction of this build mostly very enjoyable, with many snot (studs not on top)&nbsp;techniques, and a very cool assisting model of a car that had many interesting techniques.</p>

<p>Part 2: the parts</p>

<p>The parts for this set are very good, bringing back rock raiders teal and having NO STICKERS and only printed pieces.&nbsp;Remember that lego, we do not like stickers.</p>

<p>Part 3: the playability&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a set not really designed for playability specifically, but it does have a bit with the floors opening up and the car. Personally i think the playability of any lego&nbsp;Set is building and rebuilding it.</p>

<p>Part 4: the minifigures</p>

<p>The diner, like most modular buildings, has fairly generic minifigures but it does have the boxing gloves and an extra pair of those could come in handy.</p>

<p>part 4: value for money</p>

<p>The set offers a reasonable ppp (price per piece) at 6.9 or about 7 cents a piece and comes with some rare ones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, if you are a fan of the modular buildings I would recommend getting this</p>

"indykid","2020-06-18T01:38:23.783Z","Always wanted a LEGO Diner, now I have one!","<p>I saw this on the LEGO site shortly after buying the 10232 Palace Cinema to build during quarantine and I couldn&#39;t resist! Along with a movie theater, a 50s diner is one set I&#39;ve always wanted along with a recording studio and when I saw that was one of the floors I was even more stoked.</p>

<p>The sidewalk has some great detail. I like the updated flowers as well as the parking meter (guess this is the only spot on the modulars where they have to pay for parking?&quot;) and mailbox (though it could&#39;ve used some mail like the 10211 Grand Emporium). The lamp at the top of the stairs is really nice but is really easy to bump into when moving the top floors around. The interior of the diner has somethings I always wanted--the red booth! the jukebox! the soda fountain! the stools!--and some welcome surprises. I especially like the gumball machine (which took some skill to arrange the gumballs in a way that was aesthetically pleasing) and the napkin dispenser on the table. The grill hood is great and was very cleverly designed. I was really not sure how any of the round windows, signage, facade etc was going to be build and it was quite fun to watch it come together so beautifully as I built it. The exterior staircase on the first floor is a smart choice even if it looks a little strange up against the flat blank wall of another Modular set. The back alley has some nice detail with the trash can and crate with two round 1x1 tiles inside though I feel like it could&#39;ve used maybe one more detail or fixture.</p>

<p>The second floor is also fun to watch come together. Building the wrestling ring, water cooler, and punching bag in particular was quite enjoyable. The gym feels like it&#39;s missing just one more thing as it&#39;s not quite as fun to be in compared to the diner and music studio but that may just be my bias as I do not have a gym membership. The brick exterior laid out with tiles was a fun part of the build and the side windows overlooking the stairwell were very neatly designed so as to not require any studs snapping in. And the box fan A/C and drainpipe are a great touch. Building the back staircase up to the top floor was another ingenious design and quite a fun mini build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The top floor is packed with detail. The actual studio is super cool, with the retro microphone and some really crazy round windows that use&nbsp;another intriguing&nbsp;SNOT technique not to mention the visually&nbsp;spot on soundproofing. The sound booth area is great and has some very great printed tiles for all the knobs and controls on the tape machine and sound board. The little bar and the armchair are both great, though the armchair tends to pull apart from its stand easily. The patio is nice and has a door so similar to the other windows on the front of the building that I didn&#39;t notice it was a door until I was actually building it. The studio weirdly as a completely clear door onto the back porch unlike the solid blue door to the gym and it opens from the opposite side causing it to snag on the railing a little but since its in back of the building it&#39;s easy to overlook.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The roof is neat and though I&#39;m not entirely sure why it needed access it&#39;s still welcome nonetheless. The skylight is cool and I like the little pole that props it open. There&#39;s a very flimsy pole sticking out of the roof that looks like it connects to something in the studio implying radio broadcast capabilities. The pink cadillac is great and spacious, comfortably fitting 3 minifigs. My only reservation is that the side view mirrors don&#39;t look as good as the ones on the Buick from Palace Cinema. There&#39;s 6(!) minifigs all with detailed faces as opposed to the older smiley faces on previous Modular sets; a controversial decision and I&#39;m partial to the universal smiley faces but not enough to swap them out. The new faces feel right for these characters. The boxer and bodybuilder are a little anachronistic which is only slightly bothersome and there&#39;s not a whole lot you can do with the boxer outside the gym since he&#39;s got boxing gloves but not a major flaw.</p>

<p>All of the glass features on the right side with the teal bricks and even down to the first floor surround the diner entrance look fantastic and the rare teal and pink color scheme was a delight to sift through when hunting for pieces. Because I hadn&#39;t built any LEGO sets from the last few years I was delighted by the yellow outline indicating where pieces go in each new step and am glad that LEGO rolled this feature out for clarity&#39;s sake. Overall, I&#39;m so glad I got this set right before it went out of stock for who knows how long on the LEGO website. I know the architectural style doesn&#39;t quite match up with previous Modular sets which may bother some but a lot of cities have disparate architectural styles right next to each other so it&#39;s not entirely unrealistic. Plus I&#39;m still just happy that I now have a 50s diner LEGO!</p>

While some dislike the choice to include non-simple facial expressions on the figures, I personally think it was an excellent choice. The Cadillac looks excellent and has an amazing colour&nbsp;scheme. The exterior is amazing, but the interior is where it really shines. The kitchen is fabulous, and the seats are amazing. The gym upstairs is brilliant, especially the boxing ring. The recording studio is astonishing and everything in there is spectacular. The amount of detail included in every inch is terrific. My only gripe is how fiddly the roof is to put together. Overall a brilliant set that has a brilliant amount of detail!</p>
