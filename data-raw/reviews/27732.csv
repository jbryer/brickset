And second, when I saw this model announced, it was the thing that really got me interested in the Speed Champions line of cars. And the value of these sets are great in my opinion.</p>

<p>Your first experience with this is the great artwork on the box showcasing the model and the source material. The box itself is well filled with a mix of parts although largely green as expected.</p>

<p>The build itself is straightforward but never boring. You find yourself continually intrigued as to how it&#39;s coming together. The techniques used created some great details, and I especially liked the way the rear lights and bumper were done.</p>

<p>And so to the finished car. She&rsquo;s a beauty! Like I said at the beginning of this review, I loved it in the original promotional shots. And all I can say is that it lived up to my expectations!</p>

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably already guessed that my recommendation is that this is a must have set for any car and LEGO lover. It&rsquo;s been done such a great service by the LEGO Designers and would be appreciated by anyone.</p>

<p>The car design is nearly accurate from the real model, but the time counter does not do anything at all.</p>

<p>but is worth to buy.</p>

This is my first foray into the world of Speed Champions, and I was definitely not disappointed. As an avid fan of the venerable Ford Mustang, this was an easy purchase. I have a particular fondness for the 1968-69 era Mustangs. This car was featured in the film &quot;Bullitt&quot; with Steve McQueen, and is a classic. I think this Lego version does the original great justice, and I was very happy with the end result. The fastback, the fender flare, the front grill. Everything to me was as good as it could be at this scale. I hope Lego releases more Ford vehicles from this time period, as well as other muscle cars from this era. All in all I would highly recommend this set if you are a Mustang fan, a Ford fan, or just like muscle cars in general!</p>

"Wendigo1","2019-11-03T21:33:46.443Z","Oh Eleanor ","<p>Hello Everyone, here&#39;s my second review. The 1968 Mustang Fastback jumped out to me when I first saw it, memories of Gone in 60 Seconds and Bullitt&nbsp;came to mind. After building it, I was not disappointed.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigure and Scenery Build: Fairly Standard Speed Champions. The racing style driver and lap clock sponsored by Ford. Functional, but I&#39;ll just part them out to other places in my city.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build itself was a brisk and easy one. I appreciated the front and rear builds to make the easily recognizable Mustang profile. The triple stacked trans red studs as the taillights was a great touch. This was exactly what I thought it would be. While some care about the 6 vs 8 stud width, I think the current set up is the best to stay in the lanes of the existing road plates.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest drawback is the standard complaint about Speed Champions: the stickers. I found that half were unnecessary. I only used the racing stripe running on the top&nbsp;from front to back and the Mustang logo on the front grill. I left off the stickers on the sides as they just distracted from the great lines of the set. I had forest green and white tiles in my own collection&nbsp;to keep the wire stripe on the sides without the cluttered look of the stickers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Overall, I can&#39;t more strongly recommend this set. It&#39;s exactly as I envisioned.&nbsp;</p>

"Brentski","2018-12-13T23:33:55.21Z","Love cars","<p>The speed champion sets caught my eye recently. I don&#39;t follow racing in particular, but these sets are fun build. I consider the single and double Speed Champion sets to be some of the better values in the entire Lego line.</p>

<p>The pieces I would call fairly standard for car builds. I particular like the dusky colored wind shield. The one minifig is a good match, though not outstanding.</p>

<p>The set itself is about an hour long to build, perfect for an after work break.</p>

<p>The set works well for either&nbsp;display or play.</p>

"MartinT","2019-10-16T17:44:56.483Z","This is one of the best Speed Champions car","<p>I choose the 1968 Ford Mustang Fastback because of nostalgia and the attention to all the amazing details. I also liked that the car doesn&rsquo;t need stickers to make up the details of the front and rear, like some other speed champions car.</p>

<p>It is interesting that Lego release a 1968 Ford Mustang Fastback, in the year 2018, 50 years after the movie Bullitt.</p>

<p>The minifigure that is included is nice and authentic. Because of a tan racing overall and black gloves&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Color</b></p>

<p>The graphic details on this car suggest that this Ford Mustang Fastback is a special racing edition. The side build also confirm this. Because it shows a fast time on the &frac14; mile track.</p>

<p>The color choose for this car is nice. The green color of the car is very close to the real color, Highland green. The black hood and roof should also be in the same green color. Its ok, because it reminds me of old car with vinyl roof. So, the black on this Mustang is nice. Now we have a Ford Mustang Fastback with a vinyl roof.</p>

<p>The interior color is the same tan color as the minifigure. This looks weird. Maybe black is a better choose for the interior color.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Building</b></p>

<p>This car as a lot of interesting and unique building technics. The front, rear and sides are built with many small pieces that fits perfectly together. It is amazing how it looks when you have built the car.</p>

<p><span style=""tab-stops:61.2pt"">After you build the car, you will find an empty space behind the driver. This is weird. </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Stickers</b></p>

<p>I was not sure what to do with the stickers. The car will look great without the stickers, but the gold wheel color will then look weird. If they had included gray wheels, you will have the option to make a stock Ford Mustang Fastback.</p>

<p>The gold wheels also match the stickers with the gold racing stripe. This is the reason why I apply those stickers.</p>

<p>But the stickers on the top side feels unnecessary and makes the car sticker heavy. Therefore, I did not apply them. This also makes the car more beautiful, because the lines of the car are more visible.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>What I mean by the best Speed champions car is a car that looks amazing from all angles, looks like the real car (not like a toy car), has no studs (this car is one of few without a single stud showing) and don&rsquo;t need a lot of stickers.</p>
