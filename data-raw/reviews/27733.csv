"GJBricks","2018-04-14T12:13:12.533Z","The Speed Champions Fiesta is a mean, blue, rallying machine! ","<p>As usual with the LEGO Speed Champions sets, the whole package from the packaging, to the build to the finished product reflects how far the quality of LEGO Sets has come!</p>

<p>Inside the box, it&rsquo;s pleasingly full. The parts selection in the bags is largely the Ford blue, white and black but with some standout bits of yellow and red.&nbsp;The sticker sheet is extremely well printed and this is one well-sponsored car with 36 stickers! Given the size of the stickers, the level of detail is very good. Although I, like so many older builders, miss the days of the printed bricks.</p>

<h2>Putting the Bricks together</h2>

<p>Building this set follows the usual Speed Champions formula of being based around a chassis piece and SNOT attached features.</p>

<p>The sides are worth talking about as I&rsquo;m a little obsessed and impressed with the simple layering techniques they used. Starting with upper 4&times;2 curved roof tiles and a 1&times;2 curved tile. Then with 1&times;1 and 1&times;2 wedges to meet the bottom of the door. then towards the back of&nbsp;the door is another triangle completing the door and meeting with the arch of the rear wheel perfectly.</p>

<p><img alt=""Side Detailing "" src=""https://gjbricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/LEGO-Speed-Champions-Ford-Fiesta-M-Sport-WRC-75885-SIDE-Details-1024x713.jpg"" style=""width: 1024px; height: 713px;"" /></p>

<p>It&rsquo;s interesting to see the random colour blocks they use in the hidden areas of the car as well. Sometimes they could be to hint at details like suspension. But in this case, they seem to be there just to provide some variety and possibly to make the parts easier to find.</p>

<h2>The Finished Ford Fiesta M Sport WRC Model&nbsp;</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m a real fan of the almost caricature look that LEGO requires. The overall shape of it is not quite the same shape as the real car but it&rsquo;s very close. One nice detail is that you can swap the bonnet for one without the nighttime running lights, which as another dimension to this already great set.</p>

<p><img alt=""Driver and his machine"" src=""https://gjbricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/LEGO-Speed-Champions-Ford-Fiesta-M-Sport-WRC-75885-Ready-to-race-1024x747.jpg"" style=""width: 1024px; height: 747px;"" /></p>

<p>There is heavy use, as expected, of the Ford Blue with the white of the race team bricks everywhere. Combined with the lively sponsor sticker selection I think it gives the whole thing a very sporty feel. I also like the roof intake.</p>

<p>The driver is a cheeky chap and has a slightly angry mischievous look on his face. As always the printing is up to the same quality as the sticker sheet, and I think he looks rather good. All the logos are obvious and most recognisable for the brands they are.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Recommendation</h2>

<p>Overall I&rsquo;m am very happy with how the Fiesta looks and I cannot recommend it enough. The quality and overall look of the car is superb!&nbsp;And when you compare the overall look to earlier sets in the LEGO Speed Champions range, the designers have evolved the design language into something that&rsquo;s fun and great to look at.</p>

<p>The Fiesta WRC is another top entry in the Speed Champions range. It&#39;s also quite a bit different to the other cars being based on a smaller car.</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-06-18T15:08:58.66Z","Cool car, but not for sticker haters","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>A fun little car to build, that I bought more or less on impulse. I liked the looks, it looks a bit like a rally car, with the colours and the stickers on them. And yes, this car is not for sticker-haters, as there are 37 included in this set. There were people who complained about the 65 or so stickers in the <strong>Ninjago City (set 70618)</strong>, a set of almost 4900 pieces. If that set had the same sticker to part ratio as this one, it would come down to over 880 stickers in total! Personally, I think the stickers look great on this set. It is nice to have a day-light and night set-up, as well as two sets of rims for the tires. There are a lot of small sloped pieces in this set. Even if you just want a nice car to race around, this will do very well (even without the stickers). The build itself is easy. Generally I am happy with this car, and think it offers good value for money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>I chose to first put on the stickers on the separate parts, then put the whole set together. To&nbsp;me that seemed the best way to go, as I use Windex in order to be able to move the stickers around a bit and&nbsp;to properly line them up. Taking my time, it was none too difficult to get it done, and to me not a pain at all. Mind you, many of the stickers are quite small.</p>

<p>The base construction of the car was similar to that of other vehicles. Building up the side-walls it was interesting to see how the designer has tried to recreate the odd curves and angles. IMHO he/she has done quite a good job of that. Construction itself is easy, and something a 7 years old should be able to do easily.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There is only one minifigure, with a nicely printed (racing) overall on the front and back of the torso, and the front of the legs. There is only a single face print (somewhat of a smirk), and he only has a helmet and wrench. The latter can be used to change the wheel-hubs, BTW. Overall a nice figure, but nothing special</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Undoubtedly the dimensions of the car are off, compared to the actual vehicle. Yet to me, the whole car looks great. It looks like a rally car, and the option to put on night-head lights is IMHO a big bonus (and I prefer that look). The stickers definitely help a lot with making the car look like a real rally car. Overall, they line up nicely (if stickers are on bricks next to each other), and none seem to be out of register.This is especially important for the stickers on the roof, as they are large and very visible. I also like the option of two different rims for the tires. There are a number of brightly coloured pieces in the core of the car, but they are nicely covered up. Overall, IMHO this looks like the agile rally car it is supposed to represent.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This car makes a nice little car to race around, even without the stickers. In many ways, I would argue that is this car is meant for play, one should leave the stickers off, as they get easily damaged and scratched; IMHO that would be a shame, looking as good as they do. As a display piece, it is a little on the small side, but striking enough that it can work.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Personally, I like this car a lot. The price is good, it looks good, and offers a nice bit of play. Whether you like the stickers is more of a personal matter. As with most cars in the Speed Champions range, whether you like them probably has a lot to do with the looks. Assuming the build quality of the other sets is as good as this one, that would IMHO be pretty much the only reason why not to pick one up if you are looking for a little model car. Personally, I think it unlikely I will pick up another Speed Champions car soon; this has nothing to do with the build quality, lack of fun during building or a bad price. It has all to do with me not liking the looks of the other cars - just as happens in real life.</p>

<p>Set number: 75885</p>

<p>Theme: SPEED Champions</p>

<p>Pieces: 203</p>

<p>Year: 2018</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Quick Review&nbsp;</p>

<p>Small set but really fun build. Interesting parts placement. Two hoods and two sets of rims. Loads of stickers. Great minifig scale car. Lots of swooshability.</p>

<p>Full Build Review</p>

<p>This LEGO Speed Champions, small, set at 203 pieces but was a really enjoyable build. It has some unique parts placement to really create the authentic rally car style of the Ford WRC in LEGO.</p>

<p>The set has an alternate bonnet with a light pod, really useful for those night special stages, and alternate rims to give either a tarmac or gravel look to the wheels.</p>

<p>The big downside for me was the large number of stickers with 36!! It felt like I was putting a sticker on just about every external piece.</p>

<p>It is the standard single mini cockpit car affair of a one piece chassis base built up from there with small plates to form the majority of panels. The unique use of parts to create the angles for the hood and side skirts to give it that rally car look made it an interesting build if a short one.</p>

<p>It has been a while since I built a minifig scale car and this has inspired me to grab some more as it was a nice little build and will give lots of cool playability around the lego city special stages.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">The car is short and small, just as the real rally car. This Speed Champions car has a lot of details. A spoiler in the back, side skirt, air intake for the roof, a black sticker on the windscreen for shading from the sun and an optional lightbar.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">One of the reasons that this car looks great is because the rear wheels sit one plate higher than the front wheels. This makes the car front heavy and give the car an aggressive stance. You also get two different par of wheel cover, nice.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">It is a complicated build with 37 different stickers and 203 pieces. This car as a lot of interesting and unique building technics. One example is the side that has two assembly, an assembly on the underside and one on the side. The build of the spoiler is also interesting. It is using a special piece. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">One weird thing about the building process is all the yellow pieces.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">The sidebuild is useful. It is a lightbar for driving in the dark. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">After watching JANGBRICKS review, I wanted to change the front of the car to make it more like a Ford Fiesta. The biggest problem with this car is that the bumper is sticking too long out forward. Therefor the front of the car looks weird. I experimented with the spare parts to make the bumper smaller and smoother. I took all the parts away from the front and tested three different design. One with a flat front, one with a more curved front and one with the curved piece. I ended up with a fourth design, to use the &ldquo;fang&rdquo; shape piece to make the grill rounder. To make this modification you need to remove some parts after you have build the car. Remove everything except from the two &ldquo;fang&rdquo; shape pieces and the grill piece. Now you need to reattach the two pieces on each side but without the triangle piece. After you remove the curved piece with brick, you need to fill in the gap. Use the spare part for this, one 1x1 white flat tile and one 1x1 dark blue flat tile. Now the car looks more accurate to the real car.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif""><b>Stickers</b></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">This car has 37 different stickers in all shapes and sizes. Six stickers in the back, Eight stickers in the front, four stickers on each side and twelve stickers for the entire roof and spoiler. The roof sticker is on piece that is broken up in six stickers. The sidebuild has three stickers. The question is, is this car the most sticker heavy of all the Speed Champions car?</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">To apply the stickers in the best way you need tweezers, good light, white background and a steady hand. You also need to wipe the brick clean and dust free. To prevent the stickers to get loose over time. It is very easy to get the stickers wrong. Some stickers are best position off center because it follows, a line from the surround stickers. Most of stickers should be position in center and that could be difficult. It is best to hold the car right under the lamp to best see the outlines. 37 stickers are therefore too much. It demands so much from the builder </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">One thing that is positive about the sticker sheet is the layout. It has a good overview and is good organized. If you for example need the stickers for the front, all the stickers for that area is grouped together so you don&rsquo;t need to look everywhere for them. The stickers also looks amazing with the blue and white in a complicated pattern. </span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">The bottom line is this: I know that real rally car is very colorful and detailed, so the sticker sheet is an important piece of this car, but 37 different stickers is too much.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">This is a detailed and very realistic rally car that looks very close to the real car. The stickers do that job.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""font-size:11pt""><span style=""line-height:107%""><span style=""font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif"">I hope LEGO will make more rally car in the future, but with less stickers.</span></span></span></p>
