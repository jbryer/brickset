"Duq","2018-11-06T23:06:03.03Z","A missed opportunity","<p>There&#39;s a lot going on in this set; three completely different cars, a bit of track, a bit of garage and a bit of museum. There are more Speed Champions sets that follow this pattern, like&nbsp;75912:&nbsp;Porsche 911 GT Finish Line from 2015,&nbsp;75876:&nbsp;Porsche 919 Hybrid and 917K Pit Lane from 2016 and&nbsp;75883:&nbsp;Mercedes AMG Petronas Formula One Team from 2017. As well as looking at the elements in this set I&#39;ll compare the set to the sets I just mentioned.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the elements in this set in the order I built them. I tend to ignore the order in the instructions and leave the cars for last.</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>First I built the section of track with the arch made of two sections of rollercoaster track from bag 6. It only took minutes to build and I can&#39;t say I found it particularly interesting to build or to look at.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next were bags 4&amp;5 to make the garage/museum area. The wall sections are very straightforward, being made mostly from 6x5 panels and 1x1x5 and 1x2x5 bricks,&nbsp;but the ramp with it&#39;s lifting mechanism was fun. My favourite bit here though is the retro petrol pump.</p>

<p>The first car I built was the 488 GTE. Having built set&nbsp;75886:&nbsp;Ferrari 488 GT3 Scuderia Corsa&nbsp;the night before this was a bit too familiar. The two cars are 95% identical to build. The build follows a familiar pattern for Speed Champions cars with a fair bit of SNOT going on. The front splitter is interesting as it uses the new &#39;stud-bar&#39; part combined with an upside-down 2x6 rounded plate. One important difference between this car and the GT3 is stickers. This car is full of them. I mean full. There&#39;s barely a part on the outside of the car that isn&#39;t covered. I don&#39;t have statistics to hand but 39 stickers on a car with less than 200 parts may well be a record. As a result the car took quite a while to build.</p>

<p>Next I built the GTO. Far fewer stickers luckily. For the most part the car follows the usual pattern but the back is quite different, connecting at an angle that reminded me a bit of the front of the GT40.</p>

<p>I kept my favourite&nbsp;car for last, the 312 T4 Formula 1 car. The build is not that difficult with only very few parts used sideways. The front uses an interesting combination of jumper parts.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>You&#39;ll find the usual selection of Speed Champions parts; vehicle bases, brackets and lots of tiles and curved slopes. There&#39;s a handful of the pizza-slice tiles and two of the new triangle tiles. Two of the curved rollercoaster tracks that seem to be finding a lot of use outside of rollercoasters&nbsp;are included. There&#39;s also a few of the new rounded 1x2 plates and the &#39;stud-bars&#39;. A special mention has to go to the minifig rollerskate.&nbsp;This set a trophy made with a rollerskate, like 7 other Speed Champions sets. In a theme with only 28 sets that has to be a record...</p>

<h3>Minifigs</h3>

<p>There are 7 characters in this set; 3 drivers, 2 team staff and 2 fans/visitors. The crew wear the same outfit, a simple Ferrari branded shirt. One of the two is female judging by the subtle lipstick. I would have preferred a female hair piece for her rather than the cap. One of the visitors wears a tan Aran jumper. I&#39;m not convinced that a woolly jumper is the best choice for a race fan in Italy.<br />
The three drivers have nicely printer overalls, especially the drivers of the classic cars. Some people complain that it&#39;s strange to have a woman drive Gilles Villeneuve&#39;s car but I think that&#39;s nonsense. This is a museum, a historic car being driven by an enthousiast. And if it really bothers you it&#39;s easy to just swap heads with one of the other drivers.</p>

<h3>The models</h3>

<p>Most speed champions sets come with some accessories to add some play value over just having a car. As this set has 3 cars you also get many extras. The main area is similar to the Porsche pit lane (75876); a garage with a lift, some tools on the wall and the trophy. Here one side of the structure is apparently a museum section with some model cars (more rollerskates!). While it makes good use of parts I feel they&#39;re trying to do too many things to go with the three very different cars. The secondary element is an arch with an outline of a tiny bit of track. For me this adds very little to the set as it looks very bare compared to the garage.<br />
The stars of the show are of course the cars. Let&#39;s start with the newest, the 488 GTE. As mentioned before this model is very similar to the 488 GT3 from set 75886. Having checked the source material I must say the designer has done a good job but the car just isn&#39;t pretty. With the blue sections and all the stickers it&#39;s just colour barf on wheels.<br />
The GTO is just really well done. The windscreen is a little too tall and the curves over the wheels a bit too pronounced but at this scale this is as close as you&#39;ll get.<br />
The 312 T4 F1 car is a simple but effective build. Yes, there are details missing but again, at this scale this is an impressive model and for me this was the main draw of the set.<br />
Overall I think this set is suffering from trying to be too much at once. The track section adds little and the GTE just doesn&#39;t fit in with the other two cars. With four modern Ferrari road cars and a modern F1 car already represented in the theme I think this set would have been better off as a Ferrari museum rather than a full Ferrari timeline. With a Testarossa or F40 instead of the GTE, and some more museum elements replacing the track section it would have been a stronger package.<br />
Most of the Speed Champion sets with two cars feature an old and new version of the same model, like the 911, Chevvy Camaro and Ford GT40 while others have focussed on a race team like the Porsche 911 GT and the Mercedes F1 sets. All those sets are more consistent than this one.<br />
One thing the bigger Speed Champions sets have in common is that they&#39;re not great value for money and this set is the worst in the theme. Based on &euro;15 per car that would leave &euro;55 for the garage, track section and 4 of the minifigs and they&#39;re just not worth that sort of money.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>For Ferrari fans and completionists this set is certainly recommended. As a play set it&#39;s ok but for the same money I would recommend the Mercedes F1 team set.<br />
Whatever type of buyer you are, wait for this set to be discounted to 25% or 30% off.<br />

"gdr36","2020-03-18T16:05:23.617Z","One of the Best Speed Champions Sets","<p>Overview: This set was released in 2018 and retailed for $100. It has 841 pieces and includes 7 minifigures, a garage, part of a track, and 3 Ferraris. I received it as a gift for Christmas after wanting&nbsp;it for months.</p>

<p>Minifigures: This set comes with a driver for each of the cars, 2 spectators, and 2 mechanics. None of them are very special but I like the printing on the 488 GTE driver.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build process: As a fairly experienced builder, it took me about 2 and a half hours to complete the set while taking my time. One of the reasons why it took so long was the massive amount of stickers, especially on the 488 GTE. Applying the stickers and lining them up was a bit stressful. The building techniques used were interesting but the set was still very easy&nbsp;to complete.</p>

<p>The models:&nbsp;</p>

<p>488 GTE: This was my least favorite of the builds. It is pretty much the same as 75886 Scuderia&nbsp;Corsa but with more colors and stickers. While the shaping is excellent, the overwhelming amount of colors&nbsp; makes the car look messy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>250 GTO: From what I&#39;ve seen, many people like this car the most out of the set. It is very beautiful and classic-looking with its many curves. The classic livery is also very cool. I find it really narrow, though, and the gap behind the rear wheels is not pretty. However, this is still a great model and one of the best in the Speed Champions range.</p>

<p>312 T4: I love Formula One, and the T4 has a beautiful and interesting design. I think the shaping of the lego model is great and I love the piece used as the headrest. I find the F1 Speed Champions to be some of the best because even though they are very oversized in relation to minifigures, the real cars&nbsp;only seat one person in the first place, while the rest of the cars in the line are supposed to seat 2 figures but only seat one. The rear wing and different sized wheels are also cool aspects of the T4. The one thing I don&#39;t like is that it&#39;s missing the nose cone completely.&nbsp; The body just connects to the front wing. This is still the best part of the set in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Garage and track: The garage is great. It has trophies and posters of the cars on the left side, and a gas pump, tools, and the alternate wing for the T4 on the right. I love the&nbsp;lift where you can elevate the cars. The track is easy to rearrange, but not that interesting and maybe used to bring up the price of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value: The value is really bad, which is why this set gets 4 stars. As duq, who reviewed this set a while before me&nbsp;mentioned, the cars alone would cost 45 dollars, and no way are the garage and track worth $55.</p>

<p>Verdict: This is my favorite Speed Champions set. I love Ferraris, and even though this set has a few minor flaws, it has good playability and is a great display piece. However, it&#39;s not worth the price of 100 dollars. If you&#39;re like me and hate the change to 8-stud width, though, these are some of the best 6-wide cars.&nbsp;You can still find this set for relatively cheap even though it is retired, so I think it&#39;s worth picking up for a discount if you already have Speed Champions and want to add to your collection.&nbsp;</p>
