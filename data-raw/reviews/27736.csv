This partivular set is, in my opinion, possibly the best car ever included in a Lego set.</p>

<p>The build time for this set relies largely upon how quick you are at applying stickers. It took me about 20 minutes. As a build, there&#39;s nothing hugely special, but it does use a new base piece not seen in speed champions before.</p>

<p>The set includes 1 minifigure, which is exactly what you&#39;d expect from a set of this size. This particular car was driven at Le Mans 2017 by&nbsp;Earl Bamber, Brendon Hartley and Timo Bernhard, but, as the head used is generic, I can&#39;t tell exactly who is being represented. The torso features stripes and sponsors and closely resembles the real suits. The plain legs and helmet don&#39;t bother me too much, as too much detail may look out of place.</p>

<p>As for the car itself, it appears very realistic compared to the real thing. Ok, it&#39;s too tall and narrow, but that&#39;s just how speed champions cars are designed. The car features fantastic details all over, and virtually all are brick built. I would give particular emphasis to the nose and the vents behind the front wheelarches, which are present on many real Le Mans Prototypes and hace been constructed brilliantly, with signs attached to plates with bars.</p>

<p>However, this is still a speed champions set, so I must finally talk about the inevitable issue of stickers; 25 are applied to the car. In adittion, I feel like the aditional build (a start light with a 2x2 platform) feels totally pointless, and I would rather the parts used for it were invested in the car, or left out altogether; the set feels like &pound;13 even minus the lights. The only complaint I have about the car itself is the fact that it looks a bit awkward from a low angle, where you can see the studs on the underside of the front splitter. This is particularly a shame as you&#39;ll want to display a set of this quality on a high shelf!</p>

<p>With christmas just around the corner, this set feels like the perfect gift for anyone who is a fan of cars, Porsche endurance racing or just great lego models in general. This set takes the title of my favourite speed champions set of the year and my favourite small set. Congratulations Lego, and bring on 2019!</p>
