"GJBricks","2018-04-14T11:35:28.85Z","One of the greatest Porsches in two fun versions","<p>I&#39;ll start by declaring that the&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porsche_911"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Porsche 911</a>&nbsp;is one of my all-time favourite cars. And in this set, you get 2! Brilliant! That&rsquo;s a pole position start in my books!</p>

<p>The box is in the usual Speed Champions design and is very well filled with 3 parts bag &ndash; Bag 1 for the 911 Turbo, bag 2 for the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.porsche.com/australia/motorsportandevents/motorsport/customerracing/racingcars/911-rsr/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">911 RSR</a>&nbsp;and bag 3 for the pit lane. Likewise, there are 2 high-quality manuals with book 1 doing the 911 Turbo and book 2 the 911 RSR and pit lane. Looking at the bags, you instantly see the colours clearly for each section of build with that bold green of the 911 Turbo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do have to have a slight grumble about how it is packaged which is consistent with what I&rsquo;ve said a few times previously. And that is about how the sticker sheets are packed. In this case, it is clearly stuffed in last, resulting in a bent sheet of stickers. Thankfully they weren&#39;t damaged as has happened to me before.</p>

<p>I haven&#39;t included the build details here as there&#39;s quite a lot to follow. But if you want to read a bit more on that, go and read my longer <a href=""https://gjbricks.com/lego-review/lego-speed-champions-porsche-911-rsr-and-911-turbo-3-0-75888-review/"" target=""_blank"">review</a>.</p>

<h2>The Finished Porsche 911 Turbo and 911 RSR</h2>

<p>Both cars and indeed the pit lane all look great together! Everything in the set is very complimentary of one another&nbsp;and the whole set works really well together.</p>

<h3>Porsche 911 Turbo</h3>

<p>Like I said, the Porsche 911 is one of my favourite cars and this&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Speed-Champions"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">LEGO Speed Champions</a>&nbsp;version brings that car to brick life perfectly.</p>

<p><img alt=""LEGO Speed Champions Porsche 911 Turbo 3.0 75888 Side Profile"" src=""https://gjbricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/LEGO-Speed-Champions-Porsche-911-Turbo-3.0-75888-Side-Profile-1024x512.jpg"" style=""width: 1024px; height: 512px;"" /></p>

<p>From the side profile, you can see the classic 911 shape that has evolved over the years. That flat front building up the bonnet, the windscreen and into the sloping rear of the car to that classic oversized wing. Splendid! You can also see those Technic connected wheels under that arches.</p>

<p>I usually do a top-down shot of the car, but as the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.lego.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">LEGO</a>&nbsp;Designers did something a bit different, so have I. This angle shows the interior where they&rsquo;ve used brown pieces to mimic the interior of the car.</p>

<p><img alt=""LEGO Speed Champions Porsche 911 Turbo 3.0 75888 Interior"" src=""https://gjbricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/LEGO-Speed-Champions-Porsche-911-Turbo-3.0-75888-Interior-1024x871.jpg"" style=""width: 1024px; height: 871px;"" /></p>

<p>One pleasant surprise I hadn&rsquo;t noticed on the packaging was that the&nbsp;driver is a female. As you&rsquo;d expect, driving such a great car she is smiling from ear to ear. Her outfit is&nbsp;simple &ndash; I think denim &ndash; jacket front and back with a good clean print. Her face is only printed on one side.&nbsp;?????&nbsp;<span style=""display: none;"">&nbsp;</span><span style=""display: none;"">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3>Porsche 911 RSR</h3>

<p>This car has a lot more going on in the finished build the 911 as you&rsquo;d expect. There&rsquo;s a lot of little details and angles throughout the car to capture the aerodynamics and air vents of the race car &ndash; note the black pieces just behind the driver&#39;s door. You can see the similarities in the shape, but you have to remember this car is decades newer so has softer angles. The stickers show off the sponsors as well as adding flashes of colour.</p>

<p><img alt=""LEGO Speed Champions Porsche 911 RSR 75888 Side Profile and Driver"" src=""https://gjbricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/LEGO-Speed-Champions-Porsche-911-RSR-75888-Driver.jpg"" style=""width: 669px; height: 293px;"" /></p>

<h3>Pit Lane</h3>

<p>The final piece is the pit lane. It&rsquo;s a really simple build but its addition adds so much to the set&rsquo;s aesthetic and playability. The motion of turning the lap counter and pit board to show positions makes you want to race lap after lap &ndash; well 4 anyway being a square piece. The red and white pieces give a burst of life.</p>

<p><img alt=""LEGO Speed Champions Porsche 911 RSR and 911 Turbo 3.0 75888 Pit Board"" src=""https://gjbricks.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/LEGO-Speed-Champions-Porsche-911-RSR-and-911-Turbo-3.0-75888-Pit-Board-1024x864.jpg"" style=""width: 1024px; height: 864px;"" /></p>

<p>I did make one modification to this pit lane which was to move the flag holder along slightly. This meant that the pit guy could stand next to the wall and hold the pit board through the gap. Otherwise, you&rsquo;d never see the board.</p>

<h2>Conclusion and Final Recommendation</h2>

<p>So what can I do at this point other than recommend it? This is a slightly more expensive set as it features two cars and the pit lane. But at&nbsp;&pound;34.99 (GBP),&nbsp;$29.99(USD)and&nbsp;$49.99 (AUD)&nbsp;it&rsquo;s still really good value.</p>

<p>You get two cars, one of which is a piece of automotive history. Add to that lots of play features through the pit lane and a great selection of parts and you have a set that will be enjoyed by any car enthusiast &ndash; or soon to be&nbsp;an enthusiast!&nbsp;The playability seems to be a trend with the Porsche sets through the inclusion of more than just the cars.</p>

<p>I knew I would enjoy this set, but I have, again, underestimated just how much I would enjoy all aspects of it. Most satisfying. Now to find a home for it in my&nbsp;LEGO City.</p>

"KoolKreeper489","2018-11-25T23:30:03.283Z","Porsche 911 RSR and 911 Turbo 3.0 Review","<p>The&nbsp;Porsche 911 RSR and 911 Turbo 3.0 is a great set from the Speed Champions theme. It includes the&nbsp;Porsche 911 RSR,&nbsp;911 Turbo 3.0, a side build, and 3 minifigures. It was released in 2018 for $29.99 and has 391 pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><strong>Porsche 911 RSR Driver- </strong>Good average driver minifigure with nice torso printing. 8/10</p>

<p><strong>Classic Female Porsche Racing Driver- </strong>Decent minifigure with nice torso printing. 7/10</p>

<p><strong>Porsche 911 RSR Technician- </strong>Good minifigure with the same torso printing as the RSR Driver. 8/10</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The cars are great builds. They are fun to build but have a lot of stickers. The Porsche 911 RSR looks really good and has most of the stickers. The spoiler can move up and down and looks sleek. It also has extra rims you can switch out The Porsche 911 Turbo 3.0 also looks really good and is a nice classic Porsche. The lime green color is nice and this car doesn&#39;t have many stickers. The side build is a nice race track build that shows the lap number.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great set with nice builds. Even though it has a lot of stickers it is still fun to build. The minifigures are ok but this set is mainly for the cars. I would recommend this set if you are a fan of Porsche or a fan of cars in general.&nbsp;</p>

"DGBM1978","2018-12-27T12:24:30.513Z","Great set but children need help with stickers","<p>Stunning and iconic cars with both male and female race driver minifig - a massive plus for my daughter. An added bonus is the two different build experience for cars that look similar. once built, they feel sturdy and look amazing, Very playable too for my 6-year old.</p>

<p>One major drawback is the amount of stickers. 11 for the green car, 25 for the white car and another 11 for the pit wall. There&#39;s no way a 7-year old has the dexterity to place them properly. Even at 40 I had difficulties despite using tweezers.</p>
