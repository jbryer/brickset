"Minifig290","2018-03-31T21:57:08.187Z","Great Little Easter Gift","<p>Before I start I&#39;d like to wish everyone a Happy&nbsp;Easter, now this set is a great set with some useful elements.</p>

<p><b>Minifigure</b></p>

<p>As this set resolves around this little fellow let&#39;s talk about him first, He reuses the series 7 cmf bunny ears with the same color, and his legs are just simple plain white Minifigure&nbsp;legs with no detail sadly. Now his torso has a new and exclusive print on it with printing for a jacket and his furry belly, and his head has on it two of his teeth showing (his face is not duel sided for those wandering).</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>Now one thing I like about this little box promo compared to the Iconic<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Chick and Gingerbread man from 2016 is that there are two accessories for extra play, these are a paint brush with a light blue print on the end instead of the normal green print and an egg with a pattern that goes all around the part which was first released unprinted in 2016 with the Angry Birds theme</p>

<p><strong>Display Box (packaging)</strong></p>

<p>Unlike most sets nowadays the box for the set can be used as a display case as well and is detailed perfectly. the front has a door with a bunny face on it and door handle next to the door there is a light and flowery detail, Each side has a window so does the back. The rear window shows two little builds for a duck and chick.</p>

<p>______________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Overall for a freebie this set is great and well made in a great and reusable box but if your going to pay the prices at Sainsbury&#39;s&nbsp; which is &pound;4 it dose seem a bit pricey for me but that my opinion, and also the availability of this set isn&#39;t the greatest as it is only at Lego Shop and a few Sainsbury&#39;s stores in the UK and Ireland.</p>

<p><b>Pros</b>- Exclusive parts and prints, great box</p>

<p><b>Cons</b>- Price, Availability&nbsp;</p>

(Buckteeth!)&nbsp; Lego nailed the Easter Coloring on it.&nbsp; In terms of overall appearance it&#39;s is an excellent looking minfig, only behind my&nbsp; Tie fighter pilot.&nbsp; One thing that did surprise me is that it only had one face print, something i notice becuse his headgear pop off while i took him out of the box.&nbsp; Lego has made the packaging seem like part of the set.&nbsp; The box art is very nice.&nbsp; I actually have the box siting beside my other sets.</p>
