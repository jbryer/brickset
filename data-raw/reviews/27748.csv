<p>60 years of the Lego brick is the best gift with purchase since the 2014 darth revan .</p>

<p>The builds-</p>

<p>Yellow castle is a very iconic set and the micro build lives up to it . It even possess the main feature that the original had openable walls . Now that&#39;s attention to detail and accuracy . The space explorer is a great micro rendition to its predecessor and is surprisingly playable as the ship can be detached and swooshed about . The control room , moon rover , landing pad and craters are excellent added details . The shuttle transport is unfortunately not the complete set as only a snipit of the elevated railway is present which does make sense for consistency . The details are very accurate with the stairs and stand . And last and not least is black seas baricuda based of the beloved 80s classic set this one is also very accurate and we&#39;ll built .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this a great promo my main issue is the fact that the sails and masts of black seas are not in a fixed position which can be irritating for display purposes I would if you have the chance to get it highly recommend it.</p>

"ryan_c_byrd","2022-07-11T17:51:20.853Z","Good Little Builds","<p>I got this set used after it was retired.&nbsp; Being born in the 70s, I remember seeing all these sets in the stores, but I never owned any of them.&nbsp; I never had these sets on my wish list, but I did admire them. This set scratches that itch of having suitably small replacements for the originals without spending lots of money.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Monorail - I do remember seeing it on display at Toys R Us and being a bit mesmerized.&nbsp; This build is decent, but the weakest of them all.&nbsp; It would be almost unrecognizable if you did not know the source material.&nbsp; Despite that, it does capture lots of good details.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Castle - Some working features (such as working draw bridge and hinged towers) make this set strong.&nbsp; Weaknesses include lack of detail on the tower tops and the back doors do not actually open, despite being hinged.&nbsp; But, it is instantly recognizable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Galaxy Explorer - Maybe the best looking of the 4 builds.&nbsp; Quite a well detailed build, even down to the moon base with crater plate, landing plate, and rover.&nbsp; The ship looks great, despite the scale.&nbsp; No hinged back, which can be forgiven considering it is only a 4 stud wide build.&nbsp; Any classic space fan will know this build from a distance.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pirate ship - I had a friend with the original, but I was never into pirates.&nbsp; Lots of good details here, including sails, cannons, flags, railings.&nbsp; The body shape is a little off.&nbsp; But, a half stud offset makes the poop deck fit nicely.&nbsp; The only real concern is that the masts allow for the sails to spin around with gravity.&nbsp; I just put some 4L rods inside them to keep them stiff.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other thoughts - There is a simple brick display as well.&nbsp; It is not very interesting and only serves to remind you that this was a commemorative set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Four builds in one set!</p>

<p>Parts are pretty easy to source, making it easy to make any of the models on your own.</p>

<p>Not very expensive</p>

<p>Most builds look great.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Monorail is lack luster, but well done.</p>

<p>Masts on ship need strengthening.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>A really nice set that offers multiple builds at a low cost.&nbsp; The builds look great and really capture the source material, including some small details.&nbsp; Well worth the price.</p>
