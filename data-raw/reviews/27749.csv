I like the circular stand and the symmetry thereof; that&#39;s the main thing that helps this stand out from the others.<br />
Like those, this has movable joints, which really adds to the playability, realism, and cuteness factor. The head being able to rotate all the way (The Exorcist puppy!) is funny. The conical piece with a round tile on top was a new way to do the snout, and this has 2x2 eyes next to each other rather than spaced 1x1&#39;s.<br />
During the build, the dog doesn&#39;t start to take shape until the tail step and not really until you assemble the head.<br />
This has a box with a flip open top. Usually those are larger, but this is still nice for storing the instructions and gift envelope.<br />
It&#39;s hard to judge the value of a promo set, but I did get a good deal on the stuff I bought to get it. I am glad I kept rather than traded this one.</p>
