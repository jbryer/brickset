"Koot","2018-01-01T10:12:45.773Z","LEGO Star Wars 75205 Mos Eisley Cantina","<p>It has not even been 4 years and we have gotten another Cantina. This time, LEGO has made one that is smaller, more affordable and more&nbsp;like the 2004 variant than the 2014 one.</p>

<p><strong>The Model:</strong></p>

<p>This section of the Cantina has 3 main parts. There is a booth, designed for Han and Greedo. There is a function where you can flip the minifigure off the chair, implying they got shot. There is also an entrance section, with a sliding door and a droid detector. The set also comes with a nicely detailed bar.</p>

<p>This set features an interesting inclusion of a spherical landspeeder (specifically&nbsp;Ubrikkian&nbsp;9000 Z001) The top hatch opens up for a large cockpit with a printed control panel. On the top, there is a detachable stud shooter.</p>

<p><strong>The minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>In this set you get the updated Han Solo, Greedo, Sandtrooper and the much-awaited Wuher&nbsp;(the bartender). For this price range this is a pretty nice selection of minifigures, but one more Sandtrooper&nbsp;would have been great.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>I would definitely recommend this set to anyone who does not have a version of the Cantina already. I think the price is reasonable as you get an exclusive minifigure and the set is playable.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading and I hope this was very helpful.</p>

"MovieNerd","2019-01-04T06:10:37.467Z","Pretty Weak Version of the Famous Scene","<p>I had missed out on the previous two versions of the Mos Eisley Cantina as they always seemed to be released during my dark periods, so I was excited to get the chance to buy this new one for a reasonable $40. Unfortunately, it is a pretty disappointing set.</p>

<p>The Minifgs:</p>

<p>The minifigs&nbsp;are one of the set&#39;s few saving graces. You get the first ever version of Wuher&nbsp;(the droid hating bartender), and they pulled out all the stops. The printing on his torso is great and you get two great expressions on his dual sided head. We also get a new version of Greedo which gets a welcome upgrade to his torso and head mold. He is unfortunately missing the belt printing on his leg piece though. Also included are a pretty solid Sandtrooper, and a decent Han Solo if you are lucky to get a version with a non-discolored torso.</p>

<p>The Build:</p>

<p>The building construction is pretty basic, and there aren&#39;t really any surprises or challenges. The little pod thing is kind of fun to build as you see it all come together, but the Cantina itself is dull.</p>

<p>The Set:</p>

<p>The completed model is where the set falters. Based off the film, the layout is entirely wrong for where the bar, door, and Greedo and Han&#39;s showdown at the table takes place. The bar is incorrectly shaped, and as interesting as the sliding door is, the Cantina didn&#39;t have one. Just an open doorway. The only neat pieces are the before mentioned Pod, and Han and Greedo&#39;s&nbsp;table is actually pretty nice in it&#39;s simplicity. The &quot;blaster dodging&quot; play feature is unnecessary, but is hidden well enough that you&#39;d never now its there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final Thoughts:</p>

<p>With many places clearancing&nbsp;this set out, now is the time to pick it up if you can find it for under $30. Its worth getting cheap for the figures at least, but this is far from the definite Mos Eisley Cantina set. Maybe one day, we&#39;ll get a worthy hive of scum and villiany.</p>

"vikings","2020-07-05T07:21:01.07Z","Mos Eisley Cantina","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a medium size box and&nbsp;with a medium/small size instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some decent parts in this set. You get four clear medium size dishes, three clear cups, a white cockpit lid. You get three printed pieces, two are the same and one is different. You get one&nbsp;1x1 light grey keypad tile and two&nbsp;1x2 dark grey roof tile with a control panel printed on it. One of the panels is at the bar and the other is inside the pod and the keypad is outside by the door. You get 15 stickers in this set as well. 3 are on/in the Cantina and the other 12 are on the pod. Overall a decent piece haul with a good amount of stickers. The total piece count for this set is 378.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Han:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>It is nice to get Han in this set to showcase such an iconic scene from Star Wars. Han has his &ldquo;newer&rdquo; brown hair piece. It does a nice job of capturing his iconic look. He has a double-sided head. On one side he has neutral-ish expression on the other side he has a smile on his face. He has printing on both sides of torso. On the front you have his black jacket with four pockets (two on each side) with light grey under shirt with the&nbsp;collar of the shirt showing. He has tan&nbsp;arms. On the back you have printing of just the black jacket. He has printing on his dark blue legs. He has a belt and a&nbsp;holster with buckle for his pistol. He is armed with just a pistol.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Greedo:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Greedo is a great figure to get as he isn&#39;t overally common to get/find. He has a hard plastic head with his big ears. He has a lot of bumps all over his head and his big blue sparkly eyes that really capture his Rodian look. He has printing on both sides of his torso. On the front you have a tan/orange jacket with four pockets (two on each side) with a light blue under shirt. He has a belt with a silver belt buckle as well. He has light blue arms with light green hands. On the back you have the tan/orange jacket. He has printing on the front of his legs. He has light blue legs with a holster strap with a silver buckle/joint for his blaster. He is armed with a black pistol.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Sandtrooper:</strong></p>

<p>The Sandtrooper is a nice figure to get in this set. You have the normal Stormtrooper helmet with&nbsp;tan&nbsp;sand stains&nbsp;on it. He has the normal Storm/Clone trooper head. He has a hard cloth shoulder piece on his&nbsp;right shoulder. He has a clear 1x2 back plate for his pack (I am not a fan of it doesn&#39;t look as good in my opinion. It is just to big). The Sandtrooper has printing on both sides of his torso. He has normal Stormtrooper armor except there is a black clip/pack thing on his left chest area (I don&#39;t know exactly what it is but it looks nice). You also get the tan sand stains on the armor as well. On the back, again you get&nbsp;normal Stormtrooper armor with tan sand stains all over. You also get printing on the legs as well. The legs are normal Stormtrooper armor with again tan sand stains all over. The Sandtrooper is armed with a black blaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Wuher:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Wuher is a great figure to get in this set. He has a dark brown hair piece. He has a double-sided head. On one side he has a neutral expression with a stubble beard and a brown to light grey side burns on the other side he has an angry expression that looks like he is yelling at someone. He has printing on both sides of his torso. On the front you have a tan shirt with a brown belt and a silver belt buckle with a V-neck on the shirt showing some chest hair. On the back you have the tan shirt with brown belt. He has plain dark brown legs. He has a pistol as a weapon which is &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; next to the control panel at the bar or a clear cup as an accessory.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was pretty easy and straight forward. There was nothing hard to it. You had four separate builds (If you count the three sections of the cantina as individual builds). You have the pod and the three sections of the cantina (Bar, front door, and booth). The build took me around 30 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a pretty decent set. I highly recommend not paying the 44.99 USD (I bought this set used for 20.00 USD in great condition) If you can pay 30.00 USD or&nbsp;less for this set it is worth it. The minifigures are great to get and are the highlight of the set for me. Getting Han and Greedo to recreate the scene with them is great. Getting Wuher for the first time is nice as well as getting a Sandtrooper to grow your Imperial Army. The builds are nice (But all have something wrong with them, in my opinion). The pod is really nice and surprisingly accurate to it in the movie. The cockpit lid opens up revealing a control panel and a spot for a pilot. You have 12 stickers on it which are really accurate to what you see in the movie. It has a stud shooter on top which I find just pointless. It was not shown as having it in the movie and seems like a really bad attempt at a play feature. Overall really nice pod. The three sections of the cantina are really nice alone. You get the bar, the door/entrance, and a booth (or where Greedo and Han have there shoot out). The bar is really great. I&nbsp;do wish it wasn&#39;t just half and that they made it so you could add another half to it to create a full bar. You have an area for&nbsp;Wuher&#39;s pistol next to the register. The gold parts used to create the bar are just great. Next you have the entrance to the bar. You have a play feature in that you can the slide the door open and close. You have three stickers on&nbsp;this part which are&nbsp;the sign on the outside and the other two on the control panel for the door. This is the middle part of the cantina and you connect the other two parts to this one. The last part is the booth. You have a play feature here in which you can launch&nbsp;Greedo and Han out of the booth as they shoot at each other. The archways used here and at the entrance are really cool and add to the look of the cantina. My only problem is that how they all connect is really bad (in my opinion). The bar is partially behind the entrance and the register part completely block and makes no sense as it should be more the center part of the cantina. The play feature with the booth makes it so there is a gap between it and the entrance part and doesn&#39;t really look great (especially from the exterior). I highly recommend this set to any Star Wars fan/collector (just not for the price of 44.99 USD). If you aren&#39;t into Star Wars you can definitely pass on this set, but if do buy it will make a nice addition to anyones Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 3-star rating.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"wingnutjb","2019-09-13T23:37:17.103Z","A bit of a mess","<p>Bought this on sale and thought it would stand alongside 75052 nicely.&nbsp; Sadly it doesn&#39;t.&nbsp; It neither matches nor complements it.&nbsp; I&#39;m unsure if that should surprise me or not given this set has little consistency within itself.&nbsp; Destined to be parts in the very near future, but not bad for that as it has quite a few bricks.</p>

<p>The minifigures are all great&nbsp;individually and for this scene. Greedo is more detailed and better than that in 75052.&nbsp; Wuher is as unpleasant and unkempt as he should be.&nbsp; The sand trooper is great, and Han is Han.</p>

<p>Hard to know who this was made for given the&nbsp;Ubrikkian 9000 will mean little to most people, and the cantina itself is a bit rubbish for all.&nbsp; Probably those willing to pay a little too much for Wuher I suspect.</p>
