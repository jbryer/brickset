<p>Great parts for cartoony themes such as this one. Mojo Jojo is a good figure, however the cape won&#39;t ever go down. Meh price as it should&#39;ve been around $20-25 instead of $30. An ok building experience, but lacks in playability as it&#39;s just buildings mostly. Meaning the playability is just ok, being saved by the car and the window play feature.</p>
