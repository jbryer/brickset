The parts for this were just like every other Brickheadz&nbsp;figure basic body with added outer decor to fit the theme.&nbsp; I did think the rose bushes were a clever way to do the flowers and the wings being movable was a nice touch.</p>

<p>As I said, I am not a fan of Brickheads. I feel that they are rather simplistic for an adult.&nbsp; That being said, if you are a parent with kids, this is an excellent way to get you child into Lego.&nbsp; It also is good as a decoration piece.&nbsp; Thats what I use it for and it looks good on the mantle or shelf.</p>

<p>To sum it up.&nbsp; If you are an adult and want some nice holiday decoration, this is good.&nbsp; Just don&#39;t expect some exciting build. If you are an Adult or child wanting to dip your feet into Lego, this is for you.&nbsp; It will teach you the Lego basics.</p>

This is a very cute little set, but didn&rsquo;t sell very well since it was still available well into 2019 from the LEGO Store at a discount. The set is pretty impressive, but a bit everywhere with the design. A true shame that not a lot enjoyed this set, once I picked it up I did kind of see just how fun it was.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A Bee makes a very odd gift for Valentine&rsquo;s Day. The box has a pinkish red hue to it and looks pretty good, it features shots of all the Seasonal BrickHeadz from 2018 on the back and shows the one feature this set uses. The packaging design is the same as every other BrickHeadz, so really not a whole lot to say. The manual in the set is folded though, which is really unfortunate as you know from most of my BrickHeadz reviews.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Great selection of parts indeed, aside from the usual parts you find in BrickHeadz this set includes two of the flower stem elements with a load of red flowers to attach to them. Overall a decent selection of parts here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Building a bee as a BrickHeadz can be really fun, the yellow orange elements with the black works so well. Although I am a bit unsure why this particular bee has pink cheeks, I think it&rsquo;s because he&rsquo;s a Valentine&rsquo;s Bee, but honestly the build works. The stand is larger with additional elements added and you can customize this with two different types of flowers. Solid build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The bee is a great BrickHeadz, generic and non-licensed the price and look is really fun. Love the wings, you also make a small hive and heart for the Bee to hold. The stand can have red roses&hellip; or more properly red flowers of indeterminate type which could be roses or a pair of sunflowers. Now this is an unusual choice, but works. This review might read poorly, I&rsquo;m afraid I may be struggling a bit to discuss it properly, BrickHeadz as a whole are fairly repetitive and this set is no different. But it does work, and it is nice to see a &lsquo;cartoon&rsquo; style bee build as animals are different from people. The stand can be a bit cluttered though if you try to attach all four flowers, making it harder for the Bee to stand properly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Truly a shame what happened when they switched to these seasonal BrickHeadz. I originally ignored this set because it just wasn&rsquo;t something I thought I&rsquo;d like, but as I built more and more of them I became slightly obsessed, so when I found this set on sale at a discount outlet I knew I wanted it. The printed Seasonal tile on the display base is also a really fun piece, and I&rsquo;m curious to see what more talented MOC fans might build with these BrickHeadz specific tiles. Overall though I&rsquo;d still only recommend this set for fans of the builds and design aesthetics of BrickHeadz. They make decent display items, but aren&rsquo;t very fun as toys. Recommended.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The playability of course isn&#39;t really good, as it&#39;s mostly just the wings. But then again, Brickheads are more for the display.&nbsp;The building experience wasn&#39;t really exciting as this would&#39;ve been better as a part of the new &quot;Brickheads&quot;&nbsp;pets subtheme.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>It just doesn&#39;t really translate well as a regular brickhead. Parts&nbsp;are ok, such as the flower builds.&nbsp;The price is ok for being a brickhead with extra background included. They could&#39;ve raised the price to $15, but thankfully they didn&#39;t.</p>

"Randomness","2023-02-12T21:09:27.783Z","Still no leads in my search for the mystical Bee's Knees.","<p>It may be time to search outside of Lego sets, but for now, let&#39;s review.</p>

<h3><strong>BrickHead</strong></h3>

<p>&quot;No! I&#39;m the bee! Like, from nature.&quot;</p>

<p>The bee is very nice, although maybe a little simplistic in build. There are clips for the wings on the back, of course, but they&#39;re just attached with a 1x4 SNOT brick. The stinger is&nbsp;just attached by a singular technic pin in a brick that is a different colour than the orangish yellow of the rest of the bee, and the only interesting thing about the head is the antennae and I guess the blush, which aren&#39;t very complicated. It&#39;s pretty simple.</p>

<p>The accessories are not bad, really. The heart made of the two 2x2s with a loop thing on a side is a classic, and not too complicated, while the bucket &#39;o honey is also pretty simplistic. Overall, the bee is very easy to build and not too interesting outside being a bee.</p>

<h3><strong>Stand</strong></h3>

<p>The flowers are very nice, and much more interesting in themselves than the bee. The red ones are nice, as they have the stem piece which I really don&#39;t have any good amount of, so they&#39;re great to get. The sunflowers aren&#39;t too complicated, from the outside, but the taller one uses a stud with pole coming out the top supporting its height. It&#39;s nice.</p>

<p>Besides the big ones, there are two small ones made of two flowers. Just two. That&#39;s it. It&#39;s not a bad stand.</p>

<h3><strong>Pieces &amp; Price</strong></h3>

<p>There aren&#39;t any rare prices in here, unless you count the seasonal BrickHead print on the stand. The stem pieces are also good to get, although not too uncommon. It&#39;s not really a pack for parts.</p>

<p>The ppp is 14, at least at base price, although with price rise it&#39;s less than 10, so not great, but not super bad.</p>

<p>Overall, the pieces don&#39;t make this a get, and the price doesn&#39;t make it a deal, so this catagory doesn&#39;t make or break it.</p>

<h3><em><strong>El fin</strong></em></h3>

<p>It&#39;s a nice set, although the build isn&#39;t very complicated at all. The flowers are nice, and can all be put on the stand at once if you fanangle it right, so it&#39;s not bad.</p>

<p>The bee isn&#39;t a must-have, but it&#39;s still good. Get it if you want; it won&#39;t be a bad addition to your collection, it just won&#39;t be a great addition.</p>

<p>I give it approximately 4 stars.</p>
