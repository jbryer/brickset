Sadly this set has been quite difficult to get as when ever LEGO gets a stock of these they will sell out quickly. Lets look at this nice flower set.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>There are two flowers in this set a nice red rose and a large daisy. We&#39;ll look at the most romantic flower the rose first.</p>

<p><strong>Build 1: Rose</strong></p>

<p>Like both flowers, this rose has a nice build for a plant pot that has a few techniques. Using a repeated build of 4 1x1 black bricks with two studs onside on top of a 2x2 yellow round plate plus a 2x2 gray plate. On the bricks with stud on the sides, are 4 3 piece walls using a large white slope and two white plates.</p>

<p>The rose&#39;s stalk is almost fully green using a large 2x2x2 cone and 3 round 1x1 bricks, between two of the green round bricks is a black clip that is holding onto a nice hard to find light green claw piece ,that has only been released in one other set the &pound;179.99 ($279.99) 10255 Assembly Square, to represent a leaf. The stalk connects to the head of the rose using a red inverted cone that was first used in the 2016 Angry Birds theme for balloons. Speaking of the head, the head is built using a few types of slopes both normal and inverted, each petal is a 1x2x2 red slope with a 1x1 cheese slope on top that are all connected onto one of two 2x2 plate with inverted slopes on two sides</p>

<p><strong>Build 2: Daisy</strong></p>

<p>Now the daises pot is quite bland comparing to the roses pot, using 2 4x4 round red bricks with four small macaroni tiles in gold around the rims of the pot and that is it. The stalk of the daisy is identical to that of the roses.</p>

<p>The daises head has a white 2x2 round plate with clips around the entire side of the part connecting 8 petals to the flower. There is one type of petal used, using a 1x2 small slope, and inverted on of these plus a 1x1 plate and 1x1 plate with a clip on but there is only one difference with the 8 that is that 4 have a horizontal clip while the other has a vertical clip.</p>

<p><strong>__________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To conclude this review I&#39;ve got to say im quite disappointed with the daisy as it reminds me of the more interesting LEGO Friends Friendship Flower polybag that was released at the same time at this set, I&#39;ve also reviewed that set if you would like to check it out it even has a drop test. Back to this set, I love the roses pot just because its built very well using a quite nice technique that that Friends polybag also used weirdly enough. On the whole this set is the LEGO Friends Friendship Flower polybag but in two separate builds with one having a rose head instead of a daisy and a leaf and the other having a boring pot and leaf and one less head that the friends one had.</p>

<p>So on that basis I personally do not recommend this set for its originality as it so similar to that friends set that is available as of writing for just &pound;3.99 at LEGO stores. Though I do like the builds looks and it is quite a nice gift i suppose.</p>

<p><strong>Pros - </strong>Nice Colour scheme, great inclusion of the light green claw piece and red ballon base, great value with Price Per Part.</p>

<p><b>Cons - </b>Unoriginal in terms of building structure of idea, extremely similar to the LEGO Friends Friendship Flower, the daises pot is quite a boring build</p>
