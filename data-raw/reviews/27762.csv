(especially the husbands)&nbsp; The turning platforms for the bride &amp; groom are a good feature, as well as the microfigs&nbsp;for the wedding cake toppers are well thought out on this set.&nbsp; The optional color hairpieces allow you to customize the minifigs&nbsp;to your bride &amp; groom.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The groom is impeccably dressed in a proper suit here. The black and white, though simple, perfectly captures the moment. His face says it all; this is the happiest day of his life. The top hat looks splendid as well. Three options for hair are included too. In fact, these could be used on the bride to represent a shorter haircut.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of the bride, she stands tall in her satin-studded, white dress. Although she is taller than the groom, I doubt much improvement could have been made. Her face holds a broad smile, just like her betrothed. She also gets three hair options, looking dashing in each.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>Though not large, a lot of thought was obviously poured over this set. A short aisle has been attached at the front and sells the intended idea enough. Continuing around the perimeter of the model seems to reveal the location of this wedding to be a beach. Regardless, this set could be used for every wedding. The railings along the back add nicely to the model and leads right into the finely structured arch. This has lovely details all the way to the top. Here the ceremony comes to a climax with the classic, Lego-built heart. The lovebirds beneath can be rotated in any direction on their smooth turntables. Behind them, a wonderful cupcake rack has been placed and topped by two noble figs. A bouquet is present for the bride and a ring made for The Lord of the Rings is held by the groom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I built an addition to this model that extends to the sea, but that is not to say that I don&rsquo;t think this model is an ample build. I just thought this set was a good starting point for a glorious future.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>If I was getting married, I certainly would want this on my cake. The selection of hair pieces, a touching little build, and the combination of two people who love each other, you can&rsquo;t top that. Even if the marriage of two interests fails, you are still left with an awesome parts pack.</p>
