<p>Any way this figure retails for &pound;6 and is only at Hamley&rsquo;s&nbsp;stores in England, Scotland and Wales. It has 5 parts so the price per part is very high at &pound;1.20.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>4 of the pieces make up the figure. His hat part is the same as the series 5 royal guard figure from 2012 &nbsp; in a black color&nbsp;with no print. His face looks focused and his torso print is similar to the series 5 figure as it has a white belt but has additional print for some medals.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The other part is a black minifigure stand which has no print on it unfortunately.</p>

<p>______________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To finish off, i like this figure but it raises a question for me and that is why is this a thing it&rsquo;s weird and random also Hamley&rsquo;s isn&rsquo;t as big as people think in the UK it has very few stores nationwide.</p>

<p>Apart from that i would recommend this figure to anyone when they are cheaper but &pound;6 is a bit pricey for me.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Great printing throughout, Reuse of Series 5 hat part</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>Overpriced, Exclusivity, Horrid Price Per Part</p>
