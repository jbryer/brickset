<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>There is hardly much at all to build in this set.&nbsp; The minifigure is pretty standard obviously, and the small amount of parts used for the weapon rack are really all that&#39;s left.&nbsp; This set has some really nice pieces though, so I will give it that much respect.</p>

<h2>Minifigure</h2>

<p>The minifigure included in this battle pod is, of course, Cole.&nbsp; He is wearing the same black training outift that all of the ninja have had in these battle pods so far since 2018, and while collecting these could definitely feel boring and repetitive after a while, the prints on the torso are amazing, front and back.&nbsp; The legs are carried over from Cole&#39;s Spinjitzu Master figure, and fit very nicely with the torso, despite being a bit of a lazy add-in by LEGO.&nbsp; His face is the same that we get with most Cole minifgures now since the TLNM sets, with a smiling expression and an angry expression.&nbsp; The best part of all is his man bun!&nbsp; Despite this battle pod being marketed for Sons of Garmadon, in which Cole has his casual hairpiece instead, this figure still has the man bun from the TLNM wave, which actually only came in one set back then -&nbsp;<strong>Temple of the Ultimate Ultimate Weapon</strong>.&nbsp; For being a pretty rare piece, I&#39;m surprised LEGO included it here - and I&#39;m glad they did.&nbsp; Cole&#39;s weapon is his hammer, which is built identical to how it appears in the TLNM sets.&nbsp; He also has a pair of gold sais.</p>

<p>The pod also comes with a nice set of Kendo armor that you can put on Cole.&nbsp; The helmet is an exclusive color, with a brown outline around the faceguard.&nbsp; The armor is the same they use for all the Kendo pods - the 2013 Stone Warrior armor in gold.&nbsp; I really wish they had used the actual Kendo armor piece like with Lloyd and Kai&#39;s Kendo figures from TLNM, but this still looks cool.</p>

<h2>The Pod</h2>

<p>For being my first battle pod, this was actually not too bad.&nbsp; The pod itself is a nice orange color, and I LOVE getting stuff for Cole in orange, it really looks awesome for him.&nbsp; The images on the front alternate between a close-up of Cole&#39;s face with his ninja hood on, and his symbol that we see on his Spinjitzu Master spinner as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The inside of the pod is pretty basic - the left half of the pod has a skeleton dummy to wear Cole&#39;s Kendo armor.&nbsp; There are also clip pieces to hold Cole&#39;s weapons.</p>

<p>The other half has a printed background of what I can only assume is some kind of dojo or monastery, and there are studs on the bottom to display your Cole minifigure in front of the background.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall, this battle pod is pretty good - probably the best that have been produced so far for Ninjago - but it doesn&#39;t really change my opinion much on battle pods.&nbsp; They&#39;re still overpriced, whether they have nice pieces or not.&nbsp; If you can find this on sale like I did, I&#39;d say consider it.&nbsp; If not, I wouldn&#39;t buy it unless you really want it for some reason.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a lot like Zane&#39;s pod: small prices that could easily get lost if you&#39;re not careful, a small background in the back and a mannequin that has ribs for some reason and looks completely weird with the hair. I&#39;m not exactly sure how I feel about the Sai that came with it, mostly because we&#39;ve never seen Cole use something like that in the movie or the show (though that would be pretty cool), but it does come with the famed hammer.</p>

<p>The biggest reason I got this set was for two reasons: 1. Mobile play (is a bit limited with the way the set it, but it&#39;s nice to have Cole to carry around), and 2. The man bun. I ADORE the man bun.</p>

<p>All in all it&#39;s a cute little set to add to my Cole collection.</p>
