<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although DJ (stands for&nbsp;&quot;Don&#39;t Join&quot;)&nbsp;did not get very much screen time in TLJ, I still really liked his character, so I am glad to see him made into a minifigure.&nbsp;This is the 3rd LEGO Star Wars Polybag to come with both a figure and display stand. The previous two were R3-M2 and Scarif Stormtrooper, both which I thought were just meh. First of all I think the display stand looks very good. The backdrop is a printed piece of plastic while the DJ label is a&nbsp;1x4 sticker.&nbsp;Sadly though, once again, the figure itself&nbsp;is pretty bad. The print on the legs and torso look great. The face <em>almost</em> captures the look of Benicio Del Toro, but not quite. Unfortunately, there is only one expression. Having two would have been very&nbsp;appropriate considering what a double crosser DJ is in TLJ. The hair isn&#39;t even the right color!&nbsp;A new mold for the hair would have been great. He also includes no accessories. They easily could have at least included a gold coin, mini blaster, or even an exclusive 1x1 tile printed&nbsp;depicting Rose&#39;s necklace. But no. We just get a plain inaccurate figure with no arm or side of leg printing or a single accessory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So overall, I think they could have done a much better job with this figure. <em>At least</em> give him the right color hair and a double-sided face! If this figure had been in a normal set, say, the decapitated First Order AT-ST, I would not have too much to complain about. But the point is, with a retail price of $6, you should be getting a very high quality&nbsp;figure. Overall, I&#39;m still happy to add this figure to my collection and hope they continue with the display stands being included. Thankfully&nbsp;it looks like things are looking up for&nbsp;polybags as the Han Solo Mudtrooper and Kessel Mine Worker look pretty good. But I guess as long as it&#39;s not profitable for LEGO, they will just&nbsp;keep doing figures like this.&nbsp; &quot;It&#39;s j-just buisness.&quot;<em> -DJ </em></p>

<p>Comes in normal bag with small instructions. It also includes one sticker for the name plate.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The only cool part is the backdrop showing the ship that DJ, Finn, Rose, and BB-8 stole in Star Wars Episode 8 The Last Jedi. You also get a black stand as well. You get 1 sticker in this set as the name tag saying DJ. Other than that you don&#39;t get any special or unique pieces with this set. The total piece count for this set is 22.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This is a pretty bland minifigure (especially since it is one of these special stand figures). The lack of printing is pretty disappointing. You have&nbsp;printing on the front and back of his torso showing his jacket and part of a belt, which is pretty good. Other than that you don&#39;t have anything else.&nbsp;You have very minimal printing on his legs (which is brown on black so it is hard to see). There is no printing on the side of the legs or arms. He has single sided face (which is disappointing). The face is fairly accurate (In my opinion) and the expression isn&#39;t bad.&nbsp;It would have been nice if they gave something like a gold coin or a blaster or some sort of accessories, but all well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. There was nothing to it. Took me a minute or two to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall, Lego could have done a much better job on him. This figure is really disappointing with the lack of effort but forth. The printing on the torso is good, but that is the only printing on besides the legs (which is hard to see). A double-sided face with an accessory or weapon would have made this figure much better. Overall I do recommend getting him to add to your Star Wars minifigure collection as he is a good figure to own. There just really isn&#39;t anything special about this character though that makes him unique or stands out. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 3-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am very pleased with this little polybag and it makes a brilliant addition to my minifigure collection. I highly recommend to minifigure fanatics!</p>
