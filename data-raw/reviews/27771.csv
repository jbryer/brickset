<p>Packaging / Instructions<br />
As usual, we get a foil bag. It can be closed again and opened for as long as the glue will allow. There are no instructions, but you don&#39;t need them.</p>

<p>Minifigures<br />
Master Chen minifig is included in this set. Unfortunately it doesn&#39;t have a cloak, but it looks nice nonetheless.</p>

<p>Parts<br />
In addition to the minifigure, the set includes 4 good bricks: 2 snakes, green and red, and two silver claws.</p>

<p>Overall<br />
Great minifigure and parts for a great price. Looks great alone or on the balcony in the set 71735: Tournament of Elements.</p>
