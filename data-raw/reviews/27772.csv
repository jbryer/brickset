A regular minifig will stay in the throne.&nbsp; This set has a lot of stickers, including some reflective ones, which is interesting.&nbsp; Both of the carpets were a lot smaller then i was expecting.&nbsp; The instructions seem like their a bit incomplete, when you compare it to the pictures.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
