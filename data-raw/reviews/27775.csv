"p0dracer","2018-11-23T19:11:56.027Z","Fun but a little tiring toy ","<p>This is my third spinner purchase with the new ripcord play feature. Got the original airjitzu, the spinjitzu n this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Execution wise this is the most fun. It improves on the airjitzu by giving it forward flying action. However it takes a lot of practice to fly it nicely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s kinda hard to control the direction and has tendency to fly in a random style. And you need considerable strength to pull the ripcord. But when it flies nicely you will get a nice satisfaction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifig of Kai is awesome. New costume design is really nice and cool. Although I don&#39;t like the Lego Ninjago movie mask style. The drooping side near the eyes doesn&#39;t make it look cool compared to the previous Ninjago mask moulds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts wise it&#39;s just average. Nothing super special here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just got it for Kai and the fun flying gimmick toy. Will keep you entertained for short bursts.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-4eb89e53-7fff-1901-af57-db004a88cf52"">Lego had a pitch meeting. It probably went something like this, &ldquo;We have these old airjitzu spinners that are currently useless. We should add polyvinyl wings and call this new take something exciting like Dragon Masters.&rdquo; What we are left with feels underdeveloped.</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-4eb89e53-7fff-1901-af57-db004a88cf52"">The standard ripcord returns from the original design, but I think that was the best option. Sadly, the easily bendable wings obstruct the slot for the ripcord upon every use. They could certainly have enhanced this system, instead of limiting dexterity.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-4eb89e53-7fff-1901-af57-db004a88cf52"">The handle is more complex than I expected. Unfortunately, something just feels off about the grip. The combination of angles detracts from the ideal format. As for the main flyer component, it is just as lackluster as the aforementioned shaft. Launching this contraption doesn&rsquo;t completely inspire. However, the redeeming ability to do more intricate moves does merit a fresh look. I particularly like turning the vessel upside down and shooting the flyer into a unique aerial roll.</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-4eb89e53-7fff-1901-af57-db004a88cf52"">The minifigure is breathtaking from every angle. Kai only wears this garb here. Rugged pants with adequate padding are certainly becoming of Kai. Furthermore, his torso is profoundly detailed with a nifty pattern, safety harness, and dark red, ripped scarf. Though not much can be said for the head and mask, I would not change this aspect. His outfit emphasizes a traditional aviator&rsquo;s outfit and is a lovely choice. TLG has not included any accessories except for some shurikens which hold no significance.</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-4eb89e53-7fff-1901-af57-db004a88cf52"">I wish this set had a little more to offer. Several improvements could have been made. I actually found myself strictly liking the absolutely superb minifigure. A minifigure collector may wish for no more, but most will see this set as gone with the wind.</b></p>
