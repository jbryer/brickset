This plane is built from the remains the the 2<sup>nd</sup></span></span><span style=""font-size:11.0000pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri""> Destiny&rsquo;s Bounty. When I first saw the pictures I didn&rsquo;t particularly like the set as it looked as if the wings didn&rsquo;t merge seamlessly with the rest of the plane, but when I saw the finished model I liked it more. </span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11.0000pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri"">The Minifigures&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11.0000pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri"">Kai: this version of Kai uses the Ninjago movie style of hood, which looks fantastic. The top half is dual moulded in black and red, and the bottom part is plain black. The face print is the same one used in the Ninjago movie showing a happy expression on one side and a concentrating one on the other. His torso print looks great featuring chain mail over half it of it and detailed robes on the other. I love the metallic silver highlights. His robes are torn, exposing his left arm. His legs continue the fantastic detailing and the chain mail continues down his leg. He comes with two Katanas.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11.0000pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri"">Jet Jack: Jet Jack&rsquo;s jet pack (now say that 10 times quickly) is a simple but effective build; I especially appreciate the olive green parts on it. Her black Mohawk sets her apart from her allies. She has a metallic silver visor print which looks amazing. The rest of her face print looks good too. Her torso and legs feel a bit plain; they show a flight suit with metallic highlights. She holds a spear.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11.0000pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri"">The Side Build&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11.0000pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri"">This set includes a small stand for the Dragonbone blade. The sword is one of my favourite parts of the set and is made up of two pieces. The blade its self is dual moulded in tan and metallic silver, but the hilt is the best part for me, it&rsquo;s made of gold and shows a dragon head. When I first saw this piece I immediately envisaged it being used for custom Nun-chucks of Lightning, and sure enough the next series of Ninjago sets used it as such. The side build also has a couple of dark tan wings and an olive green leaf piece. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11.0000pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri"">The Set&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11.0000pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri"">The front of this vehicle features a spinning propeller, which makes for an interesting look. The engine continues with silver exhaust pipes down the side. The canopy piece works well covering most of the the gaps. It opens easily and has plenty of space for a figure. The gold backrest looks nice and a single printed piece makes up the control display. A pair of gold exhaust pipes, two wings with a dragon sticker on either side, a white flag, and two re-purposed grey barrels for jet engines complete the rear of the model. The wings curve out smoothly from the body via a relatively new 4x4 quarter circle piece. I am pleased with that effect as in the pictures the wings felt as though they were disconnected from the body. Clips on either wing let you store Kai&rsquo;s Katanas when not in use which is a great feature lacking in many sets. Stud shooters on top of the wings and spring loaded shooters underneath the wings make up the planes fire-power. Both of these weapons add playability without compromising the looks. A few newish, gold 2x2 quarter circle pieces detail the wings. </span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-size:11.0000pt""><span style=""font-family:Calibri"">This set retails for $30 aud and comes with 181 pieces. The price to part ratio is average, but the value for money is great. This set is fun to play with, pretty good on display, and comes with decent parts. My only concern is the set isn&rsquo;t very distinctive; there are plenty of Lego planes even within the Ninjago theme and this one doesn&rsquo;t stand out. I would recommend this set for the price, but its not a must have. </span></span></p>
