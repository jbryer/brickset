<p>The top-set in the &#39;Hunted&#39; line of 2018 Ninjago sets is<strong> the Dragon Pit (set 70655)</strong>, and IMHO it lives up to that status. The set is big, has many minifigures, a nice dragon,&nbsp;many play-features and simply looks very good, almost part of an amphitheatre. The build itself is fun, and&nbsp;quite varied. IMHO it compares well with some of the other big &#39;top of a theme&#39; play-sets, like <strong>Jungle Air Drop Helicopter (set 60162)</strong>. I would also argue that the price is quite reasonable for what you get - though admittedly it is a lot of money.</p>

<h2>Building experience</h2>

<p>Overall, it took me about 3 hours to finish this set. There are quite a few stickers, but they are easy to apply, and IMHO definitely add to its looks. The recommended age for this set is given as 9-16. Frankly, I do not see why the age range is as high as it is. The only thing I can think of is that many younger children might get bored building this set in one go.</p>

<p>Nice are the print on the shield (also found in <strong>Dieselnaut (set 70654)</strong>)and the eye-prints for the dragon. The dragon itself is IMHO an OK build. Of the four dragons in this wave - in the <strong>Dragon Hunter</strong> polybag <strong>(set 30547)</strong>, <strong>Stormbringer (set 70652)</strong>, <strong>Firstbourne (set 70653)</strong>, and this one - I enjoyed this build the least. The head is a nice design though.</p>

<p>Next up is the construction of the main gate. First the two side-walls are built, then the decoration and the first floor. Thankfully few off-colour pieces (bright blue, bright yellow) are used, and they are mostly hidden away quite nicely. Many of the Technic elements used are also nicely hidden away. The mechanism to open the gates is not the most elegant, but because of that looks much better.</p>

<p>Construction of this is followed by building the side buildings, starting with the blacksmith and look-out tower. Again, construction techniques used are fairly simple, but used to great effect. I like the use of a central column to provide extra stability for the roof and the flick-fire dart-and-chain shooter. I like how the designer had managed to leave so much space on the platforms, and still provide quite a strong structure.&nbsp;The final element to be built is the dungeon-tower. A very simple construction, but even in this, there is a nice play-feature integrated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I dis not really come across construction techniques that wowed me. Some techniques seem to be borrowed (and slightly adapted) from other (big) sets, like&nbsp;the <strong>Temple of Airjitzu&nbsp;(set 70751)</strong>&nbsp;(for the roofs)</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>This set has 9 (!) minifigures, 5 good guys, and 4 bad guys. In sheer number, that is only surpassed by <strong>Ninjago City (set 70620)</strong>&nbsp;- which has 19 minifigures&nbsp;- the aformentioned Temple of Airjitzu -&nbsp;which has 13, one of them&nbsp;a statue - &nbsp;and is equal to the amount of minifigures in&nbsp;the <strong>City of Stiix&nbsp;(set 70732)</strong> and <strong>Final Flight of Destiny&#39;s Bounty (set 70738)</strong>. Moreover, 4 of the minifigures are unique to this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of the bad guys, Heavy Metal, Chew Toy and the Iron Baron can be found in other sets, while Arkade is actually unique. For all of them, the print looks very good. I like Arkade&#39;s&nbsp;torso print the best.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of the Wu Cru, only Nya is missing. All the others are included in this set. t is clear that the Ninjas have suffered along the way to different degrees, from no damage (Zane) to seriously mauled (Cole), as the latter&#39;s torso armour is only held up by a strap across his body. Again, all prints are very well done, and highly detailed.</p>

<p>The star figure of this set is the Dragon Master (Sensei Wu), fitted out in a complete set of Dragon Armour, all in gold. The base colour of this minifigure&nbsp;is gold as well, with traditional (older style) samurai armour&nbsp;in white. It is highly detailed and looks beautiful. Very well done by Lego and its designers. The various armour pieces (the shoulder army, the sword, the shield and the helmet) can be found individually in other sets; Dieselnaut&nbsp;has a complete set of armour, but not the minifigure.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The dragon is a non-flying dragon, or a flagging dragon with its wings clipped. As with the other big dragons in the &#39;Hunted&#39; wave, it has a brick built head with printed eyes. I am OK with the colour scheme of greys and sand green. It is a nice contrast with the brown tones of the arena buildings. I also like the use of the two blades along the jaws. The general build is quite stocky, with a club-like tail.&nbsp;The wings are IMHO so-so. Personally, I prefer the general looks of the Earth Dragon in <strong>Earth Dragon Defense (set 2509)</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The central part of the arena, with the gate is well designed. First, the dragon can actually come through the gate - it fits with some space to spare. I like the design of the gate elements itself. Somewhat dillapidated, with the spikes, it fits the overall looks of the &#39;Hunted&#39; theme very well. The star element of the set, IMHO, is the dragon skull throne of the Iron Baron. It is simply beautiful and was truly fun to build.</p>

<p>The design of the blacksmith&#39;s workshop is simple but effective, though somewhat cramped. I also like how the forge&nbsp;is another variation on the theme, being different from the one in the Temple of Airjitzu&nbsp;or the <strong>Dragon&#39;s Forge (set 70627)</strong>. The telescope on the first floor looks good, and the dart-and-chain shooter looks like a proper bodge job, consistent with the other bad guy vehicles in this wave.The cage with trap-door and exit into the arena section is a really simple build, but with the extra details it looks much more impressive than the simple build actually merits.</p>

<p>Overall, the whole set looks good, and suitably crazy and over the top for a Ninjago set, and for this team. Especially the use of the teeth-like elements (or blades) works well. The stickers also enhance the looks of the arena. Overall you get the impression of a somewhat dilapidated arena in a far off corner of the world, with all kinds of damage from the fights patched up. It somewhat reminds me of the North African arena in which Maximus has his first fights in the movie Gladiator. I like the use of various tints of tan, preventing the set from becoming bland. So does the interplay between studless&nbsp;and studded surfaces.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>This set is designed as a play set, and as such works well. A nice dragon, smoothly working doors through which the dragon can enter the arena, numerous accessories, many bad guys to fight, the blacksmith&#39;s workshop, the dart-and-chain, the trapdoor-with escape into the arena. The various elements of the structure (gates, blacksmith&#39;s tower, prison block) can be connected in different ways, and moved around. Just as important, the structures have sufficient depth to pose numerous minifigures.</p>

<p>As a display set, this works out quite well. It is big, with many interesting details to look at. One could also use this set as a basis for a much bigger arena. The dragon is OK, but due to its colour&nbsp;and design not as striking as Firstbourne&nbsp;or Stormbringer.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, this is IMHO a superb set. I am not sure it offers as much value for money as Stormbringer&nbsp;does, but this set definitely lives up to its position as the top&nbsp;set of the Ninjago&nbsp;&#39;Hunted&#39; series of sets, and actually as&nbsp;the top set of all 2018 regular Ninjago sets (<strong>Ninjago&nbsp;City Docks, set 70675</strong>,&nbsp;is a Ninjago&nbsp;Movie Set, and also not a fair comparison)&nbsp;.&nbsp;I feel that by and large Ninjago&nbsp;sets have a high standard - well designed, nice play features, good value for money - and this one definitely lives up to that standard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, its price is good. It is a shame that a high quality set like this is out of reach for many people. So I hope that as many people as possible will be able to find this set on a discount, and be able to get it that way.</p>

"BrickBuiltBill","2019-04-24T13:55:16.167Z","""Kita no Jutsu"", which roughly translates to ""Awesome techniques!""","<p>Although many of the parts will definitely come in handy for MOCs&nbsp;(lookin&#39; at you, 40-tooth gear...), I&#39;m actually kind of reluctant to take this set&nbsp;apart. Over the course of building it, I was amazed at how much&nbsp;detail went into such&nbsp;aspects as the roof, with its texturing courtesy of the slope pieces, as well as the little engine build to give an illusion of locomotion. And there&#39;s another thing: the action features. I knew in advance of my purchase that there would be relatively few play functions, but that&#39;s not necessarily a bad thing; too many action features tends to bog down the overall set. I think the gate definitely impressed me the most out of all the functions; the way they open in unison is so cool! The minifigure selection was good as well; I know many collectors will be after the exclusive Dragon Master and Arkade figures. I had a lot of fun building this, and I must admit I&#39;ve kind of grown attached to it.</p>

"BelgianBricker","2020-02-08T13:57:01.347Z","Balanced perfection","<p>Ninjago has been growing on me. It has become one of my favourite LEGO-themes. It&nbsp;always managed to surprise and please me. I don&#39;t really care for the vehicles, but the builds and structures are always well-made, interesting, filled with detail and accessories&nbsp;and fun play features.</p>

<p>I had to pick this one up. It had&nbsp;been staring at me online and in stores for months and now that I bought this bad-ass of a set, I am pleased that I did.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build isn&#39;t overly complex or difficult. It is mostly a continuous fluent movement of brickstacking with a once-in-a-while small technic assembly.<br />
<br />
We&nbsp;start off&nbsp;with building the stone-dragon. This build is nicely compact, with lots of small parts that add detailing and shaping to the final model. I love the way this dragon looks:&nbsp;the colours, shaping, sturdiness,...etc...it all adds to the experience and visual admiration of this lovely animal. I even like the minimalistic &quot;wings&quot; on this little guy/girl. It suits him/her well. I can&nbsp;especially appreciate&nbsp;the shaping and build of his back - with the nice seating area surrounded with vicious looking spikes - and the end of his tail, that remind me of the tail of a euoplocephalus.<br />
The colour-scheme is perfect, with a nice mix of light grey, black and sand-green highlights. Many reviewers have made complaints about the swords on the side of the head. I understand these remarks, although for me it is more the colour that is off. The sword itself lends itself perfect for the job: it looks like it is cut out of stone, so that works. It should have had, however, a sand green colour instead of tan: it would have made it blend in better with the rest of the dragon.</p>

<p>After finishing the dragon we build the arena. First we construct the front gate after which we build the two side-builds.<br />
Building the front gate is a little bit boring because of the symmetry&nbsp;of the structure. The final result, however, looks stunning. The mechanism to open the doors is completely in your face: the technic gears are very visible. It looks great and fits the build perfectly, adding to the industrial look and feel of this set.&nbsp;Some weird colours (bright yellow and blue) are shining through. I don&#39;t really mind&nbsp;(and that says a lot, coming from someone who hates weird colours in visible places :D). The opening-door mechanism works perfectly and smoothly (if you set the doors and gears right during the build). My 3-yo son played with it for about 1 hour, non-stop opening and closing the doors :D - he is already hooked-for-life!<br />
The absolute star off this centerbuild is the dragonhead-throne. WOW!! STUNNING!! Absolutely brilliant and a very nice build. Unfortunately it isn&#39;t very easy to get the baron in and out of his throne.<br />
Important side note: the dragon CAN fit through the gate! Good job LEGO. Extra points here :)</p>

<p>The two side-builds are OK. I like the smithy/look-out structure better than the jail. The jail is too much jail. It would have been better if&nbsp;the upper level would have been something different, another function or place or&nbsp;room. The action feature here, again, works great.&nbsp;<br />
The smithy is nice, but a little bit cramped. Leaving out the weapon crate or anvil is needed for play. The upper deck uses a sturdy yet completely unnecessary technic fortification. I understand that LEGO thought it was needed to add support, but it only uses up space and hinders playability and the placement of figures. I left it out and it still works fine.</p>

<p>The different structures can be connected with technic pins. This also means that the configuration can be switched or that the different parts can be place separate&nbsp;from each other. It is a great way to enhance playability and it is a feature that LEGO has used over and over. Please LEGO: never stop using this feature, it is perfect!!</p>

<p>So any more to say about the set Yes: lots of details - and I mean LOTS - all over the place. There is even so much detail I am sometimes overwhelmed by it: spikes, round 1x1 plates, bones, more spikes and more bones LOL...<br />
Stickers? Yes, but not to many. Most of them can be left out without any problem The only stickers I found necessary are: the sticker on the baron&#39;s staff, the stickers on Wu&#39;s flag, the 2 dragon stickers on the walls of the smithy. The stickers with wood pattern and scratch pattern don&#39;t add a lot to the build. They can be used for extra texture, but it doesn&#39;t hurt the final build if you leave them off.<br />
Prints? Yes, and&nbsp;some very nice ones: a beautiful print on Wu&#39;s shield, an even beautiful print on the Iron Barons emblem on top of his throne room. And I am pleased to say that also the dragon&#39;s eyes are printed - WITH A DIFFERENT PRINT ON BOTH SIDES OF THE HEAD! GREAT!!</p>

<p>The figures are nice, and we get an even balance of good guys and bad guys. Decked out Wu looks quite amazing, as does the Iron Baron. Chew toy gives a humorous accent and Arkade is the mandatory&nbsp;unique fig. All prints are up to par. Good job.</p>

<p>Overall I feel that, if this set is anything, that it is balanced:&nbsp;</p>

<p>-There is balance in the figures<br />
-There is balance between display and play<br />
-There is balance between stickers and prints<br />
-There is balance in shape, form and colour<br />
-There is, simply said, balanced perfection.</p>

<p>And that is what makes this set a 5/5:&nbsp;it&#39;s balanced perfection.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
