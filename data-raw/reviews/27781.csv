<p>And there are some really nice parts in there, to name a few:</p>

<ul>

	<li><a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6218089/tile-2x2-w-bow"">Tile 2X2, W/ Bow</a>, only in this and Yoda&#39;s hut&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>And the villian minifigs are really cool. It also contains the&nbsp;complete &#39;dragon&#39; armour, on a stand/statue.The thing runs on three axles with wheels/threads of different sizes, not easy to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But it really fails in the logic/functions department:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The front bumper can push in a little, which I suppose is useful&nbsp;for ramming other things.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>There are two spring-loaded shooters.</li>
	<li>The shooting platform on top can be rotated with a knob&nbsp;on the side.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A crane of sorts to one side.</li>
	<li>A detachable container on the end. Its function is not completely clear. Possibly to transport the stand with the armour, or as a prison. But I&#39;m sure kids can figure this out.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>A storage area that contains a foldable weapon stand. It however looks like a wall/ground&nbsp;mounted affair, and it makes no sense to me it is transported in the rear of the machine.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>An opening cockpit on the front. But with it closed, the minifig inside seems to have no way to see outside. To open it sufficiently, you&nbsp;dislocate&nbsp;the floodlights that are behind it.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The weirdest of all is the opening compartment in the middle. It is shown on the back&nbsp;as a place that&nbsp;two henchmen can jump out of. However, when closed/assembled&nbsp;it has six spikes in its interior, making it look kind-of like an iron maiden, and there is no space for a minifig&nbsp;inside. Even when putting the spikes on the&nbsp;outside, you can barely fit one. Perhaps the cartoon will show what its intent is. A trap/grip for dragons?&nbsp;Expanded, it kind of looks like battlements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is also a lot of unused space in the lower part of the vehicle, which is a shame. And despite that, it has very little ground clearance due to the &#39;lump&#39;&nbsp;between the rear two axles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fact that it has no suspension/hinging means this thing will utterly fail on any bumpy surface. Of which there is a lot, in most deserts.</p>

<p>What I would have liked/expected is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>For the front (threaded) section to separate&nbsp;off, perhaps with rear transforming in some way.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Suspension, steering&nbsp;or some other functions/compartments that make use of all that empty/inaccessible space in the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Conclusion: not a bad set, but it is a bit lacking if you compare it to for instance the absolutely brilliant&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70917-1/The-Ultimate-Batmobile"">Ultimate Batmobile</a>.</p>

"Riverwind","2018-06-26T18:19:50.207Z","Mean machine","<p>I was really anticipating this set, and got it when it was released. And now I&#39;m going to review it, highlighting its strong and weak sides. Please note&nbsp;that I don&#39;t know the Ninjago story and characters, so I&#39;m just telling my impressions about the set and minifigures.</p>

<h2><strong>The minifigures</strong></h2>

<p>The minifigs&nbsp;are quite good, with nicely detailed weapons and prints. The good ninjas get their swords, a bow and some... blade on a chain. Not like these weapons are very effective against that monster vehicle, but if the ninjas, somehow, could board it, or sneak inside while it&#39;s parked... Then they have a chance to defeat the Dieselnaut crew and take over the controls.</p>

<p>As usual, I like the bad guys more. They have one specialist soldier with a crossbow (it has a chain, probably to pull its target), and two regular crewmen. The&nbsp;Dieselnaut commander minifig is my favorite in this set, with his artifical&nbsp;leg and arm, which is some sort of &quot;power-arm&quot; I think, because it has a small pressure indicator. The commander also wears a fancy top hat and uses a staff.</p>

<h2><strong>The parts</strong></h2>

<p>I&#39;ve got several new parts for me with this set. Found it funny that we get a lot of &quot;tooth&quot; parts, I think it is great addition to make the set more detailed.&nbsp;The set also includes some Technic pieces, as well.</p>

<h2><strong>The build</strong></h2>

<p>We build the&nbsp;Dieselnaut&nbsp;exactly the same way as we build practically every other ground vehicle - from bottom to top. There aren&#39;t any special techniques, it&#39;s all pretty straightforward. Also no any notable Technic building, except maybe a very simple rotating mechanism for the turret. We do have the tracks, the bumper, the crane, the lifting holder for a prison cell, some other parts of the vehicle where we use Technic pieces,&nbsp;but it&#39;s hardly a complex Technic assembling.</p>

<h2><strong>The completed model &amp; playability</strong></h2>

<p>When we finish assembling, we can behold the&nbsp;Dieselnaut, to be honest, it really looks very cool and menacing. It is detailed with teeth pieces, which make it look truly barbaric. The postapocalyptic&nbsp;color scheme of orange and darkish &quot;swamp&quot; green brings thoughts of toxic radioactive fields. But, having a lot of stickers to apply, I must say, the&nbsp;Dieselnaut looks less impressive if you prefer not to put the stickers. However, we have one nicely printed round plate on the side.</p>

<p>The first thing you are going to do with the built set... Roll it around, of course! Oh, well, there&#39;s a disappointment. The tracks don&#39;t roll very good, even with their rubber studs, which you put on them. Also, the&nbsp;Dieselnaut&nbsp;doesn&#39;t have any turning mechanism, which is a shame, IMO. I would prefer something like a joint between the track section and the wheel section.</p>

<p>The bumper actually has its own purpose, to absorb crash damage! It moves back and forward a bit, and there is a couple of rubber pieces inside, which mitigate the hits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the front of the&nbsp;Dieselnaut it has a... control room, or an engine room, I&#39;m not sure, what it is, because there&#39;s actually no any controls inside. But, it&#39;s intended that we put a minifig&nbsp;there, behind a cooler fan under the black canopy. There&#39;s no way they can see from inside of it, so I prefer to think its some kind of an engine room for repairs.</p>

<p>Behind the front canopy two lights illuminate our path, or they can be turned around&nbsp; to help find sneaky ninjas at night.</p>

<p>The next section, in the middle, can be opened to sides, showing a storage room. There&#39;s nothing in here, but I you can put the golden armor stand there, and it will fit nicely. Doing so is also like displaying a trophy, look, we captured the armor, now we&#39;re going to ride around showing it off! If you want to put a minifig&nbsp;or something else inside that storage room, and close the covers, don&#39;t forget to turn the rotating teeth up. Otherwise, they&#39;re hidden inside, blocking the room space.</p>

<p>Next we have the best section, the tower turret. It can be rotated 360 degrees by turning a gear on the side. Very cool feature. The printed plate rotates with it too. Our commander can shoot the spring shooter, mounted on the turret. It&#39;s built to look like a ballista.</p>

<p>At the rear section there are more great features - a prison cell with opening side doors. It can be moved up and down, and be easily detached. These claws,&nbsp;that pierce through the net, will really make anyone,&nbsp;who is unfortunate to be held in the cell, very nervous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If we detach the prison cell, we can pull out a weapon storage, which is hidden under the turret. It has a handful of additional weapons for minifigs.</p>

<p>At the right side we have a very simple crane with a moving claw. You can rotate it, and pull the claw with a chain. This crane is quite unimpressive, I think it should be more detailed and functional. If you catch something with the crane, you can only carry it in the claw. You can&#39;t lift your loot and put it in the storage room in the center. I think it&#39;s not good.</p>

<p>On the other side of the vehicle, another small turret with a spring shooter is located. It turns right and left nicely, but lifting it up is problematic - it falls off easily, and also they put that 1x2 brick under it, which does nothing but obstructs the turret lifting. I suggest replacing it with a flat one. By the way, there&#39;s the same problem with the main upper turret too.</p>

<h2><strong>Overall</strong></h2>

<p>This is impressive looking vehicle, and I recommend it if you like postapocalyptic&nbsp;themed sets. Despite of having a few flaws, it is a good set, and I think it worth the money. Its play features are not perfect, but it is okay.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-12-02T17:36:24.173Z","Suitably Ninjago crazy ","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>When the &#39;Hunted&#39; wave of Ninjago sets came out over the summer, I was not sure what to make of the&nbsp;Dieselnaut. But then again, with <strong>Firstbourne (set 70653)</strong> came a similarly styled helicopter, which I liked a lot. Having built Dieselnaut, I am not disappointed in this set; it looks much better in real life than in the images or on the box. A massive Ninjago-style crazy vehicle, a good number of minifigures, a nice colour scheme, there is little not to like. My biggest complaints would be that it will be difficult to place all four bad guys on or in the vehicle, and that the tracks do not work well on smooth surfaces.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is a good set, worthy of consideration. I also think the price is reasonable. Is it the best set in the &#39;Hunted&#39; series? I would argue not, IMHO Firstbourne is a better set. That said, if you can find this set on a good discount, getting this one or Firstbourne would be a tough choice to make, and personal preference will be the desider.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The almost 1200 pieces in this set are are divided over 9 bags, and good for some 3 hours of building fun. There are apparently a few rare pieces included in this kit, as reported in some of the other reviews. I really like the single printed disk. There are some stickers to apply. Their application is not difficult, but care must be taken as they are large, and highly visible. Any tilt would be immediately visible.</p>

<p>First the Dragon Armour stand is built, together with the weapons storage. The final eight bags are used to build the vehicle and fit it out properly. It starts out with the construction of a Technic Base., and from there it is built up in sections. There are one or two moments where one has to pay attention, and where putting in the pieces might get tricky. There were no construction techniques used that truly WOW-ed me, but the designer has done a very good job lining up the various sections and elements. The set is intended for children 9 years old and&nbsp;older. I think many younger children should be able to build this set, though they might lack the patience to build it in one or two sittings.</p>

<p>I like the way the designer has handled the canopy to the cockpit. The prison/cage is a fun little mini-build.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are seven minifigures in this set:&nbsp;3 good guys, and 4 villains. Only two of the minifigures are unique: Teen Wu and Skullbreaker. Iron Baron is not unique, but is only otherwise found in the considerably more expensive <strong>Dragon Pit (set 70655)</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jay is found not only in the Dragon Pit set, but also in <strong>Stormbringer (set 70652)</strong>. His torso print is very detailed, and lovely. The silvery highlights stand out in particular. His leg print is nice, showing a damaged leg.</p>

<p>Zane is found in the same sets as Jay: the Dragon Pit and Stormbringer. His leg print is quite good, but seemingly less detailed. Personally I prefer Jay&#39;s print. The torso print is continued nicely onto the leg print.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Teen Wu is unique to this set. Based on his face print he is in his late teens, as he has some stubble. I like his two different face prints, one serious, another smiling. His hair piece is brilliant, almost hippie-like. His torso print, portraying heavily damaged clothing and other gear, is very nice and well done. He has no print on his legs.</p>

<p>Heavy Metal is found in three sets, Firstbourne, Dieselnaut and this one. This figure is well done, and I like the spear-gun he carries.</p>

<p>Muzzle is found also found in the&nbsp;Stormbringer&nbsp;and Firstbourne&nbsp;sets. His body and torso is identical to that of Heavy Metal and Skullbreaker. The difference is in the head gear.</p>

<p>Skullbreaker is unique to this set. I like his head gear.</p>

<p>Iron Baron is arguably the best figure in this set. I like the composit nature of this minifigure: iron peg as a leg, nice face print, tall hat, nice detailed torso print representing ratty clothes, and his shoulder armour. He is armed with a knife, a claw-hand and a staff.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Dieselnaut is quite massive, and quite sturdy. The stickers definitely add to the looks of the whole thing. The Technic elements are by and large hidden away nicely. The bumper shock-absorbtion-mechanism is cleverly hidden away, and works well. I also like the colour-scheme, nicely post-apocalyptic. It also looks as if this is a colour scheme that would provide a surprisingly good camouflage in a rocky, dry environment.</p>

<p>Dieselnaut clearly has taken some damage from dragons it was about to be captured.&nbsp; The cockpit cover is nice well done, as is the prison-cage that can be carried around nicely. I also like the way the weapons storage can be stowed away. I am not sure what the central compartment with the folding walls is about. All of this is topped by a spring-loaded shooter. Overall, the vehicle seems to be quite heavily armoured with spikes and such, and armed with a few springloaded shooters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The designer has done a great job combining the two different sized tyres and the track. The engine is covered nicely, to the point where you hardly see them at all. Although there are a lot of parts sticking out (spikes mostly), it is remarkably hard to get them to fall of the vehicle. The designer has also ensured&nbsp;that what few off-colour&nbsp;pieces are used during construction are covered up very nicely.</p>

<p>That said, there might be some room for improvement. The cockpit is lacking in control-equipment used to operate Dieselnaut. Some might also try to modify Dieselnaut into an articulated vehicle.</p>

<h2>Plav&nbsp;vs Display</h2>

<p>This set could serve as both a play and a display set. It is striking enough to be one. The vehicle is quite easy to handle. It is a shame the tracks do not work properly on a smooth surface. There are various play elements - the bumber, the crane, the sprin-loaded shooters, the cage and the weapons-storage. Men can also be put in the cockpit and the covered and spiked room. I can imagine one pursuing Firstbourne or Stormbringer&nbsp;with this vehicle. It would be a fascinating fight.</p>

<p>Dieselnaut would also make an impressive piece of display, as a stand-alone or part of a small diorama. It is well finished enough and, fully loaded up, has no truly ugly sides that need to be hidden from view.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, this is IMHO a good set, though not the best set in the &#39;Hunted&#39;-wave of sets and one of the better Ninjago sets of the year.&nbsp;That honour&nbsp;goes IMHO to <strong>Firstbourne&nbsp;(set 70653)</strong>. It is well designed, has a very nice selection of minifigures, has a striking and IMHO attractive colour-scheme, and quite a few play features. I think the price of the set is all right; and if you like Ninjago and see this set on a discount, there is IMHO little reason not to get this set.</p>

"BengalsBrix","2022-02-06T01:33:30.04Z","one of my favorites EVER","<p>1: the figures are amazing, the teen wu is the prize of the set appearing only elsewhere in a only bag and the others like Iron Baron and heavy metal are stellar, skullbreaker is pretty cool and the rest (muzzle and zone and jay are 10/10&#39;s as well)</p>

<p>2: let&#39;s be honest if you&#39;re paying the 100+ minimum on this set its largely for the build... and it won&#39;t disappoint, i mainly go for the dc and marvel lines as well as an occasional star war or H.P set, rarely ninjago, BUT for this i bought for two reasons 1, I liked hunted and 2- I&#39;ll be honest i like Batman&nbsp;a lot, and wanted a Heavy duty &quot;Battank&quot; I&#39;m &quot;converting it&quot; IT LOOKS AWESOME, i paid 75 USD for this and am not in the slightest disappointed! Would recommend if you can afford or were considering it previously...&nbsp;</p>

<p>3: THE VERDICT... Purchase I think it&#39;s amazing, has lots of play features and very customizable and enjoy it very much upon my dc and batman collection..</p>
