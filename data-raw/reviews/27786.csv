What I didn&#39;t expect was the Fantastic Beasts and where to Find Them, but that is not important. Let&#39;s get to the point of this review.</p>

<p>PARTS</p>

<p>The parts in this set are very unusual. I would say the most uncommon is the distinctive glasses piece, which appears only in this set, and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/41597-1/Go-Brick-Me"">41597: Go Brick Me</a>. The hairstyle is pretty cool, as is the printed scarf with the colors of Gryffindor symbolized on the piece. Like most LEGO sets, the inside of the minifigure&nbsp;has unusually colored pieces to build the structure inside the minifigure.&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""http://lego.brickinstructions.com/41000/41615/034.jpg"" style=""width: 250px; height: 172px;"" />&nbsp;As you can see in the instructions shown here, if you take apart the head, there is a wide variety of multicolored pieces used to hold the model together.</p>

<p>PLAYABILITY</p>

<p>Although almost all Harry Potter sets have at least one play feature, this has none, apart from Hedwig&#39;s ability to move her wings. It is however, a great model to have on display.</p>

<p>BUILDING EXPERIENCE</p>

<p>I enjoy building LEGO models more than playing with them, mostly because of the great size of some of them, including the two times I got the new <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70909-1/Batcave-Break-In"">LEGO Batcave</a>.</p>

<p>The Brickheadz theme is amazing to build, and includes incredible detail for brick-built figures. I only have this set, and the Flash Brickhead, but both are pretty cool.</p>

<p>SUMMARY</p>

<p>Harry Potter is a boy with his owl. And I am a boy with my LEGOs. In all, this is an amazing set worth buying and worth becoming a LEGO Wizard for!</p>
