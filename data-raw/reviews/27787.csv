Fortunately I was mistaken and this ended up being a pretty solid, though not perfect, Brickhead.</p>

<p>The build was not too entertaining, though is was not too boring. The best pieces are the printed pieces included. One thing that I have&nbsp;a problem with is the eyes. They blend into the head too much and needed some sort of print on them such as a dark red print on a black 1x1 round tile or some sort of indication of reflection off the lenses of the mask.</p>

<p>I really like the style of this Brickhead. The oversized head makes him look really cartoony in a good way. It is adorable, yet still captures the menacing look of the Vader we all know and love. It would of been cool if they had hidden a Anakin face underneath the Vader mask somehow, but I think that I am asking for too much with that. The lightsaber is a little small compared to the Brickhead, but it fits the style and looks good.</p>

<p>Overall this is a fun addition to an LEGO Star Wars collection. It is cute, yet menacing and it makes for a good display piece. This would look great alongside two or more of the 41620 Stormtrooper Brickheadz&nbsp;as well as standing alone. I recommend this to any Star Wars fan who likes cartoony versions of their favorite Star Wars characters.</p>

"vikings","2019-01-05T03:21:08.12Z","Awesome Brickhead","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Comes in the small Brickhead box. The instructions the normal small size ones that you get with them.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with some good parts. The triangle piece on Vader&#39;s mask is really nice. All the the printed pieces are really nice. The total piece count for the set is 104</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The build took me under 10 minutes to build. Was easy, the only thing different from the traditional brickhead is how they did Vader&#39;s cape which is really cool.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great brickhead. This one of my favorite brickheads&nbsp;yet. The new triangle piece on Vader&#39;s mask is nice, along with all the other printed pieces. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-11-07T12:40:02.36Z","The Dark Lord","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #41619 Darth Vader:</b> Slowly we are running out of BrickHeadz to discuss, alas I could not claim all the existing Retail sets before they started to vanish. But I did get this awesome Dark Lord of the Sith and now I shall discuss it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: In keeping with the packaging design for this year, Vader comes in a box which is base white in colour, red highlights are used and we get to see the character in Brick form on the front and artwork of the actual character on the side. The rest of the packaging is standard BrickHeadz design, a very nice compact box.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: The manual is folded in half, that&rsquo;s pretty much my go-to-complaint with these booklets. As it does tend to make it irritating to keep the manual open while I&rsquo;m working to get through the build, other than that no real problems, the pages show step-by-step the build very accurately and there&rsquo;s always some nice promo images in the back for BrickHeadz in general.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">If you like Black you are going to find it in abundance here. We&rsquo;ve got black bricks, black tiles, black slopes and wedges and everything else you&rsquo;d care to name. The only thing not black is most of the interior bricks, the 2x4 headlight bricks for the main body of the BrickHead will remain medium grey it would seem. You also get some printed elements for Vader&rsquo;s torso design. As is typical a perfect parts pack for a good price.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Always satisfying, never dull, the build for this set is great fun and a treat to complete. The back of the model uses a lot of interesting ideas to make a cape for the Sith lord and the helmet is a wondrous blocky design complete with curves to give the correct profile. This build is just all around a fun little treat for any fans of the character.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Vader stands menacingly at two centimeters tall, if I&rsquo;m remembering the dimensions correctly. I think it&rsquo;s more like two inches honestly, I was never very good at understanding such things. What&rsquo;s really great about this model is the use of printed elements to complete the look of the breathing apparatus controls on his torso and the grille facial mask. This triangular element is rather new and looks great, I hope to see it used more often and in many other colours for some fun and interesting build ideas.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Vader gets to hold his Lightsaber of course, and he has a stand. What I find rather curious about these stands is that LEGO seems to have gotten rid of the printed numbered tiles that we saw earlier in the line. Possibly due to the nature of the size of the models or the need to reduce unnecessary parts. It is a shame, but if you really wanted a uniform display for all your BrickHeadz I&rsquo;m sure you got get the Series 2 printed element off BrickLink for making your own stands.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As a BrickHeadz fan and a Star Wars fan this set is pure menacing cuteness. I wholeheartedly recommend tracking it down if you haven&rsquo;t done so already, and know that you can&rsquo;t go wrong with these sets. BrickHeadz as a whole are just fun, pure and simple, and while some folks may not appreciate the aesthetics, they can still appreciate the sheer number of interesting new elements we&rsquo;ve seen because of them. Strongly Recommended.</p>

"Lego_fan_","2019-12-31T01:10:25.61Z","The Dark lord","<p>Lego Star Wars set #41619 Darth Vader&nbsp;is a great addition to any Brick headz collection.</p>

<p>Lord Vader is the standard height of a Brick headz but this time is mostly black elements. He inclueds&nbsp;a minifigure&nbsp;lightsaber,&nbsp; two hands to hold stuff is, a display stand and some decorated elemets.</p>

<p>These&nbsp; elements consist of a triangle tile with a grill pattern for his mask, a 1x4 tile for his belt and the standard Brick Headz&nbsp;torso part descorated like his control panel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall i think they did a great job making Darth Vader into Brick Headz form and i would point&nbsp;this set to any Star Wars or Brick headz&nbsp;collector.&nbsp;</p>

<p>No playability as it&#39;s mostly for display. The value is amazing though as the details used to create Darth Vader are amazing. The printed parts give a lot of life to the build and could potentially be used for other builds. The building experience was awesome as you build Darth Vader, and&nbsp;it turns out smooth.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-08T15:35:30.447Z","Luke, I am your father","<p>This is an example of a really good brickhead. When somebody looks at this they can instantly tell that it is Darth Vader. He has his right arm out so that it looks like he is force choking someone and he has his lightsaber in his left hand. The printing on the belt, torso, mouth, and helmet all look amazing and really make the set come to life and look like it does in the movies. I would highly recommend getting this set for anyone that has seen a Star Wars movie.</p>
