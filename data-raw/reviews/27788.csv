Some of the fan designs as well as some of LEGO&#39;s brick-build designs such as&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8008-1/Stormtrooper"">8008</a>&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8008-1/Stormtrooper"">Stormtrooper</a>&nbsp;were a little rough. I was very pleased however when I saw pictures of this set and I knew that I had to buy it. It matched the brickheadz&nbsp;style and it looked great as a cartoony version of a stormtrooper.</p>

<p>There are 4 printed parts to create the belt, vents on the helmet, and the front of the helmet. The helmet is also nicely smoothed out has a fun, cartoony vive that still captures the look of a stormtrooper&nbsp;perfectly. A nice inclusion by the designer was a 2/2 round plate in the recently introduced teal color. I had no teal pieces until it was reintroduced this year so this is nice to have. The chest area is a little plain, but it is mostly covered by the chin-area of the helmet&nbsp;so I am not too upset about it. I also really appreciate&nbsp;the brick-built detail on the back of the brickhead. It looks a lot better than a print and it was a nice addition to include.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a perfect brickhead. It&nbsp;uses a perfect&nbsp;mixture of prints and brick-build&nbsp;detail. It would be great to get several of these&nbsp;and it would look great in an army of stormtrooper brickheadz. I think that this is the best Star Wars brickheadz&nbsp;so far and I think that all LEGO Star Wars fans should have at least one of this set in their collection.</p>

The first stormtrooper helmet was very blocky and didn&#39;t look good at all. This one has the curves and shaping that it deserves. The prints on this ar very nice with the belt, mouth piece, and cheek of the helmet being printed. This set looks amazing if you buy 2 of the and then put them on either side of the Darth Vader brickhead. I would recommend buying only 1 of these if you have seen Star Wars but 2 of them if you already have the Darth Vader brickhead.</p>

<p>It is just like any other Brick Headz in it&#39;s height, it has it&#39;s pink brain inside, it has a display stand, but this one looks like a stormtrooper and has a blaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has decorated parts which consist of the blue grills on the sides of his helmet, His nose and mouth area, and his utility belt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall i think this set was a fun build, looks great, and is a must have to any Star Wars, or Brick Headz collector.&nbsp;</p>
