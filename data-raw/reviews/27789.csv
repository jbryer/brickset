And in celebration of that Disney and LEGO teamed up to give us two great BrickHeadz sets. I am sad to say I did not get Minnie. And these were both highly popular and sought after in spite of BrickHeadz not being huge demand items, from what I&rsquo;ve observed of the product.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: The 90 Year celebration of the beloved icon included a unique package design across all releases of toys of the venerated movie star. This was a yellow colour design with a logo stating 90 Years and Mickey The True Original. It&rsquo;s an interesting concept and the box does look nice, so there is that.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: Easy to follow. Folded in half. Hard to keep open. Does anyone else feel the sudden urge to skip the broken record comments? Actually at this point I might skip discussing the manuals and move right on to the parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It&rsquo;s Mickey Mouse. You&rsquo;ve got your reds, your blacks, your yellows. Actually scratch that, the typical Mickey Mouse boots seem to be slightly more orange than yellow, it&rsquo;s a bit of a blend between the two. Oh yes, all your standard BrickHeadz elements are here, but we also have two black round dishes for the ears. Great parts pack.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Building Mickey Mouse is actually quite fun. He has limited printing due to the nature of the character, but the model is extremely fun to build and he looks almost perfect once you finish him off.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Mickey looks great. Everything is captured almost perfectly. My one complaint is the ears. They look great, but they have this annoying tendency to just pop out of the clips, making this the first BrickHeadz that needs to be repaired at times should the ear pop out while dusting or moving the shelf around.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As an Anniversary product this is a nice item to have. It also makes for a great addition to the other LEGO Disney based BrickHeadz. My only complaint is the ears. I love how they captured the look of him properly, but I can&rsquo;t stand how easy it is for them to just come out of the clips. I feel a better option was there to make these and in the end the designers just didn&rsquo;t have enough time to do so. Still I&rsquo;d recommend this set, but I do caution that it&rsquo;s going to be expensive on the secondary market. Recommended.</p>
