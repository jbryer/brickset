Minnie was released alongside her iconic fellow mouse Mickey.</p>

<p>Lets look at this awesome, cute and awesome display piece.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Minnie uses 124 of the parts to a great advantage. Starting from her iconic bow, the bow is built using two inverted slopes in red printed with 5 spots each attached onto a 1x1 brick with studs on all sides to connect it together with some 1x1 red tiles. Her head is nearly identical to that of Mickeys&nbsp;with two dishes in a black colour for each ear that are connected from a clip that&rsquo;s indebted into her heads build. The back of her head is flat and pretty much the same of the sides but with a bit of tan that isn&rsquo;t continued from the face. Speaking of her face, her noise is a simple black stud on a tan jumper plate that is slightly sticking out by half a plates height. Minnie&rsquo;s eyes are the usual Brickheadz printed 1x1 round plate eyes. Above her eyes there is a exclusive eyebrow print on a 1x4 tan tile then 4 quarter tiles that round of her head perfectly.</p>

<p>Now her body build is similar to some of the 70 odd other Brickheadz. Using some of the 1x2x1and3/4 bricks with four studs on one side to hold her arms.&nbsp;There are a total of 7 new prints for her pock-a-dot dress, two 1x4 red bricks, 4 corner slopes in red and a 2x2 slope in red. These prints bring excellent detail. At the back, a black whip piece is used for her tail that is inserted into a black technic pin in the simple build.</p>

<p>Her legs are just one plate thick as Minnie&rsquo;s yellow shoes are built, these shoes are the biggest i&rsquo;ve seen for a Brickheadz characte. Due to the size of her shoes a new type of base is used using a 6x6 black plate with a 2x4 and 1x2 tile but has two 1x2 black jumpers. Sadly no printed plaque which stopped earlier this year with wave 2.</p>

<p><b>______________________________</b></p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>To conclude my reveiw of then iconic mouse, i&rsquo;d definitely say to anybody to get the Minnie and Mickey Brickheadz. I&rsquo;d say this as Minnie is well built and detailed. Also i love the many prints used throughout the build with a whopping 11 prints overall.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Great prints, well detailed and designed, fun to build, easily recognisable</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>None to mention</p>

<p>(Also these are currently LEGO&nbsp;exclusives, so a LEGOLAND, LEGO Store and LEGO Shop at home all should have this)</p>
