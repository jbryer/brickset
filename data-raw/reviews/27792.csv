"Linley98","2018-12-21T14:34:28.74Z","Very few good minifigs, with too many droids","<p>I was not impressed by this advent calender due to it&#39;s many of it&#39;s mini figures&nbsp;being not impressive and there not being enough actual mini figures. All of the droids and the weird red thing were poor and in my opinion a droid shouldn&#39;t count as a mini figure. The only mini figures&nbsp;I found ok were&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw963/antoc-merrick-(75213)"">Antoc Merrick&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;,&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw857/rose-tico"">Rose Tico</a>,&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw851/rowan-tan-jacket"">Rowan - Tan Jacket</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw807/imperial-death-trooper"">Imperial Death Trooper</a>, however none of these are outstanding.</p>

<p>I did like some of the mini builds however I buy the advent calenders for it&#39;s mini figures, so I don&#39;t really care about the mini builds- My favorite was the snowman.</p>

<p>This will be the last star wars advent calender I get unless I see a good improvement for the minifigures&nbsp;next year. If not I will buy battle packs which have good mini figures like the Jedi and clone battle pack, which has two impressive jedi mini figures.</p>

<p>These are all my opinions, please don&#39;t take it too seriously</p>

<h2>Packaging</h2>

<p>Same old advent calendar package, this time with a snowy scene on the box.&nbsp; Whatever, kind of hard to open nicely without ripping it.</p>

<h2>Day 1: Landspeeder</h2>

<p>Ok, I think this was in some other advent calendar before this one, I do appreciate how it has the gray cone on the left side for the missing engine cover. 3/5</p>

<h2>Day 2: Rose Tico</h2>

<p>Pretty nice, only included in one other set.(resistance transport pod) Not very interesting minifigure, but at least has a gun. 3.5/5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Day 3: The Arrowhead</h2>

<p>I&#39;ll be honest, I didn&#39;t know what this was at first. It&#39;s quite a simple build, but looking at it now, I quite like how the kyber core is represented, but not how the wings/&nbsp;cannons&nbsp;on the side are with the handlebar piece. eh. 2.5/5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Day 4:&nbsp;Republic Assault Tank</h2>

<p>I actually enjoyed this build for day 4! Something to spice it up a little. Very nice part use with the minifigure levers as blasters and the backpack piece on top as the hatch on top. Very clever Lego, very clever. Plus, it has the hovering effect that some don&#39;t appreciate as much nowadays, but I still find delight in. 5/5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Day 5: IG-88</h2>

<p>Bland for what it is, but is only included in 2 other sets in the past 5 years, one being the giant cloud city set. I do enjoy the head print though. Kind&nbsp;of whatever but still a suitable choice. 3/5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Day 6: Cloud City</h2>

<p>I did not see this coming... An interesting choice on lego&#39;s part for a model. Certainly not a bad build, but kind of boring overall. 2.5/5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Day 7: Naboo Starfighter</h2>

<p>This one showed up in some other advent calendar as well, I think. Oh well. At least it still looks good so if you have the other one, you can have a &quot;fleet&quot; of these things. Looks fine by itself as well though. 3/5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Day 8: Battle Droid</h2>

<p>It&#39;s a regular,plain old battle droid. It&#39;s like these have a mandatory presence in advent calendars! Nuff&nbsp;Said! 1/5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Day 9: General Grievous&#39;&nbsp;Starfighter</h2>

<p>This is not a new build either... Sadly. It still works well here, and looks nice next the other builds. However, this calendar is starting to get kind of prequel heavy... 3/5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Day 10: Blaster Cannon</h2>

<p>Cool, has a stud shooter mounted which certainly adds a point, but is quite plain and very generic looking. Also, those blue pins are sticking out on the sides and drives me nuts looking at it. 3/5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Day 11: Rowan Freemaker</h2>

<p>This thing... UGH! never seen the show, and the flesh color is off compared to Rose&#39;s (the only other actual minifig&nbsp;in the calendar so far) but the hair and short legs are a bonus of some sort. 3/5</p>

<h2>Day 12: Anakin&#39;s Jedi Starfighter</h2>

<p>I like this one. It looks very nice, I like the grey curved slopes and the white stud for R2. Not the greatest, but certainly an improvement. 4/5</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Day 13: Imperial Troop Transport</h2>

<p>Very nice model, One of my favourites in terms of playability and looks. My only complaint is that the cannon is too long but overall one of my favourites. 4/5</p>

<h2>Day 14: Weapon Rack</h2>

<p>Curse you, Advent Calendar gods!!!! At least it comes with 2 of the somewhat rarer long rifles. 1/5</p>

<h2>Day 15:Death Trooper</h2>

<p>Yes! I love this minifigure. The helmet is a fantastic mould, but it has to borrow a weapon from the weapon rack. Overall though a great minifigure, even if it&#39;s the more common version. 5/5</p>

<h2>Day 16: Rathtar</h2>

<p>I don&#39;t mind this build. It&#39;s small and represents a small rathtar well. I also like using the clip piece for the mouth, it&#39;s smart. 4/5</p>

<h2>Day 17: Guavian Death Gang member</h2>

<p>First, I adore the helmet mold. It looks great, except the hole at the top &quot;for safety reasons&quot;. The red torso also is great for custom minifigs, especially bounty hunters or custom types of soldiers. 5/5</p>

<h2>Day 18:First Order SF Tie Fighter</h2>

<p>It&#39;s not my favourite build out of the advent calendar, but it&#39;s not especially bad either. Pretty average I guess. 3/5</p>

<h2>Day 19:AT-ACT</h2>

<p>This is one of my favourites. The orange colouring doesn&#39;t bother me that much, and the reason I like this one is the poseable legs and head. 5/5</p>

<h2>Day 20:Zeta-Class Shuttle</h2>

<p>While this is a fairly obscure vehicle from Rogue One, It&#39;s recognizable to those who know what it is. However, I would like to see the wings be moveable, as I feel the build is too static. 3/5</p>

<h2>Day 21: Speeder Bike</h2>

<p>Unique, that&#39;s what I have to say. I like the piece usage for the handlebars and having a stand is definitely appreciated. 5/5</p>

<h2>Day 22: Vaporator Christmas Tree</h2>

<p>Finally, getting into the more chrstmas-themed items, is a moisture vaporator colored in green and with a small &quot;star&quot; at the top. It&#39;s really cute, and having 4 sand green clip pieces is nice. 4/5</p>

<h2>Day 23:Antoc Merric</h2>

<p>Eh. I really don&#39;t see the appeal for this minifigure. I guess the head print is nice, but other than that there&#39;s not much to say about it. 3/5</p>

<h2>Day 24: Snowman</h2>

<p>I guess that&#39;s why we needed to have Antoc Merric as day 23, because I kind of like this one. The head print with the extra blue is nice, and the helmet is cool too. I would have rather seen this done with maybe rebel pilot Luke though.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Verdict and Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Compared to other Advent Calendars, this one is slightly lower than average. With only 7 figures (2 being droids) and only one being sort of exclusive, it&#39;s simply not very desirable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, you made it too the end, I hope you found it helpful&nbsp;</p>
