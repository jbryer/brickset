<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pro&#39;s-</p>

<p>(My opinion) This Anakin&nbsp;Jedi Starfighter is a more detailed build than the 2008 version.</p>

<p>The Anakin&nbsp;Skywalker minifigure is very well detailed than i expected &amp; easily customizable.</p>

<p>Con&#39;s-</p>

<p>If you have at least one R2-D2&nbsp;minifigure from the last few years, this set comes with another one.</p>

<p>I do wish they gave Anakin&nbsp;a different head piece without the headset prop from episode 3&nbsp;or had one side of the headpiece with the headset &amp; the other without one.</p>

<p>The minifigures,</p>

<p>Anakin&nbsp;Skywalker: Anakin has been updated&nbsp;since the last time he came in a set. He now has leg printing and has very good printing on the torso as well. His hair went back to the lighter color that it was, back during the Clone wars sets. He has the pilot headset on both sides of his head as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>R2-D2: This version of R2 has become one of the most common figures to get in Lego Star Wars. He has come in so many different sets, and this one is the same as the last one. However while he is the same, he is still a good figure.</p>

<p>The Set: the ship has been vastly improved upon and is much better then the last one. The color scheme is very consistent, and is pleasing to the eye to look at. It has two stud cannons on both wings, and has a clip for the lightsaber on the bottom, as well as one landing leg. The cockpit, opens up the same way as the last sets did, and the control piece has a unique print on it. In the front of the ship, right in front of R2, you can remove the triangular piece, and put some more ammo for the cannons. The engines have been updated and are now black with some green pieces making it look like the ship is actually flying. There are a couple of stickers in this set, however they make the set look so much better. Overall this set is well worth the cost and worthy to ad to your Star Wars collection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall: like I said before, I really like this set and think that it is worth the price. The set costs $20, which is more reasonable and better then some other sets from this year. I think that the fighter is much better the pun the last, however one problem that isn&rsquo;t to bad but is a little annoying, Is the gap between the wings and the body of the ship. It isn&rsquo;t big, but it is noticeable. One thing that is really good is that the underside of the ship stays consistent with the color scheme and actually looks good. Like I said before the figures are good, however I wished that Anakin&nbsp;had one side of his head without the headset, so that we could use him for other things. However this isn&rsquo;t to bad of a problem. Lego uses the clone wars body but makes it more like it would look like if it was in the movies, which looks really good. Overall I would say that for $20 dollars, this set is amazing. The ship looks very good and it comes with some very good minifigs. If you are a fan of the clone wars, or just a fan of Star Wars, them you are going to love this set.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"maharage923","2018-11-27T00:45:42.793Z","Lousy design; Star Wars team out of ideas","<p>I almost never buy Star Wars sets anymore, for two reasons:</p>

<p>1. I much prefer the Marvel Super Heroes sets</p>

<p>2. Star Wars sets keep getting rebooted, and in this case, definitely not for the better.</p>

<p>Looking ahead at what is coming for 2019, both of the larger sets have exactly been done, with the cannon on the AT-AP exactly the same as the old one, so why buy it? The sets based on the new movies are nice, but in the coming years will be remade again and again.</p>

<p>For this set specifically, the design is horrible. There are huge gaps between the wings and the body, the body is skinny and mostly just 2-wide plates stacked up, so it looks bad from most angles. Even though the wings are not supposed to move, touching them at all will loosen them from the poorly designed attachment points. It looks somewhat similar to the Saasee Tiin&#39;s Starfighter from several years ago but despite the new pieces, it&#39;s less sleek and detailed than that one was, and the tiny stud shooters are lackluster. The minifigs are nothing special.</p>

<p>I only bought this set because I need some of the parts, it was overstocked at Walmart, and I can sell the figures to collectors to nearly break even. I built it at work and will absolutely take it apart as soon as I get home.</p>

"DutchFlyer","2018-11-18T07:38:17.943Z","A nice addition to the Jedi-Starfighter line-up","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The Jedi-Starfighter&nbsp;is in my opinion one of the most attractive Star Wars starfighters, for its shape and its colour schemes. And for some of them, the minifigures&nbsp;are quite appealing as well. Slowly I am trying to collect more of them, so I could not resist picking up this one.&nbsp;It is cheaper than the more recent additions to the Jedi starfighter line-up, though its European RRP is still - IMHO - outright thievery when you compare it to the US price. (over 50% up in price).&nbsp;Its construction is simple and fun, there are a number of easy to apply stickers. It looks good, though I am not sure what to make of the stud-shooter replacing the spring-loaded shooters.</p>

<p>Overs all, is it an excellent set? When not looking at price, it is. Is it a good set? At US prices is it. But there is no way I can recommend this set at European RRP&#39;s. Only at some 20% off (so around 25 euro&#39;s or less) does it start to offer acceptable value for money.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The construction of this set is simple, and it took me some 50 minutes to have her built. There are 7 stickers, all easy to apply. And - IMHO - they all add to the overall looks. Recommended age is 7 to 12 years old. And 7 year olds should definitely be able to build this set, many 6 year olds probably can.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The basic shape of the Jedi Starfighter&nbsp;makes for a construction that is similar to that of its predecessors: <strong>Plo Koon&#39;s Starfighter (set 8093)</strong>, <strong>Saesee Tiin&#39;s Starfighter (set 9498)</strong> or&nbsp; <strong>Anakin&#39;s&nbsp;custom Jedi Starfighter (set 75087)</strong>. All are basically a main fuselage acting like a spine,&nbsp;with two wings attached. The biggest difference in construction between this set and previous Jedi Starfighters is the attachment of the wing to the main fuselage. No ratchet joints, but Technic pins and connectors. This seems to be a technique borrowed from the <strong>Sandspeeder (set 75204)</strong>&nbsp;I did not see any truly special parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I have no complaints about its construction, other than seeing no reason why there are three bags provided, where two would have done nicely (the third is for a single wing!).</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>This version of R2-D2 is a very common minifig&nbsp;(found in 5 other sets). The print is nice, and on my copy the print&nbsp;on the dome was in register; I am not sure if that holds true for all copies, as an earlier copies/iterations of R2 droids&nbsp;(in sets&nbsp;I bought one or two&nbsp;years ago) had issues with the print on the dome being wonky. It could also be that Lego has been able to fix that problem.</p>

<p>Anakin is unique to this set. His print is well done on the front and&nbsp;back of the torso, and the legs. It is quite subtle. I like the face prints, both showing him wearing a head set. One has a somewhat angry expression, the other a more determined one. His hair piece is OK.&nbsp;He is armed with a light sabre.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>I am not sure whether to prefer this design or the older ones (the above mentioned three starfighters). I think I prefer the old&nbsp;shape of the nose. That said, I have no idea which one is more accurate, since I am not familiar with the source material. There is a small gap between the wings and the fuselage, but that one seems perfectly acceptable to me. I am not sure what to make of the stud-shooters. I think I would have preferred the spring-loaded shooters underneath the wing. I think the overall colour scheme works well. The clip for Anakin&#39;s&nbsp;light sabre&nbsp;is a good thing.&nbsp;The stickers are also useful, and are worth applying.</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>This starfighter&nbsp;is a perfectly fine play set: very swooshable, easy to handle, attractive colours, all that a starfighter&nbsp;requires. The studshooter is also a bonus, and - arguably - is less likely to be triggerd by accident than springloaded shooters would be.</p>

<p>The colour scheme of this starfighter&nbsp;clearly makes for an attractive display piece. Having this one lined up with the older ones, would definitely catch someone&#39;s attention.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Completely ignoring the issue of its price, this is overall a good set: well designed, attractive colour scheme, and fun to build. As such it would make a nice gift or a nice addition to a star wars collection. But then the issue of price rears its very ugly head. The European prices are simply indefensible. There is no way they can be objectively justified, IMHO, especially when comparing it to the US price; which means more than a 50% higher price for us Europeans; the Dutch online Lego store lists it for 35 euros, roughly DOUBLE the US price.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As such, for Europeans, I simply cannot recommend this set at all. The sole reason I got it, was because I found it on a discount. Sure, if you are desperate for a Star Wars set, want to complete a collection, or obsessed with anything Anakin, go for it. For everybody else: leave it on the shelves.</p>

In my opinion, the 2008 was choppy and rough around the build&#39;s edges. The figures are the same Anakin and R2-D2&nbsp;just updated with better printing and detail. The new one has stud shooters, while the old one has flick fires. The new one just looks better and is a great, cheap set.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-01T21:09:18.557Z","A great birthday present","<p>This is a remake of a set from 2009 and it greatly resembles the origional design but has made some improvements to it. It is alot bulkier than the origional and is much stronger than the origional which was a bit flimsey and broke easily. The minifigures have both gone up in quality and look much better than the origional set. There is alot of easier playability added to this by using studshooters instead of flick fire missles. There is a clip underneath the ship that holds Anakins lightsaber while he pilots the starfighter. overall this is a very good set for a very good price. I would recommend this set for most kids or for a birthday present as it is cheap but you can still get a lot of fun out of it.</p>
