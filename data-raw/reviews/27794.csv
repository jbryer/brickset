I thought that end of the movie that her character was ruined a little bit but not much. When I saw this set I thought that it was cool however was not the first set in the fall wave that I wanted to get, however the set did not disappoint.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figures: the set contains 3 characters, Enfys Nest, Weazel, and Tob&iacute;as Beckett. All three of these figures are well done and are highly detailed.</p>

<p>Enfys&nbsp;Nest: she is the leader of the cloud riders, and is really the main draw to this set. We did not get this her in the first wave of Solo sets, so it&rsquo;s nice to finally get her. She has a short cape, that has a burnt orange on the inside and on the other side there is a small print of a fur. She does have leg printing and back printing, which looks very good. Her helmet is one of the best helmets done by Lego, and it very accurate to the movie. On the back of her helmet, she has she spikes sticking out of her helmet. These are made out of rubber and not plastic. For her weapon she has a staff like weapon. There is one of those new blade pieces&nbsp;that makes up the top part of her staff. The middle of her weapon is a lightsaber&nbsp;handle, and then the bottom part is made from a spear. One big problem with her is that she doesn&rsquo;t have a face. She only has a black head. Just like her minion Weazel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tobias Beckett: &nbsp;this is the second best figure in this set. He came In the tie fighter from the first wave of Solo sets. However this version of Beckett is in his regular outfit that he wore throughout the entire movie. He comes it&rsquo;s two silver pistols and has the new Mr. Incredible hairpiece. His face I believe is different, and the printing on his torso and legs is very well done. He also comes with the same weapons like he did in the tie fighter, he also does not have a double sided head.</p>

<p>Weazel: is the last figure in this set. He is part of Nest&rsquo;s gang and is the shortest figure in this set. Like Nest, he also has a unique helmet, however his is plastic unlike his boss. He also has a black head, however on both sides of the head there is some metal printed on it. He like the other two figures has good printing on his torso, and he also has short legs which aren&rsquo;t the ones that can bend. His weapon is a heavy modified blaster, which is made from an alien quest blaster, and binoculars are attached to the end of it. He like the other two figures are only unique to the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set: the set comes with two speeders. Nest&rsquo;s bike came only seat one figure&quot; on the bottom there are a pair of stud shooters. The back of the speeder has a fin that has a red stripe of it. This looks cool, however it looks good from really&nbsp;one side. The engines look really good and are very well built up. Weazel&rsquo;s bike has a sidecar attached to it and is much bigger than Nest&rsquo;s bike. The back of the bike looks unfinished which fits with the rugged look of the bikes. There is a stud cannon on both sides of the bike. There is a spot on the sidecar that you can store the cargo that comes with this set. A cool part of this big speeder is hat you can detach the sidecar and make it another speeder to use. You don&rsquo;t even have to take the pieces that connect the speeders together. If you take the red pins off then you can make it look like part&nbsp;of the the exhaustion for the speeder. However the sidecar doesn&rsquo;t have any controls on it so you would have to add your own. The best looking part of the speeder is the engines. They are really well built up look very nice. Both speeders have a good and consistent color scheme. However there is one blue pin rapt the front of Nest&rsquo;s bike which sorta sticks out. Both speeders are well built and are a good collection Solo collection&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall: this set is really fun and is well built. It also comes with a container of coaxium, which is important to the whole Solo plot. You are able to store one container on the speeders, however you would have to change the speeders to make room to hold more. The figures are all really good, however It is odd that weazel&nbsp;comes in this set. Sure he fits in the set, but he is hardly in the movie at all. The set goes very well with the Imperial transport train and the at hauler. However the set can be a little boring on its own. The set is good but not as good as some of the others. It is 30 dollars which is pricey, but it&rsquo;s not bad. I would recommend getting a Anakin&rsquo;s Jedi starfighter&nbsp;or even Snoke&rsquo;s throne room. I think that it would be better to get this set on discount then getting at full price. However overall this is a good set and I would recommend it.</p>

<p>One of the most striking, and arguably most appealing sets of the Star Wars Solo sets was set 75215:&nbsp;Cloud-Rider swoop-bikes. It is colourful, the minifigures look spectacular, it is very swooshable, and well priced (for a Star Wars set). The build is fun, though there are quite a few stickers to apply. You get two bikes that on their own already provide for a lot of play opportunities. Add in sets 75217 (Conveyex transport) and 75219 (AT-Hauler) and you can actually recreate a whole scene, with good, evil and truly evil parties involved. Overall, I think this a very good set: good price, good minifigures, good looks and good play opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>Overall, the build took about 60 minutes at a (very) leisurely pace. The recommended age is 8-14 years old, which for once I can understand. I do think many younger children will be able to complete this set, but getting the &#39;three-bar-front&#39; constructed properly might be tricky for some. The stickers - 13 in total - are easy to apply.</p>

<p>One starts with the construction of Weazel&#39;s&nbsp;swoop bike and side-&#39;car&#39;, in two bags. I truly liked the way the bikes were constructed. Perhaps no truly special construction techniques were used, but it was all still interesting to me. I like&nbsp;the construction of the exhausts. I am not sure what to make of the construction of the front of the bike. Perhaps the black Technic piece and the red axle could be swapped for grey&nbsp;elements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enfys Nest&#39;s swoop bike is actually smaller than Weazel&#39;s.&nbsp; I likes the construction of this one the best of the three elements. The construction of the rear - with all the tilted elements - was most interesting, and effective in the end. Truly well done by the designer. Unfortunately, where in the rear the ugly blue Technic pins have been covered up, there is one highly visible at&nbsp;the front. Again, if you have old grey&nbsp;pins, swap them out.</p>

<h2>The minigures</h2>

<p>IMHO two of the three minifigures are spectacular, but unfortunately not without fault. Bonus us that all three minfigures are unique to this set. Tobias Beckett&#39;s minifig is the most ordinary of all, though sitll very good. He wears a long dark tan coat over grey overalls. The print is highly detaild (though many of the details are quite subtle) and is continued nicely from torso to the legs. I also like his (single) face print - with a subtle unshaven look, though I am not sure what to make from the expression in his eyes. I really like his hair piece.</p>

<p>Weazel and Enfys Nest unfortunately do not have a face print, only black minifig heads. And frankly, I am at a loss to explain why. The only reason I can think of is their necks being visible, and that it not being black would pose a problem. Personally, I would have loved to see what a designer would have done with Enfys&#39; face.</p>

<p>Weazel has short legs (no print), but this is made up for by a very lovely and extremely detailed torso print (front and back) and multi-coloured (and multi-mould) helmet piece. The print is also in register, on the helmet and the torso.</p>

<p>Enfys Nest is IMHO the best minifigure of all. I would go so far as to say that if she had had a normal head with face-print, she could have been one of the best Star Wars Minifigs ever; I think the rest of the minfigure is that good. She has a stiff-cloth cape (with subtle print on the outside), and a highly decorative print on the front and back of the torso. The front print is also very detailed, and a good depiction of her clothing in the movie.It is also continued nicely on the front of the legs. The helmet is a duo mould, or rather two moulds (grey soft plastic, light tan hard plastic) pushed into each other. The print on the helmet is again very good and highly detailed. As a result, the spiked helmet comes out looking great. I also like the staff weapon she is armed with.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Overall, I think the builds are a very good representation of the swoop bikes from the movie. I like the colour scheme. The construction elements are nicely covered up, while the stickers add something to the bikes. I agree with the designer&#39;s choice to only have a stickered red trailing edge on the rear vertical stabilizer&nbsp;of Enfys&#39; bike. There is no Lego piece availabe that would have allowed for a different choice, and a fin of double thikness would heve been just plain ugly. The only issue I have are with the red and blue Technic pins used in the front, to keep the tripple bar construction together. Unfortunately, they seem to be the only pieces Lego has available that fit the construction needs in those spots. The studshooters are well integrated into the build; they look almost natural additions.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>Arguably this is first and foremost a play set. The bikes are very swooshable, light, easy to handle yet do not feel flimsy. One needs to pay a little bit of attention to the studshooters, as one might shoot a stud by accident when picking up the bike. That said, there are many spare studs included. The box with coaxium also suggests that this is a play set.</p>

<p>That said, the bikes look good enought to be able to turn them into a small display. One could build a stand for them, and with the gorgeous minifigs of Weazel and Enfys Nest, they make for a very good little display.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>This set might arguably be the best set of the first Star Wars Solo wave. The builds are good, the minfigs are excellent, and for a good price. Many of the sets in the Solo wave were quite good. In some ways I think this set can be compared with set 70607&nbsp;Ninjago City Chase: a very good set at a good price that has to compete against other sets in a generally good wave. Of the lower end sets in this wave, I like this one the best. I would not hesitate to pick it up, for your own collection or as a gift.</p>

"vikings","2020-06-09T04:09:59.78Z","Cloud-Rider Swoop Bikes","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a medium size box. The dimensions of the box are 10.3 x 7.5 x 2.4 inches and weighs 0.81 pounds. It has two small/medium instruction booklets. In the first booklet you build the larger swoop bike and in the second one you build the smaller one.</p>

<p><b>Parts:</b></p>

<p>You get a few cool parts in this set. You get a black roller skate, a few black bars, two trans clear blue dishes, four 1x4 mounted stud shooters, and a 2x2 dark grey crate. The dark&nbsp;tan colors are nice to get as well. You get 13 stickers in this set (7 on Enfys Nest&#39;s bike and 6 on Weazel&#39;s) 12 of them on the wings/flaps on the front of the bike and one is on the fin on Enfys Nest&#39;s bike. The total piece count for the set is 355. Overall a decent piece haul.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigures:</b></p>

<p>All the minifigures in this set are exclusive, and they only appear in this set. All the figures are really good and it is nice that they have normal weapons and not stud shooters.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Enfys Nest:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Enfys Nest is a great figure to get and is amazing. She has a new helmet mold with light grey rubber pieces sticking out the back of it. She has a plain black head and a hard cape. The cape is&nbsp;black with (what I believe is) her hair on it and on the other side it is orange. She has printing on both sides of her torso. On the front she has a big tooth necklace and a belt. On the back is just some outlines of the shirt she is wearing. She has printing on her legs of brown, orange, and tan colors on them. She is armed with a 3 piece staff. The pieces are a silver machete, light grey lightsaber hilt, and a silver spike.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Weazel:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Weazel is another nice figure to get. He has another new helmet mold with tan, red, and silver colors on it. There is an antenna on the side of it as well. He has a black head with a very dark tan rectangle (on both sides of the head) with markings on the inside of it (I can&#39;t really tell, it really blends in with the black). He has printing on both sides of his torso. He has bones and a lot of rope on the front of it and a lot of red rope and brown fur on the back. He has short red legs. He has a space gun with a dark grey binocular.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Tobias Beckett:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Tobias is my favorite figure in the set (and one my favorite characters in the film). He has a new tan hair piece and single sided head. He has a neutral facial expression with&nbsp;tan facial hair. He has printing on both sides of his torso. On the front he has his dark tan jacket with dark grey shirt under it. On the back it outlines the jacket. He has printing of his jacket from his torso onto his legs. He has two silver pistols as weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:</b></p>

<p>The build was pretty easy and really enjoyable. The techniques used to create the speeders are really cool to experience during the build. You have two separate builds which is the larger swoop bike (Flown by Weazel) and the smaller swoop bike (flown by Enfys Nest). Overall a really nice and fun build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall this is an amazing set. The swoop bikes are amazing. Enfys Nest&#39;s bike is my favorite of the two (both are amazing I just like this more). You have an adjustable steering handle and has two stud shooters as weapons. It has the large fin and three engines in the back. The other swoop bike has two parts to it. The main part and then (what I call it) the side-car. It has two stud shooters and three cannons as weapons on it. You have two black levers to control the bike. You have two big engines and some very cool looking seats for the driver and rider. The two are connected in the middle and can adjust the height of either bike. I do wish they added another figure so you could have all three seats between the two bikes with a person in them instead of having an open seat. You also get a crate with some coaxium in it. The figures are great and are all exclusive to this set. The figures do a nice job of capturing the look of the characters from the movie. Overall a well done set. I highly recommend adding this set to Star Wars or Lego collection. This set will make a great addition and look great in anyones collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Lego_fan_","2019-05-06T14:47:01.277Z","highly detailed bikes.","<p>this neat little set comes right from the train heist scene in Solo a Star Wars story. these highly detailed bikes come with a great part selection for building your MOC with. the set includes Becket, Enfys nest, and Weazel. it has a pair of bikes and a crate for storing extra shooting studs. Enfys nest&#39;s bike is the smaller of the bikes and it has movable handle bars an adjustable fin, and dual stud shooters on the sides. Weazel&#39;s bike is the larger and includes the main bike with side car for holding cargo or extra thugs. it has a chair on both the main bike and the side car and stud shooters as well as movable handle bars. this wonderful set is great for play as well as display and could be combined with the other train heist sets. i would highly recamend this set to any Star Wars or Lego fan that wants a play set or just a neat collecable item.&nbsp;</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-07T22:04:28.777Z","Very Good Speeders","<p>The minifigures in this set are really cool. Tobias Beckett isn&#39;t bad but he is not great. The swoop bikes can be used in other ways as well, like speeders for your Rebel army, or something that somebody keeps in their ship as a recon vehicle. They are very sturdy and the only real downfall to this set is that there are a ton of stickers for it. Overall I highly recommend buying this set before it is gone.</p>
