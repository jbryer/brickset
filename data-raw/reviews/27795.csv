"Andersond","2018-08-18T01:46:13.973Z","The supreme leaders throne room ","<p>Ever since i&nbsp;saw the images for this set I was excited. I looked forward to getting the new guards and I thought that the Room was nicely designed. I have heard that, and seen a lot of people complain about the set, about the price etc... however what I have learned from after buying this set is that, you can&#39;t always believe what everyone else says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minfigures</p>

<p>For me, this was my first set with snoke, and the last Jedi version of Rey. I had already gotten kylo and the guards where new figures for the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Snoke: he is exactly the same as the last set that he came out of, however that does not mean that he doesn&#39;t look really good. The only way that Lego could improve this figure is by making him a tad bit taller, but besides that he is still a very good figure. Snoke is the only figure In this set that doesn&#39;t have a weapon at all, but he doesn&#39;t need it</p>

<p>Rey: is the only other figure to come in only one set before this set(snoke is the other one). She is (like snoke) the exact same figure as the one that comes in the first order walker. She is still a very good figure and she comes with a blue lightsaber in this set.</p>

<p>Kylo: like the two previous figures has come in a previous set before. However unlike the other two, he has come in a microfightet set, which makes him the less desirable figure in this set. However he still looks really good and he has the scar on his face with a calm expression and an angry expression. Kylo also comes with his crossgurad lightsaber&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pretorian guards: these two are easily the most desirable figures in this set. The guards that we get are the 5th and 6th guards and they look very good. They have a new shoulder armor piece and a new piece for the helmet. However the helmets are the same for both of them. They both come with two different weapons. One thing them come with a staff and the other comes with a pike weapon, it also comes with the whip slash chain version of the same weapon.</p>

<p>The set: at the front of the set is the turbolift the opens up into the throne room. You came really only fight one figure in it without jamming them in. You can turn the knob on the top to turn the lift around, which works very nicely. The next part of the Room is the bridge which was built very well, which then leads to the main bass of the set. In the middle of the floor, before snokes throne you can put Rey on the tile and, when you pull the red knob you can pull Rey towards snoke. However when you do this it leaves a gap in the floor which isn&#39;t that bad. The next function is to the right of the throne you can put Rey over a tile and when you press down on it you can make Rey jump up. This function is very simple however it works to some degree. The throne itself is very nicely built and looks very nice. You can rotate the throne and you can even take it out of its spot for some more storage space. And lastly on the sides, where the pillars are, at the very bottom you can open it up and put some extra weapons and such in. This is the same for both sides.</p>

<p>Conclusion: I bought this set with some high expections of it and it did not disappoint. The completed set looks very nice and the figures are excellent. However one thing that is missing is the red curtain. This one a big part of the throne room, and some people think that the set looks bad without it. However this is not the case. The sets works down without it and it gives more room to place in the Room with out the curtain taking up space. Another issue is that you can&#39;t put Rey in the turbolift with her handcuffs on. This is a tad bit disappointing however it isn&#39;t bad. An odd part to the set is the inclusion of a chalice for the supreme leader. We never saw snoke use this in the movie so it is odd that the put it in this set however it isn&#39;t bad. And finally the price. Yes the price is $70 for about 500 pieces. It is a expensive set and the price does hurt it. However I would say this. If you don&#39;t have snoke, Rey or kylo, or at least you don&#39;t have two of these figures then I would definitely buy the set hands down. However if you already have these figures then I would think about it more, or wait for it to go on sale. For me personally I didn&#39;t have Rey or snoke, so I was really happy to get this set, however if you do have these figures then I would save your money and get the x wing or another set. However this is still one of the best 2018 sets that Lego had made and I think that a lot of people will have fun with this highly detailed set</p>

	<li>75225: <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/75225-1"">Elite Praetorian Guard Battle Pack</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, these minifigures are some of the best ever produced, representing this stunning scene perfectly.</p>

<p>PARTS</p>

<p>Most of the parts this set is made out of are regular parts you can find any day, except for the circular elements surrounding Snoke&#39;s throne. There are two towers on the right and left sides, made out of mostly beams and sloped bricks. There are some Technic uses at the back, such as the ball attached to the axle, used to pull a plate from the center of the room.</p>

<p>FEATURES</p>

<p>The elevator feature works quite well, with very little Technic parts, surprisingly. There is a double conical wheel and a cross axle with an end stop. You attach the double conical wheel to the end stop, and the axle goes into a round 4x4 plate. There are two round wall pieces that are 4x4x6. They go on the round plate, and you can put another 4x4 plate underneath. The minifigure stands on one, and there is another plate above it, connected to the axle with the wheel at the top. You turn the wheel, the entire system turns. A genius part of this set, and as said earlier, there are few Technics.</p>

<p>The Force pull is a more simple mechanism. In the parts category, it says there is a ball attached to an axle. The ball is also known as a &#39;Voodoo Ball&#39;. The axle fits into a 1x4 beam with 3 holes in it. The 4x4 flat plate with only four studs at the top is above the beam, so when a minifigure is placed on it, you pull the Voodoo Ball back, and the minifigure is pulled forwards, allowing the clever LEGO designers to show Snoke pulling Rey towards him as he searches her mind for Luke Skywalker&#39;s location.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two hidden locations, under the two towers. One with a goblet and handcuffs, and another with a red lightsaber handle attached to a chain, evidently a weapon for the Praetorian Guards. The materials are hidden under two 4x4 flat plates with 4 studs at the top, like the one used iin the force pull feature. They are attached to a technic hinge using an axle and a hole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final key feature is the catapult. There is a 1x3 flat plate, which sticks out. It is attached to a technic piece with only one stud, enabling you to place one foot of a minifig on it, and press on the extended section, launching the minifigure to the left or right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DETAILS</p>

<p>Snoke&#39;s throne, in my opinion, has too much detail. In the movie it is a simple throne. The LEGO version looks that way at first, but then you look at it more closely, and you realize all the unnecessary detail. I agree that it makes the throne fit in with the movie more, with all the unique Star Wars features that make these sets so popular, but he lights and handles at the back are not much needed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The viewing glass Rey looks through as the Resistance fleet is destroyed uses a black lightsaber&nbsp;handle and a 1x1 clear stud.&nbsp;There is a round 2x2 flat plate with a sticker of the Resistance fleet on it, and the glass doesn&#39;t really magnify the image, but it makes the scene more realistic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PLAYABILITY</p>

<p>Rey has her lightsaber, and Kylo Ren has his unique three-bladed one. Perfect lightsaber combat. If you have seen&nbsp;<em>The Last Jedi</em>, you will know that Praetorian Guard weapons are resistant to lightsaber attacks, and can hold up against them, as can Magna Guard weapons from&nbsp;<em>The Clone Wars</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Revenge of the Sith</em>. The catapult can be used to launch Rey at Snoke, and using a camera, you can make an amazing stop motion movie with Snoke and Luke&#39;s lightsaber. You can act out the original scene from the movie, or make up your own story. I, personally think this set has many features for playability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CONCLUSION</p>

<p>This set is amazing. WIth key details, interesting minifigures, and awesome mechanisms and features, this set is a must buy if you don&#39;t have it yet, and is a perfect set to add to your&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>collection. I&#39;m running out of description words for this review. I haven&#39;t used stunning that much, have I? Okay, this is definitely a stunning set, and an another creative and awesome set made by LEGO!</p>

"DutchFlyer","2019-03-02T19:09:21.57Z","Great with a discount","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Lego has produced a number of Star Wars sets representing scenes from the movie series; some smaller (20 - 30 euro range), but also some bigger sets (50 euro and up) like <strong>Palpatine&#39;s&nbsp;Arrest (set 9526)</strong> in 2012 and <strong>Death Star Final Duel (set 75093)</strong> in 2015. Snoke&#39;s Throne Room is one of the latter type of sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a set it is quite a nice set and an OK build. The throne is good, the play features are nice. The set also captures most of the big features of the room as well. The one thing that is missing is the massive red walls. Where Rey, Kylo and Snoke are not unique minifigures&nbsp;while&nbsp;the two Praetorian Guards are. The big problem with this set is its price. Where the price per part might still seem somewhat acceptable, having built the whole thing and looking at the final product, I cannot see how one can reasonably justify paying 70 euros for this set. Find this set on a discount (somewhere under 60 euros) and IMHO then it becomes worth it.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build of this set was OK. It took me about 70 minutes to finish the set. There are some stickers to apply. They definitely add to the looks of the set. A few of them are somewhat tricky, as they have to be applied upon curved surfaces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its construction is similar to that of the other sets: a built up base with play features and then some superstructure representing the big feature elements of the scene. The latter on this occasion are Snoke&#39;s&nbsp;throne and the entry door.&nbsp;</p>

<p>IMHO there were no truly special building techniques used. The rotating entrance, the trap floor - well executed, but all techniques used elsewhere.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>The 5 included minifigures&nbsp;are Snoke, Kylo Ren, two Praetorian Guards, and Rey as the good guy/girl. The prints are all well executed on the front and back of the torso&#39;s, as well as on the legs (base for the Guards). The face prints are good as well, with Kylo and Rey having two prints. Snoke, being bald, of course has a single face print. Only Kylo Ren is available in a&nbsp; cheaper set;&nbsp;Snoke is also found in the <strong>First Order Star Destroyer (set 75190)</strong> and while Rey is found in the <strong>First Order Heavy Assault Walker (set 75189) </strong>both sets with a RRP of 30 euros and higher.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>This set fits the basic design of previous bigger &#39;Star Wars scene&#39; sets: a constructed base with superstructure. Building the base takes up quite a lot of pieces, also having to incorporate some of the play features. The play features themselves - a launcher, sliding floor, stands to be knocked over, a rotating door, the rotating throne, caches) are quite well integrated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The whole build looks like a finished product, rather than an outtake of a much larger scene. That said, this room could arguably be expanded in a MOC into the much larger space from the movie. The overall colour scheme is well done and consistent. I like the details around the door, as well as highly detailed throne. The stickers definitely add to the looks of the model.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This model is both a play and a display model. There are numerous play features included, while the it is big and good-looking enough to be a display set - though I would arguably build this set up a little more before turning it into a true display piece.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, this is not a bad set - it is the RRP that turns it into that. In my personal opinion it is simply overpriced.&nbsp; Even if the PPP is not extremely bad, to paraphrase Jangbricks, &#39;the volume of stuff&#39; does IMHO not justify the 70 euro price tag. Neither do the minifigures. And that is a shame.</p>

"Vikn","2021-02-19T11:16:29.567Z","Discount or skip","<p>This was (I think.. 95% sure) the first lego set I got as an adult that wasn&#39;t a gift and wasn&#39;t of the&nbsp;architecture theme. I stopped playing with lego around 11 or so but saw this on sale 14 years later and had extra cash so thought &quot;why not?&quot;.</p>

<p>On sale, it is a perfectly good set with two cool figures, a whatever and yet another boring ol&#39; rey (both minifig and character). The throne room is interesting with some useful parts. Im always a fan of praetorian guards, emperor&#39;s guards, etc, so I was happy to get a couple of them. Snoke just looks like a doddering old rando and the figure is pretty plain, but he isn&#39;t exactly common with the only other set being one of the large&nbsp;destroyers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t know what to look for at the time but this is definitely a play focused set. Knowing that, I&#39;d have skipped it as I am 28 and have no use for that sort set. But I got a pretty steep discount and was a relatively enjoyable build besides that.</p>

<p>There is some display value, The&nbsp;various iterations of moments between Rey being brought up in cuffs and Kylo standing with Rey&nbsp;as the only two survivors are easy to represent with what&#39;s given. I had bought the praetorian guard battle pack soon after and ended up combining the two sets so I had 5 guards, which was closer to the film.</p>

<p>For a kid, I&#39;m sure this is a great gift even near full price. For any adult fans it can ve worth getting on discount. The original price is absurd and ideally every fan avoids encouraging Lego to sell these sort overpriced sets by never considering it u til a discount, but obviously that&#39;s fantasy&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>They seem to do it every wave,&nbsp; with one set per major IP being an absurd ripoff in both P4P and&nbsp; the sum of its parts. Obviously neither metric is the end all be all quality measure, but despite the &quot;cool&quot; opinion where P4P is meaningless, ignoring it completely is just as silly as using it as the sole measure of value and feels more like a sentiment echoed to show how much of a &quot;real&quot; fan someone is by contradicting the norm among fans.</p>

<p>But in this case, p4p and the whole are way overpriced without a discount so both camps and the rest will likely be turned off from it initially.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So from me...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Full price: Pass. Preferable not to&nbsp;encourage lego doing this (ahem, grevious ship this year)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But as it drops 15-40, it&#39;s worth considering. The display value may seem lacking and again, it is play focused, it is surprisingly easy to have the set look cool as a display piece. Especially if you can pair it with the Praetorian BP.</p>
