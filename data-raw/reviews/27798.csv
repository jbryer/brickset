<p>The AT-Hauler was an integral part to one of the more central scenes of the Solo movie, and due to its role and looks, a logical choice for a Lego rendition. It was high on my wishlist, but its price put me off a little. I picked it up as part of a sale, and am glad I did. Yes, I still feel it is quite expensive, though not as overpriced as I feared.</p>

<p>The build was fun, and I think the designer has done a very good job in hiding the Technic core of the lift-arms, covering up unsightly (off-colour) elements, or not using them at all in the first place. IMHO that is as it should be. The minifigures&nbsp;are a big plus.</p>

<p>The kit can be used as a play set, but it is surprisingly heavy. The AT-Hauler is also quite swooshable, and it seems to me that 9 year olds should be able to handle it properly - though the overall weight might be a problem. The pay-load (a container with rifles) is surprisingly secure when hung in the lift-arms. As a display set, one would probably need to build a stand if one wants to display the hauler with a pay-load.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is a good set, in many ways on par with the likes of <strong>Krennic&#39;s&nbsp;Shuttle (set 75156)</strong> or the <strong>Y-wing (set 75172)</strong> as a build. I feel though, it is somewhat expensive. Yes, it is worthy of consideration even at full price, but at a discount it should appeal to Staw Wars fans, and even non-Star Wars fans alike.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build was quite a bit of fun, and took me a little over&nbsp;2 hours to complete; overall, I think the 9-14 age range appropriate. There is quite a bit of Technic used in this set - the first three bags consist primarily of Technic construction - but nothing too difficult&nbsp;as long as one pays attention. The construction of the two lift-arms, and seeing how they were covered up was most interesting. Building up the open traverse was fun as well.&nbsp;The construction of the aircraft body was mostly simple brick stacking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are a few stickers that need to be applied. The two stickers for the container door are slightly tricky, as they curve around the edge. The rest is placed on flat surfaces, therefore easy to apply. The background of the stickers is clear, as there is one massive sticker that has to be put on the front window. The two disks on the side are prints.</p>

<p>The mechanism to move the arms that connect to a container is rather intricate, but works OK.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are 5 minifigures included in this set, all of them unique, and of high quality: 2 Hylobon Enforcers, Qi&#39;Ra, Val and Rio Durant.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hylobon&nbsp;enforcers share the bodies - front and back print on the torso, and on the front upper legs - but have slightly different faces. The prints are crisp, and I like the silver and gold detailing on their uniforms.</p>

<p>Qi&#39;Ra&nbsp;has two face prints, and a nicely detailed print on the front and back of the torso. She wears a fur coat over something what looks like a uniform coat. The hair-piece is especially nice, and made of a soft rubber.</p>

<p>Val probably has the most impressive print on the torso (front and back), but especially on the legs. It is highly detailed, and shows her weighted down with zip-lines and climbing gear over a fur lined coat. The silver highlights look excellent, and overall this print looks in register. I am not sure what to make of her head and face prints. The feel as if they could come from a regular City figure. I like the afro hair piece.</p>

<p>Rio Durant is probably the most talked about minifigure, as he has a unique torso, with two pairs of arms. His torso print is impressive, especially on the front, depicting a highly detailed flight harness, with all kinds of belts and numerous small details. I like the goggle piece, which sits securely on his head. Well done by Lego.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Overall, I think the designer has done a very good job with this set. Not only is there a limited use of off-colour&nbsp;pieces, most of the ugly elements and Technic frame is nicely covered up - as it should be. Moreover, he seems to have paid attention to the colour&nbsp;of Technic pins, and whether they would end up being visible or not. I count only one element which I find inexcusable - and that is the red Technic bar in the rear. A brown bar would have been much better. and easily available (as they are already included in this set!).</p>

<p>I applaud the designer&#39;s choice to go for a mostly white vehicle, rather than greay. It makes for a much more interesting vehicle, and is still plausible. There is enough interesting texture. The one thing where I think things could have been approved is with some more detailing in the cockpit, and probably some more greebling&nbsp;on the roof-top.</p>

<h2>Play vd Display</h2>

<p>This set seems above all a big play set, since it is difficult to display the AT-Hauler in anything other than landing position. If one wants to display it in-flight, one has to build a stand. As a play set, it offers great swooshability, and even some self-defense weaponry (two stud shooters). A 9 year old should be able to swoosh it around (though it might need two hands). It biggest draw-back though is its weight, which is considerable. Thankfully it is all concentrated in the back. The pick-up mechanism that holds the containers takes a little practice to operate, but works well. There is a little place to put in the minifigures in the cockpit, but not for all of them - some will have to travel on the gantry.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this is a good set, and IMHO one of the better &#39;regular&#39; Star Wars sets of the past couple of years. I also like the choice for the AT-Hauler. In combination with the Conveyex&nbsp;Transport (set 75217) a big scene from the movie can be reproduced, and I am generally a fan of the Star Wars flying craft. I also like the choice for white as the primary colour. The vehicle seems to me a fair representation of the original, which is big, but not too big. The designer also has done a good job in hiding the Technic core of the arms, as well as putting together all the odd angles, without too many gaps. The minfigures are good, and I think also fair for a set this size. If there is one issue with this set, it is its price: somewhat overpriced, as most Star Wars sets seem to be these days. IMHO it is definitely worth looking for a discount.</p>
