"Karpo","2019-04-20T12:14:50.203Z","A surprise","<p>At first I was hesitant to purchase another Sandcrawler, I was (and still am) in awe of the 2014 75059 UCS version and thought why spend the money? So I sat on the fence for many months, then one day I was checking on LEGO sales and this was up there for a significant discount so I pulled trigger and bought it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the start of the build you realize the similarities and the differences. The track assemblies&nbsp;were one of the differences&nbsp;that&nbsp;I felt was tedious with the UCS version (which in&nbsp;the end was worth it).&nbsp;The revamp of this assembly was a nice change;&nbsp;it worked well and still appeared to look good. The designer made the outside look great, and as a bonus - no stickers.</p>

<p>The minifigs were a nice group, Luke and the Jawas&nbsp;were clean and crisp. But the exclusive droids were a welcome addition. Now don&#39;t get me wrong, I like R2-D2 and C-3P0 as much as the next person, but already owning plenty of&nbsp;these popular droids it was nice not to have 2 more. I like the new droids, R5-A2&#39;s&nbsp;orange/yellow&nbsp;head, 2-1B&#39;s weathered body, or the metallic RA-7 who makes me think of AP-7 from Rebels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was surprised by this set, I really didn&#39;t want another Sandcrawler&nbsp;but after finishing it, I was happy with it. I think that this is a solid buy for AFOLs and of course the 9-14 age group that it was designed for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My 4 year old son loved playing with this and so did I.&nbsp; The minifigs are ok.</p>

<p>I added the Mandalorian battle pack to replay some of the scenes from the latest star wars series on Disney+ for increased playability&nbsp;</p>

"Duskcosmog","2023-04-11T18:29:22.197Z","A good enough playset sandcrawler, but over-priced.","<p>This set is a smaller representation of the Sandcrawler. When you look at it you&#39;ll notice how small it is. The outside looks fine just a bit scaled down. The inside does look a bit cramped and gives off vibes that it was really just thrown together.</p>

<p>The playability is pretty good. You can fold and remove almost every single panel on the inside. It does have a good structure but some panels are brittle. The tread system works fine although sometimes it is a bit difficult. You can place a minfig in the Brige of the Sandcrawler so they can drive it. The crane arm is probably the best part of&nbsp;this set. Although it is small it has a large range of motion for you to pick up droids. For picking it up you can either use two hands and put one on top and one on the bottom, or you can grab it with one hand by grabbing it by to pillars on the side. The little Jawa cart is a good inclusion, and you also have two drums with you can do whatever you want with.</p>

<p>The minfigs are a bit lacking with only an R5 astromech, a medical Droid and, an RA-7 inventory Droid, two Jawas, and farmboy Luke. There should have been 2 more Jawas, and 2 more droids. Probably a Gonk Droid and a mouse droid.</p>

<p>Parts are good, with a lot of technic parts and tank tread pieces. There are brown, tan, and grey plates, hinges, and bricks. There are also some accent pieces like Trans yellow pieces for the wind shield, dark tan plates, and dark orange plates.</p>

<p>The building experience was pretty fun, with there being a lot of different parts like the technic frame, the outer shell plates, and the interior. The only repetitive part is the treads which you have to build 4 of.</p>

<p>For $140 this set does fill overpriced with how small the build is. It is also lacking minfigs for that price, although there was a battle pack at the time that you could get some Jawas and an Astromech. But they should&#39;ve just included the minifigs in this set.</p>

<p>My final thoughts are that this set is overpriced, too small, and lacking minifigs. If you don&#39;t have it then I suggest to not buy it.</p>
