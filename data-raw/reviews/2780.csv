I was only 4 or 5 years old, but I still remember the excitement of&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;this from my grandparents. Not too much to review here, it is what it is. A very basic introductory LEGO set. It did come with 1 mini figure, but there wasn't a lot of interaction between it and the LEGO bricks. The mini fig could not sit in the car, nor could it&nbsp;occupy&nbsp;the house if built as per the instructions. However, it was an excellent introduction into LEGO for me and I am still hooked to this day. After&nbsp;receiving&nbsp;this set, LEGO instantly became my favorite toy. The basic bright colors and countless options for building spawned decades of&nbsp;creativity&nbsp;for me. Thanks LEGO.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
