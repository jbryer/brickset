"Brick_Cuppy","2018-03-08T17:52:25.93Z","A Timless Tradition in Lego Form","<p>Many fans expressed disappointment when 21313 Ship in a Bottle was revealed, saying it was to small, to expensive, and not detailed enough. I thought it looked pretty good, if slightly on the expensive side because usually when there is large quantities of certain elements, it brings the cost down. Bulk is mostly cheap. But I loved the original project, and I loved the official set even more. Now that I own it, I can say it is better than the original model!</p>

<h2><strong>Box and Instructions:</strong></h2>

<p>The box is the usual IDEAS shoe-box style with the closing lid. It shows the Ship in a Bottle and a concept drawing lying on a table, while the background has a portal window set in white wooden boards. The back is similar, except this time looking through the portal window to the set with the ship outside the bottle. The 157-page instructions are of high-quality paper and came out unscathed, thankfully. There also is interviews with the fan and Lego designers, although it is rather brief. There is no sticker sheet, since most IDEAS sets only have printed details. In the other reviews I read, they said there were 7 bags of elements, 3 of which were filled with trans. light blue 1x1 round plates. However, my set came with only 6 bags - one of the 1x1 round plate bags was missing! So I counted the elements in the 2 bags I had, and found that all 284 of the trans. light blue pieces were there, so I am thinking there must have been a change in packaging sometime after the set was released. So if you find only 6 bags in your own set, don&#39;t worry! everything is there!</p>

<h2><strong>Parts:</strong></h2>

<p>The Ship in a Bottle contains many rare (under a dozen sets) and unique pieces, especially brown, dark orange, and transparent.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with listing the solid-color pieces (p.s. I prefer the name turquoise over teal, so I will be using that. It&#39;s the same thing as teal):</p>

<p>Now on to the transparent elements:</p>

<ul>
	<li>44 of transparent <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/3000840/plate-1x1-tr"">1x1 plate</a>,</li>
	<li>77 of transparent <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6240204/plate-1x2"">1x2 plate</a>, the most in any set.</li>

	<li>4 of <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=6002#T=S&amp;O={%22iconly%22:0}"">6x6x9 curved wall panel</a>, which was last seen in transparent in 2001. What with the return of turquoise, and the revival of new elements, 2018 is looking to be a great year!</li>
</ul>

<p>And finally the printed elements:</p>

<ul>
	<li>5 of white <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6231537/flag-w-2-holders-no-15"" style="""">flag w/ 2 clips</a>, printed with a red checkered design and sea-serpent insignia.</li>

	<li>2 of dark tan <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4633903/dome-%C3%B821-53-no-1"">half-globe</a>, printed with the earth map, and a pair of the other half of the world, of course.</li>
	<li>1 of red <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6229021/flat-tile-2x2-round-1108"">2x2 round tile</a>, printed with &quot;TC&quot;, in honor of Tiago Catarino, the set designer.</li>
	<li>1 of tan <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6228904/flat-tile-2x4-no-167"">2x4 tile</a>, printed with &quot;Leviathan&quot; nameplate.</li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s it. In the interview, Tiago Catarino says he tried to include as many turquoise(teal) elements as he could for interior structure. Thank you, Tiago! 21313 Ship in a Bottle is packed full of delightful parts, and I could almost recommend getting it just for them.</p>

<h2><strong>Build:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Bag 1:</strong> Builds the model ship. It was a very interesting and amazing build, with several different SNOT techniques used used achieve the curved hull. The sails were also very interesting, making good use of &quot;Apollo studs&quot; (aka 1x1 round plate w/ hollow stud) and <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4611100/mini-fig-back-plate-w-knob"">minifigure brackets</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>Bag 2:</strong> Builds most of the bottle. Here everything changes, as almost every piece is transparent! I have two recommendations when starting this section:&nbsp; 1. Wearing gloves (such as blue latex gloves, the kind used in first aid) is very helpful in handling transparent elements, so you don&#39;t get any finger prints or smudges on the bottle that would obstruct your view of the ship inside. It does make it harder to build, but it&#39;s worth it in the end.&nbsp; 2. Sorting by part in this section is extremely expedient, imagine searching through a pile of transparent elements for that one piece you need!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The build starts with the base, which is ingeniously built using transparent headlight bricks and plates. Next the build commences upwards using layers of transparent panels and plates. On one side you will construct a tall section with jumper plates connected to headlight bricks, used later to attach the model ship.</li>
	<li><strong>Bags 3:</strong> consists entirely of 284 1x1 trans. light blue round plates, and takes up one whole page of the instruction manual. Most peculiar!</li>
	<li><strong>Bags 4:</strong> Build the rest of the bottle and the base. And again we have monotony of color... this time brown. The base is slightly repetitive, but then most things are. Not quite as interesting as the first two bags( although a lot more than bag 3!), but by no means boring.</li>
</ul>

<p>Building the Ship in a Bottle was one of the most enjoyable building experiences I have ever had! It was challenging, but it was fun. This is the kind of stuff Lego fans live for.</p>

<h2><strong>Completed Model:</strong></h2>

<p><em><strong>the Ship:</strong></em> Is just brilliant. I&#39;m not entirely sure what type of ship it is, but I think it&#39;s a man o&#39; war. correct me if I&#39;m wrong. The leviathan ship is great, but I think that the original model ship was better, partly because it was bigger and had rigging. But since the designer had to down-scale the bottle, I think they they did a pretty good job. Dark orange was an interesting choice, I think because brown would blend with the display stand, but it still looks fine. It is a little fragile (especially the sails), but once in the bottle there is no chance of it breaking. I love the sails and the dark orange cladding, the gaps between the pieces look exactly like wooden boards. The cannons are really cute as well. The most amazing part is the one you can&#39;t see. The techniques used inside are brilliant, everything just seems to fit so perfectly. But I do think it could be curvier, and the back needs some more detail. So, it could be a lot better, but I think the designer did well considering the restrictions they have (stability, no illegal techniques, scarcity of dark orange parts, etc...). Really, it&#39;s only bad compared to the original.</p>

<p><em><strong>the Bottle:</strong></em> Is an amazing feat of Lego engineering! The official images don&#39;t do it justice. I thought the breaks in the transparency would render it a pretty pathetic bottle, but you barely notice them at all! If you took my advice and used gloves, then you should come out with a beautiful, spotless whiskey bottle. The base would be a feat in itself, considering it&#39;s complexity and the fact it is composed of only 6 different types of elements, even if it wasn&#39;t entirely transparent! Some people complain about the two windows in the base, but I like them because they provide a view of the stern of the ship.The bottle stopper is not quite the same in complexity, but certainly in looks. The gold matches that on the display stand, and the wax seal is a delightful detail. Surprisingly, the bottle is my favorite part of this set!</p>

<p><em><strong>the Display Stand:</strong></em> is, though seemingly simple, full of surprises. From the turquoise(aka teal) elements to be found inside, to the SNOT techniques used to create the smooth roundness, to the hidden compass underneath the bottle. I really like the compass. in an interview I read, Mark Tranter, the graphic designer, said they had trouble printing the compass on the concave face of the 6x6 parabola, so they printed it upside-down on the convex side so it would show through! They used the same technique on 10253 Big ben in 2016 for the clocks. The two earth globes on either end complete the nautical look, and you have a simply beautiful display stand!</p>

<p>Comparing it to Jacob Sadovich&#39;s <a href=""https://ideas.lego.com/projects/eca1b08b-1b29-46a6-97a1-9b2580e1dce2"">original </a><a href=""https://ideas.lego.com/projects/eca1b08b-1b29-46a6-97a1-9b2580e1dce2"">model</a>, his model ship is quite a bit better, but the official set&#39;s bottle is more accurately sized to a real ship in a bottle, and the display stand is superior to to the original as well. Well done to Jacob for creating a brilliant project, and well done Lego designers for turning it into a stunning set!</p>

<h2><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></h2>

<p>21313 Ship in a Bottle is an excellent set! Awesome parts, a challenging and amazing build, and a beautiful model to stand proudly on your desk or shelf. A bit expensive, but still worth it. Highly recommended!</p>

"Zeke_Nitron","2018-08-27T14:45:10.913Z","Beautiful Ship Display piece","<p>This is probably in the top 20 best Lego sets to put on display. The stand, Bottle, and ship all have great designs. The display part of the set&nbsp;is 10/10. I will admit that building it was a strain, especially&nbsp;trying to get the ship to stay in the bottle. Other than that its great. For the people that are in it for the pieces, there are lots of trans-blue studs, flag prints, and two globes.</p>

"Fazgrl","2019-01-08T19:20:33.917Z","Distinctive, fun, a real showpiece","<p>I enjoyed making this - it was distinctive and different. Would love the ship to have a little more detail. But their is one glaring fault and that is the neck of the bottle is very hard to attach securely to the flimsy top of the bottle. But its a real showpiece, and has already garnered a lot of attention from my sons 20 year old friends!</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-01T21:40:09.857Z","A very displayable Fan designed set","<p>This is a very cool set but not because of playability but because of its displayability. It allows you to take the miniturature ship out of the bottle and play with that though. The stand for the bottle is very detaled with exclusive printing on the globe pieces and a map of th Earth, which is very nice and the stand holds the bottle nicely. The bottle has large clear curved pieces that are very expensive to manufacture, which adds value to the set. There are 100 light blue studs that you put at the bottom of the bottle to represent water. The ship its self is not bad and can be removed from the bottle by removing the top. The cork at the front is very detailed with the LEGO designers initials on the seal but it would have been cooler to have the fan designers initials on the seal because this is a LEGO Ideas set which was origionally designed by a fan. Over all I woud recommend this set to anyone who wants a LEGO set for a display piece on their desk or a shelf in a office/study at home.</p>

"lego_collector_123","2019-05-15T08:02:28.887Z","Set sail on the seven seas! ","<p>This set is my first lego ideas set and I&#39;m keen to get more. Lego ideas offers more sets that are unique and it&#39;s great to get a link between the designers and the lego community. The final model is quite different from the original fan&nbsp;submission&nbsp;and I&nbsp;like aspects of both. The main change is the size, the original has ~1,800 pieces and the finished product has&nbsp;only 962.</p>

<p>The first section of the set that you build is the ship, I&nbsp;like the colour scheme of dark orange, tan, and brown, with gold highlights. I&nbsp;also appreciate how the sides of the ship&nbsp;are built with studs on the side construction to create&nbsp;rounded shape. Details like the&nbsp;steering wheel and cannons look especially great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next you build the bottle. The cork stopper has a nice build and I&nbsp;like the printed wax seal. This part of the build&nbsp;relies&nbsp;on large clear pieces which allow you to see the ship easily through them. I&nbsp;don&#39;t like the bottom of the bottle which is built using small headlight bricks and 1x1 cheese slopes which creates a very distorted effect&nbsp;(like a stain glass window), but it has two square windows in the centre that you can see through them easily. I&nbsp;don&#39;t like the way the two&nbsp;styles work together, if it had only used the small bricks (not the windows) then it wouldn&#39;t have looked so odd.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally you make the stand which looks fantastic and holds the bottle well. The sign displaying the ships name is a custom printed tile the reads &quot;leviathan&quot;. The two pieces used to make the globes&nbsp;of the world look amazing and help frame the ship. But the biggest surprise to me is the printed radar dish showing a compass which looks great considering that the bottle covers it so you don&#39;t see it most of the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set makes for a great display model while not taking up too much shelf space, and the price of $120 aud for ~1,000 parts (admittedly many of them are small)&nbsp;make for a good price.</p>

"Amfaprincess","2020-11-30T16:10:21.377Z","Build then leave on display","<p>This set is flawed. I had three brown 2x4 bricks split when I was taking it apart to rebuild (for fun)! Lego were contacted and shipped replacements. When I went to rebuild it, I found another piece that had cracked but I fixed that with Krazy Glue. I recommend build it the once, then leave it on display for eternity.</p>
