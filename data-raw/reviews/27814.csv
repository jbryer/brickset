<p>Let us discuss the minifigures. Usually, the LEGO&reg; Creator 3 in 1 set with this size only provides 2 minifigures (one adult and one child). But this set is quite generous by providing 3 minifigures which is the owner of the confectionery and two children minifigure.</p>

<p>As you can see, the children minifigure have dual expressions while the adult minifigure only has single expression. The girl minifigure has happy wide smile expression and smile with closed eyes expression.</p>

<p>While, the boy minifigure has wide smile expression and queasiness expression. Well, maybe the boy had eaten too much confectionery and now he feels queasy by it.</p>

<p>This LEGO&reg; set has a colourful combination that identical with confectionery. In the top left corner, there is a signage depicting a huge cupcake, a pie, and two croissants so people can identify the store from afar. The signage has an axle so you can turn the signage to face whichever direction you want. On the front side there are various of cupcakes displayed on turntable for the customer to see.</p>

<p>In the top left corner, there is a balcony that can be used by the customer to sit down and enjoy the confectionery. Below it, there is an ATM to be used by customers to withdraw the cash to buy the confectionery. There is also a gumball machine for the children to use.</p>

<p>You can find an oven to bake the pastry, chiller for the ice cream and cashier to make the payment. There is a yellow umbrella that I do not know what the purpose of it since it does not shade the nearby window.</p>

<p>As you can see, the lower back side of this set is exposed like on LEGO&reg; City or Friends sets. This is very unfortunate since the recent LEGO&reg; Creator sets has exposed back side such as set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31080-1/Modular-Winter-Vacation"">31080 - Modular Winter Vacation</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31081-1/Modular-Skate-House"">31081 - Modular Skate House</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31097-1/Townhouse-Pet-Shop-Caf%C3%A9"">31097 - Townhouse Pet Shop &amp; Cafe</a>, or <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31105-1/Townhouse-Toy-Store"">31105 - Townhouse Toy Store</a>. As a person that prioritise details of the building, this issue is disappointing for me. But of course this issue can be resolved by placing the set next to existing wall or by modifying the set with your own wall design.</p>

<p>For Creator 3 in 1 set I usually only build the main build since the second and third builds left me with significant left over parts, and they look less majestic. So I do not review the alternate build versions.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>It is fun to build this set. Especially since I build a LEGO City, I always welcome more shop&nbsp;for my city.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>More parts should be provided to wall off the backside of the shop.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Children will enjoy this set and adult will love a variety of shop on their city setup or collection.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>Again, this is kind of relative. I got this set at a bargain price. So the value for money is great to me. As usual, my advice is to always buy LEGO at discounted price whenever you can.</p>

<p><strong>Special Note</strong></p>

<p>This set can be combined with Friends <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/41119-1/Heartlake-Cupcake-Cafe"">41119 - Heartlake Cupcake Cafe</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/41366-1/Olivia-s-Cupcake-Cafe"">41366 - Olivia&#39;s Cupcake Cafe</a>&nbsp;to have a variety of cupcake stores in your city setup! (Well if you like to mix and match sets from different themes).</p>

<p>Please note that I write this review based on my own LEGO Blog article which is available from:&nbsp;h<a href=""https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-set-review-31077-modular-sweet-surprise"">ttps://indobrickville.com/main/lego-set-review-31077-modular-sweet-surprise</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this insight from me will be useful for all AFOLs out there!</p>
