"Brentski","2019-01-24T22:28:21.917Z","Take me on a sea cruise","<p>The primary build for this set is the focus of this review.</p>

<p>The build took about two hours in two sessions. Like all 3 in 1&#39;s, the bags aren&#39;t numbered, which can make the parts search irritating the first time around. Can be done faster, depending on your preferred speed.</p>

<p>The ship was fun to build, I have a focus on beach/water themes. The extra parts/accessories are pretty good. The three minifigs&nbsp;are perfect for the set. The small sand castle is a great addition.</p>

<p>The palm tree is a bit loose, it does not set well.</p>

<p>The value is ok, I got this on sale at Walmart. I believe the full retail price makes the value a little lower.</p>

<p>The playability of this set is good.</p>

<p>A set that may not be for everyone, but a must have for water lovers.</p>

The minifigures are nice and they fit the set and the side builds are amazing the jet ski is one that is in my MOC same as the little beach build. If my MOC had more space I would definitely add this to it. Its value still holds up today even better than ever. I wish to buy more of this set mainly because of the other build I can make.</p>

<p>thanks for reading!</p>
