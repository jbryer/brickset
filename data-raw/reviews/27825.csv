It is common in sets that are $50 or more and it is extremely&nbsp;useful. Even with knowing all of this, i was surprised&nbsp;when I saw the pictures of this set. It seemed like an odd, but a pleasant choice.</p>

<p>It seems like the LEGO&reg; Group just took a regular Brick Separator&nbsp;and punched a hole in it and stuck a key chain on. This is perfectly fine and I am ok with it. Now if anyone goes to a LEGO convention and needs to take something apart real quick, they they can just pull out their keys and use this.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a fun little keychain, but it may not be for everyone. It is a cool little thing to carry around, but you won&#39;t use it to often if you don&#39;t participate in regular LEGO conventions of places like that.</p>
