Being a fan of the DB5 car in Goldfinger I was glad Lego put play features in the set from the James Bond films such as the amazingly well designed ejector seat. the prime problem&nbsp;of this set is the exclusion of a James Bond figure, but to me it&rsquo;s only&nbsp;a minor problem. The biggest issue of the set though is the price of 149.99 us, which to me is about ten dollars more then it should&rsquo;ve been. The play features though are one of the best parts of the set, such as the revolving license plates, the spiked tires, hidden guns, phone, gps system, and the best feature, the ejector seat which was done fantastically in my opinion with the opening roof and use of Technic. Overall I think this is a fine piece to a collection and would suggest it to anyone who likes Lego expert or James Bond.</p>

The only problem I had was a couple missing pieces, no big deal I had extras from other sets. And the hidden functions required a bit of fiddling and disassembly to make work. Get it if you&rsquo;re a Bond fan, and who cares about the price.</p>

"Marlon8000","2019-03-24T18:40:54.71Z","Shaken, not stirred","<p>Being an old time Bond fan from the Roger Moore era, I really needed to buy this set... It was like I couldn&#39;t help myself... This set made me buy it... Here we go!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The box:</strong></p>

<p>The front of the box shows the Aston Martin seen on the front left side, on a background&nbsp;that looks like&nbsp;the &quot;from inside the barrel of a gun&quot; view. You know, when Bond shoots at the screen and blood drips down.</p>

<p>Top left corner shows the LEGO Creator logo, 16+, Set number 10262, and the set name. The top right corner shows the Expert Level logo. On the right bottom corner there are the 007, and the Aston Martin logo.</p>

<p>The backside of the box shows the DB5 seen on the rear right side, with opened doors hood and trunk. To the left and on top are 5 detail pictures that show functionalities.&nbsp; On the bottom right there are also the 007 logo and the Aston Martin logo, like on the front.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The content of the box:</strong></p>

<p>The 1290 parts are packed in 12&nbsp;bags: 3x bags 1, 3x bags 2, 3x bags 3, and 2x bags 4. The wheels are in a separated bag together with a red long axle connector.</p>

<p>The instructions booklet is sealed in together with the sticker sheet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The instructions booklet:</strong></p>

<p>The booklet is actually pretty cool... it looks like the folder with the &quot;For Your Eyes Only&quot; ribbon... Too bad it also says&nbsp;&quot;Rien Que Pour Vos Veux&quot;...&nbsp;for your eyes only in French. I think...</p>

<p>The book has 171 pages and 263 steps. The first 9 pages are about James Bond, The DB5, and their history. After the building steps, there is the opportunity to let LEGO know how you feel about this build, and the last 2 pages is the parts list.</p>

<p>The information pages are in English and French... for some reason...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bags 1:</strong></p>

<p>The bags numbered 1 will build the back of the chassis, the floor plate, which is pretty straight forward for a car this size...Also the mechanism for the eject seat is build... Also, the gear changer has a connection rod to the front, not sure what it is going to do.</p>

<p>It gets a bit technical, not too difficult, but on some moments it was not immediately clear how parts needed to go in.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bags 2:</strong></p>

<p>With the parts from bags 2 you will build the front of the chassis, the backsides and the doors of the Aston Martin.&nbsp;The backside has a chrome bumper in which the lever for the seat eject is build in. you pull the middle chrome part. The right door has a hidden compartment that has a phone in it. In the cockpit there is&nbsp;the globe like navigation screen&nbsp; Small minor detail is that the steering wheel is not precisely centered to the seat.</p>

<p>The car starts to take shape. The side panels and doors are quick builds, and so far not a boring build at all.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bags 3</strong></p>

<p>The front of the body, the engine, its all pretty straight forward. The chrome strips in front of the doors is a nice touch. Just as the rotating license plates. &nbsp;What is pretty cool&nbsp;are the headlights that change to machine guns operated bij the gear changer. Awesome!</p>

<p>Despite the straight forwardness on some moments, still not boring... and it is becoming quite the technical set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bags 4</strong></p>

<p>Bags 4 will finish the build... The hood looks great and has an air intake. The hood opens by moving a little towards the windshield, and opens on hinges on the front. These hinges have quite some friction so the hood stays in whatever position you want. The rear window is mounted by SNOT technique (studs to the back).</p>

<p>Just behind the rear window, there is a bulletproof shield that comes up out of the booth. The shield fits very well with the trunk lid, but the mechanism is not the best. The shield comes up very well, but then it locks up and does not come down without wiggling it a bit, Still a cool feature.</p>

<p>The lid of the trunk is made of 2 parts and it also has the rotating license plates.</p>

<p>The roof is a solid construction with a trapdoor for the eject seat... pulling the bumper part makes the roof pop open, and releasing the bumper part shoots the seat up... Works great</p>

<p>And finally, the wheels go on... Standard rims in chrome, but with chrome spoke wheels. Together with the single wing nut mount, looks really cool. (There are NO spare&nbsp;wingnuts in this set).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The finished build:</strong></p>

<p>The finished DB5 looks great, it is a bit longer than I expected. Also, it took a little less time than I thought... it took a little less than 5 hours, while, for me. 8 to 10 hours is normal for a set like this (Please note, these are my timings, your experience may differ).</p>

<p>There is a lot of functionality... even more than some Technic sets I have. This is what makes this set very much fun to build. The mechanisms are way less complicated as you&#39;d expect... Genius by simplicity lol.</p>

<p>The instructions are clear enough, sometimes it is needed to pay a bit more attention, or take an extra good look to see where a part exactly goes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Should I get this set?</strong></p>

<p>If you are a bond fan, YESSS!!!!&nbsp; if not, it&#39;s still a great set. The higher than average functionality jacks up the playability.</p>

<p>Also great parts... Light gray bricks&nbsp;are always good. I personally like the chrome parts and brown tinted windows, and the spoke wheels and wingnuts look great on any old timer MOC (Spoke wheels are only in this set, the wingnuts are in 16 different sets). And it looks good in the overall Creator-fleet</p>

<p>But most of all... Very Bond-worthy... Great job LEGO!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Thank you for reading :-)</strong></p>

"sstruk","2018-08-02T10:02:19.447Z","Martin, Aston Martin","<p>As a huge fan of old 007, as soon as this set was announced I knew I&rsquo;d buy it as soon as it hit the shelves, and so it was. Build experience is great (at least for most of it). I&rsquo;d say best part of it all is how ejection seat is constructed and triggered &ndash; just brilliant. All the &ldquo;hidden&rdquo; features are easy to use (maybe a bit of a struggle to rotate radar into view). My biggest remark is use of stickers on a 150$ set. I would expect at least to have few parts printed with logo on it (as it was case with Caterham set). &nbsp;All in all, great set for any 007 fan out there, non-fans will most likely be put off by the price tag.</p>

<p>Pros: ejection seat, rear shield, rotating plates, build experience overall</p>

<p>Cons: use of stickers, front hood not easy to open, engine gets detached in the bay too often, price</p>

"pjgtech","2018-12-29T20:04:37.333Z","007 Aston Martin DB5 Very good set","<p>Wow, what a great set this was, took me all of a long day, about 8&nbsp; hours to build, but it is a very satisfying build. All the features are there from the Bond movies, ejector seat, which even flings to seat out of the car, bullet proof shield, rotating number plates, wheel cutters, machine guns behind the lights, revolving interior dash, secret phone compartment, etc.</p>

<p>The only negative was that a few pieces were missing, mainly thin grey strips for the bonnet and roof, and the only other thing was that i could not get the rear bullet proof shield to go up and down, it seemed to be catching on something, but this was probably due to me misunderstanding the instructions or something?</p>

<p>NB: This is a very technical build, with lots of complicated mechanical bits to complete to get all the gizmos working, but its well worth the hard technical build when its completed, see youtube clip here:&nbsp; &nbsp;https://youtu.be/si0JXhM3lm4</p>

<p>I highly recommend this set, its a really good one. Thanx</p>

"boneskull","2019-12-25T18:37:25.217Z","Impressive Build","<p>This build contains more tricks&nbsp;than just about any set I&#39;ve built in recent memory. That alone makes me want to give it 5 stars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you&#39;re expecting&nbsp;for a true-to-life&nbsp;&quot;model&quot;, this set isn&#39;t necessarily that. It&#39;s a James Bond spy car!&nbsp;Sure, it&#39;s roughly a DB5, but it&#39;s all about the gadgets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The gadgets: they are neat, and the kids like them--but the build is flimsy in some areas (headlights especially) and this reduces its playability. The car can not be turned either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Given it&#39;s&nbsp;licensed, you aren&#39;t gonna get your best bang-for-buck here--but if you want to learn a few techniques, check this one out.&nbsp;</p>

"c05","2021-03-07T09:20:38.237Z","Excellent value, beautiful design, clunky play features","<p>As far as pure bang-for-your-buck, this is quite possibly the best deal in Lego, especially as far as the adult collector sets are concerned. $150 for a highly detailed, sleek build with a ton of parts is right in that sweet spot, especially compared to something like the Batmobile which is a bit less elegant but costs way more.</p>

<p>The build itself is very enjoyable, and captures the iconic car&#39;s form well. This set leans into SNOT techniques perhaps harder than any other official set I&#39;ve seen and the sleek lines give the car a very clean&nbsp;look. Sticker usage is mercifully tasteful and well justified, so the sticker-averse probably won&#39;t mind this too much. The instruction manual is also beautifully done, presented as a dossier to Bond himself and loaded with history about the films and the car. Every aspect of this package is premium and you can really feel the love and care that went into it in every step.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the much-touted play features are somewhat clunky. To start, the doors almost always hitch and don&#39;t close smoothly. The license plate on the front feels difficult to rotate and while it is by design that it kind of clicks into each spin, I feel like doing so over time will wear out the licence stickers. Most disappointingly, the ejector seat is very unreliable. They have it sitting on a particularly long axle to stay in place, and while it does launch impressively far when you do actually get it to launch, I feel like the length of the axle combined with the tightness of the space the chair is supposed to sit in causes the chair to frequently fail to even move. I think replacing the axle with a shorter one would probably go a long way in helping it launch.</p>

<p>That said, this is still a pretty interactive set and there are a number of things that work very well. I love that you can pop both the hood and the trunk and actually have something to look at inside. The hood has a cleverly detailed engine that uses pistols as tubes, and the trunk contains the arms for the tire-spikes incase you want the car to look like it&#39;s in attack mode. The headlights also pivot into machine guns which works beautifully and the bullet shield is a simple, but effective mechanism that works nicely.</p>

<p>Despite my gripes with the function, this is really a fantastic display piece and a steal for the price. If you even remotely like James Bond or even just classic cars in general, this is a no brainer and a must-have.</p>

"Karidian","2021-04-26T05:24:57.477Z","Technical Build for a Newbie","<p>This was the most challenging and technical build so far for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only my 4th LEGO build and I jumped right in on this one.&nbsp;&nbsp; Worked on this over the course of 3-4 days.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was interesting to see it come together and how all the special features were done.&nbsp;&nbsp; The ejection seat sort of works, the seat popped up, and then fell right back into the car.&nbsp; Everything else works, but the flipping licence plates do stick as you try to turn them around.&nbsp; Attaching the roof on the drivers side was precarious and required several tries before everything stayed in place as shone in the directions.&nbsp;&nbsp; Would have felt better if not so many parts were in each numbered bag to not overwhelm a newbie builder with so much to do at once or parts to sort through.&nbsp;&nbsp; I tend to take a break after completing a bag set, so that would have helped in my case to avoid the build from becoming tedious over a longer stretch of time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I thought the instruction book as &quot;Classified-For Your Eyes Only&quot; was a cool touch and the info on the build and car was interesting.&nbsp;&nbsp; Had no missing parts, and the completed build does look nice.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is somewhat blocky looking, and will serve more as a display piece than to be played with the special features.&nbsp;&nbsp; This was not a kit I had anticipated buying, but after seeing the video on it on the LEGO website my husband and i changed our minds and decided to add it to our collection.&nbsp;&nbsp; I built this one and felt it was a good value for the money for the end result.</p>
