It features a nice light brick effect and some very old school design aesthetic for small town fire houses. This set looks great, and much like the other Creator Expert sets I picked up in the past few years this was a very solid build experience. Definitely a great set and here&rsquo;s why that is.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">LEGO used to make decent packaging, the new Adult based boxes seem very bland to me. This particular design features a nice cool blue theme similar in shade to the Harry Potter sets. The box front showcases the set nicely with a very cute winter scene in the background showing snow and trees and stars everywhere, very tranquil and pristine. Compared to the sets of 2020 and the new design, yeah, this is one time I don&rsquo;t think they should have changed the design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">You&rsquo;ll find two numbered manuals in this set based on the numbered bag build approach, the first manual is for everything in Bag 1 and the second is for the remaining bags for the main model. Also included was a sticker sheet for some of the detailing aspects of the model. As with other sets of this style the instructions are easy to follow with for experienced builders, younger builders may require assistance in some areas.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set features a load of dark red, tan, white, black and green. You&rsquo;ll find many bricks, plates, some ladder, a staircase and lamp post. A brick separator is also included. I wouldn&rsquo;t say these are decent parts packs, but they&rsquo;re definitely loaded with elements in colours that can be useful to MOC fans. So definitely good for parting out.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Baby: This Mini-Minifigure includes a new print with a Reindeer and snowflakes on his jumper. He or She looks very cute, it&rsquo;s a very impressive figure.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Citizen 1: This young girl is wearing a scarf in light orange. This part was introduced in The LEGO Ninjago Movie and still has yet to be cast in a different colour. Most of the parts are common on her which we&rsquo;ve seen before in LEGO sets. None of these Minifigures are unique in print aside from the Baby and possibly the Firefighters, but they do look very impressive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Citizen 2: Our ice skating friend is wearing a dark grey beanie and carrying a hockey stick while wearing skates. His face appears rather young for an adult, but that&rsquo;s not unusual in LEGO. He also includes a hockey puck using a single stud with hole in it, unfortunately this likes to fall off the ice pond a little too easily as it slides around easily.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Citizen 3: This fellow looks like a Fire Chief at first, but is actually a festive musician dressed in a fancy suit and tie, some green epaulets and a black officer&rsquo;s cap, he carries a saxophone and regales everyone with festive carols. Definitely a very fun Minifigure.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Firefighter 1: This grizzled old veteran of the force is dressed in the same uniform as his peers, a plain black pair of legs with a button printed black vest. He includes a golden firefighter helmet and a spare set of grey hair to swap out. His buddy the Dalmatian tags along using an old LEGO dog element which doesn&rsquo;t quite match the build of a Dalmatian. Perhaps someday LEGO CMF will finally make a unique mold for Dalmatians.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Firefighter 2: Our lovely firefighting officer has a large head of hair made famous by LEGO Black Widow. She comes with a spare golden firefighter helmet and is dressed in the exact same uniform as her companion.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Firefighter 3: This gentleman dressed in the same outfit as the others has a lightish blond male hair piece which is parted along one side. There&rsquo;s nothing else much to say, he has the same uniform as his fellow fire persons and so there you go.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Firefighter Statue: This monochrome statue is all grey except for the gold helmet on its head, it carries a grey lightsaber hilt with water pouring out. It sits on the plinth at the ice pond, a very fun addition.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: The build in this bag involves most of the Minifigures and everything constructed as additional scenery to display alongside the Fire Station, each build is therefore quick and relatively easy to complete and for multiple builders working on the same set you can have somebody start with this while another works on the main build with Bag #2. The tree is standard LEGO Christmas Tree faire as you construct it in typical tree building techniques.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The minor builds are very quick with a sled and a toy wagon. The frozen pond is also very quick and the only tricky portion of the build is placing all of the tiles properly so they line up correctly to form the ice covered water.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The fire engine build is classic and quite enjoyable. Everything in this bag will be finished relatively quickly, the only steps that may cause problems, as noted above are the ice tiles.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: A single Minifigure joins the group as you begin constructing the main model, this is the lower section of the fire station and as such includes small areas to build alongside the large doors and garage entrance where the fire engine resides when not in use. This is a very engaging and solid build, though some of the work requires a hard surface to start off on so as to avoid easy plates separating while constructing. There&rsquo;s a lot of layering to make details and higher sections of ground and the main entrance features some columns which are very well designed. A solid build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: A firefighter helps build the second floor of the station in this bag, some sticker placement will be used for details while the rest are handled with brick and plate building. We also find a lot of familiar building design choices here from Creator Expert level buildings. I should also mention that once I reached the end of the build I discovered a missing piece, one of the red bricks was missing preventing me from completing the build until a replacement could be sent from LEGO. Highly disappointing. You also use the light brick in the build here to attach to the roof.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Christmas Scenery: This is primarily a Christmas Tree and a small iced over pond. Under the tree are two presents, a wrapped gift and a toy train potentially made out of wood judging by the use of light tan bricks. Another toy cart is present, this is a blue wheeled cart with a steering wheel, the baby can ride it as well as others.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Speaking of which we also have a sled with a present on it that the baby can also ride, the iced over pond is a flat surface with some gold detailing and a plinth where a statue of a Firefighter is standing. There is a lot that can be said of this, but it&rsquo;s a nice set piece. Last, but certainly not least we have a little bench area with a decorated street lamp, this is a great little side-build that works perfectly for adding some nice scenery to your Winter Village display.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Fire Truck: This little fire truck is a small two person emergency vehicle, one person drives while the canine sits beside him and a second fire fighter can ride on the ladder. This evokes the classic design and look of older model fire engines used in small towns and villages, and so is an excellent model to have for the Winter Village theme. It does not carry water, but hoses to attach to fire plugs as well as a toolbox and some tools for emergency repairs or rescues. Overall a very solid model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Fire Station: The exterior is full of excellent detail work with a snowman and some very nicely build main garage doors. There&rsquo;s a flag on the roof and many very impressive greebling effects. The outside is nicely designed and fun, but it is the interior where all of the impressive play features can be found.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">On the main floor off to the side of the building is an entrance for people, this allows access to the garage where some fire extinguishers and tools are kept for getting into buildings when they are on fire, an axe and a pick-axe. A printed clock tile rests on the wall and the large doors open onto a blank space where the engine can fit, but there are no plates here. You&rsquo;ll have to add your own road plates I guess.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Climbing the stairs on the outside in the front allows access to the top floor where you will find a kitchen area, a phone, some nice windows, the upper area for the sliding pole, a small area where the dog can rest, a flip down upper bunk bed for a firefighter to sleep on and an eating area where you can sit two firefighters to eat. On the table is a hot dog and coffee mug.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Everything is built with bricks and looks great. The light brick function lights up the window and that&rsquo;s about it, it&rsquo;s placement is decent enough, but does seem to be a bit weaker compared to the gingerbread house I reviewed previously.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with the other Winter Themed Creator Expert I purchased and reviewed previously I am highly impressed with the construction and design of this set. The building seems slightly smaller with less space inside for all of the figures, but in all honesty it makes sense. This is a village fire station, not some modern massive building like some of the LEGO City fire stations. I enjoyed building and displaying this wonderful set and would highly recommend tracking one down for your holiday themed LEGO display. Smashingly brilliant set. Highly Recommended.</p>
