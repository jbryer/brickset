"scolioreset","2018-05-05T10:55:28.147Z","""We're starting our building run... Our attack run!""","<p>7150... That&#39;s all I&#39;m gonna say first. If you search it in the LEGO database, you&#39;ll understand. 7150: TIE Fighter &amp; Y-Wing was one of my very first LEGO sets and, at the time, had&nbsp;a personal value. When I had to move, I&#39;ve had to eventually give away my small LEGO collection. Of course, I was disappointed but I grew up and eventually was able to make my own money. TLDR: I owned the original rendition of the Y-Wing starfighter&nbsp;in LEGO form.</p>

<p>With 75181: Y-Wing Starfighter&nbsp;finally out, this is something I&#39;ve had to get my hands on. The main reason is because I can appreciate LEGO designs and larger models to a degree. I appreciate Star Wars as well and some starfighters impress me more than others. The attention to detail is what I generally want out of LEGO sets. I also seek authenticity which is why I can also appreciate playsets.&nbsp;Of course, because I owned the original LEGO Y-Wing, there is a nostalgic appeal. This is the sixth rendition of the Gold Squadron&#39;s Y-Wing Starfighter including the original UCS back from 2004 across 19 years of LEGO Star Wars.</p>

<p>For those uninitiated to Star Wars, the Y-Wing Starfighter is a bomber-type assault spaceship. You probably have seen it by watching footage or pictures from the original Star Wars movie trilogy as well as Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. The Y-Wing was mainly used by the&nbsp;Gold Squadron in the original movie and Rogue One and was piloted by Jon &quot;Dutch&quot; Vander, the Gold Leader from the original movie AND Rogue One. The Y-Wing was also featured in most media forms, especially video games such as Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader.</p>

<p>If you are interested in this set, the next sections may be filled with spoilers. If you wish the keep the surprise for yourself, avoid all time-lapse videos or building streams and buy the set if you can afford it. There are many construction techniques and you may want to see them on your own and discover them as you go through the building process.</p>

<p><em>Full disclosure: I did buy the set at release for the retail price in Canada. It took me around 5-6 hours with in-between breaks.</em></p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Thanks to the 75192 - Millennium Falcon, the 2nd UCS set from 2017, second rendition of the UCS Falcon and 6th version of the vehicle from the original/sequel trilogy... the Y-Wing Starfighter benefits from the luxury of the new box style and a special white box containing several numbered bags. The retail box itself looks incredible and is a call back to the Death Star trench run. The back of the retail box displays the Y-Wing in a rebel hangar and it also demonstrates some of the functions such as the landing skates or the ion cannons. Because this isn&#39;t your usual playset, the &quot;bombing&quot; function isn&#39;t possible as you might imagine.</p>

<p>This is my first UCS Star Wars set so I can finally appreciate the designer&#39;s insights from Jordan David Scott as well as graphical designer Madison O&#39;Neil. We get to see several sketches and production pictures for the original Star Wars movies. From Jordan David Scott&#39;s point of view, this Y-Wing is a combination of everything that happened in the original trilogy and Rogue One and the sketches served up to get the maximum of detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While there are symmetrical builds, specifically the general structure of the pylons, most of the instructions have been pretty difficult to follow due to the amount of greeblings&nbsp;across the entire set. I&#39;ve had to really take note of which piece was using the &quot;metal&quot; tint instead of the gray or light gray. The manual does feel heavy for me but well-structured. It isn&#39;t filled with product placement except at the end and solely focuses on the presented product.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two minifigures are included in this set. R2-BHD&nbsp;is a strange addition but this astromech&nbsp;droid is from Rogue One and based on the visual guide, this droid was assigned to the Gold Squadron and generally flew with Jon &quot;Dutch&quot; Vander. As you might guess, Vander is the Gold Leader presented in this set. Unfortunately, the helmet isn&#39;t representative of the gear used by the Canadian&nbsp;actor Angus MacInnes&nbsp;despite the prints being much closer to the actual movie prop. The face is also the same headpiece used for most Rebel pilots including the 75144: Snowspeeder&nbsp;which means that the &quot;neutral&quot; figure in 9495 from 2012 is nowhere to be seen. The torso and leg prints are also reused from the Microfighter set 75032: X-Wing but is the most updated design for a Rebel space pilot as the Y-Wing pilot in the Rogue One set used a totally different set of prints.</p>

<p>Regardless, both minifigures&nbsp;have excellent printed details which is excellent. On a collection&#39;s perspective, I do believe LEGO should start taking notes and try to make some faces look closer to the actors. I&#39;m already expecting much more if Wedge Antilles were to reappear in LEGO form... but he also had the &quot;pilot head&quot; syndrome in 75098: Assault on Hoth which is a set that most UCS fans wish to forget... same for the LEGO company as this set is already discontinued while the 75060: UCS Slave I is STILL on the market, three years after its initial retail release.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>What surprised me the most is how some of the parts were divided across the bags. It took two bags to finish the canopy with the top of the cabin being its own segment. The two engines had their own separated bags (across 6 bags, two 9 and and two 10). While I can understand due to the symmetrical aspect, it was strange for me. Obviously, the stand had its own bag.</p>

<p>Regarding the pieces, this is a mix of large and many... MANY small pieces and this is due to the greebling&nbsp;across the entire set. The largest pieces are, of course, the ones used at the end of the pylons which ends up justifying the asking price... if you&#39;re in the US or the UK for example. Being slightly above 10 cents per piece, you&#39;ll have to pay at least 12 cents per piece in Canada and that&#39;s excluding taxes. Considering the production cost, the trademark, the employees, the package, the instructions, the graphics... the price can easily be justified but as with ALL sets labeled as UCS, you&#39;ll be paying quite the significant price.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>This is why I appreciate the UCS since 76023: The Tumbler. The building experience was phenomenal. At first, I wasn&#39;t too sure where the initial parts would lead to. Placing the greeblings, it started to make a little more sense based on the marketing photos and the package. This is a set that you don&#39;t want to lose pieces because of them are small and help with the greeblings&nbsp;and overall details and shape for the product. The overall build becomes extremely fragile as it goes because you eventually flip it down to place more details as you clip some bars or assemble the landing skates.</p>

<p>I do wish the stand would have been placed a little ahead since I didn&#39;t appreciate holding the set to place the pylons or even the canopy. I was afraid to break it apart but everything went pretty well. Placing the stickers is definitely a terrible experience and I wish, sincerely, that it would eventually stop. I can understand for control panels but for pieces that make up the main exposed parts (the canopy), I think it&#39;s time to let go off the stickers and make printed pieces again. I&#39;m sure the LEGO team can afford such a change. Most stickers are applied to the canopy which means that the greeblings&nbsp;consist nothing but pieces... which also means that if you don&#39;t like that stickers replace the traditional details...</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>You&#39;ll be AMAZED by the final product once you have it complete. The amount of greeblings&nbsp;do make it feel organic and authentic. It does feel like a replica or a combination of most Y-Wing sketches into a finished product. The engine pylons are excessively detailed and the cyclone aspect is preserved thanks to the greeblings&nbsp;and the initial structure. The original UCS from 2004 had blocky pylons and had a canonical mistake with green exhausts. This new edition fixes this mistake and the end of each engine pylon looks incredible thanks to the added flaps.</p>

<p>Even when you look at the underside, you can see the greeblings&nbsp;as well as a natural surface for the canopy. And yes, the targeting computer can easily be put on the other side of the pilot&#39;s seat as it is supposed to be... as shown during the Trench Run assault by Dutch. Being able to open the cabin without moving the ion cannons is also a welcome addition (I owned the original one with incredibly large pieces).</p>

<p>The model feels heavy but looks excellent from almost any angle, even the non-camera friendly angles if you take pictures and share the final result. The back of the starfighter&nbsp;could have been neglected but it has been reproduced with excellent detail and the same goes for every side of each pylon, including the parts that is supposed the pylons to the rest of the fuselage which means that the colored parts that aren&#39;t supposed to be shown is covered almost perfectly. The &quot;broken&quot; state of the Y-Wing makes it feel authentic, organic and is, in general, an excellent reproduction of one of the famous starfighters&nbsp;in cinema history.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Remove the stickers and replace them with printed pieces... make Dutch an actual unique minifigure... That&#39;s all the negative I can think of. If you already own the original UCS Y-Wing from 2004, I don&#39;t think you would need to buy this remake. It is apparently shorter but makes up for incredible detail from top to bottom with the greeblings&nbsp;including the pylons being closer to a &quot;cyclone&quot;. None of the colors seem out of place except for a bit of pink on the underside of the canopy and, again, each panel of every&nbsp;side of both pylons cover the structure or the skeleton part of the main build.</p>

<p>Building the 75181: Y-Wing Starfighter&nbsp;reminded me of the kid in me&nbsp;having my first large LEGO Star Wars set, the 7150: TIE Fighter and Y-Wing. It brought nostalgia to another level. Having played Rogue Leader and having seen the evolution of the Y-Wing through the datanase, I can definitely appreciate this starfighter&nbsp;on my shelf in its most complex LEGO design! Now I can only hope that, one day, LEGO will announce the remake of the UCS Darth Vader&#39;s TIE Advanced X1 so I can complete this nostalgia trip. Building an UCS set is an incredible experience, once again. While 2016 wasn&#39;t the best year for the UCS label, the Snowspeeder&nbsp;brought it back and the Millennium Falcon jumped the whole label to a million. The Y-Wing is a follow-up to that process.</p>

<h3>Buy or Don&#39;t Buy?</h3>

<p>If you wished to own an UCS version of the Y-Wing, you now have an opportunity to do so instead of paying double or triple the amount for the original by comparison. The rendition is excellent and will belong&nbsp;with other UCS or your Y-Wing collection. If you already have the Rogue One Y-Wing or the original UCS Y-Wing, there&#39;s very little reason to own the remake. If you have the money and do not wish to get the Rogue One version due to extra play features and minifigures, this will definitely be a good pick.</p>

"16brockmanf","2019-04-09T11:53:00.083Z","We're Starting Our Attack Run!","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>This UCS Y-Wing is a redesign of a previous UCS model, the 10134 Y-Wing Attack Starfighter. However I do not own that set, nor do I own any other UCS Set, this being my first. I&#39;ve been saving up to buy one for some time, and this happened to be the one that was for sale when I finally did buy one, so there&#39;s little bias in that way. However, if I&#39;m honest, I love the Y-Wing, being my 4th favourite design in Star Wars ships (doesn&#39;t sound&nbsp;like much, but really think about how many designs there are in Star Wars!), so I&#39;ll try my best to be objective about this.</p>

<p><strong>Box and Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Straight away here, this&nbsp;feels like a special occasion. The box is not only huge but it has that really sleek recent UCS design that I&#39;m personally a big fan of. It&#39;s even better than the update for the 2015 UCS sets, and not ony that, the art of the ship looks great. You start to understand where some of that &pound;170 went to. Opening up the box, there&#39;s also an inner box (boxception), which I didn&#39;t know existed, and took me by surprise, thinking only the UCS Falcon had it. But it looks so sleek, and really gives an extra feeling of magnificence to the set. I don&#39;t usually keep boxes, but I might here.&nbsp;The instructions have 4 pages of really cool and interesting information about the designer and graphic designer, and the Y-Wing in general, which I poured over for about 20 minutes. Never have I had such a fanfare with opening a set, and makes me feel like &pound;170 may still be worth it!</p>

<p><strong>Building</strong></p>

<p>The build took me approximately 5 hours (I&#39;m a bit of a perfectionist so all the 1x1 pieces have to be as straight as possible. Adds maybe an hour to the build), and was satisfying when it was done. At some point I was getting slightly bored by all the greebling on the fuselage, but once I started the wings/engines, it was a little more interesting. I love the way the vanes at the back of the exhaust attach, and the build in general for the engines is really clever, and I felt like it was&nbsp;quite special. The front section with the cockpit, is masterfully designed, and was the most fun to build, and definitely my favourite.&nbsp;All in all, not as groundbreaking as I&#39;ve heard the 75060 Slave I was, but still a really clever build that is satisfying to do.</p>

<p><strong>Auxiliaries</strong></p>

<p>There are 2 minifigures in this set, one being Jon &#39;Dutch&#39; Vander, and R2-BHD. Here, I think the set has let me down. This is a UCS Set, so I don&#39;t expect there to be a large number of figures, but I expect the ones that are there to be not only exclusive, but some of the best figures you can get. And I just don&#39;t feel that here. Whilst R2-BHD is exclusive, and the printing in Metallic Silver looks pretty cool, it&#39;s an Astromech Droid, and we&#39;ve had so many that it doesn&#39;t feel too special. Dutch Vander to me is a disappointment. There is no arm printing which is now expected on UCS sets, and the face, torso and legs are not exclusive. The helmet printing is nice enough, but actually not hugely accurate. Just look up an image of his helmet and you&#39;ll see what I mean. So here, I do not feel I got my money&#39;s worth for &pound;170.</p>

<p>This set comes with a UCS stand and Plaque, which are all nice and add to the feeling of exclusivity, but it&#39;s nothing new, and has been around since the beginning of UCS.</p>

<p><strong>Y-Wing</strong></p>

<p>The finished product is really something. Against other UCS sets it may not be the largest ever, but it is certainly big and hefty, and is a pretty awesome thing on display. For me that&#39;s what the purpose of this should be. For me to be wowed by it every time I walk in a room, and it does. It&#39;s also pretty sturdy, and nothing&#39;s fallen off on me yet, and I never feel precarious with it. It&#39;s even mildly swooshable.&nbsp;But I&#39;ve never grabbed it by the end of the engines yet...</p>

<p>But the designer has been able to do more than that. It is so remarkably close to screen accurate it boggles the mind. The proportions feel right, and on a side-by-side picture, almost all the greebling matches up to something! Here is where I think you really get your money&#39;s worth. There is so much detail that 3 days after building, I discovered something new that I&#39;d always glazed over, which is the 2 binocular pieces facing upwards and squeezed in by a slope piece. Masterfully done. I genuinely enjoy just sitting and looking at the scale of the set, but also the fine detail.</p>

<p>However, nothing&#39;s perfect, and there&#39;re a couple of things I don&#39;t really like. The sticker on the canopy feels unfinished, and so from some angles looks a little odd, and I also thing the way the white dome is &#39;connected&#39; to the struts of the engines by those bar pieces with technic pins on top also looks a little off, not quite right. But I&#39;m being a little picky here.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>I really like this set. A lot. I really think the level of detail on this can compare it to plastic models that are released, and it just looks so good displayed. It really does feel special walking in to the room and seeing it there, not only a looker, but having built it, I myself know that it&#39;s excellently designed too.</p>

<p>But is it &pound;170 special? I&#39;m not fully convinced. I really am disappointed by the minifigures, and was hoping for more. In my collection, I know I have more special figures than these, like Darth Malgus for example, and when I&#39;m spending this kind of money, I expect some of the best. The figures in the 75144&nbsp;Snowspeeder were far better, for example. If this were &pound;150/155 then I would say that it really is worth it.</p>

<p>However, I do think I can still recommend this, for anyone who can afford it. I don&#39;t know how it compares to 10134, but in my opinion, just from the pictures, this looks a lot better. Up to you!</p>

"StarKiller22515","2020-02-05T23:05:39.02Z","Another Great UCS Model","<p>This is yet another great UCS set. The amount of grebiling (detail) on the neck of the Y-Wing is incredible! So much detail went into this model that it is crazy. The head of the Y-Wing uses bricks to add shape and colour and not too many stickers are used in this set. The engines are sturdy enough so that they don&#39;t fall off and the landing skids are a good option for a landed display if you don&#39;t have high shelves or don&#39;t like the stand. The cockpit is very detailed and fits the pilot nicely. The Astromech is able to sit horizontally which is the correct way that they are supposed to sit. I was super excited when they released this set because the Y-Wing is one of my favourite ships from Star Wars and seeing it in this highly detailed UCS form was amazing. I would highly recommend getting this before it discontinues.</p>

"lego_collector_123","2019-07-16T03:47:23.853Z","We're starting our attack run!","<p>The Y-wing has always been one of my favourite Star Wars starfighters&nbsp;with its distinctive Y shape when viewed from the top. This is my second&nbsp;UCS set and my largest lego set to date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>Unlike most smaller Lego sets where the build is less important to me, enjoying putting together this monster was crucial and it didn&#39;t disappoint. The fuselage is built&nbsp;up with layers of detail making the build constantly entertaining, and the satisfaction of attaching the last engine pod was great. A&nbsp;number of interesting pieces are used for&nbsp;greebling such as: a whip, iron ingots, battle droid bodies, bucket handles, ice skates and tank treads. The engine pods are built&nbsp;with a central core, and then panels are attached.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>Gold leader: Jon Vander&#39;s iconic helmet looks great in Lego form with detailed printing on the front, sides, and top, making it&nbsp;one of my favourite pieces in the set. The head print shows a smiling expression on one side and a terrified expression on the other. Unfortunately for a UCS set, the face print&nbsp;is used frequently. The torso and legs look fantastic with excellent detail but are also not exclusive. He comes with a blaster pistol. The helmet looks fantastic but an exclusive head and or flight suit would have been nice.</p>

<p>R2-BHD: The different greys and silvers used for this R2 unit make the otherwise plain colour scheme more interesting. The printing on the torso and head, also primarily in silver, are well detailed. Lego makes good astromech droids and this one is a nice addition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set&nbsp;</p>

<p>The display stand&#39;s primary function is&nbsp;to securely hold the spaceship in place and it does that well.&nbsp;The stand tilts forward a bit making the y-wing appear to be in flight and allows you to see the top better. The UCS sticker looks good and shows interesting information like weapons, size, and the manufacture of its in universe counterpart. Jumper plates let you pose the figures on either side of the plaque to good effect.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In contrast to the greebled&nbsp;body, the &quot;head&quot; of the ship is smooth from every side. I especially like the technique&nbsp;used to attach bricks upside down making the bottom look almost as detailed as the top. A rotating turret on top can be moved by turning a gear in the fuselage, although&nbsp;the friction makes it harder than turning it manually. The use of the X-wing canopy does not reflect the movies&nbsp;as it flips up, rather than a section&nbsp;opening out to the side. The interior&nbsp;of the cockpit is very well detailed featuring a flight yoke, three &nbsp;control panels represented by stickers&nbsp;and a targeting computer.&nbsp;There is plenty of space to pose a minifigure&nbsp;comfortably. 13 of the&nbsp;14 stickers in this set are used on the &quot;head&quot; which is irritating to put on although they are necessary to show the yellow stripe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The body of the ship is exquisitely detailed with countless&nbsp;parts&nbsp;repurposed&nbsp;to create&nbsp; amazing texture.&nbsp;The bottom of the ship&nbsp;hasn&#39;t been forgotten&nbsp;as it shows&nbsp;small details and three,&nbsp;functioning landing struts. R2-BHD&nbsp;fits nicely&nbsp;and is facing the front as seen in the movie,&nbsp;unlike the smaller Y-wing lego models&nbsp;where he sits facing the side. The stand slots in on the base of the ship and can be removed easily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The engine pods are my favourite part of this ship, due to the fantastic greebling while still being well rounded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is Huge, taking a whole shelf to its self, so if you&nbsp;are pressed for space its&nbsp;not your ideal set, however, if you&#39;re looking for an impressive display piece this is the set for you. It also has heft to it making it feel like a real build.</p>

<p>$300 AUD is the rrp which is not cheap. Nearly 2,000 parts make the price to part ratio about average but not great.&nbsp;However the stunning end product and the satisfying build makes the price&nbsp;worth it in my opinion, although if your not a fan of the in universe model you probably won&#39;t like this set. The minifigures are good but not must haves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Altogether&nbsp;a stunning display piece,&nbsp;and if you like Y-wings and have the money you will definitely&nbsp;enjoy this.&nbsp;</p>
