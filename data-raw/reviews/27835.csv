<p>This set had limited retail availability and I managed to get it attached to the front of the Lego City Comic, Giant Series. The comic is in the shops between 9th January 2019 and 19th February 2019 and is priced &pound;4.85 in the UK, which represents pretty good value in my view, especially when you compare it to <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/CITY951901-1/Police-Officer-and-Jet"">951901</a> which is &pound;4.25.</p>

<p><strong>Packet</strong></p>

<p>This set is in a standard Polybag and contains a folded instruction sheet, printed on both sides. Most Polybags have the hole in the top for shops to attach to displays, and this is no different. It is attached to the comic by a strip of tape and is easy to remove without damaging either the Polybag or the comic. There is only one image on the front of the packet and it shows the Police Water Plane in action.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>You only get one in this set, which the comic informs you is Police Officer Pauline. She consists of the same torso and legs used for the pilots in three other sets from the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-City/subtheme-Mountain-Police"">Mountain Police</a> line &ndash; <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60173-1/Mountain-Arrest"">60173</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60174-1/Mountain-Police-Headquarters"">60174</a> and <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60175-1/Mountain-River-Heist"">60175</a>. The head used has appeared in 22 sets to date over the last few years. This complete Minifigure appears in only one other set, which is <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60173-1/Mountain-Arrest"">60173</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Main Build/Parts</strong></p>

<p>The build is complete in 18 steps and is a really good set for the 48 part piece count. It is not obvious from the main image but the pontoons are connected to the main build through a <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/303224/plate-4x6"">4X6 bright yellow plate</a>. This gives the set a very solid construction which should hold up to a lot of play and keep it all held together.</p>

<p>The pilot sits comfortably at the front with handlebars and a 1X2 printed tile. Behind the pilot the wings are attached in a way that allows them to rock from side to side which gives a great extra element of play. The propeller on the back spins well too.</p>

<p>Other than the Minifigure the parts for this are pretty basic and appear in lots of sets. Indeed the most popular piece is the pin with friction that is used in over 2,000 sets. The rarest piece is the Skeleton Arm No 4, with only 16 sets using it, and it is used to connect the handlebars.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>I really like this set and would certainly recommend buying the comic to get it. Other similar Polybags have been priced at &pound;4.00 in the UK, so &pound;4.85 for both comic and set is really good value. The Police Water Plane compliments the series well. The next in this Giant Series will be Ninjago and will feature Lloyd in set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30532-1/Turbo"">30532</a>.</p>
