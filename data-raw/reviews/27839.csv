<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box and Instructions</h3>

<p>The box has a nice clean design, with an image of the set taking the foreground. The logo banner is a nice blue color with a much less disturbing image of Harry and co. The instructions came bent and the box has a dreaded push tab</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>One dreaded item this set doesn&rsquo;t have, though, is a sticker sheet. Several printed elements are included. The build is quick, but fun. Aragog&rsquo;s Head in particular is genius.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>4 spider eyes plus a spare</p>

<p>1 2x2 dish with web pattern</p>

<p>5 1x1 plate with leaves</p>

<p>1 new style plant stalk plus a spare</p>

<p>2 Brown and 2 Dark Brown wands</p>

<p>&nbsp;Several brown and olive elements.</p>

<h3>Completed</h3>

<p>The Completed Model is quite nice. Aragog&nbsp;is perfect, no the tree is simple but works as is. The many small spiders help make it even creepier.</p>

<h3>Minifigures&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Harry and Ron are included. Their clothes are very accurate, no they have scared or happy faces.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>This set is quite fun. The little web shooter is nice, and Aragog&nbsp;suitably menacing. The small spiders add to the play scenarios, and the wands are very easy to pose for play, as opposed to the great whopping 4L bars of yore.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is a nice set, with a good price, $15 for 157 pieces.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2018-08-25T17:05:55.097Z","Knockout Set is a stunning Revisit to the Forbidden Forest!","<p>In 2002 around the release of the film&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets&nbsp;</em>I got set 4727-1 Aragog in the Dark Forest. It was never one of my favorite Harry Potter sets, and over the years I let it fall apart and become part of the spare pieces bin. Now, 16 years later Aragog&#39;s Lair is essentially a remake of the original 2002 set, and succeeds in surpassing it in everyway!<br />
<br />
<strong>Figures</strong></p>

<p><em>Harry Potter</em></p>

<p>Other than Star Wars itself, the Harry Potter/Wizarding World license has been one of Lego&#39;s longest running themes. Despite a few years between releases with no major sets since the last Harry Potter film and only a few Dimensions packs in-between; the theme has returned now to great fanfare. It makes sense that &#39;The Boy Who Lived&#39; would factor into the theme heavily, appearing in everything from the Collectible Minifigure line, as a microfigure in the D2C Hogwarts, and again in the retail sets.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now part of my reason for mentioning the previous Aragog in the Dark Forest set is because the Harry and Ron variants in this set are modernized remakes of the 2002 sets figures... for comparison here is the Brickset&nbsp;database image of the 2002 figure:<br />
<br />
<img alt="""" src=""https://images.brickset.com/minifigs/large/hp033.jpg"" style=""width: 460px; height: 690px;"" /></p>

<p>And here is the modern iteration in the current set with the image from the Brickset archive:<br />
<br />
<img alt="""" src=""http://img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/MN/0/hp153.png"" style=""width: 293px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>Like the original figure, Harry is wearing a dark blue jacket over a light blue button up shirt. The new face print and hair mold are unique to the modern Harry figure. The black hair has a brighter sheen to it than the same piece from the collectible minifigure series, suggesting slight differences between the plastic used in the European/Mexican factories and the China factory were the collectible series is made. One of the biggest advances the current line has made is using the short legs on Harry Potter. While the short legs were available at the time of the original Harry Potter sets, they were only used for characters such as goblins and not on the main cast, so its a nice update to see them used so readily in the Wizarding World theme along with the new skirt and medium legs pieces to represent different characters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For accessories Harry comes with his wand which comes in a two-pack sprue and is a new mold for this year, and the new candle which is a two piece assembly with the flame and stick being separate pieces. As pointed out by reviewers such as Jangbricks, this line has been plagued with a minor printing error with the doublesided head, where rather than the two faces being perfectly 180 degrees from each other, there is more of an offset near 170 or 160 degrees between the faces. I have no clue what caused this error as it is present on both Harry and Ron, but their hair molds cover it up and make it hard to notice in practical play or display situations.</p>

<p><em>Ron Weasley&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>For starters here is the Brickset image of the original 2002 figure:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.brickset.com/minifigs/large/hp032.jpg"" style=""width: 460px; height: 690px;"" /></p>

<p>... and the Brickset image for the current figure:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/MN/0/hp154.png"" style=""width: 300px; height: 398px;"" /></p>

<p>I noticed the sweater-jacket is pretty similar to the original figure, but the original figure lacks the red undershirt. So I decided to grab a film still to see which figure was more accurate...</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/xboxtravis/Collection/harryandronfilmstill.jpg"" /></p>

<p>... and no surprise, the red undershirt is indeed present in the film! Harry is also holding the lantern which Ron is given as an accessory in this set in addition to his wand. Again the wand comes in a sprue with a second wand, placing a total of four wands in this set (*I wonder how many Olivander&#39;s MOCs will be inspired by all the spare wands lying around from this theme? I already feel like I have enough Lego wands for a small army and I have yet to buy any of the bigger sets!)&nbsp;The lantern is a new single piece mold, with enough room to place a cylindrical&nbsp;trans-yellow brick in it to give it a nice sheen. As previously mentioned, Ron has a doublesided head which was printed on a slight offset. I find his &#39;scared face&#39; print to be more similar to the actor (*note screenshot above) especially in this scene with the famous line &quot;Follow the spiders! Why couldn&#39;t it be follow the butterfly&#39;s?!?&quot; Ah, early 2000&#39;s kiddie horror film scenes, what&#39;s not to love?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, while the printing issue with the doublesided heads are a strange lapse of quality control on Lego&#39;s part; it feels like a nitpick at this point. Overall the two figures of this set are pretty spectacular and well worth having! Great updates all around. The only disappointment is that the same figures are re-used in the Hogwart&#39;s Express, but that is more a strike against <em>that </em>set since here the characters are screen accurate to their Chamber of Secrets appearance.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The set starts off building the tree. I love the new spider molds used here! The tree is rather straight forward except a small segment in the middle trunk which uses the Astromech body from Chopper in Star Wars Rebels to offset a Technic hole for a flick-fire missile function (*more on that later...).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The real meat of the build is Aragog... and boy oh boy... he is something special with lots of the new small pieces in Lego&#39;s catalog used to great effect and some simple SNOT methods to highlight the build. For a set I purchased for just $12 this is actually a surprisingly substantial build, and I really enjoyed it!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>The first real standout other than the minifigures is Aragog&nbsp;himself. This is the third rendition of the character (*although our fourth &#39;fantasy movie spider&#39; since Lord of the Rings gave us a Shelob build a few years back). This version of Aragog is probably the&nbsp;<em>best</em>&nbsp;of the three so far released. The first from my 2002 set was overly large and not vary posable. The second released alongside a variant of Hagrid&#39;s hut was smaller, but due to the design used had what looked like a flat face and odd proportions with the katana&nbsp;pieces as legs!</p>

<p>This Aragog&nbsp;though, manages to pack a lot of detail and playability into a very small build. The legs use the new-ish&nbsp;insect leg molds, and the eyes are represented using a nice print on the circular tile. Aragog joins the large line-up of &#39;Fantastic Beasts&#39; in this year&#39;s sets, and he does so pretty well.</p>

<p>The second part of the build, the tree is decent but not outstanding. The funnest part of the tree honestly is finding places to include the many many spiders included, having them dangle from different places and spook Harry and Ron. Yes... there is a flick fire missile included with a web print on it. I like the print, and when static it is a great addition to the tree... but I think as a play feature its sort of a dud. I don&#39;t like flick fire missiles in general, especially now that Lego has the spring loaded missiles and stud shooters as an alternative and those tend to work better than the flick fire design. Fortunately, the feature is so well hidden in this tree its easy to leave it there untouched if your like me and would much rather not have a flying missile web coming out of the tree.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With all that said, at $12 this is a great little set. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a cheap entry to the Wizarding World line, and also to anyone who is collecting the larger sets. Aragog&nbsp;alone is worth the price of admission, and while Harry and Ron are seen in another set this is the cheapest place to get them! Great value and great display options with Aragog&nbsp;and just a ton of fun all around.&nbsp;<br />

"JVM","2018-08-29T09:26:58.5Z","Follow the Spiders for a Great Value","<p>The lowest-priced set in the newly resurrected <em>Wizarding World of Harry Potter</em> subtheme, #75950 <em>Aragog&#39;s Lair</em> seeks to work as a value option for the wizarding world fan on a budget while also replicating accurately a scene from the 2002 film <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em>, with the non-human character Aragog as a focus, marking the giant spider&#39;s third time in bricks. How do they stack?</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Like the rest of the recent <em>Wizarding World</em> sets, we&#39;ve visited Aragog&#39;s lair before -- during the film&#39;s release, he appeared in the relatively affordable set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4727-1/Aragog-in-the-Dark-Foresthttps://brickset.com/sets/4727-1/Aragog-in-the-Dark-Forest"">4227: Aragog in the Dark Forest</a>, which very much seems to share common inspiration with this set, featuring similar minifigures, a spide-y trait section, and the giant spider himself. I do not currently have this set together for comparison, but owned it at the time. Aragog used dinosaur tails for legs!</p>

<p>A giant spider identified in publications as the Aragog character also made an appearance in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4738-1/Hagrid-s-Hut"">4738: Hagrid&#39;s Hut</a>, which is a favorite set of mine. The included giant spider there had an interesting build, using swords for legs and a brick built body. While a cool spider, I recall feeling he seemed a little smal for the imposing Aragog, and reminded me more of his kin, younger spiders in the forest.</p>

<p>For those not familiar with the Harry Potter characters and lore, I will focus on explaining the key character - during Harry&#39;s second year at school, he discovers that his friend, groundskeeper Hagrid, once had a pet acromantula, a species of magical giant spider known from southeast Asia and rare even among wizards. When falsely accused of murdering students, the acromantula was freed into the wilderness. Capable of speech and very wise, Aragog began a colony near Hogwarts school and maintained a friendship with Hagrid, but did not prevent his hungry children from feeding on other humans.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Experienced builders, especially in this theme, have probably seen spider webs and trees with old leaf pieces a million times before, and shouldn&#39;t expect to be too impressed. The plain blue mushroom lacks printing, but we do get the new jungley spiders in orange and black, and a newish leafy piece. Aragog comes with printed eyes and eight brown arachnid legs introduced only a few years ago that look marvelous. Brown is surprisingly the dominant color of the build, used for both the tree and the spider. Also included, as mentioned below, are the new candle and lantern pieces, which are superb.</p>

<p>Overall, there&#39;s some nice parts but unless you like building arachnids maybe not a great pars pack.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>There are two minifigures included in the set, both updated counterparts to those released in Set #4227 mentioned above, which I still had handy in my collection!</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Harry Potter: </strong>Using the same hair and face as other sets in the same wave, Harry wears a dark blue hoodie over light blue striped pajamas, and is equipped with a dark brown wand and a lit candle. He is wearing dark short brown pants. His face has both happy and scared expressions.</li>
	<li><strong>Ron Weasley: </strong>Using the same hair and face was other sets in the same wave, Ron is wearing a gray hoodie with a plaid pattern over a red sweater, with short dark blue legs. He&#39;s equipped with a brown wand and a new lantern. His face has both happy and scared expressions.</li>
</ul>

<p>These minifigures are key characters and fairly scene accurate, with more accurate details than their previous counterparts, but it does feel like it may have been nice to add Hagrid&#39;s trusty dog, Fang, who has never appeared in LEGO form. Additional minifigures would be welcome but a poor fit for the scene being depicted.</p>

<p>I personally have some misgivings about the new character stylizing but I will hold those for another review.. I might have preferred a gray wand for Ron though, as he was outfitted in the original sets.<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>First you build the tree, then Aragog. Building the tree is fairly straightforward and predictable, and includes a flick-fire missile of yore days to shoot webs at the boys for some reason - while I welcome play features, it&#39;s so simple that it doesn&#39;t seem necessary for lack of much of a result.</p>

<p>Building the spider is a little more interesting but not too much to write home about. The legs are repetitive but this is to be expected.</p>

<p><strong>Complete Set</strong></p>

<p>The tree is fairly unremarkable -- it performs its job of adding a dash of scenery to the set, and I suppose it looks more like a tree than some attempts we&#39;ve seen, but that doesn&#39;t make it very impressive. The added spider webs add a bit more character, but only a bit. The flick-fire missile is low enough to hit a minifigure but feels a little shoehorned-in. Mushrooms and small plants again, add character but aren&#39;t very unique.</p>

<p>I confess I went into this set expecting to be disappointed in Aragog but he is a much tighter build than I expected -- .the abdomen is relatively small, but manages to pack in all the necessary parts to connect the other pieces. The throax is large compared to the previous release and has a much stronger attachment. The head, previously dedicated to a printed piece, is much more detailed with several parts to include multiple eyes and teeth, allowing for some expression, and of course, the ABS plastic special arachnid legs look both realistic and are allowed independent articulation, while being sturdier than some previous solutions, such as rubbery toes and swords. The brown pieces fit surprisingly well despite my worry it would break up the color scheme.</p>

<p>Although smaller than the original version and closer in size to the version included with Hagrid&#39;s Hut, this version is much bulkier and more detailed. maximizing the pieces and space made available for a model that is very solid and substantial.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>With only a couple major parts, a summary isn&#39;t necessary, so I&#39;ll cut to the chase - this set is a fantastic value for money. In addition to two minifigures of key characters who make up probably half the value of the set in themselves on the secondary market, you have a fantastic, well-articulated and detailed brick-built creature who is as much a character as an accessory, capable of functioning as friend or foe in play. Those alone make up the set&#39;s value, even without the unimpressive tree.</p>

<p>Although Ron would probably advise you to stay away from anything with a larger spider in it, I can&#39;t help but recommend this set for it&#39;s great value as much as anything. It&#39;s a solid improvement on previous attempts and even if you&#39;re not a big fan of HP, it&#39;s a very nice spider build in and of itself.</p>

"DeluxeBrix","2019-08-01T19:25:25.45Z","Spiders","<p>This is a very good set for its size.</p>

<p>The build is very simple but effective, and never boring. The tree looks a bit odd, but you can still recognize it as a tree. Aragog is the best part of the set. He has a lot of posability for such a small build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs are pretty good. They have good prints for making regular people, something that is difficult to find in newer sets. They aren&rsquo;t exclusive, but they are very good nonetheless.</p>

<p>There are also some excellent parts in this set. Aragog&rsquo;s legs look great. &nbsp;There is a spiderweb print that could be very useful if you don&rsquo;t want an oversized web. The highlight of the set&rsquo;s parts is the new spider mold. It looks very realistic and scary. The candlestick pieces are also good.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a nice little set and a good parts pack. I give it a 4/5.</p>

"ChocolateCyborg","2019-01-01T20:03:32.57Z","Aragog's Lair","<p><strong>Box and Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The box and manual are just like most other boxes and manuals.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>You get Harry Potter and&nbsp;Ron Weasley. Harry has gray pants with no detail on them and his torso has a blue jacket with a zipper and a blue shirt under the jacket (you do not actually get a jacket and shirt it is just printed on his torso) as well as his wand and a candle and black hair.&nbsp;Ron has dark blue pants with no printing on them and a torso with a gray and black sweater and a red shirt underneath (once again only print) and orange hair. Ron also comes with his wand and a very nice lantern piece.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The tree was very easy to build and has nice play features. To start you have a little missle you can shoot out from the tree as well as 4 spiders (2 of which are extra) and there are many places that you can place these spiders on the tree. Aragog is a nice and easy to build but is my least favorite part of the set (which you will see later on in the review), his legs are really nice but also flimsy and are very hard to get them to stay in place.</p>

<p><strong>My overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;Aragogs is my least favorite part about the set, I often find that his butt is getting detached from the rest of his body no matter how hard I&nbsp;connect it to the rest of the body. Another problem I&nbsp;find with Aragog is that I cant angle his head down (which is a problem for me since I like to model my sets because I&nbsp;cant have him look at Ron, but if you just like to play then this isn&#39;t a problem for you). Besides those two things this is a really nice set and a good starter set if you are just getting into legos.</p>

"Mr__BananaHead","2020-06-06T03:20:39.85Z","A Cheap But Average Set","<p><strong>Minifigs:</strong>&nbsp;Both the Harry and Ron figs are pretty average, with nothing special about them. I do like the nice lantern accessory, and the newer candle piece looks nice, although it doesn&#39;t work well as a minifigure accessory.</p>

<p><strong>Build:</strong>&nbsp;The small terrain piece is a mark above average for its size, but the star is, of course, Aragog. The technique for the face is genius, and every other part besides the legs looks great.</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong>&nbsp;Aragog articulates reasonably well, and the flick missile is very well integrated into the build. The loose spiders can help give life to the playability, and you can reenact the movie scene with a bit of imagination.</p>

<p><strong>Displayability:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;This set is an okay&nbsp;display piece. It can fit onto even the smallest of shelves, the loose spiders can all find places on the terrain piece,&nbsp;and there is just enough space to pose the minifigs. The downfall to the displayability is, unfortunately, Aragog himself. I just can&#39;t get him into a good display pose, mainly because he cannot interact with the terrain space like everything else.</p>

<p><strong>Price:</strong>&nbsp;The set has a relatively good price/piece ratio. Of course, I always wish it could have been twelve or thirteen dollars, but that&#39;s just the way it goes.&nbsp;</p>
