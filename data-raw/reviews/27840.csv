"xboxtravis7992","2018-09-10T18:38:44.783Z","THESTRAL!!!!","<p>One of the smallest sets in the relaunched Wizarding&nbsp;World theme is Grindewald&#39;s Escape. Its one of only two sets based on the Fantastic Beasts series in the theme, and the only one based on the upcoming 2018 film&nbsp;<em>The Crimes of Grindewald</em>. This set caught the eye of Lego fans with its inclusion of a Thestral, the skeletal winged horses from the franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><em>Gellert Grindewald</em>; currently only two versions of Grindewald are available, this figure and the one from the Collectible Minifigure&nbsp;series. The two share some similarities, but have a few differences worth noting for collectors. First of the collectible version can be displayed as Percival Graves, and has some pretty cool pin stripping on the arms this set version lacks. Also the set version has Grindewald without a mustache, something the collectible series version does have.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
With that said... the Collectible Minifigure&nbsp;version is a pain in the butt to get; being the rarest figure in the entire series. For those not wanting to spend hours feeling blind bags or paying a Bricklink seller the price of this set just to get one figure; I think this set&#39;s version is an acceptable replacement. One detail that is worth noting is that on both sides of the head Grindewald&#39;s&nbsp;right eye is a light gray color, a nice variation from the normal minifigure&nbsp;black pupils. The figure uses a light tan wand which comes in a two pack sprue like all the wands in this series, and also has a power blast piece. Personally not the biggest fan of the power blast piece, but it gives him a different look on display which I can say is magic coming from his hand.<br />
<br />
<em>Seraphina&nbsp;Picquery</em>; a unique character to this set; Seraphina is the President of the MACUSA in the first Fantastic Beasts Film; the secret magical governing body in the United States. Her organization arrests Grindewald at the end of the film, setting up the reasons for his &#39;escape&#39; here. Her head is single printed, which is okay considering the use of the sailor hat would not be able to hide a double-sided&nbsp;print. The light blue used from top to bottom in her outfit is pretty striking, even if the prints on the torso are a bit plain. The skirt piece is the new one introduced this year, and exclusive in this color. She also comes with a power blast piece like Grindewald. The wand is an exclusive purple color, which has not been seen yet in any other set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Anybody else remember the Stagecoach from the Lone Ranger theme? This set has echos of that older build all over it, albeit much smaller and more realistically compact. The use of the vine pieces to set the bars at the front and back ends of the carriage are a nice parts usage. Other than that, a fun but not overall surprising build.</p>

<p><strong>The Finished Model</strong></p>

<p>Once built, the carriage is a modest but very good looking build. Let&#39;s talk about that Thestral pulling it first! This is a brand new mold, with a spot on the back for the assembly holding up the wings to be placed. Unfortunately, the base mold is static, unable to move its legs or head in any form. However, the addition of the wings offers some basic pose-ability&nbsp;by placing the wings up or down. Overall, an impressive figure which justifies the purchase of this set alone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The black color of the carriage is a bit plain, but accurate to the colors used in similar Thestral&nbsp;carriages such as those used by&nbsp;<a href=""http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Hogwarts_Carriages"">Hogwarts</a>&nbsp;in the original films. The fact this set looks so similar to the carriages used at Hogwarts may offer a reason for some fans to buy multiples, switch out the Fantastic Beasts figures and replace them with Hogwarts&nbsp;students and that&#39;s the start of a diorama right there! The carriage rolls freely, and the top can be opened to place figures inside.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Compared to the other two smaller sets in this theme (the Forbidden Forest set and the Quidditch pitch set); this is probably the least exciting of the three. However, the inclusion of two good figures and the exclusive Thestral&nbsp;along with the well done carriage are all worth the price of purchase. The chance to get Grindewald&nbsp;outside of the rare Collectible Figure alone will be enough to justify this set for those who do not wish to chase down the rarer figure. All in all, not my favorite set of this wave but by all means one that is very satisfying to build and display. The re-launched Wizarding World theme has a great batting average, and I hope to see that continue once I am able to start getting some of the larger sets!&nbsp;</p>

"IndyLibrarian","2018-09-20T16:29:37.533Z","Lovely carriage, great minifigs","<p><strong>Carriage</strong> This is the best looking minifig-scale carriage LEGO has made. Other carriages were either too large (like the stagecoach in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/79108-1/Stagecoach-Escape"" target=""_self"">79108</a>), or oddly shaped, overly boxy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides its good size and shape, this carriage has a neat attachment for the front axle giving it a nice rotation. The 4 plant stems in black are a great detail and&nbsp;provide&nbsp;interesting shaping.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong>&nbsp;Both minifigs&nbsp;look great, though some lower printing on the&nbsp;Seraphina Picquery&nbsp;figure would have been nice. The thestral&nbsp;is also very impressive, a step up from previous incarnations. Because the harness is built into the body, you will need to use pieces from your own parts bin if you wish to the show the thestral detached from its harness.&nbsp;</p>

"8BrickMario","2020-06-29T21:29:17.297Z","Like Grindelwald himself, this set was released too soon.","<p>I was interested in getting this set because I like a good carriage and Thestral, and knew that, due to the minimal representation of the&nbsp;<em>Fantastic Beasts&nbsp;</em>films in LEGO&#39;s output, that this may be as good a chance as any to get the characters in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>The pieces in this set are good. I&#39;m not familiar with the carriage doors, so those are nice, and you get some nice black plant stalks and gunmetal grey carriage wheels.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p><strong>Gellert Grindelwald</strong>&nbsp;is a Dark wizard and the most infamous before Voldemort; the&nbsp;<em>Fantastic Beasts&nbsp;</em>series focuses on his rise to power and eventual defeat. Grindelwald&#39;s appearance is notably unusual, featuring a white eye, a side-shaved white hairstyle and mustache, and eccentric fashion. I think the minifigure does a rather poor job of representing him, though. For a generic depiction of Grindelwald, it&#39;s not terrible, but there are several things that could have been done better. His slicked-back hairstyle is a baffling choice, given his distinctive modern haircut, which is flat in the first film and spikier in the second. To replicate the hairstyle, Zane&#39;s hair from&nbsp;<em>The LEGO Ninjago Movie</em>&nbsp;would have been an optimal choice, though it wouldn&#39;t allow him to have an alternate expression. He&#39;s stoic enough not to need two faces, though. His face is mostly unchanged from his appearance in the minifigure series, but for the illogical removal of his mustache, which he keeps all the way through the second film. I also don&#39;t like the way they represent his heterochromia with a grey eye, since it&#39;s subtle enough to look like a misprint. An outlined white eye would have the same startling contrast effect as in the film. These failings are bad enough for a generic Grindelwald, but in this particular scene, he is meant to look unkempt after imprisonment, with shaggy hair and an unshaven face. Snape&#39;s hairstyle and a different face print would have done this, but we get a Grindelwald even more clean-shaven than he&#39;s ever depicted in the film. His outfit looks alright, though, with the popped collar and green vest he&#39;s seen wearing in some scenes. The phylactery he wears on his lapel would have been a nice touch, but I&#39;ll let that slide.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Seraphina Picquery</strong>&nbsp;probably shouldn&#39;t be in this set. The President of the Magical Congress of the United States makes her only appearance in the second film&nbsp;to send off the prison carriage and isn&#39;t involved in the escape sequence. Her outfit is a decent approximation of the film&#39;s, with the asymmetrical blue hat and dress, though in the film, it looks like a royal blue, not this subtle sand color,&nbsp;and the sailor hat LEGO uses is only a substitute for a hat that would require a new mold. Picquery&#39;s face looks good, though, with a darker nougat tone, a confident expression, and her signature curls of blonde hair. Her sloped dress piece is unprinted, which seems to be a frustrating and&nbsp;lazy trend with this theme. This outfit doesn&#39;t need a printed slope nearly as much as some others, but some lines would have been nice. Her wand is purple, which seems a little off. Picquery&#39;s wand does have a magenta crystal as&nbsp;the handle, but it becomes distracting when the solid-colored wand is all purple. It&#39;s kinda fun, though.</p>

<p>Picquery and Grindelwald both have power-blast pieces to represent spells flying.</p>

<p>Grindelwald&#39;s carriage is pulled by a <strong>t</strong><strong>hestral&nbsp;</strong>(several in the film), a winged skeletal horse invisible to those who have not witnessed death. This thestral is a new piece instead of the typical LEGO horse skeleton, and it reflects their emaciated, yet fleshy nature better. It&#39;s scary and beautiful in the right ways, and I really like it.</p>

<p><strong>Anybody missing?</strong></p>

<p>In this scene, Grindelwald is revealed to have switched places with one of his followers, Abernathy, who enters the carriage in Grindelwald&#39;s form, and Grindelwald uses his freedom to release Abernathy from the carriage for his loyalty. Abernathy&nbsp;should have been in the set. There are also some MACUSA officials on the ride, and just one to&nbsp;be a driver would have worked. Grindelwald also uses and discards a pet Chupacabra in this scene, which would have been nice to see.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The finished model</h2>

<p>Grindelwald&#39;s prison carriage is a nice model, if a little downsized. I wouldn&#39;t expect LEGO to include a team of eight Thestrals to pull it, so that&#39;s fine, but the interior could have sat at least one more person.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Regardless, the carriage is an attractive model and fairly easy to take out of a wizarding context. I like the bars on the front and back, the steps, the driver&#39;s seat, and the space behind the carriage where luggage or minifigures can be placed. The doors are nice and open well, and the interior has some red bricks for a plush seat, with the barest suggestion of the seat opposite, but which is unstudded and too narrow&nbsp;to be sat upon. The roof comes off for easy access. This set has no stickered detail, but for once, I think it could use some: in the film, the doors are seen to have rows of tiny locks that set into place along the edges, so stickers on the doors to show that would have been welcome.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This set screams of being released too early. When it came out, the film hadn&#39;t released yet, but now that it has been, the set shows the hallmarks of being directed by preliminary material. In trying to be a promotion, it missed the time required to be an accurate reflection of the film, so it&#39;s a little disappointing. The model itself is really nice and the thestral is excellent, but it&#39;s perhaps the weakest set in the Wizarding World theme in terms of accuracy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building experience was very quick and enjoyable.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts fit their respective places perfectly.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set is fun to play with, the only problem is that the Thestral slides as you hold the coach the Thestral slides side to side as you move the coach</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Value for money doesn&#39;t really go with the number of pieces, It goes with the size of the set itself.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this set is amazingly action pack.</p>

<p>There are a lot&nbsp;parts in this set.&nbsp; I find myself&nbsp; building the carriage first, and the horse and minifigs&nbsp;latter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite all that it&#39;s a gorgeous set i enjoyed putting togther.&nbsp;</p>
