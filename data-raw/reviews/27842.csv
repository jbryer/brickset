"BrickOstrich","2018-08-14T02:06:49.183Z","Great in most ways","<p>This set is great overall. First off, the price to part ratio is better than average and and the content is great for the set. Minifigures are great including four&nbsp;exclusives including Filch, Seamus Finnegan and Harry and Ron in casual attire. The build of the set is decent with great detail inside&nbsp;Snape&#39;s&nbsp;classroom. there are plenty of stickers so if you are not confident with those this set may not be for you.There are a few places in the castle to pose minifigures but not as many as I would like. The Whomping&nbsp;willow looks great although the Ford Anglia has trouble being posed in the branches. Besides that the tree is fantastic!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It includes a section of Hogwarts, The Whomping Willow,&nbsp;the Weasley&#39;s Car, and 6 minifigures. It was released in 2018 for $69.99 and has 753 pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><strong>Harry Potter-</strong> This version of Harry Potter is in casual clothes that have nice printing. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Ron Weasley-</strong> This version of Ron Weasley is also in casual clothes that look nice. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Hermione Granger.</strong> This version of Hermione Granger is in a Gryffindor uniform and is in two&nbsp;other sets. 9/10</p>

<p><strong>Seamus Finnigan-</strong> This Is the only set that Seamus Finnigan comes in and he is wearing a Gryffindor uniform. 9/10</p>

<p><strong>Professor Severus Snape-</strong> This minifigure comes in one&nbsp;other set and has nice printing that continues on to the legs. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Argus Filch- </strong>This minifigure only comes in this set and is a really good minifigure with nice printing and a good hair piece. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The&nbsp;whomping willow is a great build. The car looks good and is accurate to the movie and the trunk can open and close. The car can be put in the Whomping Willow and it can shake around the Whomping Willow to make the car fall out. The branches on it can be moved around and the details are really nice. The main build is a section of Hogwarts that can be connected to The Hogwarts Great Hall set. On the inside there is Snape&#39;s potion classroom with nice detailing of potions on shelves. On the other side is Snape&#39;s office&nbsp;that has pictures in it and nice details. In the biggest tower there is a second floor for The Gryffindor dorm room that only has two beds. 9/10</p>

<p><strong>Summary&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This is a nice set to get if you want to expand The Hogwarts Great Hall set to make it bigger. The minifigures are really good in this set with Argus Filch being my favorite in this set. The Whomping Willow is a great build with nice play features. The car being able to fit in The Whomping Willow to be shaken out is a really good play feature. I recommend this set if you have The Hogwarts Great Hall set because it looks good connected together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the Wizarding World wave of sets, Hogwarts Womping Willow is one of the two play sets included located on Hogwarts grounds. It is clearly inspired by one of the more iconic scenes of the whole Harry Potter series, with the flying Ford Anglia crashing into the Whomping Willow. The Whomping Willow is quite well done, the Anglia is good. The parts of Hogwarts castle are OK: nice play opportunity, good locations, but nothing special.</p>

<p>The bonus is that the minifigures&nbsp;included are well chosen and fit the elements of the set. Snape for the Potions class room, Filch for his closet, and Seamus Finnegan to populate the Gryffindor bed room. The build itself is OK. Putting the Whomping Willow together is fun, the Anglia is a fun build, but the rest is OK....&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a good set, and offers good value for money, even at regular price. You get all three main protagonists (Harry. Hermione and Ron), and two important characters in Filch and Snape. If you are a fan of Harry Potter and like a good play set, it is a set definitely worth getting.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build is easy and fun. There are some stickers, and the two decorating the trunk of the Whomping Willow are the only reason why&nbsp;I can imagine the set being rated ages 8 y.o. and up. Apart from some printed tiles I did not come across truly special parts.</p>

<p>The Whomping Willow is the best element of this set IMHO. The build is fun, and the construction of it perhaps not special, but definitely clever. The two stickers on the curved elements are somewhat tricky to apply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ford Anglia is more or less a standard car build. The cleverest part use is the construction of the front wheel well. The construction of the Hogwarts section is standard. There are some stickers, there is some furniture... honestly nothing special.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are 6 minifigures in this set: Harry, Hermione, Ron, Seamus Finnegan, Snape, and Filch. All but Hermione and Snape are unique to this set, which is a serious bonus. All of the minifigures&nbsp;have two distinct face prints, which is nice. Seamus and Hermione share a torso, while Ron and Harry wear the clothes in which they steered the Anglia to Hogwarts. I like Filch&#39;s print the best. In the case of Filch and Snape, the print is continued nicely on the legs. Overall they are top class minifigures.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The Whomping Willow is the star of the set. It is well designed, the entrance to the Hogsmeade tunnels and hide-out for Lupin&nbsp;is included, while the top of the tree, in combination with the branches is well suited to hold the Anglia. The trunk-additions are such that without using too much force in the mechanism actually allow the willow to whomp.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ford Anglia is nice, but barely big enough to fit Ron and Harry. The design works well. There actually fit two trunks into the boot of the car. Overall I like the car.</p>

<p>The Hogwarts scene is basic but useful. It contains what seem to be part of the Gryffindor dormitory, Potions Class Room, a teacher&#39;s office, and what might be Filch&#39;s broom closet, though I have no idea why that would include a painting. The tower is topped by the owlery.&nbsp;Overall, everything is designed well, the stickers do add to the looks of the whole thing. One of the most interesting elements is the lamp on the teacher&#39;s desk - creative use of a tyre rim, which unfortunately is not transparent.</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>This set is quite clearly above all a play set. Where the Ford Anglia can easily be used as a display piece, the Whomping Whillow&nbsp;is good for a play set, but arguably not good enough for a display set. The Hogwarts section simply lacks the looks for a clear display set - especially when one can compare it with the massive <strong>Hogwarts Castle</strong> display set (<strong>set 71043</strong>). In many ways it is simply unfair to compare the two sets for display value.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall this is a very good play set, with wonderful minifigures. The Whomping Willow is a lot of fun, especially when the Ford Anglia has crash-landed into it. The five minifigures are excellent, and include a number of unique ones - with Filch and Snape&nbsp;being top minifigs. This is a very good set. If not for the relative lack of minifigures&nbsp;- of which Hogwarts Great Hall (set 75954) has 10 - this might be the best &#39;normal&#39; set of the whole 2018 Wizarding World range. It offers good value for money at RRP, and especially at a discount.</p>

"DrKatBuilds","2020-04-02T07:47:01.657Z","I would like it more if it was just the car and tree","<p>Overall this was a great set that&#39;s not as large as the full Hogwarts castle. While the castle portion of the set was fun to build and included some great minifigures, the highlight for me was the Ford Anglia and the Whomping Willow. If the set only included those two pieces I would have been fine with it. The first half was significantly more fun to build than the second. I did like the details in the castle portion, which included the Potions classroom, Filch&#39;s office, and the Owlery. It includes some good minifigures with the pack, and my favorite was the classic scared Seamus. If you&#39;ve got the Great Hall set this portion combines with it which is great.&nbsp;To me the car/tree felt a little disjointed from building part of the castle, so it didn&#39;t really make sense to have them in the same set.&nbsp;But if you&#39;re looking for a taste of Hogwarts and a fun car to display this is a great set to purchase that&#39;s not crazy expensive.</p>
