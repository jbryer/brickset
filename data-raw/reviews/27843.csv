"vbence17","2018-08-14T19:00:37.983Z","Most awesome Wizarding World set","<p>I never had any Harry Potter set, and this is my first one. And not disappointed. It&#39;s a very good &quot;starting&quot; set since it has so many main characters, like Harry, Ron, Hermione, Draco. The others are exclusive to this set and totally worth it. Hagrid looks amazing. A lot of minifigures...</p>

<p>There are 878 parts (+/- figures). The sand colored bricks are very useful for sand/desert mocs since there is a lot of them. I appreciate that they changed the sand green color to grayish for the roof. I really like the accessories, and some I never had, like brooms (instantly 2 pieces), or teapot. Since I love gems, I&#39;m pleased with these crystals (especially the 2 new color) and gems. The is a big and small cauldron which is again, amazing accessory. I don&#39;t have to say, how much I wanted a boat, and finally got it.</p>

<p>Maybe the price is a bit too much, but thinking about the details, accessories, it&#39;s worth it.</p>

<p>Overall, this set is a must have. If you&#39;re a Harry Potter fan, you must get this (Think about Hagrid!)</p>

"JVM","2018-08-29T09:36:27.17Z","Two Steps Forward, One Step Back","<p>After a long hiatus, LEGO makes a strong return to J. K. Rowling&#39;s <em>Wizarding World</em> with this impressive and detailed rendition of Hogwarts&#39; Great Hall, an iconic location feature in every film and book in the <em>Harry Potter</em> franchise. An array of exciting minifigures and accessories make for a promising set, but can it meet years of anticipation?</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>With the relaunch of the <em>Wizarding World of Harry Potter</em> theme, LEGO has started from scratch like never before with a completely different stylistic approach to a familiar theme, discarding familiar elements that lasted through the original theme&#39;s long history such as the trademark sand green roofs.</p>

<p>The Great Hall is an excellent choice for a headlining set, serving as one of the series&#39; most iconic locations, appearing in all of the books and films, serving as where Hogwarts students and professors typically have breakfast, lunch and dinner, a frequent place both for the central student characters to socialize as well as for serious story-related announcements, usually from Professor Dumbledore. It also saw occasional usage for purposes such as the Dueling Club lessons or for safeguarding younger students from battle outdoors.</p>

<p>The location was first rendered as one of the two larger castle pieces in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4709-1/Hogwarts-Castle"">#4709 Hogwarts Castle</a>, the theme&#39;s first flagship set, accompanying the film release of <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone</em> although these early sets shared many elements based on the books and franchise branding, such as Peeves&#39; presence in the set. This version of the Hall was taller than either subsequent release, with a rocky fireplace and multiple play levels, if severely lacking in interior space for the actual tables. (One of my earliest mods as a young LEGO fan was to expand it.)</p>

<p>The location was not revisited until the final film in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4842-1/Hogwarts-Castle"">#4842 Hogwarts Castle</a> as one of four buildings included. This version was shorter and smaller than the previous, but offered a much more modern take on the building, with a significantly larger interior, an entrance door, and window frames under the arches. The expanded interior includes a pedestal and two staff seats, as well as long tables and seats for the two available houses. However, the orientation of the interior placed the tables vertically from the windows instead of horizontally, leading to some calls for something more screen accurate.</p>

<p>Like the previous iteration of the theme, this set uses technic connections to suggest/offer expansion. While the last incarnation of the theme primarily used the 1x2 Brick with two technic holes (<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4523145/brick-1x2-m-2-holes-%C3%B8-4-87"">#4523145</a>) allowing multiple sets to connect compatibly, the connections have been altered for this incarnation. The use of two 1x1 bricks with a single technic hole, with four bricks in between suggests stability, but the loss of the second hole connection for each makes up for it. Nonetheless, these connections fit with the castle section included in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75953-1/Hogwarts-Whomping-Willow"">#75953 Hogwarts Whomping Willow</a>, a set released in the same wave. I will cover this below under &#39;Expansion&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The more things change, the more they stay the same. Many of the special parts long associated with the Harry Potter theme have been phased out or disappeared entirely over the years, but some persist. A large cauldron is included in the set, along with a variety of crystal pieces to act as part of potions. The large spiral staircases of the earliest sets aren&#39;t back in full force, but a half staircase is included. Two broomsticks are available for a quick flying lesson on the fly. The classic hidden chest is back. Owls use a similar mold with updated prints. The House Cup trophy sits behind the professors, ready to be given out to the victors of the year&#39;s competition. There are also four of the new white candle element.</p>

<p>The exterior includes some more unique parts - a large boat, similar to that from the first castle, which can hold multiple minifigs, with a small brick-built lantern to light the way. Two massive doors that lead to the entrance of the Great Hall are also included and look very impressive in person.Small spire pieces are littered throughout the exterior, along with an even thinner green wand-like piece, with an additional new piece in gray (2x4x4) to represent small castle roofs, slightly larger than the cones used atop previous castle roofs.</p>

<p>The most notable new part in my opinion, however, is the Sorting Hat! This enchanted, sentient hat that decides your place at Hogwarts has appeared before as a wizard hat in black, and a printed brown wizard hat -- here, however, it has a unique mold that includes impressive detail to represent the folds of the hat&#39;s &#39;face&#39;, yet remains open enough to fit atop a minifigure&#39;s head to recreate the sorting process!</p>

<p>Additional pieces I found interesting or notable were the two banners, with stickers to represent the houses, the white teapot, the golden frog, the smaller cauldron, the jungle spider, the green leaves, microfigures as a statue, green leaves, and the other pieces to represent pastries. The chest is filled with the familiar gem/stone/diamond piece in multiple colors, including the red of the Philosopher&#39;s Stone, and finally, there&#39;s a new rat, possibly a version of Scabbers, who has a special place in Harry Potter lore.</p>

<p>As covered below under Minifigures, there are also many new minifigure elements, including the debut of four completely new hair styles, and others in new colors, as well as the debut of the new wands and a few special accessories like Hagrid&#39;s pink umbrella and the new lantern element.</p>

<p>Though not a &#39;part&#39;, it should probably be mentioned there are high number of stickers in this set, concentrated heavily in the Great Tower - many of them make up exterior details, and several more are used to recreate the Mirror of Erised.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>For the theme&#39;s relaunch, a considerable number of radical changes have been made to the minifigure presentation, especially for the students. Out of ten included minifigures, four have newly molded hairpieces, and at least three include brand new colors for existing pieces -- while this might sound typical, three of these new hairpieces replace pieces first issued for the original Harry Potter theme when it began! In addition, while the early years of the theme had capes represent the characters&#39; cloaks and outer robes, including all students, Snape, Dumbledore and more, these have been retired, with all robes printed on, though the versions of the students included here exclude them.</p>

<p>All of the students are based on their appearances as eleven-year-old &#39;first years&#39; in the first film, <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone</em>, and are now rendered with short black legs that lack articulation. While this clearly depicts them as children, I personally found it jarring and as mentioned below, it affects the build. The new Hogwarts uniforms are also a radical change, with a usual dark gray body, but with the printed tie and collar half of the size as in previous versions, with a stripe at the bottom corresponding to the same house as a tie again, and the badge again removed.</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Harry Potter: </strong>The iconic character himself makes an appearance here with a brand new touseled hairpiece and the same new double-sided head across all sets, with a grin on one side and a scared expression on the other. He wears the new Gryffindor uniform, which form the basis for all house uniforms -- a small area exposing a tie and undershirt, with a large gray sweater and a colored stripe representing his house, with the tie and stripe matching colors - in this case gold and red for Gryffindor. He also has short black legs, and is equipped with a dark brown wand.</li>
	<li><strong>Ron Weasley: </strong>Harry&#39;s best friend and most common companion in bricks, Ron has the same new double-sided head across all sets, with a grin on one side and a terrified, upset expression on the other, with Luke Skywalker&#39;s moppy, touseled hair in red. He wears the same Gryffindor uniform described above for Harry, and is equipped with a bright brown wand.</li>
	<li><strong>Hermione Granger: </strong>The brightest witch of her age, Hermione Granger is rendered with a special new hairpiece that perfectly represents her large, bushy hair in the first two or three films, along with a unique new double-sided head that appears with her in all sets, with a smirk on one side and a scared expression on the other. She wears the same Gryffindor uniform described above for Harry, and is equipped with a tan wand.</li>
	<li><strong>Draco Malfoy: </strong>The only Slytherin student released in this wave, school bully Draco has a similar hairpiece to his last appearance, slicked back but in a brighter yellow, and a new two-sided head with a smirk and an furious look. He has a unique Slytherin torso with green and silver in the tie and stripe. He&#39;s equipped with a dark brown wand.</li>
	<li><strong>Susan Bones:&nbsp; </strong>A new character debut and at long last, a Hufflepuff! Portrayed in the first two films by director Chris Colombus&#39; daughter, Susan has reddish hair in a neat, newer style with a previously used cutesy &#39;young girl&#39; double-sided head. Not to be confused with Ginny Weasley, she&#39;s also wearing the long sought Hufflepuff uniform, with a yellow and blue tie and stripe. She&#39;s equipped with a dark brown wand.</li>
</ul>

<p>The set also includes five minifigures based on Hogwarts&#39; teachers anf hosts:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Rubeus Hagrid: </strong>The most radical reinvention among the adults, Hagrid once again shares a regular minifigure scale head, with a new design here. The old rubbery black hairpiece is replaced by a hard (ABS) plastic one in dark brown. A new body, slightly smaller and less rounded is introduced, with standard short brown legs representing his boots instead of attached feet. Standard minifigure hands are attached to special new arms, with connect to the central body via technic, ala bigfigs. The new body piece has molded with pockets again in orange-brown and has a beautiful print. Hagrid is equipped with his pink umbrella-wand, reusing the new mold for the Penguin&#39;s umbrella, and the new lantern piece. It&#39;s a beautiful update, although for all of the changes, it&#39;s hard to imagine these pieces seeing future use for other characters.</li>
	<li><strong>Albus Dumbledore: </strong>Based on the Richard Harris portrayal of the character in the first two films, he&#39;s a shining star in the set. Although the previous Dumbledore hairpiece was molded uniquely for the character when the theme was new, the newer piece for this year has softer details, offering some bright potential for the future of minifigures. The beard, meanwhile, is ironically the same piece used by Gandalf a few years earlier, again in gray. He has a unique double-sided head, one side with glasses and one without, that is special to the Harris version of the character, with unique wrinkles and hair detail. His torso and legs are depicted with detailed dark red robes, unlike the purple of the original minifigure. The figure does not include a cape/cloak. He is also equipped with a tan wand.</li>
	<li><strong>Minerva McGonagall: </strong>Marking her third appearance, the re-designed McGonagall wears a classic wizard&#39;s hat in black, technically accurate but nonetheless looking mismatched, along with a two-sided head with both smiling and stern expressions - the hat does not cover the second face well. Her body and legs are molded in dark green with some black printing. Unlike previous versions of the character, she has printed standard minifigure legs instead of either version of the skirt/dress element. She is equipped with a dark brown wand. The figure does not include a cape/cloak.</li>
	<li><strong>Professor Quirrell: </strong>A welcome update to a character not seen in over fifteen years, Quirrell uses a newer revision of the turban headpiece that is significantly more detailed, in a lighter lilac rather than the deep purple of his first variation. His body and legs are molded in black, perhaps a bit too dark a color in my opinion, with the tail of his turban printed in lilac, although I believe such a physical part with the tail does exist. The front of his head is printed with a mischievous smirk that feels both fitting his initial, somewhat weak nature, while still reflecting the later truth about him. The back of his head has a print of Lord Voldemort&#39;s face, replicating the minifigure that created the practice, although this wrinkly print is intentionally lopsided to reflect the film version better, though I might have preferred it straight. He is equipped with a bright brown wand. The figure does not include a cape/cloak.</li>
	<li><strong>Nearly Headless Nick: </strong>Never before issued as a minifigure, LEGO&#39;s hopes to emulate the Ghost of Gryffindor Tower involve rendering him with white &#39;skin&#39;, with the other pieces in shades of light and dark gray. He has another unique, two-sided headpiece, with a smile on one face and a brown on the other, with the recent &#39;Doc Brown&#39; hairpiece in gray. He also has a uniquely printed body and legs molted in gray. I&#39;m a little surprised they didn&#39;t include a proper separate collar piece, but it certainly could&#39;v made this simple minifigure bulkier. He has no accessories.</li>
</ul>

<p>It should be noted that the minifigure selection is inspired entirely by the events of the very first film <em>Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone</em> (2001) when the child characters were all eleven-year-old first years, and this is reflected by the inclusion of Professor Quirrell most obviously, but also by the use of Nearly Headless Nick and Susan Bones, both of whom only appeared in the first two films, though present for later books, and the distinctly Richard Harris&#39; version of Dumbledore, who also only appeared in the first two films. The collective minifigure series includes older versions of the main trio and Dumbledore, reflecting their appearances in the later films.</p>

<p>The Sorting Hat is also something of a character, but I described it above, as are Fawkes and the Basilisk, discussed below due to their brick-built nature.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Naturally,the overall build process begins with some of the smaller side pieces, none of which are very complex, before moving on to building the larger central structure, mostly working from part of the interior and building outward, before later returning in.</p>

<p>The main Great Hall is a little repetitive to build, as you do have to construct literally dozens of windows, now with panes, as well as the pillers around them, and later the same spires above each. This is accurate and attractive but of course repetitious. A little more complexity is involved in building the archways and doors to both the Hall and the Tower, featuring some asymmetrical features and finer detail, although nothing that should challenge any experienced builder.</p>

<p>I found myself surprised by the Tower structure, which broke from the format established in the theme&#39;s previous iteration, where most towers were built around the octagonal plates - here, the internal areas favor dark tan floors over gray, using quarter-circle plate elements that allow for a wider area at the expense of depth, returning to familiar techniques from older castle towers by using rounded wall elements, and of course a window in the middle. A few earth orange bricks add flavor. This tower also has a heavy use of stricker.</p>

<p>The roofs are where we see some slightly more refined building techniques. The Great Hall uses some black technic pieces and droid arms to create the floating candle effect, as well as to hang the Hogwarts banners, while also serving as a firm support skeleton for the roof, which features additional little slope detail. A significant amount of work is also spent building a tall gray roof to the Great Tower that is ultimately taller than any of the previously used molded roof elements, although the striking plate pieces look a little jarring against a smooth back.</p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly a satisfying build and naturally takes a good amount of time with the included pieces, but this probably still isn&#39;t a set for someone looking to learn any advanced master building.</p>

<p><strong>Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>The finished model is a fairly imposing creation, taking up a larger footprint than any previous individual castle buildings. While much of this is simply due to the appropriately large size of the hall itself, the presence of the large door and docking area result in the Great Tower sticking a little further/deeper out from the main &#39;rectangular&#39; shape of the hall, rather than directly parallel. In terms of height, while the Great Tower is sufficiently tall and looks as such next to the towers from most previous sets, the Great Hall is actually much shorter than <em>both</em> previous iterations, almost half the height of the oldest hall included in #4709, and in my opinion, comes off looking a little small/undersized from the exterior.</p>

<p>The exterior is significantly more ornate than previous editions, and taking a closer look, one has to be impressed with the level of detail included. Green leaves and small rockwork create a sense of a larger environment, with some of the rockwork situated on dark blue pieces to suggest the nearby Black Lake, although they look a little jarring. The odd earth orange pieces add a sense of age and texture to the brick work, appropriate for an ancient castle. The proportions of the turrets to the rest of the hall has never looked more screen-accurate. As a downside, the docking area is a little structurally weak and the &#39;railings&#39; can easily be damaged. The boat does fit nicely in the area though, and there&#39;s room for Hagrid to greet a few students in front of the door.</p>

<p>The Great Tower stands tall and impressive, with an arch with its own window and turret leading to the interior, which is marked on the bottom by a broom and a golden staircase, with a pillar at the corner. The staircase is welcome but doesn&#39;t leave much room for anything else. The second floor contains two cauldrons and some potions, which made for a fun section, while the third floor seems to be some kind of storage room, offering a stand for the Sorting Hat, and a treasure chest for the gem stones. The instructions also place a black jungle spider here.</p>

<p>The Mirror of Erised, a separate piece, is the intended highlight of the Tower, positioned in the top &#39;attic&#39; within the tower&#39;s tall roof section, sitting just outward with a space to maybe hold one minifigure in front. The mirror is constructed here using pearl gold pieces and at true minifigure scale, though it relies on stickers to recreate many of the mirror&#39;s back details. Interchangeable panels allow it to depict the desires of four different minifigures - Harry, Ron, Prof. Dumbledore and Prof. Quirrell. When the mirror is removed from the tower, a brick-built version of Professor Dumbledore&#39;s phoenix Fawkes can be found adorning a perch behind it.</p>

<p>While the inclusion of the Great Tower is welcome, the scenery choices feel a little miscellaneous. The second floor, for example, offers some useful and interesting odds and ends as a Potions room - but the actual Potions Classroom is located in Hogwarts&#39; dungeons, and included with sister set #75953 alongside potions teacher Professor Snape, making its inclusion here superfluous. The proper place for Fawkes and the Sorting Hat to be stored, meanwhile, would be in Professor Dumbledore&#39;s office, which has previously been depicted twice. The Mirror of Erised looks marvelous itself but fits into the castle oddly, leaving little room to stage a scene in front of it, which is odd given how much action takes place near it in the film. (Though it is superior to the versions in sets such as <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4702-1/The-Final-Challenge"">#4702</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4867-1/Hogwarts"">#4867</a>)</p>

<p>The interior of the Great Hall itself is surprisingly rich, with brown scenery and windows highlighting the otherwise tan walls and gray floors, and provides a number of contrasts to previous editions. The tables are now oriented accurately to canon, with the long house table oriented horizontal and the staff table vertical to both the main outside windows as well as to the builder, while the previous had them oriented the opposite way for play. The previous edition included the Headmaster&#39;s Podium, which is once more omitted to allow for the return of the longer staff table, with #4842&#39;s fancy chairs exchanged for simple ones, save the headmaster&#39;s chair, ornate as in the first edition. The House cup trophy sits behind them in a brilliantly set of windows sticking outward, replacing a single lackluster one used in the previous version. The entire staff area is slightly raised to suggest a stage for sorting.</p>

<p>For the first time, four long tables are provided for each Hogwarts house, allowing the new Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw students to join in. This comes at a considerable cost, as each table is only given a single bench, represented by a lone 8x1 plate - though a standard minifigure can still sit there, the included students&#39; short legs do not bend anyway, so the benches cannot even be used. The lack of secondary benches means you must display your students standing behind the table, which looks ok for display but I cannot hide my dissatisfaction with such a solution. Each table is, at least, adorned with a treat or two, including a teapot, a mug, and a drumstick, though these lack the whimsy of the cake and turkey included in the previous edition.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, a technic solution allows for house banners and candles to hang above the Hall, and while these are a key part of the environment, the short stature of this edition and orientation of the tables mean these components feel a little in the way during play in addition to sticking out some. The Hall is completed by a fireplace, calling back to the first edition, with a few flames and a nice brown hood. The aforementioned large brown doors open directly into the Hall, skipping the Hogwarts&#39; Entrance Hall but allowing for new first year students to move from the dock right to their seats, adding playability.</p>

<p>The final piece of the set is a surprising choice - a brick-built basilisk, based on the creature seen in <em>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</em>. This is a repetitive little build that allows for a lot of articulation with the final snake, which has an opening and closing jaw. While it&#39;s a cute sub-model, it doesn&#39;t look anything more like the basilisk than any kind of brick-built snake might. It makes sense that Fawkes and the Basilisk were added to increase playability, but neither creature appears in the Great Hall at any point, and their inclusion alongside Professor Quirrell, who is entirely exclusive to Philosopher&#39;s Stone, make for an awkward contrast.</p>

<p>While it is perfectly understandable that LEGO cannot produce things at exact scale, the model overall tends to feel a little shorter than it should be, and this results in a lot of areas feeling a bit cramped for play, such as the rooms of the tower and the interior of the hall. I imagine this could have been improved by just adding two standard bricks&#39; height across the board, allowing for another row of windows and a little more space in the Towers, probably not adding too much to the price. I also feel it may have been better for play to keep the inaccurate table orientation with fuller chairs.</p>

<p>It be worth noting the final model is generally stable, but there are some weak points, particularly the dock railing which comes apart easily. The Tower and Hall are only connected by door arches and thus the Tower can come apart a little easily as well. It&#39;s also possible for the two large plates to come apart if they are not&nbsp; The turrets can also be detached easily, and some of the spires. Most of this isn&#39;t a serious issue.</p>

<p><strong>Expansion</strong></p>

<p>Both ends of the structure, offer technic connection pinholes, suggesting potential future expansion for a larger Hogwarts castle as previous editions often promised, though as mentioned above they do not follow the same connections previous sets used. The connection, however, does fit in with the castle section included in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75953-1/Hogwarts-Whomping-Willow"">#75953 Hogwarts Whomping Willow</a>, a set released in the same wave.</p>

<p>While previous expansions tended to place Hogwarts buildings standing parallel to each other with a similar depth, this is a much less consistent one, with much of the &quot;Dungeon&quot; castle section sticking out from the Great Tower - in fact, the tower&#39;s stairs cannot be left open as they will interfere with the lantern in the Potions Classroom! This cuts off access to the little Potions storage area from the Great Hall as well, forcing these areas to feel separate rather than complimentary. Though the second floor is at least at a similar scale with the tower&#39;s second floor, the rest of the dungeon is diagonal, creating a very uneven floor plan for the combined set, albeit in line with Hogwarts itself.</p>

<p>I honestly found myself disappointed with the expansion element, as while the sets covered different castle areas, they did not feel like they were built to fit together, particularly when viewed from the interior for play. I felt as if another unreleased castle section is supposed to bridge between the two of them, and simply did not see release or may have been held back for a future wave. They look much better on display when viewed from the exterior, and this is the only way I plan to display these two sets together in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Here, I would like to divide my points into a simple bulleted list of what is best and worst about the set.</p>

<p><em>Pros</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>Excellent minifigure selection including all but a few major characters, a wide variety of new pieces, and some all-new characters.</li>
	<li>A number of fine details are lovingly crafted into the exterior of the Great Hall especially, from rockwork to small spires.</li>
	<li>Much more screen accurate overall exterior and interior, including overall orientation, compared to previous releases.</li>
	<li>A number of uncommon and rare pieces, including minifigure elements, the boat, castle turrets, microfigure statues, and much more.</li>
	<li>Designed to be compatible with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75953-1/Hogwarts-Whomping-Willow"">#75953 Hogwarts Whomping Willow</a> to allow for creating a larger castle.</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Cons</em></p>

<ul>
	<li>The overall set can feel a little cramped in some places, particularly due to the Great Hall&#39;s much shorter size in this edition.</li>
	<li>The Great Tower interior contains some interesting pieces but does not really offer any notable rooms or locations from the series.</li>
	<li>The technic solution used to represent the &#39;floating&#39; candles and hold the banners up, is a little too unsightly in my opinion.</li>
	<li>The seating for the four tables included in the set cannot be used well by the included student minifigures</li>
	<li>The brick-built Basilisk and Fawkes, while welcome additions that add playability, would have probably been better suited elsewhere else.</li>
	<li>A high numbers of stickers, especially those that need to be applied to walls or round surfaces, are always prohibitive to a set.</li>
</ul>

<p>As a matter of personal preference that should not affect the rating, I miss the sand green roofs and old school uniforms.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusions</strong></p>

<p>This is an impressive set and improves in my ways upon its predecessors, delivering a set that is not only undeniably worthy of headlining the <em>Wizarding World</em> range but manages to be both play-friendly and an excellent representation of the source material, with many unique parts and an excellent minifigure selection, offering an almost comprehensive collection for the theme in a lone box, and the bricks to build an impressive castle area. However, there are many things that could still stand to be improved, from a better height to a better candle mechanism, leaving this a set a little short of a perfect score. Despite these flaws, I would <em>still</em> highly recommend the set as it offers a wide variety of characters and pieces in a kit that, for once on a rare occasion, feels almost generous for its price point!</p>

<p><strong>Hagrid- </strong>Great minifigure with new torso piece and hair and beard piece with short legs under the torso. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The Hogwarts&nbsp;Great Hall is a fantastic build. It is a little incomplete on one side but on the other side is great. It gives nice playability with the open side but looks off. The interior is good with tables and benches and has the house banners. The tower has the sorting hat in it which is a nice new piece and has the mirror that Harry Potter looks at in the first movie that has multiple choices for the mirror. Behind the mirror is a place you can put Fawkes the Phoenix which is a great brick built creature. This set also includes a brick built Basilisk that isn&#39;t needed and looks bad and incomplete. This set can also connect with the Hogwarts Whomping Willow set.&nbsp;Overall the build is great and looks great on display on one side and looks incomplete on the other. 9/10</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>This set is great, it looks really good even though it is incomplete on one side. The minifigures are all great with a lot of new pieces for some of them. The Basilisk looks bad and doesn&#39;t need to be in this set but everything else is good. If you are a fan of Harry Potter then I definitely recommend this set.</p>

"Wacky_Wookiee","2018-12-20T05:32:28.26Z","Probably one of my favourite Harry Potter sets","<p>I got this set yesterday with some holiday money from my grandparents. Having received the Womping Willow for my birthday a few months back, I was excited to add this set to it. So, what did I think?</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>- Minifigures (particularly Quirrel, Dumbledore and Hagrid)</p>

<p>-Main build is incredibly detailed with lots of room for role-play</p>

<p>- $160 AUD is a really good price for what you get</p>

<p>- Fun building experience, except for a small issue with the entrance</p>

<p>- The flags are stickers, not prints. &nbsp; &nbsp;This means you can put them up in any&nbsp;way you wish (Ravenclaw forever!!!!!!!)</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>- Doesn&#39;t connect well with the Womping Willow set. You won&#39;t be able to move&nbsp;the hidden staircase next to the potions classroom for example.</p>

<p>- VERY tall. You may have to remove the very top of the tower to fit it on a shelf.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the Great Hall is phenomenal. I really recommend this to any Harry Potter fan. You don&#39;t really need the Womping Willow ( maybe except for Filch and Snape) to complete it. This set is exceptional on its own. I&#39;m sure that this is one of the greatest sets of the year.&nbsp;</p>

"George_W_S","2019-04-30T21:31:59.667Z","It's good but not a great hall","<p>Overall, the 2018 line of Harry Potter sets are great. However, the Hogwarts Great Hall wasn&#39;t as good as I thought it was from original pictures.</p>

<p>Minifigures: 10 figs is great for this set with a great bunch to set up different interactions from the philosopher&#39;s stone and chamber of secrets. Harry, Ron, Hermione, Susan Bones and Draco are a great bunch but it would have been good to get some representation for Ravenclaw especially as this is a great hall set. Teachers are fantastic with great new molds (especially Hagrid). Nearly Headless Nick is fantastic as well.</p>

<p>Exterior: The hall section has brilliant detail and looks like the real thing. No further comment needed for that side. However, the tower to the right really put me off from getting the set immediately as it looks out of place, bland and flat. I&#39;m not really sure what else they could have done but it just doesn&#39;t sit right with me.</p>

<p>Interior: I&#39;m not the biggest fan of play sets, but this set does have great interior to play and display. There is enough space in the great hall for figures. The set would have to be a DTC to have enough space for good tables and seating. The tower has tight interior but it doesn&#39;t look too bad. The inclusion of a space for the mirror of erised is odd in my opinion. But still as I mentioned before, the set would have to be much bigger to get some detailed interior that would look like proper classrooms.</p>

<p>Other Parts: Basilisk is terrible and a waste of parts, we need a good chamber of secrets set to get a proper basilisk. The boat is a nice addition for play to act out the scenes from the first movie.</p>

<p>Side note: When connected to the whomping willow set there is a problem with the staircase</p>

<p>So overall, the set isn&#39;t perfect but still is a nice play set and display piece. Minifigures 10/10. Interior fun but not that detailed and Exterior generally good. Nice array of parts including double-cheese&nbsp;slope pieces. I would recommend!</p>

"MartinCurtis","2020-03-08T20:30:43.783Z","Very fun to play with - you can use it to act out all of the films.","<p>I like it because it&#39;s got a lot of detail in it - like the head table and the little fireplace - and a place to park a boat just outside.</p>

<p>All the characters can find their place within the model.&nbsp; It can also join onto the Whomping Willow and Clock Tower sets.&nbsp; I&#39;ve only got the Whomping Willow set at the moment and it looks really good joined together.</p>

<p>The Mirror of Erised is a great feature with different reflections for different characters.&nbsp; There&#39;s a moving staircase that leads up to Dumbledore&#39;s office.</p>

Minifigure curate e molto varie. Ho comprato a parte e aggiunto il pezzo trasparente (quello che si usa per le scope volanti) per collegare il fantasma di Nick e farlo fluttuare in aria sulla sala grande. Divertente da costruire e altamente giocabile.</p>

"Tristan_The_Lego_Lover","2023-02-08T21:44:37.777Z","Great set to start your Lego Harry Potter castle!","<p>The hogwarts great hall (75954) is a great set. The hall consists of four tables that can seat three&nbsp;people each and&nbsp; there is the&nbsp;table for the teachers which has three seats and in the window behind the teachers&#39; table there is a trophy. There is also a fireplace to the side in the hall. The tower starts with moving stairs at the bottom. The first room in the tower is what seems to be a potions&#39; room that has&nbsp;a&nbsp;couple of cauldrons and some flasks and jewels. The second room is Dumbledore&#39;s office which has the sorting hat a phoenix and a chest with jewels. The third room in the tower is the room with the mirror of erised&nbsp; and includes mirror slides of harry ron dumbledore and quirrell. The outside includes a small dock and courtyard space in front of the doors. The set has ten minifigures the bird named hedwig a boat and two broomsticks and also a small&nbsp;basilisk snake.</p>
