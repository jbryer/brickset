<p>The set itself is not a big one, it will fit easy in any display location. As usual with Ideas-sets you don&rsquo;t need to worry about lots of stickers, not one is there, everything is print.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So to get the parts via bricklink or other sites like it, will probably&nbsp;be challenge.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building</p>

<p>There are not thousands of parts, so it is rather quickly done. There are a few bricks, that you will not see often, also a few nice tricks how to get the shape right. I do like the minifiguers&nbsp;also, I was a bit concerned the guy with the black helmet just got a blank dummy head, but positive surprise, a real LEGO-head.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playing</p>

<p>Well, you will not be able to play the actual game as depicted in Tron and Tron Legacy. Yes the wheels turn and the body does not scratch on the surface, but they do not have any kind of rubbercoating&nbsp;so no real grip. And the light-walls are just these 2 pieces you see.</p>

<p>These are mainly and foremost display models.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>The set is nod to the Tron movies, where the Light bikes and the game did play a huge role, they are iconic features of the films. So that&rsquo;s why I titled the review throwback to old times. Tron was a fantastic movie at the time it was released, it does stand up to today&rsquo;s movies also quite well, in my humble opinion. As a fan of the movies, I do like the set. You have also a lot of printed and/or rare parts, so the price is OK. Just don&lsquo;t forget, that Disney will for sure collect some fee as well.&nbsp;</p>

"vikings","2018-12-27T19:49:22.54Z","Good Set-Not Worth the Money","<p>I must say I really liked the movie, so I was really excited to see Lego Ideas come out with this set. Being a fan of&nbsp;Tron&nbsp;it was nice to see them give the movie a set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>The box was very different from the traditional Lego set boxes. The box had some flaps on the it that tuck into the rest of the box, which I have never seen from Lego before.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There were some unique parts such the large dishes for the wheels and then all the trans-orange and blue pieces used on the Lightcycles&nbsp;and stand/track.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>In this set you get three figures: Sam Flynn, Quorra, and Rinzler. The detail on all of them is incredible and they did a really good job on all the printing on all three of the figures. Sam Flynn comes with his helmet and his hair piece. He also comes with disc. Quorra&nbsp;comes with a blue disc as well and has a silver ninja sword. She also has printing on her&nbsp;arms. Rinzler is my favorite of the three in the set. The detail on him is amazing. The helmet on him is just awesome with sleek design on it. My only critique on it would be is that they didn&#39;t do a custom mold for the discs. I&#39;m not a fan of the 2x2 circles as the discs. They don&#39;t really work for them to hold in there hands for display in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was pretty easy took me under 20 minutes to build it. The bikes are exactly the same build just different color pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:</strong></p>

<p>Once I finished it, I was really happy with my purchase. The lightcycles&nbsp;are really nice and resemble the ones in the movie. The track is nice especially nice to get for display and that you get the track for the bikes to be on as well. All the figures are great and have tons of detail on them.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Overall this is a great set (Not for the price). The bikes are great and the design of them is really good and accurate to the movie. All three of the figures are great and have a ton of detail on them. The track is really nice to have to display the lightcycles on. With the exception of the price and my opinion that they should have made a a custom disc instead of the 2x2 circle for the disc, it is a really great set and I&#39;m glad that they gave the movie a Lego set. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-07-31T17:31:56.663Z","Disney and Ideas Work Well Together","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #21314 Tron Legacy:</b> Ideas seems to enjoy giving us fun and unique Disney based sets. We&rsquo;ve had Wall-E, Steamboat Willie and the famous Light Cycles from Tron Legacy specifically. I half expect Ideas to bring even more Disney inspired sets to the forefront. Which would be pretty interesting if we got to see some more great iconic Disney items or characters. LEGO&rsquo;s partnership with Disney has resulted in many impressive sets over the years. Tron Legacy is a bit more niche unfortunately. Which means the set is not for everybody and seems to be fairly easy to find despite retiring this year&hellip; although to be fair LEGO&rsquo;s finally sold out of it, as soon as it went down 30% off a lot of people must have ordered it. I know I did, and so it may be harder to find after Black Friday 2019.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Welcome to the Grid is the only thing missing from this sets packaging. The box shows off a very detailed artistic shot of the Game Grid complete with racing action going on, you can see the live action CGI shots from the movie and then a recreation of that race scene with the physical LEGO set. Each aspect of the model is showcased on the back and markings are everywhere showing off the basic concept of LEGO Ideas and the set in general. It&rsquo;s a very detailed package design, which isn&rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing, but you may prefer something less dark in colours. The box is rather dark looking.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual features write-ups on the designers, the creator of the initial set and the world of Tron and the specific characters from this set. A fairly decent design, but I do admit it was a tad odd seeing the creators of this set as Minifigures.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">For an Ideas set, this is pretty light on parts. Most of the elements by design need to be black, so you won&rsquo;t see a whole lot of interesting colours, but there are still a few items. Four printed clear orange and blue large dishes are featured for the tires, there are large clear blue and orange banners/windows with bars on one end we see more in Classic Space or LEGO NEXO Knights. And of course the smaller printed identity discs each character has on their back.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Quorra: The design on the Minifigures in this set are fairly impressive. The level of detail for the characters is extremely accurate, we see a lot of detail for the glowing lines that they characters have when inside the Grid. Quorra is one of the main hero characters and a person from inside the computer. Her outfit has detailing on the legs, a double-sided torso and printed arms. She uses a bowl cut hair piece we first saw around the middle of the early two-thousands. I believe it was introduced with LEGO Indiana Jones and specifically Irina from Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Her accessories include two katana, which I don&rsquo;t recall her using in the movie, a printed identity disc which attaches to a clear back bracket and she has two distinct facial expressions. Frowning and Smiling. Overall a decent looking character.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Rinzler: Known as Tron in the original, Rinzler is a corrupted computer program which has been enslaved and forced to work for Clu, the main antagonist of the film. He carries two Identity discs because of this and features a very detailed print with a lot of finer details based on the costume we saw in the film. He wears a full facial mask, which is a familiar looking design, I believe it was first introduced with Marvel Super Heroes for Iron Man. The facial print underneath is rather neutral and could represent any emotion outside of rage or anger. He&rsquo;s a bit too indifferent for my tastes and doesn&rsquo;t include any alternate printing on the back of the head.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Sam Flynn: The son of the original film&rsquo;s protagonist is equally detailed with a lot of printing on the legs and torso for his costume as seen in the Game Grid. So basically his computer avatar form. He features a single identity disc and a spare hair piece so that when he isn&rsquo;t wearing his helmet. Speaking of which the helmet for him is a bit odd, it&rsquo;s a regular half helmet we see on most helicopter pilots in LEGO City, but is using the diving helmet bubble shield from LEGO Atlantis. It just looks odd and I can&rsquo;t seem to figure out the best way to get him to wear it to capture the proper look of the on-screen appearance.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: The build in this set is very samey and broken between two bags. The first includes all three Minifigures and the display base meant to be part of the Game Grid. It&rsquo;s a fairly decent if repetitive build with some nice SNOT designed execution to make for a very tiny section of roadway.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: This is also repetitive because the two models are identical in build except for the colours of some of the elements. Overall though it&rsquo;s a very impressive build, making some very nice looking Light Cycles. These are upgraded as the original movie designs were slightly different from Tron Legacy&rsquo;s designs. This is built for display though as the wheels do not turn.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Light Cycles are pretty iconic in the world of Science Fiction and these two vehicles look great on a shelf next to the DeLorean and even the Ecto-1, but they are identical in design and execution. Also, as I noted above their wheels do not turn very well, they aren&rsquo;t built with traditional LEGO wheels and so the models make for more of a detailed display set rather than a set to be played with. This is reflected with the age range, at it is aimed at 10 and up. I&rsquo;m not sure if it is just my copy, but the base display stand is also very off-balanced. It likes to slide around a lot when on display and seems a tad warped with some of the plates, making it not flush when put on the desk.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The way they made the light walls for the two models is fairly creative though, pretty enjoyable looking set, but as I noted before it isn&rsquo;t made to be a toy. But overall is still very much appreciated.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;d recommend this set for any Tron Legacy fans out there, LEGO fans might get a kick out of it, and if you&rsquo;re both you&rsquo;ll probably enjoy displaying this next to other sets. The problem with the set though is it is a highly repetitive build and the display base has some issues. Overall, I am glad I got it before it sold out, and glad I waited for a sale, but I only recommend it for those who are interested in getting it. Compared to some of the other Ideas sets I&rsquo;ve built, this one isn&rsquo;t the most ground breaking, but it is nice to have another Disney property represented in LEGO form. Recommended.</p>

"J14T14","2019-04-29T18:14:01.36Z","It is Always the Movies That You Least Expect...","<p>When ever we get a LEGO set based off of a smaller movie/ property that end up being some of the best built and have the most detailed minifigures&nbsp;(ex. Gremlins, Power Puff Girls, Wall-E, Ghost Busters, etc.). This is probably because LEGO is only going to make a few sets based of of these licences then forget about them. Because of this, designers who are fans of these properties do the best job they can so that other fans of these movies/ tv shows get a fantastic product. A lot of love goes into these sets, more then the Star Wars, Marvel, and DC sets, and are therefore more memorable. This is certainly the case for this set.</p>

<p>The minifigures included are Sam Flynn, Quorra, and&nbsp;Rinzler. All the minifigures are well detailed and included Identity Disks (Sam and Quorra include one blue one each and Rinzler has two orange ones).Sam has a helmet&nbsp;and a hairpiece, Quara just has a hairpiece, and Rinzler has a helmet&nbsp;(Many people say that the mld that is used for his helmet&nbsp;is overused, but it works perfectly here). My favorite detail is Quorra&#39;s tattoo on her arm that identifies her as being a ISO (the last known one).</p>

<p>The light cycles themselves rest of a well build base that looks really nice when compared to the movie. The connect to two studs each (due to the wheels, they only connect to the top halves of the studs and don&#39;t fully connect. keep this in mind when carrying the set). The light cycles themselves are identical builds, just swapping out the orange and the blue elements with each cycle. The flag pieces used to represent the trails&nbsp;that they leave behind them work perfectly. The wheels spin and can move when in contact with a higher friction surface like carpet. The main thing that I do not like about this set is that there is no place on the stand to display Quora. She is forced to be set on the side.</p>

<p>Overall, I really liked this set. I tried to get it the week it came out at the LEGO store in downtown Disney, but they had just sold out the day before. Now that I have it, I don&#39;t mind that I had to wait. It looks great and was a really fun build. Even if you have never seen the movie, this is a great set to add to your collection and I really recomend this to all fans of LEGO.</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2020-07-04T06:33:29.48Z","Fantastic set, not so good value","<p>So I saw Tron: Legacy once and thought it was a decent movie, I pretty much saw it just so that it could convince me to get this set which I thought looked pretty cool. The figures and the light cycles have always impressed me, though what took me quite a bit of time to get it is the sudden desire to get it last year... and also the price.</p>

<h3>The Builds</h3>

<p><strong>The Grid:&nbsp;</strong>I like this representation of the grid, it&rsquo;s made up of a lot of plates and tiles in black and translucent blue to make a very simple yet visually appealing design. There are 1 by 2 jumper pieces to place the light cycles and make them look like they&rsquo;re racing and it looks really good on display. The jumpers also double as spots to place your minifigures for a disc battle. Overall, a simple but effective design that does its job in the set very well in being a display stand for the main builds.</p>

<p><strong>The Blue and Orange Light Cycle:</strong> keep in mind that the 2 light cycles included in this set are identical builds but with slightly different color variation to match the minifigure who uses it. In terms of how this is built and how it looks, it&rsquo;s pretty darn good. I think the designers of the set nailed it with the design of these cycles, having it look pretty futuristic as well as using very interesting pieces that took advantage of newer parts at the time of release to make the vehicle look very sleek. The color scheme is pretty consistent with the black and blue (or black and orange) as well. The space where you fit your figure to drive the bike requires you to position the legs of the figure a little bit backward and it will fit pretty well, and of course, you have the figure holding on to the controls, the minifig looks pretty awesome driving the bike. The wheels were pretty well handled for the most part, I like the printed dishes they used for them, the prints came out very neat, but I have a problem with the wheels, I wish that the bike would be able to roll smoothly. How they were connected to the build was using a pole piece through a connector peg piece, and that unfortunately doesn&rsquo;t allow for smooth rolling with the wheels, either that or probably because it was brick built and not using any rubber pieces, but at the end of the day, I understand that this set seems more like a display piece than a play piece, so I can kinda excuse it, I still wish the designers found a way around it though. Lastly, I liked how they used a translucent banner piece to represent the trail left behind from the bike. Overall , despite my one problem with it, it&rsquo;s an amazing build with good details, a sleek design and it makes for an excellent display piece, especially when attached to the Grid.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs&nbsp;</h3>

<p><strong>Sam Flynn:</strong> Starting up the phenomenal lineup of minifigures of this set is Sam Flynn. He has some great&nbsp;&nbsp;printing on the legs and torso and even some fantastic arm printing for the black and blue armor design. He comes with a clear neck attachment to connect his identity disc, the disc itself was an awesome printed 2 by 2 circular tile. His face prints look nice with a smile and a stern face, and I think it fits the way he looked in the movie, unfortunately, these face prints that were new for this figure didn&rsquo;t stay exclusive as it was used for Viktor Krum in the Harry Potter sets. Finally, you have the &ldquo;spiky hair piece&rdquo; (as I like to call it) in medium nougat and they also give you an option to swap it out for the black and translucent blue helmet which was pretty nice. Overall, while this figure is my least favorite of the 3, it&rsquo;s still pretty incredible with the impressive amount of detailing and accuracy to his appearance in the movie.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Quorra:</strong> Yeah, this is my favorite minifigure of the 3. I really like the detailing of the black and blue armor on the torso where the blue lines even carry on from the torso to the hip and onto the legs, it&rsquo;s some incredible printing. Her arms are also printed with the continuation of the armor design and even some flesh as well, I&rsquo;m surprised on how it came out because when light colors are printed onto darker ones, they don&rsquo;t turn out great, and here, it looks perfect. Like Sam, she has the clear neck attachment to connect an identical printed circular tile piece of the identity disc. Her exclusive face prints include a smiling and a scowling expression and they both look nice, I don&rsquo;t think her hair piece is exactly hard to get, but it&rsquo;s my first one of this piece and I liked getting it. Finally, her other accessory is a sword. Overall, I&rsquo;m very happy to have this figure in my collection, the printing is very impressive and the figure looks like how she was in the movie , I love this figure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rinzler:</strong> Rinzler is my second favorite figure of this set, like the other 2 Minifigs, his printing is just top-notch. The printing from his torso to the hips and legs is amazing, his torso is black with a tinge of orange and it looks great, he has no arm printing, but he looks fine without it. He uses the neck attachment with a technic pin on it to put his 2 identity discs, the disc prints are pretty much the same as the other 2 but with orange this time, I liked how they were able to give him his 2 identity discs as he is the only fighter in the grid to wield 2 discs. His face print underneath the helmet is unfortunately a common one that appears in a lot of Star Wars sets, I honestly would&rsquo;ve rather had a plain black head instead, but it&rsquo;s not a huge issue since you&rsquo;re gonna have him wearing the helmet most of the time. And finally we get the very clever part usage for his helmet, usually, Lego tries to use the invincible Iron Man helmet on different characters as kind of experiments to see if it works well, most of the time it doesn&rsquo;t *cough Wasp *cough, but it was used perfectly for Rinzler here and it ACTUALLY looks good on him. Overall, he&rsquo;s another highly detailed and collectible minifigure and the pieces on him are great, he makes a fine addition to any Lego collection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Value for Money&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This is where the set kinda fails, it&rsquo;s the pretty bad price. 35 bucks really doesn&rsquo;t feel worth it, 20 would&rsquo;ve been amazing, 25 would be reasonable, 30 would be pushing it, 35 is ridiculous. I mean, this does feel like a premium set with the elegant builds and Minifigs and even down to the box and instructions, and I also get that licensing fees are a thing, but it still could&rsquo;ve been more reasonably priced. For me, I was fortunate enough to have the full price of the set lower than the US full price where I live at a price of $27,5 and I also got it on a 10% discount so I ended up paying $24,8. I&rsquo;m still judging the value score with the full price though.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This set is fantastic, the builds are near perfect and the figures are phenomenal and pretty much look like they came from a Disney minifigure series, because their level of quality is just that good. It&rsquo;s very clear that Lego put presentation above all else in this set and it shows, it does feel like a collector&rsquo;s set more than the recent Avengers sets for example. Unfortunately, the price does weigh it down a bit, I got it at a pretty decent price at least, so from my personal experience, it&rsquo;s fine. I will still rate the set a 5 star since I&rsquo;m focusing on what&rsquo;s actually included in the set for the Overall rating and what was included in the set was an impressive model that looks incredible on display. I highly recommend getting this set if you can find it for a reasonable price, it makes a worthy addition to anyone&rsquo;s collection.</p>
