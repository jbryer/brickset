"CoffeeBrickMan","2018-05-27T10:50:35.94Z","Arctic Glider Go","<p>The smallest of the new City Arctic sets for 2018, revisiting the sub theme from 4 years ago.</p>

<p>This new edition has the same predominately Bright Orange colour but with the addition of Earth Blue and Dark Azur parts which complement the orange very nicely.</p>

<p>The set has a single minifig with earth blue legs, a dark azur torso with great printing front and back. The head has printed blue goggles/visor over the eyes, and he is wearing a dark azur hat.</p>

<p>To accessorise there is a walkie talkie, an ice saw and Flame Yellowish Orange snowshoes.</p>

<p>The Ice Gliders itself is a simple but satisfying build with 4 earth blue runners, a fan at the back to drive the vehicle over the ice, a Transparent Light Blue canopy piece on a clip so it can open and close, a steering wheel (rather than handle bars), and a printed 2x2 bow piece with the new City Arctic 2018 symbol which is reminiscent of the previous 2014 city arctic symbol.</p>

<p>The glider has 2 clips and a vertical bar to store the figures gear when not in use.</p>

<p>While the overall theme for this years Arctic sets looks to be animals frozen in the ice - this set does not have anything in that line. Instead it has 2x transparent orange mini cones and a printed 1x2 flat tile which look to be some kind of navigation or triangulation &#39;thing&#39; which seems like a simple and fun play feature.</p>

<p>Overall a great little set and well worth the &pound;5 price tag. An excellent start to the theme I think.</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<p>&raquo; Good minifigure.</p>

<p>&raquo; Good vehicle.</p>

<p>&raquo; All the tools and accessories an explorer needs.</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<p>&raquo; The set does not come with any fossils for the explorer to discover.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>The set is good because it has all the tools an explorer needs and a good vehicle but in my opinion the only thing missing from the set was a fossil for the explorer find because this is the only artic set of this year&nbsp;that does not come with any fossils for the explorer find&nbsp;until the polybag 30360 Arctic Ice Saw has a fossil.</p>

<p>I recommend buying this set.</p>

<p>the minifig is a well designed little guy and he matches the other Arctic crews. Really like the hat on his head.</p>

<p>only drawback is the skid tend to hook in unleavened surfaces during playability but other than that I enjoy it.</p>

<p>i can see me getting a few more of these.</p>

"Minifig290","2018-11-06T18:17:56.61Z","Surprisingly Refreshing","<p>Hello all,&nbsp;today i&rsquo;ll be reviewing the&nbsp;&nbsp;City Arctic Ice Glider that was released to coincide the Summer 2018 City Arctic&nbsp;Sub-theme, Retailing at &pound;4.99/&pound;6.99 with 50 parts this set has a price per part of 10p/14c. Let&rsquo;s have a look at this great set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>This set contains one of the common characters for the sub theme being released in 1 other set and a polybag. His hat is a dark azure knitted cap with no print, his face has a pair of blue tinted goggles with his eyes showing through, while he has a concentrated mouth. The explorers torso is printed onto a dark azure torso showing a coat with a utility belt and a radio device, the print continues to the back of the torso and finally a unprinted pair of dark blue pants.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>There are many different accessories for a set of this size including a chainsaw, a radio and pair of snow shoes in orangey yellow. Also two 1x1 trans orange cones are used for cones or markers, but the most interesting accessory is a hard to find 1x2 dark gray tile with a satellite view with some points of interest marked. All the accessories and the figure can either fit or be attached to the glider.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Now onto the main attraction of the set the glider, the build is built around a speed champions car base in black. There are four dark blue skis in the set that are used to move the glider around. Orange is the base colour of the build, this is used around the cockpit that has&nbsp;a white steering wheel and 1x2 cheeseslope for a backrest and studs to sit the figure. Also a printed orange slope with the arctic logo is on the front&nbsp;Also orange is used at the back that holds the gliders propeller&nbsp;and presumably the engine&nbsp;as two grills are at top. Also the back area has clips and a bar and studs to hold all the accessories comfortably. The last mentionable feature is a trans light blue cockpit cover that when closed sits onto some studs on the side.</p>

<p><strong>______________________________</strong></p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To conclude the reveiw i&rsquo;d definitely say for the &pound;5 ($7) price its worth picking up either for yourself or as a gift, this set would definitely make a great stocking filler this Christmas&nbsp;without a doubt.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Great Parts throughout, cool figure, great accessories, nice printed parts</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>None to mention</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-11-06T23:44:14.073Z","Cool, but not cool enough ","<p>My son got this for his 5th birthday and it was the first Lego set he decided to open. He actually thought it was pretty cool as he had nothing else like it and really enjoyed some of the unique parts to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, he has never taken it out to play with since. Without super heroes, storm troopers, police, or firefighters, it just isn&rsquo;t interesting to him. After all, how many 5 year olds know anything about Antarctica that doesn&rsquo;t involve penguins. Plus, It doesn&rsquo;t really fit in well with any of his other sets, and I&rsquo;m not about to buy more polar sets when he doesn&rsquo;t like this one.&nbsp;</p>
