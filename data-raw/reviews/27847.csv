<p>This new edition has the same predominately Bright Orange colour but with the addition of Earth Blue and Dark Azur parts which complement the orange very nicely.</p>

<p>We have 3 minifigures in this set:</p>

<p>First, an explorer woman with earth blue legs, dark azur nicely printed torso, a printed head with visor/goggles and a dark azur hat. This is essentially the same figure as in the smallest set (60190) with a female head. She is accessorised with an ice saw and Flame Yellowish Orange snow shoes.</p>

<p>Next we have photographer with black legs, red printed torso, a smiling bearded face, and an excellent fur lined red hat. Not surprisingly he has a camera.</p>

<p>Finally we have a driver with earth blue legs and torso, the later of which is printed front and back. His quirky smiling head wears a new dark azur helmet with white clip on goggle visor piece.</p>

<p>To accompany the team is a single husky which looks great, and nice to see in a smaller set.</p>

<p>The vehicle is a snowmobile, quite similar to the snow mobile (60032) from the 2014 arctic sets, with earth blue runners, 3M black technic beams presumably representing drive tracks, handle bars for steering and a printed 2x2 bow with the new Arctic symbol. The snowmobile has space to seat a second figure behind the driver.</p>

<p>The vehicle also has a simple trailer with a couple of clips for accessories, and carrying a transport crate.</p>

<p>The final mini build is a small snow/ice block. The front piece can be &#39;cut off&#39; with the ice saw to reveal a frozen animal (this being the activity/theme of the Arctic sets this year). The frozen animal in this case is a tiny insect frozen in (printed on) a Transparent Light Blue round 1x1 brick. (<em>Maybe it has some dinosaur blood frozen in its ... - oh, that&#39;s a different theme/series.</em>)</p>

<p>Overall a good set. The mini figures are excellent, as is the inclusion of a husky. The vehicle is perhaps a little basic, but the space for a passenger and trailer with crate are good for play value. The frozen insect is maybe not as impressive as the animals in the larger sets but it fits with the overall theme, and probably as much as might be expected at the piece count/price tag of this set.</p>

<p>As with the old arctic theme, this one also appealed to me by its bright colors and nicely designed minifigures and the abundance of gear with every set. This particular one had no special appeal to me, I just needed to get a total of 50&euro; at the store for reasons. So I bought this small &quot;Starter-set&quot;-like thingy.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Seventy. What to expect? Standard parts in white, gray, orange and blue. We have a pair of large skiers for the sled, a camera and a container as what you could call &quot;special&quot; parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Giving it the mentioned &quot;Starter-set&quot;-character, it comes with four (!) minifigures: a male pilot for the motor-sled (he has a cool helmet!), a female researcher, who seems to be quite hot, wearing only glasses and a bonnet, a bearded male guy with a nice cap with earmuffs and a cool looking husky, which I already knew and liked from 4 years ago!<br />
You also get some gear, which is a buzzsaw, snow boots, a camera and a storage container.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very, very simple. Should be done in 5-10 minutes. You start with the minifiures (of course), followed by the sled, the trailer and the ice/snow-chunk.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is always nice to see what you can do with so little parts! Sure, everything looks very simple and basic, but I liked how the motor-sled is designed with the large skiers and the small Technic-parts in the back acting as crawlers. The trailer is VERY small, but has everything it needs: skiers, a storage place for the container (alt. the guy in red) and two clips for the boots and the buzzsaw.<br />
The snow/ice-chunk is a nice addition, since something like this is in every Arctic-set. Also, since no small animal minifigure would fit in there (like in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60192-1/Arctic-Ice-Crawler"">60192</a>), I find the solution with the printed-on insect on the round &quot;ice-crystal&quot; quite good.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is the only &quot;starter-set&quot; I bought for myself and have to say, those 7&euro; were worth it. Surely, this is nothing to put up on display along with your collection, but it is always nice to see that there is still good LEGO for little money. The amount of minifigures gives it a good playability and nice possibilities to be combined with other arctic sets, even the older ones.</p>

<p>And hey, it contains a husky, ain&#39;t that great?!</p>
