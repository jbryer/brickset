<p>There have been real world legged walking forestry machines so its not implausible, though I suspect it would be too complex for such a harsh environment, but who cares - it looks cool.</p>

<p>The pieces come in 2 numbered bags, and there are 2 small instruction books (one for each bag).</p>

<p>Bag/Book 1 starts with the single minifigure in the set. He has Earth Blue legs, a printed Dark Azur torso, wears a dark azur fur hat and is accessorised with an ice saw and a red mug (hopefully with a hot drink).</p>

<p>Next up is the small ice structure, consisting of just 10 pieces for the base, and another 5 pieces form the &#39;frozen&#39; block holding the themes frozen creature - in this case a mouse.</p>

<p>The final 3/4 of the book details the vehicles base core, in Dark and Medium Stone Greys and Earth Blue - the colour scheme for the Arctic vehicles, with a thin (1 plate high) Dark Azur line through the middle. Built in what feels like too many small steps we add the 4 hinged top leg sections, each built independently (even though the diagonal pairs are identical). Then the bottom of the main body which includes a seating/cab area with a control level, and 2 lights (removable as torches) clipped either side of the cab body.</p>

<p>Bag/Book 2 picks up with the upper body of the Crawler, with a medium stone grey core and Bright Orange outer and upper cover pieces (with a couple of stickers). There is a clipped Transparent Light Blue cockpit piece which can swing up for access to the cab, and a small side structure with a click hinge base.</p>

<p>Attached to this side structure is the manipulator arm - built from 3x 4-stud click hinge beams (with 4 stickers), and a rotatable 4 clawed grabber.</p>

<p>The 4 legs are built in (diagonally opposite) pairs, with earth blue bottom, dark and medium stone grey middles and bright orange (with one sticker) uppers, using click hinges for a solid posability. The feet are a technic gear with a flat side on a pivot pin which allows them to rest easily on angled surfaces or bumps.</p>

<p>The Crawler is different and interesting for that. It is also quite posable with the movable legs and clawed arm. It does however have a few flaws.</p>

<p>Just a single minifigure is disappointing, its an ok figure, but not unique either, also appearing in 60195 Arctic Mobile Exploration Base.</p>

<p>The cab on the vehicle does not rotate, which I think would have been an improvement for playing with grabbing the frozen mouse block out of the ice structure and rotating the cab to put it down elsewhere.</p>

<p>The 2 instruction books seems to be an excess with ~90 pages of instructions for 200 pieces total, adding just 1 or 2 parts for many pages/steps. Perhaps they&#39;re designed for younger kids to manage?</p>

<p>The price per part is the best of the Arctic Sets (UK price at least), and the set has its good points, but it is the least appealing as a build and as a set of this years Arctic sub-theme.</p>
