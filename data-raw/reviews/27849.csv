<p>This set comes with 3 mini figures, a husky and a polar bear (not prehistoric or frozen in ice!).</p>

<p>The snow bike rider has Earth Blue legs, an Earth Blue printed torso, a cheesy grin, and a biker helmet with goggles. He comes equipped with a mini brick built ice corer tool (more below), and a printed &#39;triangulation&#39; tile.</p>

<p>The figure with the black legs, red printed torso, dark azur gloves and a lovely red fur lined hat is apparently a biologist (and cameraman). He comes with a video camera</p>

<p>The third figure has Earth Blue legs, a Dark Azur printed torso, and a dark azur thermal hat. She is the truck driver, and is equipped with a radio.</p>

<p>The husk is I believe the same as in the previous Arctic sub theme from 4 years ago - and is carrying a pair of binoculars &#39;slung&#39; on its side.</p>

<p>The snow bike uses a new bike base, with a front clipped ski and a mini chain around the back, with a standard bike faring in Bright Orange on top. The chain runs smoothly and the bike drives along on various surfaces just fine.</p>

<p>The feature vehicle is the Scout Truck. The front tracks and double rear big tyres raises it up high for good terrain clearance, although it has no suspension mechanism for climbing over obstacles. It follows the same basic colour scheme as the other vehicles in the sub-theme being Bright Orange on top, a stripe of Dark Azur in the middle, and Earth Blue on the bottom. A large Transparent Light Blue windscreen gives the driver a good view out front. The roof section is removable, giving access to the drivers seat and a rear control station, with (stickered) keyboard and display.</p>

<p>The onboard display matches up with the printed &#39;triangulation&#39; tile (carried by the snow bike rider), and the 2 transparent orange cones on the first ice structure - locating and identifying something in the ice. These &#39;triangulation&#39; pieces are also present in 60190 &#39;Arctic Ice Glider&#39;, making a nice combination of these 2 sets.</p>

<p>The truck has space in the open back to carry the snow bike, the rear folds down to give easier access, and there is a clip and a bar to carry gear, and space to store the orange &#39;triangulation&#39; cones and ice corer too.</p>

<p>The polar bear comes with a small ice structure which looks like the entrance way to an ice cave, presumably the bear&#39;s lair/den. The polar bear is a live native animal, and not a frozen prehistoric sample the explorers are looking for.</p>

<p>The second ice formation houses a neat little play feature. Behind the 2 transparent light blue windows are 1x1 brick &#39;holes&#39; into which small round brick/plate &#39;cores&#39; are placed. One is just snow/ice, the other includes a round transparent light blue brick 1x1 with a frozen (printed) insect. This is presumably what the triangulation beacons have located. A mini figure with the ice corer tool can put it onto the core and extract it from the hole in the ice structure.</p>

<p>There are 8 stickers, all for the truck - including the new Arctic symbol and set number on the each side, and the keyboard and display for inside.</p>

<p>This is a pretty cool set, the price is slightly high for the piece count, but that is offset by several larger pieces (including the polar bear). The truck and the ice bike are great vehicles and both drive around smoothly.</p>

<p>It also combines well with the 2 smallest sets (60190 Ice Glider and 60191 Exploration Team) which provide an additional set of &#39;triangulation&#39; pieces and an addition frozen insect.</p>
