I was supposed to use the bricks it contains in order to build a house-themed creation. What I came up with was rather messy (I was only 6, give me a break!), but at least I got to keep the set... which was sweet!

It contains 2 large blue baseplates (quite valuable & hard to get, mind you!), a nice pile of different bricks, roof tiles, plates & so on and it all comes packaged in a nice suitcase with 6 separate containers (as long as you don't remove the plastic parts, in which case you'd have 2 larger containers). The suitcase is so useful that I still use it to this very day to hold my more ""specific"" bricks.

Back in the 90s, this one was a great set at a very reasonable price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
