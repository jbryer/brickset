"Bison_Bricks","2018-06-11T05:02:16.673Z","Mammoth-sized Fun!","<p>LEGO can be commended for improving upon the strong collection&nbsp;of City Arctic sets released in 2014. The updated color scheme, a greater variety of minifigures, the&nbsp;refreshed logo, the inclusion of&nbsp;scenery and the new focus on prehistoric animals all add up to an intriguing new storyline.&nbsp;The largest (and in my opinion the best) among these sets is&nbsp;<a href=""https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Arctic-Mobile-Exploration-Base-60195"">Arctic Mobile Exploration Base.</a></p>

<p>For most LEGO fans the&nbsp;mammoth is the star of the show! It looks great, and removing the preserved specimen from its frozen&nbsp;housing&nbsp;makes for a fun experience. The ice cave design is a little too symmetrical to look natural but that makes it easy to re-assemble in play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mammoth is removed using a four-wheeled ice cutter machine that I feel is the weakest part of the set. Kids will love the chunky tires and over-sized blade, but it looks a little too aggressive for delicate work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mammoth can be moved using the biggest vehicle, the crane, which sports a rugged,&nbsp;imposing design that looks like it would have no trouble in the snow. It fits two minifigures:&nbsp;a driver and a crane operator. One quibble: the layout of the six wheels make it difficult to turn.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mammoth can be placed on a large sled, which can also hold cargo and the snow bike in place of the mammoth. This build is strictly utilitarian.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mammoth and other finds can be analyzed in the mobile lab, which offers lots of natural light through its many windows, a work table with equipment, a bed for when you need a nap (and a&nbsp;coffee maker to help you stay alert). The lab is small but well-designed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eight minifigures, two cargo containers of minifigure accessories&nbsp;and a&nbsp;really nice&nbsp;snow bike complete the set. Also, the ability to connect pieces together in&nbsp;a &ldquo;train&rdquo; formation is great.</p>

<p>This is the premiere set in the 2018 LEGO City Arctic line. I would choose this set over multiple smaller Arctic sets (although <a href=""https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Arctic-Supply-Plane-60196"">Arctic Supply Plane</a> comes in at a close second).&nbsp;Wonderfully-designed and packed with play features, this set is highly recommended!&nbsp;</p>

"CoffeeBrickMan","2018-07-11T10:07:07.213Z","Arctic Train","<p>This is the largest of this years Arctic sets, and it looks like a really cool set.</p>

<p>2 large wheeled vehicles, one with a crane arm the other with a large circular saw; a mobile lab on skis; a trailer with a snow bike and a load of gear; - all of which can be linked into a great long mobile vehicle chain. Plus 6 minifigs and a Mammoth frozen in a snow/ice block.</p>

<p>This set also has more pieces than any of the Arctic sets from 2014.</p>

<p>In the box there are 6 numbered bags, 4 instruction books and a sticker sheet.</p>

<p>Book 1 and Bag 1 provide 3 minifigs, the snow bike, a couple of crates of gear and the mammoth in the snow/ice block. The first minifig is an explorer/climber with 2 ice axes. This figure has excellent printing on legs, torso and head with climbing harness, rope and radio. The second figure is in full arctic gear with a pneumatic drill, and the third is a driver/rider for the snow bike wearing the new helmet and visor.The mammoth uses several preformed pieces, but looks pretty good with a turning head. The ice bike is the same as the one in 60193 Arctic Scout Truck - with a new body, with a mini chain drive at the back and ski at the front - it looks pretty good and the chain moves nicely on hard and soft surfaces. The crates of gear are simple enough, with a small hook attachment for use with the crane, also from the box pictures the hook attachment is used to lift and move the mammoth. The ice/snow block which contains the mammoth is moderately substantial, with 4 easily detached encasing pieces (intended to be &#39;cut&#39; from the block by the saw bladed vehicle.)</p>

<p>Book 2 and Bags 2 and 3 build the saw bladed vehicle and the snow trailer, and provide 1 minifig. The minifig has a printed torso with what appears to be arctic standard explorer, and is wearing the new furry hat. The saw bladed vehicle is solidly built, the cab has a removable roof to get the driver in and out, a tow bar which folds up at the back, and a connection point at the front to take a tow bar connection. The big saw blade is new for these sets, appearing here and in the bigger saw machine in 60196 Arctic Supply Plane. It is attached by 2 sets of click hinges giving it good articulation. The only minor point is that the first section of the saw arm cannot fold flat onto the vehicle body as it is a little too high. The blade spins well from the side gears if they&#39;re not squeezed in too tightly. The snow trailer is simple but solid with 4 sets of double skis for it to slide around on, and multiple anchor points for the various gear, snow bike or mammoth to be carried.</p>

<p>Book 3 provides instructions for bags 4 and 5. Bag 4 builds the mobile lab and provides 1 minifig. Bag 5 builds the body of the crane vehicle and provides a second minifig.</p>

<p>The first minifig has printing on the torso, is wearing a thermal hat and has a radio - he may well be the expedition leader. The mobile lab has lots of windows, a door straight to the outside (the sticker on the door says &quot;Please Keep Door CLOSED!&quot;). The lab is equipped with a work bench with a camera on which there is a bone under examination. There is also a small coffee machine, a wall mounted display screen and a bench or maybe a bed up on high opposite the door. The lab has a folding tow bar at one end, and a connection point at the other.</p>

<p>The second minifig has a printed torso and wears a thermal hat. The body of the crane vehicle has a substantial solid base with axles for the 6 wheels, a large cab with driving seat with steering wheel and control seat for the crane operator. There is a turntable mount at the back (where the crane arm will be located).</p>

<p>Book 4 and Bag 6 complete the crane vehicle and the build. This starts with the orange cab body, which includes an interesting but simple construction for the rear window, mounting the same sloped window piece as on the front on its side. The cab has lots of windows for good visibility, a hinged roof for easy access, and there is a folding tow bar at the back. The final construction is the crane arm. This uses a Worm Gear Block (Element 4142824) which has been used in several sets, although this is the first I&#39;ve seen of it - it connects a worm gear and a gear wheel in a single block providing the simple mechanism to raise and lower the crane arm with the turn of a gear wheel, while providing the resistance to keep the arm in position when carrying a load. Lastly the wheels are mounted on the axles.</p>

<p>Overall a substantial and varied build, with lots of interesting parts. The build is easy enough, but did not over simplified. The set is centred around cutting the mammoth from its block, and then lifting it onto the trailer with the crane, and then hooking all the vehicles together and driving the frozen prize back to home base - but with multiple vehicles, the trailer, the lab and the snow bike, 6 minifigures and the mammoth in its ice block - there is a lot of play value in this set.</p>

<p>An excellent set, and worth the price (at least here in the UK - the US price seems a bit high!)</p>

	<h2><strong>The components of the set</strong></h2>
	</li>
	<li>
	<h3><em><strong>Lead unit&nbsp;</strong></em></h3>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>From the front and side, this looks amazing. It&nbsp;looks like a road train and the tires are massive for its size and provide a&nbsp;tiny bit of suspension.&nbsp; The cabin looks great, but only seats 2 minifigures&nbsp;which is odd for its size. The crane is used to get the mammoth out of the ice&nbsp;cave. It&nbsp;uses a worm gear to lock in position, but the clear case looks strange and the small connection to the boom looks impossible in real life. When lifting the included&nbsp;mammoth, if the black beam inside the boom is extended only by one stud the crane will fall off the turntable due to a weak connection. You can fix this by adding a short axle in the turntable to stop it from falling. You can then replace the 7L beam with a 15L one fully extended&nbsp;and it will hold. This set could definitely be without the crane, and I would have much preferred extra cargo space. This would remove the ability to lift the mammoth out of the included ice cave but getting it&nbsp;out of the ice is tricky&nbsp;anyway.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h3><strong><em>&quot;Base&quot;</em></strong></h3>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the &quot;base&quot; part of the set. This is built well and has a door on one side and 2 clips to hold saws on the other. It has&nbsp;some nice stuff inside, a table with a camera and a bone, a coffee machine, a computer screen, and a bed, this also only fits 3&nbsp;comfortably, one in front of the desk, one in front of the door and another in the bed. (it fits 4 uncomfortably.) The windows look awesome and let in lots of light. My&nbsp;only complaint is that on the door there is a sticker that says &quot;PLEASE KEEP DOOR CLOSED!&quot; (very nice addition) but it&nbsp;says &quot;STEP&quot; under that and there is no step, just a tow hitch. The way the roof opens is very nice and has a satellite dish on top. Wheels like the lead unit might have been better than skids on carpet.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h3><strong><em>Saw unit</em></strong></h3>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>This thing is cool and is used to get the mammoth out of the ice cave. It&nbsp;would be very useful for removing ice blocking the &quot;road train&quot;. You can attach a L motor to it and&nbsp;rip through the ice cave!&nbsp; However, In real life this would be too powerful to get the mammoth out of the ice.&nbsp; The joints use 2 click hinges per joint and that has so much friction that&nbsp;you can see plastic dust around&nbsp;the joints. The new saw is very cool and looks like it could do some damage with the teeth leaning in different directions. (<strong>With or without the motor it will make tiny dents in the ice cave and other LEGO pieces, so be careful!</strong>)&nbsp; It also has an axle holder in the middle with only 2 &quot;teeth&quot; inside it so it slides along the axle. it sits very low and the tires look almost oversized but still look good. They provide so much ground contact you can drop this thing off a desk and it won&#39;t break as long as it lands somewhat upright.&nbsp;There is an annoying 1x2 inverted slope shaped hole in the side, but it is&nbsp;there to fit a&nbsp;minifigure&#39;s arm.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h3><strong><em>Trailer</em></strong></h3>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Not much to say about this, but it looks good. It fits the mammoth, the bike, (not at the same time) the 2 included gray crates with lids and the crane mount for the mammoth. it also uses 8 skids rather than 4 like the &quot;base&quot; part. It also has 2 nice dark blue Technic beams.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h3><strong><em>Ice cave</em></strong></h3>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>Just a flimsy thing to hold the frozen mammoth. It does come with some nice trans-light blue rock panels.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong><em>Mammoth</em></strong></h3>

<p>This is a great piece, and it would be perfect if the legs could move in some way and the tusks didn&#39;t spin around so much.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h3><strong><em>Minifigures</em></strong></h3>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>6 very &quot;cool&quot; minifigures are included.</p>

<p>-The climber has a very cool masked face print with goggles, as well as some cool leg printing.</p>

<p>-The female &quot;ice bike&quot; rider is a nice minifigure with a great helmet.</p>

<p>-The guy with orange safety glasses and new hat design looks very good.</p>

<p>-The female explorer with parka is great and has a cool head print.</p>

<p>-The guy with the beard and dark blue jacket&nbsp;is nice.</p>

<p>-The very common male explorer with goggles is okay.</p>

<p>Overall, some epic minifigures, mammoth, 2 awesome vehicles as well as the base and trailer. In my opinion, this is the best arctic set you could get if not for the price. A price of $100 would be dreamy.</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h3><b><i>Accessories</i></b></h3>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>A new motorbike piece is included, but instead of wheels it has one small skid (a minifigure ski) in front and a tank-track sort of thing in the back that&#39;s made out of Technic chain. Two skids in front might have been better for balance but I don&#39;t think anything like this exists so thats okay.</p>

<p>Two light bluish gray crates with lids are a nice inclusion, but if you carry snowshoes in them they will come out if you tip the crate over.</p>

<p>For the minifigures&nbsp;there are 2 saws to cut ice and some snowshoes and some ice axes, as well as a radio.</p>

<p>A brick separator is in here too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<h3><strong><em>Conclusion</em></strong></h3>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>-A very cool color scheme over the whole set</p>

<p>-Somewhat pricey for what you get.</p>

<p>-Great minifigure&nbsp;selection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Epic vehicles.</p>

<p>-The only way to get the mammoth so far.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
