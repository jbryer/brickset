I wanted to give you a review of this set partly from the view of an AFOL train fan and partly from the view of it&rsquo;s target market; children 6-12. The passenger train has traditionally been the simplest and cheapest Lego train. The 60197 set follows in the path of the 7897, 8938 and 60051 sets in this regard. At 677 pieces, it has about half the number of pieces and is about 2/3 the price of the 60198 cargo train.</font></p>

<p style=""margin:0px 0px 10.66px""><font face=""Calibri""><font face=""Calibri"">You get five instruction booklets which allows several people to work on different parts of the build at once. I love this feature as it allows for a very social build among family or friends. The build is appropriately simple for the targeted age group and my eight year old built sections of the train with little assistance. Like most previous passenger trains however, the build is a little repetitive.</font></font></p>

<ol start=""25"" style=""list-style-type:lower-alpha"">
</ol>

<p style=""margin:0px 0px 10.66px""><font face=""Calibri"">Sixteen curved and four straight track sections are included allowing for a simple loop. Also included is a very simple platform and a signal pole. Minifigures included are a train driver, staff member in the dining car, and two passengers.</font></p>

<p style=""margin:0px 0px 10.66px""><font face=""Calibri"">This <font face=""Calibri"">train is very similar to the 60051 train. Aside from minor details, the main differences between the two trains are the colours, the fact that this train has one locomotive and two carriages, and of course it uses the new Power Up system. The new colours look fantastic and more modern than previous passenger trains. The set also has a new nose piece. This piece is shorter than previous versions, has no side windows, and allows for a hinged windscreen. This allows the driver to be placed or removed without removing the whole nose piece, which is an improvement. The shorter overhang is also an improvement, but it still leaves quite a bit of weight in front of and outside the front bogie on turns and makes the locomotive liable to derailment. I am not sure that most children care whether they get one locomotive and two carriages or the other way around, however this arrangement does allow for two sets to be combined to make on six-carriage train (as the 10233 Horizon Express did). Which brings us to the new Power Up system.</font></font></p>

<p style=""margin:0px 0px 10.66px""><font face=""Calibri"">The new Power Up system has a battery pack and incorporated Bluetooth receiver that is the same size as the old Power Functions battery box. It connects directly to the train motor that is the same size as the old Power Functions train motor. However, the new plugs and sockets are different and not compatible with Power Functions hardware. The battery has two sockets like the old Power Functions receiver however plugs can no longer be piggy backed on each other so each channel can only be connected to one piece of hardware. The instructions suggest adding lights to the train, and even give a set number for these (88005), however at the time or writing this set was not available. There are currently no Power Up accessories for sale on Lego.com but, interestingly, all the Power Functions accessories including train motors, lights, reversing switches and rechargeable batteries are still for sale on the Lego site. One clear advantage of this new hardware, is that the new battery and train motor occupy much less space than the old battery/IR receiver/motor set up. This allows for greater flexibility in train design, but it has to be said that this train does not take advantage of this as it is largely a copy of the 60051 train. This train could be retrofitted with Power Functions hardware with only minor modification.</font></p>

<p style=""margin:0px 0px 10.66px""><font face=""Calibri"">A Bluetooth replacement for the old infrared Power Functions system seemed inevitable and allows the train to be operated from a phone or tablet through the Lego Power Up app as an alternative to the included remote. The instructions advise that the app can be found on the Lego.com website but at the time of writing it was not available on the site. The app can be found in the Apple app store. It allows a phone or tablet to be paired to the battery/Bluetooth receiver. The app cannot be customised and each device can only easily operate one train at a time.</font></p>

<p style=""margin:0px 0px 10.66px""><font face=""Calibri"">The new Power Up system as it currently appears in this set is very rigid. One remote or device can be used to operate one battery box/receiver, which in turn can operate one train motor. All of the flexibility of the old system seems to be gone. You cannot set two or more receivers on the same channel so they can be operated together with one remote. This eliminates a lot of the creative play that was possible with the old system, for example to make longer trains with more than one locomotive. You also cannot plug two train motors into the same channel of the receiver to make a two-motor locomotive. </font></p>

<p style=""margin:0px 0px 10.66px""><font face=""Calibri"">The relevance of this with this 60197 set is that, even though you get half a train and the obvious thing to do is to buy a second set and make a full train, there is actually no simple way to combine two 60197 sets to make a working train that operates from one remote (other than retro-fitting them with Power Functions hardware).</font></p>

<p style=""margin:0px 0px 10.66px""><font face=""Calibri"">Pros:</font></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin:0px 0px 0px 48px""><font face=""Calibri"">Looks great.</font></li>
	<li style=""margin:0px 0px 0px 48px""><font face=""Calibri"">Relatively inexpensive.</font></li>
	<li style=""margin:0px 0px 0px 48px""><font face=""Calibri"">Simple build appropriate to the target age group.</font></li>
	<li style=""margin:0px 0px 10.66px 48px""><font face=""Calibri"">Power Up hardware less bulky than Power Functions set.</font></li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin:0px 0px 10.66px""><font face=""Calibri"">Cons:</font></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin:0px 0px 0px 48px""><font face=""Calibri"">Very similar to the previous passenger train.</font></li>
	<li style=""margin:0px 0px 0px 48px""><font face=""Calibri"">Not that much buildable Lego for the money.</font></li>
	<li style=""margin:0px 0px 0px 48px""><font face=""Calibri"">Power Up system not very flexible, and no extra components available yet.</font></li>
	<li style=""margin:0px 0px 0px 48px""><font face=""Calibri"">Can&rsquo;t easily combine two sets to make one train.</font></li>
	<li style=""margin:0px 0px 10.66px 48px""><font face=""Calibri"">Not many play features in this set.</font></li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin:0px 0px 10.66px""><font face=""Calibri"">Would I recommend this set? If you want a simple, relatively inexpensive Lego train for younger children, then it looks great and works well. However, the 60198 set costs 50% more but feels like much more Lego for your money. With this set so much of the cost is taken up by the Power Up hardware and track that you don&rsquo;t get that much train for your money. Spending a bit extra on the cargo train buys you a lot more Lego and the cargo trains offers a lot more play features and a more interesting mix of track pieces. </font></p>

<p style=""margin:0px 0px 10.66px""><font face=""Calibri"">Also, you might consider buying one of the older Power Functions train sets while they are still available (and possibly being discounted), even though this technology is being phased out. Power Functions hardware is still being sold by Lego and it offers more flexibility for experimenting with train set ups as children grow and build their own trains with the components.</font></p>

"CharmCityBrick","2018-11-28T11:27:05.683Z","Not impressed with the new Powered Up","<p>Overall, I find this train to be very much comparable to the white high speed passenger&nbsp;train from a couple years ago, build and look being about the same.&nbsp; I find it hard to digest that they raised the prices because of the new powered up system and that&#39;s where I actually find all my problems with this train.</p>

<p>So I bought two, because you kinda have to, to make it look right, which irritates me even more that I wasted my money.&nbsp; As an AFOL I do a lot of shows/events and simply put, the Powered Up system is worthless in this kind of public environment.&nbsp; I know that was put out as a warning, and they were spot on, way to many bluetooth&nbsp;and wifi signals in the air and it will never connect, so we converted it to the trusty PF system.&nbsp; I get it not working in the shows, but it doesn&#39;t work in my house either.&nbsp; Living in a city, where everyone pretty much lives on top of one another, way to many competing signals.&nbsp; Even in my own house, if I want to use the PU system, I have to go and start turning off everyones cell phones and believe it or not, our smart TV.&nbsp; go figure on that one.&nbsp; I find it to be a total pain and just not worth it.&nbsp; My advice if you want the train, wait for it to go on a deep discount, I know of two other people that returned them, because they just couldn&#39;t get them to work and they were not going to deal with the headache.&nbsp; BUT, if you live in the middle of no where, with not a lot of airwaves interference, than I would suspect it is a great system that eliminates the line of sight distance problem that PF has.</p>

"lego_team","2019-04-03T19:38:21.223Z","Great with the Kids (and alone)","<p>This is our first lego trains sets, and it is awesome.</p>

<p>The kids really liked it, and they did most of the building. There is the engine, which is cool and big, with very smart location for the Powered UP motor &amp; battery and the feature for the driver is great. The engine could have been improved by having the rear part with some passenger seats as well as moving forward a bit the front wheels.</p>

<p>There are two other cars, which are very nice - but I feel that 24 stud long is a bit too short, but the kids love it anyway. They are already doing police and other chases on the train. The dining car is very cool as well as the passenger car. As a general remark I understand all lego trains are 6 studs wide. This is a narrow compared to the rail, but very playable. 8 Stud would have been much better. Lego decision to include two cars instead of two engines is smart in my opinion.</p>

<p>This set provides hours of fun building it - and than many more hours of fun playing with it. I really liked the powered up system, it is more compact than the previous power functions but the main thing for the kids is lego powered up app - they really like it!&nbsp;<br />
I hope lego upgrade it soon to support multiple trains, and I feel that having more that 2 ports on the battery would have been better but for the average lego fan/parent it is a great system. There is also a private (free) software that allows to control multiple systems from a PC - long live bluetooth! I didn&#39;t have issues with the bluetooth btw.</p>

<p>Finally, a couple of downsides - I hate the stickers! this is really a pain in the butt. Also, the accessories are very bare. Only a small platform and lights systems. This is disappointing considering the price point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway I highly recommend this set.&nbsp;</p>
