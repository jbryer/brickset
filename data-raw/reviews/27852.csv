"CodeAlkemist","2018-11-27T08:49:35.38Z","A nice set with some playability and the nice new powered up system","<p>The set is very interesting comes nicely packaged in 12 marked bags and about 4 unmarked ones more on this later,the set is overall quite nicely&nbsp;executed the locomotive is not strictly based off a real life model but resembles a lot of European electric freight locomotives the German&nbsp;ones come to mind but they are not nosed like the one in the set some of SNCF(French)&nbsp;locos also come to mind, one critique I have is that the crane could have been made a static one in place of the control tower and be made into another type of rolling stock.</p>

<p>About the building experience, its quite nice and simple at least for me asd an adult who is quite proficient&nbsp;at putting LEGO&nbsp;together&nbsp;however one point where I draw a bit of concern is the unmarked bags some pieces are in those unmarked bags together&nbsp;with the tracks and that can be confusing if a child is assembling it, 16 curves and 16 straight and one point (switch) which allows for a basic loop with a siding and a level crossing (no gates on this one), it took me about 5 hours to assemble completely&nbsp;it&#39;s quite the build indeed.</p>

<p>The tracks and the overall set&nbsp;are nice if compared to the set 60197-1 (the passenger train) given that at a 70 dollars difference&nbsp;you get a 1470 mm&nbsp;by 740 mm&nbsp;track layout against 1010 mm by 730 mm from the passenger train.</p>

<p>The included tracks combined with the relatively cheap 60205 kit can make a quite large loop.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not referring to including a log cart in the title, but to the instructions included with the set. There is literally hundreds of pages of them. Every page only holds one step, and 90% of the steps only include putting on a single piece. It is ridiculous.</p>

<p>Older smaller lego sets used to have their instructions on one sheet of paper. I&#39;m not saying this should have it on one sheet, but even the forklift building instructions have 30 pages, the armoured car 60 pages. Jeez, if they were made with the same philosophy as older sets those would be 2 and 4 pages respectively.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And then LEGO brags about saving paper on box sizes. While they waste 100 times that on printing instructions.</p>

<p>This is my first experience with the bluetooth enabled Lego, and while it&#39;s neat it is mostly pointless.</p>

<p>What I dislike about the bluetooth powered up kit:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Even the slowest speed setting is too fast, there is no smooth speed control</li>
	<li>You have to pair the remote to the hub each time you turn it on, it does not remain paired.</li>
	<li>You cannot control two hubs with one remote at the same time. It would be great to control multiple trains with just one remote, maybe you can do that with the app? I haven&#39;t tried as the app has its own problems.</li>
	<li>The Android app itself is really inconvenient to use, pairing took 5 minutes, and the controls have a huge lag.</li>
	<li>UI customization is a pointless gimmick.</li>
	<li>The app often freezes not reacting to any input, hence it was taking so long to pair a single hub.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite the complaints I still recommend this set on value alone. It&#39;s a few years old now, and who knows how long until they stop selling it.</p>

However I do think that this set is extremely overpriced this is because of all the Technical features this&nbsp;set comes with.&nbsp;I recommend to wait for a good deal on this set as this occasionally comes on sale. Overall this set is amazing just very overpriced&nbsp;</p>
