<p>We get 2 minifigures with this set, a pilot and an explorer.</p>

<p>The female pilot is wearing a dark orange printed flight suit, with dark azure helmet and gloves.</p>

<p>The male explorer has dark orange legs, a dark azur top with printed rope and radio, a dark azur climbing helmet, and earth blue gloves and head (presumable some kind of balaclava or similar to keep his head warm out on the ice).</p>

<p>The explorer is equipped with an ice saw and 2 ice axes, all of which clip to the back of a quad bike in bright orange, with the printed arctic logo on front, and big tyres.</p>

<p>The pilot flies the quadricopter. This reasonable size helicopter is bright orange up top, has a dark azur&nbsp;stripe through the middle (shaped with stickers front and back), and an earth blue bottom, sitting on four dark stone grey skis as landing gear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cockpit is accessed through the removable front canopy. Behind the pilots seat is a winch mechanism. A gear on the outside top of the copter rotates the winch cable through to a hook hanging out the bottom of the copter. The 4 sets of rotor blades are mounted on angled sections built with orange a-frames, the rear sets are mounted slightly higher than the front sets.</p>

<p>The rear of the copter has a reasonable internal space, but this is inaccessible - the roof is not built to lift off easily and there are no rear doors or ramps - this seems like a wasted space which could have been used to house cargo, if not the quad bike (which would be too wide to fit).</p>

<p>The themes feature piece - the frozen animal, is a sabre-toothed tiger in an ice block, with a loop attached to the top so the copter can winch it up and fly it elsewhere.</p>

<p>The sabre-toothed tiger is excellent, and looks extremely lively for having been frozen.</p>

<p>There a 11 stickers total, all for the copter - the new arctic symbol on the top of the cockpit and the rear stabiliser fins, the sides, front and rear, with the curved dark azur stripe, and the set number on the side pods.</p>

<p>This is a great set, while it only has 2 minifigures, and the empty space in the rear of the copter seems like wasted space, the set feels like good value for money, has some great pieces, good play value, and a sabre-toothed tiger.</p>

<p>It makes an excellent addition to this years Arctic subtheme.</p>

"HuskyDynamics","2018-08-20T21:31:30.203Z","Arctic Air Transport","<p>This set is pretty cool. &nbsp;When I opened the box, the first thing I saw was that cool new saber tooth tiger element and then all the parts. &nbsp;This set has a lot of cool playability elements, including the winch setup, the saber tooth tiger ice block thing, and that chunky little ATV. &nbsp;So, here&#39;s my breakdown of this set:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<p>A very solid main build</p>

<p>Well-designed stickers that compliment the build</p>

<p>Nice&nbsp;color scheme (with some parts in fairly rare colors)</p>

<p>Saber tooth tiger</p>

<p>The guy with the balaclava - neat!</p>

<p>The rotors are staggered so they don&#39;t collide</p>

<p>The landing skids are very well balanced</p>

<p>The set is quite playable with a fair variety of features</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<p>A bit overpriced at $40&nbsp;USD</p>

<p>The ice block seems a bit hastily designed</p>

<p>The ATV front feels a bit incomplete</p>

<p>The winch setup is extremely stiff</p>

<p>As with many other&nbsp;LEGO helicopters, the interior is completely unused with the exception of the cockpit</p>

<p>When the rotors are spun, they vibrate and rapidly slow down</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this set is pretty nice, although some improvements could be made. &nbsp;That&#39;s kinda all I have,&nbsp;so... yeah!</p>

"Sobel","2019-02-14T21:57:04.3Z","Very nice fresh turn to the old helicopter-scheme, a lot for the money!","<div class=""description"">
<p>Helicopters, helicopters, helicopters... they are cool, but certainly, they tend to look a little the same after all the time. Not this guy! The design might seem a little odd, since it looks like an oversized drone, but I think it fits the unconventional, fictional style of the whole exploration subtheme of City (e.g. Volcano, Jungle, Miners...).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The 277 parts provide a good variety. Although most are the standard parts for a helicopter, including cockpit, winch and the inevitable large back part, you get some new angled parts to create the &quot;wings&quot; and some transparent &quot;ice&quot;-parts to create a large piece of ice.<br />
I also liked the large tires for the small ATV.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are only two minifigures included, which could be one more, in my opinion. There is a female pilot to steer the Quadrocopter, and a (I guess) male explorer who wears a face mask and snow goggles. He has quite some gear for his exploration, including two pickaxes and a buzzsaw.<br />
Additionally, this set presents you with a saber-toothed cat (Smilodon), which looks absolutely awesome!!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A rather easy build for an AFOL, the winches are always a little fiddly, especially here, where you have put the whole thing vertically. I just realized this set is a whole lot more difficult to rebuild after having dismantled it for the first time. I left the parts where the string runs through loosely attached to each other. This makes the build quite challenging at some point!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The obvious thing first: It looks cool! But apart of that, its also a cool toy to play with! Even though there are not so much functions to it, the combination of the copters winch, the ice-chunk and the ATV gives you some real good playing opportunities. I also like the design of said ATV, with the bulky tires making it look a lot bigger! Also, it has a place for all the gear to fit in, so everything&#39;s ready for exploring!<br />
The Quadrocopter itself only suffers one major flaw, the same as most of the helicopter-sets: wasted interior space. Just a simple cockpit, room for the winch and the large, empty back. Why not put a hatch there, like in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7903-1/Rescue-Helicopter"">7903 set</a> from 2006?<br />
The ice chunk is a very good addition, especially with that awesome Smilodon frozen inside! Only thing that bothers me here are those wide open parts where it seems like some ice is just... missing? Could have been done more nicely.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Very nice set, a great addition to my helicopter collection! I would like to see more helicopters with this design in the future! The composition of the sets parts gives you a good playability, nice minifigures and also some usable parts for MOCs. The whole Explorers-subtheme is a good thing that hopefully is kept alive by LEGO. The only major flaw was pointed out above, the well-known waste of space inside the copter.<br />
To conclude this review let&#39;s look at the price. The original retail price of nearly 40&euro; was crazy, most shops listed it for 29,99&euro;. And I got it on a special discount for only 20&euro;, which was awesome and TOTALLY worth it!!</p>
