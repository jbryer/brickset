That being said it is a nice price point for getting some sets if you&rsquo;re interested in the characters and don&rsquo;t have enough money. This set is fairly mediocre though and we&rsquo;ll discuss why shortly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The box is nice, if a tad uninteresting. Using the animation designs in the corner and animation in the background of the set shows that there is a show linked with this Theme, and the Cartoon Network logo on the back shows where you can watch this. The set is shown nicely enough, but it feels a tad limited. Still an overall decent packaging design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual for this set is rather thick, making it unfortunate that it is folded in half when packaged in the box. It will be a tad tricky, but you can get through the build instructions with a bit of patience and a hardcover book thick enough to flatten the folded manual.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There aren&rsquo;t a whole lot of parts in such a small set, but we do have some printed radar dish pieces, two in orange meant to resemble a Basketball and two smaller in white with red stripes to look like a baseball. Overall the parts selection in this set is rather mediocre, but if you enjoy cheap parts packs the set is on clearance most places.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Dino Dude: This brick built character is found in the Unikingdom Creative Box, the build for him is pretty much identical as well with a printed brick with eyes on one side for the face. It&rsquo;s a bit top heavy, but Dino Dude is great fun.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kick Flip: This character uses four parts, three 1x3 elements (one printed brick with his/her face) and a small 1x1 sloped element. Riding on a Skateboard they have something you can do with them, but in all honesty it is a bit of an odd inclusion if you&rsquo;ve never watched the show and know very little about this character.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Prince Puppycorn: Built with similar parts to Unikitty, Puppycorn looks great. Two sloped ear parts top off an over great character build that looks like a unicorn dog. The only printed element is the face.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Puppycorn&rsquo;s Trike is a quick and interesting build, the rear uses normal tires while the front has a massive tire built out of dishes and round plates. There&rsquo;s nothing much to say, it&rsquo;s using the same method of having Puppycorn ride it when you build it with the Ball Socket Brick element. I enjoyed building it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The model is quite robust, and as I mentioned the front end looks very large. Like it can roll over anything. Puppycorn controls it with a bone shaped control stick and has two stud shooters. A basket with some treats and a basketball element included, which I haven&rsquo;t seen in a long while. Overall the model is fun and you do get a few characters to build on top of it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This was a decent set, but rather unnecessary if you pick up the Creative Kingdom box since, aside from the bike model, everything in here is included there. I would only recommend this set if you are interested in buying the entire Unikitty Theme. On the other hand, with it being on clearance at most retailers this definitely makes for a great parts pack and I&rsquo;d recommend picking up a few if you&rsquo;re looking for some nice pieces for your own builds.</p>
