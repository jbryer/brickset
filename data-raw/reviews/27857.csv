The Cloud Cuckoo Land ruler has become a Princess with her broth Prince Puppycorn she gets into a lot of mischief and adventures. I purchased this set first because of Hawkodile, I just like the look of the character build and though I haven&rsquo;t seen any of the episodes yet I can safely say this set is pretty amusing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: The Unikitty box design is similar to Angry Birds. Not exactly the same, but it does feature the characters and set images on a white background. The Cartoon Network logo is found on the back too showing where to catch new episodes of your favorite LEGO television show. Overall I like the box design, it works to grab your attention and shows a lot of creativity with the images chosen to show off the set on the front and back.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: The Unikitty Theme shares similar design cues with Angry Birds in that the manuals are on a white background for the cover while showcasing the set and then we find a lot of steps for a 25$ set. The manual is actually pretty thick, there are no cross-promotions in the manual, the only non-instruction page is a shot showcasing the LEGO Life App.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Unikitty Theme introduces us to a fair number of familiar colours as seen in LEGO Friends and other similar themes, moreso than LEGO City or any other Theme has adopted. This set unfortunately doesn&rsquo;t feature a whole lot of parts, but it does have a whole lot of prints, two gold records, Master Frown&rsquo;s face, Unikitty and Puppycorn&rsquo;s facial bricks and Hawkodile gets two arm printed 1x3 tiles.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Character Builds</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Hawkodile: This is a pretty interesting character build, it&rsquo;s a large character and so uses the most parts of the character builds found in this set. He uses big fig hands and a unique part for his face as well as two wing elements which at first I thought were used in Angry Birds, however I am not 100% sure on that. His two arms can move up and down a full 180 and the tail can flip up and down. You can also pose the wings on their clips, but they don&rsquo;t look too different.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Master Frown: This character is all hard angles with sloped elements capturing the likeness of him from the show. There is a printed round tile with his frowning face and his arms are capable of moving up and down.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Puppycorn: Sharing a large percentage of his build with the standard Unikitty design and parts use, Puppycorn has a different tail element and two tooth elements used for his ears. LEGO introduced a brand new element to take advantage of the circular element with post on it first used for Dalek eyestalks. It is a reverse 1x3 plate with a hole in the bottom to accommodate the small post.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Unikitty: Welcome the newest variant of Unikitty and the first I&rsquo;ve picked up in a set with her new head attachment method, this new method of construction makes the head more stable when attached. It is still easily removed during rough play, but the head will not fall off just by moving the character quickly around.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">All of these character builds are fairly impressive and not terribly involved, easy to build and quite fun to play with for fans of the show. The printed elements also improve the detailing and offer more Unikitty variants for fans of the character to collect.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 1: Master Frown, Unikitty, Hawkodile the two presents and cake model are built in this bag, so a lot of small parts are in the bag compared to the larger models in other sets. All of the builds are pretty easy to follow along with and there are no tricky steps.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 2: Puppycorn and his DJ table with dance floor are built with the parts found in this bag. Much like bag 1 there isn&rsquo;t any tricky or difficult steps while building here. Two stickers are used for the sign on the flag pole banner. It&rsquo;s a relatively quick build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Everything in this set is pretty fun, the large cake sitting on a rolling base, the DJ stand attached to the dance floor and the few presents built as gifts for the two royals. Honestly there are not a lot of words to be said about this set&rsquo;s models, they are clever, fun, great for playing and acting out awesome parties with the character builds and work well with the characters, save for one aspect. Puppycorn can sit behind the DJ table using a Technic Joint connector brick, which isn&rsquo;t as secure as it could be, picking up the whole party table with dance floor while Puppycorn is sitting behind it will slide easily off and crash on the floor.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a pretty decent set, the models and character builds are very impressive and fun to play with. It&rsquo;s also a great set for fans of Unikitty. I would suggest if you&rsquo;re interested in this theme this set is a pretty good one to get. It&rsquo;s the only set featuring Hawkodile and the price is very reasonable. Strongly recommended.</p>

<p>Ok building experience and value for its price to part ratio. 214 pieces for $20 is pretty good.&nbsp;Meh playability as it&#39;s just a small DJ stand&nbsp;with not much play features. Good&nbsp;parts however come in this set such as the ones that make up characters such as Hawkodile. Not to mention, you get the great balloon pieces.</p>
