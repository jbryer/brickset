<p>These were better on clearance as the price was not worth it at $4, which was the same cost as a minifigure.&nbsp;Parts were good as you get many costumes for Puppycorn and Unikitty. The playability is ok with the variety you get of characters. The building experience however got stale after a while of getting the same characters over and over again. It took around 4 batches to get Party Glasses Unikitty.</p>
