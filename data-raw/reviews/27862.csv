As an afol who used to play Minecraft over a long period of time, I like this set a lot. One reason for this is that it includes the first basic steps, a player would do in a newly generated map. Furthermore, there are only a few player generated structures which are also very basic. Usually, player generated structures are the biggest reason for me not to buy a Minecraft set.</p>

<p>Due to the modular design of the skeleton attack, this set can be combined very well with other LEGO Minecraft sets. There are far more possibilities to assemble the different modules than you might expect! While this allows a good adaption to the border of other sets, the overall appearance stays quite similar. A downside of the modular structure are the compromises which had to be made to achieve it. Further information can be found below.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong><br />
The building is quite simple, since this set is designed for the age of 8+. Still, it was at no point frustrating or boring.</p>

<p>On the positive side, all of the modules are very robust. Since it took me a while to find my favorite arrangement of these modules, this is one of the main requirements.</p>

<p>I have some concerns about the building experience:<br />
One is the amount of equally shaped plates which are stacked. They make any disassembly annoying.<br />
Also, at some point, the choice of parts is weird. While I understand that the designers have to focus on cost, I think they went too far at some points.</p>

<p>In my opinion, a different color should have been used instead of brick yellow for the floor of the barn (--&gt; dark green or medium nougat), the floor of the lower tree house module (--&gt; dark green) as well as the floor of the upper tree house module (--&gt; medium nougat).<br />
Splitting the colors in two medium nougat and one dark green would have improved the overall appearance, while switching the plates of the modules is relatively easy.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong><br />
Most of the used parts are quite basic. However, a few gems are included in this set:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the red sheep head</li>
	<li>sign with arrow</li>
	<li>enchanted bow</li>
	<li>a wooden pickaxe (the most important tool when starting on a new map)</li>
</ul>

<p>also nice are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>the pumpkin</li>
	<li>fully grown wheat</li>
	<li>3 skeletons</li>
	<li>Steve (we all love Steve!)</li>
	<li>scissors (+1 extra)</li>
	<li>iron ore</li>
	<li>crafting table</li>
	<li>furnace</li>
</ul>

<p>My only complaint about the quality of the parts is the bad printing of the sheep&#39;s face. It doesn&#39;t look as white as it appears on the picture. Personally, I would have preferred a white sheep (all beds were red, back when I used to play Minecraft).</p>

<p>Furthermore, the following parts would have been awesome to round up this set:</p>

<ul>
	<li>seeds and green wheat for better farming playability (also: where is the hoe??)</li>
	<li>at least one bone (there are 3 skeletons and none dropped a bone?!)</li>
	<li>an iron ingot for improved crafting playability.</li>
	<li>maybe some food for Steve?</li>
</ul>

<p>However, Most of these are included in the chicken farm. Therefore this set would be a very good addition.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong><br />
While I don&#39;t really play with my Minecraft sets, I love it when a set tells a nice and <u>complete</u> story. This is the case for the skeleton attack.</p>

<p>The player spawns, &quot;knocks on wood&quot;, builds a crafting table, crafts a wooden pickaxe. After that he gets some stone tools/weapons and builds basic wooden items (ladder, fence, fence gate, chest...). He then finds iron ore, crafts a furnace, melts the ore and crafts scissors to shave a sheep. The wool is then used to craft a bed. Before doing that, the red flower is used to dye the sheep red in order to get a red bed.</p>

<p>Since I stopped playing Minecraft before horses were implemented, I cannot relate to the skeleton horseman. Therefore, I don&#39;t use it for display.</p>

<p><strong>Value for money</strong><br />
Well, I bought this set. This means that I found enough reasons to spend c$50 on it. It combines my &quot;the which hut&quot; and &quot;the zombie cave&quot; very well, providing many items which are required in the early game.</p>

<p>I would recommend this set as a first Minecraft set, as well as for combining sets with different biomes (there&#39;s a transit in grass color).</p>

<p>The build: Pretty good, though not very exciting.</p>

<p>The parts: Excellent! There a couple different exclusive (or near-exclusive) brown pieces. A</p>

<p>printed skeleton horse head would of been nice, as none of it&#39;s parts are exclusive.</p>

<p>The minifigures: Outstanding! The Steve is, of course, getting kind of old, but the Red Sheep</p>

<p>and the Skeleton Horseman are exclusive (all the parts of the Skeleton Horseman will be</p>

<p>available in other sets when The End Battle set comes out, as it includes an enchanted bow).</p>

<p>The structure: Including some excellent functions, the moated treehouse&nbsp;is one of the best</p>

<p>Minecraft&nbsp;player-built structures, featuring a trapdoored&nbsp;lookout post, a bedroom, a fenced</p>

<p>tower for the red sheep (which strangely is made so the sheep could walk into Steve&#39;s bedroom</p>

<p>at any time), a sort of drawbridge which can be turned so that the skeletons either fall into the</p>

<p>water or simply cannot get to the island, a well, a small rocky formation that the skeletons seem</p>

<p>strangely attached to,&nbsp;a small crafting/kitchen area, and a small lawn in front of the treehouse.</p>

<p>The functions: A nice little trapdoor, which could actually be kind of fun for Steve, as the</p>

<p>trapdoor is positioned right over Steve&#39;s bed, and in the game, if you fall on a bed, you</p>

<p>bounce.</p>

<p>Overall thoughts: This is a great set, though a wolf would of fitted in nicely, as wolves attack</p>

<p>skeletons, and Steve&#39;s outnumbered 3 to 1, not counting animals. This set works wonderfully</p>

<p>with The Chicken Coop, as Steve would have Alex and a needed&nbsp;Wolf to help him fight. I&#39;m</p>

<p>not sure what the fire&#39;s for, (maybe to represent a lightning strike?) and to make this set twice</p>

<p>as amazing, Lego could have put in a golem function, turning a lightning-struck horse into a</p>

<p>Skeleton Horseman. The accessories are okay, including two bows, an enchanted bow,</p>

<p>shears, a wooden pickaxe, a stone axe, and a stone sword. Other pros about combining this</p>

<p>set with The Chicken Coop are better farming playability and more food for Steve. Here are</p>

<p>the overall pros and cons:</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Skeleton Horseman</p>

<p>Red Sheep</p>

<p>Sign</p>

<p>Trapdoor</p>

<p>Great structure</p>

<p>Drawbridge</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>No wolf</p>

<p><em>Another&nbsp;</em>Steve</p>

<p>Overall rating: 5 out of 5!</p>
