He was the first one I ordered and I was very ecstatic to get him in the mail since he&#39;s one of my favorites from the series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It didn&#39;t take long to build him, but the pieces can easily get lost. He&#39;s a one-sided&nbsp;head mini-fig, with his little quiver on his back and the shurikens&nbsp;and bow at the ready. The pegs for Zane to stand on in the pod hold him in place, and he&#39;d only come loose if I accidentally drop the pod for some reason.</p>

<p>I only have two real issues with this pod:&nbsp;<br />
One is the fact that it&#39;s white. Duh, what else would you expect, he&#39;s the White Ninja, but I like keeping my Legos and my Mini-Figures clean. I can&#39;t just wash the pod with detergent or in the dishwasher on sanitize&nbsp;like I normally do every few months (a lot of colds come through my house) because the background sticker can get ruined, and that&#39;s something I&#39;d like to avoid.</p>

<p>My only other issue is the fact that the training helmet on the mannequin&nbsp;won&#39;t stay on. It comes loose if you bounce it around in your bag enough. The same goes for the other pods, but I guess the fact that the mannequin takes up the majority of the space and it won&#39;t fall off the head makes up for it.</p>
