I don&#39;t live near a LEGO store, so I always have to pick up sets&nbsp;that are supposed to be LEGO store exclusives when I see them in my local shops.</p>

<p>The set itself is simple, but cute.The ears are posable, it has a cute little tail, a nice button nose, and a nice use of pieces ot create the buck teeth. The build for the tort to get the white belly was simple, but affective. The only prints in this set are the eyes and the 2x4 tile stating that this is a seasonal set. All the other details are brick-built. The one thing that I don&#39;t like it that the pink on the ears shows on both sides. I don&#39;t know how this could have been fixed, but it does annoy me a bit. The side-builds are nie, and i like that this brickheadz is still $10 even though it has this extra stuff. Each side includes a build for an egg and a flower. The rabbit itself has a carrot and a basket as accessories.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a really nice seasonal set and it really gets me into the spring and Easter mood. I would recommend this to anyone who would like a cute little spring set to put on display.</p>
