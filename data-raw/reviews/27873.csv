"1947andallthat","2018-11-03T13:05:10.317Z","Not the best, but not bad","<p>Halloween; one of my least favourite times of year, but there&#39;s always seasonal LEGO sets to look forward to. It was always going to be hard to live up to the standards set last year by Halloween Haunt, but I thought that this set could do a decent job. So does buying it actually prove to be trick or treat?</p>

<p><strong>Box &amp; Instructions</strong></p>

<p>Nothing to say here, really. Standard BrickHeadz box (other than the size; the Seasonal ones are always bigger), some unnumbered bags of pieces and a 48-page booklet.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Unlike some recent BrickHeadz&nbsp;(my main example is Boba Fett; look out for my review of him soon), this one shows very few imaginative building techniques. Beyond sticking plates onto side studs, there&#39;s nothing to do here.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This is one of the model&#39;s key redeeming points. The use of some quite rare colours to represent the witch&#39;s distinctive appearance has given this set a number of pretty desirable recolours. We have two olive green 1x1 plates, which have only been seen in eleven other places (not that rare, I know, but a nice and not particularly common colour), and two 1x1 bricks with side stud in medium lavender for just the eighth time. The plethora of purple parts (say that three times really fast) also gives us three 4x4 plates, found in nine other sets, and a 2x2x2/3 brick with bow, found in eleven other sets. Finally, we have 2 small lavender tree limbs, in seven other sets, and a pair of 1x2 plates with a horizontal clip for only the third time in green.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>Like all BrickHeadz&nbsp;so far, the witch stands on a simple black base, with a printed 2x4 tile showing that she is a Seasonal set. Another feature of the Seasonal figures, a small set of backdrops, is also found here; on her left, a pumpkin (sadly not printed) stands in the shadow of a black tree with nice lavender leaves, while a cauldron rests atop a... is that some kind of magic pillar of fire? Anyway, a cauldron with a bone inside stands on something to her right.</p>

<p>The figure itself stands on extra-large feet, presumably an attempt to replicate pointy, witchy shoes, and not an entirely successful one. However, her torso looks nicer, with a gold belt buckle and a large black bow above. On her arms, one of which holds a broom, you can see&nbsp;the ends of a prominent black collar, which works much better in person than I thought it would. This extends around her back into a nice cape. Her head, decorated on all sides with parts of her short black hair, looks pretty good, with a prominent pointy nose, one of only two human (if she is human) noses on a BrickHeadz&nbsp;(or BrickHead?) to date. Her eyes stand on olive green plates in contrast to the normal green of the rest of her face, which I assume are meant to represent sunken eye sockets, and, in person, they don&#39;t do a bad job. I&#39;m less convinced by her hat, as I think it looks quite odd without a large brim, but the peak looks nice to me, representing a pointy, wizard-y hat quite well.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>I am satisfied with this, but not blown away. There are a number of nice touches, and the whole thing holds water overall, but nothing&#39;s really proved to be that exciting. It&#39;s not bad, but doesn&#39;t stand out.</p>

<p>In short, buy it if you, like me, want more Seasonal sets, or if you need a big BrickHeadz&nbsp;collection, but, for most people, this can be skipped over pretty quickly.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-11-07T12:15:08.143Z","Haunting Mystic","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #40272 Witch:</b> LEGO&rsquo;s Seasonal sets for the past two years have been BrickHeadz related, and apparently they haven&rsquo;t sold nearly as well as you&rsquo;d think since they are still in stock. This is a shame, if nothing else the sets do include a lot of useful parts and make for decent parts packs. Still I can understand why not everybody would want to pick these up.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The boxes are quite a bit longer than traditional BrickHeadz packages. There are no images on the side either showing a depiction of the character, as this character is unique. A few pumpkin faces are visible faintly in the background and the Witch is shown prominently with some additional scenery, but her stand is not present. Seasonal 31 is shown in the lower corner.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manuals are the same as every other BrickHeadz, easy to follow, hard to keep open to the appropriate page thanks to the folded nature of the manuals in the box. An image in the back shows that the next set in the series was the Turkey.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with most BrickHeadz this set is a perfect parts pack. More-so than most because you&rsquo;ll find a lot of bricks and plates in purple and green colours, the only printed element is the 1x1 tile for the eyes and the 2x4 tile which shows the BrickHeadz symbol and the Seasonal word balloon. Everything else is not printed.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Building this BrickHeadz was pretty interesting. While it uses the same basic skeleton, there are some instances of a more unique look, this is one of the few BrickHeadz to feature a nose, so the face is built much differently compared to the smooth heads/front panels of other BrickHeadz. The traditional hat on her head was also very enjoyable to build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This type of BrickHeadz sits on a larger stand compared to others, this is because the Seasonal BrickHeadz features additional plates and side-sections which feature thematic accessories for each character. Our witch friend has a small tree and pumpkin on one side and a simmering cauldron on the other. It&rsquo;s a fun looking model for fans of BrickHeadz at least and it is interesting to build a BrickHead that doesn&rsquo;t feature a single printed piece for the details. (Save for the eyes of course.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It&rsquo;s hard to say if this set is worth getting. Honestly I skipped them originally not really finding them too appealing, but the longer I collect BrickHeadz and the more I see these older sets still around I find myself picking them up for something to build and add to the collection because there just are not enough BrickHeadz to find at retail these days.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This might seem like a bad idea, a very bad idea in some cases, but the BrickHeadz are so cheap and the builds and characters chosen are always so much fun I justify it as being another decent model to put on the shelf. Not everyone is going to enjoy the set the same way I do. So in the end, I guess it really sums up as this.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Recommended for fans. Skip it if you passed on it originally. If you still don&rsquo;t care much about the BrickHeadz seasonal sets just continue to ignore it. In the end it&rsquo;s all up to preferences.</p>
