<p>The construction of the Turkey is extremely simple - the most intricate being the two red elements. But in its simplicity lies its strength, IMHO. It is simply lovely, all essential elements are included.The setting of the bird in a patch with pumpkin (a minifigure&nbsp;head) and carrots, completes the scene. Somehow the bird IMHO looks a bit sad, is it knows what its Thanksgiving fate will be.</p>

<p>An excellent little set, well worth its price.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Being a turkey in the shape of a man, which is shaped like a brickhead, amazingly it&#39;s quite cohesive.</span></span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">BUILD</span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">When built, there is a stand and the actual man-turkey figure.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The stand is a small chunk of a farm or festival ground, containing many little plants. These include carrots and a pumpkin, making effective use of a few parts to set a wider scene. In the middle is a black plate stand, with a print denoting this as a &ldquo;seasonal&rdquo; collectible. The figure attaches via 2 studs, but can also stand by itself without falling.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Man-turkey is assembled simply and vertically for the most part, with the center column being a 4x4 with various things attached via the 1x2x2 sideways bricks. The &ldquo;torso&rdquo; of the turkey is sat on top of chunky legs, which use the 3x3 cross plates as the claws for the feet.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">At the rear is a hinge which holds the tail-fan assembly, with &ldquo;wings&rdquo; that are attached sideways and are given clips to hold items (even though its a turkey with no fingers, but whatever). The wattle is made of staggered red curves which give very effective colour contrast, with the beak in bright orange completing the turkey look.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The head is made up of 3 sides which are rounded, with the &ldquo;face&rdquo; being smooth and flat, with the crown being open studs with some cheeseslopes to show the saggy skin of a turkey.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The result is a build with a small range of SNOT to attach surfaces sideways, each of which being done in such that it is very solid.</span></span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">CRITICISMS</span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">For what this is, it works completely and effectively, with no element that is fragile or out of place.</span></span></p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">SUMMARY</span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">This thing is some kind of weird abomination, being a turkey in the shape of a man in the shape of some cubes, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s great. The design is somewhat endearing, with it being like a physical caricature, which helps to form it into a final product. Its semi-simple&nbsp; build works for something like this that is competing with things such as Funko-pop things, being straightforward enough for figure collectors, with enough going on to allow for a short and lightly varied building experience. The oddness is what was attractive as a set to get, man-turkey feeling like some kind of horror character from the pits of the internet.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Its a good model, an okay lego set.</span></span></p>
