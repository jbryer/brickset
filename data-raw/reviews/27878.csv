<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>-The photographer is a great&nbsp;minifigure, the new face print is nice, as well as the torso. the hair is&nbsp;okay. The camera is a nice accessory. The satchel is cool too.</p>

<p>-The hiker is awesome! His torso print is super cool, as well as his face print. the lime hiking sticks are cool too.</p>

<p>-The dude with the baby carrier looks great, and the new baby carrier works well. The only problem with it is it blocks the torso print!</p>

<p>-The kid with the backpack is decent, his head print is okay. The stove and plate are also okay. The egg is nice though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The mountain biker is really great, the bike is great but maybe a black or red bike would be better.</p>

<p>-The chap with the selfie stick is great, with the new shirt print and face print. A new phone print would be nice, this one does not look like a smartphone.</p>

<p>-The woman with&nbsp;the pink shirt looks okay, not super exciting. The hair is nice, and the torso.</p>

<p>-The kid with the striped shirt is boring, all the pieces are reused. The water bottle is good.</p>

<p>-The woman with the phone is nice, the hair and torso are good. (I think this phone would look good in white or black for the selfie stick.</p>

<p>-The kid in the jacket is okay.</p>

<p>-The woman with the gray hair is cool, the torso print is well done. The lantern is nice.</p>

<p>-The climber is an epic guy with a cool tank top and legs. The head is not super interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The boat guy in the gray jacket is decent with lots of reused parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The boat guy in the brown jacket is awesome, with a great face print and torso. For both&nbsp;boat people, the life jackets are good as well as the helmets.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Accessories&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The boat and oars are good, and it&nbsp;floats.</p>

<p>-The log ramp for the bike is good.</p>

<p>-The bald eagle is amazing, with a&nbsp;dual-molded body and printed beak and eyes. The only thing wrong with it is the talons are brown and look like feet. They are oversized to carry a fish.</p>

<p>-The signpost is okay.</p>

<p>-The rock face is a BURP with grips. :( Nothing interesting.</p>

<p>-The tent is good and has nice printing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-All that&#39;s left is a fish.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall, a good set, but a lower price would be better.</h3>

I found it helpful to have the minifig page for this set from brickset itself open when&nbsp;putting them together.&nbsp; My only real complaint about them is that i don&#39;t really think the &quot;water bottles&quot; work.&nbsp; This set also come with some mini-builds, all of which are nice.&nbsp; However the log jump was a bit of a pain to put together.&nbsp; For instance even though the instructions show it, the log just doesn&#39;t want to attache&nbsp;to it&#39;s piece while both are siting on the plate.&nbsp; But all in all it&#39;s a very nice set.</p>
