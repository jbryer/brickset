Here&rsquo;s one of the 25$ price range from 2018. I seem to always get last year&rsquo;s sets at the end of the current year, meaning I&rsquo;m a bit behind on my collecting and reviewing. Anyway, let&rsquo;s discuss one of the sets which features prominently in the Batman Family Matters special.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: This is the typical DC Super Hero box design, the blue has grown darker as the years progressed, but it&rsquo;s mostly been the same. The action shot on the front of the box is great fun and the images on the back of the box showing off what you get in the set and what the storyline might be is very impressive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: A single booklet for such a small set showing each step-by-step build, you find everything easy to follow along with and even the placement of stickers isn&rsquo;t a huge issue with this particular set. Speaking of which, the sticker sheet is small and easily lost, so be aware of it when opening the set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Aside from all the elements in the model this set includes a set of gold looking Bat accessories, large batarangs, bat symbol shields and weapons&hellip; honestly I have no clue what they are meant to be officially, but they look clever. The remote control Batarangs are even used cleverly in the model build itself.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ace the Bat Hound: Ace features prominently in the film, and here in this set you&rsquo;ll find a character build similar in design to how Scooby is built. Ace has a unique head element, I feel his lower torso may have been used before, it has a paw raised that can grip clips to hold LEGO accessories. He also has a short black cape.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Batman: In contrast to his canine companion, this Batman doesn&rsquo;t have a single cape. Instead he&rsquo;s wearing the bulky armour first introduced in the Batman V. Superman sets, regular batarangs clip to his back. His cowl is a matching metallic silver black look. The printing on Batman is superb, he is loaded with armour detailing on his legs and torso, and his head features a special mask element with visor that is printed as cracked open after battling his enemies revealing his regular face underneath.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Talon Assassin: Both of these Minifigures are the exact same, dressed in a ninja looking costume with a funky mask design on the head, the differences is mostly in their accessories. One Talon possesses a pair of katana and back-sheath for holding them, while the other is using gold &lsquo;Wolverine&rsquo; claws. A nice pair of villains for Batman to fight.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Ace and Batman begin to construct their trusty vehicle with bag number one. This entire section of the build does not rely on any sticker placement. So you shouldn&rsquo;t have any difficulties with building it. It&rsquo;s a rather chunky looking build to as you work in all the interesting details, the engine design is particularly interesting.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: The Talons leap out to aid in adding the final touches to the vehicle. Here you will find all of the sticker placement, the headlights, the taillight and the 1x2 control panel. The wheels are a bit ungainly as you work to build them onto the model, but should pose too much of a problem.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">All-Terrain-Bat-Trike: Obviously that isn&rsquo;t what this model is actually called, I have no idea what the official name of this model is, but it&rsquo;s big bulky wheels roll over Minifigures easily. And it does seem to resemble a tricycle, loaded with personality. There&rsquo;s a menacing pair of red eyes on a sticker in front, two stud-shooters, some clips to store the gold Batarangs that Ace can hold, some large exhaust pipes and a creepy rear grille. The sticker looks more like a weird Joker smile on Batman&rsquo;s vehicle, but that&rsquo;s just his taillight, really similar to an odd Joker smile though.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Overall this model is sweet and a nice new vehicle to add to the Bat-Pool. A shame the Talons don&rsquo;t have anything to counteract it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This was a fun set overall to build and features some unique villains we haven&rsquo;t seen in previous sets. It&rsquo;s also great to get Ace the Bat Hound. I&rsquo;d recommend trying to get this set as retailers clearance out the 2018 products leaving you only to rely on the secondary market if you miss this final opportunity to pick this set up. Recommended.</p>
