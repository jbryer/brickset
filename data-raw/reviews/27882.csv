"alfred_the_buttler","2018-10-01T04:47:26.907Z","Great set, but for older kids","<p>So my son got this set for his 5th birthday and loves it. However, it is not something that he can build himself. While the suggested age is 6 years old, it would be incredibly difficult for a 6 year old to assemble on their own. The Batplane&nbsp;is pretty complex, and it takes a lot of strength and accuracy to insert the antennas into the headlight bricks for Brother Eye. In fact the later isn&rsquo;t even easy for an adult. I would think that perhaps this set should be for an 8 or 9 year old, and they would still need an adult to help with the antennas.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the set, it is very cool. Brother Eye contains a light brick, and that alone makes it fun. However, the light reveals circuits that lie underneath his pupil which is pretty awesome. Of course all the arms are completely flexible which means that he offers a lot of playability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Batplane&nbsp;however, while it looks impressive and appears like it should move, is completely rigid. It would have been nice if you could move the wings up and down or in and out. Of course the biggest issue is the cockpit, not only does it only hold a single minifigure, meaning either Batman or Batgirl&nbsp;is left stranded, but the minifigure needs to be lying down or the cockpit won&rsquo;t close. This makes absolutely no sense, and is not at all logical to a little kid or even a parent. My wife got frustrated that she couldn&rsquo;t help my son close the cockpit, and I only discovered that the minifigure needs to be lying down by closely examining the picture on the box.</p>

<p>the main positive of this set is in the bricks included. You get a large collection of special Batman bricks, only 3 of which are used, and the rest become accessories. Omac&nbsp;has very cool shooter accessories that can go very far and are very easy to use by a small child. Then there is of course the light up brick along with a bunch of specialized bricks used in the Batplane.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My son does love this set, but I simply can&rsquo;t rank it highly because of its difficulty to build (for the suggested age range) and the horribly small and hard to use cockpit. It was a gift so I can&rsquo;t complain about the price, but while there are some cool bricks, the shortcomings of the Batplane&nbsp;simply doesn&rsquo;t justify the msrp.&nbsp;</p>

"KoolKreeper489","2019-01-06T01:24:15.01Z","Batman: Brother Eye Takedown Review","<p>The Batman: Brother Eye Takedown set is a nice small set from the DC Superheroes theme. It includes The Batwing, The Brother Eye, and 3 minifigures. It was released in 2018 for $29.99 and has 269 pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><strong>Batman- </strong>This is a standard version of Batman with nice printing. 9/10</p>

<p><strong>Batwoman-</strong> This is a new minifigure that has never been made before. The printing is great and has a nice new cowl/hair piece combo. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>OMAC-</strong> I don&#39;t know anything about this character but still has nice standard printing and a cool blue Mohawk. 8/10</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The Batwing build isn&#39;t that big but is still a nice build. The Brother Eye is a weird build but has a nice printed piece for the eye and there is a light brick behind the eye. I enjoyed building The Batwing but I don&#39;t like The Brother Eye. I like how this set doesn&#39;t&nbsp;have any stickers. 8/10</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>I like this set and is a good set for $29.99. It has good minifigures with Batwoman being one of my favorites but I don&#39;t know who the villain is in this set. I have never heard of OMAC or The Brother Eye but still ok for this set. The Batwing is a great build for the size and the Brother Eye is just a weird build. Overall this is an average DC Superheroes set.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-13T17:54:54.843Z","Batwoman Is Here!","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #76111 Batman: Brother Eye Takedown:</b> The LEGO company has light-up bricks, but they are rarely available in sets, at least outside of certain specialty sets. This is the first time I&rsquo;ve experienced this element and it is rather impressive for what it is. This set features another Batjet, which doesn&rsquo;t use the light brick, but is still an impressive model. This set was featured prominently in the recently released Making Family Blu-Ray from LEGO DC and it&rsquo;s a great set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The box for this set features a dynamic shot of the set on the front and some play features on the back which are included in the set. It showcases everything quite effectively had has the Light Brick logo prominently on the front. The Box design hasn&rsquo;t changed a great deal since 2012, up to 2018 they were all pretty much shades of blue in a similar fashion. That changes with 2019, but we&rsquo;ll discuss that in a 2019 LEGO DC set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is also well designed without too many irritating steps or difficult to follow along with. LEGO seems to have changed the manuals slightly, they no longer show-off other sets in the wave in large images in the back. You may see these images still, or you may just see the parts list and maybe an ad for LEGO LIFE. But the manuals are still easy to follow along with and include all of the build steps fairly simply. Only a few I&rsquo;ve built recently include some very odd developments, but we&rsquo;ll discuss that in a set review where that happens.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set features a nice printed large dish with an eye on it for Brother Eye, includes a set of the Bat themed accessories and elements which are used for detailing and includes the typical bat elements of black, silver and really dark grey, yellow and of course lighter grey. The light up brick is also in this set, which is a great looking element.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Batman: Dressed in the grey armour as opposed to his black suit, Batman is using the Knightmare Batman head here, with the stubble on his face beneath the cowl. I have no idea why, but it is an interesting combination of previous parts on a Batman figure. He has the soft-goods black cape and a Batarang. He also gets a new accessory from the Bat themed parts packs, this resembles a remote control for the Remote Control Batarang, a small bat-shaped control device with sculpted buttons and possibly a display. Overall not much to say here. I&rsquo;ve got so many Batmen now in my collection I could have a Crisis on Infinity Earths LEGO display.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Batwoman: Brand new for 2018, Batwoman joins the rank of Batfamily characters in Minifigure form. She has a very impressive black and red Batsuit with red Batsymbol on her chest, the torso printing is dual-sided and highly detailed with her musculature and utility belt. Her red cape is a soft-goods cape and the first time this particular element has been offered in red I think. She features a brand new sculpted cowl with red hair included as part of the sculpt, which looks pretty solid and is a dual-molded element I believe. Her head is white with two different expressions, a regular smiling one and a angry scowl. Officially she has no accessories while piloting her Batwing, but you can give her the Batarang element from the Bat Elements Pack if you so desired.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Omac: This Minifigure would make a perfect army pack character to include, considering the recent Blu-Ray release showed multiples of them under the control of Brother Eye it makes sense. The detailing on him is mono-eye on the face and mono-eye on the chest, a stylized eye jewel or clasp or camera built into his musculature on the front. He has a blue Mohawk and the older pressure fired energy blasts for his accessories.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Batman builds Brother Eye and this build is extremely involved for something as ordinary looking as a space satellite with a giant eye on the front. There were no issues I found while building this, but I was surprised that LEGO did not include some kind of stand for Brother Eye to rest on once built. Considering the awkward nature of the model, it is unfortunate. Still though the build was actually rather fun, I enjoyed integrating the light brick with the model, placing some of the antenna was a bit irritating, but once I got them oriented correctly it worked out fine.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Batwoman gets started on her Batwing by building the Chassis/Fuselage. This was a quick section of the build, it was finished roughly in a half hour. No stickers here and nothing was problematic.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: Omac adds the wings, cockpit and bat accessories to the Batwing. This build was equally as fast as the previous build. Not much to say here, it is nice to see a model that doesn&rsquo;t rely on stickers in this Theme for detailing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Batjet: A solid little model with stud shooters and room to accommodate a single pilot. It&rsquo;s a smaller version of the Batwing as seen in the 1989 Tim Burton Batman film. A design which is often associated with that film, but probably appeared in the comics many years previously. It has no moveable parts either, the wings are a solid build attached to the fuselage. It&rsquo;s a great model for play or display.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Brother Eye: This model is irritating, it looks great, it&rsquo;s got a truly menacing vice with the large single eye on the front of the satellite body, and it has three &lsquo;arms&rsquo; that can move independently from one another and a stud shooter is included, but it is a horrible model to place anywhere on your DC Super Heroes shelf. Now don&rsquo;t get me wrong, KFOLS will play with the model, they&rsquo;ll press the light brick to menace Batman, and they&rsquo;ll probably have loads of fun. But quite frankly as a displayable model to sit amongst the DC Super Heroes and Villains this model just fails. It cannot stand up well without moving two of the arms to help stabilize it, it isn&rsquo;t very stable though and can be knocked over very easily. It is a fun toy, but it is not a very good display piece.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set features a lot of new characters for DC Comics, Brother Eye, Omac and Batwoman. This makes this a very collectible set and one I strongly recommend. Despite my issues with Brother Eye not including any type of display stand for a proper look, the entire package offsets this minor personal gripe. Fully Recommended.</p>

"Puidwen","2019-08-30T20:57:36.95Z","A very enjoyable set.","<p>I got lucky pick this set up for $5 at a Wal-Mart.&nbsp; First up is the brother eye satellite, which is mainly the reason i want the set in the first place.&nbsp; The build can be a tad difficult in places but still not bad.&nbsp; He&#39;s built in a sort of &quot;layered cake style&quot;.&nbsp; Occasionally this means i had to move parts, or just use a bit more force then usual to get bricks to snap together.&nbsp; There&#39;s a very awesome circuit print on the eye part, which works really well with the light brick. While you can see inside the claws, for the most part even this works.&nbsp; The claws are&nbsp;very posable.&nbsp; The batplane is very nice too.&nbsp; To me it gives a sort of Batman: TAS style vibe.&nbsp; It also an easy build, although i did fine myself messing up the rear once of twice.&nbsp; Looking at it just now i see that the rubber nose pieces are starting to bend and i haven&#39;t had it very long, so that might be something to look out for.&nbsp; The minifigures&nbsp;are very nice.&nbsp; Batman and Batwoman have two face prints, and very nice chest prints.&nbsp; Although i do think both of batwoman&#39;s mouths might be too high.&nbsp; When you put her cowl on it obscures the upper part of both mouths.</p>
