"RykerGig","2018-07-03T03:13:15.157Z","Finally!","<p>It&#39;s quite easy to say that Lego tends to slack when it comes to hospitals, so this is a pleasant surprise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With that said, this hospital is a hit among the Lego community. With three floors, a helicopter, and ambulance, it gives you all you need in the typical hospital scene. The modern-style exterior is flashy and has excellent detailing, while the inside is playable and covers a wide range of medical departments. The minifigure count is high- 11 or 10.5 (the baby), and more than enough. I really enjoyed the new and updated medical personnel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing that really caught my eye with this set- it has similar dimensions to the 4429 helicopter rescue set. This means that if you have the 4429 set, you can attach it to the side of the hospital via the ambulance bay. This creates a large and very impressive hospital complex.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&#39;s all!</p>

"Your_Future_President","2018-12-27T18:52:00.177Z","Worth it","<p>The many minifigures are included in this set.&nbsp; Four nurses/doctors, ambulance driver, pilot, and four patients/citizens, and a baby.&nbsp; Some include double sided faces which is a plus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ambulance: This is a wonderful vehicle.&nbsp; It has room for one driver and someone lying in a stretcher in back.&nbsp; Unfortunately it does not have room for dials or other life saving equipment or even another nurse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Helicopter: Worst part of every Lego city set.&nbsp; Same cockpit, same roters, etc.&nbsp; The landing pad is not special, but is neat because most hospitals do have one either on the roof or off to the side.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building: Built in a modular style, the floors are rearrangable, which is neat.&nbsp; On the first floor, the door slides open, and there is a gift shop of sorts with pastries, water, and Lego sets.&nbsp; No money is included to pay for this though.&nbsp; There is no check-in desk, which is apart of almost every real life hospital.&nbsp; There is instead a computer check in.&nbsp; To the left is an emergency entrance, which does not have a closing door.</p>

<p>Second floor: includes an x-ray machine with a light brick.&nbsp; This function is ingenious, but because of the the type of light, it is somewhat hard to tell what the projection is showing.&nbsp; Also on this floor is an eye doctor with an eye chart that reads &quot;IF YOU CAN READ THIS YOU HAVE GOOD VISION&quot; which was comical.</p>

<p>Third floor: hospital room with various monitors and so forth, and also a table of sorts for the newly born baby to sleep in.&nbsp; This also includes a balcony, which is only two studs deep and therefore not very usable.&nbsp; An adjustable lamp hangs from the ceiling which is neat. The roof of the building is not spectacular in any way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Verdict:&nbsp; An excellent build, but seems a bit small compared to its contemporaries of the police station and fire station of one and two years prior respectively.&nbsp; I personally followed the design of the building and with my own pieces extended the bottom floor to the right a little bit to add another room, which adds substance.&nbsp; Other than that, an excellent build, but consider ordering pieces to enlarge it from bricklink or somewhere.</p>

"badriser","2019-06-16T23:46:03.037Z","SSM Hospital review","<p>My kid was missing a hospital for her city and considering I missed out on the friends set, this one was a welcome adition.</p>

<p>Just one thing missing. A surgeon or two. Would have been better than all those doctors.</p>

<p>My kid has just had surgery and spite beeing only 5, she expected to get some blue minifigs to play out her own adventure.</p>

<p>We swapped some torsos and bam... problem solved. It&#39;s so nice to play with LEGO.</p>

<p>As an AFOL... I was disappointed.</p>

<p>Not with the design of the set, which is beautiful, well done and we&#39;ll thought. Like I said, just the missing surgeons.</p>

<p>But with...</p>

<p>Missing pieces ( luckily on the roof ).&nbsp; Third time this happens this year.</p>

<p>White bricks with 3 different tones of white. Some really yellowy like if they had been left in the sun. I had this problem with the x-wing I bought this year but did not mind since it gives a beat up look to it. But the hospital has lots of white and it shows alot.</p>

<p>Did not have this problem with the new mellenium falcon and it has a lot of white.</p>

<p>The worst are the 2x2 white bricks that have different sizes depending on the tone. And I noticed it with my fingers while we were building. I felt the bricks weren&#39;t aligning properly and when I looked I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes. I felt cheated as if building a&nbsp; counterfeit.</p>

<p>Really disappointed with the quality of the sets this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>LEGO better check their quality control team because this is unforgivable. We pay good money for each set.</p>
