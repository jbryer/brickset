(Updated 200529, image links adjusted)</p>

<p>I will briefly sketch the sequence of the assembly progress. Parts are in numbered bags where you have 1 up to three bags per build sequence (&quot;step&quot;):</p>

<h3>Steps 1 .. 8: Undercarriage</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Gearbox for slewing and outriggers<br />
	Independent, forward / reverse for each function</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt=""chassis gear  box with fewer colours"" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42082/051_img_9527k.png"" /></p>

<ul>
	<li>Rear axle (marked by green 3x5L beams)<br />
	Front axle (marked by orange 3x5L beams)<br />
	This is almost identical to rear axle.</li>
	<li>Front and rear outriggers<br />
	Again almost identical. The building process is getting somewhat tedious because of repetition for front and rear.</li>
	<li>Motor and rear finish.<br />
	Also the steering knob is installed. Thus green and orange indicators have become obsolete.</li>
	<li>Front finish</li>
	<li>Turntable</li>
	<li>Finish for left and right side of chassis.<br />
	Slewing function (right) respectively outriggers (left), toolbox and ladders.<br />
	Similar for both sides.</li>
	<li>Wheel &quot;arches&quot;, front and back light and wheels hubs.<br />
	Basically four times building of each.</li>
</ul>

<p>This finishes work on chassis. The sets box is a good measure for its length:</p>

<p><img alt=""chassis compared to box"" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42082/055_img_9540k.png"" /><br />
(Height, width = ca. 60 % of box)</p>

<p>What I like: The input from wheels to the motor is geared up considerably. Friction appears to limit the speed where the truck can be moved for- or backward.<br />
Compared with other (recent) technic models the turning radius seems to be adequate.</p>

<p>I suggest not to spent too much time to set the length of small linear actuators to the printed length. Instead just mount them and then extend them until the actuator is stopped when the outrigger hits another beam.</p>

<p>Alignment of axles for steering: I advise to put on the wheels to get a better feeling of small deviations from straight alignment. However, this can be corrected until turntable is put in place (Step 6).</p>

<p>The chassis does not appear the bend as much as some reviews might indicate.</p>

<h3>Steps 9 .. 13: Superstructure</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Lower part of the crane.<br />
	The gear box in this one selects functions of crane respectively in the chassis (outriggers, slewing)<br />
	<em>Remark: the white 3L axle connector used in step 684 never gets fixed on its second end</em></li>
	<li>This will add the gear box for three functions of the crane arm (elevation, extension, winch), the motor and the battery box.<br />
	Near the end of the step the top will be fixed to the chassis.<br />
	It is then possible to operate the winch, rotate the crane and deploy the outriggers.<br />
	<br />
	<em>Remark: There has been question on the function of the white rubber bands (step 764).<br />
	The two bands on the neighbouring axles of the gear box will transmit opposite direction of rotation to their common upper point and thus stop each other because of their counterrotation. If the winch is not engaged to the motor, the &#39;rope&#39; thus cannot be pulled out. This is quite effective even under considerable load on the hook.</em><br />
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Step 11 builds the crane arm and add it to the super structure.<br />
	At the end, all motor driven functions are operational.<br />
	The boom appears less bulky as those from other cranes. This may be due to single extension and/or because of its outstanding length.</li>
	<li>Next, panels are added to cover the super structure. Although the result has good appearance I found this step not interesting at all.<br />
	Cabin is left for the last set of bags.</li>
	<li>The cabin, mirrors, support sheets for outriggers, and two tool boxes are the last pieces to be added to the crane.<br />
	The rest will build four wall panels that perhaps represent a prefabricated house:</li>
</ul>

<h3>Playability, Rating, and Comments</h3>

<p>The picture gives an impression of the size of the final model:</p>

<p><img alt=""Crane with its box for comparison"" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42082/015_img_9893k.png"" /><br />
(Rear is aligned with right side of the box, the top exceeds the flap of the box by a few centimeters.)</p>

<p>Regarding the scale the crane seems to match with 42070 truck:</p>

<p><img alt=""comparison"" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42082/053_img_9534k.png"" /></p>

<p>Unusual is the remaining elevation of the lowered boom. Also, the hook is swinging freely, there is no suggestion how to fix it to the chassis when the model is driving.<br />
Also, as there is backlash in the drivetrain of the slewing gear, the superstructure will slightly swing left-right when pushed around.</p>

<p>The three functions of the boom are well done and working fast enough for good playability. The freely moving pulleys to coil the rope are working fine.<br />
Even the outriggers extend faster than some other reviews indicate. It would have been nice if they could reach the ground on their own but the supporting panels add to the realism. Of course, they cannot lift the crane off the ground. As they are, they fit the rest of the chassis nicely both for ground clearance and towards the wheel arches.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I cannot draw a comparison with 42009 mobile crane. The latter has smaller scale; its superstructure has only about (estimated) 50-60% of the area. Thus, rough terrain crane can be much more detailed. The sheer size (and weight) are also convincing. Regarding 42070 truck the scale is beneficial.</p>

<p><img alt=""42009 (modified) and 42082"" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42082/091_img_9578k.png"" /></p>

<p>Set 855 was my fifth technic set. This crane is way ahead of it. But regard that the former was built from a large number of plain bricks and plates. It still has an appeal of its own.<br />
(For a picture of both see <a href=""https://brickset.com/article/37742/review-42082-rough-terrain-crane-part-2"">review by FlagsNZ</a>)</p>

<h3>Modifcations</h3>

<p>For better playability I have added to more levers to the gear selection box. Thus each function can be selected together with the other ones. You&#39;ll notice a (slight) slow down but now the boom can be put into operation considerable faster. Also you don&#39;t have to switch between boom extension and winch all the time.</p>

<p><img alt=""modified selector for boom functions"" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42082/511_img_9859k.png"" /></p>

<p>During build I have substituted the orange, yellow, and green parts with light grey ones. Building process was still clear but the model appeared to be less variegated.</p>

<p>I have replaced the original linear actuators for boom elevation by XL ones (introduced with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42108-1/"">42108</a>):</p>

<p>This setup will give you a &gt; 90&deg; range of elevation:</p>

"legomandre42082","2018-12-22T23:49:47.807Z","Best Lego Set of 2018!!!!!","<h2><strong>A model that ceases to disappoint:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>Late this past Summer, Lego Youtuber&nbsp;and Blogger Zusammengebaut revealed that the Lego Technic group would release its largest model to date. After seeing the sheer scale of the model and every unique function within it, I knew that I had to save and build the model&nbsp;during my Christmas break from&nbsp;College. The pictures do not do the model any justice for how grandiose it is in person and the insane amount of detail throughout. I knew, as being a Modular and Technic fan, that the Rough Terrain Crane would help out immensely in placing each floor of the the building on each other. This is a very versatile and legitimate vehicle that can be seen cruising in a construction sight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>What I enjoyed about this set:&nbsp;</b></h2>

<ul>
	<li>This building process was extremely flawless yet surprisingly&nbsp;challenging. I deem myself as a very experienced builder and this model took me at least 12 hours to complete. The process smooth over the 13 numbered bags and made me satisfied when each step was complete. There was one point where I swapped two pieces out on accident and had to tear apart the model just to switch them. That said, I do want to stress that one must take close attention to all the pieces being used and where exactly they go to not cause any frustrations that may come from the complexity of the set. I learned a lot of useful and beneficial building techniques to use for future models.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The structural realism of the set was very intriguing. After scouring various pictures of this type of vehicle, I can say that the designers took an immense amount of time to make every detail and piece useful for the integrity of the model. The model is extremely sturdy and makes for a great attention getter in any Lego room. As mentioned in the introduction paragraph, I build a lot of Modular building and did a few tests to see if the crane could support a floor of a building and it can!!!! I was extremely shocked at how easy it was for the crane to lift the floor off the ground and place it on top of the building. It was quite fun to utilize all the unique functions of the crane to construct the model (specifically th Parisian Restaurant). Every function is vital for the model to work, which is what every Technic fan loves to hear.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What I disliked about the set:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The one aspect of the model that I severely&nbsp;disliked was the turntable of the superstructure. When constructing that portion of the build, I noticed that the turntable would consistently&nbsp;turn with any little movement. The structure is built with eight similar wheel-like bits that are in-between two rings that the rack follows for the course. The whole crane structure is connected by a single axle in the driving portion of the model. It is loosely rested on the track with the eight wheels on it, making it very vulnerable for any sudden and manual movements. It deters form any purpose around utilizing the large motor that comes with the set. One could simply make the structure turn by moving it manually and not relying on the importance of the power functions. When the model does move with the power functions, it tends to pause every once and a while when spinning, causing for a loss of legitimacy.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Would I recommend this set?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>As stated in the title, I can think of no other model that can surpass as being the best model of 2018, in my mind. I truly enjoyed the complexity of the model and how detailed the building process was. There was no point where I was bored during the model, because every element produced an important portion of the beautiful model that came in the end. The gear system was immensely satisfying to construct and the power functions made the crane even more irresistible&nbsp;for any aspiring engineer. The hardcore Technic fan or local AFOL would have a fantastic building this exquisite set. The structural integrity&nbsp;and feasibility of the model in real-life made the price tag&nbsp;of the model a thing of the past with this monstrosity of a set. I am now very hopeful for the future of Technic and how they will incorporate real vehicles and brands in their construction sets. This set produces countless hours of fun and experimenting that is a crucial aspect of the Lego company&#39;s philosophy.&nbsp;</p>

"DutchFlyer","2019-05-05T18:25:24.063Z","Massively brilliant","<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>The <strong>Rough Terrain Crane (set 42082)</strong> - together with the <strong>Bugatti Chiron (set 42083)</strong> - was the top Technic set for 2018; IMHO it has made good on its promise. The whole thing weighs a ton, is massive in size, has many functions, takes hours to build and simply looks very good. It probably can compete with the Bugatti, can definitely compete with the <strong>Porsche GT3 RS (set 42056)</strong>, and outdoes the <strong>Mack Anthem (set 42078)</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, this set is probably not for everyone. Just like with the Porsche and Bugatti, most of the gearing is covered by panels and hidden deep inside the machine. I like this look, but I can see why it is not for everyone. There are a few things that could have been done (slightly) better, like the rigidity of the turning mechanism as well as the length of the four corner stabilizers; they feel slightly short.</p>

<p>Overall, this is an expensive set that its worth its money. If you look around, you can find it for a considerably lower price in some places. This is definitely a set worth saving for, and IMHO a top candidate for set of the year for 2018.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build experience is great fun, and takes many hours. The recommended age is given as 11+, and for once I agree with the designer. Some of the steps are not always completely clear in the manual, for one. It is also fairly easy to mess up with the structure (especially the base) when it is turned around and add pieces to the wrong side.&nbsp;The sheer size of the model (over 4000 pieces as well as its dimensions) complicates matters as well. I guess it took me well over 10 hours to complete at a leisurely pace. I was reminded to check things regularly when - somehow - the mechanism to raise the boom did not work at all. I ended up taking the superstructure apart and rebuilding it. This is one of those sets where you have to check regularly whether the gearing works properly!</p>

<p>The build is broken up in over 13 bags, and the divisions are (fairly) logical. The first 8&nbsp;cover the undercarriage, the final 5&nbsp;cover the superstructure. Most of the time there are multiple bags with the same number. There are a number of off-colour pieces (yellow, green), but in the end they are fairly well hidden. I can see why some builders have swapped them out though, as some of them remain visible.</p>

<p>There are many stickers to apply. Take your time, as them being off will be easily visible. The crane can be built without applying the stickers, but IMHO they definitely enhance the looks of the vehicle in the end. There is also some use of regular Lego bricks (the mirrors, panels&nbsp;and lights) as well as some old stile Technic bricks for the boom. Overall, the build process IMHO is as much fun as one can have with a Technic set.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, the build definitely fits what seems to be a bit of the newer style in Technic design: the gearing and core covered up by panels and plates. The incorporation of &#39;system&#39; Lego bricks and panels. The (number&nbsp;of) stickers. The addition of small accessories (like the boxes and bins for the tools and chains).</p>

<p>As far as the gearing and technical functionality is concerned, by and large this is IMHO a top notch set. The crane has to be pushed around, and the steering is done by hand. The operating wheel is nicely incorporated in the back. The rest of the technical functionality is operated by the motor. I like how one switch diverts the power either between the crane/lifting mechanism and&nbsp;the non-lifting elements (rotating the upper section and operating the stabilizers). The lifting mechanism (extending the boom, lifting the boom, and operating the winch) is operated by one handle activating the three relevant clutches. As a result, one cannot concurrently extend the boom, raise it and operate the winch. All has to be done sequentially. Personally I am happy with that decision from the designer, but I can see why some people would like to modify the system to be able to operate all at the same time. The needed modifications should not be too difficult to make.</p>

<p>The structure is also quite rigid, as it should be. There is miniscule flexing/bending in the boom-extension. The looks IMHO are quite good. There are no truly awkward open gaps, and the odd angles of the crane are executed nicely in the structure as well as the paneling. The engine and the battery box are integrated nicely (and covered up nicely) as well. The cabin is beautifully done. The whole exterior of the&nbsp;vehicle is as well finished as the likes of the Mack Anthem and the Porsche GT3. The parts of the house (the wall panels) are nicely done, and give you something to lift. The four stabilizers cannot extend enough to lift the vehicle off the ground, unfortunately.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, this is arguably the best Technic set of 2018. It has more parts, Power Functions, more Technic play features and is considerably cheaper than the Bugatti Chiron. Looking at the added complexity, the price hike compared to the Mack Anthem is not as big as it could have been either. All things considered, the RRP is quite reasonable, and currently this set can be found for considerably lower prices. If you like Technic, or simply constructing a big imposing model, this is definitely a set you should consider. I therefore hope that Lego will keep this set available for a very long time, giving people the time to save for this set.</p>
