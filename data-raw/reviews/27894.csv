<p>Back in July 2018 I didn&#39;t want to wait for the set to be released. Thus my first building attempt was done from early official pictures that were available from the internet (cf. my <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/52756"">review of 42075</a>). Eventually I could improve towards an operating version when photos of the inside modules were shown in forums, e.g. before instructions got published.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There is a good, useful selection of technic elements.</p>

<ul>
	<li>No new parts</li>
	<li>No unnecessary orange or brown parts</li>
	<li>3x5L beams in dark blue</li>
	<li>62.4 wheels are a plus</li>
	<li>I would like to mention that drivers seat is not blue</li>
	<li>Some non-technic parts are thrown in for the palette and drum</li>
</ul>

<h3>Assembly</h3>

<p>The model is assembled from smaller units that represent its functions:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Fork base</li>
	<li>Front axle (differential)</li>
	<li>Rear axle (steering)</li>
	<li>Gear for lifting</li>
	<li>Frame for tilt</li>
	<li>Two-cylinder motor</li>
	<li>Cabin</li>
	<li>Panels</li>
	<li>Mudguards (easily detachable)</li>
	<li>Rear wheel cover</li>
	<li>Lift and fork are done last</li>
</ul>

<p>These small building blocks allow to make adaptations of your choice. Functions can easily be replaced or extended. There is some space to do that.</p>

<p>The finished model resembles the forklift from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8872-1/"">8872 set</a> but is considerable larger.</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>It does what you expect from a forklift:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Raise/lower fork</li>
	<li>Tilt fork for-/backwards</li>
	<li>Rear wheel steering</li>
</ul>

<p>(There is a nice <a href=""https://brickset.com/article/37580/technic-fork-lift-trucks"">comparison with former sets by Huw</a>).<br />
Additionally:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Two-cylinder motor driven from front wheels via differential</li>
	<li>Pallette with drum - to play with and store away</li>
</ul>

<h3>Rating</h3>

<p>I like the colour scheme. The dark blue goes well with the yellow.</p>

<p>All functions are working well, but playability is somewhat limited:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Steering has been poorly done as the vehicle turns in the opposite direction of steering.</li>
	<li>The maximum lifting height is limited to 14..15 studs (only).</li>
	<li>As with previous forklifts, the tilt has only two useable positions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Because of its modularity and since there is plenty of space inside the truck I suggest that you try some modifications on this set.<br />
For example: It does not take many extra parts to fix the steering.</p>

<p>(Modification of lift mechanism that resembles the one from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8416-1"">8416</a>. Height is increased to 22 studs.)</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I originally rated this set with &quot;3&quot; because of the not-so-well done functions. However, I now included the fun time that I spent to improve and modify.</p>

<p>You need not to stop building with the completed set. This is a nice model that challenges you to tweak it to your own needs. There is plenty of space available to do so. It is possible to fit in a small actuator for tilt:</p>

"j_d","2019-01-24T00:56:13.307Z","lift alot","<p>This forklift is a great toy and display piece.</p>

<p>You turn the light on top of the cab to raise and lower the load.</p>

<p>You turn the exhaust pipe to steer.</p>

<p>There is a lever just below the cab for changing the angle of the boom.</p>

<p>Other features include simulated mirrors, moving pistons, cab details, and a cargo pallet.</p>

<h3>Pros</h3>

<p>This set never fails to intrigue anyone interested in how things work,&nbsp;looks great and is sturdy and playable.</p>

<h3>Cons</h3>

<p>The boom cannot lock itself into a vertical position.</p>
