<p>I felt like&nbsp;buying it, simply because I also have the Porsche 911 GT3 RS. And it was already a while ago&nbsp;since I bought a Technic set...Previews have been good, so lets go!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Box:</strong></p>

<p>The front of the box shows the Bugatti from the front-left side, on a blueish background. On the bottom-left hand side it says &quot;16+&quot; , &quot;42083&quot; and &quot;Bugatti Chiron&quot;. On the bottom-right, there is the Bugatti logo.</p>

<p>The back of the box shows the Bugatti from the left-back side. 4 detail pictures of the engine, the disc-brakes, and the interior.</p>

<p>Also the warning about the choking hazard in 179 languages, so, we&#39;re safe, I guess...</p>

<p>Once you cut the tapes and open the box, you&#39;ll find the same style of packaging as with the Porsche... On the&nbsp;left side, there are the 4 rims in a cardboard inlay piece. The box with the rims also holds the tyres and bag 13. The rest of the parts are divided over&nbsp;5 boxes.&nbsp; So, 6 boxes in total...Together with part 1 of&nbsp;the building manual, the boxes form a picture of the left front side of the real Bugatti Chiron... It is nice to just look at it for a while :-)</p>

<p>The sticker sheet is located underneath the 1st instructions booklet. Part 2 of the instructions booklet is on the center bottom, underneath that box... So, from center top to bottom: 1st booklet, sticker sheet, box, 2nd booklet, and 4 boxes around that...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Instructions booklets:</strong></p>

<p>The building instructions come in 2 separate booklets, the first book has 305 pages and&nbsp;479 steps. The first 23 pages tell the story about how this set came to be, basically</p>

<p>The second book has&nbsp;322 pages and&nbsp;the steps continue from step 480 up to 970. Step 970 builds the travel bag in 7 steps. At the end there is of course the parts list.</p>

<p>Both booklets have detail illustrations of the real Chiron on the front. Book 1&nbsp;has the headlight, and book 2 has the taillight detail.The backside of both booklets has the Chiron logo in white on a light blue background</p>

<p>In the 2 books, in between the several boxes, there are some pages with information on the building process and pictures of the real- and the LEGO Chiron</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p><strong><u>Box 1</u></strong></p>

<p>Box 1 has all parts for the back of the chassis, gearbox and engine.</p>

<p>You start with the chassis, but pretty quick you build the back axle and suspension as a separate build. Later the back axle is build into the chassis.</p>

<p>After that you will be building the gearbox as a separate build... The gearbox is huge, and the gear-shifter cogs are great. The Porsche 911 GT3 RS had a&nbsp;lever construction to shift the gears which now is replaced by a&nbsp;rotating axle. So, one rotating axle operates 4 gears, and -because of an awesome mechanical construction-&nbsp;the left part of the gearbox operates twice as fast&nbsp;which&nbsp;makes shifting gears go faster&nbsp;... Also the way the gears are kept in place is brilliant thinking...&nbsp;Wonderful job&nbsp;on this gearbox, LEGO!... really!</p>

<p>And then with some handling, the gearbox slides into the chassis.</p>

<p>The engine is also a great piece of work... A W16. The 2 top rows are just like a regular V8. but this engine has 2 extra rows of pistons underneath. The cogs that drive the 2 bottom rows are partly hidden on the front of the engine, and if you sync the bottom rows with the top rows, it looks awesome when it runs...</p>

<p>After that, you build some sort of cover that mounts to the engine and then the engine goes on top of the back axle. You lock it with some pins, and after some little add-ons this is the end of box 1.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Box 2</u></strong></p>

<p>Now we build the front of the chassis, with the front/reverse shifter mechanism. The front axle with the steering and suspension... Pretty straight forward, but I do like the 4 new brake-disc/wheel mount thingy.</p>

<p>Both the front and back axle have 2 shock absorbers on each side.</p>

<p>After the front axle mounts onto the chassis, you build the center cover that holds the front/reverse shifter, and the gears for the steering.</p>

<p>Then a gear assy that serves the gearbox, this time with 2 flippers that are attached to each other (if one is in front, the other is in the back). But the technical design is really awesome... The way the 4 gears are kept in place with a very simple rubberband-design. very well done!</p>

<p>A little gear assy is added for the steering, which goes pretty smooth, but that is without the wheels touching the ground.</p>

<p>Then the build continues on the chassis and the roof construction and now, things slowly are starting to get it&#39;s shape. It is all pretty straight forward, and it turns into a rigid construction.</p>

<p>When the front and back get together, the instructions say to line up the axles, and they slide into together so very easy... push a couple of pins, and add some reinforcement parts, and you finally see the actual size of the car&nbsp;we come to the end of book 1.</p>

<p>The car already looks pretty awesome, with the engine, and the suspension visible... I tried the wheels on it, and it really comes alive!!! lol... The tires are the same as on the Porsche, but the rims are new, and also, the Chiron rims, have 3 molded pins inside, while with the Porsche, the rims have 3 pinholes... In other words; The Chiron rims will not fit the Porsche just like that, and the Porsche rims will only fit the Chiron if you add 3 loose pins per rim.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Box 3</u></strong></p>

<p>It is time to do the bodywork... A lot of dark blue panels and parts for the back of the body. It starts with the engine cover, which has an opening in it to keep the engine visible Then you build the rear spoiler and it&#39;s mechanics, the curved roof panels.</p>

<p>Actually, it is like the Porsche, but ways of construction is more solid... The panels line up very well, and I really like the dark blue color.</p>

<p>After the back fenders. you will build the rear end. There is some regular LEGO involved. The left and right side are 2 panels with the Radiator Grille 2x1 plates, and the red panel construction for rear lights.</p>

<p>Then 2 sub builds of the bottom side edges of the car... These are slightly tilted outwards compared to the inner tapered side</p>

<p>This is also where you apply the first stickers; underneath the rear spoiler, there is a panel with the Bugatti logo, and a vertically placed curved panel with the Chiron logo.</p>

<p>Once box 3 is finished, the back of the car looks awesome, I&nbsp;also like the tapered sides, makes it kinda... I dunno, look fast! lol</p>

<p>The backside of the cars body&nbsp;is not finished yet, it goes on&nbsp;with box 4.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Box 4</u></strong></p>

<p>Box 4 starts with the 2 seats, which are in light brown color. Little panels on the sides, and the cushion parts are made of studded bricks... Seats are not bad, but I like the seats in the Porsche better</p>

<p>Nice detail, the headrest has a sticker on it of the Chiron logo, but since the headrests width is 3 studs wide, the word Chiron on the sticker is off center, so the sticker is not attached to 2 bricks... And the word Chiron is centered on the headrest.</p>

<p>After the seats, there is some paneling left... The sides of the engine cover, the side edges of the roof,&nbsp;and also the light blue 5x7 panel, behind the doors... This panel is also a little tilted, just like the dark blue outside- side... so to say :-)</p>

<p>It is very cool to see how the cars progress slowly crawls from the back to the front lol</p>

<p>After that it is going to be about the dashboard and the front fenders... This goes pretty quick. the dashboard is mostly paneling. The steering wheel has the Bugatti logo. Earlier in the instructions, when the steering mechanism was made, it was instructed to set the wheels straight with the steering axle is at 0 deg. (+). So the logo on the steering wheel is straight when the wheels are.</p>

<p>The cockpit has 3 dials by means of a sticker on a round 2x2 black tile. The middle dial is slightly overlapping the outside 2 dials.</p>

<p>The last step of box 4 is that you mount the light blue front fender panels and put a pin through it... I really do like the color scheme on this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Box 5</u></strong></p>

<p>With the parts from box 5 we get to build the front of the car. As expected, a lot of light blue parts.</p>

<p>The doors are next, first the right one, and then the left one. Build mostly out of panels, and also a black panel inside. This panel has a sticker with the door handle</p>

<p>The doors are curvy and on the bottom there is a side skirt with stickers of the gray curved line. On the doors it is&nbsp;stickers, and on the rest of the car it is a gray tube.</p>

<p>After some inside construction to keep the front fenders in place, you start building the front of the car. First the lower spoiler, which is in 2 parts and on the front connected by a black tube... gives the spoiler a beautiful round shape.</p>

<p>There is a lot of regular studded bricks used to make the front... The mesh above the front spoiler, then the light blue bumpers.</p>

<p>The headlights are 4&nbsp;reversed transparent 1x1&#39;s in a&nbsp;row, which jump in dept one third of a brick. With the headlight-covering panels, the front starts to look good.</p>

<p>The kinda oval shaped center with the Bugatti logo looks great, I love the grey/blue arcs... like there is a chrome edge on the center.&nbsp;&nbsp;after the hood (under which the special serial number is located, printed on a white 1x4 tile),&nbsp;and 2 light blue tubes for lining in the hood, is the end of box 5.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Box 6</u></strong></p>

<p>Box 6 is the box where the rims are located in... When you take out the rims, you see disc brakes printed on the box. Inside there are the&nbsp;4 tires, and parts bag 13.</p>

<p>Time for the finishing touch. The sides of the windshield are first...They are doubled: One axle that connects the roof to the bonnet, and alongside, a dark blue strip with tapered ends, very nice.</p>

<p>More details like the tubing on the side and the top, the rearview mirrors, and the coolest, the top of the engine... One downside, the rearview mirrors do not rotate, so they are in a 90 deg angle with the body.</p>

<p>Then the wheels... The rims look great. Blue with a chrome top finish. The rims stick slightly out of the tires. Like mentioned before, the rims have pins inside instead of holes, that makes rhe wheels of the Porsche and Bugatti not inter changeable. The tires are the same as on the Porsche. The bugatti wheels have, just like the Porsche, a round 1x1 tile with the logo printed in the center.</p>

<p>And ofcourse the travel bag with the Chiron logo on the sides, and a zipper sticker on top, which goes in the trunk underneath the hood.</p>

<p>I did not build the key to operate the rear spoiler because, well... Its just stupid. If you have a mechanism, make it that it can be operated on the car, I mean, what am I going to to with that key when I&#39;m not operating the wing?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>The finished model</u></strong></p>

<p>And there it is, the mighty Chiron... It looks phenomenal, The dark and light blue color scheme is a great choice, great curves and lines, and the car looks very real, especially the front.</p>

<p>Also the sides are very well designed with the curve from top to bottom, and the rear spoiler that sinks into the body is very well done.</p>

<p>Technically there were a lot of new building techniques, especially the gearbox with its new gear shifter cogs</p>

<p>When it comes to shaping the car, it was&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;like the Porsche, but what I always like is when Technic sets use regular studded bricks</p>

<p>More downsides is that the engine cover does not open, the steering wheel is badly accesable, and very slow to respond, and the seats are ugly, and there is a stupid key for the rear wing.</p>

<p>For me sets are for display purposes, It looks great on the shelf next to the Porsche, so all in all, I feel it was worth the money</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><u>Should I get this set?</u></strong></p>

<p>Yesss especially if you already have the Porsche</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><u><strong>Thanks for reading</strong></u> :-)</p>

<p>But, could be improved further especially on certain parts of the car. The front side, the side doors and certain parts at the back side of the car could be made to hold more firmly. Those parts seem to be a bit loose in holding the whole set together for playability. Hope LEGO can improve those things.</p>

<p>Else, it is just a perfect rock solid set that hold the &#39;Technic&#39; brand name...</p>

"RoboticBricks","2020-05-06T20:52:44.14Z","Incredible Set with a Surprisingly Fun Build","<p>The LEGO Technic Bugatti Chiron is truly a wonderful set that shows the mastery of the Technic designers. While the finished build does have many unrealistic gaps and holes, it looks pretty darn good considering that the car is made is out of LEGO.</p>

<p><strong>The Box</strong></p>

<p>The Chiron comes in a hefty blue box very similar in design to the 42056 Porsche. The way the box is opened along with the layout of the part bags allows for a premium and luxurious feel to the set. Unlike a typical box where the parts would just be dumped out, the Bugatti&#39;s parts are separated into several boxes that allows for an easier (less intimidating)&nbsp;assembly. There are 13 bagged sections&nbsp;in total.</p>

<p>The box also showcases two hefty instruction manuals that show features &amp; dramatic pictures&nbsp;of the real-life Chiron along with a brief description of the real car. While they do the job, I personally feel this was a missed opportunity by the LEGO group to make a large spiral-bound instruction manual like they did for the Death Star or the UCS Millennium Falcon. I found myself having to weigh down the instruction booklets to prevent the pages from turning on me mid-build.</p>

<p>As for the stickers of the set, there are a fair amount, but nothing like you would get with&nbsp;builds such as the Ninjago City modulars.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>I found the build of the Chiron to be surprisingly&nbsp;quite fun. The build is quite challenging but it is fascinating to see all the different techniques used by the designers. The car is built in two main sections before the &quot;Marriage&quot; of the two and eventual exterior design.</p>

<p>The build took me around 18 hours in total to complete. Although Technic sets can be quite exhausting to build, I found it quite addictive to build as you watch the car take shape. Much like reading a good book, the Chiron was joy to build.</p>

<p>There are also a ridiculous amount of Technic pins in this set that make the model very sturdy. That being said, if a slight mistake is made early on in the build, it could be very challenging to correct it later in the build. Luckily the instructions are very clear on where everything goes.</p>

<p><b>The Finished Product</b></p>

<p>The finished car is a LEGO behemoth. The finished product measure 5 inches (14cm) high, 22 inches (56cm) long, and 12.5 inches (32cm) wide!</p>

<p>The details on this set are very good given it is made out of Technic. It is clear the designers did the best they could with all the curves and angles. The wing on the car looks and works great, however, the buildable &quot;key&quot; that is supposed to be used to adjust the wing is a bit unnecessary. I find it much easier to just adjust the wing using my hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is even a unique serial number printed on a tile beneath the hood in addition to a small compartment that perfectly fits luggage/the buildable Bugatti handbag that comes with the car. The exclusive rims look great on the car and roll smoothly (as long as the car was built correctly). There is also a fun little gear system using the PRNDL in the car&#39;s interior. It is also fun to watch the pistons work as the car goes forward and back, although I&#39;m not sure this would be too much fun for anyone below the suggested age of 16+.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>All in all, the LEGO Technic Bugatti Chiron (42083) is a wonderful addition to LEGO&#39;s 1:8 scale&nbsp;cars. The price on this set seems a little steep, but that is made up for with a fair price-per-part ratio of 9.7 (in the U.S.) with a whopping 3,599 piece count. I was lucky enough to get this set on sale which made this set seem like a bargain. The Chiron sets the bar very high for the rumored Lamborghini coming in June.</p>

<p>While the build is challenging, it is also quite educational, and the final product is absolutely phenomenal.</p>

"Naylor_Chief","2022-12-28T17:29:34.923Z","STILL one of the best. ","<p>I know this set came out a while back, but I still think of it now like I did then, and that is that it&#39;s one of the best sets&nbsp;<strong>ever</strong> released by Lego.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Big shout, I know.&nbsp; &nbsp; But I do have reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Firstly,&nbsp;</em><strong>Look at it.&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;</strong>Let&#39;s be honest, some Technic sets aren&#39;t always cosmetically pleasing, but this looks fantastic and really portrays the Chiron in all its beauty. Plus the box presentation is just so pleasing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Secondly,&nbsp;</em>the attention to detail is brilliant, working forward, neutral &amp; reverse gears that connect to a little W16 engine. Plus of course the little touches you&#39;d expect from Lego.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Thirdly,&nbsp;</em>it&#39;s such a nice build. Whereas some sets can feel a bit repetitive, a bit repetitive, a bit repetitive, this one doesn&#39;t.&nbsp; It&#39;s such a joy to watch it all come together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This one will be a classic for years to come.&nbsp;</p>
