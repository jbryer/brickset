<p>It&#39;s one of those sets where you have to break up one design to make another one.</p>

<p>This would be ideal for a young child as a starter Lego kit.</p>

<p>I actually added pieces from my own collection of spares to make all the designs shown in the leaflet without breaking up a previous one.</p>

<p>Playability - well there isn&#39;t really any play factor in this set.&nbsp; A young child could make some quacking noises but that&#39;s about it.</p>

<p>Value for money is not good unless you can get the set for a very low price.</p>

<p>As I said earlier this would be a bit of fun for a young child.</p>
