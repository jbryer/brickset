Oh, I Need It!!!","<p>&nbsp; Well it&#39;s &quot;Limited Edition&quot; because the Minifig it&#39;s on other places.&nbsp;But for a Magazine it&#39;s perfect with two lightnings and an odd golden weapon who wouldn&#39;t like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; Overall it&#39;s my first LEGO Ninjago Movie Jay so he is great with that hair.</p>
