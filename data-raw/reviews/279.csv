Best of all, they were free with the meal, which makes me wish I hadn't been against Bionicle at the time. :(

Unfortunatley, the feet are hard to use in Mocs, and the arms impossible, but why should people complain if these guys were free? So, nice set overall. 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It was quite easy to build and when I shot the disk it ricochet off our Micky D's table and went onto another family's table. OOP's! every thig about the set including the special mask is good. The only problem is those STUPID FEET! But they do have one advantage, if you move them back and forth he will do a little Po-Matoran Hula Hip Shake Dance, wich is pretty funny.

I was lucky to get this and another set from my uncle. Any who, the pieces are quite useful for building a little bigger matoran. The disc is also useful. 4 out of 10. They could have added a little bit more.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T07:07:54.873Z","McDonalds finally makes something worthwhile","So McDonalds has created a decent Happy Meal (just around the time I ate them!) and with it, a free LEGO set. Though this does not have the bricks that the previous LEGO/McDonalds kits had, it does however have Bionicle masks. The torso is really cool and can serve many creative purposes. The head is really blocky, but has been used often since its creation. The throwing arm, though bsed on throwbots technology, is not as good as the powerful throwbot arms, or the Vahki pincers to come.

This particular matoran is amongst the better few. The color scheme is good, and the mask and disk are faithful. I'm pretty sure the mask here is a lighter brown than Pohatu's so it is kind of good to get a new mask.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-09-14T20:25:20.95Z","Adorable","My first Bionicle review. I decided to start at the beginning.
All of these ""McToran"" are adorable. They don't have much playability, but the colors, the detail, and everything makes them amazing.
Huki (now Hewkii) is very good. The Kanohi Kakama is a dfferent shade of brown, not matching Onewa or Pohatu. The tan color of his body compliments his Mask and feet color. The disk also flings well from his right arm. He is also able tocombine with two other Matoran and make a Kaita or combine with the other Matoran and make the Matoran Nui. 
Overall, he is a great addition to the collection, but do you have to get him? No, I don't believe so unless to complete the collection. A nice pocket-sized set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"IndyMan","2009-05-07T18:34:08.28Z","Small, but cool!","I didn't get him in a happy meal, but I bought him at a store. There's not much to say about this little guy, but he is cool!

Pros: Old Mask, disc, and disc can shoot pretty well!

Cons: Left arm does not hold a disc.

Overall, 4/5! Thanks for reading!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"themetallicbrick","2009-12-17T01:26:33.5Z","oh the memories...","what a great set, well i know its small but the pieces are so rare these days. I don't own this set currently, but I still remember all the details. 
Anyway thats just my opinion 
What is rely cool about ALL these Mcdonalds Bionicle sets is that they can be made into fish, yes fish-type things that throw the disks with their tales, anyway to make it into the piranha thing you simply take off the legs and the arm that doesn't hold the disk and put the head where the non throwing arm was and you should have something that looked like a piranha to me years ago.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BobaFett2","2010-09-06T22:45:56.11Z","A nice set, but it's not great.","I've been searching forever for the ""Tohunga"" (name change due to LEGO being sued by a Pacific Island tribe for use of that word). All of them too expensive, even on bricklink. I happen to have two of this set (3 of the Onepu) and with the Nuparu from the Boxor could build the Matoran Nui. It rocks.<br><br>Anyways, I got this set when I was little, one of the first BIONICLE sets I had ever owned. It also included a cool comic (I loved the older art-in 2003 they changed the feel of the art...to something sleek and shiny...).<br><h4>Playability &amp; Value for Money<br></h4>Nice set when it comes to this. If you have fond memories of the Mata Nui Online Game or the older BIONICLE videos/games, you will not be dissapointed. These ""Tohunga"" look exactly like them. They throw disks, they have two great kaita, and there are some cool things that you can do with them. I usually rant about how it's too few parts for the price but something about these little guys just makes it worth it. They've got a lot of memories in them and for a Diehard BIONICLE fan any price between 0-6 dollars should be worth it. Any more and you could probably just buy the parts on bricklink for a cheaper price.<br><h4>Building Experience &amp; Parts</h4>There's not much to say about either with such a small set but the Disk Arm is a rarity (appearing in 7 sets, this is the only one in which it is tan). The mask and feet are in a special shade of brown, which is nice, and it comes with a cool bamboo disk.<br><h4>Overall</h4><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Nostalgia for many.</li><li>Nice impulse gift when you don't have much to spend.</li><li>Every part in this set is unique in it's color, minus the mask and the feet (returned in the larger matoran Hewkii-renaming- of 2003).</li><li>Nice disk, for those who like them.</li><li>Great Kaita.</li><li>If you love BIONICLE comics, you'll like this one. It's simple, but it's got some great artwork. If you can't find it with the comic, you can probably read it online.<br></li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Most people don't know what they're worth. Always too expensive. If you ever see all of them in a cheap lot, buy 'em. If you don't like them, they're resale value is high.</li><li>Mostly only from McDonald's making it quite rare.</li></ul>Overall, for it's size, this is quite a nice set. If you want to buy one for someone, the best age range would probably be young BIONICLE fans to maybe 8-9 years old (afterwords, it just isn't as much fun due to size and difficulty to use parts).<br><br>As with all of my reviews, these are my opinions. If you don't agree, that's perfectly fine. You choose what you like and buy-I wouldn't suggest going crazy for one of these sets if you didn't know about them before reading this.<br>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,5
"123MrBrick","2015-07-15T00:28:33.573Z","Huki, the Greatest Koli Ball Player!","<p>I recently got 5 of the McToran (the six McDonalds Bionicle figures) from ebay and I am very happy with them. Huki is very cool and there is just something about him that draws me to this particular McToran.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I got these figures loose so I can&#39;t really say anything here. Look at Brickset&#39;s picture if you want to see the polybag.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Huki shares all of his parts, with the exception of the mask, with his fellow McToran. However, Huki features the parts in unique colors. I really like his Bamboo Disk, which features the Kanohi Kakama on it, and the Kakama itself, which is cast in orange-brown plastic this time.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set takes maybe 30 seconds. There are only 8 parts in the set, and it is extremely simple to peg it all together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really like the finished product. While it is not the most realistic design, the figure still looks cool. He has several features: his right arm will throw the included Bamboo Disk when pulled back; his other arm will &quot;punch&quot; when pulled back, and he can store his Bamboo Disk on his back. I am kind of worried that the arms will break, but so far nothing has happened. I&nbsp; have not been able to knock his mask off with a punch or Disk throw, which is kind of disappointing.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set will really only appeal to Bionicle fans. Unless you really want to get the whole set of them, I think getting one McToran will bring you the same amount of fun as getting all of them. I mainly got these for the Kanohi masks.</p>

I spent years trying to find the best opprotuninty to get him! I finally got a good deal and bought him. I was overjoyed to get him! however, it is a five second build but has good playability because of storyline (he is a great athlete).

A LEGO set AND heart-attack inducing chunks of question-mark chicken? Where do I sign? Oh right I was a kid I didn&#39;t have to sign anything! Just had to pester my parents enough to take me there. Oh memories of that ball-pit, I can still smell the discarded diapers (psychiatrist&nbsp;says I&#39;m making great progress).</p>

<p>The set is just a bare-bones Bionicle&nbsp;set, like 3 parts with a disk that you can shoot at your brother when he tries to steal one of your fries. Yeah yeah LEGO instructions, I see your &quot;don&#39;t hit anyone in the face&quot; warning. This was back in the wild west days of lawsuits, don&#39;t need no rules to ruin my good time.</p>

<p>So instead of describing these sets, I&#39;m just going to copy paste the&nbsp;last paragraphs and instead describe the amazing sodium and trans-fats meal I had.</p>

<p>For this set I had a 4-pack chicken nuggets Happy Meal. I think it was this day that I truly fell in love with the boot-shaped chicken nuggets. Those diamond-shaped hussies&nbsp;can just keep on walking because I&#39;m not into that thank you very much. We went to Micky Dees after swimming lessons, where I dropped like a goddamn rock, I mean swam as gracefully as a swan. Overall worth it!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>Huki came in a small polybag, with his picture and other info on it.&nbsp; A McDonald&#39;s logo is in the lower corner.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p><strong>Mask</strong>: The Kanohi Kakama, the mask of speed.&nbsp; My favorite 2001 (maybe even the entire G1!) kanohi, due to it&#39;s shape.&nbsp; This mask appears in two sets in this color.</p>

<p><strong>Head</strong>: Huki&#39;s head is the basic McToran head, that was never used in anything else.</p>

<p><strong>Arms</strong>: Standard McToran arms, the left arm can be bent back to throw disks.</p>

<p><strong>Torso</strong>: Again, a standard part for 2001 Matoran.&nbsp; This one is more useful than the others, though, due to it&#39;s axle/peg connections.</p>

<p><strong>Legs/Feet</strong>: The foot/leg hybrids are unique to the McToran and Bohrok Va.&nbsp; Huki&#39;s are light brown, like his mask.</p>

<p><strong>Disk</strong>: Huki&#39;s disk is black, with a stone Kakama print.&nbsp; The printing looks awesome.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Over in a couple seconds, just &quot;click click click click click snap slide.&quot;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Huki is a small model, less than&nbsp;half the size of a Toa Mata.&nbsp; He has the same mask as his respective Toa, Pohatu, and a similar color scheme.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>
