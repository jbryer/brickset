<p>The Great Wall of China is quite a sizeable set, and as it turns out, surprisingly heavy. Quite a bit of time is spent on constructing the base, including the green cover. In the end the wall is put on top. I liked the build overall, as the designer has prevented the build from becoming tedious, which is not that easy. There are one or two interesting solutions to get the right angles in the structure, and get the wall fixed to the &#39;mountain&#39;. I like the idea that one could extend the wall by adding another element next to it. Overall, IMHO this is a good set that does what it is supposed to do: it looks like the Great Wall on a hilly section and - at least for the architecture range - for an acceptable price</p>

<h2>Building the Great Wall</h2>

<p>As with the other sets in this serieas, things start out with constructing the base, which, in this case, is combined with laying the ground layer of the superstructure.The endplates or not the normal rectangular plates, but wedge plates placed next to each other, presumably so it makes it easier to connect two sections - and so create a greater wall. Next is building up the &#39;mountain&#39;, coloured (white/yellow/brown/dark tan) bricks on the inside, covered by the dark green bricks. Lighter green studs and 4x4 round pieces represent shrubbery and trees. Having looked at it for a while, I think this was a good choice by the designer. Putting in some grey, light green and olive bricks would probably have ended up making the design too busy, and distract from the wall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building of the wall is somewhat repetitive, though not yet tedious. There is enough variety in construction techniques to keep things interesting. I really likes how the designer managed to create all the angles, and getting the sections of wall and towers nicely integrated into the mountain. Favourite is the way the lower tower is attached. There are no truly massive gaps along the wall sections, though there are one or two along the battlements.</p>

<p>Overall, the construction of the set is easy, but pay attention to the colours of the plates. With bad lighting, the difference between light tan and light grey is not always immediately evident, and had me at least pick the wrong part in a few occasions.</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>This set is obviously a display set.</p>

<h2>The verdict&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The Great Wall of China is obviously one of the most famous man-made structures on earth, yet is a somewhat odd duck within the Lego Architecture line-up. It is neither a sky-line nor a clear single building. That said, I do feel it right to see it incorporated in this line-up. As with most architecture sets, it is dominated by one or two colours, in this case light tan and dark green, of which there are a great number of bricks in this set. The build is OK, and quite easy. The final model looks good, IMHO. There is the option to get a second set, and expand the wall, either by simply linking the two sets together, or by trying to make one&#39;s own creation. At RRP, this set is IMHO fairly priced - it is on the expensive side, but so are all architecture sets. Overall, I am happy I got the set.</p>
