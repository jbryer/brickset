<p><em>&quot;The Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World&quot; was a gift of friendship from the people of France to the United States and is recognized as a universal symbol of freedom and democracy. </em></p>

<p><em>The Statue of Liberty was dedicated on October 28, 1886.&nbsp; It was designated as a National Monument in 1924.&nbsp; Employees of the National Park Service have been caring for the colossal copper statue since 1933.</em></p>

<p>LEGO has captured the spirit,essence with some incredible techniques and shaping&nbsp;with this top of the line <strong>Architecture</strong> build. The breakdown below:</p>

<p><strong>BOX ART/Graphics...</strong></p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1768/42633125995_dbc03e317b_c.jpg"" style=""width: 567px; height: 800px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>BAG(s) 1...</strong>You build up the lower pedestal of the statue and the base of the model with a printed &#39;Statue of Liberty&#39; plate.</p>

<p>The instruction booklet is very well printed with wonderful photography detailing some highlights of the historic monument.</p>

<p>Dug out an old mini Statue of Liberty to help with the build (not included in this set ;)</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1826/42633126115_7e46293c03_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 800px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>BELOW...</strong>Top panel shows an interesting technique to the corner elements of the pedestal.</p>

<p>Middle panel show the results from Bag 1 (notice the excellent, new pyramid 1x1 elements).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bottom panel onto Bag(s) 2.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1830/41747270000_965e1a753c_b.jpg"" style=""width: 461px; height: 1024px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>BAG(s) 2...</strong>Below, building up the facade of the pedestal. Repetitive, but nice side building techniques throughout.<br />
Right panel, Bag(s) 3 spread out and readying for those red support struts.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/930/42860327704_78dc27bec0_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 534px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>BAG(s) 3...</strong>Building up just about the rest of the pedestal and you also see the support strut jutting out (which will be used to lock in Lady Liberty&#39;s core body).<br />
The pedestal is very solid, heavy and sturdy.<br />
Bag(s) 4 there readying to tackle some of that sweet sand green/patina!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/928/29727110248_e96d845143_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 518px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>BAG(s) 4...</strong>Below, Panel 1; we&#39;re sculpting out the back of Lady Liberty with some nice shaping of the folds.<br />
Panels 2 and 3 show the inner core of the statue. The support strut locks this all in and makes it very sturdy.<br />
Panel 4 shows the last bags (5) parts to flesh out the final stage of the build.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/855/42772485405_00c49f276b_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 800px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>BAG(s) 5...Finished build...</strong>I like the abstract nature of the model.</p>

<p>I was first put-off by the flat face shield but you know, it works!</p>

<p>Overall it goes well with the model. The other mods I&#39;ve seen make it seem like it&#39;s either an Easter Island looking face or like a robot. This shield piece at this scale and the overall abstractness works.</p>

<p>Incredible job by the designer mimicking the folds with these slope/curved pieces and grills at the bottom. Brilliant job.</p>

<p>The Crown is well done, the arm grip with tablet excellent and that right leg bent back gesture is another triumph.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only real problem with the model is the stiff straight right arm. This is the section that appears &#39;mechanical&#39;/robot like.&nbsp;<br />
And somewhat the long neck looks awkward too, especially if you&#39;re looking at it straight on (there is a simple solution though).</p>

<p>Overall, still a great build from the excellent and pretty accurate base/pedestal to the brilliant techniques for the statue itself, I proudly have it on display.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/848/41987286520_4dc1081337_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 534px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>BELOW...</strong>Panel 1 - Here is the original neck which many others (that I agree with) feel is just a bit too long. Looks awkward especially looking at the model straight on.</p>

<p>Panel 2 - I got the idea from JK Brickworks (not to modify the face - I&#39;m actually fine with the abstract nature of the whole statue), but to &#39;shorten&#39; the neck a bit.&nbsp;<br />
Took out the 2x2 round plate, put two 1x2 sand green plates here (JK used a 2x2 square plate).&nbsp;It&#39;s what I had handy.&nbsp;<br />
Transitioned nicely and made the neck appear shorter.<br />
Replacing the bottom round tile idea by JK works fine.</p>

<p>Super simple, but I&#39;m really happy with it. Took some of the awkwardness away from the face and neck.</p>

<p><strong>BELOW...</strong>Great job the designer did here with that right leg gesture bent back. Brilliant.<br />
The grip gesture on the tablet in the left hand is excellent too.<br />
Nice touch showing the &#39;broken&#39; shackles at Lady Liberty&rsquo;s feet.</p>

<p><em>When Eduoard de Laboulaye&#39;s Statue of &quot;Liberty Enlightening the World&quot; was completed, it not only represented democracy but also symbolized American independence and the end of all types of servitude and oppression.</em></p>

<p><strong>BELOW...</strong>Great job to recolor that hair/wig piece for the lamp flame blowing in the wind.</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Give me your tired, your poor,&nbsp;<br />
Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,&nbsp;<br />
The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.&nbsp;<br />
Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed, to me:&nbsp;<br />
I lift my lamp beside the golden door.&rdquo;&nbsp;<br />

<p>Didn&#39;t realize til I pulled out the last bags, inside the box, a little quote from Charlie Rangel.<br />
Nice quote, but being a lifetime New Yorker it was very inappropriate to quote this man.<br />
Wish Lego went with a different individual.</p>

<p>Ah, regardless,&nbsp;the side of the box text is what&nbsp;it&#39;s all about!<br />
It really is an excellent kit, with fun, new and interesting techniques.</p>

<p>Enjoy and savor through the steps, especially the shaping techniques for the folds as well as the side build techniques.</p>

<p>A joy to build and to behold...</p>

<p><em><strong>EXCELSIOR!!!</strong></em></p>

"DutchFlyer","2019-08-10T10:35:52.393Z","Good, but not the best...","<p>When the Statue of Liberty was released in the architecture line, it quickly jumped high on my wishlist of architecture sets. Having built it,&nbsp;I am not disappointed, but I am not wowed either. In the end, I would consider it overpriced for its original price, and personally prefer&nbsp;<strong>set 21046, Empire State Building</strong>&nbsp;for the RRP.</p>

<p>The build of the Statue of Liberty is interesting, though on occasion somewhat tedious as there is quite a bit of repetition during construction - most notably the corners of the statue base. This is not surprising as a big part of the build involves the symmetrical base. Moreover, even though different in shape, the construction of each piece of cladding is quite similar. However, in the end&nbsp;the result of the repetitiveness does feel rewarding when one looks at the model in the end.</p>

<p>The quite interesting techniques used compensate that to a large extent for this repetitiveness: studs <em>inside</em>, some sideways, a lot of SNOT, and the torsion bars used to strengthen the core of the statue. It very nice to see how based on a single core, by providing different layers of cladding the shape of the statue emerges eventually.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The Statue of Liberty is one of the most famous, and therefore most photographed statues in the world. Also, you get to see the Lego statue from viewing angles that you will never see the actual statue.&nbsp;As a result, when compared to the vast majority of images&nbsp;the statue looks a little off.</p>

<p>That starts with the size of the base in comparison with the statue. My first impression was that the base was too big. In reality, the dimensions in comparison with the statue are more or less correct with the actual statue. The second issue is the problem of replicating the folds. On the actual statue they are &#39;free flowing&#39;, something that simply cannot be reproduced in Lego form in this scale. The face - heavily critiqued by many - has the same issues. Whatever solution proposed, it will always be flawed. As such, it looks much better from a distance than up close.</p>

<p>The designer overall has done a very good job in recreating the base (which is superb) and the statue. From a distance, the dress if the statue is indeed somewhat free flowing. Likewise, from a distance the flat shield becomes less of a nuisance as face of the statue.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this is a good set, and definitely shows the high quality that we have come to expect in the Lego Architecture line. It is also a set that shows the limitations of Lego bricks when trying to capture a natural form in set of limited size.&nbsp;The problem I have with this set is its RRP. The PPP is good (quite possibly very good for an architecture set), but the Statue of Liberty&nbsp;now faces the competition of the Empire State Building.... and IMHO the latter is the clear winner. If you can find the set for a discount, if you like the Architecture range or would like a miniature of a famous landmark, then IMHO you should definitely go for this set.</p>
