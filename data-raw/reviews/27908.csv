<p>The box is quite large, and from a child&#39;s perspective it amplifies the scope of the set. There are 4 mini-dolls, 3 water vehicles and of course - the resort with the mini-tram.</p>

<p>She managed to built it all by herself, which made her proud (and me as well). There&#39;s just one booklet, which is large enough and detailed&nbsp;enough to make the building experience fun. You build each section/floor by itself, and only then lay it out in the main build. This is a smart way to make things a bit easier for the child, as they don&#39;t need to handle the whole set with each bag and section.</p>

<p>The train runs smoothly, and adds a lot.</p>

<p>Once complete, the set is very impressive to look at. It&#39;s not that interesting of an architecture piece, but the detailing&nbsp;and the colours makes it shine. There are lots of small things to look for and find, as they tried to put some unique or fun elements with each section.</p>

<p>Daughter did notice that there isn&#39;t an elevator or stairs to the top floors, and the dolls needs to jump to get there. The rooms are more of &quot;pods&quot; than rooms, and quite small, but she didn&#39;t care that much for that, as the point of this set is having fun &quot;outside&quot;.</p>

<p>This is not a cheap set, priced $119 in Canada. I managed to get it on sale for $50 which was a very good deal, but I&#39;m not sure if I was comfortable paying the full price for that. Maybe $99 CAD tops.</p>

<p>However, there&#39;s one major design flaw with this set - it&#39;s VERY fragile. Moving it is almost impossible. They did make the left and right sections easy to disconnect (with pins, like the mansion from Scooby-Doo&#39;s set), but as the rear side of the building is open, when you push too hard on the above floor, the whole things can fall aprat. In order to move it you need to disconnect the tracks,&nbsp;and then take the right/left side apart. For an adult it&#39;s not that bad, but for a child it is.</p>

<p>I think the &quot;Adventure Camp Tree House&quot; from few years ago, which was also a large set, was&nbsp;much more robust. Even the &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; is easier to handle. This is a major flaw of a set aimed as a play set for a child.</p>

<p>All in all, she&#39;s happy with it, but I have a feeling that she might not play with it for long if moving it around will become a problem.</p>
