She likes using the boat in the bathtub. She pretends to eat the bread and drink the coffee.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a parent of a child with&nbsp;hearing impairment, I wish the flashing lights on the train were better. So I ended up adding the siren/flashing light piece from crane &amp; tower set to the train. This catches my daughter&#39;s attention, and she loves that addition to the train.<br />
<br />
My only other slight criticism is that the track pieces don&#39;t interlock more firmly and the train falls off the tracks very easily. However, as my daughter grows older I&#39;m sure she&#39;ll understand how to build and play with the tracks better.</p>

"BrickRandom","2021-01-31T22:00:21.27Z","Great way to start a Duplo railroad","<p>I bought this set as a birthday gift for a toddler turning 2 and it is a success so far. Building the entire set is beyond her skill and attention span at this age, but she loves playing with the train and minifigures.</p>

<p>The idea of the Push &amp; Go system appealed to me and it works quite well in practice. Simply push the train to get it going. If it runs into an obstacle or is picked up, it stops. Easy enough for any child to use. It didn&#39;t take the kid long to figure out the train runs just as well off the tracks as on the tracks! Only criticism I have, is that the train needs to be pushed quite a bit to get started and you are pushing again the friction of the motor. This sometimes makes it sound&nbsp;like it may cause wear in the gears (but which I think is actually the sound of the wheels slipping on the curved track, due to lack of a differential). It also made the kid uncertain she was doing it right at first. Also, you need to push the locomotive, as pushing the cars may derail them. These are minor points though, overall it works well.</p>

<p>The Action Bricks are fun. You put them between the rails to make the train do things (like make a sound, stop, or reverse direction). The Action Bricks are big, so they are easy to handle and put between the tracks. The kid likes the yellow one to make the train go toot toot. My favourite is the green one, to reverse direction. I would have liked an additional one of those, but unfortunately the green one is only included in this set and the Steam Train set #<span itemprop=""sku"">10874 (and the silly expensive education set #45025) and not included in the Train Tracks sets (#10872 and #10882)</span>. To my surprise, the underside of the Actions Bricks do not have anti-studs, so you can&#39;t connect them to anything and their only possible use seems to be to put them between the tracks.</p>

<p>The tracks included in this set build an oval with two dead-end sides, which is a great start. If you want to make anything more interesting, though, I recommend you get one of the sets with additional tracks. The tracks interlock fine, even on carpet, although on carpet they are prone to get dislodged is children step on them.</p>

<p>In addition to the train and tracks, the set contains a lot of extra fun parts. Like a cargo ship, two cranes and a refreshment shop. The set also contain three minifigures and a seagull, which provide for a lot of fun during play.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great set. But Duplo is an expensive toy. This one even more so, as I&#39;m guessing the electronics in the train drive up the price. The full RRP of &euro; 130 is to much in my opinion, just thinking of the amount of other children&#39;s toys you could buy for that amount of money. Happily, though, you do not need to pay full retail for this. Discounts of some&nbsp;30% seem common, and at that discounted price it is a great set.</p>
