<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The 58 Technic parts (of 21 different types) are a mix of&nbsp;axles, technic bricks, gears, pins, bushings, plates and beams.&nbsp;Most of the parts are rather common, so you may already have most of them:&nbsp;check the&nbsp;<a href=""https://rebrickable.com/sets/9781338219630-1/gadgets-klutz/#parts"">Rebrickable inventory</a>, which isn&#39;t linked to the Brickset entry as I write this.</p>

<p>The book includes 15 cardboard parts to punch out and&nbsp;fold to&nbsp;decorate some models, making them look more attractive and exciting, as seen on the first page below.&nbsp;Some extra blank cardboard parts are meant to be painted to your liking.</p>

<h3>Building Experience</h3>

<p>This is aimed at children aged 8 and over and for that target age&nbsp;I imagine it provides a good building experience, showing how gears work together and also some linkages.&nbsp;The instructions are clear and&nbsp;well laid out.&nbsp;The ring-binding keeps the book flat.&nbsp;Each model starts with a part list in 1:1 scale,&nbsp;which is very handy to quickly get the axle and brick of the right length.&nbsp;I can&#39;t comment on how easy or difficult it is to build the decorations&nbsp;and attach them to the models, as I haven&#39;t used the cardboard parts.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>The 11 gadgets were designed by Owen Keating,&nbsp;except two car models by Yoshihito Isogawa.&nbsp;I built 4 of the models.</p>

<p>The claw, shown above, is a nice example of a linkage mechanism,&nbsp;but due to the round smooth tips of the claw,&nbsp;it is not easy to grasp small objects.</p>

<p>The ghost guzzler, also shown above, is another example of a linkage mechanism,&nbsp;this one making the chassis of the car ebb up and down as it moves forward. It won&#39;t work well on a smooth surface: the wheels need friction to make them turn and lift&nbsp;the chassis.</p>

<p>Isogawa&#39;s flywheel cruiser, shown on the front&nbsp;cover, uses accumulated&nbsp;kinetic energy to move the card forward even after you let it go.&nbsp;The text and images in the book make you believe it&#39;s all about speed and&nbsp;pushing your car quickly, but I found the best way to see the effect is&nbsp;to gently pull the car with constant speed and let it go.&nbsp;It continues to move forward for a bit,<br />
whereas without the flywheel&nbsp;it immediately stops. Careful not to get a hand close to the spinning flywheel: the brick corners can easily cut your skin.</p>

<p>In Isogawa&#39;s other model, the gravity drop coaster,&nbsp;just let a vertical arm fall freely and the car will move forward.&nbsp;As the arm falls, its rotation makes the back wheel move, via gears.&nbsp;When the arm hits the surface and the rotation stops, the car would stop,&nbsp;but Isogawa devised a clever mechanism that makes the back of the car lift and&nbsp;continue its forward motion.&nbsp;Unfortunately, like in the previous model,&nbsp;there is not enough accumulated energy to make the car go far.&nbsp;It&#39;s a bit underwhelming after admiring the ingenuity of the mechanism.</p>

<p>Four other models are essentially the same: a spinner,&nbsp;only the thing being spun varies. The image above shows one of them:&nbsp;a cardboard zoetrope&nbsp;of a surfing shark.</p>

<p>The overall playability is good because on top of playing with each model&nbsp;(even though they&#39;re&nbsp;rather limited in what they&nbsp;can do) the authors suggest how to modify some models.&nbsp;Due to the limited number and type of parts, there is only so much one can do.&nbsp;Nevertheless, the simplicity of the models lowers the experimentation barrier.&nbsp;It&#39;s easy to put more weight here, change a gear there, and see what happens.</p>

<p>The book also includes 3 challenges: to build the highest tower,&nbsp;the longest bridge, and the most alphabet letters with the provided parts.</p>

<h3>Value for money</h3>

<p>The book has 78 pages and 6 sheets of cardboard.&nbsp;The RRP (&pound;14.99, US$24.99 and Can$29.99)&nbsp;is very reasonable, considering it&#39;s a full colour, glossy page book,&nbsp;with Lego parts and cardboard decorations.&nbsp;It can be easily bought below RRP, making it quite good value.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>While there is little of interest to an experienced Technic AFOL,&nbsp;that&#39;s not the target demographic.&nbsp;I think it&#39;s a quite nice, albeit very simple and limited,&nbsp;introduction to linkages and gears for children&nbsp;unfamiliar with Lego Technic, at a good price point.</p>

<p>I imagine the best way to use the book is to sit with them, build a model,&nbsp;discuss how to improve it, and tinker away.&nbsp;Most models are followed by a page that (very superficially)&nbsp;hints at the science behind the model and points to real machines,&nbsp;e.g. robots or windmills, that are related to the model.&nbsp;They can trigger further technical and scientific discussion and exploration.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you already have one of the previous Klutz books,&nbsp;it&#39;s probably not worth acquiring this one,&nbsp;as it&#39;s the same type of gadgets, mechanisms and challenges. While&nbsp;Isogawa&#39;s cars are quite &nbsp;different from those of previous books,&nbsp;their movement range and speed is quite limited.</p>
