"legoDad42","2018-09-15T07:20:14.637Z","Sparks the Imagination!","<p>Dorling Kindersley&#39;s&nbsp;LEGO Star Wars IDEAS book was a nice surprise with many alternate builds, mini-dioramas, games and much more than I expected.</p>

<p>Not just for the young builder but some excellent ideas to add to your moc&#39;s and existing kits. Although this is not for the seasoned master builder, it&#39;s perfect for a guy like me. I like to build and moc&nbsp;some but sometimes get stumped for ideas. Also for the parent who loves Star Wars and Lego to get some great bonding time with the many activities, builds and games you&#39;ll enjoy with your kid.</p>

<p>Writers Hannah Dolan, Elizabeth Dowsett&nbsp;and Simon Hugo put together an easy guide with activities that young and old will like and they&#39;re more than ably assisted by artist/builders Rhys Knight, Tim Goddard, Rod Gillies, Alice Finch, Barney Main and Kevin Hall churning out some clever and fun builds. Gonna&#39; break it down best I can...</p>

<p>The Book is broken into 4 chapters: <strong>Recreate, Expand, Challenge</strong> and <strong>Use It! </strong>with 17 sub-sets, which are great since you don&#39;t have to read or follow the book linearly. For example a sub-set gives you a theme or activity/idea to tackle and which&nbsp;pages have those particular ideas. A couple of the 17; <strong>Taking Off</strong> is for flight based builds, <strong>Just a Few&nbsp;</strong>for smaller builds, <strong>Less Than 15 Minutes</strong> for speedy builds, <strong>Lots of the Same Brick</strong> for builds using similar pieces. These are great for your kid and the young builder to go to a particular build based on how many parts they have handy. Have a lot of bricks, there&#39;s a subset for that, have a few bricks, no worries, you can enjoy a lot in this book. Kids and adults alike, new to the medium, also will learn some of the verbiage, brick types and uses.</p>

<p>Note: There are no step by step instructions. The photos are layed out very clearly and easy to figure out.</p>

<p>Below I picked out some ideas/builds that stood out to me but I tried not to show all since you&#39;d need to explore the book and enjoy each part and section on your own. So many inspirations to keep you and yours busy&nbsp;for hours. After the photos I list some of the highlights of the book&nbsp;and builds that are contained within.</p>
