<p>I have really enjoyed buying the Duplo trains for my kids. I was definitely excited to see when they had some new sets coming out this year. Then I saw the color of the track:(. light gray instead of dark gray.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros- cool set for Duplo&nbsp;trains</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons- changed the track color</p>

"DrFrankenstein","2020-01-14T19:03:17.983Z","Interesting but limited train expansion set","<p>The main attraction of this expansion set is the train bridge that brings some variety to the Duplo train tracks. The bridge enables two trains to cross each other without having to stop to avoid collision. It is unrealistically steep for a train bridge and the electric Duplo trains barely have the torque needed to climb it gripping the teeth on the track. Also, the bridge tracks don&#39;t align perfectly even on the flattest of the floors (I suspect moulding defects). Still, it does work as intended in our experience.</p>

<p>The eight straight tracks are also a welcome addition to the basic train sets enabling longer track builds. I am not sure why the train track worker was included in this set, since he feels out of place. Possibly he is there for Duplo to try to justify the higher price point of the offering?</p>

<p>This expansion set is not bad, but not great either at the price offered. However, if you are looking to add some variety to your kids&#39; Duplo trains, it will do. I just wish Duplo had included more tracks and perhaps a tracks crossing instead of worker figure and priced it more lightly.</p>
