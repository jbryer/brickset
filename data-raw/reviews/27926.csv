<p>My 5 year old, who had stopped playing with Duplo&nbsp;and as odd as it may seem,&nbsp;is the one who really enjoyed the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She&#39;s been playing for 5 days in a row. I don&#39;t know how the batteries last so long.</p>

<p>We used her old Duplo to build scenery like tunnels, forests, etc...</p>

<p>The old 123 train set can be added to this one. It is really cool to see a large train.</p>

<p>The sensors add so much to the play experience... That I can&#39;t really describe it. You have to try it to understand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Haven&#39;t tried the APP yet. Imagine it will be nicer for the 2 year old.</p>

<p>My 5 year old now wants me to get more track parts... But while we don&#39;t have them.... We made up a game.</p>

<p>The game is as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Build a track that doesn&#39;t connect star to finish.</li>
	<li>Make the train run.</li>
	<li>As the trains goes forward, disconnect&nbsp;the track parts behind the train and connect them again&nbsp;to the other end of&nbsp;the track, before the train reaches it and derails.</li>
</ul>

<p>The rules are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>use the sensor pieces to gain time before the train derails</li>
	<li>you may only use the red sensor piece on the station track part.... or not :)</li>
	<li>cheat... cheat a lot... LOL LOL</li>
	<li>spend time with your kids</li>
	<li>have fun :)</li>
</ul>

What sold me on it were the modern controller capabilities, the build simplicity that would be appropriate for young children, and the aesthetics of the train. It also looked like a substantial improvement over the previous generation basic Duplo train (10507). I am happy to report that this set delivered in spades.</p>

<p>The train looks great resembling a colourful amusement train ride. The train station and pine tree provide some outdoors atmosphere to the scenery. The squirrel and girl make unlikely yet entertaining passenger duo for the train serviced by a busy looking mechanic. The tracks provided are just enough to make a small oval run for the train but not much more, which is fine for a starter set that can be expanded with extra tracks and structures.</p>

<p>What is most impressive about the modern Duplo train platform is the motorized locomotive base which incorporates a controller that enables basic programmability a la Mindstorms simplified. A colour light sensor at the underside of the base enables the contraption to respond to five different coloured plates that can be placed on the tracks (the inputs). The train reacts with mechanical motion, sound, and light (or combinations). And if this is not enough, the platform supports Bluetooth connectivity to a mobile app that enables remote control of the train. The app is fun but not strictly necessary to enjoy most of the train&#39;s functionality, since it is designed to respond to push actions. The only function that is exclusive to the app is the ability to set the colours of the train&#39;s headlight. It is impressive to get this degree of sophistication in a Duplo train.</p>

<p>My daughter loves the train and was able to pick up the concept of placing color plates on the tracks to get the train to react very quickly. She also is able to piece together the train tracks with ease. The official age range for the train is 2-5 years old, but in my experience it is fine for a 1.5 year old with adult help.</p>

<p>The Push&amp;Go functionality is actuated via a rotary incremental encoder linked to the front wheels of the train base which rotate freely. The train requires to be pushed along for at least 1/2 track length to get going. I am guessing that it is designed this way so that it is not overly sensitive to getting picked up. The problem with this is that the rear wheels that are connected to the drive motor create a lot of drag and the feeling that the train is forced forward with some potential damage to its mechanism or wheel grips until it picks up and gets going. It does not feel natural and confuses my daughter. I learned to slightly lift the rear wheels off the track while giving the train a push to avoid the friction, but even this does not feel right.</p>

<p>Overall, we are quite impressed with this sophisticated elegant train and our daughter enjoys it very much. In terms of price, this is not an inexpensive toy, but feels reasonably priced for the functionality that it offers. I would recommend it with little hesitations for parents looking to introduce their little ones to trains at home. Just keep in mind that to get the most out of the experience you should plan on investing in a few tracks expansion sets.</p>

<p><strong>Update [year 1]:</strong> The train went silent (stopped producing sounds). I searched online and found a number of similar complaints. Some people reported being able to fix the issue by shorting some internal capacitors. I tried all the suggestions with no success. Contacted LEGO and they promptly sent a replacement train base. I am not sure if this is a widespread defect affecting the entire production or some subset thereof. I am guessing that LEGO is still working out the kinks of their new DUPLO trains platform.</p>
