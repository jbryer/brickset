<h3>GOOD THINGS:</h3>

<p>COLOR:<br />
Yes!! A&nbsp;beautiful bright pink color is used to build up this pig. The color does the model and the actual animal just. The gray on the belly is spot-on and the dark gray&nbsp;rounded 1x1 plates make excellent feet/legs/paws(?)</p>

<p>EARS:<br />
Yes!! Lovely big ears. Pigs do have lovely big ears, so it is good to see that this LEGO model has gotten a pair of them.</p>

<p>PRINTS:<br />
Yes!! The eyes are nothing special, but they suit our piggy right. Turning them in different positions gives you the opportunity to give different facial expressions to our little guy: form duffy to bright :D<br />
The print for the snout is superb and finishes of this model. It is absolutely critical for this build. I don&#39;t see any other use for it besides on this pighead, but I am sure other people will come up with various moc&#39;s showing of the possibilities of this rounded tile.</p>

<p>POSE-ABILITY:<br />
yes!! movable ears, eyes, legs, head, tail. It seems like everything about this model is changeable and that&#39;s perfectly fine.</p>

<h3>BAD THING:</h3>

<p>SHAPING:<br />
Some of the shapes or parts used&nbsp;are off. This is most visible&nbsp;with the tail, which is too long, not curly enough and has a different color then the rest of the figure. Also the snout is too flat.</p>

<p>And that is a shame: the 2 most notable characteristics about a pig (it&#39;s curly tail and it&#39;s protruding snout)&nbsp;are not modeled correctly. It is a little bit of a let down and the reason why, although the model has a lot going for itself and has a lot of positive things, it get&#39;s a fairly low score of only 3 stars.&nbsp;</p>
