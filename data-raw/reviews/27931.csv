<p>Lego monthly mini model build frog is very nice with one particularly great part useage .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>&nbsp;The build starting at the head has a pearl gold crystal piece as a crown atop a 2&times;2 green jumper , the eyes are the standard 1&times;1 prints and there is a suggestion of a tongue with a modified 1&times;2 red plate . The body and legs are nice two with a continuous yellow chest , outstretched rear legs and sloped back but the best part is the legs as the use a plant piece as the webed feet this is perfect and the legs are fine . The stand is just a 2&times;6 blue plate and two lime green plant parts and they are fine .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a very good in store build and I would definitely recommend it to many genres of Lego fans .</p>
