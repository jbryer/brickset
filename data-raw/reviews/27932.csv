<p>The tractor monthly mini model build tractor is a very good because unlike most of the rest it interacts with minifigures .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build has a very nice seating area with a steering wheel built on top of a wheel fender in red . The front and middle mainly consists of the engine area it is nicely tiled on top , nice lasers on the sides for texture , a nice exhaust and has a dark grey frog on a 1&times;2 red jumper , the front is textured well with two grill slopes in red .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a good set not great but good and I would still recommend it .</p>
