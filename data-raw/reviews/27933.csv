<p>The surfing Dragon is an interesting choice for a Lego set but not in a bad way .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>&nbsp;The build starting with the head has a 1&times;1 red cheese slope on the back for a spike , the eyes are the standard 1&times;1 prints and the teeth are just two 1&times;1 white studs . The body has two stubby little green arms , a big sloped stomach and some sloped legs . His wings and tail are also nice . The stand is a 2&times;6 white plate with a 2&times;2 jumper and clip connecting to his........... Surfboard .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a very well built Dragon that looks good from every angle but why is a mythical creature surfing any way it&#39;s still a good set but that question will linger in my mind for eternity .</p>
