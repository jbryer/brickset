<p>The monthly mini model build BBQ is a very detailed design with some very nice part inclusions .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build features a 2&times;4 black slope for a lid , a hotdog , a chicken drumstick , a hotdog bun , a printed control panel on a 1&times;4 dark blueish grey tile and a very nice grille build using a clip and three&nbsp;1&times;2 jumpers to hold the food along with many 1&times;2 sliver grill tiles to complete the look . The lower half has a modified 1&times;2 black brick with a clip on the side for a gas canister I believe and two pairs of small wheels to roll it around .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is surprisingly detailed and can interact with your figures well in a Lego city I personally own two of it and they work surprisingly well in numbers . I would recommend it to any people with a Lego city of anyone who appreciates a detailed small build .</p>
