<p>The Lego monthly mini model build scarecrow is very good a would fit greatly into a farm moc .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build starting with the the actual scarecrow uses the standard Lego witch hat , a plain orange minifigure head and a snot technique for the body , there is a very build for the arms which uses two light tan mop ends . The rest of the build resides in a 4&times;6 redish brown plate , there is a light grey rat a pumpkin build and some vegetable patch detail using a flower and two shrub pieces .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a good build and like other sets it can easily be incorporated into a farm moc because of that I recommend it .</p>
