She&rsquo;s a member of the Golden Trio and dressed in her school uniform minus the robes. A great little set to hunt down if you enjoy the aesthetic of the line, and in this review we shall discuss why.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: Hermione comes packaged in a nice dark coloured box. The packaging fits in great with the Wizarding World sets of that same year, an image is seen on the side of Emma Watson as Hermione. Overall a great package design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: The manual is folded in half. Other than this minor problem there are easy to follow along with build steps and a decent thickness/number of pages for such a set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Again with these sets you&rsquo;ll find a lot of useful elements, plates, tiles, 2x4 side-bricks with studs and a host of nifty printed elements representing Gryffindor colours. Great parts pack for folks looking to collect parts for MOCs.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with most sets in this range we get to see a lot of nifty build techniques and I find that most of the builds for BrickHeadz, while similar, are at least unique enough to each character that the steps often are still fun and satisfying to follow along with. Also easy and nothing stands out ever as being difficult or frustrating.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I am a great fan of this aesthetic. BrickHeadz to me are pure fun and creative. Giving you excellent characters in a brick-built fashion. Hermione as a model looks very impressive. She includes a book and a rod piece to represent her wand, both of which suit her character very nicely. The Gryffindor uniform is also very well implemented with some nice printed tiles showing off her necktie and skirt. Overall a great little model and an excellent display piece.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Fans of Harry Potter may prefer Minifigure based sets, but I personally think this is a great looking set and would recommend it strongly to fans of the BrickHeadz design. I especially feel that with each character they have a very interesting ability to make their hair look unique and designed in keeping with each character. It&rsquo;s such a shame that BrickHeadz are just so hard to come by after a while, if you are looking to get this be prepared to pay mark-ups on the secondary market. Strongly recommended.</p>
