That being said while I may be missing a load of sets I couldn&rsquo;t pass this up and Elsa was actually the second BrickHeadz set I picked up after Black Widow. Because Elsa is a very big favorite of mine, as it is with many and this set is extremely worthwhile for fans of the film.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: The box design for Frozen BrickHeadz includes a load of snowflake details in the package images and the artwork is prominent on the side of a very nice closeup of Elsa. Her BrickHeadz is shown very nicely on the front and really sells the set as a nice little buildable model to display.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: As I&rsquo;ve noted several times over these manuals work well, but due to the folded nature they can be irritating to work with unless you can get them to remain open while you flip through the pages and building the model can be a slow process while you fight with the manuals&rsquo; pages.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A very nice 1x4 brick is included in this set which is a printed element for Elsa&rsquo;s dress details. This set also includes some rather uncommon blue elements in a mixture of light and dark shades which are not often found in LEGO sets. Elsa makes for a very impressive parts pack on top of a great little set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I have praised the build techniques for these sets since I started getting into the Theme, but Elsa is a leap above what we&rsquo;ve seen before and it&rsquo;s all because of her dress. The way they manage to make that iconic dress from her big song number and turn it into a blocky little model design is just tons of fun. It&rsquo;s very different from some of the techniques I&rsquo;ve seen for legs on BrickHeadz. Then you get past her torso and start to work on her hair and it just screams awesome. I can&rsquo;t praise this build enough.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Elsa looks brilliant, her braided hair is on one side of her head and even in this brick built blocky design it looks great. The flowing cape she wears on her back and the dress build is equally brilliant as we get to see some of her leg at the bottom of the model. I think Elsa is my favourite BrickHeadz in my collection.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Buy this model. I mean, if you aren&rsquo;t a fan of BrickHeadz it doesn&rsquo;t matter, get this model. Everything about it is just charming and fun and it makes a great display piece sitting amongst other Disney LEGO sets. Granted some folks might be tired of the Frozen phenomena at this point, but this toy is a very solid toy and has a lot of impressive build techniques. I strongly recommend getting this one set as a very solid representation of the BrickHeadz Theme. Strongly Recommended.</p>
