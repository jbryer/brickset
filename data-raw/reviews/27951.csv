This particular set has some really nice ideas behind it, and features a smaller model for a BrickHead with Olaf.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: Anna &amp; Olaf come in a two-pack style box which is larger than a typical BrickHeadz box. It shows the models on the front with their numbers underneath them and artwork of the characters on the side.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: These are, naturally, the same as all of the other BrickHeadz sets. Even with both models in the same thick folded manual the pages are easy to follow along with. As with all of these sets though the folded nature of the manuals makes keeping them open rather irritating at times while trying to build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with most BrickHeadz sets this is a wonderful collection of parts for you to use to build the models or make your own interesting creations. You can get a fair number of 2x4 side bricks as always and some nice printed tiles and bricks for Anna and Olaf&rsquo;s detailing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Building Anna is the same as any other BrickHeadz, you get to enjoy quite a bit as you work on making the model. Olaf on the other hand is a much smaller model due to his size, so much like Blue from the Jurassic World set, you get to make a different and unique little model that fits in with the rest of the BrickHeadz from LEGO. I am consistently pleased and enjoy every new model built, despite some of the repetition in the skeleton builds, the overall model builds are highly satisfying.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Anna is in her standard dress design and has a very nice looking model. Her hair and cloak in particular stand out to me as some very nice techniques, her printed freckles add to her charm and the dress detailing is very impressively handled for a brick-built model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Olaf, as I noted is quite small, he is at least half the height of a standard BrickHead and features a lot of charm and personality with his printed buck-tooth mouth tile. He&rsquo;s mostly white, so he might get somewhat smudged with noticeable fingerprints as you build him.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">With BrickHeadz being somewhat rare and hard to find these days I still strongly recommend nabbing as many as you can if the aesthetic is something you enjoy. I find myself preferring these models to some of the regular sets I&rsquo;ve built in certain respects because they feature more innovative and interesting build techniques.</p>
