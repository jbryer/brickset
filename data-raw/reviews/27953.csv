Han and Chewie are from the Solo movie, but this is based on A New Hope in all it&rsquo;s glory.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The packaging for this is uniform looking, it&rsquo;s the same white with red details we saw with Vader, Rey, Kylo Ren and the rest from 2018. The back shows all the rest from this wave, which is really hard to find these days.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Leia has a lot of white, in fact the primary colour in this set is white. You&rsquo;ll also find some brown elements for her hair. An awesome parts pack here, though not a lot of unique elements for this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Another super fun build with this set. In fact I&rsquo;d even go so far as to say that the hair is really, really impressively handled. I just dig this one aspect of the build, the iconic hair buns aren&rsquo;t easy to capture in toy form, but here they just nailed it. It was awesome.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Leia has some printed elements for her belt and she&rsquo;s holding a brick-built blaster. This model is superb. As I noted above the hair buns just work, they are a bit looser due to how they are attached, but they don&rsquo;t fall off or anything, they can just be turned easier. This model looks great, and I am very pleased to have picked it up.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This Star Wars BrickHeadz is one of the best, the technique to make the iconic hairbuns was an aspect of the build that I was extremely impressed by. I really recommend this set for that reason alone, overall you can&rsquo;t go wrong with BrickHeadz. Highly Recommended.</p>
