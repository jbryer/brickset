<p>The end result is an absolute masterpiece of design.&nbsp; Every piece is perfectly placed, every edge and stud and exposed corner&nbsp;factor into the overall whole magnificently.&nbsp; It&#39;s so satisfying.</p>

<p>Plus it looks great, and there are a whole bunch of cool tiny pieces in unusual colors.</p>

<p>All in all, a perfect set for AFOLs.&nbsp; I&#39;d love to know who the designer was... can&#39;t wait to see what else they come up with.</p>

The detail is insane including the dent on his helmet, the rangefinder, the printed belt, the custom EE-3 blaster, and the jetpack is great as well. I highly suggest picking this one up before its gone.&nbsp;</p>
