Compared to years before, this one lacked a certain ingenuity and coherent theme. There were several days that revealed toy planes, helicopters, race cars, drones, etc. This year around there were only a handful of minifigs and they just felt shoehorned in to the rest of the &quot;toy&quot; theme. They didn&#39;t add that much fun and excitement to the overall joy of opening each door. The snowman felt drab and uninspired (I know they have done better in previous years and can&#39;t outright recycle the build of previous years... but come on). The cookie stand felt cheap and crummy (note the wheels are not even wheels)<br />
And then there was the bizarre toys. From the cover of the box, I get that it was likely to resemble Christmas window shopping in Europe. But the fold out play scene was half indoor/half outdoor. It wasn&#39;t as enjoyable as setting the minifigs up on the outdoor half enjoying the holiday japery that previous years had.<br />
Overall, I was unimpressed and regretting my purchase of the City advent calendar this year. The true winner was the Lego Friends calendar! </font></p>

It had a nice selection of mini builds and minifigures. One general suggestion for future advent calendars however is that I&#39;d prefer if the pieces were used to make up one big build over the 24 days rather than a collection of mini builds.</p>
