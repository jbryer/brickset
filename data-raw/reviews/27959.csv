The thematic element of Series 18 was Celebration. Everyone was dressed up in a costume for a party and Elephant Girl is not the only character wearing an animal costume.</p>

<p>With a simple light grey print for her stomach detailing and her toes, the rest is a plain grey colouring including the hands. I had hoped to pick up two of her, but despite Series 18 being around for a while I never did pick one up. With a brand new mouse piece to add to the LEGO animals and with two funny facial expressions, one screaming in fright and one smiling, this Minifigure is a must-have.</p>

<p>These parts were recently re-used for February to make a Pink Elephant Costume. I bring this up now because this Minifigure is not in the database and probably won&#39;t ever be since it is make-your-own-Minifigure.</p>

<p>This offering from Series 18 is a must-have. With the pink tutu on if you got multiples of her you could put on your own show. Highly Recommended. Oh yes, Series 18 also used an orange version of the Minifigure stand. Making this Series stand out when put next to Series 1-17.</p>
