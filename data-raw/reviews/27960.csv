"BuildTheBrick","2018-04-27T19:32:19.367Z","Red Brick Boy.","<p>I feel like the Minifig should have more flow in between the mold and the legs, and keep in mind, the brick is actually the body, and I &nbsp;think that if they cut it and just made it two studs it would be better, also, the way the head sinks in is a little bit of a problem, because&nbsp;if you use a head where the mouth is lower it would be too obvious. The hair is great! I mean when do you get that hair in a set before!</p>

<p><strong>All in all</strong> good minifig, However, you&#39;d think that for the Minifig&nbsp;birthday these collectible&nbsp;minifigs&nbsp;would be half priced ;)</p>

<p>I left the Building experience neutral&nbsp;because it is a minifig</p>

"Fredaholic","2018-04-29T05:06:50.85Z","Stud by Stud","<p>Before I start I want to remind everyone this is the commonest figure in the box along with his female counterpart.However,I seemed to have got a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;more of him and not because I randomly picked or did not feel right.Also,1 blue brick suit girl is what is what I got.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I first saw the pictures for series 18,this figure immediately&nbsp;captured my eyes.It stood out,in a good way.He was a classic.Celebrating 60 years of the brick and 40 years of the minifig,this guy really stands out in a crowd.Although he basically took up two spots with the other brick suit person,this guy is surely one to remember.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first 3 or 4 packs I opened of series 18 dropped out on the counter 1 brick suit guy,with no suprise&nbsp;since he is super commen.I ended up getting like 4 of him and I expect to trade him on &quot;Minifigure&nbsp;Swap Monday&quot; at the lego store.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anyways,enough of my stories,now to the real thing.His smile surely sends positive messages and his hair is surely detailed,like a wave of brown curled onto a head.In his hand is a 1x1 blue brick(his female counterpart has a 1x1 red brick) which I suspect he is giving as a gift to his female identity.Nothing new with the red legs,which seems obvious not to print anything on them.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The torso was suprising,it works exactly like a normal brick.The arms come out of circled rings of the torso,which is a small detail not important or even that much of noticeable at all.And he has some nice red gloves on his supposedly yellow hands.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; How to feel:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; OK,this guy is easy.1.You have a better chance to get him from any old pack for he is really common.2.Feel for the studs and make sure they are on a thick object,very easy step.3.To distinguish male and female is a bit hard.To find out,feel for the hair.If it has a small thing sticking out,it is a ponytail belonging to Mrs.Bricksuit.If it does not have that and has small wrinkles,you got Mr.Bricksuit!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-05-11T01:24:18.043Z","Unique Torso Element","<p><b>Set #71021 Brick Suit Guy:</b>&nbsp;Wearing a LEGO Brick costume, this minifigure is ready to celebrate. A brand new torso element was created with this Series which represents a 2x3 brick with Minifigure arms attached on the side which can hook into LEGO legs of all sizes.</p>

<p>His facial print has a smile, he carries a 1x1 plate in blue and nothing else. At first you might think this is a weak offering, but this Minifigure is unique and the new torso element can be used in many clever ways since you can build on the front, back and bottom while attaching Minifigure heads to the top. Overall he&#39;s a very ingenious looking design.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pretty pleased to see they&#39;ve brought this new piece back for Series 20. However it has yet been included in any official LEGO sets. I&#39;m intrigued enough to say I hope some clever designer can find a use for this. Overall for this Minifigure I&#39;d recommend him. As this is fairly old now you&#39;ll need to purchase it on the secondary market.</p>

<p>Comes in normal CMS bag and has the normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure&nbsp;parts you get a 1x1 blue flat brick.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The figure is pretty simple outside of the brick body. He has normal hair and singled sided head. He has red pants. The brick body is really cool. It is a 2x3&nbsp;brick with arms&nbsp;that you can build on if you want.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Just building a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall it is a good minifigure. The new body is really good. Being able to build on it is really nice as well. The 1x1 blue flat brick was nice. Besides the new brick body their is nothing really special to it, which is why I&#39;m giving it a 4 star rating.&nbsp;</p>
