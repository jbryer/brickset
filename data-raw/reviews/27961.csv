"Brickstarr","2018-04-19T17:11:53.797Z","WHAT ARE YOU BUILDING???","<p>Today&nbsp;I will be reviewing the bricksuit girl (set 71021-3) she comes with 5 pieces and retails for &pound;3 or $4.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;honestly love this minifig ,&nbsp;I just think it&#39;s amazing they make a minifigure a look like she&#39;s a brick. I prefer the boy though because of the hairpiece.</p>

<p>She has blue trousers and the blu brick is slip on. She has a happy, smiling face with pink lipstick and a brown ponytail. She also comes with a red piece to hold.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading</p>

<p>I hope this was helpful :-)</p>

"BuildTheBrick","2018-04-27T19:41:07.83Z","Blue Brick Girl","<p>I feel like the Minifig should have more flow in between the mold and the legs, and keep in mind, the brick is actually the body, and I &nbsp;think that if they cut it and just made it two studs it would be better, also, the way the head sinks in is a little bit of a problem, because&nbsp;if you use a head where the mouth is lower it would be too obvious. The hair is great! I mean when do you get that hair in a set before!</p>

<p><strong>All in </strong><strong>all</strong> good&nbsp;minifig, However, you&#39;d think that for the&nbsp;Minifig&nbsp;birthday these&nbsp;collectible&nbsp;minifigs&nbsp;would be half priced ;)</p>

<p>I left the Building experience neutral&nbsp;because it is a&nbsp;minifig.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-05-11T01:48:00.7Z","Boy meets Girl","<p><b>Set #71021 Brick Suit Girl:</b>&nbsp;This review is going to be rather short I&#39;m afraid. The only difference between her and her male counterpart is the colouring. Naturally her hair piece as well.</p>

<p>Brick Suit Girl is a blue brick with a red 1x1 tile. She and the Brick Suit Boy seem to be complimenting each other and it would appear to be they were meant to complement one another. She looks quite nice and her huge tooth-revealing smile is highly amusing.</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend picking up multiples of her and seeing what you might be able to build using the brand new torso element. Everything about her and her companion the Brick Suit Boy are just really impressive and quite meta. Meaning that these two characters are dressed in LEGO costumes which can mean they really like building with LEGO and the LEGO company and can attach anywhere and everywere to models. Highly Recommended.</p>

"vikings","2020-07-08T04:44:12.183Z","Brick Suit Girl","<p>So this figure is pretty much the same as the Brick Suit Guy (You can check out my review on him). The only difference is the color and that is a girl and not a guy.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a normal CMS bag with normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure parts you get a 1x1 red plate and an orange 2x4 CMS stand. I&#39;m not overly happy with the amount of the pieces, and the quality of the parts you get in this set. I would have liked something more than a special brick body piece. Overall an okay part haul for a CMS figure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Brick Suit Girl:</strong></p>

<p>The brick suit girl is a decent CMS figure. She has a brown hair piece that looks nice. She has a single sided head with a big smile as her facial expression. For her torso she has the new custom 2x3 blue brick body. This is a really cool piece to get. I really like that they made it so you can actually build on either side of the body (not that I would want to or anything, but it is nice to have the option). Lastly you have some plain&nbsp;blue legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a lower end figure from this CMS wave. If you got some better parts in this set it would definitely make it much better than it is. The hair piece is really nice and looks good. The head is pretty simple and getting just plain blue legs (while works for this figure) doesn&#39;t help when the only good part you get is the brick body. I would only recommend this CMS figure if you are trying to collect the wave or are just a fan of the CMS theme. If you aren&#39;t you can definitely pass this figure up. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 3-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Master_Wu","2019-07-17T14:21:13.677Z","Clips to anything!","<p>I really like this minifigure! Her legs are a plain blue and her hair is normal, but that&#39;s not what&#39;s special about her!</p>

<p>This lady&#39;s torso is what&#39;s really cool! she has a 2x6 in front, and the back is just like the backside of any brick! And to all those who are wondering: the torso Is the brick. She also holds a red brick which can be a little tricky to put in her hand. Overall it was worth the money I paid for it!</p>

<p>This minifigure doesn&#39;t have much play value; which is why I would mainly recommend this set&nbsp;to people who like collecting them.</p>
