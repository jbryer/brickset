<p>&nbsp; When series 1 came out,we were introduced to the original circus clown,horn in hand and colorful,with the great red puffy hair and such.Series 5 brought us the small clown with a short hat and pie.We had the sad clown in series 10 and one licensed clown.Now in 2018 we get the 3rd clown of the gang,party clown.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;His double colored&nbsp;hat is alright and I appreciate that they put the flower on the lower side to cover his odd black eyebrows.His face is funny and entertaining with a neck bow tie peice.The bow tie sometimes does not&nbsp;fit to the clown when it is the wrong side.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;With his new balloon molds in hand,this guy is awesome.His great green pants with even some printing,despite not necessary,and the great,long orange vest&nbsp;flapping about.Some purple is shown and his white gloves really add the touch.Overall,this minifigure is really well detailed and entertaining!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Feeling:Oh how easy it was.Just feel for the round hat,very easy.Then find the hat&#39;s bottem overhang and your done!</p>

At least I believe that cloth element was introduced here first, it&#39;s been a while and I&#39;m not 100% sure, but I do know this was my first time with it so if originated on Joker first in the DC line I do apologise for having my facts wrong.</p>

<p>The Party Clown features minimal printing on the legs for his pants, a single sided torso print with orange and purple striped vest a large top hat with a printed flower on one side and a different shade of blueish green on the other, a bow-tie element in red, a goofy printed facial expression with his tongue sticking out and two balloon dogs. One in green and one in pink as his accessories.</p>

<p>Overall I did enjoy this Minifigure when I first got him and feel that he works well for any display, Party themed or Carnival/Circus Themed. I love the introduction of the Balloon Animal pieces, but I feel LEGO hasn&#39;t done much with them or even introduced any new animals in that form since, other commonly seen animals as Balloons include Giraffes, Elephants, Snakes and I seem to recall an incident with a balloon shaped mouse once, though I could be misremembering. I&#39;d love to see LEGO tackle other balloon animals with other types of clowns in future.</p>

<p>I would strongly recommend this Minifigure mostly for the parts, he&#39;s a great addition to any collection or display using the Carnival/Circus/Amusement Park Attraction models that have been used in recent years. Highly Recommended.</p>
