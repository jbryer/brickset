<p>This minifg is easy to feel for in the blind bag, beccause of the big suit.</p>

<p>There are star printings all over the suit and the word bang on the front.</p>

<p>The legs are printed on the front (obviously no printing on the back).</p>

His torso is plain blue with red hands and his legs are gray with a little explosion mark at the top. The&nbsp;rocket piece is pretty cool but overall it is a pretty plain minifig.</p>

<p>I would recommend other minifigures first because the only main thing special about him is the rocket piece.&nbsp;</p>

Fun!","<p><b>Set #71021 Firework Guy:</b>&nbsp;Celebration has included fireworks since they were invented, to celebrate and let the wider area see that you have succeeded in laying siege to the fortress... or something. I&#39;m not a firework historian.</p>

<p>This guy seems to be ready for celebrating everything, unfortunately he can&#39;t explode; with a plain blue torso under a large costume piece printed with little star-shaped explosions and the word BANG on it, and with legs showing a print of the sparkling fire used to launch the rocket below the belt line this shades sporting dude is fairly impressive. While the new costume is something, I do kind of wish they&#39;d included a sparkler piece for him to hold, even if it was the classic Castle era wizard&#39;s wand in a single trans-clear blue, green or pink colour.</p>

<p>I&#39;d still recommend him from the set, but I&#39;d suggest grabbing more of the unique and interesting figures over this plain-jane costume dude. Some of the other characters in costumes are decidedly much better designed. Recommended.</p>
