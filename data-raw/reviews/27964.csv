<p>This Minifigure features some nice torso printing, a bit of limited printing for shoes on the dual-molded legs and a very impressive re-use of a hair sculpt with a hole in the top for accessories in a light brownish orange tone. Included with her is a gift box with printed 1x1 round tile cookies, a 2x2 tile lid printed with a tassel, a light purple party hat and a dark purple balloon. It would appear she likes this colour quite a lot.</p>

<p>Overall I find this Minifigure quite enjoyable, the parts have a lot of re-use ideas and it is very nice to see the new Balloon accessory which is more in scale with Minifigures. I&#39;d definitely recommend tracking a few of these down if you missed out on them. Recommended.</p>
