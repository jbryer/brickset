"Brickstarr","2018-04-19T17:03:40.37Z","RAHHH!!!!","<p>Today&nbsp;I will be reviewing the collectible minifigure Dragon guy (set 71021-7) he has six pieces and he can be bought in a collectible packet with cost &pound;3 or&nbsp;$4.</p>

<p>i don&#39;t really know why they put&nbsp;a dragon into this series as&nbsp;I thought it was meant to be birthday themed but&nbsp;I guess I&#39;ll never know.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His trousers are red and at the bottom he has some printing that looks like black claws. He has a tail which you put on the legs before the torso. It&#39;s red also with black spikes.his torso is red with&nbsp;an orange chest and black markings on the corners of the chest and arms. He then has&nbsp;some red wings and a double sided head. On his head is a happy expression and an angry one. His helmet is really cool and you have to&nbsp;put&nbsp;2 pieces in the back.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading</p>

<p>I hope this was helpful :-)</p>

<h2>Pros</h2>

<p>&raquo; Highly detailed minifigure.</p>

<p>&raquo; The head of the dragon costume is incredible.</p>

<p>&raquo; Detailed tail.</p>

<p>&raquo; Double face.</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<p>&raquo; The wing of the dragon suit has no details.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p>This minifigure is one of the best of this series because it has several details by the dragon costume and double face. But in my opinion it lacked details in the wings.<br />
I recommend buying this series of collectable minifigures&nbsp;and recommend to anyone who does not want to spend money to find this minifigure in a random bag I&nbsp;recommend buying this minifigure on ebay&nbsp;or in bricklink.</p>

Granted he probably isn&#39;t meant to be Smaug, but the colouring and design on him is definitely close to the famed dragon from The Hobbit. He even matches the look of the animal from The Lonely Mountain set.</p>

<p>Possessing a unique head piece and tail piece to attach to the legs, this costumed party goer includes the Gargoyle wings from Series 14 in red, a very nicely detailed torso with arm printing showing off scales and a single sided torso with more scales. He has no accessories, limited foot printing and two unique facial expressions, one side smiling the other roaring in imitation of a dragon.</p>

<p>Overall this is a really solid addition to the CMF line and I really enjoyed getting one. I&#39;d strongly recommend this one as one of the best in the line.</p>

"vikings","2020-07-07T06:30:03.857Z","One of the Best CMS Figures from this Wave!","<p>In my opinion, this is the second best CMS figure in this wave behind the Classic Police Officer. The parts and detail on it make this such a high quality CMS figure in this wave.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a normal CMS bag with normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You only get one part besides the minifigure parts, an orange 2x4 CMS stand (I liked getting a different color stand). Other than that it is the only piece that isn&#39;t a minifigure part. Overall (including minifigure parts) you get some really good parts in this set. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dragon Suit Guy:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This is the second best figure you can get in this CMS wave (Behind the Classic Police Officer). The Dragon head is amazing. The black printing of the dragon scales look amazing and the two small black spikes as horns really compliment it. The open mouth showing the teeth (and the guys head) really look great. The guy has a double-sided head. On one side he has an angry facial expression with some freckles. On the other side he is smiling with again some freckles. You get a set of red dragons. You don&#39;t have any printing. I do wish you got some sort of black printing on it so it would match the rest of the figure. He has printing on one side of his torso and on parts of his arms. On the front of the torso you have a yellow-orange front armor scale with a few patches of black scales. On the back it is just plain red torso. On the shoulders of the arms you a patch of black scales which is really nice to get. You get the dragon tail with black spikes coming up along the entire tail. The legs only have&nbsp;printing of six claws (three on each foot) as the only printing on the legs. The figure comes with no weapon or accessory.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is the second best CMS figure in this wave. The parts you get such as the wings, tail, and head of the dragon are amazing to get and add great detail to this figure. The printing on all the parts is great and black works really well with the red. I would have liked some sort of weapon of accessory of some kind (but it is still an amazing CMS figure without any). I highly recommend this CMS to any Lego fan/collector as it will make a great addition to anyones Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"LegoHobbitFan","2018-12-07T21:38:20.427Z","A Delightful Dragon","<p>The dragon suit guy is available in the 18th series of Collectable Minifigures, which are currently available for $3.99. My advice for finding him is to look for the helmet as that is the most distinguishable element.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Helmet and head: his helmet is a unique mold which is very detailed, and has holes on the back for the included horns to slide into, although you could fit many other accesories in as well. The head is double-sided, you can either make him happy or angry.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Torso and legs: the torso is decorates with some&nbsp;big yellowish-orange scales surrounded by some smaller black scales. There are also some black scales on the arms. His feet are red with some claws printed onto the foot.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Wings, tail, and baseplate: he also comes with some red wings which can be slipped around his neck. They lack printing but have detailed molding. His tail, which slips inbetween his legs and torso sticks out about 2 bricks behind him, so you&#39;ll have to keep him 2 studs away from a wall unless you remove it. It is very detailed with some black spikes sticking out of the top though. He also comes with the typical 3x4 minifigure baseplate, but in orange.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Play: I have found him not the most useful for playing with as a guy in a dragon suit is not the most helpful character. That is not to say that he can not be played with however, just not to the degree of some other Minifigures.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Display: on the other hand, he is excellent for display! In fact, he is one of the most detailed CMF Minifigures I can think of!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Price/summary: with this figure, it all depends on what you want him for. If you are looking for play there are some other figures I would recommend first. For display however I would highly recommend forking over the $4 necessary to buy&nbsp;him. I hope you find this review helpful!</p>

"TheRightP_art","2020-01-22T23:01:00.157Z","Flaming Hot Doritos","<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p>

<p>I had just recently acquired this set from a local road-side shop for about 6USD, and I couldn&#39;t have been happier. This minifig is immaculate. From the intricately moulded headpiece to the side arm-prints, he is a wonder!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Design: 5/5</strong></p>

<p>Celebrating the 40th anniversary of the LEGO minifigure warrants it to pay homage and the Dragon Suit Guy does not disappoint. His design pays tribute to the Fantasy era Dragon - a creature I always wanted as a kid but never got. The wings are an inspired&nbsp;reuse, and the tail is spot-on. I might complain about the head being a bit too tall and wide, but that is a necessary compromise for it to fit on top of a minifigure head.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts: 4/5</strong></p>

<p>The head, body, and tail are perfect. However, dual moulding on the wings would have been preferred to better emulate the two-tone wing design of the Fantasy era Dragon. The legs could also be improved with some printing of scales. Another down-side is that the parts aren&#39;t all that useful outside of the setting. Needless to say, what is given is, for the most part, fantastic.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability: 5/5</strong></p>

<p>Hell yeah! I love swooshing this thing around (and I am a mature man!).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money: 5/5</strong></p>

<p>Considering all the new moulds, I&#39;d consider this good value if you acquired it for less than 7USD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>One of the BEST collectable minifigures. Get it before it&#39;s too late and Series 18 becomes the new Series 1.</p>
