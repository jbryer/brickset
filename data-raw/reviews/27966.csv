<p>Yesterday I visited the Lego&nbsp;shop in Leicester Square hoping to get my hands on this apparently rare mini figure,</p>

<p>And I asked a wonderful shop assistant called Andrea, who helped me and my children search out this figure&nbsp; she was so helpful&nbsp; and yes I now have the collectable mini figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An amazing little figure with a throw back to the past&nbsp; makes me smile&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Five stars to TLG for this one&nbsp;</p>

This is an homage to the first modern minifigure ever made by Lego all the way back in 1978. There&#39;s only 1 per each box of Series 18 blind bags, while most figures have about 4 per box, so you&#39;d want to feel up packets on the left side if you do happen upon a box of this series. The figure itself is simple, but since it is an homage to the first modern minifig, that&#39;s intentional. Its accessory is a little &quot;box&quot; of the set it was included in. All in all, this is a nice rare novelty that you&#39;ll want to get your hands on, because the price of this is only going to rise on the second hand market in due time. 5/5 for the novelty.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-07-31T20:33:30.03Z","Rare Find","<p><b>Set #71021 Classic Police Officer:</b>&nbsp;Series 18 included a bonus 1 per case Minifigure that you needed to get in order to have a full set. This made&nbsp;this particular Minifigure rather difficult to find unless you were exceptionally proficient with the feel method and could find his unique cap.</p>

<p>This minifigure is inspired by the Minifigure found in set 600 Police Car from Classic LEGO Town. The print is reproduced on the torso which used to be represented by a sticker if I&#39;m not mistaken, the face is printed as well the same standard LEGO yellow Minifigure expression. Included is a pair of tiles that combine to form a miniature box of the LEGO Police Car set #600 which is a unique printed tile. Very impressive.</p>

<p>I was astounded I managed to find this Minifigure and quite pleased. If you are a fan of classic minifigure designs and classic minifigure looks you&#39;ll want to track this down on the secondary market. Highly Recommended.</p>

"Minifig290","2018-07-28T01:34:41.667Z","Great figure, worth a 1/60 though?","<p>Hiya all how you doing, today i&rsquo;m looking at the rare Classic Police Officer collectible minifigure&nbsp;to&nbsp;Series 18 that retailed for &pound;3 or $4. This figure is one&nbsp;of&nbsp;17 to collect but is the most desirable from collectors due to 2 factors it&rsquo;s retro 1978 feel and it exclusivity of 1 per 60 pack box.</p>

<p>The price per part on this guy is 42p/57c (including baseplate). Sadly this figure is a pain to find and to get cheap online costing on average around &pound;15-&pound;30 ($17-$35), enough rambling let&rsquo;s get to the review :)</p>

<p><b>Minifigure</b></p>

<p>Of the 7 parts 4 go into this extremely basic figure he has a plain pair of black legs, classic 1978 smile and a unprinted white cap, but the exclusive part is his torso with 5 white buttons and a small basic police logo printed onto the front. As this is meant to represent the first minifigure ever there aren&rsquo;t any double moulded, and other prints or odd&nbsp;elements.</p>

<p><strong>Accessory</strong></p>

<p>The polices accessory aren&rsquo;t the expected handcuffs it&rsquo;s a exclusive 1x2 printed tile ( representing the first set that had a figure Set 600 Police Car released in 1978) on a yellow 1x2 yellow plate, also a orange minifigure baseplate&nbsp;exclusive to the series.</p>

<p>______________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To finish out my review of the Classic Police Officer CMF i&rsquo;d just want to ask why is it a 1/60 distribution whereas others have a 3/60 to 5/60 distribution. Now i&rsquo;ve collected 3 of these thankfully so a tip to get one</p>

<p>1. Find a full box of 60 and go to the far left row and it&rsquo;s the fifth pack to back.</p>

<p>2. Feel for the 1x2 tile and pale as no other figures have this part from the series</p>

<p>3. Don&rsquo;t instantly resort to Ebay or Bricklink if you wait you might be lucky to find one at a shop someday in the near future</p>

<p>Back to the conclusion i love the detail to the 1x2 tile of the old 600 set and the orange baseplate&nbsp;is a guaranteed bonus with all 17 in the series, Good job LEGO</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Great exclusive 1x2 detailed tile, Retro 1978 feel, Simplistic figure but done right</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>Limited figure, ridiculous Ebay prices&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
