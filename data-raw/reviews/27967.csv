One of them is this spider suit boy, which comes in the most recent serie of the collectible minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This figure suffers from one big problem: rubber molds. while rubber molds are good to customize, they should be used on things like neck brackets. Because this has a rubber mold for the spider on the back, it doesnt look like it &quot;sticks&quot; to the torso, and it looks bad from the side.</p>

<p>The torso has an amazing spider-hoodie. Thanks to the spider you cant see it, but his torso also has back printing. Its just a regular hoodie backprinting, but atleast its something.</p>

<p>This minifigure also has a double sided face, a bored one and a scared (i think) one. I personally really like this. They did this with some other figures in this serie&nbsp;and while it isnt something they had to do, they still did it and i like that.</p>

<p>Personally, i really like this figure, but it has its flaws. i think they should&#39;ve made a new mold for a spider web like&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6006221/spiders-web-w-shaft-%C3%B8-3-2"">6006221 Spider Web</a>&nbsp;but smaller, with a stud on it, so the small spider could stand on that. Nonetheless, its a great figure.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Dressed in a hoodie with zipper showing, this character includes an older LEGO spider element for an accessory to hold. He includes two expressions, fearful/goofy smirk/grin and a more neutral expression. Perhaps suffering from Arachnophobia, he has chosen to dress up as his least favorite thing, only to discover his fake plastic spider is a real spider, hence the sudden nervousness.</p>

<p>This Minifigure is a really impressive one, monochromatic almost entirely with white, grey and black as the primary colour choices. Overall I&#39;d recommend picking up a few, the parts alone are very creative and could be used in any number of fun, clever ways. To date LEGO has yet to re-use this back bracket element, I am anticipating something highly impressive when they do. Perhaps a Black Widow Girl? Highly Recommended.</p>
