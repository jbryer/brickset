<p>Lego has put a lot of party/birthday themed minifigs into series 18 because they&#39;re celebrating 40 years of LEGO minifigs.</p>

<p>I love the birthday cake guy with has excited face and golden bow tie and I&#39;ll give some more features&nbsp;I love.</p>

<p>Without his cake on his trousers are pink with blue markings on his torso is then a blue suit with pink markings and to finish of a golden bow tie.he has a excited face (I love this) a black hair piece which&nbsp;I think I&#39;ll use on some other minifigs and finally to keep u the party theme a gold party hat. his cake is one piece and the minifig can stand in it. it&#39;s pink with white icing and a blue bow. It also comes with an orange stand.</p>

<p>This partygoer consists of a Minifigure inside a brand new Birthday Cake element. Decorated with frosting using dual-molding techniques to make a pink and white cake, this blue ribbon is printed onto the element. The slot in the top can fit a Minifigure, or if you&#39;re being creative, can fit any 1x2 bricks to make a matching topper for a cake display item in your MOC LEGO world.</p>

<p>The minfigure is splatter with pink frosting on his light blue shirt, has a golden bow tie to match the pearl gold party hat attached to his hair and carries no accessories. He has a wide smiling expression and a plain dark black bowl cut with hole in the top to slot the hat into.The legs have some blue printing to indicate possibly the batter, but other than that they are completely pink.</p>

<p>I find this one is a very impressive looking figure, despite being slightly limited in display options, the parts alone are well worth tracking this little fellow down. Recommended Highly.</p>

<p>I think that this Minifigure is absolutely excellent! The printing on the legs and torso is great, giving the look of someone who just jumped into a cake! The color choice of light blue also contrasts very well with the pink frosting! As for the rest of the Minifig, the face is absolutely adorable, and I very much enjoy the fact that the hair has a small hole in it for a golden party hat. He even has a little yellow bow tie with jack-o&#39;-lanterns printed on his torso!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The total amount of parts in the set (including the Minifigure) is seven. Aside from the Minifigure though, there is also an orange stand for display and a rare cake piece, which can actually fit a Minifig in it!!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned in section one, this CMF (Collectable Minifigure) is absolutely excellent! Therefore, I recommend it and I give it an overall five-star rating!</p>

<p><strong>Thank you for reading my (first Brickset) review and I hope this was helpful!</strong></p>
