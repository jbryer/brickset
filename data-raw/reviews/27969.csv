"Brickking6077","2020-05-11T21:04:41.803Z","Is this right out of the Old West?","<p>When I first saw this minifigure in the lineup, I jumped! I could not believe that TLG was going to produce a true icon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, I still have my doubts as to the costumed figure. The lack of leg printing may disappoint some, but I found it acceptable. Likewise, I think an accessory of some kind should have been included. Thankfully, the other features far outweigh any disadvantages.</p>

<p>I absolutely love the cactus piece worn over the figure. I feel as though it has just the right amount of thorns. The arms are quite unique and I like to rotate these into every possible direction to replicate the cactus this is based off of, the&nbsp;Saguaro. This cactus is restricted to the Sonoran Desert in Arizona, USA. I actually grew up here and can firmly say that this cactus is authentic.</p>

<p>The torso is a new jumper component and looks just as uncomfortable as any woollen garment. Lastly, the head is double sided with a serene expression on one side and a wonderfully humorous, uncomfortable one on the other.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am definitely glad that I procured this figure and hope that others can get as much enjoyment out of it as I did.&nbsp;</p>

Her costume is a single piece the slides over torso and legs and covered in raised bumps to represent the spines of the cactus.</p>

<p>Her arms are unique and do not feature any hands. They are angled permanently bent, so the re-use here is a bit uncertain. Her torso beneath the costume is printed with a green striped sweater pattern mimicking the look of a cactus. Her face includes a smiling expression and an &#39;ouch I just poked myself with a spine&#39; expression. No accessories included, not even a scorpion to sit next to her as if she were in the desert.</p>

<p>Overall this is a fairly fun looking figure and decidedly impressive for what it is. There is unfortunately not much you can use the parts for in MOC figures. That being said I&#39;d still recommend a few, they&#39;d make excellent set pieces for a stage show production set in the old west. Recommended.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The minifigure is a costume&nbsp;of course; that&#39;s sort of the main theme of this series. The costume is of a Saguaro (Sah - war - oh) cactus, which seems to have become the stereotypical cactus, even though in only grows in southern Arizona and a bit of southeastern California in the USA, and most of Baja California, the northwest of Sonora, and Baja California Sur in Mexico. Or really, it only grows in the Sonoran Desert. You don&#39;t need to know that, but now you do.</p>

<p>Back to the actual minifigure, the cactus is very well done, perfectly portraying the cylindrical spikiness of the Saguaro cactus. The arms also work very well, and yes, when turning them upside down it does go up a bit in a way that does seem awkward, but I can&#39;t see how that could be avoided.</p>

<p>There is printing on the torso, which is basically a&nbsp;continuation of the vertical lines of a cactus, just on a sort of shirt or sweater or something that is underneath the main cactus, which is a nice bit.</p>

<p>The face is double-sided, with the&nbsp;calm expression you can see in the main set photo on one side, and an uncomfortable or itchy face on the other, which I think is very good for the character, personally.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>There is nothing, because the minifigure cannot hold anything. There is the orange stand, which is nice, but nothing else, which is a bit disappointing.</p>

<p><strong><em>El fin</em></strong></p>

<p>So yes, I am a *bit* biased about this character, so let&#39;s look at this for someone who isn&#39;t really into Saguaros. It doesn&#39;t offer much as a figure; It&#39;s just a person dressed up as a cactus. It&#39;s not super useful outside it being a cactus. Maybe the face is nice, and it is, but that&#39;s just one thing. Besides that, it&#39;s just a cactus. It&#39;s not really a must-have. It&#39;s good for what it is, but it&#39;s not useful outside of displaying it in your CMF collection or your cactus collection, so it&#39;s not super great for someone where that isn&#39;t important to them.</p>

<p>I give it 3.75 stars, but I am forced to round.</p>
