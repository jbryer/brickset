Once I've done at least five different modifications on the jeep, including a closed chassis, heightened frame and carriage, moveable hood with a V engine inside, for these last two I had to completely redesign the front of the car. At the end, it was looking like a Hummer :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sabpol","2007-10-31T22:30:17.513Z","One of my top favorites","I am so glad I bought this LEGO jeep back in the early 90's. It has working steering and realistic details like a stick-shifter, side-view mirrors, tools (including a Fabuland shovel - how funny!), and a winch with hook. <br/><br/>It has rather basic pieces such as plates, and not really any specialized pieces like many sets have today. Yet it all comes together to build a realistic, proportional Jeep that looks like the real thing. ",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"hustla187","2009-01-22T20:20:36.84Z","Just a Great Set","Model Team was in its first year of sets and if you had one of those sets, it would probably be this one. The jeep model is very, very cool and has some great features from the steering wheel to the spare tire mounted on the back of the jeep. The tow truck is also a pretty cool model too. The crane is awesome and could tow the jeep if it breaks down. This Model Team set is amazing and it is perfect as it is.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"J__B_","2010-07-10T09:17:37.42Z","Great possibilities...","There are many great possibilities for this set...I made it into a pickup truck by simply extending the back of the 4x4 offroader.<br><br>I got this set at a garage sale for $3, and it was (obviously) quite worth the money. I would've put this set at $19.99 MSRP. I'm not sure what the original price was, but that's my guess.<br><br>The window is awesome, rarely seen that large in such a small set.<br><br>I would've put the headlights 4 studs apart, instead of 2, but other than that, it's a great model.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"James83","2012-07-13T08:39:33.187Z","The Definitive Model Team Set","<p>I remember my dad getting this for me in a&nbsp;sale for my birthday. I would rate this among my favourite sets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Set</strong></p><p>The Jeep was just perfect, great detailing and it looked the part with lots of nice touches like the windscreen wipers, winch and tow rope, wing mirrors, the Fabuland spade and the spare tyre. Also, perhaps by coincidence, a Lego Technic figure actually fits quite well on the seat and is quite well proportioned to the whole vehicle. The steering worked well and the construction of the Jeep was very sturdy too.</p><p>The crane truck was interesting to build too, and again it looked wonderful. I loved the way the Model Team sets combined the technical elements of Technic, such as steering, with a level of detail found in model sets. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Personal Development</strong></p><p>The Jeep was an excellent base model to modify, I eventually rebuilt it into a Land Rover-type vehicle with an enclosed back with bench seat, roof and a bonnet with an engine inside. I had hours of fun with that Jeep. Plus if you did break the set down you had some useful sloped roofing tiles for thatched roofs and an excellent crane for your Technic creations.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"FlyBy","2012-01-12T17:44:48.283Z","Excellent Set","Considering the year that this was released, this is an amazing set.&nbsp; Given that there are so few specialty pieces, this model comes together to produce a classic vehicle no one can forget.&nbsp; Sadly, after years of being taken apart and put back together, the stickers didn't hold up.&nbsp; The stickers that mimic the number plates were applied over a couple pieces that were tough to keep together when disassembled, but luckily, even without them it looks complete.<br><br>It's a nice set to set up on a shelf along with my Beetle and Volkswagen Camper Van<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Count_Tofu","2015-03-04T17:24:58.227Z","Awesome Jeep, even with it's flaws","<p>One of the best LEGO sets I&#39;ve owned as a kid.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I remember my set had an extra page in the instructions&nbsp;of an adjustment to the steering parts. As a kid this confused me, but the adjustments was very necessary.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Some great parts such as the winch and&nbsp;the huge windscreen. However the stickers were a problem -&nbsp;too many stickers spread out over multiple parts. They will not last.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not to difficult for my 11 year old self. But only in the end I read the adjustment sheet for the steering part which meant I had to redo part of the model. This I did not like very much.</p>

<p>While I loved the Jeep model, I don&#39;t like the secondary model very much. The Jeep is awesome, the tow&nbsp;truck I just find ugly.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I loved it. What I like most is that it is, unlike the more open&nbsp;Technic models, a &#39;real looking&#39; car. I must have made adjustments and changes hundreds of times, it is such a good base model to change and adjust after your own taste.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite some lesser&nbsp;details (stickers, secondary model), this set is five stars for me simply for it&#39;s beauty and&nbsp;playability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
