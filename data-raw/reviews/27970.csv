In light teal this unique element is a fun accessory only for her. She includes dual-molded legs with printing to indicate the fur line between knee and paw/foot, a single sided torso with fur collar and pet collar, and dual-molded arms, with matching fur print just above the bicep.</p>

<p>Also dressed in a matching helmet accessory cleverly designed and detailed, underneath you&#39;ll find some whiskers, a cute little feline nose detail and a smiling expression with silver mascara over the eyelids. Perhaps she&#39;s ready to join the cast of Cats. She includes a tail of course and that&#39;s it.</p>

<p>Overall as a huge fan of cats, the detailing on this costume is exquisite. Though not perfect, the arm printing is only on the side not all around where the two colours used in the molding process meet, which makes for an odd look. Still, I&#39;d recommend her if only because she&#39;d make an excellent henchwoman for 1960s Catwoman. Recommended.</p>
