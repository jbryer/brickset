<p>The car is attached to some wheels and an engine on the back and&nbsp;sits on the minifigure&#39;s legs.&nbsp;The torso keeps it in place. The minifigure&#39;s legs have&nbsp;very good detailing on both&nbsp;the front AND sides! There are even logos written all over this guy! the torso has similar detail to the legs in front, but his arms have nice stripes going down the sleeves. Even the drivers helmet has&nbsp;very nice stripes and colors!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although this minifigure doesn&#39;t have much play value, he is a great collectable which I recommend to any lego fan! This set was well worth the price!</p>

<p>Race&nbsp;car driver is unfortunately the only series 18 figure I got but I still believe it is the best of the series .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The helmet is in the blue colour and has very nice side printing , the visor is just in the smoky black transparent colour , his head has a happy expression and has sideburns , the torso has a racing suit with printing on both sides , his waist attachment is a car in red which is very nice and drives very well as it uses the skateboard wheels along with a 1&times;1 silver printed tile , his legs are very nicely printed with side printing along with the side arm printing .</p>

<p>The stand-</p>

<p>&nbsp;The stand is the standard orange CMF stand from series 18 . In conclusion this is a very playable minifigure who is very detailed and I would recommend it .&nbsp;</p>

Vroooom!","<p><b>Set #71021 Race Car Guy:</b>&nbsp;This clever fellow has dressed himself in racing fatigues and then taken one of those kiddie cars and slipped it over his torso. At least it might be a fully functional kiddie car toy, consider LEGO added real working wheels and a nice bit of printed detailing to the front hood.</p>

<p>Sponsored by RR, Clutch Drive, Cross Axle and Grand Brix, this Minifigure has loaded detailing all over his arms, legs, back and chest. His belt even has R. Racer printed on it, meaning this guy&#39;s name could be Rex Racer... Ooooo, clever, he&#39;s dressed up as Speed Racer. Er, I mean a member of his family, oh I forget. The point is he&#39;s got a ton of detailing and that doesn&#39;t even include the printed pattern of his racing jumpsuit. Or the detail on his helmet sides. He also sports some nice side burns.</p>

<p>The car portion of the costume can roll and fits between the legs and torso, it&#39;s printed with the number 40, some headlights and a nice window and stripe pattern on the front. The back fits a small 1x1 half round tile with gas pedal printing commonly found on motorcycles.</p>

<p>Overall this is a brilliant looking figure and one of the highlights of Series 18, I&#39;d strongly recommend trying to track one down as his parts are very versatile and useful. Here&#39;s hoping LEGO re-uses the car piece in different colours in future. Strongly Recommended.</p>
