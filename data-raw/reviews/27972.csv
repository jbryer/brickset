<p>Her torso features a bit of stem printing for the bulb which sits around her face as the head piece. This is in the shape of a daisy perhaps, I&#39;m not 100% up on flower types, but it&#39;s a rich magenta in colour and looks very impressive. She includes two expressions, a smiling one and a nervous looking one. Or perhaps she&#39;s about to sneeze. Either way, she probably doesn&#39;t want to be next to any Bumblebee Girls.</p>

<p>Overall this is another fun and unique offering from this Series. I would recommend it for the parts alone, but she makes a fine addition to any Minifigure plant costume collection. Recommended.</p>
