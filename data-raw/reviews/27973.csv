<p>His legs are plain brown with little hoof printings at the tows to act like the horse&#39;s legs. the horses tail rests on the legs as the torso keeps it in place. Main part of the horse looks really nice! There isn&#39;t much detail but it looks perfect! The torso has some rather odd colors which I&#39;m not a big fan of but&nbsp;the horse mostly covers that up!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would recommend this set for almost any lego fan mainly for the horse!</p>

Git'along Little Horsie!","<p><b>Set #71021 Cowboy Costume Guy:</b>&nbsp;Dressed in a classic top with tassels Hollywood made famous as &#39;authentic&#39; cowboy duds, this here&nbsp;party guest is sporting two new pieces, the front end of a horse on a neck bracket which fits over the neck and a horses tail which slides over the waist connection posts for the legs. I believe that second piece is a re-use from Unicorn Girl though, this time it&#39;s in brown, so it&#39;s still a new colour.</p>

<p>He carries no accessories, a rather odd trait amongst most of these party guests, but I suppose it is to be expected with so many new elements included. Sporting a large brimmed tan cowboy hat and plain brown legs with no printing, this Minfigure is an excellent addition from Series 18. I&#39;d recommend him as a must own figure, the parts are great fun, and I really hope LEGO re-uses them at some point in traditional black or white LEGO horse colours. Recommended.</p>
