"Brickstarr","2018-04-21T09:25:34.967Z","LETS GET THIS PARTY STARTED!!!","<p>Today I will be reviewing the LEGO collectible minifigure Birthday party boy&nbsp;(set 71021-16) he comes with 9 pieces and retails for &pound;3 or $4.</p>

<p>Let me just say this is my favorite LEGO minifig in series 18. I just love how cool he looks and his hair looks a bit like mine, but now I&#39;ll get into the review...</p>

<p>His shorts are black then you see a bit of skin and&nbsp;also trainers. He has a blue and white spotted shirt and a blue and red striped tie. His face is kind and smiling and he has some cool green glasses. He has some cool spiked up blond hair and a light brown-dark blond hat on. He is holding a piece that looks like a LEGO minifig packet an orange balloon that is one piece and his present is red with blue wrapping and some red and white decoration on top.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading</p>

<p>I hope it was helpful :-)</p>

<p>This figure is &pound;2.99 or $3.99 giving him a 29p/39c price per part counting the baseplate,&nbsp;he is packed in a foil bag to surprise you when opening the packet.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The figure only uses 4 parts as usual but all the parts are so generic there useful, his hair price is a great new mild in a nice bright blond colour his face has a innocent young expression with a pair of green glasses.</p>

<p>His torso has a nice spotted print with a stripy orange and blue tie while his legs are duel moulded&nbsp;in a dark blue and yellow.</p>

<p><b>Accessories</b></p>

<p>Now what makes the figure for me is his awesome exclusive accessories, he has a new balloon piece that has a orange balloon and white ribbon which is similar to the party girls purple white balloon from this series.<strong>???????</strong></p>

<p>Also he has a new for the series present piece in Red with a blue ribbon that continues onto the white lid inside the present are the best things ever two 1x1 printed series one minifigure&nbsp;packets that have 3 of the 16 figures the ninja, american woman and an other who i can&rsquo;t remember :(.</p>

<p>Oh and a additional mention is for the orange minifigures baseplate which all 17 figures in the series have.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To conclude this review of a awesome figure i&rsquo;d have to say go and buy one of these now before they get a silly high eBay price.</p>

<p>He has multiply great pieces and prints and hopefully the minifigure&nbsp;packet tiles are redone for other series in the future.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>New and exclusive prints and moulds, two 1x1 printed minifigure&nbsp;packets, easy to acquire</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>None to mention</p>

Dressed in a festive polka dot top with pink and blue striped tie, this boy comes with a large boxed present and an orange balloon. Two printed tiles are included with him revealing some Meta Level fan service. This child is bringing LEGO Minifigures Series 1 to the party as a gift.</p>

<p>He has dual-molding for his arms and legs with a curled blonde hair piece and some nice glasses. Many US fans might liken him to a dressed up version of Dennis the Menace, only that character didn&#39;t wear glasses. Overall he&#39;s a solid offering from the Series and features some very nice parts. Now we just need a creepy looking clown Minifigure and the balloon in red.<br />
<br />
Highly Recommended.</p>
