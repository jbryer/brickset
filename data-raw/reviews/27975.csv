<p>Re-using all of the unique elements from Unicorn Girl, Unicorn Guy is a powder baby blue colour with a limited amount of printing on his feet and torso for minor detailing. He has a crown symbol on his chest and some hooves printed on his feet as part of the costume. He carries a pearl gold sword into battle and a printed shield element with a rearing unicorn in a field of vines. Really quite showy actually.</p>

<p>With his winking expression and his colours I&#39;d say this is a very fun Minifigure to own, but I&#39;m still stuck wondering, is he a Unicorn Knight or a Knight posing as a Unicorn for some Masquerade? Overall I&#39;d still recommend him for your collection. Recommended.</p>
