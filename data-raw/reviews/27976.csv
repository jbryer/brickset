It has been 40 years since the release of the minifigure as we know it, and LEGO has decided to run with a &ldquo;theme&rdquo; of sorts to celebrate this milestone. First of all, for the first time ever we have an odd number of minifigures, which on it&rsquo;s&nbsp;own sets this series apart from the rest.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And to celebrate 40 years of minifigures, LEGO has decided upon a costume party theme, with the&nbsp;Classic Police Officer as&nbsp;the guest of honor. First of all, there are 13&nbsp;minifigures&nbsp;who appear wearing a costume. This is also quite a change, as there is usually only 1 or 2 minifigures who&nbsp;get&nbsp;to don a costume. This kind of takes the collectibility away from the costumed characters, but LEGO more than makes up for this by only putting 1 Classic Police Officer per case of 60 (another first for the minifigure series).&nbsp;This definitely makes him the &ldquo;chase&rdquo; minifigure. However this can be seen as a positive or negative thing. AFOL&rsquo;s are very divided on this, and rightly so, as many scalpers are raiding cases for him, so they can be sold for a tidy profit on various sale sites. However, because of the plain, classic look of the Police Officer, he is usually the least desirable for children, and it seems to be a minifigure&nbsp;for AFOL&rsquo;s who like a bit of nostalgia. So maybe it is not so bad that he is a little harder to find.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The costumed minifigures&nbsp;are a little hit and miss in my opinion. The Elephant Girl stands out as a front runner, and the new mouse accessory is definitely a winner for me. We also have a Brick Suit Guy and Girl, who look fantastic, and can actually be connected to each other. We&nbsp;then&nbsp;have the Party Clown. There have been a few Clowns released previously, but the balloon animal accessories are the winners with this one. One of the weaker additions to this series in my opinion is the Fireworks Guy. He has no accessories, and really can&rsquo;t be used in any Moc&rsquo;s as there is no real theme that suits him. The Birthday Party Boy and Girl are also front runners for me, they both have a new balloon accessory and a new present accessory where the box can be sealed. The present with the boy is very good, he is sporting a Series 1 Minifigure&nbsp;Blind Bag. The girl not so much, as she brings donuts, which we have seen in The Simpson&rsquo;s sets. I also really like the Cactus Girl, but I seem to be the minority there, she has been given mostly negative feedback. The Dragon Suit Guy is another throwback, and looks really cool on his own. Spider Suit Boy is kind of bland. I don&rsquo;t get why a spider would have another spider as an accessory. And the suit for him doesn&rsquo;t quite sit flush and looks a little off. I like the Birthday Cake Guy, who has a great cake accessory, and has pink frosting all over his suit which is a nice touch. The Cat Costume Girl is the weakest in the series in my opinion. The thing that really puts me off for her is the odd shape of the mask, and the fact that she has a nose printed on her face. It&rsquo;s just really off putting for me. The Race Car Guy is a throwback to Rocket Racer, with a very nice print and logos on his suit. Now the Flower Pot Girl. This one just looks like a last minute addition. The mask looks OK, but overall she looks out of place and probably very uncomfortable in her very restrictive costume. The Cowboy Costume Guy is also a miss for me. The costume is supposed to look like the legs of the minifigure are the back legs of the horse, but this just doesn&rsquo;t seem to translate well. And finally the Unicorn Guy. Being the counterpart to the Unicorn Girl from Series 13 is pretty cool, as she was one of the most desirable from that series. But I feel like he would have been better received in another series. And I don&rsquo;t get why he has a sword and shield. And I will mention the color of&nbsp;the baseplates. I hate them. The color is the same orange as the brick separators, and when displayed with all the other series it makes it stand out in a bad way. I&rsquo;m not sure why this was done, and this just doesn&rsquo;t seem to be mentioned at all in all the reviews I have read. I have swapped them out for the black baseplates&nbsp;just to calm my OCD.</p>

<p>Overall a less than&nbsp;average series in my opinion. Not as bad as The Simpson&rsquo;s or Ninjago themed series, but definitely worse than the LEGO Batman Movie series and almost all the standard series are better too. I feel this will be a lot more popular with children than AFOL&rsquo;s. Let&rsquo;s say 2/5 studs.</p>
