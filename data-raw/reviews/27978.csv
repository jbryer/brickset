This one is built similarly to the Milano Polybag from the previous year, but this ship uses different parts to make a slightly different looking vessel. For one thing it isn&rsquo;t as large as the Milano, this one is more streamlined.</span></span></span></span></p>

"miuboy","2018-05-29T13:15:24.073Z","the un-named guardians ship","<p>i was walking around my local Walmart&nbsp;when i see a big&nbsp;box of polybags, inside was the following &quot;the royal talon fighter polybag,a city polybag which i forgot the name... and the guardians ship...</p>

<p>OVERVIEW OF BAG</p>

<p>the standard material&nbsp;for polybags&nbsp;and the print on the bag is great... not much to say</p>

<p>BUILDING THE SET</p>

<p>well this set has some weird building techniques, it was easy to build but all polybags&nbsp;are like that.</p>

<p>PARTS</p>

<p>holycrap this set has some colors that i have never seen before, the sandblue&nbsp;tiles and 4*2 wing parts are cool and the odd ball joint with 3 connectors&nbsp;is great to get, the cockpits glass it truly clear compared to most, and alot&nbsp;of transparent purple studs.</p>

<p>THE BUILD</p>

<p>this set has one of the biggest in its class, it is a little smaller than my hit ands but not much smaller, has a feature where you can remove the pod in the back similar to the big version</p>

<p>MY THOUGHTS&nbsp;</p>

<p>this is bringing back memory&nbsp;of the 2006 tie fighter&nbsp;polybag, my first lego set and only when i was 4... this set is worth it if you get the set and put it with other Milano&nbsp;although&nbsp;this is unnamed...</p>

"vikings","2019-01-01T22:23:33.23Z","Great Mini Ship","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in the larger polybag&nbsp;bag and has the larger polybag instruction manual.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There aren&#39;t unique or special parts, but the orange and trans-purple colors are really nice to get.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>Really quick and easy. It took me under two minutes to build it. The total piece count for this set is 69.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This is a really nice mini replica of the larger one. It is also nice that the escape pod on the back of the ship was added and can be removed from the rest of the ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>My overall opinion is that this is a great ship. The orange and trans-purple pieces are nice to get since that they are pretty uncommon colors to get. The ability to remove the escape pod from the rest of the ship like the large scale model is really cool. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is the Guardians of the Galaxy ship, the Benatar, from the Avengers: Infinity War movie. It is a polybag set that comes with 69 pcs., no minifig.</p>

<p><strong>Why I bought this item:</strong></p>

<p>I am a huge Avengers fan and collect the LEGO Avengers line. I bought this set because I was buying the full size ship(<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76107-1/Thanos-Ultimate-Battle"">76107</a>) and the break apart pod(<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76102-1/Thor-s-Weapon-Quest"">76102</a>). I saw this in the aisle and thought it would be cool to own the miniature version of the ship as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<p>-For a polybag set, 69 pcs. is very generous.</p>

<p>-Great value set.</p>

<p>-Comes with a detachable pod.</p>

<p>-For a polybag set the building experience was excellent. Generally I feel by the time you open a polybag set it is already complete. This felt like a set building experience, even if it wasn&#39;t as extensive as a full size set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<p>-There&nbsp;is not a whole lot of detail, but I think that is to be expected with any miniature set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Impression:</strong></p>

<p>For the value this was a great set. If you are buying the full size version, do yourself a favor and add this set. I put this together before putting the other sets together and it was really cool to see the details come to life in the full-size versions after building this one. I highly recommend this set for collectors and parents.&nbsp;</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-12-01T00:21:16.773Z","Very cool and great playability for a micro build","<p>This set is cheap and it has a lot of playability. You can angle 2 fins on either side or detach a smaller ship from the rear of this one. The fins are very moveable and have a wide rotation range. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes micro models or they like Sci- Fi ships.</p>
