"I_am_Groot","2018-05-28T22:48:17.7Z","Keychain","<p>Pretty good keychain overall. I&#39;m surprised that we get a new face print instead of reusing the one from the Teen Groot figure that came in Thor&#39;s Weapon Quest. Sadly, of course you can not use the head on a normal figure unless you do some DIY work. Just like the normal figure, I wish it had leg printing. I&#39;m not that in to keychains though, so I&#39;m keeping mine sealed as of now.</p>
