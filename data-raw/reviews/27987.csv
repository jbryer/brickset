I began to realize that it lacked certain qualities that other visual dictionaries posses. For one, it didn&#39;t have a list of characters in the back. For another, its timeline was only a basic timeline. It didn&#39;t include every set, rather it had each year and a notable set from that year. To further my disappointment, I noticed that it didn&#39;t contain much information about the 2006-2008 sets. Overall I felt like it wasn&#39;t a typical Lego visual dictionary. Rather it felt like a cheap, slapped together overview of the DC superheroes theme. I did like some of the fun facts and Q&amp;A with the designers.&nbsp; Not quite worth your money. Good thing I got it on sale.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-01-01T21:48:47.43Z","Incomplete Edition. Out of Date, but still somewhat engaging.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>LEGO DC Super Heroes Visual Dictionary:</b> It has been six years since LEGO first introduced the DC Super Heroes Theme, in that time we&rsquo;ve seen DK give us a few books. The original Visual Dictionary printed in 2012 was titled LEGO Batman Visual Dictionary and focused more on the original 2006 era Batman theme before showing the new 2012 era sets of DC Super Heroes. Now we have a fully dedicated title, which has a few problems in my opinion.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Presentation</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The book is very well put together with clear, crisp images on the pages and front and back covers. It is what we&rsquo;ve come to expect from these unique Visual Dictionary style books and it focuses a lot on the characters and themes found from 2012 to the present year of DC Super Hero sets. It&rsquo;s actually quite impressive and I love the overall page design and layout they&rsquo;ve done for the Visual Dictionaries since they first started publishing them.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Yellow Lantern Batman: Depicting the look of Batman as a member of the Sinestro Corps, this Minifigure captures the detail of the Yellow Lantern costume quite nicely. He has a solid looking double-sided torso with a nice bit of printing on his legs and a unique pair of facial expressions with a yellow tinted band used for his eyes instead of the typical white bands on most other Batman Minifigures.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The soft goods cape piece is used and the newer cowl piece. About the only complaint I&rsquo;d have for this Minifigure is the fact we still haven&rsquo;t gotten any actual ring accessories for any of the lantern characters in Minifigure form to date.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Contents</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Here is where we start to see some minor problems. Chief among them is the HUGE focus that Batman gets compared to the other Super Heroes. While there are some pages dedicated to vehicles and characters seen in the other sets, Batman still has the vast majority of sets dedicated to him so he and the rogues gallery take top billings.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There also seems to be some glaring omissions. While many of the sets are featured including most of the Mighty Micros and even a handful of Dimensions sets there are some Polybags which are not referenced. A few printing errors are also present as one of them is missing the set number in the call-out box for set details. We also have a very large section of the book dedicated to The LEGO Batman Movie, which means that Batman really does get the lion&rsquo;s share of the pages dedicated to him.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This wouldn&rsquo;t be nearly as big a problem as it is if they&rsquo;d just added a few more pages with a dedicated set listing of DC Super Heroes, this book does not feature that. Many of the past Visual Dictionaries included a few pages with all of the sets, although some of those set lists were only seen in the Character Encyclopedia&rsquo;s. This is still a bit of a problem as it means we don&rsquo;t have a lot going on, there is some discussion of the Duplo theme, but none for the Juniors based DC sets also omitted are the constraction trio of sets created for the launch of the line.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">These omissions while dedicating an entire chapter of the book to The LEGO Batman Movie, a separate Theme from DC Super Heroes even if the Minifigures are part of the Theme according to Brickset means the contents of the book, while engaging and always fun to read, do not cover the entirety of the DC Super Heroes Theme itself. And for something touting itself as the DC Super Heroes Visual Dictionary this is a huge let down.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I got this at Costco for half the CND cover price, so I still feel I got my money&rsquo;s worth out of this title. I would strongly recommend picking it up if you like collecting DK Visual Dictionaries, just be aware that the database of sets and the material inside does not cover the entire range. Considering The LEGO Batman Movie had it&rsquo;s own dedicated Essential Guide written up last year as well, including an entire chapter for that Theme alone seems like a huge missed opportunity. I certainly hope if DK ever gets around to publishing a Marvel Super Heroes Visual Dictionary they don&rsquo;t ignore any of the sets in favor of discussing arbitrary stuff like the old Spider-Man and Studios based Marvel sets of the past.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Strongly recommended.</p>
