The printed torso and legs are awesome for some mocs. I had once the dragon sword, but lost it, really good to have it back for this cheap price. The hair piece is a bit too smooth, I liked the older lego hairs better, than these new &quot;animated movie hairs&quot;, but still a fine piece to work with.</p>

<p>Overall, this minifigure and the magazine are worth the money, great for those, who&#39;re collecting figures.</p>
