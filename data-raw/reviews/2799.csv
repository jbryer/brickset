I'm a huge fan of model team (bring it back, Lego!), and while it's kind of small for a model team set it was fun to build and includes several moving parts and features.  The cabin hatch opens, the engines lower/raise, the bench seat reclines, propellers spin, and the antennaes tip back.  I haven't built the alternate model and don't plan to (it looks pretty lame).  

The set comes with some good parts and really has a nice look to it--good angles--it really looks the part of a speed boat.  It's also important to note that it's actually much bigger than the pictures make it look.  It's just under a foot (30cm), or 35 studs long.  Of course, it's not seaworthy, but it makes a nice display piece and addition to any collection.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
