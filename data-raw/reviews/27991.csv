"Oeuf0platieN","2018-08-14T13:22:36.51Z","Nice exclusive souvenir from an awesome place","<p>The LEGO House in Billund hosts one of the biggest LEGO buildings you might ever be able to take a look at : the&nbsp;Tree of Creativity. Rising to an impressive height of 15.68 meters, it stands at the heart of the House. Built with more than 6,000,000 bricks, this monumental structure undoubtedly makes a big impression on any visitor, so it was arguably a good idea to base a set on this model.</p>

<p>4000026 thus offers a small rendition of its gigantic counterpart and is strongly reminiscent of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4000024-1/LEGO-House-Tree-of-Creativity"">LEGO Inside Tour 2017 exclusive </a><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4000024-1/LEGO-House-Tree-of-Creativity"">gift</a>&nbsp;since they&#39;re sharing most of their features - this set only being a revised version of its exclusive predecessor.</p>

<h3>Availability</h3>

<p>This Tree of Creativity is exclusive to the Store of the Lego House, and retails for DKK 599.00 - about 80&euro; / $90 / &pound;70. However, it has a production run of 10,000 sets so it is therefore a limited edition set.</p>

<h3>Box</h3>

<p>The front of the box shows the assembled tree next to&nbsp;the included&nbsp;minifigure, giving an idea of the actual size of the building. The box wears the traditional LEGO logo along with a&nbsp;HOUSE Home of the Brick<strong>&nbsp;</strong>logo which can be found on every LEGO House exclusive product - excepted, strangely enough, the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21037-1/LEGO-House"">one</a>&nbsp;which actually represents the&nbsp;House. The white walls, tan floor and expositions shelves in the background recall the indoor design&nbsp;of the place.</p>

<p>The rear of the box displays an aerial picture of the LEGO House and a glance at the real Tree of Creativity&nbsp;as well as some facts about the building and the Tree of Creativity, which will be both found once again in the instruction booklet.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1837/43310525404_090f7bf89f.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The box measures 38&times;26&times;7cm, so it should fit into a large backpack or a small suitcase in order to be brought back home, depending of your traveling style and/or mean of transport.</p>

<h3>Content</h3>

<p>Inside the box, you will find six bags and the instruction booklet. This set doesn&#39;t include any sticker sheet, nor any particularly large piece&nbsp;higgledy-piggledy&nbsp;placed into the box. The bags are not numbered, so each step requires to search through the whole stack of bricks. Speaking about them, this set only includes fairly common pieces (or at least it seemed so&nbsp;to me while building). There are a total of 837 bricks (a lot&nbsp;of green and brown of course), 120 of them being&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4621557/plate-1x1"">bright yellowish green 1&times;1 plates</a>. A&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4654448/element-seperator"">brick separator</a>&nbsp;is also included. In the booklet, bricks added to the build are highlighted in red.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>A single minifigure is included, yet it is an exclusive one. While the smiling face and blue pants have already appeared in numerous sets, the tan textured hair piece is pretty rare, appearing only in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6138703"">two other sets</a>. The head doesn&#39;t feature an alternate face, but I suppose that the smiling one is enough to picture the amazement of the minifig at the sight of the tree.</p>

<p>The white torso, featuring the Home of the brick logo on the front and some creased details on the back, is only shared with keychains&nbsp;sold in the House, and a minifigure in the Inside Tour set, so this is your best way to add this exclusive torso to your collection if you&#39;re not into dismantling keychains. And don&#39;t let the shirt fool you : despite the logo, this is not an employee, since they&#39;re wearing some light blue polo shirts.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1835/29092219267_79177981a7.jpg"" /></p>

<p>On the whole I find it to be an enjoyable minifigure, which can act as an enthusiastic yet generic tourist, and the lack of accessory is acceptable since most of visitors in the House just enter with a phone or so. However, at least a second minifigure&nbsp;could have been included, as the House is more of the crowded type ...</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>One of the fun aspects of the build is that it takes place from the roots to the top, so the building will kind of grow in front of you the way a real tree would - yet on a real tree, the oldest part would be at the top, but let&#39;s not mind... Every step is about building the roots, then adding some leaves, expanding the trunk, grow some foliage, and begin again. But the building experience is not as linear as it could seem. Since the bags were not numbered, I&#39;ve decided to divide the building into different stages, in order to show you the process.</p>

<p>The real Tree of Creativity features a pool of gree pieces at its base, represented here by 48&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4569058/plate-1x1-round"">green round plates</a>. The four colorful plates (orange, pink, yellow and blue) help you to orient the tree in the good position during the building process, and will be covered by green bricks at the end. The roots consists of slopes, and at the base of the trunk you will find a carving of the good old&nbsp;<a href=""http://lego.wikia.com/wiki/LEGO_Duck"">wooden duck</a>&nbsp;produced by the company at its beginning, just like it is on the real tree which relates the story of the brand since its creation through different buildings across the tree.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1791/42220145520_0c6f662243.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Inside the trunk, a Technic frame insures the sturdyness&nbsp;of the build. The whole set is built around it, with an hollow brown trunk which allows the frame to rise inside of it - probably the way the actual metallic frame does in its big brother. Here you can also find the first buildings on the leaves : a castle and a fire truck.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1795/43980814572_9ce0e31789.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The ten branches that compose the foliage follow the same symmetrical pattern, even for the bright yellowish leaves which could have been placed differently in order to give some uniqueness to each branch ...&nbsp;but since their builds are split all along the construction,&nbsp;it is never really boring. Moreover, since the interest of the set resides into the mini-builds on some of them, it is even rather enjoyable. At this stage, you&#39;ll have added a railway&nbsp;station, a rocket and a woodpecker.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1800/42220148550_e769dd5d28.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The top of the tree, which is supposed to illustrate the never-ending story of the company with a crane lifting some new leaves to add on a future branch, ironically marks the end of your building session. Along with the rocket and its exhaust fumes, I&#39;ve found the crane to be the best mini-model of the tree. The fact that it is built with Technic beams in the continuity of the Technic frame is also a good point to me.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1835/42220151630_ed02404e59.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Here you go with the &quot;back&quot; view of the finished model, even though there&#39;s not really any&nbsp; so-called best side to expose the model. It is a really pleasant model to watch from any direction.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1817/43980815842_25b9e08845.jpg"" /></p>

<p>It must be said that while brick-built trees are common in Lego sets, this one is probably the taller ever released, and one of the few whose aim is to picture a tree. Seen from above, the green foliage and the mini-builds allow the exposition of a colorful&nbsp;but natural-looking ornament.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1833/42220153500_e910ea5115.jpg"" /></p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The final model is about 35cm high.</p>

<p>Unlike the House which sells it, where playability is the master word, this set is purely an exposition model : most of the children who visit the Experience Zones won&#39;t feel really attracted to this tree once it has been built. However, for grown-up visitors, I think it&nbsp;is a really beautiful indoor ornament, reminiscent of a Lego bonsai tree so pretty soothing&nbsp;...</p>

<p>If your Lego budget is low once in the House, which would be understandable because of the trip to Denmark, and that you can only buy one set there, you should rather go for the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21037-1/LEGO-House"">21037 Lego House</a>, which can prove to be a cheaper, more colorful and more representative building from your visit ... But this one is also a really good souvenir to bring back from your trip in Billund, paying a more than decent tribute to both its big brother and the Lego history. Through its construction, you will remember some of the builds you&#39;ve actually been able to contemplate on the real scale model if you have paid enough attention. Moreover, its limited availability only increases the appeal of this set, and I&#39;d therefore recommend you to buy this set if you get the opportunity.</p>
