<p>The set comes in a box, and lives in the box. You see the evolution, so to speak, of the LEGO minifigures, that have their 40th&nbsp;anniversary this year too.</p>

<p>The building</p>

<p>Putting together the parts is mostly simple, but it gets tricky at the beginning, because the baseplate is glued into the box. And also the finishing touches should be done with care.</p>

<p>Playing</p>

<p>The set is not a really a set to be played with, you slide a mock-up of an conveyor -belt from left to right with microfigures on. Along with this you see a depiction of the minifigure that was the template for this specific microfigure&nbsp;and the year it was created.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>It is a nice gimmick, brings memories on childhood for me, because some of the figures I still own of this series. It is nice idea, a nice small set.&nbsp;</p>

"dutchlegofan50","2018-04-11T17:04:23.473Z","It all comes down to the details","<p>This set is a very nice promo from to celebrate the 40 anniversary of the minifig. I won&#39;t go into all details that others already have given.</p>

<p>The play factor of this set is determined by the sliding feature of the assembly line and depends on the backdrop card that shows a magnification of the minifig which is displayed by moving the assembly line to the right.</p>

<p>However this is not 100% satisfying. The minifig pictures on the backdrop card are just 1-2 millimeters off. So the year is cut off a bit, which is a shame. Furthermore, when you slide the assembly line to the most right position, you will notice that the fifth minifig picture wil not show in full.</p>

<p>With a little more effort from the designers, especially the designers who did the packaging and printing, these faults could have been avoided easily.</p>

<p>Overall a very nice set with many new parts. Get it if you can.</p>

"HikerCZ","2018-04-12T02:08:06.433Z","Living in a box","<p>Another exciting free promotion set from Lego. I&#39;ll probably repeat a number of things which other reviewers have already&nbsp;pointed out, so please bear with me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After a completely brick-built Lego themed VIP set I was a bit sceptical whether Lego can deliver once again. Based on&nbsp;early previews I&#39;d already been prepared for some of the &#39;surprises&#39;, so no big shocks there.&nbsp;It would&#39;ve&nbsp;been probably worse had I not seen the previews.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, the whole scene is all based inside a paper box; luckily the paper is pretty sturdy, so the shape is not compromised. My&nbsp;intention was to join it with the VIP set, alas&nbsp;the extra floor space is in the way; otherwise the paper background isn&#39;t half&nbsp;bad (for paper that is). The assembly line slides and reveals magnified views of the nanofigs. The line is done well and you get&nbsp;a small cart with it. The sliding mechanism is all right I guess.&nbsp;</p>

<p>PROS: Another Lego employee minifig and a very good one indeed. I&#39;m glad to have it, together with the shop assistant from the&nbsp;VIP set I finally have a Lego team. The nanofigs are gorgeous and with a naked eye it&#39;s difficult to spot any irregularities. A&nbsp;number of Easter eggs on the box. Glossy, high-quality paper manual.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CONS: The play feature seems a bit gimmicky, I&#39;m not a fan of paper in Lego. One of the images doesn&#39;t fully correspond with the&nbsp;figure. The tip of the brush is green, yet no figure features green colour. Glued base plate - a big no no. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, when compared to 40178 VIP Exclusive set, this one seems a tad weaker. That said I&#39;m comparing a set with 205&nbsp;pieces for purchases of 125 EUR, with a one containing 86 pieces for purchases of 55 EUR. So affordability is better, the nanofigs are an&nbsp;absolute highlight for many, therefore collectability seems bigger. I personally could do without the paper box, one brick wall&nbsp;or a plate instead of the carton would satisfy me much more. But once again as a free set it&#39;s nice to have and&nbsp;I do hope Lego will&nbsp;continue in this vein so that we can expand our Lego facilities even further. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
