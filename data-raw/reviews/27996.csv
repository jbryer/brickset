"J14T14","2019-11-05T19:50:08.827Z","Star Destroyer Keychain","<p>I picket this keychain up at the LEGO Story in Downtown Disney and I think that it was a great purchase! I had never owned and LEGO keychains before, so I picked this one up with the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/853792-1/Brick-Separator-Key-Chain"">853792-1 Brick Separator Key Chain</a>. I didn&#39;t use this or take the tag off of it until I went off to collage and I decided to put this on my backpack. It looks really good and I have gotten many compliments from people. It has held together pretty well. The whole model is glued together and the metal ring that attaches the model to the keychain runs through the bridge, so that is very&nbsp;unlikely to break off.</p>

<p>Overall, I really enjoy this keychain. If you are the type of person who doesn&#39;t like keychains or glued models, there is some good news! every part that was used to build this is visible and can easily be built out of common LEGO parts. To build you can just look at pictures online and gather all the parts necessary to build it and you can easily build an unglued model of this keychain. The pieces you need include:</p>

<p>&nbsp;The star destroyer key ring is one with very whacky proportions but (like The micro fighter republic gunship) they work .</p>

<p>Contense-</p>

<p>The build has the bridge on a 1&times;3 light grey plate with two 1&times;1 studs for the generators , the main body is well sloped and the thrusters are very nice with the 1&times;1 baby blue circular tiles .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a set that I would recommend to star wars fans as just a random thing to have .</p>
