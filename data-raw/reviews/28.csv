There are 5 different cars that come in 2 sets, (set 1 10025 and set 2 10022) which contain all the parts necessary to build any of the cars in that set.

The most noticeable feature of these sets is the 1 x 2 silver grille bricks that are used to create the distinctive corrugated metal sheeting affect of the side of the prototype cars. This looks very good and is complemented by the silver backed Santa Fe stickers, which are located top centre of the sides of each car. Bottom centre of the sides is a 1 x 4 tile to allow for the silver backed car number sticker – all necessary alternative numbers are provided – stickers are the same for both sets.  Also included are stickers for the under frame equipment on each car (which differs between sets 1 &amp; 2). There is also a “Super Chief” name board sticker for the 2 x 2 tile on the rear of the observation car – you will only use one of these so have 4 spares.

Set 1 enables you to build either a baggage car or a mail car. The construction of both cars is similar with different window/door combinations depending on which of the versions you need. Most of the alternative parts here relate to the grille bricks not required by adding the 4 extra doors if you make the baggage car. The interiors are much less detailed in set 1 than set 2, but maybe that is because in reality they would be – a baggage car is just a big box. The mail car does have a little more. All or part of the roof sections are removable to gain access to the interiors – which could have benefited from some Minifig passengers in the case of the mail car – which are not included. 

This set is in my view inferior to set 2 in that it does not contain as many alternative parts that will be left over and can be used for other things when you have built the 2 different versions of this set. By contrast the plethora of spares left over from the 3 car set 2 is definitely a bonus this set does not enjoy. However, this is because they are faithful to their prototypes and they should not be penalised for this, but a slight reduction in the price might have been appropriate. I do however prefer the under frame detail on these Set 1 cars so they still rate a maximum score

I've recently read that. I don't know if it's true, but I believe this could probably be the case for the last 10020 sets that were produced. I don't know if the same is true for the mail/baggage waggon (10025). I suppose that set 10022 was produced with old gray bricks only since it was not available from S@H as long as the other Santa Fe stuff but no guarantee on that! I just wanted to warn you about this matter! 

Now on to the review of this waggon: 

This set looks as brilliant as set 10022. But I also believe it is a bit inferior to 10022. You can build two waggons, one for mail and one for baggage. If you built the mail car (4 doors, two on each side), you only have 4 doors left. If you build the other car with eight doors, there are more pieces left since the additional doors take up the space. This set comes with 326 pieces. Just for comparison: 10022 has 411 bricks. So you won't have as many spare parts as with 10022. But this is logical; with this set you can only build two waggons instead of three.

The interior of the mail/baggage waggon is also a bit simpler than that of the three waggons you can build with 10022, but it's - so I believe - difficult to make the interior of the mail and baggage waggons very detailed due to lack of space. For me it's detailed enough anyone. I don't know if there's anything that could have been been added (apart from one or two minifigs, perhaps). What's also true for this waggon is that the roof never fails off. It keeps in place well without moving. And it does not have 10022's constructional flaw! So the studs of the plates on the upside down construction between the wheels do not touch the surface of curved rails. Nevertheless, you should probably check that if your track layout is not on a smooth floor or table but I'd be surprised if it was a problem with the mail/baggage waggon. Maybe this was the reason why 10022 was not available as long as 10025: the constructional flaw. LEGO might have detected it and decided to stop producing 10022. 

Overall, it is a very good set and you know: without it your Super Chief is not complete!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
