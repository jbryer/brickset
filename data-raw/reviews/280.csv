This thing is made out of total of seven parts legs torso arms head mask, and disk. It also has a few rare purple parts. The disk shooting function works well by pulling back the arm it imaditly shoots back sending the disk flying. If you had all six of them you could create some huge Bioncle creature. The only problem is that it is almost entirely made of custom pieces and hard to use in other places.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Due to his mask, the Pakari of Onua, and also his purple and black color combination, this is one of the best little bionicle sets. Onepu also have and arm that launch discs and some other essential pieces, like all the other matoran of this promo. The matoran of this promo, including Onepu are so little but are also an option to do creations with other bionicles. Unfortunately Onepu is really small and have few pieces, so i rate 4/5.

Anywho, the only reason it has 4/5 is due to lack posability. But it was realeased in McDonalds, so it had to be simple. I like the purple. We don't have purple anymore in Bionicle, sadly. Purple is a great color. He wears it well. 
The set's design is, as I said before, very simple. It has a disc flinger for one arm and some sorta claw for the other. There really isn't much else. This set is great though. It's small and cute.
So do you have to buy it? No, unless you want to complete the collection. But is is nice to have as a little set to have

"TBOC","2010-02-01T16:40:35.03Z","Onepu the Ussal rider.","The Touhnga, or McToran if you prefer, were some of my favorite Matoran. Onepu, one out of the two Onu-Matoran to be released in a Touhnga form. He is one of the six Touhnga that were released in the Summer 2001 BIONICLE McDonalds promo.

Onepu is an Onu-Matoran set. So his color scheme includes Black, or Purple, Orange. His secondary color is Purple.

Onepu includes a powerless Purple Pakari, and a Bamboo Disk with a picture of a Great Pakari.

Onepu was the first of the Touhnga I got. I got about Five of him, then I finally Jala, then Maku, Matoro.... and so on.

I mainly love the Purple Pakari. It was one of the better Touhnga masks, like Kongu's Teal powerless Miru. But I'm just rambling now...

The disk throwing arm is one of the only function's He has, allowing him to fling his disk wherever he wants. and the purple legs and mask are just great. Purple being one of the dead colors. I like him a lot.

"vexorian","2010-01-14T18:02:59.733Z","The best and worst mctoran depending on what you want","I got this one in 2002. I remember I purchased it from a cousin that, unlike me, liked mcdonalds but was also not as interested  in Bionicle as I was. 

First of all, I would not really pay for him or any tohunga. I would not recommend going to ebay and trying to desperately get a deal on these guys. They are just not worth it. The design is poor. A minifig has more posability than these guys (ignoring the flexible arms, but you can't really pose them either).

Anyway, there is a chance that maybe you are a Kanohi collector, then maybe getting the mctoran makes sense. But this is where Onepu is the worst mctoran, the Purple pakari is not unique to this set. You can get TWO purple pakaris by getting the nui-jaga. The other mctoran are much better in terms of unique Kanohi.

Then maybe you are in for the nostalgia value and the importance of character. Again, onepu is a weak choice in this regard as he was not really as important of a character as the other mctoran, most of which eventually became toa. 

Of course, maybe you just want to feel a mctoran and have one in your collection, then I recommend the Boxor instead of getting any of these guys. Teh boxor actually comes with something interesting and compensates for the poor mctoran design.

Anyway, Onepu is the best mctoran in one way. His color scheme is the most unique. He is got two useful parts: the purple feet. Basically, in bionicle there are only two sets in which you can get purple pieces, Onepu and the nui-jaga. Purple is very rare even in wider ranges. The only other technic purple sets I can think of are Electro and Spark slizers and that's it - ok there's also the cyber slam theme but that's it. Purple is very rare for MoCs. Even then the feet might not be easy to use in something custom...

Onepu also came with his bamboo disk which could be flung by the matoran's right arm. He also fetured a purple Pakarii.

<p>I got Onepu, Jala and Maku off eBay for about $12, at a price of about $4 each for each SEALED McToran. I got it for a good value. It comes with 8 unique pieces execept&nbsp;the two disc throwing arms which&nbsp;came in the BIONICLE&nbsp;Power Pack with Hafu. He comes with a rare purple color Pakari and purple Tohunga legs. Onepu, Jala and Huki can be combined, so can Maku, Kongu, and Matoro. They can all combine in to Matoran Nui, too. With one hand he can throw a disc. The sets comes with a poster of Onua and Onepu with info on both, on the other side, it gives directions&nbsp;and more&nbsp;info. They were released before anything BIONICLE, so the info was very basic.</p>

"123MrBrick","2015-07-15T00:06:18.51Z","The Purple Onu-Matoran.","<p>I recently got 5 of the McToran (the six McDonalds Bionicle figures) from ebay and I am very happy with them. While Onepu is not my favorite, he is still great.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I got these figures loose so I can&#39;t really say anything here. Look at Brickset&#39;s picture if you want to see the polybag.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Onepu shares all of his parts, with the exception of the mask, with his fellow McToran. However, Onepu features the parts in unique colors. I really like his Bamboo Disk, which features the Kanohi Pakari on it, and the Pakari itself, which is in a cool shade of purple.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set takes maybe 30 seconds. There are only 8 parts in the set, and it is extremely simple to peg it all together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really like the finished product. While it is not the most realistic design, the figure still looks cool. He has several features: his right arm will throw the included Bamboo Disk when pulled back; his other arm will &quot;punch&quot; when pulled back, and he can store his Bamboo Disk on his back. I am kind of worried that the arms will break, but so far nothing has happened. I&nbsp; have not been able to knock his mask off with a punch or Disk throw, which is kind of disappointing.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set will really only appeal to Bionicle fans. Unless you really want to get the whole set of them, I think getting one McToran will bring you the same amount of fun as getting all of them. I mainly got these for the Kanohi masks.</p>
