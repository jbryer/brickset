<p>LEGO really does a great job on free models, posters, mini-figures over the years unlike so many other toy companies out there and this Marvel Comics print, The HULKBUSTER: ULTRON EDITION is no exception.</p>

<p>You got&nbsp;this free on the weekend of March 3rd and 4th, 2018 with any LEGO Marvel Super-Heroes purchase of $25usd&nbsp;or more at your local Lego Store or online.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a powerful, dynamic pose of the Hulkbuster Mark 44 suit by legendary comic book artist Ron Lim, most know for his six year stint on the Silver Surfer as well as the main penciller for the Infinity Gauntlet mini-series (Infinity Gauntlet, Infinity War and Infinity Crusade).</p>

<p>He&#39;s assisted by a couple of collegues of mine, DC Veteran inker Wayne Faucher&nbsp;(Catwoman, Detective Comics, Wonder Woman) who adds a deft line and style to the pencils&nbsp;and vivid colors by Chris Sotomayer&nbsp;(Captain Marvel, The Avengers).</p>

<p>The print measures 10&quot;x13&quot; and is printed on textured thick cardstock. Nice feel and weight (not a cheap print).</p>

<p>For ViP&#39;s, if you purchased the 76105 Hulkbuster: Ultron Edition kit you&#39;d get additionally the black and white version print (same size and texture).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hope Lego does more of these exclusive prints/art for other promotions, besides the Super-Heroes line, and even art from the concept artists working on the actual sets as well.</p>
