<p>Welcome to the new&nbsp;<a href=""https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=Ba43FNGzbQU&amp;mid=13923&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.lego.com%2FJurassic-Park-Velociraptor-Chase-75932"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">LEGO Jurassic Park Velociraptor Chase</a>&nbsp;set! This set is available in the shops now so you&rsquo;ll be wanting to know if it&rsquo;s any good. In this review, I&rsquo;ll try and answer that question for you.</p>

<p>So to begin with, for those that don&rsquo;t know, this is part of the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.lego.com/en-gb/themes/jurassic-world"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">2018 LEGO Jurassic World</a>&nbsp;lineup for the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4881806/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Fallen Kingdom movie</a>. But, this set is based on the original&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0107290/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">Jurassic Park movie</a>&nbsp;from 1993 and is also the first time&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.lego.com/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">LEGO</a>&nbsp;has released a set for that movie. Hooray! I for one was also glad to see it was a playset that really looks to have had a lot of passion for the material put into it.</p>

<p>Starting as usual with the packaging, it comes in a Jurassic World themed Box showing bits of the parks and a Raptor leaning over &ndash; matches the one busting in through the door. You can see the classic control room, kitchen and embryo scenes being re-enacted by the LEGO Minifigures. When I picked it up, I was pleasantly surprised by the weight of it. Coming in at&nbsp;360 parts it does have a good brick count.</p>

<p>Of course the star of the show for the figures is the raptor. This time a chocolate and light brown colour scheme and detailed as ever to the usual high standard. It has a good amount of pose-ability and really get tucked into the various bits of this set.</p>

<p>Overall, it feels like the LEGO designers had plans to expand this set, and you can quite easily enhance this set with some new rooms. Perhaps extend the embryo room out to include the laboratory and hatchery. Add on the restaurant to the kitchen. And the control room is crying out to have the maintenance shed added on. And how about if you added the entrance lobby with the T-rex rescue scene!</p>

<h3>The not so good</h3>

<p>I love this set, but there were a few things I think could have been improved.</p>

<p>First up, this is a small set in layout. But that is due to the price point of the set. The designers have packed a lot in really. So I&rsquo;m wrestling with if it should have been bigger or not. Also, like I said, it feels like they want you to expand it which I like.</p>

<p>There aren&rsquo;t many points that the dinosaur can be attached to the set. This is again related to the size. But it does meant that there&rsquo;s not many point it can stand securely. That makes posing him a little challenging if you want to pose him. Also, only one Raptor. Would have been nice to see a 2nd one. But again, that would have pushed the price up and tbh, there&rsquo;s no room for him.</p>

<p>Last up, and this might be just me, but Lex operates the computer in the movie and this set. But, she has to stand up as she has the short legs. I personally would have preferred bending legs &ndash; she was very tall in the movie so I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s unreasonable. You can see how awkward this looks.</p>

<p>The price to part on this is a little high if you pay the full rrp coming in at 19.5c here in Australia (beaten by Tron which is 21.7c). But this is generally the case with all the franchise sets due to the licensing fees.</p>

<h2>In Conclusion</h2>

<p>You may already have realised that I loved this set. I enjoyed building it, playing with and just looking at it. Like I said in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://gjbricks.com/lego-review/video-review-lego-jurassic-park-velociraptor-chase-75932/"" rel=""noopener"" target=""_blank"">video review this set</a>, this may end up on my desk at work, I love it that much!</p>

<p>This really is a great, fun, feature packed set that does fans a lot of service in its attention to detail and nods to the movie. Kudos to the LEGO Designers for this one.</p>

<p>Pick it up if you love the movie or just like dinosaurs.

"KoolKreeper489","2018-11-19T17:11:44.307Z","Jurassic Park Velociraptor Chase Review","<p>The&nbsp;Jurassic Park Velociraptor Chase set is a great Jurassic&nbsp;World set based on the first Jurassic Park movie. It includes a build that has a kitchen, a control room, the embryo cold storage area, 3 minifigures, and a velociraptor. It was released in 2018 for&nbsp;$39.99 and has 360 pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><strong>Alan Grant-</strong>&nbsp;A great minifigure to get from the original Jurassic Park movie. Has nice printing and has a hat and a hair piece which you could pick which one you would like him to wear. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Ellie Sattler- </strong>She has great printing and a hair piece with her hair down. She also has a double sided head.&nbsp;10/10</p>

<p><strong>Lex Murphy- </strong>She has good printing, short legs, and a double sided face that shows her frowning. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Tim Murphy- </strong>He also has good and accurate printing with short legs and a double sided face that also shows him frowning.10/10</p>

<p><strong>Velociraptor-</strong> A great dinosaur figure with nice printing and a jaw that can move up and down. Its arms and legs are also moveable.10/10</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The build in this set is not completely accurate but still includes areas that are great scenes in the movie. The control room has stickers that look nice for the computers and the door can be locked which is nice for playability. The kitchen is the smallest area in this set but is still a good part to include. You can open the cabinets to have the kids hide in there from the velociraptor. In the kitchen there is a chocolate bar and green jello. The embryo storage room looks good with all the embryos in it. They also include the shaving cream can that Nedry uses in the movie. All of the sections in the set can be taken off and moved around and there is also a ladder in the set which is a good build. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>This set has great minifigures and a great build and this is the only set so far that is based off of the first Jurassic Park movie. This set looks good and is great for playability. This set includes a lot of scenes that are in the movie.I would recommend this set if you are a fan of the original Jurassic&nbsp;Park movies.</p>

</p>

<p><b>Set Overview:</b></p>

<p>-This is set 75932: <i>Jurassic Park Velociraptor Chase.</i> The set is based on the 1993 film &ldquo;Jurassic Park.&rdquo; LEGO first introduced sets in the Jurassic Park line in conjunction with the 2015 film &ldquo;Jurassic World.&rdquo; This is the first set to be based off of the original film. The set is 360 pieces and comes with 4 exclusive minifigs; Allan Grant, Ellie Sattler, Lex Murphy, Tim Murphy.</p>

<p><strong>Why I bought this Set:</strong></p>

<p>-As a kid in the 90&#39;s Jurassic Park was cultural. Every kid had seen the movie. Every kid had a Jurassic Park toy. I was lucky enough to go to Universal studios as a kid and see the replica gates and dodge the T-rex&nbsp;on the coaster. Jurassic park was as much a part of my childhood as LEGO was. I was excited to see LEGO start coming out with sets for Jurassic World, but they weren&#39;t enough to draw me into that theme. When I saw this set it was an instant &quot;need&quot; set. If you are a 90&#39;s kid like myself or simply a fan of Jurassic Park I think you will agree we need more retroactive&nbsp;sets from this line. I hope this set is a sign for future sets because we all know we need that iconic jeep in LEGO form.</p>

<p><b>Minifigures:</b></p>

<p><i>**Pros:</i></p>

<p>-The minfigs are great representations. Allan Grant has a great torso print that is easily recognizable. Ellie comes with a great printed torso and printed legs. The hair pieces and torso prints for Lex and Tim are also good choices. All around these minifigs are great representations of their characters from the film.</p>

<p>-These miningures are exclusive to this set. If you are a fan of the Jurassic Park series you have to add these to your collection.</p>

<p><i>**Cons:</i></p>

<p>-Lex could have been given an adult leg piece or this would have been a good opportunity for LEGO&rsquo;s new medium legs. She is a tall teenager in the movie. I&rsquo;m excited to see what LEGO does with the medium leg pieces in future sets to see if they can better replicate the teenage demographic.</p>

<p>-It would be hard to argue these four characters weren&rsquo;t the best for this set. However, for $40 I think they should have added one more minifig. If they had added Hammond(Richard Attenborough), Malcom(Jeff Goldblum), or Nedry(Wayne Knight) I think it would have upped the nerd factor for this set. Even though all the included characters are essential to the film, I think the iconic characters are those listed above.</p>

</p>

<p><strong>Set-Build:</strong></p>

<p><em>**Pros:</em></p>

<p>-Even though this set is fairly small at 360 pieces, it does a great job of filling space with detail. The embryo lab has great structural detail with the lab machinery and the computer lab utilizes sticker detail for film references such as the Isla Nublar wall map and Nedry computer hack screen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The set utilized the modular connecting pins to make a neat three room build without needing excessive space. Connecting the kitchen to the back of the set was a great way to add depth to the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The door lock mechanism is a neat feature in this set. It was nice to see a lever build not &nbsp; related to a pop out window.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The three rooms they chose for this set were a great choice. The embryo lab, computer room, and kitchen were all iconic locations from the film.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>**Cons:</em></p>

<p>-They should have created a square computer lab with a bit more detail. The triangle base makes it so the only peg space left over is on the platform for the door. Squaring off the lab would have added more space for detail and playability.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The kitchen could have had more detail. Overall its very bare. You have the cabinets you can hide the kids in to re-create the scene from the film, but they should have added small builds like a blender and fire extinguisher that fill in some of the space.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>-There is not a lot of peg space left over in the final build for posing the velociraptor. You can get one leg on an edge peg in a coupe spaces, but for the most part you just have to set it to stand alone in most areas of the set.</p>

<p><b>Overall: </b></p>

<p>- I really enjoyed this set. It has a great set build with some cool and unique aspects like the Embryo lab and door lock. As a fan of the film I think this was a great set that captured a lot of iconic aspects from the original film. The minifigures have great detail and this set is great for display if you can get your velociraptor&nbsp;to stand. I hope this set does well and we see more sets from the original film. I would recommend this set to fans, collectors, and parents looking for playable sets.</p>
