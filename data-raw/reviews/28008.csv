This set is perfect if you get multiple of these to make a big pen for your dinosaurs but its gonna cost you at 39.99 a set ($33 at walmart on rollback). Overall its okay. If you have a vehicle to use the gate like they entering the pen the opening is wide enough for the unimog from the carnotaurus set so that works really well. This has the dilophosauruswhich is really cool looking. Overall it isnt worth the $40 UNLESS you want to build a big pen for the dinos.</p>

<p>As the title suggests this set contains a dilophosaurus, however, it also includes a baby blue (or a baby dilophosaurus, it&#39;s all up to your imagination) which I believe is the cheapest way to get it, apart from the polybag which is hard to get outside of the U.S anyway. The colour&nbsp;scheme of the dilo&nbsp;is a much more mature, and in my opinion, a much better look to this dinosaur than the previous 2015 version in the gyrosphere set.</p>

<p>The Build</p>

<p>The build is essentially just part of an enclosure but it can be seen in 3 parts, an electrified fence, a gate and a watchtower to look over the whole set. The electrified fence has a crane on top of it to transport goods into the pen and has hints of foliage surrounding it. The parts which make the fence itself are quite rare in this colour&nbsp;scheme and they even give you an extra piece! The unimog from the carnotaurus&nbsp;set can actually fit through the gate which makes it useful when going with other sets. There&#39;s an action feature built into this part which is basically just an exploding function, this isn&#39;t implemented too well as two rods stick out pretty awkwardly. They can be easily modified so it isn&#39;t that bad. Last but not least the watchtower is the most jam-packed with stuff inside of it. The bottom floor has a stickered computer screen which has a neat little map of the entire island, a coffee mug and 2 clips to put accessories.The outside of the base layer is covered with an armoured wall which can be &quot;exploded&quot; via a pin on the other side of the tower, which to be honest is also quite easy to spot. They also include a ladder to reach the top level of the tower which has some space to put a minifigure as well as their accessories. The roof of it can be adjusted to your preference. The set also comes with a crate for the baby dinosaur and a crate for the egg included (yup there&#39;s one in this set too.)</p>

<p>The Minifigures</p>

<p>What&#39;s interesting about this set is that in terms of minifigures, it&#39;s essentially a larger battle pack, with all the figures being generic unnamed ACU troopers. However, I found this to be appropriate since, (SPOILER: this scene never appears in the movie), and that this is pretty much an enclosure. Despite all this, I feel like the minifigures&nbsp;are really well detailed, they each have different accessories, faces and headpieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Price</p>

<p>The main downside of this set is the price... in all countries. In the U.S it&#39;s $40 which is way too overpriced in my opinion, not even considering the price to piece ratio. In terms of what you get it still feels like a $35 set, even with the dinosaur included. In the U.K it&#39;s &pound;45 which is even worse, and in Singapore (where I got this set from) it was $100, to put that into perspective the exchange rate from the USD and GBP to the SGD is $40=54.62 and &pound;45=80.56, respectively, making it the worst out of the three. In my opinion, I would recommend getting this set during a sale or waiting until it&#39;s on clearance, as it doesn&#39;t seem to be running out of stock anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Verdict</p>

<p>Overall, if you can manage to get it for a cheaper price then I would definitely recommend this set. It has a great dinosaur (+baby) and the build is quite complete for a set of this size, you can still buy extras of the set to add on to the fencing although I really wouldn&#39;t recommend that option. The play features are serviceable and the minifigures are a modest selection to add on to your display. However, if you can only get this set for it&#39;s store price then I would suggest saving your money for a larger set instead especially if you live in Singapore like I do.&nbsp;</p>

"Bluelegoman","2023-04-21T18:10:30.157Z","NO MAIN CHARACTERS! YAY!","<p>The title says it all, there aren&#39;t any main characters running around in this set for no reason. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I love the fact that any kid can get an Owen or a Claire figure super easy, but they are just simply everywhere, and some sets it doesn&#39;t even make sense to include them. This set though, they decided to just include three ACU figures, which I think we can safely say are great figures to get lots of.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, on to the actual build. I really like the fact that we got a section of a large fence, rather than another random vehicle. They didn&#39;t try to make an entire enclosure that just looks too small for the dino, they made it so that there was a larger section of fence that makes it look like part of a much larger enclosure. Also i think you can combine multiple of these sets to make that larger enclosure. Also, the way the fence was built in this set was very cool.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the Dilophosaurus, eh, its nothing particularly special, although that is to be somewhat expected with a smaller set, the type of Dino fits well in the set, and the colouration of this dinosaur is very good. The baby dinosaur was a nice inclusion as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, 9/10, one of the better designed JP sets I own.&nbsp;</p>
