"I_am_Groot","2018-05-26T21:48:45.683Z","Dual. Molded. Legs.","<p>This set was originally planned to be a Toys-R-Us exclusive, but sadly that did not work out.&nbsp;&nbsp;:(&nbsp;Up until recently it was only available on LEGO.com and in LEGO stores, but thankfully it is now available on Target.com and Walmart.com. (as of 5/26/18) It retails for $69.99 in the U.S. and includes 609 pieces, three minifigures, and two dinosaurs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set comes with 2 dinos. First of all, the baby velociraptor, which comes in two other sets, is very nice.&nbsp; Unfortunately, the left eye will usually&nbsp;be printed lower than the right one. I am super impressed with the T-Rex. Not only does it have an exclusive print, but also an exclusive color! I absolutely love the printing, especially on the head. Like the other three that LEGO has done, it has fantastic articulation. I think it is probably my favorite one LEGO has done yet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three figures are included in this set, which may be a low number compared to others of this price. However, I always prefer quality over quantity, which is very prominent in the exclusive Zia Rodriguez figure. She&#39;s got to be the best looking and most accurate figure in this entire wave. They NAILED both the face design and the expressions. I love how they printed a baby Carnotaurus/T-Rex onto the shirt that matches the&nbsp;new baby dino&nbsp;mold&nbsp;they created for this wave. Although that is not accurate to the design on her shirt in the film, I think it was a great choice made by the designer. Now moving down to&nbsp;her legs... THEY&nbsp;ARE ABSOLUTELY <strong>FANTASTIC!</strong> Not only are they <strong><em>DUAL-MOLDED</em></strong>, but they also have printing on the SIDE OF THE LEGS for her high top shoes. I am very surprised at this, because not even Proxima Midnight or Iron-Spider got that. She also has a light blue syringe. Overall, this is definitely the highlight of the set for me, even more than the T-Rex.&nbsp; The two &quot;guards&quot; included are pretty good as well, but obviously don&#39;t even come near the level of quality of Zia. Both have the same torso and leg prints as all the other guards in the Fallen Kingdom wave. One has the generic&nbsp;Loki face that has been reused a number of times, that in of itself does not bother me but what does is the fact that they used it for two other figures in this wave. (a guard and Eli Mills) He comes with a black bandana and dark blue baseball cap. He also includes a flat-silver stud shooter. I&#39;m not sure if it is supposed to be shooting water or flares.&nbsp;Six trans-light blue studs are included for ammunition. I like the face chosen for the second guard. It adds some diversity to the Fallen Kingdom figure line-up. He also comes with a knit cap and electro staff.</p>

<p>The main build in this set is a Lorry truck to transport the T-Rex in. It is by far the best and most realistic T-Rex transporting vehicle LEGO has made to date. The cab section looks great and has a fair amount of details. The&nbsp;It has room for one figure. The trailer is detachable and has a retractable kickstand which I very much like. By rotating 4 locks (black Bohrok eye pieces) the sides are able to come down for the T-Rex to get out.&nbsp; The top of each side is also able to hinge down which is very useful. The T-Rex fits perfectly inside and the vehicle actually looks capable of containing one for once. Unlike the vehicle included in the T-Rex Tracker set, the cage cannot be removed. That would have been a welcome addition but it is not 100% necessary. Also included is a small mobile lab build. Both sides can be folded up when not in use. It has a stickered computer screen with a printed keyboard. There are two zip line pieces on the back in flat silver with a round&nbsp;1x1 modified tile piece on the end to attach to the back of the T-Rex and a spot on each side to stand a baby dino on for blood transfusion.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is a phenomenal set. The price to part ratio may seem a little high at first&nbsp;but I think it&#39;s fantastic considering you get a massive dinosaur and Zia&#39;s dual-molded legs. It is also $10 cheaper than the Carnotaurus Gyrosphere Escape set, which included less parts. The play value is decent. The build is great, especially compared to previous ones and once again, I love the exclusive T-Rex and Zia Rodriguez minifigure. I&nbsp;definitely would&nbsp;recommend this set to anyone!</p>
