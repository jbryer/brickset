Owen looked ok, but blue looked like something completely different and original. So - based on my experience with Belle and the Beast - when I had a little money to spare, I went out to get them.</p>

<p>Owen was the first to be built. The overall construction is nothing special. The printed pieces are very nice though. Most fun is building the hair, and seeing how the designer has - IMHO quite successfully - tried to make it dynamic. The dart gun is also quite nice.</p>

<p>The star build is Blue, and IMHO it did not disappoint. The construction of the body (including the connection to the tail), bit especially the construction of the face (front) was simple, yet creative and effective. IMHO the creator has done a great job there, combining the requirements of the overall Brickheadz design with the demands made by the normal dimensions of a raptor&#39;s head. The blue accent works well with he dark and sand-green.</p>

<p>Overall, I am very happy with my purchase. They make a nice couple, that could easily be displayed in a small space. Blue can well be an eye-catcher, even though&nbsp;in a somewhat darker corner the green colour might actually be a bit of an effective camouflage. If you like Brickheadz, or dinosaurs, buying this set should certainly be a consideration.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: This box design is all orange showing us that the fiery explosive nature of the volcano on Nublar is erupting here. Also of note is that this is a larger box because both sets are included in a single package. Owen and Blue are seen on the side in a very profile shots that don&rsquo;t show off their on-screen full-body shots, but keeps both characters prominent. Really good box design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: Each BrickHead in this set includes their own manual, this approach is rather unfortunate considering the box is much larger by design and could have included a single non-folded manual to prevent the problems I&rsquo;ve had with these manuals since beginning to review these sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set has a load of BrickHead specific parts including a lot of the 1x2 grey bricks with side studs for the head elements. This set is definitely what makes a good parts pack and I&rsquo;d certainly recommend it alone for that. Plus Blue includes some nice printed elements for her model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Owen: The first build is for Owen and I feel I can&rsquo;t praise these build techniques enough. I really dig how a BrickHead comes together as you work on the model and create a decent little display piece. Owen is just another human to build, but he&rsquo;s very solid and I don&rsquo;t just mean by how sturdy it is to build with bricks.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Blue: This is a really interesting build. I found myself slowly constructing this little model and it surprised me how they managed to use similar techniques to the bipedal characters to make a dangerous velociraptor in this cute looking modified form. The printed elements enhance the look of the model, but the build truly captures the impressiveness of this style of building.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Owen: Here we have a very nice looking model with a tranq gun in his hand. Owen is a solid model and another good representation of the character in BrickHead form. The hair for the model is quite impressive in how the parts and waves in his hairstyle are made up with sloped elements and by the way it&rsquo;s also a nice light tan colour which is a very impressive use of elements.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Blue: This one is my second favorite model next to Elsa. Blue just looks great, making a dinosaur out of bricks with a BrickHead design is just all kind of impressive fun. I particularly enjoyed the making of the tail, torso and head. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that Blue is a unique character making her stand out amongst a host of other BrickHeadz as a model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As a fan of LEGO Jurassic World I am interested in getting everything I can from this Theme. If I had the ability to get some of those hard-to-get gift foil packs I&rsquo;d nab&rsquo;em. So naturally I got this set and this set is a great looking Jurassic World set, the BrickHeadz included in it are two great models and Blue alone is worth the price of admission. I encourage anybody who is a fan of this brick build collection to get this set. Highly Recommended.</p>
