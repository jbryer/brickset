<p>This comes in the normal polybag&nbsp;bag and has a the normal size instruction manual.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There aren&#39;t any cool or unique parts in this set. The total piece count for the set is 42.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was pretty easy. It took me under two minutes to build. The method used to attach the wings to the main part of ship was really cool idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:</strong></p>

<p>Once I finished it, it was really nice. It was bigger and wider than I thought it would be for a polybag. It is really sturdy and resembles the ones from the Solo movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice little Tie Fighter. It is bigger and wider than I thought. The technique used on attaching&nbsp;the wings was also really nice as well. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating</p>

I feel that the lack of printed detailing hinders the model slightly as there are no markings for the Galactic Empire and the cockpit is just a plain large transparent dish instead of the window print seen on older models in a micro scale.</span></span></span></span></p>

At least they didn&rsquo;t include any stickers for detailing. Overall highly recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
