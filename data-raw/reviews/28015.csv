<p>This is a set that compliments the main 2018 City Mining <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-City/year-2018/subtheme-Mining"">sets</a> perfectly.&nbsp; The set comprises of <em>Miner Mike</em> and a substantial brick-built rock element to mine.</p>

<p><strong>Packet</strong></p>

<p>The foil bag contains all the elements nicely and once removed from the comic&#39;s front cover is nice and&nbsp;chunky due to the parts contained.&nbsp; The main&nbsp;image is of <em>Miner Mike </em>himself, waving with a lop-sided grin as he happily mines for his gold.&nbsp; Interestingly the top-right image is of <em>Miner Mike </em>whereas the rest of the 2018 City Mining sets have a cleaner shaven miner.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p><em>Miner Mike </em>is the main character for issue 6 (11th April to 15th May 2018) of the Lego City Comic and is the only Minifgure you get with this packet.&nbsp; He only appears in one of the four&nbsp;main sets, which is the Mining Power Splitter (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60185-1/Mining-Power-Splitter"">60185</a>) priced &pound;12.99 in the UK.&nbsp; His legs are not printed, but they match the printed braces on his torso, which also sports an orange vest and bare arms with dark gray gloves.&nbsp; <em>Miner Mike </em>has clearly put in a long shift as he has not had a shave for a while and has a mark&nbsp;on his face indicating the&nbsp;hard work he has completed.&nbsp; He comes with a pick axe and brick-built detonator too.</p>

<p><strong>Main Build/Parts</strong></p>

<p>Along with the Minifigure you get a 4x5 build to represent a reasonably sized section of rock that&nbsp;when completed is three full bricks high.&nbsp; A simple but very effective mechanism allows you to pop the two 2x3 sloped bricks from the top to reveal the gold within, sat on a 2x2 jumper plate.&nbsp; The mechanism can be operated by pushing down, or you could use <em>Miner Mike&#39;s </em>pick to lever it open.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are no extra special parts in the set in my view, however the gold piece is new for 2018 and if you don&#39;t have any of the other sets from this theme (for which there are 23 of these elements) you would be looking at around &pound;70 for the Elves set that contains it (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/41196-1/The-Elvenstar-Tree-Bat-Attack"">41196</a>) or the &pound;300 Roller Coaster (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/10261-1/Roller-Coaster"">10261</a>)!</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>This is definitely worth getting if you can.&nbsp; It&#39;s not the best in the line but certainly one of the better ones.&nbsp; The comic was priced &pound;3.85 so if you only want the Minifigure&nbsp;it would be cheaper than buying <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60185-1/Mining-Power-Splitter"">60185</a>&nbsp;(this review is about six months after the comic was sold!).&nbsp; I personally think the comic sets are generally quite strong and this one has a Minifigure, a fun explosion mechanism and would give younger children a good introduction into creating their own builds in a simple way using a few bricks.</p>
