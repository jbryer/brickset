<p>The build is simple but has some nice details, including some simple SNOT techniques and nice little mini-builds like the lawn mower.&nbsp; One minifigure is included.&nbsp; This bearded dude with a flannel shirt and messy hair looks the part.&nbsp; There is a great range of parts included in this set, including a door and window which are not shown in most pictures of the set.&nbsp; The great thing about these parts it that once you have built the set as a pencil holder, you could use the parts as the basis for building your own Lego houses by adding other pieces in your collection.</p>

<p>The completed model looks wonderful in a way reminiscent of traditional Lego house sets.&nbsp; The house is the right size to function as a pencil/pen holder.&nbsp; The garage door opens to allow small items to be recovered from the bottom of the pot.&nbsp; The house can also be easily lifted off the base to tip things out of it.&nbsp; This square house can also be placed on the base facing in different directions, which is good because the other sides not shown in the photo are interesting in their own right.&nbsp; The garden bed is another nice little build.&nbsp; It is too small to house post-it notes, but could be used for paperclips or a pencil sharpener etc.&nbsp; My only complaint would be the vent structure above the garage door.&nbsp; This serves the function of restricting the movement of the door, but it looks odd and does not seem to replicate any feature seen on normal houses.</p>

<p>The house has two bricks with two holes for technic pins sitting on the base.&nbsp; This allows you to connect the house (but not the green base) to the 40173 picture frame or any of the recent creator buildings.</p>

<p>This set is very reasonably priced, it is a nice little build, and the completed model looks charming and works as a functional pencil/pen holder.&nbsp; In addition you have a great range of pieces to use as part of making your own traditional style Lego houses if you wish.&nbsp; Long after a child has packed away their other Lego sets, this might be sitting on their desk holding their pencils.&nbsp; This set is everything that is good about Lego, and I highly recommend it.</p>

"skywalkerfan52","2020-09-06T19:15:54.907Z","Review: 40188-1 LEGO Pencil pot ","<p>Set 40188-1 LEGO Pencil pot was released in 2018. It retails for about $12.99, 187 pieces, and is recommended for ages 7+. This set is only available at legoland parks.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Pros</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Helps store pencils, a small garage with a red roof, garage door opens smoothly, 3 tools (red crowbar, broom, and shovel) on side of garage, 2 light bulbs outside the garage, a cool mini build of a lawn mower,&nbsp;a blue pot of flowers next to tools, and a clean design of a garden in a box.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Cons</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Could have came with an exclusive mini fig, not a lot of playability for kids, and doesn&#39;t have the room inside the garage to even fit a motorcycle or a bike.</p>

<p>thanks for reading my review:)</p>

"one79","2021-05-08T04:00:48.433Z","Pencil Pot (Garage Style)","<p>This 40188 LEGO&reg; set is a set used as desk accessory that will assist your young one to tidy up their stationary by functioning as pencil pot. This pencil pot has a shape like a garage or shed without roof to place pencils in it. This set is very suitable to be used along with set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40154-1/Iconic-Pencil-Pot"">40154</a> which is also a pencil pot shaped like a house (I will discuss LEGO&reg; set 40154 at another occasion).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This pencil pot has a garage or shed like door feature with a handle that can be opened on the axle-like hinges at the top side. Seems that this door function is to make it easier to take smaller stationary such as short pencil. We do not have to scramble all those long pencils just to take it. Just open the door and take it from there. Simple, right?</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1599093278050-H23RYPZF3SAZ3GLRUN0B/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kBxX7QcyDclQBhYCHwbxl9YUqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8PaoYXhp6HxIwZIk7-Mi3Tsic-L2IOPH3Dwrhl-Ne3Z2cYSQx44Ke2W_Sil3mM9rjxDy3bM_ekv-qrbBkbvMWLYxb27qhdBlCJwccbVYQTp-/LEGO+40188-2.jpg?format=400w"" style=""width: 400px; height: 534px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When looking at the other part of this set, there is a small box used to plant flowers which functions as a place to place small stationary such as paper clips, rubber, or pencil sharpener. Besides that, the pencil pot is also decorated with small LEGO&reg; accessories such as shovel, crowbar and broom. On top of that, there are several flowers that are spread on the set as decoration near the box, on the front garden and near the tools&#39; hanger. There is a window feature that make the pencil pot looks like a small shed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set has some details such as door, canopy, and lamps that made the pencil pot to look more like a house with garage or storeroom. But it is unknown what the purpose of the ventilation on the top part of the pencil pot. This set has a minifigure that wears olive coloured pants and blue shirt with plaid motif and adult&nbsp;head wearing spectacles with beard. The minifigure is arranged cutting a grass with lawnmower. This set also has technic connection that can be used to connect this set to another LEGO&reg; desk accessories set. For you that like to build LEGO&reg; city diorama, you can modify the top part of this pencil pot and change it into a building.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>Well, it finished&nbsp;quite fast but still building any LEGO is an enjoyable experience.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Sufficient parts for this build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Not much feature for children to play. It might hold their attention for a while, but they won&#39;t play with this for a long time unless it is combined with another sets for playing. For adult, with a bit of modification, this can be included in any city diorama.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>This is hard to say, overseas, especially in Europe and US, this set is not expensive. But in Indonesia, this set is quite expensive (more than double the price from US or Europe) since it is not available from the LEGO Certified Store, so we have to buy it from online marketplace. So I just have to set a neutral rating for the value.</p>

<p><strong>Special Note</strong></p>

<p>Please note that I write this review based on my own LEGO Blog article which is available from:&nbsp;<a href=""https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-set-review-40188-pencil-pot"">https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-set-review-40188-pencil-pot</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this insight from me will be useful for all AFOLs out there!</p>
