"BWhyte","2008-01-27T21:58:14.543Z","Fun set","I found this set in my old storage box.  The stickers are worn, but it goes great with my 6375 gas station.  The doors underneath are cool.  The only negative is that it is not minifig sized so the driver cannot &quot;get in&quot; the truck.  He has to hang out at the station.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
