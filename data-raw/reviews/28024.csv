<p>This Minifigure was released&nbsp;as a promotional item for those who preordered the LEGO Incredibles video game. Being a promotional item, it probably wasn&#39;t allowed to use any new pieces so the designer had to try and capture her look with mostly prints. Her outfit is based on her look in the first Incredibles&nbsp;movie and it looks decent. It definitely could have used more detail to capture the wacky, yet fashionable outfit she displayed in the movie. The torse is gunmetal grey with black and silver striped printing and a dark pink color. The face is where it gets a little off. Since no new pieces were allowed, they had to print her glasses onto her head. This was a valiant attempt, but it just doesn&#39;t look good. the alternate face print looks more like Edna than this front one, but I understand that the designer could only do so much.</p>

<p>This Minifigure was okay, but it just looks bad when compared to the more recent&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71024-17/Edna-Mode"">71024-17</a>&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71024-17/Edna-Mode"">Edna Mode</a>&nbsp;Minifigure from Disney Series 2. While the hew hair and glasses piece does look a bit odd, it is a vast improvement&nbsp;when compared to this figure. The only way I would recommend this figure over the other one is if you just have to have every LEGO Incredibles Minifigure (Like me).</p>
