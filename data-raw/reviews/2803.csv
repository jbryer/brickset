Which 'real' car it's supposed to be is confusing because the engine is a V8, and from the decals it's supposed to be a 'Turbo'. The only turbo V8 I know about was the one found in Alfa Romeo's 184T and 185T from the '84 and '85 F1 seasons. But the body of the car isn't quite the same, it looks more like a McLaren MP4/2 (that car was even red and white!) but perhaps they just designed this to be an amalgam of many car designs from the mid-'80s. The engine compartment is nicely detailed complete with black and clear yellow hoses and the rear wheels are accurately much wider than the fronts. The rear wing is particularly beautiful featuring the smaller &quot;winglets&quot; that was an aerodynamic design particularly popular in 1984. This is a fine model that I've proudly displayed for almost 20 years and I give it full points. Cheers.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"chrisvs28","2007-07-31T16:44:49.583Z","Beautifull designed!","I rebuild this set after 20 years. And at some level some parts were a bit difficult. Like the rear wing and placing the steering.
It was my first technics lego set 20 years ago. I was 5 years old and my father build it for me. Even for a small child I was really carefull with it and the condition of the car is still mint. Now it's rebuild again and it look stunning. Nice wide tires at the back. Working steering and nice V8 engine at the back. And I love the exhausts. The rear spoiler is hard to build but nice compared with the real F1 cars of those days. If someone has this set. Rebuild it! Its really worth to give this set some attention.

"speed27","2008-12-31T22:34:35.81Z","Inspired my first MOC's","i remember getting this in about 1987 i think. i had just started to get into formula 1 and thought this would be a great set and it was. however i decided that the detail just wasn't right. i also wanted to pull the car apart like a proper f1 car, chassis, engine, gearbox and wings. my favorite driver at the time was nigel mansell so it was an FW11B that i created! i used technic pins and blocks to mount the engine to the chassis and gearbox and did the same with the front wing. there where 2 radiators (one water and one water/oil) and 2 intercoolers. i created some nice looking turbos and used pneumatic hoses for the exhausts. i even got the yellow, blue and white colour theme.
when the turbo period ended and mansell went to ferrari i redesigned and built the v12 ferrari 640. at this point set 5540 was used to help the creation along.
then when mansell went back to williams i built the championship winning FW14B. i also rebuilt the turbo car but it was now the F187 ferrari. these two moc's are still together. one day when i get round to it i will load the pics onto brickshelf!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-12-18T21:42:52.59Z","Two Beautiful Models","This set has two really good models. The F1 Racer is very cool and fun to play with. The detail on the engine is stunning for a Model Team set. The biplane is nice, but the racecar is the best one. 5 out of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"pinz","2017-12-30T00:10:23.06Z","still a nice model","<p>This model I bought from my saved money, now more than 25 years ago, I build the car and almost forgot about it.</p>

<p>Only lately I opened a Box with some of my old lego-sets in it, still in one piece more or less.</p>

<p>And i found there also the F1-racer. Still looking good and shiny. My kids play with it some times, but they know the have to handle it with care. I think this maybe one of the first sets from lego, wehre they tried to create something from the real world in more detail but without a licensing deal like they had for the Porsche or the Mercedes Arocs&nbsp;or now the Mack.</p>

<p>Besides a very fond memory to the time I bought this model, I like it still, because it is playable, you can steer it and it is not wibbely&nbsp;whobbely&nbsp;like some other models.</p>

<p>If you find it, build it and enjoy it.</p>
