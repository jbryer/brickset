Now we get small little okay builds, or we get something of a bad mini figure. The prints are nice on this and it would be a really cool desk model, but there is one problem, there is a stud on the bottom of BB-8 that doesn&#39;t allow him to sit straight. They were so close to making something really cool but then they didn&#39;t. I wouldn&#39;t recommend buying this on EBay or Bricklink cause it will most likely be overpriced.</p>
