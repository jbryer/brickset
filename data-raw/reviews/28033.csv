It was surprisingly hard to get in the Netherlands, but in the end I am glad I found them.</p>

<p>Their build - generally - was quite a bit of fun. First, I built Marty, and frankly think in the end the designers have captured the movie character extremely well.&nbsp; His body warmer looks great, in color and structure. His hair style is captured pretty well also. Second build was Doc, who IMHO does not live up to the standard set by Marty. The camera is a very nice little accessory I truly like the prints on his coat (both the back, with the radiation sign, as well as the front with the badge that measures radiation doses. Likewise I like the accessories he carries in his hand and on his belt).&nbsp;The one thing I was disappointed in was Doc&#39;s hair. The designer has tried to capture Doc&#39;s wind-swept / unruly hair. The thing I did not like is that the hair design is symmetrical. It makes Doc&#39;s hair look too neat, IMHO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is a very good set, that should be considered seriously by anyone collecting the Brickheadz&nbsp;series. I also think that if you are a movie or Back to the Future fan, this set might be of interest to you. Overall, I see this as one of the better Brickheadz sets released to date.</p>
