"J14T14","2018-11-19T04:49:06.057Z","This Set Won't Leave You Feeling ""Blue""","<p>Unlike a lot of people, I enjoyed the most recent Jurassic World movie. While it is was no where near perfect, It was still enjoyable. So when I found this polybag at my local Target (probably leftover stalk from Toys R Us), I really wanted it and I picked it up.</p>

<p>This is a cute little scene that looks great and it a nice little thing that most kids would enjoy. There is a little water fountain, a crane of sorts to deliver food, a little bone from last nights supper, and a little door that the baby velociraptor (presumably blue based of the coloration) can fit through. There are no exclusive parts in this set, but it is nice to get the baby blue piece in a cheap little set.</p>

<p>Overall this s a nice little set. It would make a great stalking stuffer this time of year. While it is nothing to special, it is still nicer to have as a set than not so I will accept it&#39;s flaws and appreciate it for the cute little set that it is.</p>

<p>This set comes in a polybag with normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some nice pieces in this set. You get two green leafs, a piece of chicken, a small white bone, and (my personal favorite) a baby Velociraptor. The baby Velociraptor is a great piece to get. It has a blue greenish color with two dark blue lines&nbsp;down its back. The total piece count for the set is 48. Overall a nice piece haul, especially for a polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a really good polybag. The baby Velociraptor is the highlight of the set by far. Getting such a cool and unique piece for 3.99 (USD) is really good. The pieces you get are also nice to get. The build itself is pretty good. The dirt ground with a few green leafs looks really nice. The water bowl with the feeding crane really add to it as an enclosure. I am not a huge fan of the opening/door and don&#39;t like that they chose a 2x4 brown plate to go on top. I am not a fan of that color. I would have liked tan or dark blue or a shade of grey that went with the rest of the colors on the upper part of the build. I highly recommend getting this set to add to your Lego collection. This will make a great addition to anyones Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Minifig290","2018-12-30T00:16:59.767Z","Cleverly cute little polybag","<p>Hello there, today I&#39;ll be looking at the Jurassic World baby velociraptor playpen that has 48 pieces. This polybag was available at LEGO shop when you spend &pound;50 or more on Jurassic World sets and later available at TESCO in October 2018 for &pound;4 or free when you bought Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom on either DVD or Blu-Ray, In the US it was available at Walmart for $4. The set contains a small dinosaur who I believe is baby Blue and the playpen itself.</p>

<p><b>Dinosaur</b></p>

<p>In this set there is a small sand green dinosaur piece that i believe is meant to represent Baby Blue, it is printed with dark green markings on his back. On his face he has yellow eyes, his nose and mouth are molded into the piece. He has little arms that have some little details molded in. Finally Blues legs have an anti-stud. Also there is a bone for Blue to feast upon.</p>

<p><b>Build</b></p>

<p>Blue&#39;s playpen is based on two 6x4 brown plates, there are two 2x2 jumper plates that connect the plates together. On one side there is a feeding area where a leg of chicken is hanging from a bar that is connected by a clip attached to a wall that has two telescope pieces to look like bars.</p>

<p>The back wall has more bars on each side of the doorway, that is built using two small tan window frames covered by a brown 2x4 plate that has dark blue slopes and a grid part. On the back corners there are some lights built using a trans yellow stud and 1x1 round gray tile.</p>

<p>And at the final side there is a drinking area that has a dish on a 2x2 round tile with a hole in the middle that is used to present a bowl. The wall is built using a 1x2 trans light blue brick that is used to represent a tank of water, then on top of that is a 1x2 gray plate with a hinge insert that is made to look like a tap.</p>

<p><strong>Drop test</strong></p>

<p>For the second time in one of my reviews im going to do a drop test, I&#39;ve previously tested the LEGO Friends Friendship Flower polybag that I reviewed earlier this year. I&#39;m going to do three drops one from waist hight, chest high and finally head hight, im leaving out the dinosaur and bone as they will definitely become loose</p>

<p><strong>Drop 1</strong></p>

<p>To my surprise the model stayed intact, the only effect of the drop i could see was the hanging chicken leg holder just moved on its clip.</p>

<p><strong>Drop 2</strong></p>

<p>The results of this drop is the exact same as the first drop. lets see what can happen from head hight, anything?</p>

<p><strong>Drop 3</strong></p>

<p>Finally something broke off, it was only the chicken holder that broke everything else though stayed intact not even any stress points of the bricks throughout the whole model&nbsp;</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To conclude this review, I&#39;m very impressed with the sets looks, dinosaur and the models integrity. I love the builds imaginative play as you can make the dinosaur drink from the dish, eat the chicken leg and play around the pen. Its a very impressive polybag that i wished would be a small retail set.</p>

<p>I would definitely recommend this set to anyone who wants a great play set or even as a display model. I&#39;d also say that this set is a worthy investment as I believe due to the sets awesomeness and popularity it will gain value as days go by.</p>

<p><strong>Pros - </strong>Great way to get the small Dino piece, cheap and fairly common to obtain, imaginative play is at the heart of the set.</p>

<p><strong>Cons - </strong>No cons to mention</p>

"LegoHobbitFan","2019-01-08T19:16:06.863Z","Baby Velociraptor Playpen","<p>The baby velociraptor playpen is one of the new Jurassic world sets, a polybag containing 48 pieces and retailing for $3.99. Is it worth it? Read on for my opinion...</p>

<p>Parts: the main draw of this set (atleast&nbsp;for me) was the baby velociraptor. It is sand green with blue highlights, supposedly representing Blue. It is very detailed, and this is the cheapest place you can get it. Beyond that there aren&#39;t many pieces of interest, although there are a couple leaves, a chicken leg, and a few navy&nbsp;blue parts.</p>

<p>Completed model: the model consists of a small pen for the velociraptor. The front is open allowing for easy access, although this will make it pretty easy for the velociraptor to escape. There is an entryway in the back, a small water dish to the left, and a small arm holding the chicken leg to the right. My main problem with the model is all the colors, There are too many, gray, Brown, blue and tan, all clashing. Other than that though it is not a bad&nbsp;model, although not a very interesting one either.</p>

<p>Play and display: I personally feel it is not suited to display, mainly because of the colors. However, it could be good for play, especially with some of the larger sets in the series. The lack of a minifigure lessens the play opportunities a little though.</p>

<p>Overall thought: This is an excellent set, mainly because of the baby velociraptor! While not the best for display, it could suit those interested in play or MOCing quite well. I hope you find this review helpful!</p>

"indykid","2020-07-16T10:28:48.993Z","Great Value set","<p>Grabbed this while waiting for the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75939-1/Dr-Wu-s-Lab-Baby-Dinosaurs-Breakout"">Baby Dinosaurs Breakout</a>&nbsp;set to come off backorder. It&#39;s a&nbsp;fun little set!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Really quick build since it&#39;s a polybag, and surprisingly big for a polybag set as well. It&#39;s got some great pieces. I like the water tank on the side and I like that the feeding stick moves around a bit. There&#39;s an extra bone which is nice--as someone who really doesn&#39;t collect a lot of sets with that part&nbsp;it feels somewhat rare to me. The colors match a lot of the other Jurassic World sets which is good if you&#39;re trying to boost your collection.</p>

<p>Mostly I just got this set because I loved dinosaurs as a kid and the baby dinosaur sets are the cheapest. The baby velociraptor does not disappoint! She&#39;s adorable and has plenty of room to run around in her pen.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For $3.99 this is pretty sweet deal. A fair amount of pieces (the chicken leg, feeding pole,&nbsp;bones, translucent blue 1x2 brick, and baby raptor are the standouts) so even if you&#39;re looking for spare parts it wouldn&#39;t hurt to tack it onto an order. Also a great little gift for kids! Polybags are always an easy build and this would combine great with other sets in its theme.</p>
