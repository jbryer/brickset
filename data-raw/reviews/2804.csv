But this set has a lot of rare parts, like all of the chromes and the wheels (comes with 6), and it was a lot of fun to put together. I didn't realize how many pieces it actually was until I got it. It is very sturdy, well designed, and nice for display. It looks pretty big once it's built. I'm glad I got it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"thebrickbuster","2008-04-20T08:21:40.483Z","Awesome","This kit is fantastic. It is great value for money,fun to build and has very versatile elements. As with all model team sets the detail is just awsome. I don't no why Lego stopped the model team series. It's great for the builders that like vehicles.Also the colour scheme is great.
