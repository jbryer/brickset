The cat might steal the show, but the rest of the set holds its own.&nbsp;</p>

<p>More conventional-looking than the ice cutting machine, the plane does its job and&nbsp;can fit a lot inside.&nbsp;In addition to carrying two minifigures, the plane&rsquo;s cargo hold&nbsp;can store the included&nbsp;snowmobile, the extracted&nbsp;saber-tooth cat, or the two storage containers (there are actually room for three if you have an extra). Contrast this with the extremely small cargo hold in 2014&rsquo;s <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60064-1/Arctic-Supply-Plane"">Arctic Supply Plane, 60064.</a></p>

<p>My first impression of the ice cutter was that it looked ridiculous with such a large saw blade the&nbsp;rest of the vehicle has a really nice design. The cabin and cutter arm can swivel, and the tracks move nicely.&nbsp;The snowmobile is small&nbsp;and unremarkable but nice to have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The inclusion of actual scenery is another strength of this set and the entire 2018 Arctic line: the small ice formation where the cat is housed&nbsp;adds interest and context &nbsp;</p>

<p>I&nbsp;rate this set very high, second only to <a href=""https://shop.lego.com/en-US/Arctic-Mobile-Exploration-Base-60195"">Arctic Mobile&nbsp;Exploration Base</a>. It looks great and offers a lot of play value, and I think it&rsquo;s price is fair for the large volume of items you get.</p>

"CoffeeBrickMan","2018-07-18T13:34:28.393Z","Arctic Beasts","<p>The last of the Arctic 2018 sets has 2 monster vehicles, 4 minifigures and a sabre-toothed tiger. As the &#39;Retail - limited&#39; set for the theme it does not appear in most of the media for the theme, which is a shame - as it looks great.</p>

<p>The box contains 6 numbered bags, 1 book, and a sticker sheet of around 20 stickers.</p>

<p>Bag 1 provides a single minifig - the Driver, his Ice scooter, a couple of crates of gear and the sabre-toothed tiger in a snow/ice block. The crates have a computer, snow shoes, an ice saw, a radio and a couple of torches/lights. The scooter is a simple build and a simple model - nothing particularly interesting. The snow/ice block is moderately substantial, with 3 easily removable &#39;ice&#39; panels to reveal the frozen sabre-toothed tiger inside. This beast is identical to the one in the Arctic Air Transport set.</p>

<p>Bag 2 gives us another minifig (the Expedition Leader), and with Bags 3 and 4, builds the giant tracked saw-blade machine. The saw machine vehicle has a fairly simple technic base, a brick built (with lots of snots) rear engine block. Bag 3 builds the 4 tracked wheels which are all identical but small builds so not really repetitive, although linking the 92 small track pieces into 4x 23 piece tracks is a little. Bag 4 builds the rotating cab, which fits a single minifig. The saw blade arm has 3 click-joint articulation points, with the saw blade itself mounted on a small technic frame with a gear wheel to spin the blade.</p>

<p>The 4x tracked wheels roll really well on hard and soft surfaces, and as the tracks can pivot, it rolls easily over small obstacles, including fingers. You need to lift the saw arm and remove the cab roof and front windscreen to get a minifig in and out, but its not too fiddly. The rotating cab and saw arm articulation makes it easy to position the saw blade to whatever it should be cutting, such as the ice block.</p>

<p>Bag 5 provides 2 minifigs, the pilot and an explorer, and with Bag 6 builds the Supply Plane itself. The plane is a fairly substantial construction, with an Earth Blue base, and Bright Orange Upper. Bag 5 builds the front of the plane, consisting of the cockpit section - accessible by removing the front section and a roof section behind, which has space for the pilot and co-pilot or passenger seat behind; and the cargo bay which is a reasonable size. Bag 6 builds the undercarriage (skiis), wings with engines, tail section and loading ramp.</p>

<p>The tail is mounted on click hinges so it can be full raised and the loading ramp folds down on clips, giving easy access to the cargo bay. The cargo bay will hold the ice scooter, tiger or gear crates - but not all together.</p>

<p>The plane is swoosh able and large enough to carry various gear and animals. The tracked saw-blade machine is an impressive monster which moves nicely in multiple ways.</p>

<p>This set has 10% fewer pieces than the Arctic Mobile Exploration Base, but a 30% lower price tag - which makes it very good value for money.</p>

<p>This is an excellent addition to the City Arctic 2018 theme.</p>
