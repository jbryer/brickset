You could consider this as the equivalent of the UCS of Star Wars. Great thing about the set is it is very detailed. The cockpit has a large space for two minifigures, each with their own set of controls, large front clear screen. You also have two sets of opening doors and the area inside is vast that you could fit an ambulance or small vehicle. If you open the engine top, you can see the inner workings too.

Overall, a great set because of its detail.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

More than ten years later, this set still looks great even though one of the seats is missing. I like the way you can open up a hatch and see the engine just like a real helicopter. The rotor is my favorite part of this set because it shows that Lego took time on this set and I like it when Lego does that. This is such a great set that Lego should rerelease this set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
