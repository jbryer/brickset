"Minifig290","2018-07-30T02:10:31.487Z","Cute Tasty Mysterious Collectable","<p>Hello, today i&rsquo;ll be looking at a&nbsp;Unikitty Blind Bags figure, he is Desert Puppycorn and retails for &pound;3.50 or &pound;4 and is a TESCO exclusive in the UK (not yet released in the US so location of release is unknown) He has 15 pieces plus 6 extras,meaning the&nbsp;price per part on this figure (excluding extras) is 23p/26c.</p>

<p><b>Build and Parts</b></p>

<p>The figure is designed to look like a chocolate desert with sprinkles, His legs and torso is built using 5 parts, 4 of which are for his legs in a nice colour&nbsp;combo, his left leg has the new blue green&nbsp;colour and yellow and his right leg is bubblegum pink and yellow. His printed 1x3 arch is printed with chocolate icing with sprinkles on with more icing dripping down. At the right side of the character there is a red technic ball used to show a cherry as his tail.</p>

<p>Desert Puppycorns&nbsp;head is attached to his body using a black&nbsp;1x1 round tile with minifigure sized handle and a new for Summer 2018 1x3 inverted tile with a hole in the center in a fudge colour&nbsp;brown. His head printed is on a 1x3 brick in regular blue showing his cartoony eyes and cheeks and a smiling face with a small area at the bottom of chocolate icing. Again another new element for 2018 summer is a 1x1 tile with triangles coming down the sides in two colours one in Regular Blue and another in fudge brown. Finally his yellow horn is held in place with a bubblegum pink 1x1 plate with hole in the middle.</p>

<p><b>Extras</b></p>

<p>Each of the 12 in this series come with a new cloud baseplate which is the same area as&nbsp;the usual cmf baseplate&nbsp;but moulded differently.</p>

<p>Now for the first time since 2011 a Collectable blind bag has come with extra pieces, this figure comes with a total of 6:&nbsp;3x 1x1 plates in 3x colours, Yellow&nbsp;horn, Black 1x1 tile with minifigure&nbsp;bar and 1x1 Bubblegum Pink plate with hole.</p>

<p>______________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is overall a great little character it&rsquo;s bright colourful and is a stand out in the series too me. He has somebody of the most exciting and new parts in the series with a total of 3 new elements and 2 prints and also 5 new recolours.</p>

<p>Personally i recommend anyone try get at least 3 or 4 of these figures and try find this character or the Desert Unikitty&nbsp;or Dino Unikitty, but &pound;3.50 does seem a tad overpriced i&rsquo;d wished them to be &pound;3 but i guess the extras and parts make up for the price.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Great look, New elements and colours&nbsp;left right and center, Extras included</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>None to mention&nbsp;</p>

<p>(TESCO is UK supermarket for those wondering)</p>

"Golem25","2018-09-14T21:11:45.927Z","One of the best in the line","<p>Hooooooo boy! Here we go again! It&#39;s me, the most cynical reviewer on Brickset, sinking my teeth into a second figure from the 41775 Unikitty! Blind Bags Series 1. If you haven&#39;t read my first review, on 41775-9 Alien Puppycorn yet, you might want to do that right away as I cover quite a few of the basics of this series there. You can find it quite easily by clicking the &#39;View all reviews by Golem25&#39; link to the left of this review.</p>

<p>To quickly summarize things, this theme is a result of the second time that LEGO and Cartoon Network have teamed up to produce an animated series, the first being the Mixels which I still miss dearly. The partnership between the Danish purveyors of plastic bricks and the American broadcaster has intensified beyond that with the Powerpuff Girls line this year and the Ben 10 constraction sets a few years back. Each bag from this Unikitty! series contains one of twelve figures, which as far as parts go can be divided into three groups (Standing Unikitty, Sitting Unikitty, Puppycorn), which makes feeling out the figure you want an absolute nightmare. As I mentioned in the first review (seriously, go check it out before reading on), 41775-12 Puppycorn was high on my wanted list for this series, and as such, I am quite pleased to have gotten my man/dog/thing. Let&#39;s go ahead and dive right in!</p>

<h3><strong>Packaging</strong></h3>

<p><strong><img alt="""" src=""https://postimg.cc/image/upd6o3zev/"" /></strong></p>

<p>I still can&#39;t seem to get pictures in reviews working, but rest assured that I am holding up the blind bag to the camera whilst sitting in a lounge chair at the swimming pool of the holiday park I am currently residing in for my work (I get paid to sit here? Sweet deal!). As noted in the previous review, these things are a fine, clean white defaced by a bunch of random items (pizza, skull, etc.), a lot of Legalese (the fine print on the back no one ever reads), and five of the figures you could possibly find within.</p>

<p>My main issue with this packaging is that it, much like other blind bags, does not give a single preview of its contents. This works fine for the regular Collectible Minifigure Series, but given that you can only feel out three different groups of figures (which give you, at best, a fifty percent chance of landing the figure you want), you can expect to get a lot (say it in all caps with me, A LOT) of duplicates if you go for the full set. This is made slightly less torturous by the fact that all 12 figures have an equal chance of appearing, as each box of 60 has 5 copies of each.</p>

<h3><strong>Build &amp; Parts</strong></h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://postimg.cc/image/pn0g6o2jb/"" /></p>

<p>Just imagine there was a picture of 41775-12 Dessert Puppycorn&#39;s contents splayed out across a lounge chair above this text here. Officially this set comes with 15 pieces, but you will find it to actually have 21 what with 6 spare parts being included. No instructions are provided, but you will have no trouble constructing the final product in under minute by just looking at the little foldout you get with the set.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most valuable, or at least &#39;out there&#39; piece in the mix is the arch that makes up Puppycorn&#39;s body; it is printed on three sides (only the short side of the arch not visible on the official artwork is bare) with three unique prints representing what looks to me to be a chocolate coated torso with sprinkles and liquid chocolate dribbling off Puppycorn&#39;s back. These prints simply scream &#39;diabetes&#39; to me, but I like them all the same; the same I cannot say for Puppycorn&#39;s face, which is the only other print present. Printed only on the front, it simply adds a little bit of chocolate to the character&#39;s lower face (plus a droplet to the side of his left eye). Pupils the size of Jupiter finish off the quintessential Unikitty look.</p>

<p>With the prints out of the way, we find two of the new earpiece (ear-piece? Piece resembling an animal&#39;s ear, let&#39;s keep it at that), both in a different colour. These are unique to Puppycorn (Unikitty has stuck to cheese slopes), whilst the brown earpiece is exclusive to this set at the time of writing. Pleasing indeed! The unicorn horn in yellow is shared with two other figures in the set, 41775-2 Angry Unikitty and 41775-3 Shades Puppycorn, whilst the 3x1 inverted neck piece in brown is exclusive to this figure. A black neck joint, shared with 41775-3 Shades Puppycorn and 41775-9 Alien Puppycorn finishes off the head, whilst a red technic ball joint represents the tail (this colour was ostensbly chosen to represent a cherry on top of the cake). Four 1x1 plates in yellow, turquoise, and pink make up the boots/socks/paws, and the lovely if somewhat useless cloud baseplate gives this figure something to stand on.</p>

<p>The spares are three 1x1 plates (one in each colour), a black neck joint, pink stud with hole, and unicorn horn. I&#39;ve rated the build for this figure a 4 out of 5 as it is a definite step up from your average CMF, whch occupy a similar space to the Unikitty! series in LEGO&#39;s retail strategy.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigure</strong></h3>

<p>https://postimg.cc/image/umxwf1g07/</p>

<p>(just imagine seeing a picture of Puppycorn posing with his spare parts in front of the pool)</p>

<p>I&#39;ve mentioned it previously and I am quite happy to reiterate that I am a big fan of this figure, having had it as one of my most wished for picks from these blind bags, along with 41775-4 Dinosaur Unikitty, 41775-7 Dessert Unikitty (the natural companion to Dessert Puppycorn), and 41775-8 Camouflage Unikitty.</p>

<p>Considering the figure in the flesh (or should that be in the acrylonitrile butadiene styrene?), the print for the body arch does not disappoint as it is pretty much perfect and just lovely to have, but much to my horror, the faceprint on this figure came out rather terrible. The paint on Puppycorn&#39;s nose is so thin that spots of blue pop up through the medium nougat, whilst the black applications are rather sloppy and bleed over into other colours. Finally, the line where tan meets blue is so thin that I really do not know what to say. I am apalled. This is a retail product for which LEGO charges megabucks (considering what you get for it), yet they have failed on what could very well be the most important part of the figure!</p>

<p>Additionally, a problem that is shared between this figure and the others is the fact that the 1x3 neck bracket and the ears feature incredibly obvious spruce marks. This once again confounds me, especially in the case of the former; LEGO has been producing quality 1x3 plates for decades without spruce marks, but for these neck brackets that have more or less the same size and shape, they leave these abhorrent marks! Cost cutting to widen your profit margin is one thing, but this is just unacceptable. Would children care about these spruce marks? Not really, I imagine, but as adults we should act as gatekeepers to quality; today&#39;s children deserve the same proper quality we ourselves enjoyed in the past. Actually, they might deserve even better quality what with technical advances, and they should demand it as well, for the money they give to LEGO could just have easily gone ot their favourite app or game.</p>

<p>As the toy market shrinks and digital offerings take flight, it is appalling to think LEGO can get away with this while fans, collectors, and casual hobbyists like me suffer for it. I was really happy to have pulled this figure, I really was, but one close look at that faceprint has knocked the wind out of me. Will I be stupid enough to buy a few more of these blind bags? Probably. Disposable income sure is lovely, but LEGO is doing little to endear themselves to me here.</p>

<h3><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></h3>

<p>What can I say? Five Euros spent to play the Russian roulette of Unikitty! Blind Bags, the stroke of luck in getting one of the figures I really wanted, and the inevitable disappointment of this product not standing up to close scrutiny. It&#39;s just such a shame.</p>

<p>I can tell you right away that I would have adjusted the sliders on this review quite a bit to the right if the faceprint here had been up to snuff, but as things stand, I cannot let this level of apathy on LEGO&#39;s part pass by me. Especially not as these figures cost no less than 5 Euros in my home country. Five! The first few CMF series went for 3 Euros, with the price on those gradually increasing over time with Unikitty! representing a new low (or rather, high) with this unsavoury pricetag. A terrible PPP ratio (the math for which I&#39;ve done in the previous review), with four out of 15 parts showing obvious issues (ears and neck bracket with spruce marks, face with its print) make me rack my brain trying to come up with any kind of justification for how much LEGO is charging, but I simply draw a blank.</p>

<p>This is poor. Concept was amazing, execution is poor (okayish if the faceprint on mine is simply faulty, which I sincerely hope as I would not wish the same disappointment on others), pricing is outrageous. I have to score this figure the same as I did with 41775-9 Alien Unicorn, which, despite it&#39;s inferior concept, at the very least had a good (nay, great) faceprint.</p>

<p>What a shame. Keep a look out for my next review on a figure from this series, which I hope to post this weekend barring a bad stroke of luck seeing me draw a duplicate (two figures in and I&#39;m already dreading my chances.....).</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-04T20:43:41.67Z","Chocolate Cake Topped Puppy.","<p><b>Set #41775 Dessert Puppycorn:</b>&nbsp;After his sister changed herself into a delicious dessert Puppycorn had to join her. Sporting some impressive chocolate detailing with extra chocolate frosting and sprinkles there is less obvious differences in the head print compared to his sister. He&#39;s also using alternate tooth parts for his ears this time.</p>

<p>Something I forgot to mention in previous reviews is the packaging. Using a similar foil package compared to the Blind Bag series of Minifigures, many of these figures also come double bagged in plastic baggies to protect the loss of small parts. Each of them also comes with a fun shaped cloud stand.</p>

<p>Everything about this series was both impressive and yet frustrating as it was a pain to collect all 12. Here&#39;s hoping that if they ever return to this with a Series 2 (doubtful at this point) they at least make more unique parts to help differentiate the variants. Solidly Recommended.</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2021-01-02T13:24:27.413Z","Probably my favourite","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>The dessert puppycorn is most likely my personal favourite of the series as the colours work so well and is so appealing in the final product .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The Minifigure has a yellow unicorn horn attached to a dark pink hollow stud , two puppycorn ears in blue and dark orange , the head is a 1&times;3 blue plate and a 1&times;3 blue brick with chocolate printing , a black stamp piece to connect them , a 1&times;3 dark orange arch brick is used for the body with chocolate and sprinkle printing , two stacks of 1&times;1 plates for the feet and a red technic ball is used for the tail .</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is the standard cloud unikitty stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a fantastic figure and there is not much at all to dislike , the colours are vibrant and the concept is novel and unique so I recommend it .</p>
