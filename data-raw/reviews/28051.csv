<p>She&#39;s definitely sickly looking though with green elements used throughout in various shades, even her horn has changed colour. And of course her tail has alternate striping. It&#39;s nice to see this variant easier to come by even if it doesn&#39;t quite match up with the previous iteration. A fine release, a nice build and a hearty Recommended by me. Recommended.</p>
