<p>Camo unikitty is a very fun surprisingly realistic looking military type figure from the summer 2018 unikitty blind bag series that coincided with the cartoon network series and other sets released.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The Minifigure has a very generic 1x3 pink printed brick for her head . And has the newer style connection to the torso which is a 1x3 blueish green arch brick with very nice camouflage prints and pouches , radios and straps . To the rear their is&nbsp; a generic unikitty tail and perhaps the least interesting parts are the two dark bluish grey plates along with camouflage colours for the front legs . Above every thing else is the headband which has a great print that if you bought in bulk it would make a great camo pattern on military type mocs .</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is the standard cloud unikitty stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>overall this is a good fit to get not the best but still a good one to get and we&#39;ll worth the price .</p>

Camouflage Unikitty includes some highly impressive camo printing on her 1x3 bridge torso element. I wonder if anybody has bought these things and used the parts in weird or fun ways yet? I&#39;ll have to look that up.</p>

<p>Her tail remains unaltered, but she has a printed headband plate on the top of her head and a cute looking design. Definitely another solid Variant from LEGO for this character. Tough to get unless you purchase on the secondary market and don&#39;t try the blind bag purchase approach. But overall, I&#39;d recommend her. Recommended.</p>
