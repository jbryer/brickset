"Golem25","2018-09-28T19:41:46.61Z","Just needs a cherry on top","<p>Did you miss me? Probably not, but with close to a week having passed since my previous 41775 Unikitty! Blind Bag series review, it&#39;s high time for a new dose of cynicism and disappointment to be added to the Brickset&#39;s review section. After pulling Puppycorn three times in a row, our fourth packet has finally yielded a figure of the titular character of this series, and as such, I am proud to review 41775-7 Dessert Unikitty!</p>

<p>Of note is that we have previously reviewed Alien Puppycorn (<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/53901"">read that review here</a>), Dessert Puppycorn (<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/53911"">review here</a>), and Shades Puppycorn (<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/53935"">right here</a>), with the former review in particular going in-depth on the series as a whole. As such, I strongly suggest you read at least Alien Puppycorn&#39;s review, although I dare say all three are well worth your time. Alas, without further ado, let us dive into 41775-7 Dessert Unikitty!</p>

<h3><strong>Packaging</strong></h3>

<p>We&#39;ve been over this before, this series comes in white bags that are absolutely impossible to see through. Four Unikitties and a Puppycorn grace the front cover, although 41775-7 isn&#39;t among them; the back is covered in legalese and is thusly of very little interest.</p>

<p>Because these figures consist of a load of tiny, tiny parts, there is a clear plastic bag inside the white packaging that holds the bricks securely in place in case of an outer hull breach (sounds too dramatic for LEGO packaging but there you go). This also makes feeling for pieces a greater pain than it is with your average Collectible Minifigure series; considering that you can only feel out three different &#39;groups&#39; of figures (covered in the other reviews, click the links above), actually sensing the contents via touch isn&#39;t too effective anyway. For the &#39;Standing Unikitty group&#39; you could, at best, get a 1 out of 6 chance of grabbing the figure you want.</p>

<h3><strong>Build &amp; Parts</strong></h3>

<p>Eagle-eyed observers may have noticed that I have awarded this Unikitty figure the highest score out of all four that I&#39;ve reviewed so far; this is for good reason, as I feel that this is one of if not the strongest figures in the lineup. 41775-12 Dessert Puppycorn comes close, but as my copy suffered from a horrendous printing issue, it&#39;s score lags behind the others.</p>

<p>What then is my reasoning for the high score I&#39;ve awarded to 41775-7 Dessert Unikitty? For one, she comes with FOUR printed parts, two of which are printed on multiple sides. This is a great improvement over Puppycorn figs, which have just two prints. Where her brother has to make do with a plain technic ball joint piece for a tail, Unikitty has her endemic tail piece, which is printed on both sides, whilst she also enjoys the luxury of having eyebrow print on her forehead (the 1x3 plate), which three out of four Puppycorns lack (41775-6 Dalmatian Puppycorn does get a print). As such, the Unikitty figures represent distinct extra value over the Puppycorns.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.postimg.cc/4dC2sZMr/c75e6347-2b17-4f7a-8d1e-5b8e2eda748e.jpg"" /></p>

<p>That&#39;s not where things end for this figure, though; the concept of being covered in &#39;dessert&#39;, or in this case what looks like glazing and sprinkles, is absolutely fantastic and fits the figures and Unikitty&#39;s general theme of sweet/cute/happy-go-lucky/random. Although I would have liked to see more white (whipped cream perhaps?) on Unikitty&#39;s face and eyebrow prints, the pink glazing is fine, whilst the body arch and tail have plenty of white; the former piece also has the pink glazing dribbling over the white base, although the piece itself is hot pink.</p>

<p>As always, you get 6 extras, including three 1x1x1 tiles, the horn, a neck bracket, and a stud with hole through the top.</p>

<p>Judging from the pieces themselves, the only change I would affect here would be to use a white arch for the body, rather than pink, as I feel it would look much, much better with the white print. As things stand, the pink vertical lines at the edges feel rather abrupt and out of place. Nonetheless, full marks from me in this area as the parts are as close to perfect as I could imagine it to be for this figure. The build remains nothing special, although it is good fun for an in-bag-build challenge.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigure</strong></h3>

<p>I think the figure looks absolutely splendid, and it is definitely the best of the figs I&#39;ve pulled so far;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.postimg.cc/SNprsDgz/7a2d6977-4b30-47fa-8662-e45bd1538c73.jpg"" /></p>

<p>As you can see, it is indeed very much suited to be built inside its bag, and I can honestly recommend trying it out for yourself. Even in the bag, Unikitties and Puppycorns are built relatively quickly as you can quickly find the pieces you need amongst the plethora of colours on offer, with the build itself being so straightforward that LEGO didn&#39;t even include instructions. One look at the art of the figure in the leaflet is enough to know how to build it, although you only really need it to figure out how the colours are stacked for the feet.</p>

<p>Unikitty has superior articulation to Puppycorn thanks to its tail not being in the way of the head, which can turn 360 degrees to either side thanks to the new neck piece, which slots into a new 1x3 inverted tile with central hole to create a strong grip; it is no surprise then that the figs for the Unikitty! TV series are less prone to breaking during play than those found in The LEGO Movie and LEGO Universe sets.</p>

<p>I&#39;m pleased to report that the faceprint on this figure is absolutely fantastic, and does not suffer from the horrendous application that plagued my Dessert Puppycorn figure; the various pastel colours look nice and thick and flow well together, although this should be standard rather than something you hope for when unpacking one of these blind bags.</p>

<h3><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></h3>

<p>I think it shall come as no surprise that I am heartily recommending this figure based on its endemic appeal and comparative strengths when shown next to the other figures that are up for grabs. It is also pleasing to note that, just like 41775-5 Shades Unikitty, 41775-7 Dessert Unikitty has some synergy with a Puppycorn figure, 41775-3 Shades Puppycorn in this case.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.postimg.cc/bNW3PpKp/25a3870c-4391-4f08-8710-a190dfea6b67.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Although both put a different spin on their theme (chocolate v. strawberry/cream), you can still very much identify these as belonging together, and I am quite please to have gotten both. Comparing the two you can also note that the eyebrows help make Unikitty more evocative, where Puppycorn is limited by his ears (although these have been mixed up a bit with brown replacing blue on the left ear). The light to dark pink fade on Unikitty&#39;s face and neck isn&#39;t quite as jarring as Puppycorn&#39;s blue to brown, which alone elevates 41775-7 for me.</p>

<p>However, and this really is a shame; the price remains the same, no less than 5 Euros in my country. As such, I cannot recommend you to buy this figure at full price unless you are absolutely dying to get one. The prints and extra packaging do not justify the increase in price over regular CMF series, especially not with Unikitty! being an in-house theme and thus having no licensing fee involved.</p>

<p>I can, however, recommend that you pick 41775-7 up if you find it for cheap on the aftermarket, as it accomplishes everything it sets out to do and then some, and is a lovely display piece despite its size. However, as is more and more often the case with LEGO, the pricetag simply prohibits a better score form being given.</p>

<p>Now, with this review out of the way, do consider checking out the other Unikitty reviews I&#39;ve posted on Brickset to sate your hunger for more of these little collectibles! You can find them via the links at the start of this review, or by clicking &#39;View all reviews by Golem25&#39; under the set&#39;s profile information to the left of this review. For now, I&#39;m off for a dip in&nbsp; the pool, although you can expect me back soon enough for a fresh review of a different fig from this series (unless I pull a duplicate.....)!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-04T17:03:55.64Z","Eat me, I'm made of Cake and Ice Cream!","<p><b>Set #41775 Dessert Unikitty:</b>&nbsp;What can I say about this figure? She&#39;s dressed up as if she were made out of an ice cream cake with sprinkles and melting frosting. Or maybe just a regular cake. Either way she looks scrumptious, and her unique printed elements can be used in a lot of clever and creative ways. The tail is covered in sprinkles, the torso has sprinkles, icing and frosting dripping down and Unikitty&#39;s face... she&#39;s stuck her tongue out, so she can lick herself she tastes that good.</p>

<p>Overall this offering from Series 1 is awesome. Everything about it is Awesome. Wouldn&#39;t you like to be Awesome too? I mean... no, this is a must own figure. Highly Recommended.</p>

<p>Dessert unikitty is joint best of this blind bag series with dessert puppycorn as they are both just so well done and make for a great duo .</p>

<p>The Minifigure uses a dark azure unicorn horn attached to a white hollow stud , two 1&times;1 dark pink cheese slopes for ears , a 1&times;3 pink plate and a 1&times;3 pink brick with icing/ frosting detail , a spring green stamp is used to connect them , the body is a dark pink 1&times;3 arch brick with sprinkle and more icing/frosting detail , two stacks of two 1&times;1 plates for the feet and a printed unikitty tail in dark azure .</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is the standard cloud unikitty stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a very good fig from the lone unikitty series this is a proper display of Legos creativity so I recommed recommend it .</p>
