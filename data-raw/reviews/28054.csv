They called it Series 1, the chances of a Series 2 at this point are relatively slim. Unfortunately.</p>

<p>Rainbow Unikitty uses almost the same building technique from the original LEGO Movie, however they created a new part for the neck area to allow the 1x1 stud with clip on it first seen for the Daleks to plug into a hole. This new&nbsp;1x3 reverse plate allows for a more stable connection of the head, well, now she doesn&#39;t come apart as easily, but her head is still pretty easy to remove.</p>

<p>Her printed detailing includes stars and hearts in numerous colours all over her tail, torso and face. I am not entirely sure what makes this a &#39;Rainbow&#39;, but it at least works out well enough as a new variant of Unikitty.</p>

<p>I think the real problem with this series is there are no unique parts, which makes this truly a blind purchase. Completing a set of 12 or just getting the Unikitty variants you want can be highly difficult. It took me a lot of purchases just to get all 12 items. To that end I suspect this is why LEGO chose not to make a Series 2. Overall I&#39;d recommend this set for fans of Unikitty Variants or the overall look of the character. It&#39;s easy enough to purchase on the secondary market. Other folks may want to skip this sub-theme of Collectible Buildable Characters/Minifigures. Recommended for Fans.</p>
