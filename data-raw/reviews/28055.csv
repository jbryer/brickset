"Golem25","2018-09-09T17:24:55.95Z","Greed isn't alien","<p>It&#39;s September 2018, and the Unikitty! blind bag series has made its way to European shores, where consumers like me have the&nbsp; <em>privilege</em> of buying them in retail stores for no less than 5 Euros (in my country at least). This is an issue that will be addressed later, but I can, for now, assure you that I haven&#39;t made a typo yet; the theme is called Unikitty!, including the exclamation mark, which is the nomer we shall be using throughout the review of this and other entries into the series despite how odd it might be to have the ! pop up in the middle of a sentence.</p>

<p>Regardless, the possibility of this line was discovered well ahead of the first glimpses we ot of the final retail products as the Russian site for Cartoon Network had, inadvertedly, uploaded a promo image of the Unikitty! television series upon which these little collectible figurines are based. Of course, the tv show itself is based on Unikitty, a character from 2014&#39;s The LEGO Movie and its accompanying theme; Unikitty herself appeared in 7 retail sets across the 2014 waves of TLM in various guises (and once as a SDCC exclusive), as one of her defining characteristics was to change colour, size, and appearance based on her mood. This very expressive nature naturally made her quite adept at being tossed into sets as a bit of an aside, as she was made up of small pieces with some printing and could easily be remixed, so too speak; standing and sitting variations appeared, as did her angry, queasy, and Retro Space forms.</p>

<p>Following the dissipation of hype and sets tied to the Movie, Unikitty slipped from the public eye and was limited to but one further retail outing when she appeared alongside a &#39;Cloud Car&#39; in 71231 Unikitty, which was a Fun Pack for the ill-fated LEGO Dimensions game. That is, until the Russian Cartoon Network site decided we deserved a sneak peek at the new series she would star in. I will, for once, hold back and leave my thoughts on the show itself private for now, but as punters had correctly guessed, retail sets appeared for this new joint venture between CN and LEGO, which in some ways might have been a replacement for the Mixels theme (RIP by the way, because the Mixels sets were absolute kino). Where the Mixels were limited to impulse buy sets, Unikitty! has received a number of boxed sets (41451 through 41456 plus 40314) in its initial wave plus this series of Blind Bags. 12 In total, the lowest of any LEGO Blind Bag series to date (including ye olde Bionicle mask sets), with this series lacking the Collectible Minifigure (CMF) designation. Despite being starved of this tag, we shall nonetheless compare Unikitty! and CMF products as they both occupy more or less the same space in LEGO&#39;s catalogue in terms of pricing, size, and function. So hop on board and join me as we dive unnecessarily deep into what basically amounts to a collection of tiny parts packaged in blind bags to ensure kids will inevitably be disappointed and spend more money or become cynical way before they become adults.</p>

<h2><strong>Packaging</strong></h2>

<p>Unikitty! figures come in blind bags that are a tad bit smaller than those of the Mixels, but much, much larger than those of the CMF series. White throughout with a bunch of random items thrown around in the background (pizza slice, hashtag, skull, tennis ball, you get the idea), the blue, unruly Unikitty! letters take centre stage alongside five of the twelve possible occupants of the bag. &#39;Series 1&#39; is listed at the top, which keeps the possibility of a second series open, most likely depending on financial success; this is by no means confirmation of a second series, but given the lead time on these blind bags, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see a second series be released regardless.We know it&#39;s twelve figurines in total in this particular series as a big baby blue and pink button reminds us there are &#39;12 to collect&#39;, which in reality means as much as &#39;12 to get frustrated by because these things are impossible to feel for&#39;.</p>

<p>&#39;Dare you tell us why, oh Golem, these things are hard to feel for?&#39; Well, you imaginative person asking this question, the answer to this comes in two parts, both of which are equally simple; unlike CMFs, these bad boys and girls have their parts packed into a somewhat superfluous platic bag inside the blind bag, one identical to what you would find in boxed sets, meaning that you&#39;ve got two layers of plastic to punch your leery fingers through. The real problem, though, is the second peculiarity of this series over CMFs, namely that there is not one unique figure in the bags in terms of parts selection! As none of these 12 figurines come with unique accessories, we can only identify three main groups of figures based on their identity and stance; once you have figured out which of the three the bag in your hand belongs to, you are entirely reliant on luck to get the figure you want.</p>

<h3><strong>Build &amp; Parts</strong></h3>

<p>Because this is my first review of a 41775 figure, as well as the first review on 41775-9 Alien Puppycorn, this seems like as good a place as any to establish the groupings of figures based on their parts. As mentioned, three of these groups exist;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Standing Unikitty (6 figures, 50% of total)</li>
	<li>Sitting Unikitty (2 figures, 16.67% of total)</li>
	<li>Puppycorn (4 figures, 33.3% of total)</li>
</ul>

<p>To my knowledge, each box of 41775 contains five of each of the twelve figures, making for a total of 60 per box and each figure having an equal chance of popping out, or 8.33 percent. That&#39;s pretty fair, considering the increase in slimy business tactics in recent years by LEGO, including just one copy of a CMF in an entire box (71021-8 Classic Police Officer in 71021 Series 18 and 71022-22 Percival Graves in 71022 Harry Potter &amp; Fantastic Beasts Series 1, not to mention Mr. Gold....), but then you realize that if you want just one specific figure out of this Unikitty! series, you will, by feeling, have a 50% chance AT BEST of pulling your desired target.</p>

<p>That 50% chance is the best case scenario focused on the Sitting Unikitty group (identified by the 2x1 slope piece making up the body), which has only two figures. If you long for just one figure out of the Puppycorn group (identified by his ears and technic ball joint for a tail piece), you have to contend with a 25% chance after feeling up a bag. Standing Unikitty, then, gives you the worst odds with just 16.6666667% after feeling out the cheese slope ears and the arching body. I&#39;m far from a mathematician, but I am not liking those odds.....</p>

<p>Numerical mumbo-jumbo aside, the Puppycorn and Standing Unikitty figures yield 14 parts officially, but with five spares; a horn, two 1x1 squares in differing colours (so in this case, medium blue and white), one 1x1 round stud with hole, and the 1x1 round neck piece, which is new for this series and slots into an inverted 1x3 plate piece that serves as the underside of the face. The four Puppycorns are also unique in that they come with brand new ear pieces, which may be useful for some toothy or architecturally intricate MOCs. With Alien Puppycorn they come in the exclusive dark turquoise colour, which is furthermore found on the head (with exclusive print) and technic ball joint, both of whom can only be found in dark turquoise in this set. The 1x3 plate used as the top of the head is not exclusive, but exceedingly rare, appearing only in 41623 Ariel &amp; Ursula and the ancient 4970 Chrome Crusher from the Rock Raiders theme (*takes a zip from his Limited Edition Monster White Energy Drink* Now that was some theme huh).</p>

<p>The arched body piece and inverted 1x3 neck/lower face are in yellowish green, with the former being exclusive (along with its print) whereas the latter is also used for 41775-11 Queasy Unikitty. The four 1x1 square plates, medium blue 1x1 round stud with hole, and unicorn horn in bright green are the non-exclusive pieces to finish to finish the build off. And no, the horn is not unique to this set in this colour; as with the neck, this also features on Queasy Unikitty. A bit of a shame to see such pieces, which would make for nice recoloured exclusives, used across the series.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigure</strong></h3>

<p>Regardless, who did I pull out of the first of two blind bags purchased while on a nice jog through the countryside? Well, my poolside tearing of the package (this is probably going to be a staple of this particular series of reviews going forward) revealed 41775-9 Alien Puppycorn! Not exactly the figure I wanted most, I must admit; Dinosaur Unikitty, Dalmatian Puppycorn, both Dessert Unikitty and Puppycorn, and Camouflage Unikitty top my list in regards to this series, with Alien Puppycorn a middling average in terms of &#39;want&#39; (ahead of dross like Rainbow, Angry, Sleeping, and Queasy Unikitties).</p>

<p>Puppycorn, like most everything else in the Unikitty! series except for the titular character herself, was not present in The LEGO Movie. Described as an energetic and slightly dim-witted fellow, Puppycorn is Unikitty&#39;s younger brother (and I need not know how that works) and co-star of the series. In the boxed sets he is usually protrayed in medium blue and cream with white/red feet/paws/socks/whatever. Given the prevalence of medium blue in his typical guise, it is no surprise this was chosen as an accent colour for his.... let&#39;s go with paws and the stud that receives the horn. A bit of a nice callback, for sure.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking features here are the incandescent prints for the eyes and the spots found on the front and hind sides of Puppycorn&#39;s body. These reflect light in a really nice manner, and really help to make this figure stand out. Besides the eyes and spots, the forked tongue popped out of the figure&#39;s beak further drives home the idea that this is supposed to be an alien rendition of the character, although I mistakenly identified him as &#39;Lizard Puppycorn&#39; upon popping his parts out of the bag.</p>

<p>I noted previously that he wasn&#39;t my most desired figure to nab, but he does stand out from the crowd a bit in regards to the other eleven. For one, while he shares his colour group with Queasy Unikitty and Dinosaur Unikitty (argueably also Camouflage Unikitty), his yellowish green and teal set him apart, as do his rather odd nature and the spots bestowed upon him. I suppose I have warmed up to this one after getting it in person, and receiving the cloud-shaped white stand is a nice extra that fits the series down to a T (although I much would have preferred this to come with four rather than three studs to accommodate regular minifigures to a greater degree.</p>

<h3><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></h3>

<p>Hooooo boy! As with most every review I have done in recent times, this is where everything falls apart. I alluded to the pricing right at the start of this review and man oh man, is it terrible! 14 Pieces, 5 extras, FIVE EUROS!</p>

<p>Quite how the people at LEGO sleep at night is beyond me (protip; the board are soulless businessmen in suits pushing the profit margin as far as they can), but there you have it; these things cost 4.99 in stores in my country. Knowing that this place is often times ripped-off to a larger degree compared to some other countries on the continent, I would not really be surprised to find the very same blind bags for just 4 Euros elsewhere in Europe, or 4 GBP in the UK (which still is a fifty Eurocent discount on me). Now I am a bit of a soulless businessman myself, and I make more than enough to comfortably blown my money on tiny plastic bricks, but the Calvinist history of the Netherlands has made me and my compatriots incredibly parsimonious and as such, I simply cannot recommend this blind bag series to anyone but the most devout of Unikitty&#39;s fans.</p>

<p>Really, it&#39;s a flatout no from me, but for some reason I&#39;m stil compelled to buy a bunch more of these. LEGO is a good investment after all, but I digress. With the original minifigure series debuting at 3 Euros, which through price increases has now reached 4.50 Euros (starting with Series 18 and Harry Potter Series 1), I am hard-pressed to convey positivity about the Unikitty! series. Regular minifigures are often pointed towards as justifying a horrendous PPP in boxed retail sets, and while there may be a little bit of truth in this narrative LEGO apologists push, the Unikitty! figures simply do not have the same value. One may point to the increased piece count over regular CMFs and the printing of the head and body arch (on multiple sides), but then I am obliged to ask, do minifigures not have the same if not greater amount of printing? Do CMFs not yield a greater development cost through moulds and new parts (some of them may come with zero new parts, but some can have upwards of 3)?</p>

<p>For this series, LEGO didn&#39;t (fully) invest in new moulds, for all but Puppycorn&#39;s ears and the two new neck pieces are new and all three of those pieces are extensively used in the boxed sets. These figures do not even come with an endemic accessory or two like the regular CMFs. Where does the production cost go to warrant raising the price? Am I paying 5 Euros for two admittedly nicely printed pieces? For the added plastic bag inside the blind bag? Was that one even really necessary; although the pieces for the Unikitty! Series are smaller than most in the regular CMFs, surely just the blnd bag would suffice in keeping them in? There is hardly any marketing involved, as the actual TV series is aired by co-producer Cartoon Network and the characters (or at the very least Unikitty herself) are owned by LEGO.</p>

<p>If I follow the official piece count of 14, this set has a PPP of 35.7, but being the generous individual I am (after all, I actually bought these things like a mope), let&#39;s stick to the &#39;real&#39; piece count that includes the 5 spares. 500 Eurocents divided by 19..... 26.3 cents. Ooft, that hurts. That&#39;s a PPP that is unheard of in boxed sets (for now anyway....) and the price increase over other series simply cannot be explained by production costs, so.... yeah, I am letting myself get ripped off in a stupendous manner. It&#39;s like some kind of advanced Stockholm syndrome that makes me seek out LEGO&#39;s highway robbery.</p>

<p>Personal musings aside, the ridiculous PPP plus the feeling-unfriendliness of this series (50% chance of getting the fig you want after feeling at best) and the increased pricetag makes this another low point in LEGO&#39;s consumer friendliness (or lack thereof). If you really want to grab your favourite from this series, I would highly suggest taking to Bricklink immediately and just buying whichever fig you want there without taking the risks of getting doubles. That way, you even support small businesses in the process, which most certainly is better than indulging LEGO&#39;s greed. In fact, it&#39;d be best if this series was a complete commercial failure and shelf-warmed forever. That is perhaps the only way to let LEGO know this pricing policy of theirs is getting out of hand, at the cost of punishing what is a lovely, creative gamble in the form of these somewhat buildable blind bags. A Devil&#39;s dilemma, surely, but do give this some thought to see what may benefit you most in the long run.</p>

<p>I will be reviewing a second set from this blind bag series in the days after this review is published, unless I get unbelievably bad luck and actually pull a double from only my second bag. If that happens, I am burying this theme in my heart because there&#39;s only so much a man can take when it comes to buying plastic building bricks.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-04T19:16:13.423Z","Alien Puppies... Oh No!","<p><b>Set #41775 Alien Puppycorn:</b>&nbsp;I find it truly amazing how many different ideas and prints can be used on simple 1x3 bricks, this truly out-of-this world character would fit in great as a Classic Space monster, Puppycorn uses the exact same pieces as his other builds, but these are all using various shades of green. His pupils have also been modified to truly look out of this world.</p>

<p>Overall while Unikitty seems to go for Cute in most of her variants Puppycorn seems to be oddball whacky and weird and I love it. Definitely recommend getting this one if you can. Recommended.</p>

<p>The alien puppycorn is a nice figure with parts in the really cool teele colour which would otherwise have no reason to exist .&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure has a light green horn attached to a 1&times;1 white hollow stud , two puppycorn ears in teele , a 1&times;3 teele plate and a 1&times;3 teele brick with an extraterrestrial face print , a black stamp to connect the head , a 1&times;3 arch brick in spring green for the body with side printing , two stacks of 1&times;1 plates for the feet and a technic ball in teele for his tail .</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is the standard cloud unikitty stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -&nbsp;</p>

<p>this is a very unique variant for puppycorn and I think that is why this one works so well and for part collectors there are many nice recolours so I recommend it .</p>
