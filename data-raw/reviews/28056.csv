ANGRY KITTY RETURNS!","<p><b>Set #41775 Angry Kitty:</b>&nbsp;This Series 1 Blind Bag offering from the Unikitty Theme gives us another familiar looking variant of Unikitty. The Angry Kitty. She features no printing on the torso, but some nice flame effects on her tail which resemble an explosion and her angry face print makes her look crazed and prepared to bite a Robo-SWAT&#39;s head off.</p>

<p>Not that the Unikitty cartoon featured any such characters. Angry Kitty is a favourite of many and I&#39;m sure she&#39;s one that a lot of folks wanted. It may not have been easy to get, but she is well worth picking up. She fits right in with all the other variants of Angry Kitty and is highly collectible. I would Recommend this one for sure. Recommended.</p>

<p>Angry unikitty is the least original of the series as Lego had already released two variants prior and they both were better than this .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The Minifigure uses a yellow unicorn horn attached to an orange hollow stud , two 1&times;1 red cheese slopes for ears , a 1&times;3 red plate and a 1&times;3 red brick with eye brown printing along with a ferocious face print , a yellow stamp piece is used to connect them , a 1&times;3 red arch brick with two stacks of two 1&times;1 plates for the feet and a printed unikitty tail in orange .</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is the standard cloud unikitty stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this would be a unique and cool figure it wasn&#39;t the third rendition of this type of unikitty so I don&#39;t really recommend it .</p>
