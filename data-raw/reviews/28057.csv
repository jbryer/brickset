I'm a Dinosaur!","<p><b>Set #41775 Dinosaur Unikitty:&nbsp;</b>This cute variant from the blind bag range uses all green parts for Unikitty&#39;s torso and tail and other parts. Her tail has been printed with scales and spikes, her torso is equally covered in scales with a cute little light-green chest detail on the front of the bridge brick and her face shows Unikitty looking out from inside a Dinosaur head mask. Complete with visible teeth, eyes and nostrils.</p>
