"Golem25","2018-09-21T20:40:45.21Z","Holiday or vacation? Neither apparently!","<p>Can you feel the excitement? After two previous reviews of figures from this series, I am quite happy to present to you all a third review in the matter of just two weeks! Through some strange combination of chance and fate I&#39;ve managed to pull a third Puppycorn in a row, so in honour of the forces of RNG that govern our universe, let us delay matters no further and take a closer look and see what this fig, 41775-3 Shades Puppycorn, is all about!</p>

<p>Actually, we are delaying matters further anyway; I&#39;ve given a deep and detailed introduction to this series in the previous two reviews, and as such, they can be seen as required reading to fully comprehend this one. At the very least, be sure to give the <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/53901"">41775-9 Alien Puppycorn review</a> a read! 41775-12 Dessert Puppycorn has also <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/53911"">been reviewed</a> for your reading pleasure.</p>

<h3><strong>Packaging</strong></h3>

<p>We&#39;ve been over this a couple of times now, so let&#39;s not dilly-dally; 41775-3 comes in a white blind bag with five of the possible figures within on the front. Of note is that, with this figure, we can mark a new first; we&#39;ve finally pulled a cover star, which in this case is also the only rendition of Puppycorn to be featured so prominently.</p>

<p>The pack can be torn open from the back, although I prefer ripping off the top; for this, I typically use my teeth (remember kids, if you are going to use your teeth, make sure you drink lots of milk for that delicious calcium intake). Inside you find a tiny paper foldout showing all twelve of the available figs as well as in-show art of Unikitty and Puppycorn. While true to the show, I would have preferred seeing the actual figs more, although this may be down to my distaste of the rainbow-induced depression that is the Unikitty! television series (yes, the official title includes the exclamation mark). It lacks wit, charm, the production value and original talent behind The LEGO Movie (Lord, Miller, and voice actress Brie), and pretty much anything that would make it the least bit interesting. The parts come in their own plastic bag inside the outer &#39;shell&#39;, so I wish anyone hoping to feel for the contents the best of luck.</p>

<h3><strong>Build &amp; Parts</strong></h3>

<p>I&#39;ve covered the build in detail before (please use the links to my other reviews to catch up if you haven&#39;t already), and will award this Puppycorn 4 out of 5 in that department, as I have done with the previous two. The Unikitty! collecitble series occupies more or less the same pricepoint as the regular CMF series, but as they involve some actual if mindless construction, I contend that this is a fair evaluation (the 4 out of 5, not the actual pricetag but we will get to that later).</p>

<p>WIll you look at that! I finally managed to figure out how to post pictures! That&#39;s.... actually pretty embarassing, considering I have a bachelor&#39;s and master&#39;s degree from the two top universities in my country, yet took this long. Wew lad, I hope these reviews won&#39;t be found out and brought up at my wedding or something like that (jinx).</p>

<p>Either way, you can see all 15 official pieces here, as well as the six spares that LEGO has most graciously packed alongside them. I&#39;ve covered the new pieces shared between the Unikitty! figures in the previous reviews, so I will only call out what is endemic and interesting about this particular fig. For one, the 1x3 arch is printed on no less than three sides; the &#39;front&#39; of the body is decorated with what is supposed to be a deep V-neck collar and a fancy old camera, and probably the highlight of the set for me (could this be incorporated into MOCs? I&#39;d love to see AFOLs try!). The 1 stud wide side opposite this one goes unprinted, but both &#39;sides&#39; feature a colourful print with purple and green mixing it up in little star- and bush-shaped figures. Beneath this piece, Puppycorn has &#39;skin-coloured&#39; (his skin anyway) 1x1 plates, wth below them white ones. A reference to socks in sandals, perhaps? After all, &#39;obnoxious tourist&#39; seems to be the theme for this fig and its Unikitty counterpart, 41775-5 Shades Unikitty.</p>

<p>The funniest thing about this, to me, was referred to previously in the title; rather than bother with region specific words like holiday and vacation (each country in the Anglosphere has a preference for one or the other), LEGO bypasses the problem by naming the figure after the most prominent feature of its head print; the shades, or sunglasses to people lacking in knowledge of street lingo. Where the other ten figures in the series feature humongous eyes as per the Unikitty-standard, 41775-3 and 41775-5 have the eyes fully obscured by the sunglasses, which are accompanied by a wide smile in this figure&#39;s case. I&#39;ve had horrible luck with the face printing previously (my 41775-12 Dessert Puppycorn is faulty), this one is fine for what it is. Yes, LEGO should use thicker prints for these pieces, but this one is servicable. The back of the head is entirely blue.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigure</strong></h3>

<p>Dare I insert another image? I dare say I do!</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.postimg.cc/QNbhnbFt/Whats_App_Image_2018-09-16_at_15.50.08_1.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Here we have 41775-3 Shades Puppycorn sitting on my work laptop at the pool of the holiday park where I am staying atm (for a masterclass training for my employer). Pictured alongside him are the spare parts, which I&#39;ve locked together to minimize the risks of them getting lost. The figure itself is plenty cheery and colourful, and fits well with its surroundings in this case, I reckon. By now I should mention that both of the sides of Puppycorn&#39;s body feature different prints; they aren&#39;t even mirrored, making for a bespoke look on both sides.</p>

<p>As with the other Puppycorn figures, this one has but one point of articulation (two if you stretch the definition and include the horn); its head, which is plugged into a special adapter piece that has been introduced especially for the Unikitty! lines. Unfortunately, the technic ball joint that plays the part of Puppycorn&#39;s tail prevents the head from making full 180 degree swivels, stopping it short by a few degrees on both sides. Not a big issue, but perhaps noteworthy for those hoping to pose the Puppycorn figures with head and body aligned. As per always, there are some horrendous spruce marks that look rather sloppy and seem to betray cost-cutting.</p>

<p>Are there any issues that are unique to this figure, though? Why yes, as the lighting in the picture betrays; the official product art is somewhat misleading in that the tan print of Puppycorn&#39;s face does not match the colour of the neck piece. In fact, the difference is rather obvious, and startling indeed. Even if the print doesn&#39;t seem to be botched on this figure, which has it look fine on its own as a separate piece, slotting it into the neck piece ruins the overall package. I have to say that I am getting quite sick of this, because LEGO seems to keep finding new ways to disappoint me. This issue did not pop up in 41775-12 Dessert Puppycorn and 41775-9 Alien Puppycorn as both of these do not have quite as sharp a colour contrast as 41775-3 Shades Puppycorn does. What a shame, another figure with a bit of a caveat to add to the collection.</p>

<h3><strong>Concluding thoughts</strong></h3>

<p>With everything said and done, a similar summary to that of 41775-12 Dessert Puppycorn lingers in the mind; the figure is excellent in concept, but the execution lets it down rather distressingly.</p>

<p>What&#39;s more is the fact that I have to bring up the price of these figures once more; they retail for 5 Euros in my country, which is absolutely ridiculous for what these products bring to the table. 21 Total pieces, which are all rather small, with just two printed pieces (of which one is printed on three sides). I know that LEGO claims (or loves to pretend) that printing is expensive, but if they can&#39;t get it right on multiple occasions... well, it&#39;s just a bad look. For everyone.</p>

<p>Because where LEGO charges exorbitant amounts of money for what consumers get, making them look greedy in the process, I am stupid enough to keep buying these things. Alas, at the very least I get some strange dopamine-fueled kick out of writing these reviews, but it honestly shouldn&#39;t be left to the writing of a Brickset review for me to get my money&#39;s worth. Where 41775-12 was (hopefully) just a misprint, the tan problem for 41775-3 Shades Puppycorn seems to be by design (or lack thereof), rather than by accident; this, then, is not to be forgiven, and I will have to dock points, in this case from the parts score.</p>

<p>If you like the looks of this fig, I highly suggest you seek a copy out in real life to oggle before committing yourself to gambling on the retail blind bags or buying it off the aftermarket; if the discrepancy between the shades of tan on the neck and face is too jarring for you, give this figure a very, very hard pass. Especially at its current price point, which almost feels like LEGO decided to test the waters and see if anyone would buy their stuff if they overcharged even further. Turns out that, yes, people still buy their products. Fool me once, LEGO, shame on you, but considering this is my third fig (with two more blind bags left unopened), shame on me.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-03T19:00:04.75Z","Prince of Cloud Cuckoo Land!","<p><b>Set #41775 Shades Puppycorn:</b>&nbsp;Prince Puppycorn is apparently Unikitty&#39;s little brother. The character was introduced in the cartoon series and has had a few variants here and there. The build shares some parts with Unikitty, but features a Technic Ball for his tail and two LEGO tooth elements for his ears if I&#39;m not mistaken.</p>

<p>Overall the build is fairly solid, the new connection part is also used for his neck and in spite of what I said in the first review here, the clutch power on these two elements for the neck is somewhat improved over the original Unikitty neck design. Wearing some stylish shades and covered in a floral design &#39;shirt&#39; judging by the print on his brick, Puppycorn also has a camera. This is what he dresses as for the beach or vacation it would seem.</p>

<p>Puppycorn is an interesting new character, enjoy his look, definitely recommend this variant of the character as it features some nice design cues.</p>

<p>Shades puppycorn is an alright but fairly uninteresting variant from such an obscure series full of creativity .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The Minifigure uses a yellow unicorn horn attached to a red hollow stud , two blue puppycorn ears , a 1&times;3 blue plate and a 1&times;3 blue brick with shades printing , a black stamp piece to connect with the head , a 1&times;3 orange arch brick with a camera and a Hawaiian shirt printing , two stacks of two 1&times;1 plates for the feet and a blue technic ball for his tail .</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is the standard cloud unikitty stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is an alright variant but really struggles to stand out from the rest of this series so I don&#39;t really recommend it .</p>
