"Minifig290","2018-07-31T12:59:22.597Z","Weaker Of The 12 But Not Terrible","<p>Hello everyone, today i&rsquo;ll be looking at another 2018 Unikitty Blind Bag character, the figure is Sleepy Unikitty. Each figure retails for &pound;3.50 or $4 and was released i&rsquo;m May 2018 in the UK exclusively to TESCO,&nbsp;but the US gets them August 1st 2018. Sleepy Unikitty has &nbsp; 7 extras on top of 14 parts. I previously reviewed&nbsp;Desert Puppycorn&nbsp;and i&rsquo;ll review Sleepy kitty in a similar fashion.</p>

<p><strong>Build and Parts</strong></p>

<p>Starting at Unikittys legs she is one of 2 who are sitting, her legs are built using 4 parts 3x 1x1 plates in Lavender, Purple and White with a 1x1 brick with a stud on one side in lavender. On the brick is a exclusive tail with a purple print on both sides.</p>

<p>Her torso is a simple 1x2 slope brick in lavender with no print sadly. Her neck is the same as all the other figures in the series using a 1x1 tile with minifigure&nbsp;sized bar but this time in a pink colour, also the new for 2018 1x3 inverted tile with a hole in the middle in a white colour.</p>

<p>Unikittys&nbsp;head is printed onto a 1x3 lavender brick showing her eyes shut with her mouth open with her tongue showing and a Z on each cheek, on top of that is a printed 1x3 lavender plate showing her eyebrows curved. All 12 characters have a horn and a 1x1 round plate with hole in middle this ones colours are purple and white respectively. and she has two 1x1 cheese slopes in purple as ears on each sides of the horn.</p>

<p><strong>Extras</strong></p>

<p>She like every mother character in the series has a new minifigure baseplate shaped like clouds with an stud area of 3x4 with three studs.</p>

<p>For the first time since 2011 a LEGO blind bag has included extras in this series with Sleepy Kitty having 7 3x 1x1 played (three colours) A purple horn, 1x1 round plate with hole in white, a purple cheese slop and 1x1 round tile with minifigure&nbsp;sized bar&nbsp;in pink.</p>

<p>______________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To conclude this review, I&rsquo;d honestly say this is the weakest of the 12 in the series but she&rsquo;s not at all a bad character she has great prints and like the other twelve she&rsquo;s a small parts pack with specialised&nbsp;elements in great colours. But i&rsquo;d wished she been like the other with the 1x3 Arch brick part as they just add more detail but also are 1 plate smaller than this figure.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d recommend Desert&nbsp;Unikitty, Desert Puppycorn&nbsp;and Dino Unikitty&nbsp;from this series.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Parts in new or rarer colours&nbsp;such a Lavender, Extras included, Price</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>Nof major cons just petty stuff such as 1x2 slope other than the 1x3 arch included</p>

<p>TESCO is a UK supermarket for those wondering :)</p>

I&#39;m not sure why purple indicates being sleepy, but she&#39;s using a load of purple parts to build and has a very comical looking expression with closed eyes, tongue lolling and little Zs on her cheeks. No other printing is on the parts from this set, aside from her eyebrows on the 1x3 plate of course.</p>

<p>The buildable Unikitty Series was a chore to collect all twelve, but fun as well. Granted many folks may not appreciate the random chance, but considering that these are all using brick-built parts there&#39;s a lot of value in getting a small batch of parts, especially when Unikitty and Puppycorn use such fun colour options. That being said I know these won&#39;t be for everybody. Still, if you collect all variants of Unikitty, then you will want this to add to your collection.</p>

<p>Recommended.</p>

<p>Sleepy Unikitty is the final Unikitty series 1 figure I have left to review, whilst not being my favourite, it is a nice figure to finish off with.</p>

<p>The figure -</p>

<p>She has a purple horn attached to a 1&times;1 white hollow stud, two purple cheese slopes for ears, a 1&times;3 lavender plate with eyebrow printing, a 1&times;3 lavender brick with a snoring face print, the Unikitty neck attachment in white with a pink stamp&nbsp;piece, a 1&times;2 lavender slope brick with a stack of three 1&times;1 plates in lavender, white and purple and a 1&times;1 lavender snot brick with a printed white tail attached.</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is just the standard cloud Unikitty stand.</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>This is a fun figure and not a bad one to get, but compared to some others from the series this isn&#39;t great, but I still recommend it to blind bag series fans.</p>
