"OhioBobcat555","2009-02-27T00:04:06.59Z","My first Lego set as well...","I got this for either Christmas or my Birthday in 1983 at 3 years of age. For some strange reason you come across this on ebay or somewhere and it is reasonable, pick it up. Especially if you have young children and you're willing to let them play with it. The set offers wonderful directions for simple yet effective sets. The pieces are not exotic at all, and actually you could probably go to the internet or your local Lego store and get the exact pieces with not a great amount of effort. I really lived off this set for two years until I finally got a bunch of sets when I was 5. There are only 300 some pieces, but I still remember being satisfied and feeling as if that was enough for me at the time. The elephant, the red car, and a variety of other simple yet creative creations await from this set. 

These early Basic sets were wonderful for those as me just starting out with Lego. That is why I would recommend any old Basic set as this for your child. But if it is unopened, keep it as a collector. These sets are perfect examples of the late 70s and early 80s Lego and toys in general for young children. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>This became the start of my second Lego generation.&nbsp; I got it for Christmas, probably in 1982 when I was six.&nbsp; Until then I had played with an old set of more or less assorted red and white bricks, but with this, and especially the red door and windows that could be opened, reality came into play.&nbsp; I built the windmill tens of times and maybe the minifigures were my first.</p>

<p>As another reviewer has stated, it felt as if the contents of this set were enough!&nbsp; It had everything that a house had to have, and both then and today, building houses has been the number one for me.</p>

<p>What I have regretted many times, was that in my family the boxes were thrown away, saving only the building instructions and the pieces in a large plastic container.&nbsp; Dozens of times I have wondered what more inspiring constructions were shown on the box.</p>

<p>Anyway, the 555 is a number combination I will never forget, as would later 8680 be.&nbsp; But that is a completely different story...</p>

"J14T14","2018-10-10T23:13:57.5Z","Now I understand...","<p>This is one of the several classic sets that I acquired a while back. I found an incomplete instruction set for this and I knew that I had to rebuild it. I am glad that I did. It has helped me to understand why people are so nostalgic for classic LEGO sets despite the fact that they are really blocky.</p>

<p>This set has two minifigures&nbsp;(one male and one female). The little truck that is included is simple, but it still looks good.</p>

<p>The windmill itself is on a baseplate and is surrounded on two sides by a small fence. There is a door on the front that leads into a small room. You can fit one figure in there, though it is hard to reach in. The second floor has a window on the front and the back, but you can not easily&nbsp;fit a minifigure&nbsp;in there.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a cute little set that sparked a childish instinct of play in me. The only things that move are the windmill and the truck, but it has so much potential for play and imagination that I can not help but love this set and it does seem a little sad that modern sets do not bring out the same instinct as this and other older sets do.</p>
