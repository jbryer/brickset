This series has&nbsp;a nice change to the collectibles minifigures, as it is different - you&#39;re not building a minifigure, but a Unikitty! That said, the characters still fit the high-quality design standard of the normal collectible minifigures.</p>

<p>Building the character was relatively easy - yes, a little harder than a minifigure, but still a very quick build. I particulalry like Puppycorn&#39;s&nbsp;new ear pieces, which are basically a 1x1 tile with an inverted triangle attached to the side. I am slightly opposed to the use of a sphere brick for the tail, rather than a cheese slope or Unikitty tail, but it isn&#39;t too noticeable. One thing I really like about this was the new piece. It isn&#39;t obvious at first glance, but the neck is actually made with different parts than the standard Unikitty from the Lego Movie sets. Instead of a 1x1 stud wih a 1x3 plate on top, there is a 1x1 circle tile with a tube set on top (design 20482), with a 1x1 plate, flat bottom, with a small hole in the centre to connect to&nbsp;the tube. I believe that the latter is a new piece. This is (thankfully) much more stable than the old neck.</p>

<p>The character itself is very cute. It depicts&nbsp;Puppycorn&nbsp;in a Dalmatian costume. He has a printed collar with the letter &#39;P&#39; on it, presumably for Puppycorn. His blue-and-cream face is still easily visible beneath the &#39;hood&#39;, which, like his body, is white with black spots. His ears,&nbsp;horn, and feet are also black and white, but simply soldier colour rather than printed. I am not sure if Puppycorn&nbsp;regularly dresses up as a Dalmatian in the TV show, as I have not seen it. However, this character is definitely a pretty cool one!</p>

<p>It&#39;s most unfortunate that the 1x3 bridge element seems to be prone to cracking. At least as I review this I find that the unique printed element has been cracked in the back. Most unfortunate as this is one of my favourite variants of the character. Ah well, it&#39;s still a highly impressive design and the build is fun. Recommended.</p>
