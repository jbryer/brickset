She matches her brother in that she&#39;s wearing sunglasses on her face. The print on her torso brick however shows an outfit with flower prints and back pockets to store stuff in.</p>

<p>Shades Unikitty is an interesting looking variant with the same parts as most of the other buildable characters in the line. As a fan of the character you can&#39;t go wrong with more variants of Unikitty, that being said the lack of unique parts made this series tough to collect. Recommended for Fans.</p>
