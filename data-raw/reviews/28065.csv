It appears to be a friendly compromise between a brother and sister who are included in the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I bought this set because I was tired of seeing so many Lego vehicles (City theme) and wanted to try something different without going too expensive (Creator Expert). I have to say I found exactly what I wanted with this set. I really liked the comfy variety of colors such as the blue water, the green grass, the red roof and the white building. The Technic portion of the build (a plunger on the back that enables a hidden treasure chest to be pushed out) to be practical and a worthy addition to the set. I liked the addition of two little beds (one yellow and one blue) to assist with the lived-in feeling of the tree house. I found that moving the tree house a few&nbsp;studs forward allowed for more room to arrange the figures around the back (and made the ladder there a little less precarious). The only vaguely annoying thing about this set is that I kept knocking the little white flag off of the front of the ship (but this is being nitpicky).</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t say that I really found the alternate builds very appealing, but I can say that the ship build inspired me to build my own version of a sloop from the video game Sea of Thieves.</p>

<p>On another note, before buying this set, I was in the process of comparing this tree house with the Lego Friends Mia&#39;s Tree House set (41335). But I found this set at my local WalMart&nbsp;at a really nice Rollback price so I couldn&#39;t pass it up.</p>
