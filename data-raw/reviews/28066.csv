<p>For a set this size three minidolls and five animals was good.&nbsp; It is a pet centre so one would expect quite a few animals.&nbsp; Two were downstairs and the other three were upstairs so well distributed through the centre.</p>

<p>I am always amused that Lego put in an American style fire hydrant whereas in the UK these are underground.</p>

<p>The usual colours that one associates with Friends were evident.&nbsp; I liked the lime and bright light orange canopy at the front of the building.&nbsp; The paw print was a nice touch made up of a dark pink 4x4 circle plate and white round tiles for the paw pad and toes.</p>

<p>The ambulance was quite small with room for one driver and you could just get Lady the poodle in the back.&nbsp; Definitely no room for anything bigger than that!&nbsp; Not quite sure what the thinking was behind having the red warning light on top of the ambulance being able to fold down.</p>

<p>I was intrigued by the archway in the middle for small animals to go through.&nbsp; One would&nbsp;hope that there was some means to block that off at night when the centre was closed.&nbsp; Goodness knows what havoc Mia might have found when she returned the next day.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is the usual level of detail that you get with Friends sets. A good window display with Harry and Bubbles&nbsp;looking out at the people passing by.&nbsp; At the back food to buy, a fish tank and a delightful conveyor belt.&nbsp; I rather enjoyed that, twiddling the red knob to make it move.</p>

<p>Upstairs was for pet pampering and any medical attention that your pet might need.&nbsp; Lady was waiting for her grooming whilst Mini and Mimi were on the seesaw and swing.</p>

<p>For the number of pieces in it this is quite a pricey set.&nbsp; Lego seem to veer between being rather pricey and about right.&nbsp; The quality of their products is, of course, excellent, can&#39;t fault them on that.</p>

<p>This is a great set and one I enjoyed doing and even better&nbsp;if you can find it in a sale.</p>
