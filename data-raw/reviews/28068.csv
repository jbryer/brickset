"Lehofan678","2019-01-19T16:32:59.42Z","Good for a promo","<p>I got this set out of a nat geo kids magazine and i thoroughly enjoyed building it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The magazine itself cost around &pound;4&nbsp;but it was definitely&nbsp;worth it to get that Lego set.</p>

<p>It included the special mosquito print on the 1x2 round transparent piece which was an added bonus and a neat simple way to easily get to it in the build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would recommend buying it but be careful where you but it from because some places sell it for almost &pound;7, but i liked it and i hope you like it too.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Great looking City Minifigure with Blue Tuque and some great printing.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Model is solid and fun to play with as well as quick to build.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Printed cylinder with insect remains included</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">May have benefited from extra Arctic elements to find hidden in the small snow-mound model.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This Polybag was a great little bag and I enjoyed it immensely. I strongly recommend tracking it down for the parts and the fun younger fans will have building and exploring in the Arctic City Theme. Makes a great addition/compliment to any of the larger sets and is a great troop builder for arctic explorers to populate the Arctic region of LEGO City.</p>

"ETH_BAIl","2020-04-20T19:32:19.927Z","A decent polybag, but not anything special by any means.","<p>Pros:</p>

<p>The build uses some pieces in a interesting and useful way.</p>

<p>The pieces included are useful for other things, so it is a &quot;Parts Pack&quot;.</p>

<p>The minifigure in an army builder for an arctic team or something</p>

<p>Affordable</p>

<p>Play feature is easy to play around with.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>Minifigure in generic, but this may be a good thing.</p>

<p>Nothing to special</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final thoughts:</p>

<p>This set has more Pros than Cons, however, the fact that the build is nothing to special weighs it down a little bit. This polybag is a good value for the pieces, the price, and the minifigure. I would rate it a B+</p>
