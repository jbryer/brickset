"A_Brickset_user","2005-12-29T06:58:17Z","Real classic set!!!","One of my first lego sets - I have the european version 363. Old minifigs do match the new one with moving hands and legs! Only lego hospital set with wheelchair! Only lego hospital with back wall - building looks more realistic. Lots of windows and doors - using them you can build plenty of your project buidings. Too bad stickers, except the &quot;hospital&quot; one, did not survive...
And the newest one - 7892 is a parody of a buiding at all!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

From the red corner bricks to the flat 'paving slabs' I've used probably every single brick and board in most of the buildings I've created.  

The paving slabs make great manhole covers! :)

Love these original sets and will probably try to rebuild at some point.

Oh, and the red cross on the roof was a great touch!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>The overall look of the set is great, very reminiscent of the time, lots of windows, and opening doors closed building, no open back.&nbsp; Lots of minifigs (7) and a vehicle in the form of an ambulance.&nbsp; I am not a big fan of the use of stickers, as time would tell the stickers would fade and start to peel up.&nbsp; &nbsp;Without the stickers though the set would not convey the same since completeness as it does.</p>

<p>The build on this set is not overly complicated, the base plate has white dots on it to indicate where to start building the hospital.&nbsp; The set comes with some great pieces like the tiles for the drive way, rounded red bricks for the outside grounds wall and the arches for the ambulance bay.&nbsp; The ambulance is simple but effective, it has room for the patient but not the medics.</p>

<p>The first generation of minifigs are great, I love the look of these guys.&nbsp; With the limitation of the minfigs movement (no arms and legs) this requires disassemble of the figures to get them to sit.&nbsp; The wheel chair and stretcher actually become part of the minfigs to allow for them to interact with the objects, again requiring disassemble and then reassembly.</p>

<p>If you are a collector of 70&rsquo;s era Lego sets or doing a display of sets from this era, then this set is a must.&nbsp; As a child of the 70&rsquo;s I could only imagine owning this set, as an adult I love the fact that it brings back great memories I have of playing with the other sets that I did own back in the day.</p>
