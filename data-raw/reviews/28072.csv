<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soooo this is a review of set 76109 Marvel Super Heroes Ant-Man and the Wasp Quantum Realm Explorers. It contains exactly 200 pieces, 3 minifigs, and retails for $19.99 in the U.S.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All three main characters from Ant-man and the Wasp are included in this $20 set. That is very uncommon for a movie like this. Although this may sound good at first, you may change your mind after seeing the actual figures. Ant-man actually looks pretty good. He has torso AND <strong>LEG</strong> <strong>PRINTING!!!!! </strong>Both of which are actually accurate. His face print is not that great. It is missing his stubble. The helmet is straight up reused from the last Ant-man figure. This is absolutely appalling because&nbsp;there is a huge opening for his mouth.&nbsp;When the first Ant-Man set was released, they based the helmet design off of concept&nbsp;art, which ended up being scrapped.&nbsp;That was understandable&nbsp;in 2015, but to use it AGAIN!? Either way, the dual molding in the helmet looks good and it&#39;s nice to see his eyes through the translucent visor.&nbsp;Wasp is... well... an absolute disaster. The minifigure looks absolutely NOTHING like Wasp&#39;s appearance in the movie. First of all, the <em>design</em> for the torso printing is great. The colors are all wrong. To add insult to injury, she doesn&#39;t have a spec of leg printing. This would have greatly improved the figure. The wings are represented by...&nbsp;of all things...&nbsp;fairy wings. The wings&nbsp;would have lookes SO much better had they been&nbsp;something&nbsp;like&nbsp;the ones&nbsp;used on Space Batman, the Parademons and Poggle the Lesser.(made out of&nbsp;a vinyl type material).&nbsp;The worst part of the entire figure, set, and possibly the entire Marvel Superheroes line, is by far the, what is supposed to be a helmet. It is a reused piece from the &quot;Invincible Iron Man&quot; minifigure. While it may have worked for some figures such as Vulture, it looks horrific on this figure. It is missing basically every single key shape of Wasp&#39;s helmet. It would have been nice for it to have a see-through visor like Ant-Man. Seriously, a knockoff brand could have&nbsp;done a much better job! I just about laugh every time I see it. This is possibly the biggest corner LEGO has&nbsp;cut in recent sets. The&nbsp;face prints are actually pretty good, but a new one would have been preferable. No hair is included.&nbsp;It would have been great to have this option with the helmet being so f***ing bad.&nbsp;If you get this atrocity, I would suggest leaving the helmet off and putting on&nbsp;some black&nbsp;or dark&nbsp;brown hair. Or better yet, create&nbsp;your own custom Wasp&nbsp;figure.&nbsp;Hopefully both the Wasp and Ant-Man will get updated in the Avengers 4 sets.Ghost on the other hand is actually really great. The torso and both&nbsp;face prints are just phenomenal, although as usual there is no leg printing.Continuing with the trend of bad headgear, the hood should be colored&nbsp;in LBG instead of DBG. Simply put, LEGO just didn&#39;t want to recolor it. A new, less baggy hood mold with either physical or printed details would have been wonderful, but I digress. Overall, the hood doesn&#39;t look THAT bad, but is still disappointing.&nbsp;There is also a red vile, a shrink ray gun, and a gold trophy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>On a lighter note, the build for this set is fantastic, especially compared to ones from past Marvel Super Heroes sets. It may not be the most interesting looking thing as far as colors go, but it&#39;s extremely detailed. The cockpit is done ingeniously by using two printed pieces (why do we get printing here and not on minifigure legs?)&nbsp;for the side and a bubble canopy in the middle. You can fit one minifig inside and there are two&nbsp;control sticks, positioned directly&nbsp;behind&nbsp;two little &quot;insect arms&quot;. They can be moved around and can hold bar sized items. The two side pods can be angled independently. It would have been nice to get a mechanism for this, but what can you expect for something so small. I love the engines on the back. There are also two stud shooters, which apparently shoot shrink rays. (clear studs)There are also several stickers used to good effect and they are all easy to apply. Overall, a very fun little build. Possibly one of the best ever in the&nbsp;Marvel Superheros line.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final Verdict:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, not too bad of a set. I feel that this set is worth it just for the build and Ghost figure. Ant-Man is extremely disappointing, and Wasp is flat out one of the worst LEGO minifigures ever made. So, yes, I&nbsp;WOULD recommend it if you can find it for the retail price or below.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my review.</p>

"Anorak719","2018-10-09T01:57:18.75Z","Breaking the Mold","<p>(NO SPOILERS FOR ANT MAN AND THE WASP)</p>

<p>When I say &#39;Breaking the Mold&#39; in the title, it&#39;s usually because the obligatory $20 Marvel set released in June features great figures and a bad/lazy build. In this case, the opposite is true. Let&#39;s dive in.</p>

<p>The Build...</p>

<p>...is one of the best parts about this set. It stays fresh and innovative, while repeating itself a bit, but manages to juggle simplicity with complexity, which is hard. It features a small amount of greebling, which is just enough to replicate the film&#39;s design nearly perfectly. The opening cockpit is great and while it&#39;s smaller than in the movie, I think it works fine. For these reasons, I give the build an easy 4/5.</p>

<p>The Figures...</p>

<p>...are a mixed bag at best.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ant Man</strong>&#39;s figure received criticism last time around due to the open helmet, which was based off of concept art and not the film&#39;s final design. Even though that figure was released 3 years ago, the helmet issue has NOT been addressed! This may not be the worst helmet issue in the set (see&nbsp;<strong>Wasp</strong>) but it&#39;s still awfully annoying. The rest of the figure is fine, using Brendon Thwaites&#39; head from the POTC5 set Silent Mary, and a new torso/legs.</p>

<p><strong>Wasp</strong>&nbsp;is the main source of complaint when it comes to this set, and I see why. The figure barely bears any resemblance to the on-screen counterpart. I know a lot of people have talked about the helmet, so I&#39;ll keep my whining to a minimum, but gosh this is bad. Heck, even reusing <strong>Antman&#39;s</strong> mediocre helmet would have been fine! To add insult to injury, Wasp feature zero leg printing. As the first female character&nbsp;to have her name in the title of a Marvel movie, Wasp deserves better. The unmasked head is a Leia head, which again is confusing because Lego already made a figure with the likeness of Evangeline Lilly (Tauriel, from the Hobbit). Some tweaking would have made it fine to use!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Ghost</strong>&nbsp;is what I believe to be the standout figure in this set. She has no leg printing, but that&#39;s not exactly inaccurate, and the masked head swivels to reveal her exposed face. It&#39;s a small detail, but a welcome one to be sure.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to finish up with a small gripe: the trophy. In the film, it&#39;s small enough to be held comfortably in one hand, and not nearly as wide as the accessory. There is already a suitable existing piece (it came with the Dog Show Host from one of the cmfs) so why not use that? These figures and accesories&nbsp;reek&nbsp;of laziness, and in this case it&#39;s saved by the build. My final score is a 3/5.</p>

"xboxtravis7992","2018-10-10T16:51:20.07Z","Great small sized build (AKA Helmetgate 2018)","<p>This set was Lego&#39;s sole offering for the 2018 film&nbsp;<em>Ant Man and the Wasp</em>. Not unlike the film itself, this set was overshadowed by the larger release waves for Avengers Infinity War and Black Panther. Despite that, Lego released a great model/toy here with some cool building methods; while also managing to irk a large portion of the Lego community with the minifigures. So lets shrink down to scale this set up shall we?<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><em>Ant Man/Scott Lang</em>&nbsp;Our second Lego minifigure incarnation (but fourth if we count the microfig and brickbuilt&nbsp;&#39;Giant Man&#39; from Civil War)&nbsp;of Paul Rudd&#39;s character from the MCU. Guess what? I love this figure. The body print is great, the leg printing is well done and... I love the helmet.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.imgflip.com/o86jz.jpg?a427368"" style=""width: 2000px; height: 1488px;"" /></p>

<p>Yeah I said it. I love the helmet. I know a closed helmet would be more film accurate, but lets also remember that the helmet in the film (usually after Scott Lang returns to normal size) opens up with the chin strap dangling loose revealing part of his face. Sure the faceplate also tends to slide up in the film too&nbsp;when the helmet is opened... but at the end of the day a slightly opened mouth is not the biggest sin Lego could make with this figure. Especially considering its such a beautiful piece (and a rare one at that due to the botched 2015 Ant Man set release), with the dual molding transparent red visor and striping and the crisp molding on the edges. While I know plenty of Lego fans want to see a more screen accurate version, I think this piece will continue to serve fine until Lego gets around to replacing it sometime in the future. If Lego Ant Man wears this same helmet into the Avengers 4 sets, I won&#39;t complain.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And combined with the body printing mentioned earlier, this is were Ant-Man shines. Very recognizable despite the minor liberties taken, and in my opinion one of the best looking Marvel figures released this year. I&#39;d rank him up there with the updated Iron Man, Spider-Man and other figures we got with Infinity War.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>The Wasp</em>&nbsp;And... the next controversial helmet of the set belongs to our following hero, Hope Van Dyne, aka The Wasp. Here, I tend to agree that using the ANAD Iron Man mold was a poor choice for the character. While its serviceable, it lacks the detailing Ant Man has&nbsp;and it sticks out like a sore thumb. Admittedly Lego has re-used this piece before very convincingly (Tron in the Tron Lego Ideas set, and the Vulture in the Spider Man Homecoming wave), but this character deserved better. I wonder if the low price point of the set prevented them from developing a new helmet? At least the helmet&#39;s printing is really good, even if the shape is wrong.&nbsp;With that said to, the wings are another odd choice. They look to fairy like (Tinker-Bell uses the same wings in the Disney Castle and I can&#39;t unsee the fact the same mold is used for the Wasp). Didn&#39;t Lego have some more <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=11599&amp;idColor=108#T=C&amp;C=108"">mechanical/insect wings</a>&nbsp;they used in a Galaxy Squad a few years back that would have been a better fit here? I wonder if those old molds were retired and couldn&#39;t be used here; or if the fact they are two wings made Lego think the more rounded but four wing fairy mold was more accurate?<br />
<br />
With that said, a lot of my issues with the figure stem from my issues with the movie design itself... The dark blue and muted yellow just doesn&#39;t capture Wasp&#39;s comic design with its brighter yellow and dark black colors. Heck, comic book Wasp just skips the infamous&nbsp;helmet altogether in most depictions:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://lumiere-a.akamaihd.net/v1/images/usa_avengers_skchi_wasp_n_6d4fae68.png?region=0%2C0%2C400%2C400"" style=""width: 400px; height: 400px;"" /></p>

<p>But this nitpick again is more about the film itself... Lego wasn&#39;t the one in charge of deciding how the character would look on screen. Other than a new helmet mold and choosing the other wing mold instead of the blue fairy wings... I can&#39;t think of how Lego could have really done better with the design as we saw it in the film; since even leg printing would have only added some pin striping detail and not much else. Personally, here&#39;s me hoping a comic accurate Wasp figure is made in the future so I can just replace the MCU figure with it, because overall I just think the MCU costume is a bit bland.</p>

<p><br />
<em>Ghost</em>, To be honest... most of my memories of the character from the film revolve around her father&#39;s failed experiment in Buenos Aires (is that Argentina&#39;s first MCU appearance? I lived in Argentina for two years so the mention of it on screen caught my eye). Ghost was one of the most surprising characters in the film. Its been out long enough that I think I can freely speak of spoilers here, but I liked how despite being set up as &#39;the villain&#39; in marketing and trailers; she was then revealed to be more of a tortured soul at the end of it all who becomes an ally of the main heroes at story&#39;s end. The figure has a double-sided head, with the mask on one side and the character&#39;s face printed on the other (oddly not to dissimilar to the Batgirl faces used in Lego Batman). Again the torso print is pretty good. I think the omission of leg printing here is more of a mistake than the omission on The Wasp, since the Ghost costume in the film has some intricate textures running up the legs which would have looked great in Lego.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Now lets wash all opinions on the figures aside and focus on the real meat of the set, the actual build itself! Now this is a fun straight forward build, with lots of cool greebling details and some interesting SNOT work. I&#39;d rank it as one of the most entertaining Marvel Super Heroes builds this year due to the greeble working all over the model.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>The Finished Model</strong></p>

<p>Once finished, the Quantum Realm Explorer Pod... thing; is just a great little model. Its small and compact, but as I mentioned earlier the greebles on this thing are insane. This is a very screen accurate model with rather proper scaling, the only major difference being the pod only seats one figure instead of two people like in the film. There are some stud shooters, which while I don&#39;t really care for them they are placed in a spot which does not detract from the finished model.The small side thrusters rest on little &#39;wings&#39; connected to the body via Mixel&#39;s joints, and can be angled in and out of the model; while the front grabber arms have some range of motion up and down. The orb shaped cockpit uses a few pieces to give the illusion it is a full sphere, and looks great when closed. There are a&nbsp;few side pieces included, some futuristic quantum gun thing which looks good, a red bottle of quantum energy and a trophy piece which really doesn&#39;t look like anything I remember from the movie but isn&#39;t an unwelcome addition to the set.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So in conclusion... I think this set is an abject lesson into how the minifigure centric collection view a lot of AFOL&#39;s have can sometimes blind us to the building and display aspects of Lego. I agree, The Wasp looks pretty boring with the bland helmet and generic looking designs. Was that enough reason to keep me from purchasing the set? No, this is a great model and the three figures all combine to recreate a good sense of the scenes from the film. In an ideal world I do wish The Wasp turned out better than we got, and perhaps Lego could have done a second set for the film with the &#39;Ant-Van&#39;, the sleazy gangster guy (who was sort of the film&#39;s real villain), Goliath/Dr. Foster and Luis (like really Lego, everybody loves Luis if you make him a SDCC exclusive or something dumb like that I swear...). Its also a pity an updated Hank Pym or Janet Van Dyne couldn&#39;t be included in the set somehow, especially since Hank and Janet are the ones who actually use the pod in the film. Yet considering Lego&#39;s busy Marvel schedule for 2018 giving us only one single set for this film I think this was a decent pick in both the model itself and the characters included. I do suspect that the Black Panther and Infinity War sets drew a lot of production focus away from Ant Man and the Wasp sadly; and I wonder if the lack of new helmets in this set is somehow related to the team working on new pieces for the other films.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yes, the lackluster figure department keeps this from being a truly standout set, but I think the build and play features alone makes this a solid four star model. The build really is fun and the finished pod is such a great display piece I fear many AFOL&#39;s are missing out on it just because they don&#39;t like the figures. I&nbsp;recommend picking it up for any Lego Marvel fan; and I have my finger&#39;s crossed that future sets will release improved iterations of the characters seen here.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Now that the home video release is out I got to rewatch the film and I have a few small things to add... First, turns out the Wasp&#39;s outfit in the film is closer to a black and yellow than a dark blue and yellow... so Lego could have theoretically done the figure in black and given us that more comic accurate look.<br />
<br />
Second, I think the trophy piece is a reference to the &quot;World&#39;s Greatest Grandma&quot; trophy that hid Ant-Man&#39;s spare suit... Would have looked more in scale had it been a smaller trophy, but its a funny inclusion now that I recognize it.&nbsp;<br />

"Faefrost","2019-02-16T06:07:52.897Z","A strange little set. Fun to build but not much past that","<p>This is a hard set to characterize. It&#39;s a small set. With a single main vehicle build and 3 minifigs. The vehicle is surprisingly the high point.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions - Pretty Standard Marvel red box. Standard stuffed and mangled instruction books. Very small sticker sheet for some details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs - The main draw of the set, also the weakest element.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ant-Man - The best fig in the set. Dual Torso printing, Leg printing. Dual head. The Ant Man helmet is however not correct for the movie. Still looks decent.</p>

<p>Wasp - Ugh! This is the first time we have gotten a Wasp figure. She should be great. Instead she is half arsed. She has torso printing. No leg printing. So her outfit which should run down to her legs cuts off half way. She has a double sided head with 2 faces. Why? They don&#39;t include a hairpiece? Instead we get a new single piece Iron Man helmet with some vaguely wasp like printing on the front. It looks awful. And they gave her the CMF Fairy Wings. Instead of the more tech looking wing piece. The helmet is just wrong. The wings are wrong. The figure is wrong. Bah!</p>

<p>Ghost - Not half bad, but not quite good either. Like Wasp she only has a dual printed torso. Just plain light bley legs. Her head is a base light bley, with her Ghost mask on one side, and her face peeking out through a mask on the other. The flesh colored printing over the darker color is as usual awful. It&#39;s also weird as Ghost never looked like that. Her mask was either on, or off. But not surrounding her exposed face. She has a dark bley hood, which also feels off. She needed a matching Light Bley one. Or better yet a bare head with hair and the new scarf piece used by Lucy in the Lego Movie 2 sets. Ghost is okay, but could have been better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts - This set is a greebler&#39;s delight. Lots of little odd detail parts in bley, light bley, gold etc. Gold Roller skates stand out. Some really neat printed canopy pieces that form a near full bubble.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build/Model - The build is where this set shines. It is a master class lesson in greebling and adding industrial detail. And they use every trick. The completed model looks great, in a sort of industrial trash heap kind of way. It&#39;s vaguely swooshable, but the most fun with it is building it. You will learn a lot of neat tricks building this one. After that?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overview - A nice $19 set. A fun learning build. Some better detailing on the figs or a fourth figure (Janet or Hank Pym) would have made the difference. Worth getting, but you will enjoy it. Build it. Them render it for parts on a much bigger super detail part.&nbsp;</p>

"Helichopter21","2019-03-15T00:57:31.003Z","Great Build, Disappointing Minifigs","<p>This was the only set released for the <em>Ant-Man and the Wasp </em>movie, and because I did not purchase the set from the&nbsp;<em>Ant-Man&nbsp;</em>movie, I did not get an Ant-Man figure, which is why this set appealed to me when it was first revealed. However, some of the other&nbsp;minifigures that were included (Wasp in particular) disappointed me, and that is the main problem with this set, in my opinion.</p>

<p><strong>The Build and Parts:</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s a pretty standard build process. The whole craft is situated on a helicopter landing skid piece. Other pieces, such as the printed canopy pieces on the sides of the cockpit, are&nbsp;interesting, and there are several nice pieces in colors such as gray and black that could prove useful in MOCs.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigs:</strong></p>

<p>Three minifigures are included: Ant-Man, the Wasp, and Ghost. The Ant-Man figure has different torso and leg prints than&nbsp;the original, but the helmet is the same as the one from the 2015 set. I like the printing, and while the helmet may not be entirely accurate&nbsp;to the source material, the dual molding looks great, and it is a good mold as well. Even though it is not entirely accurate to the helmet in the movie, I have no problems with this figure and am glad to finally own an Ant-Man minifig.</p>

<p>Ghost is not a particularly great minifig, but it is okay. The torso printing is rather good, and the head printing for the mask looks great. I appreciate that Ghost&#39;s face is visible on the other side of the head. However, I wish the legs were printed, and I think the hood piece should have been done in light bluish gray to make the figure more accurate to the source material. Ghost also gets some power blast pieces, which I think work well. Overall, this is a decent minifig.</p>

<p>This is where the set loses its five star rating for me: the Wasp minifig. This figure is just done poorly. I don&#39;t think the color for the torso and legs is entirely accurate to the source material, but I think that it is probably the closest available color it could be to match the movie. The printing on the torso is okay, but it makes the figure look almost like a comic book variant of the character. Like the Ghost minifig, I wish the legs were printed. However, my main issue with the figure is the helmet. Lego keeps trying to use the same helmet mold in interesting ways, and in some cases, it has worked. However, that is not the case here. The mold is not suited to the Wasp&#39;s helmet at all, and while you can still tell who the figure represents, it just isn&#39;t good. Printing tries to cover it up, and I actually think the quality of print on the helmet is good, but the helmet does not suit Wasp&#39;s helmet in the movie. What bothers me more is that Lego released a new helmet mold for Firefly in a 2019 DC Super Heroes set. I don&#39;t understand why they didn&#39;t just release the mold early for Wasp in a different color with different printing, as it is much more suitable to the character. Fortunately, this mold is now being used for Ant-Man in an&nbsp;<em>Avengers:&nbsp;</em><em>Endgame</em>&nbsp;set, so hopefully if&nbsp;Wasp returns to the MCU, we will get an updated figure.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Build:</strong></p>

<p>The completed Quantum Realm vehicle looks really good to me. The design for the canopy looks fantastic, and I appreciate the printed pieces used on the side. There is nice detailing throughout the model done primarily&nbsp;through greebling, and the model resembles the source material very accurately. There are stud shooters on the front, but they don&#39;t stand out too much, as the studs are clear. However, this creates a play issue, as hunting down the studs after firing them will be even more difficult for kids, should they choose to use that feature. The vehicle seats a figure well, and there are some adjustable arms on the front, which also work well.&nbsp;The exhaust port builds on the side of the model are attached using ball joints, so they can be rotated around. Also included in the set are a tube of quantum energy, a quantum gun,&nbsp;and the World&#39;s Best Grandma trophy from the movie. This trophy is not printed, but it&#39;s a nice touch.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>Despite the terrible Wasp figure, I still feel that this set is successful. The other two figures are decent, and the build looks and plays well. It is also accurate to the craft in the movie, so that should please Marvel fans. In terms of accuracy to the scene in the movie, other minifigs should be included, such as Hank Pym and Janet van Dyne. I think a second set, likely based on the car chase scene, should have been made, and it could have included some of the minifigs in this set. However, since only one set was made for this movie, I am glad that all three of the main characters are included in a relatively cheap set. This is great for both kids and adults, as young fans of Ant-Man will be able to get all the main characters from the movie in one cheap set, and adult minifigure collectors won&#39;t have to spend lots of money on a big set just to collect a minifigure.&nbsp;The price seems reasonable, at least in the U.S., so I would recommend this to most Marvel fans. The only people who I feel will be disappointed by this set are those focused on collecting the minfigures, as the Wasp minifig is extremely disappointing. Those who are concerned about movie accuracy may also be disappointed by Ant-Man&#39;s helmet as well.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The build is really good and accurate to the movie. It was fun to build with great detail and has ok playability. There are stud shooters on the bottom sides that are not that noticeable. The sides of the cockpit are printed pieces and can open.&nbsp;There are two little arms on the front that can move and can hold stuff. The thrusters on the sides of the build can move around. Overall the build looks good for display and ok playability. 10/10</p>

<p>This set has a great build but the minifigures are a little inaccurate. Even though there are inaccuracies with the minifigures I still think this set is worth the price.

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The set is shown off very well. The instructions of LEGO models have been predominantly decent, the only sets I ever had issues with was the original LEGO Batman sets I bought because the pictures for construction were very hard to make out.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Some of the sets I&rsquo;ve been building of late have begun to share an issue similar with colours and manuals being too dark to fully make out what piece is being used. Fortunately this set doesn&rsquo;t do that.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A sticker sheet is always found in most Marvel sets, this one is no different.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Cylinders, Bricks, Plates and Tiles, everything found commonly in LEGO sets is included here. Two printed cockpit window sections are included and this set does not feature the new energy elements from the Infinity War sets. It does have some gold roller skates though, if you want your Minifigures to have gold roller skates.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ant-Man: What an excellent looking print. Ant-Man has an awesome appearance with the red, black and silver/grey suit there is a load of printed detailing on his torso and legs. He&rsquo;s got a pretty impressive helmet piece too, it looks really cool. His facial print is dual-sided with the smirking Scott Lang face and a terrified expression. He comes with a gun accessory of some kind, which may or may not involve collecting Pym Particles or Quantum Realm Juice or shrinking things&hellip; I haven&rsquo;t seen the movie in so long I can&rsquo;t remember what kind of gadget they had.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ghost: Here is another excellent print, love the tech detailing of her suit and the fancy gadgets on her torso and back that look almost like energy injectors or stabilizers. She has a standard hood over her face, and her face is terrifying. She&rsquo;s got piercing red glowing eyes and a faceless mask with no visible mouth. Turn her head around and you reveal the human beneath. Give her those flick-fire accessories and she can shoot energy at Ant-Man and The Wasp.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Wasp: Compared to Ant-Man and Ghost, Wasp is a tad plainer in appearance. Her helmet is not a unique sculpt, but the single piece helmet they&rsquo;ve been using for Iron Man in Marvel Comic and Animation inspired sets. This is printed with the design of her actual helmet&hellip; Honestly they should have just made another new sculpt, Wasp has such an interesting looking helmet the plain grey blob with print just can&rsquo;t compare.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Her torso has some nice printing though. Beneath the helmet you&rsquo;ll find a smiling expression and an irritated expression, she&rsquo;s really not amused with Scott&rsquo;s jokes. No accessories, and no alternate hair piece so you can actually have her without her helmet on. Kind of unfortunate that.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Ant-Man helps you build the lower section of the Quantum Realm exploration craft seen and used in the film. This section is a nice little build. Some stickers are placed on certain elements, but shouldn&rsquo;t be too hard to get set properly when applied. There really isn&rsquo;t much else to say just yet.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: The Wasp and Ghost team up to complete the bubble cockpit, walls/sides and engines of the Quantum Realm exploration craft. There is a lot of mirrored building in this selection of parts because you&rsquo;re making two sides of the same model. The bubble cockpit was slightly frustrating as I was building it, it liked to pop out of alignment at the slightest provocation, but once the model was finished it didn&rsquo;t move around as much.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is just all kinds of simplistic fun, this model doesn&rsquo;t feature anything too outlandish. It&rsquo;s basically a model that represents a ship used to travel into the Quantum Realm and is cute, accurate to the on-screen model. It has two stud shooters, but no outlandish or model disrupting play features, the skate element is used for a lot of detailing in silver and gold and some of the LEGO bucket elements are looking great as part of the engines.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a great 25$ set, it includes a decent selection of Minifigures and the model is just awesome, love the detailing here and the ball cockpit works so great. Simple use of stickers is also a very appreciated decision. You really can&rsquo;t go wrong with the twenty-five dollar price point. Not a whole lot to discuss honestly, the set is pretty simple in design and execution, just need to finish by saying. Recommended.</p>
