<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. Buy the y-wing&nbsp;over May the Fourth weekend</p>

<p>2. Have already purchased a Millennium&nbsp;Falcon before Dec. 31 (have the black VIP card)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was told by Lego CS that a promotional code for the poster was sent on&nbsp;May 2nd. I didn&#39;t get the email or a code but Lego CS was able to ship me the poster based on my account purchases.</p>

<p>*UPDATE*</p>

<p>This didn&#39;t seem to be helping people based on the feedback so let me shed some more light on the item at hand.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The poster measures 11&quot; long and 8.5&quot; wide, for easy reference it is the size of standard piece of paper. I am not sure how to compare the weight of the paper,&nbsp;maybe a light postcard. It was smaller than I had expected but that will make it easy to find a frame. I was a little disappointed in the packing, it was in a flimsy envelope with no real protection for the poster (mine&nbsp;had a small crease in the corner). Placing it between two pieces of cardboard would be much appreciated(and make them BIGGER). I really like the idea of the schematics and hope to see Lego&nbsp;do the same with other UCS models in the future.&nbsp;</p>
