I found this at Toy&rsquo;s-R-Us in Canada, I suspect it may be made available as a free gift during Bricktober, though I wouldn&rsquo;t be sure on that. Still it&rsquo;s a nice little companion piece to the larger Roller Coaster set. (Which I have not picked up yet, so I can&rsquo;t be sure if this wagon will fit on the Roller Coaster Tracks.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Unikitty has a nice wide-eyed facial print with a smile and fits solidly into the model.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Roller Coaster Wagon is a great looking model that features a disc launcher first introduced in the Legends of Chima theme.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Build is fun and easy to construct and play with.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Not yet easy to find.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Model may or may not fit on the roller coaster track.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Disc launcher is odd play feature to include with Unikitty.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">If you&rsquo;re a fan of Unikitty I&rsquo;d definitely recommend this set as it does feature some great simplistic design choices and is very fun to build and play with. Unikitty also features a nice new facial print and her new model design makes her head attachment much more solid. Recommended.</p>

<p>Meh building experience. Weak parts. Ok playability. Not really good price, as there are better ways to get Unikitty than a roller coaster&nbsp;&nbsp;wagon.&nbsp;</p>
