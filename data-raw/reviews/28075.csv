I haven&rsquo;t picked up The Flash yet, and it also isn&rsquo;t in the database, however this film was a must have because it continues the tradition of including a Minifigure, as opposed to some of the other films that did not include any new Minifigures.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Presentation</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The special version which includes the Minifigure is packaged in a box which showcases many of the characters in a very nice looking image that really captures the fun of these LEGO films. The write-up is very straight forward, and the package includes a Blu-Ray disc and a DVD with images tampographed onto the top of Aquaman.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The menu is the same as past LEGO DC specials and you will see a trailer for LEGO The Flash and Teen Titans Go to The Movies before getting to the main menu.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigure</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Green Lantern Jessica Cruz is a brand new polybagged figure included with the set. I will cover the Minifigure in a separate review, the Polybag is packaged inside of its own special sleeve inside the box to prevent it from sliding around loose.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Contents</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is an hour and 19 minutes at most and is very well put together. There is still some of the clever humor found in past LEGO specials, however this one is a bit more serious in nature. The story is very well made and there isn&rsquo;t as much reference to the LEGO world like we saw in earlier specials. No jokes or references to anything like 2x2 bricks or things to that effect.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The special showcases the 2018 sets, specifically we get to see the Lobo set referenced as Lobo appears. I don&rsquo;t believe any other sets are featured, at least I haven&rsquo;t heard of any new Aquaman sets being released outside of the SDCC exclusive or the one based on the cinematic feature. So we probably won&rsquo;t be seeing physical versions of Atrocitus, Ocean Master, Mera or anyone else DC specific. Background characters that appear in here use models seen in LEGO Space Police 3 and Alien Conquest, so if you have sets from those Themes you can use them with your DC figures if you&rsquo;d prefer.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There are no other shorts or bonus material with this release. Past films included at least another WB cartoon episode from the DC universe or a short behind-the-scenes featurette. Unfortunately it would appear these are no longer included so you&rsquo;re getting some pretty bare bones content aside from the main special.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This film was actually quite entertaining, it tells a very nice story and focuses a lot more on Aquaman compared to the earlier specials that were more Batman centric. The special boxed edition includes a bonus Minifigure representing a new character in this very special, and the price is fairly decent as well as it is only 20$ for a blu-ray, dvd and digital release. If you&rsquo;ve collected and enjoyed the specials previously this one is a very worthy addition, I do wish there was a bit more to it, a commentary track or something else to do aside from the main special, but I still strongly recommend this release as a fan of LEGO DC. Compared to the Gotham Break Out special I reviewed last this one is leaps better as a coherent story and doesn&rsquo;t introduce too many silly elements.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Strongly Recommended.</p>
