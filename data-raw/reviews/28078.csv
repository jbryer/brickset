"VerMonster","2018-12-12T03:55:03.05Z","Komainu for your ninja and samurai!","<p>I&#39;d given up on finding these, but it appears Walmart has them in limited quantities for the holiday assortment. So I picked up a number of them.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with the minifigure. The hunter is just how he looks on the packaging. The head is single faced, but the face is well designed with a mask and orange eyes. He is clearly a bad man. The torso is printed front and back with a very Mad Max-ish&nbsp;pattern of belts and straps mostly in grey but with orange highlights. The legs are printed with a similar pattern- I&#39;m impressed they did printed legs on a polybag. The accessories are a brown conical hat and the ubiquitous stud shooter pistol. Unlike the Star Wars sets I see it with usually, this is by the instructions using an orange stud. Overall, he&#39;s a good mook&nbsp;kind of minifig.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, the real call of this set is the dragon. It&#39;s clearly styled after a Buddist&nbsp;temple guardian lion-dog (shi-shi in Chinese, or komainu in Japanese). It is white, very white, and built around five ball joints. This makes it very posable. The hind legs are short, but if they weren&#39;t they would get in the way of the forelegs. This leads to the dragon being in a crouch most of the time. The tail is just a simple Exo-force droid arm, clipped to the bar at the back of the torso. The dragon&#39;s head is on the angular side and uses blue studs for eyes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The use of Nexo sword/spear blades on the forelimbs and in trans blue as the tip of the tail is a bit curious to me. I&#39;m not a fan of this blade as it&#39;s very flimsy in my experience, But also, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen it in Ninjago before. As a result, when I put together the second (komainu&nbsp;are always in pairs, at either side of the temple gate), not only did I use the trans orange studs intended to be used with the shooter as eyes, I used a pair of gold katanas on the forelegs and a sai for the tail which is more in keeping with the usual Ninjago&nbsp;look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other than that one minor quibble, I have no real complaints about this model. They&#39;re low cost, but nicely designed. I give these high points for playability, capable of being posed in many positions and it always looks like it just wants to pounce someone who needs it. You could also very easily leave the 2x2 slope off, and could have minifig&nbsp;sitting on it&#39;s back. A ninja master (or Jedi) riding into combat on the back of a semi-feline dragon really is as over the top as it gets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you can find them, get a few.&nbsp;</p>

"vikings","2018-12-27T19:49:59.63Z","Great pieces for such a small set. ","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The bag is the larger&nbsp;polybag&nbsp;bag. The instructions are also a little larger as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The piece selection in this polybag is really good. You get some mini sword blades (two silver and one trans blue). You also get a white boomerang. The total piece count for the set is 61.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>The only figure you get in the set is just a Dragon Hunter. The hat is really cool and is the first one I have owned. The detail on him is really good with the chain and all the different colors on him. He also comes with the stud shooter equipped with one trans-clear orange stud.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The build was really easy took me under two minutes to build it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:</strong></p>

<p>Once it was finished I was really pleased with the set. The figure is really good. My only critique would be the dragon&#39;s head isn&#39;t the best in my opinion (It is a mini version of the large one so it may just be me) but other than that it is great. I thought I would have problems with the legs but they work much better than I thought they would with positioning&nbsp;it and all of that.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice little Ninjago&nbsp;polybag. The figure is good and the amount of unique pieces you get for such a small set is really nice. The dragon itself is also really nice. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Master_Wu","2019-03-19T23:12:00.353Z","To The Hunt!","<p>This awesome little dragon hunter polybag&nbsp;is a fun set. It includes as shown on the bag: 1 dragon hunter minifigure&nbsp;and 1dragon. This set is a good purchase and fun to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Dragon:</p>

<p>I think the dragon is a cool brick-built creature however it doesn&#39;t really look like a dragon. It was fun to build though and it may not look like&nbsp;a dragon, but it&#39;s something to hunt!</p>

<p>The Hunter:</p>

<p>I bought this set primarily for the minifigure&nbsp;and you&#39;ll see why. Set&#39;s like these are usually good for the minifigures&nbsp;and this is no exception. The hunter has a cool hat and a stud-shooting gun. He looks cool and is a good minifigure to add to a collection.&nbsp;</p>
