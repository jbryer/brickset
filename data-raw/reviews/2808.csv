I like Model Team sets and this one is a good one.

There are not a lot of feature, but the direction works fine.

The look is cool and it has a lot of details.

It was very funny to built it and it's a pleasure to play with it.

The only thing that I regret is that there are not chromium parts like on some other Model Team sets.

If you find it for a good price, don't hesitate to buy it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The base van is so easy to manipulate and modify. It also has a great are for storage inside of it, including a battery box. I even managed to motorise it with technic parts and added system lights and make a cool (though slow haha) ambulance.<br><p><br></p>The base model is also very solid, I used to set up rally stages for it to get around, push it over jumps and the like, it was great to see it roll on a corner with all the little details fly off it, but still retain its structural integrity.<br><p><br></p><p>The alternative model is OK, but not nearly as fun, or durable. The stickers sadly suffer the same as all model teams, especially the large ""CUSTOM"" ones on the side as these spread over several pieces.</p><p><br></p><p>Overall, I would recommend this to fans of Model Team, customising, Technic and people who like pushing lego vehicles over ramps to see how much punishment it can take.<br></p><br>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"carlosfsm","2014-05-04T01:57:24.74Z","OMG! This was great to crash!","<p>I remember that some one gave me this set as a present. I didn&#39;t like it very much sometimes because this wasn&#39;t playable as the other sets I had with the minifigures and stuff. Also, the scale of course didn&#39;t help for that purpose.</p>

<p>Even though, it was a great set to display in my room and I had lots of fun with it playing around with it (without messing with my other sets). I remember that the wheel on the roof worked as the steering wheel and it had a good precision, so I could be running around and using that wheel on the roof to push and steer at the same time.</p>

<p>The best fun was to push the van over a one-step that we had between the hall and the living room so that the van would flip over and roll many times as it would rip apart in many pieces. I loved to see it get destroyed. It was a spectacular wreck!</p>

<p>Many of the parts were handy when building different things.</p>

<p>Like any other&nbsp;<em>Model Team</em>&nbsp;set, it was fun and challenging to assemble it. But you knew the end result would be awesome. And indeed it was.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is very detailed, and it has many useful parts, not that you would ever want to disassemble it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is rather large for the standard Lego minifigures, but if you have some&nbsp;<em>Technic</em>&nbsp;figures it doubles the playing experience.</p>

<p>Even just to look at, it&#39;s very attractive by itself.</p>
