Not only because of the little dinosaur you otherwise only can get by purchasing expensive sets, but because of the useful parts/new pieces that come along with it. Especially the new leaf-piece and those eight 1x1 plates w. up right holder (Design 15712) in brown drew my attention to this &quot;magazine-toy&quot;.</p>

<p>The completed model looks really nice. It&#39;s a good idea to build up a nest like this. And the little dinosaur really looks like he cannot await his brothers and sisters to break through their eggshells and have a run with him.</p>

<p>By the way: with set 75932 you can get an adult version of a raptor in that color scheme.</p>

<p>The building was really&nbsp;simple, just few steps. It&nbsp;wasn&#39;t anything special. It contains few pieces&nbsp;so there can&#39;t be any super unique building technics, but the way they designed nest is for me perfect.The parts in this set are nice too. Some plants, which are very useful, eggs, bone, 6x6 wedge plate in unique, dark tan color. And of course dino. Before buying this set I expect something&nbsp;little bit bigger. It&#39;s just tiny. But both mold of it and the beautiful&nbsp;prints makes him a great fig. You can of course play with this set, especially when you have some more, bigger dinosaurs, but for me it is just a standing little scene. It can be use for a perfect addition to Jurassic World display.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this is a really cool set. It cost only 15 PLN&nbsp;(~4$). It is worth this price. Nice parts, great dinosaur, good look, make this set worth four stars.</p>

"lkb57","2018-10-19T17:50:40.31Z","Baby Raptors Everywhere!","<p>The 2018 Jurassic World line introduced the new baby velociraptor&nbsp;part, which comes in two different color schemes: <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-38728"">a blue/green version</a> that represents the velociraptor character Blue as a baby, and <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6225624/animal-no-47"">a brown/orange version</a> that is supposed to a generic version of the velociraptors. At the moment, aside from this foil bag the brown/orange baby velociraptor only comes in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-design-38524"">two other relatively expensive sets</a>, so if you can get your hands on it, this foil bag is a relatively inexpensive way of adding the little guy to your dino collection. However, if you&#39;re a Yank like me, actually getting this set requires a Bricklink purchase, since it was only available in Europe. It was released as a promo gift along with the first issue of the Lego Jurassic World Magazine, which I was unfortunately not able to get. That being said, this little set was definitely worth the purchase.</p>

<p>In addition to the adorable baby raptor, this set also includes some other pieces I was excited to acquire: the relatively new <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-24946"">egg piece</a> (first introduce in 2016), the<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6229130/plant-w-plate-1x1-no-1""> green 1X1 round plate with three leaves</a>, and <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-24855"">this stem piece</a>. The inclusion of these pieces and the baby raptor were the main draw for me, and is why I&#39;d give this set a 5 out of 5, even though obtaining the set on the aftermarket was relatively expensive and the build itself is nothing special.</p>

<p>Having never purchased a foil pack before, I was surprised to find that there are no included instructions . . . you just base your build off the photo on the front of the pack. Luckily this wasn&#39;t hard (the set only has ~22 pieces).</p>

<p>Aftermarket price aside, this set was everything I was hoping for. The raptor baby makes a great addition to my dinosaur collection, and the eggs and plant pieces will help flesh out any dinosaur jungle scene. If you&#39;re a Jurassic World or dinosaur collector hoping to get a hold of the brown/orange raptor, I would highly recommend grabbing this set as it will cost you far less than the other options.</p>
