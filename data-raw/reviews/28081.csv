"Master_Wu","2019-07-18T16:51:27.82Z","Very nice!","<p>This is a very nice seasonal set! It&#39;s a fun build with some great colors. The three cars attach. The engine is a very nice build which attaches to the freight&nbsp;car. This car holds some things that look like&nbsp;presents. The freight car attaches to the caboose. The caboose is rather cubish but I think it still looks very nice!</p>

<p>I recommend this set for the holidays!</p>

"Lego_fan_","2020-01-16T04:20:38.43Z","A Holiday train","<p>Lego set #30543 is a great addition to any Lego holiday collection and is a great way to make your room feel more playful during the holidays.</p>

<p>This set is about three or four inches long, can be pushed, and has some neat details.</p>

<p>The train comes in three sections; the train engine, the freight car, and the caboose.</p>

<p>The train engine is about an inch and a half long and has a nice roof overhanging the back part a little bit. It also has a snow clearer in the front, a smoke stack, and a car connector.</p>

<p>The freight car is about maybe an inch long and has car connectors in the front and back, has room for cargo inside, and it even includes two presents to put into it.</p>

<p>The caboose is about an inch and well and has car connectors in the front and back. It also has some windows to make it look like their is an inside to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The train can be extended when you either buy more of this set, or you build more cars. Also you can build a track for it like i did.</p>

<p>Overall i think that this set is a must have for any holiday collector, or person who wants to make a room more playful around the holidays.</p>

<p>Comes in a polybag with normal size polybag instructions</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>There aren&#39;t any cool or unique parts in the set. The few dark green pieces are nice. The wheels are also neat and work great.&nbsp;The total piece count is 66.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy and took me a few minutes build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice little train. You get three cars: The engine, freight car,&nbsp;and caboose. All three connect to one another. The design allows the train to move smoothly.&nbsp;They all look very good and do a nice job of representing the Christmas theme. I recommend this to anyone (especially if you are&nbsp;into holiday theme Lego sets). Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
