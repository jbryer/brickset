<p>I bought this for &pound;11.99 discounted, at the opening of a new Smyths toy store using a promotional voucher. As much as I like the set, I also like a good deal, so waited to get this one at a cheaper price that I thought was fair and adequate. Believe me, from experience these sets go down in price, so avoid it at full price if you can.</p>

<p>Besides this grudge, the set made for a relaxing, 20-30 min build in front of the latest episode of Channel 4&#39;s &#39;Lego Masters&#39;! The shaping on Ron&#39;s hair was interesting and clever, the attachment of Dumbledore&#39;s beard surprised me in how well hidden it was, the decorated tiles were all printed and the sets look great when complete. I have a small collection of BrickHeadz who live together in my room, so I have kept these two with them. The set contains minimal repetition of building small subparts, and works with bricks going in all directions.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>- Fun build</p>

<p>- Good looking for display</p>

<p>- Interesting and useful pieces (printed tiles, glasses, jumper, etc)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>- Not enough to justify the full price</p>

<p>- Cannot be played with (but this is the same across the whole theme, so only targeted at those who would use it as a toy)</p>
