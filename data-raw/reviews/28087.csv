<p>The Hogwarts Express is one of the iconic elements of the Harry Potter series, and this is the 4th rendition of it in &#39;play set&#39; scale; previous versions have been released in 2001, 2004, 2010 and 2018. It is also the biggest version (by piece count). The big difference with this set is that it has much more of background - this seems to&nbsp;the first actual rendition of Platform 9 3/4. Based on the included minifigures&nbsp;and stickers, this set fits the departure of the Hogwarts Express from Kings Cross Station at the beginning of the Prisoner of Azkaban (the third book in the Harry Potter series).</p>

<p>The train is well detailed and looks quite well finished. The wagon is cramped, but the cart and the trolley witch do fit. So does the Dementor. The steam engine of the Hogwarts Express looks the best of all of the previous versions, though I do miss a driver (though one never appears in the movie).</p>

<p>The 6&nbsp;minifigures are excellent, and all but Harry and Ron are actually unique to this set.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is a very good set, arguably the best of the &#39;normal&#39; wave of 2018 Harry Potter sets. I would definitely rank it above the <strong>Hogwarts Great Hall (set 75954)</strong>. It also offers quite good value for money, with the 6 minifigures, the fairly big and complicated pieces, and it being part of a licensed theme.&nbsp;If you want to save for one of the three big Harry Potter sets of 2018, this one is definitely worthy of consideration.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build experience is ok to good, not great, IMHO. It takes about 2 hours or so to build this set. Take care of stickers, as they definitely add something to the appeal, but because of that them being applied crookedly will be highly noticeable. The construction itself is very simple, and people much younger than 8 should be able to build this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The construction of the 9 3/4 platform is fairly simple and effective. I would have liked to see it reach a little higher though. The construction of the engine is fairly simple, with some nice but not special construction techniques used. I liked the construction of the boiler. The passenger carriage has a very simple construction as well, with the compartment-like structures effectively done - though they are not full compartments.</p>

<p>There are few very special pieces. Most related to the train (the undercarriage parts) as well as printed name-plates and the front door/dome of the boiler.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are six minifigures in this set. Harry and Ron can also be found in <strong>Aragog&#39;s Lair (set 75950)</strong>. They both have two facial expressions, one calm and friendly, one fearful - which is more appropriate for facing Aragog than the included Dementor&nbsp;- as they seem to be screaming in terror.&nbsp;Ron also has his cart,&nbsp;which carries Scabbers. None of them are clothed in their school uniforms.</p>

<p>The Hermione Granger minifigure is unique, and just as Harry and Ron has the short legs. She also has two face prints, but in contrast to Ron and Harry, I think her alternate facial expression is more suited for an encounter with a Dementor. I am saddened that Crookshanks is not included in this set.</p>

<p>The Dementor figure is well done, with the bottom a dual-moulded&nbsp;piece like the ones used in the Ninjago&nbsp;&#39;Possession&#39;-wave&nbsp;sets to depict the wraiths. Only instead of blue and trans-yellow they are transparent and black. I like the cape. He has an all-black face, with the mouth opened to suck out someone&#39;s soul. The torso print is well done and highly detailed. There is no back print, which is no problem due to the cape.</p>

<p>The Trolley Witch is well done, but rather generic. She also has two face prints, one screaming with terror, the other quite friendly. I like here sand-green-and-gold cart, with the chocolate frog depicted by a chocloate frog, and presumably &#39;Every Flavour Beans&#39;&nbsp; depicted by an ice-cream piece.</p>

<p>Remus Lupin is arguably the best figure in this set. He has two face prints, one fairly friendly, while the other seems to depict him when he has transformed into his &#39;alternate&#39; being. The torso print (on two sides) is excellent, and depicts him in his street clothes, without teacher&#39;s robes. It has an excellent somewhat shabby look.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Within the constraints of the set (price point, size, etc.) I think the designer has done a very good job overall. I have come across comments that the engine is too small, the wagon is too small (and there is only one), no rails has been included, etc; I think that these are somewhat unjustified. For instance, in order to take the comments about the train into account, one would have to come up with something like the <strong>Emerald Night (set 10194)</strong>, which immediately would add another 20 to 30 euros to the price of this&nbsp;set at a minimum.&nbsp;Perhaps the station platforms could have been swapped for another passenger car, but IMHO platform offers much more opportunity for play. Also, another passenger car would have required more minifigures to be included.</p>

<p>The platform is quite well designed, even though I would have liked it to have been 1 brick higher. The transition between the Muggle platforms and platform 9 3/4 is simple but well done, and the designer has done an OK job creating an alternate reality for the wizard world with the poster and the printed newspapers.</p>

<p>The steam engine overall is well done. The most obvious weakness is the overly simplified drive train mechanism (though I am not sure Lego still has the parts for a more complicated (and realistic) drive train). The engine is well finished, and looks realistic. The passenger cart is arguably the weakest element, lacking doors and with no closed off compartments.&nbsp;So overall, the train leaves quite a bit of room for modding. This might even include motorizing the train.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>The lack or rails clearly make this a play set. The beginning of the Prisoner of Azkaban can clearly played out, just as Hogwarts Great Hall (set 75954) links to the early part of Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#39;s Stone (the first book), and the Hogwarts Whomping Willow (set 75953) is set in the early part of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (the second book).</p>

<p>There are many accessories included to aid in play. I also like the inclusion of the platform, as it now allows the characters to transition from the Muggle to the Wizard world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The lack of rails makes it rather hard to use this as a display set outright. That said, if one has rails laying around one can easily turn this into a simple display. It also allows for the expansion into a much bigger display as well.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>As said in the beginning, this might be the best of the higher end sets of the 2018 Harry Potter wave. Six minifigures (including Harry, Hermione and Ron), the Hogwarts express, a Dementor, Lupin (with facial expressions for both his personae), there is little not to like. I also think the designer has struck the right balance between realism/authenticity and playability in this set. Well done! The price for this set also seems very reasonable - big specialist parts, 4 unique minifigures, 800 pieces, and all for a PPP of 10.0 c. It also feels big enough for a set of this price (compare it for instance to the latest waves of X-wing Starfighters and TIE-fighters). Overall, a good set, and definitely worth considering if one is saving&nbsp;for one of the higher priced Harry Potter sets.</p>

"szczudel1","2019-10-16T02:59:47.923Z","Parent and Lego Train fan's review","<p>My son bough himself this set. However until the very moment he opened the package it was likely I will be the one to get it for birthday&nbsp;:)</p>

<p>From my sons&#39;s point of view it is great,&nbsp;playable set. He loves the ghost and playing with the magical door on the station. It is also nice you can lock front wheels of the engine to play on flat surface. Since yesterday, I heard at least two dozens of time &quot;Harry Potter&quot;, even though we have not yet read the books. So, as for toy it is greats.</p>

<p>Now will be time to complain a little from a Lego Train enthusiast:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Lack of train magnets is strange. This is obviously a train set. Emerald Night also did not have track, so it is pointless to mark it as a playset. I had to use my own magnets, which is annoying, because I had to take them out of other train/cart. On the bright side it is fairy easy to replace present &quot;system&quot; with magnets. All in all, this is, in my opinion, a flaw of this set.</li>
	<li>Engine and coal carts are too short. It gives the feeling of a miniature toy, not a 1:x model. Not something one expects from a Lego Steam Engine.</li>
	<li>Instruction does not point how to motorize this. Of course most obvious way would be to rebuild coal cart, however size of it would have to be at least 50% bigger, which would destroy the proportion of engine-cart. As for motorizing: how the set is build it is impossible to motorize it as Emerald Night can be motorized (With Power Functions).</li>
	<li>The Cart-Lady should have been replaced with a machinist.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Even though this is a lot of complaining, the set is great. Every Lego train fan waits for steam train models and welcomes it to collection. However this one tastes slightly not spiced enough.&nbsp;</p>

"dr_legolass","2019-11-17T06:08:19.41Z","Cool parts and look, but not sturdy ","<p>The selection of minifigs&nbsp;is cool with some neat special pieces. The Hogwarts Express looks great moving, with the moving drive shaft. Plus, it works on the standard train tracks, which is a fun plus!&nbsp;So, it&#39;s a nice set for a Harry Potter and/or train fan.&nbsp;The downside is that it seems like it&#39;s designed to sit on a shelf rather than actually be played with. The station falls apart very easily if you try to move it. It&#39;s rather un-Lego like to have the final product be so unsturdy. The train cars aren&#39;t easy to detach, and you&#39;re more likely to break a car than to separate the pieces that attach them.&nbsp;</p>

"asbailao","2019-09-12T02:09:16.363Z","Love it!","<p>Love it! It&#39;s brilliant, one of the best scenes in the movies and books - the thrill of catching the magic train, when they meet lupin, the dementor. The clothes look perfect. The stairs look like the ones in the movies, when harry is walking with hagrid in hp1, and with&nbsp;sirius in hp4.</p>

<p>I would have changed (and I have changed actually in&nbsp;my set ??) the color of some bricks at the platform - king&#39;s cross is very dark sand - and Lego has that color, but they opted for the dark orange-brownish&nbsp;just like the castle... it should have come with train tracks, though... but I love the trolley witch, the chocolate frog, the news stand with daily prophet newspapers! And it was brilliant to build, more challenging than I was expecting.&nbsp;</p>

"Nic1306","2020-01-01T10:46:37.467Z","The Lego Harry Potter Hogwarts Express","<p>General infos about the set:</p>

<p>The Lego Hogwarts Express has 801 Pieces and costs 79.99$. The set bases of the third movie &quot;<strong>The prisonier of Askaban</strong>&quot; and got released in 2018 with 6 minifigures.</p>

<p>The minifigures:</p>

<p>First up we have Harry Potter(HP153)and Ron Weasley(HP154).Both of the minifigures were already released in the set 75950 &quot;Aragogs Lair&quot; and in multiple books, so those two minifigures aren&#39;t exclusive to that set. The Hermoine Granger(HP156) minifigure is exclusive as well as the Lupin and the Trolley Witch minifigures(HP157 and HP158). We also get a Dementor.</p>

<p>The railway station:</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the bad part of the set. The build of the railway station feels incomplete and the build isn&#39;t very solid and a very easy build, but it has a good playability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hogwarts Express:</p>

<p>There can&#39;t be said much about the train.It&#39;s a very solid train. Altought the train was easy to build, I was impressed how good it looked. A very cool and solid train, but sadly there&#39;s no train track with it, what would make it better.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>It&#39;s a set with a good minifigure selection and some exclusive ones to.Sadly no track&nbsp; an okay price and a good train. Only bad thing is the railway station.</p>

"HandPositions","2020-05-08T00:07:32.903Z","The Hogwarts Express is Running Late!","<p>LEGO set 75955, Hogwarts Express, is a fun set featuring the Hogwarts Express, Platform 9 3/4, five minifgures, and two character figures, plus a luggage cart and sweets trolley. The only thing missing from this set is tracks, which have been included in all four earlier renditions of this beautiful, streamlined set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The selection of minifigures is great for this set. Harry, Ron, and Hermione, the &ldquo;big three&rdquo;, are the stars of the set. These three minifigs are provided with Muggle clothing and child-size leg elements, along with hair pieces that are perfect for them. Each has a different wand. The set is roughly based on The Prisoner of Azkaban, the third book and film, and so it also includes a Remus Lupin minifigure, with fitting scratches and a reverse face showing th beginning of the werewolf transformation. He also has a wand and&nbsp;a suitcase as accessories. The Trolley Witch minifigure does not have any accessories, but does push a green sweets trolley with recognizable wizard candies. The Dementor figure has a great face piece, showing an accurate appearance. It also has the relatively new ghost leg element instead of the joint piece seen in previous versions of the figure. It has a black standard-issue hood piece, as seen earlier. The Scabbers the rat figure is a newer piece than the more regularly seen rubber-type mouse element. The only thing different between the figures of this set and those in the Prisoner of Azkaban wave is the minifigure leg length. In later sets, they include the medium legs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The station is a simple, yet beautiful addition to the set. It has a wanted Sirius Black poster, The Boy Who Lived Newspapers, and the iconic 9 3/4 wall. This is the second time this function has been in a set. It has a bridge that connects to a smaller platform with stairs running down both sides. The bridge is the perfect height to slide the train underneath.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The train itself is beautiful. With a locomotive, tender, and passenger carriage, this is one of the largest Hogwarts Express trains to date. The engine has a smooth, streamlined effect with a small interior, although there is no engineer, as the train is enchanted. There is a section of the trucks&nbsp;that can be turned if a small hinge is lifted. This can be used if you have tracks from a previous train set. The tender is small, but has an opening feature, as seen in earlier versions, to hide accessories for storage or play. The passenger car has an opening side and fits four minifigures. It may be slightly too small to fit the Trolley while minifigures are inside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this set is wonderful. The only things I would recommend are tracks and medium legs for the younger minifigures. Otherwise, it is a beautiful edition of the Hogwarts Express.</p>
