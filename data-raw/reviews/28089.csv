"vikings","2019-12-30T00:21:52.217Z","Great Figure","<p>This is&nbsp;my third one from this series and&nbsp;it is another good one.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a polybag and has the small instructions you get with them. Instructions are clear and easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>There are some unique parts in this. You get the silver pistol which isn&#39;t a common shade for them to come in. You also get the CMS minifigure stand, and then the back of the stand is also a really nice piece as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Only one figure in the Kessel&nbsp;Mine Worker. It is a really cool and unique figure to get. This is the&nbsp;figures first appearance in Lego. He is armed with a silver pistol. The head is really well done. The detail is really nice on the mask. The red over the eyes is&nbsp;a nice touch. There is printing on the back of the head as well. The body has printing on both sides as well. You have a belt that is half on the body and half on the legs. On the body&nbsp;there are some&nbsp;markings that seem to indicate some sort of rank among the mine workers. Then there are some stains of somesort on both the body and all over the legs. Overall this is a great figure to get.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>Really easy to build. Took me a couple minutes to build. There is 1 sticker.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:</strong></p>

<p>After finishing it is really good for display. The stand is exactly the same as the others. The back is different. The image on it looks to be a control room were the mine workers, work at. You are able to connect them to each other for display.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a another great figure in this series. The detail of the printing is great. They did a really good job on it. This is my favorite of the three I own so far (I also own DJ and the R3-M2). Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>
