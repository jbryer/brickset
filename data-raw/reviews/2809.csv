<p>The problem in the previous description was that the minifigure could not be placed in the vehicle. Here is a version you can. Obviously it&#39;s a tiller truck. I just don&rsquo;t understand why this isn&rsquo;t the main construction.&nbsp;So here I have to apologize to the designer for criticizing his work. It was quite hard work to come up with so many versions of the parts in the set.</p>
