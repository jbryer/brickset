<br />
Solo: A Star Wars Story was a controversial film, one that I personally liked after watching it yesterday and reading the Expanded Edition Solo&nbsp;novel written by Mur Lafferty. When the film was released I was not into Star Wars very much, so I not only missed out on the film itself but also the sets based on the film.<br />
<br />
Prior to this polybag&nbsp;being gifted to me by a friend, I had no idea this set even existed, and certainly had no plans to purchase this set.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I think this set was my first ever LEGO Star Wars set, an introduction to the universe of LEGO Star Wars.<br />
<br />
<strong>Packaging</strong><br />
<br />
This set has&nbsp;normal polybag packaging, with a thin transparent strip on the back of the bag for you to peek at some of the parts. The art is the Solo box art, with the bright golden-yellow cloud-like design over the white rims of the packaging, which is a very attractive design in my opinion. Alden Ehrenreich&#39;s Han Solo as well as Chewbacca&nbsp;both appear&nbsp;as the box mascots.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contents and Build</strong><br />
<br />
Inside the bag are the 22 included pieces, and a small set of fold-out instructions - the kind which you get in polybags and other extremely small sets.<br />
<br />
It took me roughly a minute to put everything together.<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigure</strong><br />
<br />
The titular <strong>Han Solo Mudtrooper</strong> is the only minifigure included. There is great muddy printing on both face prints as well as all throughout the figure, and I really like it. Dark tan might not be the most accurate colour compared to the film, but I think it looks good on this figure. Han&#39;s hairpiece is coloured the same dark tan as the rest of the figure, and I believe this piece in this colour is exclusive to this polybag.<br />
<br />
I really like this Han figure because even if the character only briefly appears like this, people can still recreate Han and Chewie&#39;s first meeting in MOCs.<br />
<br />
<strong>Builds</strong><br />
<br />
Accompanying the lovely Han figure is a brick-built minifigure stand, which uses a simple but effective design that was used to create the base, and I would assume the builds of these bases would be exactly the same throughout this line of display minifigures.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The background is especially cool in my opinion, using a piece of a material unknown to me, with some beautiful printing in a tan colour scheme depicting what appears to be a crashed AT-DT on a Mimban battlefield. There is&nbsp;also a LEGO logo and a flame yellow Star Wars logo. The left and right&nbsp;sides of the base have a brick with Technic pin hole and a Technic pin respectively, a quality common throughout these sets, which allow them to be connected.&nbsp; Han stands on a black 3x4 minifigure display plate.<br />
<br />
The base displays&nbsp;a nice plaque, represented by a black 1x4 tile with a sticker with the words &quot;Han Solo Mud Trooper&quot;. It is unfortunate that LEGO chose to include stickers, even in a polybag like this one. If they were to have printed&nbsp;the words on the plaque, it would have pleased a lot more fans and these polybags would have had even more value.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong><br />
<br />
This polybag was intended to be displayed along with the other similar polybags, but on its own it still makes a nice desk charm. As such, this set does not offer too much playability.<br />
<br />
This is further worsened by the fact that this set does not come with weapons of any sort.<br />
While it can be argued that Han never used any weapons during his appearance like this, the other polybag - Kessel Mine Worker - depicted a figure which was not shown using any weapons yet that set came with a pearl silver blaster pistol for the worker. It is also unfortunate that Han did not receive such treatment - a blaster rifle or pistol would&#39;ve provided that much more playability.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall thoughts</strong><br />
<br />
I am satisfied with how this set turned out, but it still leaves something to be desired.<br />
<br />
If you are a fan of the Solo movie, specifically Han and Chewie&#39;s first encounter,&nbsp;then you would like this little polybag - it&#39;s a reasonably&nbsp;priced little set. If not, don&#39;t bother picking it up unless you&#39;re a die-hard collector or only want to resell it when it goes up in value - after all, the minifigure is exclusive, even if it&#39;s only targeted towards a very specific audience.<br />
<br />
If LEGO does this sort of thing again, I would love for them to make a Dryden Vos figure as he is one of the more notable missing characters from the LEGO Solo sets.<br />
<br />
Thank you&nbsp;for reading, I hope you found this review helpful and informative.</p>
