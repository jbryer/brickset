<p>For some reason, this set was not on my &quot;to buy&quot; list. I am not sure what it was exactly... maybe I&nbsp;was still a little&nbsp;irritated that I never picked up the Shuttle Tyderium and the Landing Craft is just not my favorite shuttle. I dunno.</p>

<p>But I saw it on sale and I am really glad that&nbsp;I picked it up. It was an enjoyable build&nbsp;and&nbsp;I really&nbsp;liked how the large, white, main body pieces all came together. There were some&nbsp;clever surprises along the way. And the finished product is much larger than I expected.</p>

<p>Minifigures - Sandtroopers are great. Pilot is great too. Did I need another R2 and Obi Wan... nope. But they are fine. We could always use more troopers but having all Stormtroopers would have been boring and probably decrease play value.</p>

<p>Speaking of value... I just cannot imagine spending $90 on this one. But, it has been out for a year now and if you can pick one up on sale, you definitely should before it gets retired. It would look great on display next to any of the Tatooine sets&nbsp;like the Escape Pod&nbsp;or even the&nbsp;Dewback microfigure.</p>

"TBillz","2020-06-03T20:00:21.843Z","Great Addition to the Imperial Fleet","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Introduction </strong>&ndash; Unfortunately I just missed the last Imperial Shuttle Tydirium set 75094 so when I saw a fresh opportunity to get an Imperial Shuttle I had to have it! I know it&rsquo;s not on screen in some versions of a New Hope and when it is present, it&rsquo;s just for a second but I really wanted to build an Imperial Shuttle. Here&rsquo;s my review!</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Minifigures </strong>&ndash; 10/10 First off the R2-D2 will make a fine addition to your R2-D2 army with great printing. It&rsquo;s as good as it gets there. Obi-Wan isn&rsquo;t exclusive here but it&rsquo;s still a good figure yet the hairpiece feels outdated. It&rsquo;s good and works for the figure but some of the more updated, current detailed hairpieces would have been awesome. The Imperial pilot is amazing. I love the dark flight suit with the hat and Imperial design on it. The sand troopers are my favorite here. You get 2, one with a black pauldron and one with an orange which both are rare in sets. I love the detail of sand giving these figures a grit look. Seriously these minifigures make the selection top notch. I mean they even have brick built life support backpacks on them.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>The Build</strong> &ndash; &nbsp;9/10 The build goes together fairly well although there are some gaping issues around some of the cargo doors and the &ldquo;neck&rdquo; of the ship. The designers do a good job of trying to add details that look mechanical in those gaps easing the imperfections. Honestly it&rsquo;s just a part of Lego when you are building curved surfaces with bricks and brick like pieces. I still feel the ship is solid with a good technic core. The finishing pieces look outstanding but it displays better at certain angles. Honestly I left off the stickers as sometimes white bricks clash with white stickers, but I don&rsquo;t think the stickers are a must at all. If anything leaving them off makes the design feel sleeker. The model has a great amount of cargo or troop space inside. If you position it well you could get up to 12 storm troopers in the cargo bay. The loading ramp is also a really cool play feature that would pose well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Parts</strong> &ndash; 9/10 The white bricks look very clean on this ship, it makes you want to swoosh this thing! The large cargo area parts are a rare selection and the technic pieces are mostly hidden but create a very firm model. The designers really did a good job using newer pieces to add a level of detail to the ship. For instance the shield pieces that make the landing gear just give this a more detailed feel. After the build the only downside would be I did add a few finishing pieces, especially around the &ldquo;neck&rdquo; which helped to hide and enclose more of the ship.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Value</strong> &ndash; 8/10 The retail price of $90 hits pretty hard on this set. I did purchase it right as it got on the shelves so possibly my excitement blinded me a bit. When you get the set put together, to me it doesn&rsquo;t feel $90. If you could find this set for $70 or less it would be a great addition to your Star Wars collection. I was excited to buy it but after I built it, I definitely felt like waiting for a discount would have been a more strategic method. Sure there are some bigger pieces and a good number of minifigures but to me, it was just a little higher than I would have liked.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Overall </strong>&ndash; 10/10 I really love this set; to this day it is one of my favorites. The white armor stands out in my collection of Imperial vessels and the fact that it&rsquo;s full of space for troops is perfect. Seriously you could cram 12 stormtroopers in it and a 13<sup>th</sup> if you include the pilot. I love the iconic Star Wars ships but also, having a variant to the iconic ships gives the Lego Star Wars line more depth. Plus I love when they come out with new stuff never before used. The Imperial minifigures are hands down a prize to behold, and recently it seems like sets that have 5 minifigures are become less prevalant. I had a lot of fun building this set after missing the Tydirium Shuttle in 2015. Based on pictures I think this ship is different enough that even if you have the Tydirium this would be an excellent addition to any Lego Star Wars collection adding depth the your Imperial Fleet!</p>

It comes with a lot of space for Stormtroopers and one does not get bored by playing. Overall, I enjoyed its construction. Even if one has the Tydirium or the latest Imperial Shuttle, this is a great addition to any&nbsp;collection:&nbsp;such an item&nbsp;is of great value to collectors&nbsp;as it is not expected to be re-released. Because of its rarity, if one finds this between EUR120-E160 (max), then it is worth the investment. Over EUR200, it&#39;s only for fanatic Lego Star Wars collectors.</p>
