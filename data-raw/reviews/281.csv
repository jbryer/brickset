"krysto2002","2008-07-24T07:10:01.543Z","McDonalds finally makes something worthwhile","So McDonalds has created a decent Happy Meal (just around the time I ate them!) and with it, a free LEGO set. Though this does not have the bricks that the previous LEGO/McDonalds kits had, it does however have Bionicle masks. The torso is really cool and can serve many creative purposes. The head is really blocky, but has been used often since its creation. The throwing arm, though bsed on throwbots technology, is not as good as the powerful throwbot arms, or the Vahki pincers to come.

This is one of the lesser Matoran, since the mask and disk differ, and the color scheme is kind of &quot;enh&quot;, so it isn't really all that great (but you didn't expect McDonalds to actually include a transparent part did you? It would be much cheaper to mass produce if the mask and body were the same color).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-10-29T17:31:35.357Z","adorable!","All of these Matoran are adorable. Maku (later on Macku but not in this set) is a great set. But, as with all of these guy, they aren't very posable. But they're from McDonalds Happy Meals. Maku has the disk flingy army thingy and another arm that has a ""claw"". She's very short, but once again it's from a Happy Meal. This is also the only set were you can get a Blue Huna so that's a bonus. 
Overall, a good set. You dont have o get her, but it's a good addition to the collection, or for parts. It's also a nice piece for the shelf display, or a paperweight. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Maku is very cool mainly because of his bendable arms and cool mask. His mask comes in blue red and silver/black but I like this the best. His main body is cool and he is basicly an assortmant of super rare peices and is a must have for any peice conscious bionicle fan!

pros: 
        cool arms
        awsome mask
        wicked body
        tricked out feet

cons: 
         Realy? Is this necessary? I don't just think so! I know so!

A good set for any peice conscious bionicle fan!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"The_Dumb_One","2011-03-06T20:40:20.76Z","Don't point your arm at me!","<p>The main good things about this set are the rare mask and the disk arm. The build is virtually inexistant and there are, like, 5 or 6 parts, so you can't do much with that.</p>
<p>I have also purchased onepu and comparing the two, I feel like I'm comparing a hambuger and a Big Mac. They have a few differences, but they're essencially the same.</p>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,5
"Cligra","2011-08-26T20:52:16.37Z","Very nice, for what it is.","This little promo McToran set includes Maku, a Ga-Koro villager. The design is nice, and the parts are practically exclusive, at least in the colours seen here. The ""gimmick"" of this villager (and all of the McToran) is that you can pull back their arms and throw a small disc. The disc launches surprisingly far, and looks quite nice. While I wouldn't spend much monet on this set (I got it as a gift), I would definitely recommend it if you find it for under three or four dollars, or if you are a huge BIONICLE fan.<br>",TRUE,4,4,1,3,4
"123MrBrick","2015-07-15T00:15:41.373Z","The Odd McToran Out.","<p>I recently got 5 of the McToran (the six McDonalds Bionicle figures) from ebay and I am very happy with them. I really like Maku because she is different from the rest of the group.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I got these figures loose so I can&#39;t really say anything here. Look at Brickset&#39;s picture if you want to see the polybag.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Maku shares all of her parts, with the exception of the mask, with her fellow McToran. Maku has the parts in unique colors, though. After those similarities, things start to get weird. Unlike the rest of the McToran, who have colors different from their respective Toa, Maku has the standard shades of blue. While her Bamboo Disk features the Kanohi Kaukau, she wears a powerless Kanohi Huna.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set takes maybe 30 seconds. There are only 8 parts in the set, and it is extremely simple to peg it all together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really like the finished product. While it is not the most realistic design, the figure still looks cool. She has several features: her right arm will throw the included Bamboo Disk when pulled back; her other arm will &quot;punch&quot; when pulled back, and she can store her Bamboo Disk on her back. I am kind of worried that the arms will break, but so far nothing has happened. I&nbsp; have not been able to knock her mask off with a punch or Disk throw, which is kind of disappointing.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set will really only appeal to Bionicle fans. Unless you really want to get the whole set of them, I think getting one McToran will bring you the same amount of fun as getting all of them. I mainly got these for the Kanohi masks.</p>

"Matroxide","2012-06-16T12:21:25.823Z","Turaga Nokama's Right Hand ","I can remember like it was just a few days ago, it was 2001 and my family were going to McDonalds for dinner. I had Chicken Nuggets and I was excited to see a little blue figure in a bag. Macku was my first Bionicle set&nbsp;ever and&nbsp;I played with her for hours!&nbsp;I flung&nbsp;the that disk she came with for the rest of the day fighting with my brother's Hewkii. now my Bionicle collection had grown just about to every bionicle set ever with only a few missing. as&nbsp;I say for all my 2001&nbsp;matoran reviews, you can combine Macku with Kongu and Matoro to make a Matoran version of Wairuha, or with all of them to make the Matoran Nui in the comic every Matoran came with! Macku came with her bright blue Kanohi&nbsp;Huna,&nbsp;the Mask of Concealment, a bamboo disk, made of plastic, and a realy cute appearence!",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"Gameaucracy","2015-03-25T05:57:09.63Z","Maku, damn near killed 'em, huehuehuehue","<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Oh yeah baby, the McDonalds sets. These were amazing when I was a kid. A LEGO set AND heart-attack inducing chunks of question-mark chicken? Where do I sign? Oh right I was a kid I didn&#39;t have to sign anything! Just had to pester my parents enough to take me there. Oh memories of that&nbsp;ball-pit, I can still smell the discarded diapers (psychiatrist&nbsp;says I&#39;m making great progress).</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The set is just a bare-bones&nbsp;Bionicle&nbsp;set, like 3 parts with a disk that you can shoot at your brother when he tries to steal one of your fries. Yeah yeah LEGO instructions, I see your &quot;don&#39;t hit anyone in the face&quot; warning. This was back in the wild west days of lawsuits, don&#39;t need no rules to ruin my good time.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">So instead of describing these sets, I&#39;m just going to copy paste the&nbsp;last&nbsp;paragraphs and instead describe the amazing sodium and trans-fats meal I had.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">For this set I had a hamburger Happy Meal. At least I think it was a hamburger, with how thin the patty was they could have just colored a piece of writing paper with those brown smelly markers they used to have in school (ah, cleverly disguised things to get high on) and I wouldn&#39;t have known the distance. And I&#39;m pretty sure the onion was just chunks of plastic that broke off the cup lids. Overall pretty good meal.</p>
