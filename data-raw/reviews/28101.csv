"Windsorlego","2019-10-20T12:17:47.677Z","The Little Airport","<p>I managed to obtain this set from Ebay for a reasonable sum of money.&nbsp; &nbsp;I see from the instructions booklet that only 10,000 of these were produced so I feel quite pleased that I obtained this.</p>

<p>The booklet is the usual sturdy booklet that you get with the Architecture range and all in black.</p>

<p>There are quite a lot of 1x1 and 1x2 pieces in this set so you will need a pair of nimble fingers!&nbsp; You start off with doing the base before moving on to the airport building itself. You need to make sure that you haven&#39;t missed doing anything before moving on to the next step.</p>

<p>As the majority of the pieces are small it could be easy to miss something during the build so careful scrutiny of each section before moving on is recommended.</p>

<p>Playability doesn&#39;t come into this as the set is too small in that respect.</p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed making this set and would recommend getting one if you can.&nbsp; Having never visited Billund Airport I can&#39;t say how accurate the set is to it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I purchased this set at Billund Airport for 799,95 DKK (approx. &euro;111) on 30 December 2022.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A hard to find set, you can only buy this set when departing from Billund Airport. For me, that was my trip back home, after visiting the LEGO House and Legoland.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Building this set is easy and enjoyable. The microscale techniques are&nbsp;applied very well and the addition of five airplanes are very nice. I believe they represent different airliners that use this airport; KLM, Lufthansa, Ryanair, Air France, and another one I can&#39;t identify.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Considering how much this set costs, there really isn&#39;t that much in the box.&nbsp;Personally I would&#39;ve liked to see this set to be bigger and include the runway. Still, it looks very nice on my bookshelf, and makes for a good reminder of my lego trip.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">If you happen to visit Billund, and when departing they still happen to have this set, just get it.</p>
