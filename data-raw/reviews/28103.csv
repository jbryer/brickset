<p>The construction&nbsp;of both was as much fun as one could get with a Brickhead. It took me about 30 minutes to build the pair of them. Especially Slimer&#39;s construction deviates from the standard pattern for Brickheadz.</p>

<p>Venkman is the first to be built, and the prints alone are worth it the price for this set - even though they will be difficult to use for other types of build. His hair is good, and OK to build. The construction of the proton-pack is OK. Yeah, it is cartoony Brickheadz style, but somehow it is seems off. Venkman&#39;s front more than makes up for it, though.</p>

<p>Slimer&nbsp;is brilliant, and might also be very attractive for people looking for certain specialty parts. The technique to make him &#39;float&#39; is simple but effective, though some &#39;upside down&#39; building is included. Many parts are either lime-green, or some parts in the core of the build&nbsp;seem to be&nbsp;ight blueish green. His mouth print is good, and I like how he is &#39;armed&#39;&nbsp;with some hot dogs.</p>

<p>Overall, I like this set, and think it one of the better ones within the Brickheadz&nbsp;genre. If you are a Brickheadz&nbsp;or Ghostbusters fan, this set is definitely worth picking up.</p>
