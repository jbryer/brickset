Just&nbsp;4-5 small sticker missing from the series.</div><div>I really like the Model Team series, this is the fourth for me. There is no shortage of special parts such as chrome grille and chimney pieces, rare and unique doors, windows and extra large size (only addition was found in 5571) truck wheels.</div><div>The overall picture is very nice, very good in the little red and white in the gray color. The truck is quite large, two-Technic fig can fit comfortably in the cabin.</div><div>The building was not hard, The steps are quite simple. The pictures are very cozy, the alternative model that looks good. (This is a large jeep).</div><div>Only one problem (which is why I was less from playability) to the chassis weight after a while I think a large burden on the wheels. (I build a little grass-roots support on the frame to withstand the wheels.)</div><div>To sum up about 4.5 points for me, this kit on the shelf ornament! Model Team recommend to all fans!</div><div><br></div><div>(Sorry for my bad english language use!)</div>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
