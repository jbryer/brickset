<p>This &quot;set&quot; comes with a variety of different foods and a storage crate. The food selection is all over the place, and that is a good thing. We get apples alongside of pizza, bananas alongside of a turkey, icecream alongside of croissants. I love it. The only downside is that there are no drinks, unless you count in the 2 red cups. I could have gone without the red cups and with, for example a winebottle. It would have made this an even bigger treat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>These polybags will especially come in handy for MOC builders and will fit into any scene from any era.</p>

<p>If you are down on LEGO-food, and you need a fine selection for a very decent price, this is the set to get! No Doubt.</p>
