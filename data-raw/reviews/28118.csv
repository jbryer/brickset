<p>21 pieces are included with 1 spare 1x1 transparent yellow tile.</p>

<h3>Usefulness</h3>

<p>The &#39;builds&#39; / pieces&nbsp;are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>2 Red Bicycles</li>
	<li>1 Skateboard</li>
	<li>2 Small Yellow Fences&nbsp;</li>
	<li>1 Pizza Box</li>
	<li>1 Yellow Basket</li>
	<li>1 Letter / Envelope</li>
	<li>1 Backpack</li>
	<li>1 Umbrella (closed)</li>
	<li>2 Grey Helmets</li>
	<li>1 Blue Baseball Cap</li>
</ul>

<p>This set is all about getting moving around the City. The two bikes are the main stars of the set, which can be embellished with the included basket and pizza box. Two helmets are included for your minifigs, safety first!</p>

<p>Minifigs&nbsp;need somewhere to put their bikes whilst they are in buildings, so two small fences to lean the bikes up against are ideal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The skateboard is green with the usual two studs for a minfig, there isn&#39;t much more to say. The minifig could be wearing one of the helmets or the baseball cap.</p>

<p>An umbrella (surprisingly rare, maybe it is always sunny in the Lego world) is included, but perhaps a single minifig carrying an umbrella will look odd! The backpack can turn a minfig&nbsp;into a tourist exploring the area.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This could be a useful and reasonably priced set for anyone wanting their minfigs to have a cleaner way to get around their City, complete with some fences to store their bikes against. The umbrella and backpack are nice touches.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The &#39;xtra&#39; polybags are are a welcome new line, and I hope that many further sets are produced. It would be nice to have these more easily available, in non-Lego stores for example.</p>
