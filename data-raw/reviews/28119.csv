<p>34 pieces are included&nbsp;with 1 spare 1x1 clear round plate</p>

<h3>Usefulness</h3>

<p>The &#39;builds&#39; are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>2 Streetlamps (1 with 2 &#39;street name&#39; signs)</li>
	<li>2 Low-level Lamps</li>
	<li>1 Postbox</li>
	<li>1 Newspaper board/stand</li>
	<li>1 Bench</li>
	<li>1 Hand-held lamp</li>
	<li>1 Camera</li>
	<li>1 Mobile Phone / Cell Phone</li>
</ul>

<p>The streetlamps are useful for those who need more lighting around their city. The lamp with 2 &#39;street name&#39; signs are a nice idea. The low-level lamp builds work well at the entrance/path to buildings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The postbox is fairly basic and perhaps needs raising up slightly.</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t clear to me exactly what the newspaper board/stand is, perhaps it is simply a place where you can pick up a newspaper, or perhaps is meant to be a board where a headline from a paper is displayed, as is common in the UK.</p>

<p>The 1x2 printed tile Mobile/Cell phone is useful, as many citizens walk around with them glued to their hand these days, so having more of these pieces is useful for putting together a typical street scene.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure where the hand-held lamp could be used in a modern city, it is perhaps something suited to a Victorian&nbsp;city!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This could be a useful and reasonably priced set for anyone needing more &#39;lighting&#39; around their city. Many of these pieces may already be &#39;spares&#39; found in many AFOLs collections however.</p>

<p>The &#39;xtra&#39; polybags are are a welcome new line, and I hope that many further sets are produced. It would be nice to have these more easily available, in non-Lego stores for example.</p>

"USAgent","2019-01-11T00:19:55.793Z","Disappointing","<p>I like the idea of the mailbox, newspaper box, and more streetlights (including the street signs).&nbsp; Bench is OK, the lantern and camera don&#39;t seem to go with it but whatever.&nbsp; I think a pack of just lamps and mailbox and maybe the bench would be good enough.&nbsp; I rated low on &quot;building experience&quot; because let&#39;s be honest...there&#39;s not much to build here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What I find most annoying about this set is that the lamps are black.&nbsp; I gues on the one side it&#39;s another option in addition to the white, but all the others I have already are white.&nbsp; All of the lamps included in the modular buildings are white.&nbsp; So now going with this set is a departure from the established standard.&nbsp; Maybe having two version of this, one white and one black would have been a better option.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>But overall, I love the idea of these &quot;xtras&quot;.</p>
