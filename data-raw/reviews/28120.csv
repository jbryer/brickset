<p>24 pieces are included with 1 spare flower stem and one of each colour&nbsp;of flower head.</p>

<h3>Usefulness</h3>

<p>The &#39;builds&#39; / pieces are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 Large Tree</li>
	<li>1 Small Tree</li>
	<li>1 Bush</li>
	<li>2 Plant Stems with Leaves</li>
	<li>2 White Picket Fences</li>
	<li>3 Flowers (3 Stems with Bottom Pin, 3 Plant Plates with Leaves, 3 sets of Red/Light Orange/White Flower Heads)</li>
	<li>2 Yellow Frogs</li>
</ul>

<p>This set is all about bringing some greenery a city, to brighten up the lives of busy minifigs. The trees, bush, flowers (of the newer type), and other greenery can be dotted around a city or put in a small cluster to provide a place for minifigs to unwind on their lunch break!</p>

<p>There are a few odd pieces however. The two yellow flogs are frankly an bizarre choice for a city, and would probably be a rather alarming find!</p>

<p>Similarly, the&nbsp;two picket fences might be better suited to a suburban or rural area, they aren&#39;t usually seen in a city.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A bit of nature can brighten a place up, but some of these pieces might not look quite right in a city.</p>

<p>The &#39;xtra&#39; polybags are are a welcome new line, and I hope that many further sets are produced. It would be nice to have these more easily available, in non-Lego stores for example.</p>

"lkb57","2018-06-27T04:09:29.163Z","Xtra plants are always welcome!","<p>When I first saw that TLG was making these new &quot;xtra&quot; sets, I was incredibly excited. They reminded me of the old accessory packs like <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6316-1/Flags-and-Fences"">6316</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6317-1/Trees-and-Flowers"">6317</a>, or <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6318-1/Flowers-Trees-and-Fences"">6318</a>, which I&#39;d always wanted as a kid to flesh out the towns and castles I was building, but which I&#39;d never got. Anyways, I&nbsp;had the chance to pick up two&nbsp;of the Botanical Accesories&nbsp;packs, and they were well worth the $3.99 I paid for each.</p>

<p>The packaging is simple (the set is a polybag), but I really like how all of the pieces are easily visible on the front of the package. You know up front what you are getting. There are no instructions, which is fine since most of the pieces require no assembly, and those that do (the stems and flowers in the case of this set) are easy enough to figure out just by looking at the packaging.</p>

<p>The parts selection is very good, but (in my opinion) not fantastic. I could see a diehard castle or city MOC-er&nbsp;wanting to buy quite a few of these for the plants, but in doing so you&#39;d also end up with a LOT of yellow frogs. This is fine, I guess, but I would have rather had another plant piece like <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4114348/bamboo-leaves-3x3"">this</a> or <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6050929/grass-w-tube-%C3%B8-3-2"">this</a> in place of the frogs and white fences. However, I&#39;ll forgive TLG the frogs and fences since they included a (relatively) new piece, the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6182261/plant-w-plate-1x1-no-1"">round 1x1 plate with leaves</a>. I&#39;ve wanted a lot of this particular piece ever since I first saw it, so the fact that each pack comes with three is a huge bonus.</p>

<p>In short, this set provides you with an excellent assortment of plant pieces (and some frogs and fences) for a very good price. If you are interested in building any kind of MOC that will feature vegetation, this is a must-have purchase.</p>

<p>Overall I give it a 4 out of 5.</p>

"Minifig290","2019-03-24T11:51:41.53Z","Xtra Useful","<p>Hello all, today I&#39;ll be looking at one of the many sets from the ever growing theme Xtra. The Botanical Accessories set i probably the most useful of the 6 polybags released under theme. Having 24 parts and retailing for &pound;2.99/$3.99 gives a price per part of 12.5p/16.6c.</p>

<p>This set can only be purchased from LEGO stores/online or at LEGOLAND stores. Lets look at the polybags contents.</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>There are not really any builds in this set (plus no instructions) so I&#39;ll just take a look at the 24 parts.</p>

<p>In this set there are:</p>

<p>1x Large tree in green</p>

<p>1x Small tree in green</p>

<p>1x bush in green</p>

<p>2x Large leafs (on a removable sprue)</p>

<p>3x Grass (Flower stem) in green, this is the newer design of the flower stem part (Plus a spare)</p>

<p>3x Small leaf in light green</p>

<p>9x 1x1 flower studs with five petals (plus a a spare for each colour):</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3x in white</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3x in red</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3x in light orange</p>

<p>Also in the set there are a few non botanical items such as 2 yellow frogs an 2 white picketed fences</p>

<p><strong>Suggested builds</strong></p>

<p>On the front of the polybag all three of the flower stems are in a small leaf piece with 3 of the coloured flower 1x1 parts, but apart form there are no other suggested builds.</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I absolutely love this polybag as it is extremely useful for builders, it is so convenient to have these sets available as they give us easy ways to get much useful parts such as the trees and the bush parts. I also appreciate the frogs and fence being included for a little more than plants.</p>

<p>I recommend this set to anyone building a city or maybe a zoo or parts etc as it will save money and time buying parts off Bricklink or LEGO&#39;s Bricks &amp; Pieces service, out of curiosity i added all the parts of this set onto B&amp;P and it came to &pound;5.81 the large tree buy itself cost &pound;2.06. This set is definitely worth the price of &pound;3/$4.</p>

<p><strong>Pros- </strong>Cheap and efficient way to get LEGO botanical parts, Perfect value, Extremely useful for moc builders</p>

<p><strong>Cons- </strong>Wish it was easier to obtain so be available at shops other than LEGO brand stores</p>
