<p>46 pieces are included (at the time of writing, Brickset was reporting a lower number), with 5 spares (a bone and each of the 1x1 round studs)</p>

<h3>Usefulness</h3>

<p>The &#39;builds&#39; are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>4 Traffic Lights (two with additional pedestrian crossing light/button)</li>
	<li>1 Dustbin / Trashcan</li>
	<li>1 Wheelbarrow</li>
	<li>1 Broom</li>
	<li>1 Glass bottle</li>
	<li>1 Bone</li>
	<li>1 Banana</li>
	<li>2 Three-leaf studs</li>
</ul>

<p>The 4 traffic lights are clearly the main build, and will be a useful addition for any city that don&#39;t currently have any. They are simple but effective.</p>

<p>The bone, banana, and&nbsp;bottle can go in the dustbin to make it more realistic, and the broom could be used by a nearby road cleaner.</p>

<p>The wheelbarrow doesn&#39;t have any obvious place in a city, in my opinion, although perhaps could be used by a road construction crew.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This could be a useful and reasonably priced set for anyone needing traffic lights for their city. Many of these pieces may already be &#39;spares&#39; found in many AFOLs collections however.</p>

<p>The &#39;xtra&#39;&nbsp;polybags are are a welcome new line, and I hope that many further sets are produced. It would be nice to have these more easily available, in non-Lego stores for example.</p>
