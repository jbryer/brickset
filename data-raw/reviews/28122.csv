The biggest surprise coming to my mind when I open up the box, and I understand that the size was not right for her finger. The ring is open in down but the plastic is so hard that it can&#39;t really fit in her finger.</p>

<p>Super cute piceces are included, very nice idea, but ther&#39;s no way to test the size before to buy it.</p>
