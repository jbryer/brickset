<p>The lukes landspeeder is my second star wars bag charms to the star destroyer and like the star destroyer this is quite an impressive little build .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build is on a 2&times;3 modified light tan plate , with a 1&times;2 behind it and two modified plates at the back to attach a 1&times;1 light tan cone to the sides for the side thrusters ontop there is another 2&times;3 modified plate in light tan to get the sloped nose with a 2&times;2 light grey round tile underneath , a 1&times;2 dark grey cheese slope for the windshield , a 1&times;2 light tan grille is used for the seating area and the back has a snot on a jumper attaching another 1&times;1 light tan cone for a thruster .&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a pretty nice bag charm but the choice of light tan is a bit strange as the lukes landspeeder released in 2017 was in light nugat which was the year before this released , but Lego doesn&#39;t really make these pieces in light nugat so it really is just a cost saving measure but overall I recommend this set to any Lego star wars fan as this is just a harmless bag charm .</p>
