<p>For those who are unaware, this set was&nbsp;originally set&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21038-1/Las-Vegas"">21038-1</a>. It was replaced by this&nbsp;as a result of a re-design. The redesign involved the replacement of the original hotel due to a tragic event that took place at that hotel a month or two before it was supposed to be released. The sets were redesigned with a new hotel, however,&nbsp;a small number escaped into&nbsp;Africa.</p>

<p>As for this set, it is really well designed and it was a really fun build. The two hotels can be a bit repetitive to make, but they look great in the end. There are three printed parts in this set. The tile with Las Vegas printed on it, the Welcome to Las Vegas sign&nbsp;and the mummy headdress on the sphinx. The sign especially is really well detailed. Now some people have wondered why the sphinx doesn&#39;t have a print for the face. While that would have been a nice inclusion, it would have been too distracting. Our brains are programmed to recognize faces, so we would always focus on that over everything else should they have included it. All the other buildings are well built for this scale and really well detailed. Everything is secure and nothing seems to break off easily.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a really great set. It looks great when compared to the real buildings and it looks great when on display with the other skyline sets. If you can spare $40 to pick it up, I would recommend that you pick this up. If not for display, then for all the great pieces that are included.</p>
