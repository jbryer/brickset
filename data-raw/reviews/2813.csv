"A_Brickset_user","2002-10-13T00:00:00Z","","This has got to be the best set Lego has every made. At first glance I though it was just another truck, like the 5580 highway rig, but after a better look I came to realise how different it really is. The truck is 3 times the size of the 5580 truck, and pictured side by side makes the 5580 look like a baby. The 5580 roof is as high as the 5571s bonnet, and the length of the 5571 just falls short of the truck and trailer combined in the 5590 and 5591 sets. 
The detail of this set hasn't been spared. All down to the tools in the side compartments to the nice chrome exhausts. The seats have been made to great detail and the moving of them is simple, yet impressive. The big massive 6 by 4 doors are huge and the big wheels are great characteristic of the set. The detail off the engine is increased from the 5580 and as always the bonnet opens to show this. An added bonus is the sleeper cab, with its own train door access and two opeing roof tops. Alot of time and effort went into the design of this set, and has paid off. 
It took a massive 7 hours to build this set and 5 hours to build the second model. The second model, a transporter or something, is by itself a great model. I want to buy a second set just to have that one displayed as well.
I took one point away from a perfect 10 score for two features I believe would have made the set better. As everyone agrees, there should have been dual wheels on the back, bring the wheel count to 10. This is not to bad, but would have looked better. Adding two more is possible, but a slight rebuild of the back is required. The secind fault is no windows in the big doors. I think this would have made it just that little bit better, but other than that it is great. If only they still made sets like this, I would have endless days of building lego. 
If you can get a hold of a set, do so. It will be your best ever purchase.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-06T10:34:31Z","Best Model Team Set ever","History: I bought this set back in 1997. It ate up all my birthday money, because it was very expensive but well worth it. After Buying I started putting it it togetherI built it on 3 Days in a time of approximately 24h. In 1999 I dismantled it for the alternate and this year I rebuilt the main model again within 12 hours.
-----------------------------------------------------------
The Models:
1. The Transporter: This is a good model and somewhat shorter than the big truck itself.It has compact V6 and a kinda boxy design.There is no room for the driver to sleep. But there are some interior details. Like nice seats for the drivers and a coffee maker.The Cargo area is very roomy except for that damned tank in there.
-----------------------------------------------------------
2.The Big Rig: This is just the greatest truck ever made by LEGO.It has lots of details like a TV, a coffee maker, two nice seats,that are fitting Technic Figures.There's even a bed, which seems a little bit small for a Technic-Figure but I could be wrong. Well there are some places,which have many tools in it.And that Exhaust Pipes are just too great. I like the big V8-motor and the hood above it. Another great thing in that model is the detailed Back of the cab. With a ladder and some more chrome elements.The big doors are great ,too but where's the glass for them? There are only some minor flaws,like the very small wipers and the 4 wheels missing. But this doesn't lower my rating.

"Zamees","2007-03-07T16:19:44.72Z","Excellent Model","Still the best model team set that LEGO has produced.  Nice details.  Had to pay double the price for it on Ebay, but it was worth it, since this set is no longer produced.  If LEGO ever re-releases this set (as they have with the Hot Rod) I highly recommend getting one when you have the chance.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I bought this set a few days ago and my child-dream comes true. It is really awesome - size, pieces count, details... I build it with my disabled friend and he is gloating upon :o)

Well, does someone built a trailer for this truck? E.g. for carrying 5563 Racing truck, or 8439 Pneumatic Front End Loader which could be a nice couple...?

If you have some, or know someone, pls contact me...

"Alileighju","2009-03-30T23:05:21.92Z","Best Lego Set Ever","I got this set when I was about 9 years old and it took me a few nights to complete.

Throughout my life I continue to buy and collect many, many Lego sets including the Millennium Falcon (10179), the Big Technic Tow Truck (8285), the Discovery Space Shuttle (7470), Nitro Muscle (8146), Super car (8880) and the Black Cat Giant truck still reigns as the best set in my opinion, but maybe that's just due to the fact that this set has been with me for so long since I was a kid.

My truck is missing a few pieces and all the silver pieces have faded and become dusty but still I look at the truck with admiration as one of the best designed Lego sets ever. No detail is overlooked, from the interiors (coffee maker, bed, TV, movable seats and steering wheel, and tool cabinets) to the openable hood and the steering knob on the roof.

Many people are disappointed with the V8 engine which doesn't have moving pistons but I think it's great as it is as it is just a Model Team set not a Technic set which focuses on those things.

Overall, an absolutely, fantastically beautiful set with completely no cons at all.

I saw one available on eBay a few months ago so if you ever get an opportunity to bid on this set be prepared for a fight. It is a once in a lifetime set.
Super rare and extremely detailed.

It is a shame that Lego does not produce Lego sets of this quality anymore nowadays.

"darthdc","2009-09-02T16:46:38.827Z","Greatest Model Team set.","I bought this for my birthday some years ago (first time I'd shelled out £100 on a set!).
The price tag was steep, I admit, but once built, I realised I'd spent well.

The details are amazing - seats fold forward, bed, tv and coffee machine in back compartment and tools stored either side.

Pros

Around 18 inches long - it's huge
Chrome parts 
Overwhelming details

Cons

Stickers - some over multiple bricks (not good if you like rebuilding sets, like me)

I always thought that a trailer would go well with it. The place where a trailer would be hooked up can take a bit of weight. Have designed one, but getting the bricks maybe a problem.

Have tried to motorize it with 9v motors but the Black Cat is too heavy. Whether the PF motors will do better, I don't know. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Call it the granddaddy of today's VW camper.</div><div><br></div><div>It was certainly expensive - somewhere North of £100 in 1996, a time when few people could justify spending that much on a toy. This'll be why they're more than twice that now.</div><div><br></div><div>It's still worth it. The build is enjoyable, if straightforward - there are few fancy techniques here - but the finished item is just beautiful. This beauty goes more than skin deep; there's a very nice V8 display engine under that lift-up bonnet, some effort has been made to kit out the interior - right down to a coffee maker on the dash for the thirsty driver! - and the outside is festooned with what spaceship designers would call greebling. There's possibly a little too much of the latter, but it shows real exuberance on the part of this model's designers.</div><div><br></div><div>The chrome parts are rather lovely, too. Best of all, though, is the little Black Cat mascot on the bonnet from which this truck takes it's name.</div><div><br></div><div>As for functions, that's not really what this set is about, but it does steer (a bit, via the hand-of-god control on the roof) and the doors and bonnet open. Those doors are massive single piece items that were unique to this set, but I might have preferred a brick-built solution.</div><div><br></div><div>It's not perfect, mind. After the sheer over-the-top design of the cab, the rear end looks somewhat underdone. The rear wheels aren't doubles and they lack any more than a mild attempt at mudguards, making the back half look a little naked. The trailer hitch isn't the best either, and if you want to build something for it to haul you'll need to strengthen this part. Those wheels, by the way, may be hard to come by because they're not the same size as the similar looking ones in later sets - these are very slightly bigger.</div><div><br></div><div>Another source of mild irritation is the use of minifig levers for windscreen wipers - they are ridiculously small!</div><div><br></div><div>I've had a lot of fun with this model, helped by the fact that it's the right size for those poseable Technic figures Lego did at around the same time.

It's still my favourite model team set for the sheer amount of detail built into an old school studded model. This is one of the very few sets that I have left assembled for more than a few months. Normally I built it, play with it, look at the way it was built, then it goes into my parts bins. But I keep building this again just to look at it.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,4
