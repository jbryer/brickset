For collectors looking to get certain Minifigures and are willing to remove the key ring they are a great value for the asking price, but as a LEGO item they don&#39;t last very long.</p>

<p>Case in point, my BB-9E Key chain has completely lost its entire print. When I first purchased it the print was very nice, quite sharp, an excellent likeness to the droid from the film. After over a year of using it for my key chain the entire print has erased leaving a key chain with a small black plastic ball on the end of it.</p>

<p>It hasn&#39;t cracked or broken though, I&#39;ve heard many regular Minifigures can eventually lose arms and legs due to weathering, cracks and those sorts of things. BB-9E in comparison is the perfect character to make into a key chain. Despite the loss of print it won&#39;t break, so your little builders will have fun with using this as a key chain if they don&#39;t mind losing the print.</p>

<p>Solid item. Would recommend, but caution that prolonged use as a key chain in your pocket means the minifigure print will fade.</p>
