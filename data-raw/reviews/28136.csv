<p>Buffer as seen in Ninjago masters of Spinjitsu&nbsp;season eight &quot;The Sons of Garmadon&quot; is a very cool looking minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His details include a motorcycle jacket with the S.O.G skull printed on it, his bare &quot;buff&quot; arms, a tough looking fave with stubble dots on it, two katanas, a shield, and a helmet with night vision googles on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this charecter&nbsp;looks very true to the show, and is a must have for any die hard Ninjago colecter&nbsp;or anybody who wants to build their S.O.G gang. Now we just need to see Ninjago&nbsp; army builder sets kind like the Chima or Star Wars ones.&nbsp;</p>
