"claherre","2018-05-30T18:04:45.817Z","Set from a distant past...","<p>A small crane, from that era when the minifigs couldn&#39;t sit inside the truck or the crane cabin. Even as a kid I was confused with this issue. Anyway, the highlight with this set is the crane itself, you can operate it, so the playability is there. The minifig is a generic worker of that era, with the yellow jacket with stickers, and for me, this brings memories of summer days playing withi this set and two others I had with similar minifigs.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>- The crane</p>

<p>- Minifig</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>- Minifig can&#39;t sit inside any cabin</p>
