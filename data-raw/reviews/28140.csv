<p>As often, magazines gifts are quickly build, this one is no exception but the building is very interesting as some parts are rare and very well used. I would congratulate&nbsp;the designer.</p>

<p>Speaken on rare parts, I&#39;m please to found in a &lt;50 parts foil pack, such pieces as :</p>

<ul>
	<li>2&nbsp;BRICK 1X2X1 2/3 W/4 KNOBS&nbsp;(<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-22885"">22885</a>)</li>
	<li>2&nbsp;PLATE 1X3 W/ 2 KNOBS (<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-34103"">34103</a>)&nbsp;</li>
	<li>4<b>&nbsp;</b>PLATE W. BOW 1X2X2/3 (<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-11477"">11477</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>On playability I love the rotating head of the AT-ST.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a picture next to my other AT-ST.&nbsp;SW911837-1&nbsp;is actually a little bit taller.</p>
