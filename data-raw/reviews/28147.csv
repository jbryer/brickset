<p>After watching Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I could not help but wonder what Lego could do the Porg. They are an iconic symbol of Ahch-to and really made the movie. The speculations surrounding the model hyped the anticipation of the official release, making individuals, including myself, intrigued&nbsp;in what the model would look like or what the actions would be. Needless to say that my expectations were exceeded. It resembles a puffin, which is typically found in Ireland, where Ahch-to&nbsp;was filmed.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What I enjoyed about the set:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The actions built within the set were an incredible part of the model. By only pressing the little flab of tail in the back, the mouth opens wide and the&nbsp;wings flap up. It is amazing that after the one presses the flab in the back, the actions float down by gravity. This is such an essential portion of the model, since it makes for more time for the individual to keep playing with the model. It was an interesting mechanism to build and enjoyable when completed. It was simplistic yet effective in overall functionality. It is&nbsp;extremely realistic and makes the model come to life.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What I disliked about the set:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Though this may be particular, the only thin I disliked was the unrealistic look of the Porg. I realize the designers were focused on having the function of flapping wings and opening mouth, but they could have incorporated some more aesthetically realistic looks. By this, I mean that the Porg&nbsp;has a rounder belly and taller legs. The Puffin, which was the basis of the Porg, has tall and skinny legs, just like the CGI Porg. It would have been a complex to make the model with skinny legs, since it would not be able to support the weight of the model. Even though it is a miniscule flaw, I really do love this model.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Would&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em>I recommend this set?&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>I have been trying to decide what my favorite set of 2018 will be. I have not bought the set yet, but this model is up there. It is such a cute model and is integral in the fandom of Star Wars. Though I am not a huge fan, I really love the creatures within the universe. The Porg&nbsp;looks so amazing in person and the actions within the model make it so desirable. The model was so satisfying while building the Porg, which made the justification of purchasing it even more prevalent. The hype supported me purchasing it and extended my passion to UCS Star&nbsp;Wars sets. I highly recommend that anyone purchase this set. It fits in with any setting and is not distracting in any household.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

Fairly entertaining to build the mechanics that utilize the technic pieces. It can be a little repetitive at times but overall building this new unique figure is a good experience. The figure, once built is a blast to display. It is very very looking, to me and I am entertained every time I see it. The mouth opens and closes with the tail and it can be a lot of fun to play with. The feet can be fragile and fall off easily but other than that it is sturdy. Great piece that I wpuld recommend. Another plus is that a slight variation in lego piece colors can&nbsp; give you different porgs for an entire flock.</p>

"CaptainKindling","2020-09-26T17:15:11.643Z","The Porgs will be with you... always.","<p>This was a set which I was on the fence about for a long time. Sure it looks kinda cool, but I prefer the ships and other vehicles for my Star Wars Lego collection, and always found other things more worthy of my &pound;50ish. But I picked this up in the &quot;reduced to clear&quot; section after Christmas, and I have to say I was extremely impressed.<br />
Now Porgs seem to be a bit divisive - they&#39;re this generation&#39;s Ewoks, so the fans either love them or loathe them. If you hate Porgs anyway then you&#39;re really going to get nothing out of this set. If, on the other hand, you love the little critters, then read on!<br />
<br />
So first of all the build is broken down into 6 bags. As is the tendency with Star Wars Lego, these bags are sorted sequentially, so you build bag 1 in its entirety before moving onto bag 2 etc. The set totals in at just over 800 pieces, so it&#39;s a nice average-large build, and the build clocked in at just under 3 hours for myself as an adult, if only on a technicality.<br />
The first thing I have to say about the set is that it&#39;s frankly a work of design genius by the boffins at Lego. I&#39;ve built 16 Star Wars Lego sets prior to this one, and you can always get a rough idea of how it&#39;s going to come together from the outset, but to make a large scale model of an organic, feathered creature out of bricks really is impressive.<br />
The first bag of the build is very much along the Technic Lego lines, so expect lots of pegs slotting into holes. This forms the core of the Porg, and the following bags are more traditional Lego builds where the chest, wings, back and head all come together to attach to that central frame.<br />
One thing which will delight a lot of fans is that there are no stickers, aside from the large one which goes on the Ultimate Collectors Series-stlye information plaque. Instead, all of the intricate detailing on the Porg comes from custom feathery pieces, or small one-square pieces. Lots, and lots, and lots of small pieces!<br />
This is the only reason I&#39;m taking a star off and not giving it a full 5 - although the box does suggest an age range of 9-14, I think builders on the younger end of that range might find it a bit fiddly. As Lego tend to do, they kindly provide a few spares of some of the most commonly used and easily lost pieces, but even I found myself sighing heavily in places, so youngsters with a little less patience may get frustrated.<br />
<br />
Once it&#39;s built, it&#39;s a fantastic looking figure. Obviously this isn&#39;t going to be as interactive as something like an X-Wing Fighter, but the ability to make the Porg open its mouth and flap its wings slightly at the press of its tail is a nice touch. Definitely more of a display piece than a play item.<br />
The mini-Porg which comes with the plaque is also a fun little addition. Admittedly I would have preferred it a bit more like a mini figure, like the BB-8, but instead it&#39;s made up of a custom headpiece and then a body made up of various standard Lego bricks. Still, he&#39;ll be most welcome in my Lego Millennium Falcon to keep Chewie company!</p>
