While I do find the sets themed balance very strange its is non the less a very entertaining, affordable and interesting one. With 4 mini-figures and two... one and a half mech builds with enough variation in the build to distinguish it from previous Bat-mechs&nbsp;as well as providing much much needed relief from the constant barrage of Bat-Vehicles in every single Batman set.</p>

<p>Mini-figures</p>

<p>Batman - While he may appear basic this variation which has minor differences is currently only available in this set,&nbsp;with&nbsp;the 2018 style blue - grey torso with gold printed belt. Basic yet iconic although I personally prefer the darker colour variations of the character.</p>

<p>Flash - Feeling very very out of place in this set, the worlds fastest man appears finally with some printed legs to include his groovy boots as well as an updated torso with slight variations in colour. Very confused why he appears in this set which is entirely Batman themed and related. Would rather have got an updated Robin figure or a much wanted Red Robin figure which would have suited this more.</p>

<p>Poison Ivy - A huge downgrade considering how detailed and stunning the Lego Batman Movie variant was. Very bland mini-figure, no leg printing, no&nbsp;hair printing and basic torso printing with little to no detail or interesting tid-bits to catch your eye. I get that the Movie design was technically from a different line... but come on.. honestly if it ain&#39;t broke don&#39;t fix it and there&#39;s no excuse to not re-use existing assets if they are superior. May be a cost thing, but from a consumers perspective this is just terrible.</p>

<p>Firefly - The main reason to get this set, Garfield Lynns AKA Firefly makes his debut appearance. The black and yellow work fantastically together to really make this figure stand out. While it would have been nice to again get a bit more detail in the prints I cant complain to much as at least we actually have him appearing. Plain black legs and a new helmet design which.. is ok but i would rather have had a more detailed molded helmet than a more basic printed one.. however I do understand that the idea is they can reuse this mold&nbsp;in other sets where as a more detailed mold may not provide as much re-usability. Firefly also comes with a pretty chunky jet-pack and his flame thrower which works really well with the new blast accessories to create a really cool looking flame and explosion effect during play.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Builds</p>

<p>Bat-Mech is a cool new design, love the spinning blade on the arm, seems a little violent even for Batman but as long as Bat-Fleck doesn&#39;t get hold of it im sure it will only be used for slicing vines and not people. The mech looks cool and articulation is ok but the hands could have benefited from a ball joint connection to articulate more rather then only a technic-pin connection allowing it to only swivel. I personally prefer this design to previous Mechs and its definitely my favourite Batman one being reminiscent of the mech from the comics. Also has a retracting net launcher and stud shooter.. not being funny but this mech could take both villains in this set alone.. adding a super powered speedster to this is just over-kill.</p>

<p>Poison Ivy&#39;s.. mech? Bio-mech? Whatever it is, actually looks ok.. in a minimalist sort of way. Its nice to get Ivy in a set that also demonstrates some of her power beyond holding a single vine or a vine wheelchair. While feeble looking when compared to the Bat-Mech this could still be imposing and interesting in other situations. armed with stud shooters and the ability to.. fall down this adds a little more interest to Ivy herself as well as her playability.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Accessories</p>

<p>Nothing stands out too much here, flame blast accessories which as mentioned before really add a new dimension when playing with characters such as Firefly, Bat-cessories which include the new inferior Batarang design&nbsp;as well as Bat-shields etc used in the Mech build, a net for the net launcher and then a classic Batarang for good measure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall some great opportunity for play, and enough interesting stuff going on to make some additions to any collection or play set. Would have been nicer to get a more imposing mech for Ivy and a different more in theme figure to replace Flash.</p>

<p>I do pity Ivy, as out of all the people to pair her with they pair her with Firefly an insane&nbsp;pyromaniac.. so not only does she have a huge billion dollar deforestation mech piloted by the worlds greatest detective and&nbsp;the worlds fastest man to contend with she also has to watch over her should has Garfield blasts napalm over her shoulder. Sorry Ivy, just go home and let Firefly take the beating, its not worth it.</p>

The dual molded legs on flash and the firefly figs are both exclusive but i mainly bought it so it could fight the lex luthor mech from last year. the mech has HORRIBLE playability, there is no where to grab it without breaking a piece off of it and it is very fragile. however, i grew up watching &quot;The Batman&quot; and this is the first set inspired by the series so... kinda worth it</p>

"BengalsBrix","2022-11-24T00:03:28.657Z","One of the Most lopsided sets I have!","<p>Terrible build, very good figures:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BUILD: The main build of this set is the Batman mech which overall has many flaws... with a couple of intended play features such as:</p>

<p>Moveable angling cannon with Web that shoots</p>

<p>Rotating bladed disk</p>

<p>Moveable fingers</p>

<p>And perhaps the coolest part is the way you can position the Batman minifigure</p>

<p>The chest opens up and you attach him, And its completed with the famous Batman logo, which is a very nice piece...</p>

<p>Sooooo set sounds quite nice so far, right?</p>

<p>Wrong.</p>

<p>The legs are very flimsy and it topples extremely easily,&nbsp;</p>

<p>For me at least the cannon is basically non-functional, it doesn&#39;t really hold the red web properly, and it falls off often and when it stays it BARELY fires.</p>

<p>The rotating blade is OK i guess.</p>

<p>I do like all the Batman logos featured prominently all across the mech, however the overall flimsiness of it causes me to give the mech portion of the set a lowly</p>

<p>2/10</p>

<p>It&#39;s got some nice play features but when It&#39;s teetering over and breaking&nbsp;every 5 seconds it hard to enjoy them..</p>

<p>&nbsp;That is The lowest rating iv ever given to a build</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now for the possibly redeeming factor....</p>

<p>The MINIFIGURES:</p>

<p>First off, all Minifigures are exclusive so a nice plus</p>

<p>FLASH: Very nice figure, leg dual mould print wraps around the whole figure. Torso is very nice, with some shiny gold sparkle to it&nbsp;on the front part of the torso and the back.</p>

<p>BATMAN: Grey torso and pants so a nice change, pretty decent fig, no crazy prints, but has a cape and some good back printing,&nbsp;</p>

<p>POISON IVY W/ BUILD: probably the second most chased fig in the set, poison ivy has come in only 5 sets i belive in standard mini figure&nbsp;form, and 2 of those are the lego batman movie sets, so not a common character in lego form, with a nice tree build as a stand...</p>

<p>She has some downs though which are no prints on hair and especially with the Lego Batman Movie variant having such nice hair, it&#39;s a shame, it&#39;s a pretty basic figure but i like it and am glad i have it</p>

<p><strong>FIREFLY: The best figure and the main reason for purchasing probably this figure is nicely done with a nice jetpack as well, and an orange disk stand!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Only downsides i can see are the lack of arm printing and pant printing but i love the vibrant yellow!</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Verdict:</strong></p>

<p><strong>This depends heavily on if you like the character firefly as he comes in only this set. For me the figures are a solid 8.5/10</strong></p>

<p><strong>But the mech is a 2/10</strong></p>

<p><strong>Personally i won it on ebay and I am making this review years after release AND retirement, 11-23-2022</strong></p>

<p><strong>As of now the figures are somewhat cheap, Firefly being around 9$ and flash being about 17$ which is the most expensive in the set, and poison ivy without the build about 6$ and last the Batman being based around only 4$.. so hats a total sum of about 36$ without shipping so...</strong></p>

<p><strong>i got it for cheap, a little under 20, and it was missing like 8 pieces to the mech which i replaced so...</strong></p>
