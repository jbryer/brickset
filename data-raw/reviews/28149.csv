"BrickLifeCrisis","2018-07-18T20:01:08.43Z","Great part selection and a good value!","<p>This polybag&nbsp;consists of 40 pcs including a young Harry, his cart,&nbsp;the owl and his cage. Harry&#39;s accessories include a suitcase,&nbsp;wand,&nbsp;cauldron and a spell book with printed 1x2 tile &quot;page&quot; inside.&nbsp; The print on Harry&#39;s torso is a nice representation of his school uniform.&nbsp; The detail is quite nice.&nbsp; His face print is also very good complete with the requisite bills and scar. He includes the non-possible adolescent legs (unlike the new CMF series) .The builds are simple but effective.&nbsp; A spare wand is also included. At $4 US (available at Target), it is a good value and an easy an inexpensive way to start your Lego Wizarding World collection. Happy Building!</p>

"brendo612","2018-08-17T15:22:49.96Z","Found @ Target, 16 Aug 2018","<p>I found this poly-bag&nbsp;near the checkouts at Target (Kalamazoo West, Mi), hidden behind a row of Lego&nbsp;Batman poly-bags. It was the only one left.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I recommend checking all checkout aisles, and look behind the other Lego poly-bags&nbsp;to check that it isn&#39;t hidden back there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So keep looking, you may get lucky.</p>

<p>As for the set, it&#39;s great. The cauldron has a silver&nbsp;shine, and Hedwig looks fantastic too.&nbsp;</p>

"iwybs","2018-11-05T02:35:09.7Z","Good value for adults and children alike","<p>I bought this because the Whomping Willow set only includes two minifigures&nbsp;in school robes, so the Gryffindor triumvirate cannot all wear school robes at once without this extra figure.&nbsp; Like most polybags&nbsp;that include minifigures, there&#39;s not much of a building experience to speak of and what you see is what you get in terms of playability, but this set includes a lot of great parts.&nbsp; For the price of a single CMF, you get a minifigure&nbsp;(more on that later), an owl with nice printing of feathers and eyes, one of the new book assemblies with a nicely printed &quot;Wingardium Leviosa&quot; tile, a cauldron, a suitcase, and a good assortment of chandelier pieces, telescopes, apollo studs, and round 2x2 jumper plates.&nbsp; None of the minifigure parts are exclusive to this polybag, but this is the only set besides Hogwarts Great Hall in which they come in this combination.&nbsp; The minifigure is printed with some fine red and gold stripes at the top and bottom of the torso to represent his House colors, with a nicely detailed red and gold necktie at the top.&nbsp; The head comes with two prints, one a calm smiling face and the other a wide-eyed scared face.&nbsp; Both faces are cute and simple while representing young Daniel Radcliffe very well.&nbsp; The best part is the lightning scar just above the right eyebrow.&nbsp; It&#39;s small, subtle, and easy to miss, and it&#39;s placed high enough that the head can easily be reused for different characters simply by using a hairpiece that covers up the scar, while the new hairpiece designed for this year&#39;s Harry Potter line includes a gap in the hairline that looks entirely natural but shows off the scar quite distinctly.&nbsp; It&#39;s a very well-designed mold.</p>

<p>From a perspective of parts and value, then, this set is great.&nbsp; From a perspective of role-playing, it&#39;s a great way to get Harry and then let your imagination go wild.&nbsp; From a perspective of scenes covered, it represents the King&#39;s Cross scenes of&nbsp;<em>Philosopher&#39;s Stone</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Chamber of Secrets</em>&nbsp;pretty well.&nbsp; Finally, it makes a great gift for the little ones in your life.&nbsp; (That&#39;s what Lego is really all about, right?)&nbsp; So don&#39;t miss this polybag, if you can get it in Walmart for RRP.&nbsp; If you can&#39;t, skip it.&nbsp; It&#39;s great, but not something you need to go out of your way to get if it&#39;s not easily available in your area.</p>

"vikings","2019-01-02T04:43:32.377Z","Amazing Polybag!","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The set comes in a normal polybag&nbsp;and the has the normal size instructions that you get in the polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You get a lot of great parts in this polybag. You get Harry&#39;s Owl Hedwig, a cauldron, book, and a briefcase. The total piece count for the set is 40.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You only get a younger version of Harry (probably from the Scorers Stone). He comes with a pair of dark brown wands. I love the new wand molds compared to the old brown sticks that they used in the old Harry Potter sets.&nbsp;They have given a different hair piece from older Harry Potter sets. His shirt is the classic Hogwarts Gryffindor&nbsp;shirt (I may be wrong). He also comes with a doubled sided head.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The build was really quick and easy took me under 2 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:</strong></p>

<p>Once I finished it I was really happy I got this set. It such a great polybag. It represents Harry on his first trip to Hogwarts really well. And all the cool and unique pieces are great. And getting Hedwig&nbsp;is an added bonus as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>My overall opinion is that this is an amazing polybag. What you get for 4 dollars is great. You get the cart with cauldron, book, briefcase, and Hedwig. The Harry Potter figure is well done as well and I love the new wand molds. They are so much better than the old sticks used in the old Harry Potter sets. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"1947andallthat","2018-08-26T21:08:00.923Z","You don't need this, but why not?","<p>This set came as a free gift at Leicester Square&#39;s Hogwarts signing event, a welcome relief for those of us in countries without Walmart. But is it actually worth paying for?</p>

<p><b>Packaging</b></p>

<p>We&#39;ve got a standard polybag&nbsp;here, with a single sheet of instructions.</p>

<p><b>The Build</b></p>

<p>Not much to say, really. Knock together a minifigure, cage and trolley,&nbsp;<em>et voila.</em></p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Again, not much to say here. Other than the parts used in the new-style book, the only piece with any rarity is the &quot;Titanium Metallic&quot; cauldron, found in six other sets.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>This is where we generate some interest. This young&nbsp;<strong>Harry Potter</strong>&nbsp;in uniform can&#39;t be found anywhere else outside the Great Hall, and he looks spectacular. The short black legs and dark grey&nbsp;torso have been given enough printed detail to represent Harry&#39;s Gryffindor uniform perfectly, with a tie, a stripe along the waist&nbsp;and some creasing. His double-sided head - one side smiling, the other screaming - looks good, and the scar can be seen perfectly through a small parting in Harry&#39;s new hairpiece, which looks fantastic. A simple dark brown wand comes with him.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p><strong>Hedwig&#39;s cage&nbsp;</strong>may look ridiculously oversized, but it&#39;s worth it for the detailing. The shape looks fantastic, and the gold detailing scattered throughout looks lovely. Hedwig herself remains unchanged from the classic range, but she looks perfect. Her wings are moulded&nbsp;with plenty of feathers, her printed eyes and prominent beak look superb, and the printed feathers across her chest look perfect. However, it is impossible to properly position her without taking the top off the cage.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>luggage trolley</strong>&nbsp;is a much simpler and better scaled build, with a handle, a secure slot for luggage and two pairs of wheels; these are completely static, but look fine on display. The luggage itself is more interesting; a plain dark red brick represents some luggage for the front, and a dark cauldron can be perched on top. A plain black old-style briefcase is included, which is slightly disappointing, although I don&#39;t think the new-style case can actually fit on the trolley. The new style book looks more impressive, with moulded bindings, and opens up to reveal a printed page demonstrating the technique required to cast Wingardium&nbsp;Leviosa. The&nbsp;whole cart looks okay on the whole.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>This is pretty good on the whole. The trolley may lack some inspiration, but the new book is worth having, the cage is good looking, and both Harry and Hedwig look superb. But would I pay for this, considering that I can get everything else elsewhere?</p>

<p>Well, I think the Great Hall looks ugly, so yes. If you think it looks good, though, skip this. Save for 71043, which I might be ready to review in a couple of months, unless 6020 pieces go by in a flash.</p>

"ChocolateCyborg","2019-01-01T19:30:03.143Z","Harry's Journey to Hogwarts","<p>I was extremely happy when I&nbsp;heard that Lego was coming out with a harry potter polybag and it did not disappoint me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Bag and instructions</strong></p>

<p>The instructions and bag are like every other polybag instructions and bag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifgures</strong></p>

<p>Harry Potter (and hedwig if you count her as a minfigure).</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>First off you get Hedwigs cage, it is a nice size and Harry can hold the cage in his hand if you would like to do that (he can only hold the trolley and his wand or the trolley and the cage). Now you have the trolley, you get a suitcase, a cauldron, and a book with the wingardium&nbsp;leviosa spell (which can fit in or on the trolley).</p>

<p><b>Summary</b></p>

<p>Overall I&nbsp;think that this polybag&nbsp;was very well designed and definitely worth the money.</p>

"LegoHobbitFan","2019-08-23T21:54:26.88Z","A Magical Set!","<p>Retail price: $3.99</p>

<p>Parts: 40</p>

<p>Build: Being a polybag, it&#39;s a pretty simple build and should just take a minute or two.</p>

<p>Parts: This is where the set really shines. We get 40 pieces, which is pretty good for the set, but there are also quite a few cool ones. We get a black suitcase, a book, a pair of wands on a sprue, a cauldron, and best of all,&nbsp;a white owl to represent Hedwig. Beyond this&nbsp;there are quite a few other helpful parts to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: There is just one minifigure, Harry Potter. He is a decent fig, nothing special but not bad. He does come in a couple other sets though which lessens his value.</p>

<p>Play value: This is a pretty good set for play. There are no bad guys or anything, but you get the main character of the series and his pet, along with a couple models (a trolley and a bird cage for Hedwig) which allow for quite a few play scenarios. The trolley contains room for some of the accesories, although It is worth noting that the wheels don&#39;t turn.</p>

<p>Display value: it isn&#39;t a super awesome display piece on its own, but could be used to bulk out larger Harry Potter scenes. The bird cage in particular looks pretty impressive.</p>

<p>Overall: An awesome set, excellent value. If your in it for the parts then you definetly won&#39;t be dissapointed!</p>
