"chrisvs28","2007-07-31T16:34:54.597Z","Back in time","2 weeks ago during the Formule 1 grand Prix of Europe 2007 (Nurburgring) I rebuild this set. It was its second rebuild. The truck was dusty after standing 5 years in my room at my parants home. I took everything apart and cleaned it. Some white parts turned a bit yellow. Wich is a shame. But the set is 20 years old so who can blame lego.
I build this set a week after building the Ferrari Enzo set (8653).
And compared to that its really back in time. Really easy to build but nice to do. Off course the technics are old but really ahead of its time. It like driving a 20 year old BMW. Old, nice and really ahead of its time. I enjoyed it to play with the parts. And I'm happy to still have this set cause I have the 5540 F1 car to. Both stand together old but proud. I will take care of the better now.   ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"kari","2007-11-25T07:34:15.39Z","Rules the highway","<p>Although I have the 5571 Black Cat in my collection, I take the risk to say that 5580 Highway Rig is the most attractive piece of the legendary Model Team series. To tell the truth it is perfect in every way. It&nbsp;looks like a Kenworth or Peterbilt truck from the 1980s. Nowadays LEGO rarely create such impressive, highly-detailed, playable (!) and show-case demanding models like this one.<br />
<br />
The aesthetic is beyond all praise. From a distance it looks real and I love the colour combination of it (much better than 5571&#39;s colours) which deliciously characterises the rig&#39;s exterior. This model was released in time when LEGO did not skimp the wheels: it has all the 10 (unlike&nbsp;5571) + the spare tyre. In the cabin there is everything that needed: a huge steering wheel, dashboard, gear lever and a little sleeping room in the back. The doors, the roof panels and the hood can be opened. Inside the hood we find an elaborated massive&nbsp;V8 engine with cooling fan. The rig has rearview-mirrors and all the authentic decorative pieces. Of course the 5571 is detailed more than this one but that is much bigger.<br />
<br />
The functions are great. The steering works well by using the spare tyre. The rear axles have a funny shock-absorver imitation that I haven&#39;t seen in any other model.<br />
<br />
5580 and 5590 were the most wanted Model Team sets in my childhood. These ultimate rigs represent the classic time when LEGO was really really cool.</p>

"Duq","2010-03-18T21:34:03.75Z","A classic that stood the test of time","I recently built this set again so I thought I'd share my views here. I found my copy in 2001 in a shop in Germany, still for the original 1986 price. Such finds are now extremely rare so if you want to buy a new copy now you need deep pockets...<br>Look at this model today and you see an impressive and detailed model of an American truck. Then remind yourself of the available parts back in 1986 and it's even more impressive. Back then there were no curved parts other than macaroni bricks.<br>When you build this set now you'll notice how different the instructions looked in those days. This 637 piece model takes 36 steps on 18 pages to build. Compare that to set 4955, the Big Rig. That 550 piece model from 2007 takes 53 steps on 61 pages...<br>SNOT was not used in sets in 1986 other than for lights and mirrors. That makes building quite straightforward. Still there's a lot of detail. Unlike its bigger brother the Black Cat this truck does have double wheels on its rear axles. There's a nice engine under the hood which of course opens. The cab doors open and there's even a bed in the sleeper cab.<br>Best of all though is the clever steering system, operated by the spare wheel on the back of the cab.<br>It has a good bunch of parts for its time. If you're to buy one now it still has an interesting selection of parts but for a different reason. First of all the printed doors and panels are unique. It's got old style finger hinges, the nice flat ones that were replaced by those bulky click-hinges. There's the nice compact steering system that hasn't been used in sets since 2004 and last but not least that big windscreen that hasn't been produced since '97.<br><br>This is a classic Lego set. It looks great, it's a fun build, there's lots of parts for alternative models and it's very playable.<br>Get one if you can!<br>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,4

It has been assembled for 22 years and still (minus the dust) looks as impressive as it did to me back then. The steering feature was awesome, and everything is really really proportional. Nice job guys.

"omnius","2019-03-25T23:49:20.27Z","Impressive big rig","<p>When the Model Team line launched in 1986, it brought an unprecedented level of detail to Lego sets. While it harked back to classic sets like #395 1909 Rolls-Royce, it introduced Technic steering and a finer level of detail than any sets that came before it.</p>

<p>Released four years later in the UK, 5580 was a popular set at the time and it&#39;s not hard to see why! Crammed with detail including an engine beneath the hinged bonnet, opening doors, wing mirrors and windscreen wipers - at the time we hadn&#39;t quite seen anything like it.</p>

<p>Nowadays such features are commonplace in larger Creator sets, but this was a groundbreaking set at the time. The build is satisfyingly complex, employing lots of small parts for detail. Being such a large vehicle limits playability, but this is definitely intended more as a high-end display piece. In that regard it&#39;s an imposing build, and one I highly recommend tracking down.</p>
