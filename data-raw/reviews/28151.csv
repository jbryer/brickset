Is it worth tracking down if you missed it? More than likely if you want every unique Unikitty facial prints.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Awesome giveaway with some fun builds and a cute looking unique Unikitty design.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Special Unikitty Sticker Sheet included for additional detailing to decorate Unikitty&rsquo;s room.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Cardboard Element sturdy and includes a very nice looking design showing Unikitty&rsquo;s house.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Crab element included in set.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Cardboard element difficult to fold just right to ensure tabs line up with slots.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Models sit loosely around Cardboard element, lack of stable baseplate may cause models or elements to be lost over time.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set features some nice builds, the sofa model is a large colourful model that Unikitty can sit on fairly nicely. The aquarium model is a bit lacking since it isn&rsquo;t completely enclosed, but it is serviceable. Unikitty has a breathtakingly cute new open smile closed eyes facial print that just looks awesome and is only available in this set. I&rsquo;d recommend this one for fans of the Cloud Cuckoo Land spokes-kitty.</p>
