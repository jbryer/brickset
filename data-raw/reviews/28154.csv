"Minifig290","2019-02-28T22:17:18.747Z","Wizardingly Awesome Series Part 1","<p>Hello all, today im going to be reviewing the whole complete Harry Potter collectable minifigures released August 2018 for &pound;2.99/$3.99 each having between 5 and 10 parts each giving a price per part of 59p to 29p/ 39c to 79c. There are 22 figures to collect who come packaged in a mystery foil bag with one per bag, to collect the whole series would cost &pound;65.78/$87.78.</p>

<p>Each figure come with a checklist and a unprinted black minifigure base plate plus almost every character in this series have a set of wands that come on a sprue and have two on. These wands can be held on a small ball joint meaning the wand has more moving and fun potential.</p>

<p>Lets look at each figure, with a rating out of 100% based on my opinion, in order of the checklist. I will review the first 16 figures in this review they are all the Harry Potter characters, and then I will review the 6 Fantastic Beast in another review that will be linked once done.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures &amp; Accessories</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Harry Potter</strong></p>

<p>Firstly we are going to look at Harry Potter who has 7 pieces, He has a common medium length black hair piece that sits on his single printed flesh face with his glasses, happy mouth, wide eyes and his iconic lighting shaped scar. His torso shows his Hogwarts uniform, with a dark gray jumper underneath, that continues onto his short movable legs that are new to this series, they are a little bigger than the short legs with a hing for the legs to move like the normal full sized part.</p>

<p>Harry has two accessories, a set of dark brown wands and Hedwig, who is printed onto a white owl mold last seen in the 2010 Harry Potter Theme, that shows his feathers, yellow eyes and black nose.</p>

<p>Harry gets a 84% for me as i like Hedwig and Harry&#39;s uniform but everything else to me isn&#39;t quite useful.</p>

<p><strong>2. Hermione Granger</strong></p>

<p>Now Hermione who also has 7 pieces, Her hair sadly isn&#39;t the one included with the Great Hall but it is a common mold with the brown long hair seen in other colours for the series 5 Fitness Instructor. Hermione&#39;s single sided face is a basic smile with light pink lipstick and open eyes. Like Harry, Hermione is in her Hogwarts uniform with one button on her cloak being buttoned up but leaving a few gaps to allow her dark gray jumper to pop through. Finally for the figure, she has the medium legs with a continuation of her cloak.</p>

<p>Hermione has two accessories, a set of brick yellow wands and a cat that i don&#39;t know the name of, this cat is ginger and has print on it face with a pink nose and 3 brown markings on its forehead.</p>

<p>Hermione gets a 70% as there is not many draws apart form her cat and hair but all else to me is quite useless</p>

<p><b>3. Ron Weasley</b></p>

<p>Ron Weasley like the other two so far has 7 parts, He has the awesome Han Solo hair in orange which is extremely useful, his face though is useless to me with a casual emotionless mouth and wide eyes with orange eye brows. Ron&#39;s cloak like Harry&#39;s and Hermione&#39;s goes onto his torso and legs with the Hogwarts logo, but under his cloak on his torso is a white school shirt with a Hogwarts red and yellow tie.</p>

<p>Ron has two accessories, a set of light brown wands and the rat ,who i also have no idea to what his name is, who uses a new rat piece first seen in the Arctic City sets for Summer 2018 in a dark yellow colour.</p>

<p>Ron gets a high 92% as i love his hair and accessories and Hogwarts uniform</p>

<p><b>4. Draco Malfoy</b></p>

<p>Next up is Draco Malfoy who has 9 parts, he has a nice smooth hair piece in light yellow that sits on his unimpressed face that is single sided. He has a dark green cape that is made from the new softer material for capes. Draco&#39;s torso is on a dark green torso and has the Slytherin house logo and wrinkles in his cloak. His legs are unprinted small white legs.</p>

<p>Draco has three accessories, a set of dark brown wands, a exclusive golden Snitch piece and a dark green broom.</p>

<p>Draco gets a 70% as he only has a few useful parts like his cape and hair and broom but everything else to me is useless.</p>

<p><strong>5. Luna Lovegood</strong></p>

<p>Now here is one of my favorites, its Luna Lovegood who has 9 parts, Luna&#39;s light yellow hair is using a long mold that could be new or might have been in the Big Band Theory set from 2015, Her face has a slight frown with bubblegum pink lipstick. Her bubblegum pink torso shows her buttoned shirt with pockets and a few wrinkles and she is using a pair of unprinted medium legs in blue, between her legs and torso is a awesome fabric skirt that has love hearts, horses, stars and birds. Now her head is double sided so her other face print has some metallic golden goggles with one lens being shiny pink and the other shiny blue.</p>

<p>Luna has three accessories, a set of light brown wands, a 2x3 light blue tile with &quot;THE QUIBBLER&quot; printed alongside a eagle with shiny print in certain areas of the tile and she also has purple purse that can go over her shoulder to her legs</p>

<p>Luna gets a well deserved 96% as i love her mid-legs, skirt, torso, accessories and hair.</p>

<p><strong>6. Neville Longbottom</strong></p>

<p>Neville Longbottom comes next with 9 parts, He has a extremely useful hair piece a short dark brown hair with dark yellow headphones, this mold was first seen with the Series 8 DJ minifigure. His double sided head on one side shows a slightly worried expression with wide eyes while the other shows what i believe him being possessed with hiss eyes closed and mouth frowning but i could be wrong there. He has a tan torso with a wrinkled full shirt that has a pocket, his legs are just some unprinted black mid-legs.</p>

<p>Neville has 3 accessories a set of light brown wands, a dark orange bucket that has been used as CMF Halloween candy buckets, and finally for this figure he has a new mold for a what looks like to be a potato with a face print on top of that is a light green stalk with leafs that was used later on for the Giraffe figure in the LEGO Movie 2.</p>

<p>Neville gets a high 92% as i love everything apart form the face.</p>

<p><b>7. Cho Chang</b></p>

<p>Cho Chang has 8 parts, Cho&#39;s hair is a soft rubbery piece that has long hair at the front and back, her darker head has a chipper smile with pink lipstick, her torso is a dark gray Hogwarts jumper that has a few creases on the back and front. Her legs are the same as Neville&#39;s but between her legs and torso is a unprinted fabric in dark gray for a skirt.</p>

<p>Cho has 2 accessories, a set of light brown wands and a dark nougat owl that has a tan feather pattern with some tan and dark brown marking on its face with yellow eyes ad a black nose.</p>

<p>Cho gets a 70% as i don&#39;t find much to celebrate about maybe apart from her skirt and owl and maybe her torso.</p>

<p><strong>8. Dean Thomas</strong></p>

<p>Dean Thomas has 8 pieces, his hair is Finn&#39;s bumpy hair from Star Wars in a dark brown that was seen with the Series 17 Gladiator. His single sided face is on a dark nougat and shows him smiling. Now his Gryffindor uniform is very patriotic to his house with a dark red and yellow scarf going from his neck to the top of his mid-legs, in the corner of his torso is the Gryffindor logo.</p>

<p>Dean has 2 accessories, a set of dark brown wands and a single sided printed flag that shows the Gryffindor logo, the flag is on a light brown minifigure sized bar.</p>

<p>Dean gets a 85% as i love his Gryffindor theme all over, and his hair is a nice part to get.</p>

<p><strong>9. Lord Voldemort</strong></p>

<p>Lord Voldemort has 6 parts, his bold white head piece shows his yellow eyes with a face of displeasure with wrinkles surrounding the face, his dark green ropes spills onto his legs form his torso that has some wrinkles, his legs are the new skirt piece first introduced in the Star Wars Han Solo movie set in April 2018.</p>

<p>Voldemort has two accessories, a set of white wands and a new mold for Nagini, Voldemort&#39;s snake, this mold is longer then Voldemort is in high and has only one place where a figure could hold him and that at the bottom of the snakes sand green body.</p>

<p>Voldemort gets a 79% as i love Nagini the snake and Voldemort is cool but nothing that get me excited.</p>

<p><strong>10. Dobby</strong></p>

<p>Dobby has 6 parts, his new molded head is made of a soft rubbery material same a that used for Cho&#39;s hair and Voldemort&#39;s snake, this head mold has a pointy noes and Dobby&#39;s elf ears. This new head has print for his eyes and mouth unlike th last Dobby where these where just indented and quite creepy. Dobby body has a tattered and dirty tan shirt with his body showing through and having bare arms and his double molded short legs are extremely useful.</p>

<p>Unlike most figures in this series Dobby only has two accessories and there isn&#39;t a set of wands but a cool new book mold first introduced in 2016 with a 1x2 tile showing a dark gray sock.</p>

<p>Dobby gets a 92% as i love this figure in general and his book is awesome along with the sock print.</p>

Twelaweny&#39;s torso and skirt legs are in sand green and show a dress with some dull gold pattern over the two parts and on the skirt legs is another pattern halfway to the bottom.</p>

<p>Twelawney has three accessories, a set of dark brown wand and a two piece cup and plate, the cup is very shallow and has a little handle for a figure to hold it and the plate is a little wider than a normal 1x1 round stud with a nice printed pattern around the rim of the element.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>Before i do the overall, i will do the six fantastic beast characters in a separate review.</p>

<p>For someone like me who has no interest in the Harry Potter franchise i was surprised to like this series as it is jam packed with great parts from Harry&#39;s cloak to Tralawney&#39;s Cup and Plate, with only a few duds in the series.</p>

<p>I recommend this series to anyone who has any interest in the Harry Potter universe as they will enjoy some of the references LEGO have included, also for &pound;3/$4 you get a nice little figure in each pack.</p>

<p><strong>Pros - </strong>Great new parts for minifigures, Fantastic accessories, Some really useful hair pieces, Tralawney, Dobby, Lovegood</p>

<p><strong>Cons - </strong>Some poor price per part for some of the figures</p>
