There is nothing very special about it but it is a nice assortment of parts that are great for building jungles and gardens. This set is great for the parts and it&#39;s cool to own the first set with the new plastic but there isn&#39;t much you can do with this alone.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this overall is a very enjoyable add-on set and perfect for building your own creations.</p>

Now clearly these bricks are still plastic, so don&rsquo;t go throwing them in the ocean, but these used plants rather than oil to manufacture them. So they are replacing non-renewable resources with renewables, I hope they are also planting new trees to replace the ones they used.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set isn&rsquo;t so much a set, but rather a collection of parts. Don&rsquo;t expect to be able to build anything with this set alone, you won&rsquo;t. But assuming this isn&rsquo;t your first Lego set these are very useful parts for creating forests or even just some green around a house.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My only disappointment was that the pine trees are small ones, smaller than a minifigure, unlike the ones that they produced in the 80&rsquo;s that were larger than minifigures. I was hoping to replace some lost ones from my childhood, oh well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I do recommend this set if you can find it for cheap and can use the parts.&nbsp;</p>

The set in question is just one big plant parts pack. So there isn&rsquo;t a lot to discuss here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The box is a small typical LEGO package in ordinary yellow with green plants and the made from plants logo printed on the front. A small hot air balloon is shown in the background, overall it&rsquo;s a very nice simple package design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Inside is a fold out pamphlet detailing the revolutionary new method of creating plastic LEGO elements using Sugarcane. This is in multiple languages, English, French and a few others I don&rsquo;t immediately recognize. Simple piece of paper to include with the set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">All of the traditional plant elements are included in this set, by which I mean the most used. You&rsquo;ll see three of the medium sized bush element, four palm fronds, two small pine trees, sixteen of the 1x1 cylinder with three stems and four of the small leaf element in pale green. An overabundance of plants, which have stood up rather well, being sealed in the box for the better part of a year or close to two now.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I just opened it this week after having it sitting around in the box for the longest time as I wasn&rsquo;t too sure on what to do with the parts, but while disassembling certain sets I realized the spare small 1x1 cylinders with three stems were a godsend as those parts are notorious for breaking off the little stems.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The new method of manufacturing these parts doesn&rsquo;t seem to lend itself to degradation of any kind, as far as I can see. And the parts themselves are quite useful to have multiple spares of as noted above since they are all relatively common to find broken over time.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is a very useful one to have managed to get, I&rsquo;m not sure if it has a value considering it&rsquo;s basically just a small sampling of plant based parts. It might have been nice to see a few non-traditional colours from The Lord of the Rings and Elves sets thrown in as well, since those non-traditional colours are in short supply and equally prone to breakages.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">On top of that I&rsquo;m pretty amazed that they didn&rsquo;t include a single stem piece for the LEGO flower element, but I suppose those parts weren&rsquo;t yet being made with the Sugarcane plastics. Overall this is a nice parts pack, but it isn&rsquo;t something I&rsquo;d recommend you killing your wallet over to get a copy of. Not unless you collect sealed sets for some reason and want to have this in your collection of one-off production runs of rarities or something to that effect.</p>

"Studded_Dud","2020-08-02T20:06:10.17Z","No Assembly Required!","<p>Building Experience: This set comes pre-assembled. Every piece is loose.</p>

<p>Parts: This set has 29 pieces, all of which are made from plants. There are 3 pokey bush pieces, 2 tree pieces, 4 bright green leave pieces, 4 palm tree leave pieces, and 16 standard plant pieces.</p>

<p>Playability: There is no playability with this set unless it is combined with a different set.</p>

<p>Value for Money: This set was originally free so 29 pieces for free is a great value to me.</p>

<p>Overall: Overall this set is a great step in the plant based pieces and it being free makes it even better. It also has no assembly required!</p>
