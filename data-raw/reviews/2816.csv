"A_Brickset_user","2003-11-16T13:09:27Z","Fabulous looking set","I just recently acquired a MISB one of these. They sure don't make Lego sets like these anymore. (Although, 4404 come close). The color scheme is unparallelled; black with red/yellow trim and TRANS BLUE windows. Awesome. My only complaint is that some stickers go on slope bricks, and those surfaces are way too rugged for the sticker to stick.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
