For now I&#39;ll just cover the bonus item.</p>

<p>Featuring a new torso and head with a re-use head piece and some ordinary white legs printed with black markings, this Green Lantern member joins Hal and John as a member of the Green Lantern Corps WITHOUT a Power Ring. This is a real shame because the special has animated a brand new configuration for a LEGO Power Ring using the new part with a bar on one side and a stud on the other that can be held by Minifigures. It&#39;s really silly that they make this accessory in digital form for the animation, but refuse to make the part in transparent green to be used for Green Lantern Minifigures. Perhaps we&#39;ll finally see it next year in another Green Lantern based set.</p>

<p>The print on Jessica is really impressive though, at least for the torso which includes a Green Lantern torso with female traits for MOC fans looking to make customs. Her facial print includes some nice detailing as well with a little green lantern mark over her right eye. It&#39;s also double-sided featuring a happy expression on one side and a determined/angry expression on the other. Her legs are a bit of a shame as the dual molding might have worked better than simple printed legs.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d recommend getting the special edition with the box and minifigure if you want to pick this up, as the only other way to own it will be to buy it on the secondary market at ridiculously marked up prices. So get it now with the special and enjoy watching the new Green Lantern in action as she joins the Justice League to thwart Ocean Master and Atrocitus.</p>
