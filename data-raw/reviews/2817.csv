"bobdobbins","2006-01-30T18:46:45Z","What is the alternate?","I love this set!  I like the truck and trailer but think the alternate is better!  I think the it is one of the coolest looking lego trucks I have ever seen, but I have no idea what it is supposed to be.  Anyone know? I presume something to do with an airport or aviation but I am not that familiar with that kind of stuff.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"badger740671","2009-05-14T05:50:48.42Z","Brilliant","I used to dream about this set as a kid. I was lucky to get it boxed on ebay for cheap. It was not a disappointment and I love the detail. I am looking to get all the Model Team series and this is the pick of the bunch.

I have one critism - and that is that with the steering from behind the cab, it was made difficult by the trailor. 5591 and other sets have the steering on the top.

If you get the chance, get one - a brilliant set",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I always wanted to have another set to have both the vehicles. The wheel in both of them makes this set a playable one. The length is close to 55 cm. It's just lovely. I bought it probably when I was around 12-13 (that's 1993 I guess). I never mixed it with any other sets I have so I still don't have any missing parts. <br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"dben_155","2017-03-23T08:08:14.983Z","No doubt, is the best!","<p>First of all I have to say that Model Team is definitely one of my favorite theme, It is detailed almost like the Creator Expert set, but with more functions (steering wheels for example); this set represent the main set of the theme, with the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/5591-1/Mach-II-Red-Bird-Rig"">5591</a>.</p>

<p>The model A size is more than expected, assembled it is longer than it&#39;s own box! The truck with working steering , trailer and the helicopter give you thousand hours of fun, and with a little of creativity you can easily add power functions.</p>

<p>The B model is also very nice, not yet clear what it is but, also in this configuration looks great.</p>

<p>The only bad things are:</p>

<p>1) some parts of the exhaust systems that falling down continuously (in both model versions)</p>

<p>2) and sadly some part were missing in the box, so I&#39;ve use pieces from other sets (I was just a kid in the &#39;90, so i were not able to call the Lego service for those pieces).</p>

C'est un des modèles de légo qui a le plus de ""gueule"", racé, la cabine au raz du sol, son arrière usine à gaz, la puissance dégagée, l'originalité du modèle, il a une tripe incroyable !&nbsp;<div>En fait, il est rock, viril et fin à la fois, détaillé à souhait, complexe à construire, simple à manier, fantastique à exposer, il attire immancablement l'oeil !</div><div><br></div><div>Pour le modèle 1 de base, le semi, il est très intéressant à constuire, les 3 parties sont d'un genre radicalement différent dans leur structure mais à la fois se rejoignet en bonne cohérence sur le style. Seul bémol, la finition arrière de la remorque, un peu simpliste, plutôt en décalage avec le concert de détails ailleurs.</div><div><br></div><div>Parmi les model team jusque là, c'est mon préféré.</div><div><br></div><div>La partie la plus compliquée demeure le tracteur (1) ou le 6 roues (2) à réaction, l'engin de science fiction. On ne peut pas dire que ce soit optimisé, rien n'a été pensé avec simplicité. Mais au final, c'est très bon pour le possesseur, ça fourmille de plaques, de plates, de 1x1, de roues et de pièces intéressantes en tout genre. Petits leviers de vitesse en supplément !</div><div><br></div><div>Dans une collection, s'il y en a un qu'il ne faut pas vendre, c'est celui-ci.</div>",TRUE,5,4,5,4,5
