"Odeinoichus","2021-01-31T18:10:42.29Z","Third Edition Arrives with Finn","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>LEGO Star Wars Visual Dictionary New Edition:</b> This is the third edition of the LEGO Star Wars Visual Dictionary and includes a brand new Sequel Trilogy character as a bonus Minifigure. As well as updated information on LEGO Star Wars sets. Rather than go into too much detail I&rsquo;ll discuss the basics of what this title has to offer.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Presentation</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The novel looks very much the same as the previous editions, for the most part. This third edition uses the same basic page design for the contents of the novel, the cover however is a black colour showing off many characters and sets in LEGO form. The front cover also includes the 20 Years of LEGO Star Wars logo in the bottom corner. Everything is still here that was here the first time around, including any printed errors.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Finn in Bacta Suit: This Minifigure represents the character as seen at the end of The Force Awakens and when we meet up with him again in The Last Jedi. It&rsquo;s a relatively interesting looking print, with some nice details of the wires and other details. He has no accessories, but also includes some unique facial expressions, a sleeping close-eyed expression and a nervous looking questioning expression.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">If you like the Sequel Trilogy you&rsquo;ll enjoy this version of Finn, as it would never appear in any set. Yes I said would never, not sure if LEGO will continue to make Sequel Trilogy inspired sets now that the sequel trilogy is over.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Contents</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There is a lot of familiar territory here, some sets have had updates and certain imagery has been updated, plus we get more info on The Freemaker Adventures and the Sequel Trilogy and some of the solo films Rogue One and Solo A Star Wars Story. Overall though if you own the first edition of this book a lot of the pages are similar to past editions, even with some of the errors appearing again here as noted above. I&rsquo;d offer an example of this, but it has been quite some time since I read through the book and so have forgotten precisely which printing error was re-printed here. Although if I&rsquo;m not mistaken there are a few sets attributed to films/television series incorrectly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a nice update of the original LEGO Star Wars Visual Dictionary, would I recommend this if you have the other printed versions? Yes, but I would still caution you, this novel as with many others glosses over sets and does not have a complete visual record of every release of LEGO Star Wars sets. Many sets are mentioned or ignored and with the Theme ongoing it will be out-of-date pretty much the moment it is re-printed. Overall a solid enough update, a nice Minifigure is included, but the data is not wholly complete or encompassing of the entire theme. So expect a Fourth Edition for the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the theme. Recommended.</p>
