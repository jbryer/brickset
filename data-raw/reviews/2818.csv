Awsome detail on the truck and trailer.
The build time was fun.
Lots of wheels.
A good set to help you learn how to get great vehicle building ideas.
The only draw back was the jump jet. Possibly could have been more detailed.
Overall great value for money(lots of elements) fun, complex set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
