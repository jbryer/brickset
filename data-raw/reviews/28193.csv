"Harmonious_Building","2018-08-27T14:06:27.537Z","The cat is in the bag","<p>I&#39;ve got three words for you: bendable short legs. Oh my goodness, I was definitely not expecting that at all. Yes, this CMF Hermione Granger has posable legs in spite of her diminutive stature, which is frankly an innovation that I never expected (or even wanted?) in my life, yet here we are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately: unless I am mistaken, this brave new world seems to apply to CMF Wizarding World figures only (as of this writing), because I recently picked up Whomping Willow (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75953-1/Hogwarts-Whomping-Willow"">75953</a>) as well, and the kids in that set have the regular rigid short legs that we&#39;ve known since...Lord of the Rings? (Man that was a long time ago, that&#39;s crazy.) That wouldn&#39;t be a deal breaker in and of itself but here&#39;s an even worse catch: the posable short legs are juuuuust less than half a centimeter taller than the rigid ones, which means that this Hermione can hover awkwardly over her presumably junior counterparts from &quot;regular&quot; sets. Some people might celebrate a subtle variation in minifigure height for the sake of diversity, while others (especially those who haven&#39;t gotten over the introduction of short legs yet) might have further reason to despair. That&#39;s quite beyond the scope of this review, but it&#39;s what I wanted to say.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond that, Hermione doesn&#39;t really have a whole lot else going for her. Her hairpiece is not new, and her face is single-sided. The cat is not new either although it might be a unique printing - I&#39;m not sure - and certainly it looks nothing like the scruffy roly-poly&nbsp;one from the movies. It does, however, make it pretty easy to find if you&#39;re doing any feel-testing for her. Her wand is, of course, the new version and the CMF bag does contain two of them as normal, which is always neat for retrofitting any previous iterations of Wizarding&nbsp;World minifigs that you might have in your collection.</p>

<p>Not the greatest CMF bag, in my opinion, although purists may disagree. I would say that Cho Chang (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71022-7/Cho-Chang"">71022</a>) does a lot better: she&#39;s a more obscure character, she&#39;s got a rarer and cooler animal, and she&#39;s got a skirt element. And also bendy legs!&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a minifigure blind bag so there&#39;s not much of a building experience to be had here but it&#39;s still fun to pull the parts out of the foil bag and put them&nbsp;together.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>This set doesn&#39;t include many parts but a few of note include the cat piece (which doesn&#39;t look anything like Crookshanks by the way), the new wand piece, the medium-sized legs and Hermione&#39;s hair-piece are all very useful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The torso and leg pieces are also beautifully printed. They line-up well and there is printing on the back of the torso too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong></p>

<p>As this is just a single minifigure, there isn&#39;t much playability to be had here without adding extras. The cheap price point makes this easy to do however.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money:</strong></p>

<p>At &pound;2.99 per figure, some people might consider these quite expensive and I would suggest you try and find them a little cheaper but, for what you get, I think the price is okay.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-21T15:02:53.437Z","The Girl who Knew Too Much.","<p><b>Set #71022 Hermione Granger:</b>&nbsp;At first glance you would be forgiven for thinking that Hermion uses the same exact parts as Harry, while it is true that she is wearing her Gryffindor Robes, there are some key differences between male and female robes apparently.</p>

<p>Hermione&#39;s detailing has her robes tied shut, unlike Harry who has them open. A clasp is visible at the neckline and red trim is included on the inner lining, visible here, but not on Harry&#39;s torso. Hermione includes all the same parts, just different detailing. She also features her pet Crookshanks, who has a clutch problem. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the stands or the mould in question, but Croockshanks refuses to remain attached to the stud on the stand flush, he will lift up from his back paws and completely fall off when using the front paws&#39; connection spot.</p>

<p>Hermione includes her signature bushy hairstyle and wand, a single sided smiling face and that sums her up quite nicely. Hermione is a definite must-have for fans of the franchise and this is the cheapest method of acquiring her mid-teenage self. Recommended.</p>

<p>This set comes in a normal CMS bag with normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure parts you get a tan cat (which is her pet in the movies) which is really nice to get. The cats tail stands straight up which looks good. You also get the 2x4 black CMS stand. Overall a decent a piece haul.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigure:</b></p>

<p><b>Hermione Granger:</b></p>

<p>Hermione is a decent figure. She has her long brown hair and single sided head. She has a smirk as her facial expression. She has printing on both sides of her torso. On the front she is in her Gryffindor uniform. She has a jacket connected with a clip. You can see her part of her shirt under her jacket with a Gryffindor color tie. On the back you have a black hood. She also has printing on her legs of her jacket as well. She has a dark tan wand.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall this is one of my least favorite CMS figures. She is a pretty simple figure. She has a single sided which is disappointing (like so many other figures from this wave). The printing and cat are nice to get, but is again pretty simple. I do recommend getting her is you are into collecting CMS waves or are a fan of Harry Potter, if not this isn&#39;t a must and you can go without getting her. Overall I&#39;m giving her a 3-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
