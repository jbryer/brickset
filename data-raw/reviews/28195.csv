<p>Comes in normal CMS bag with normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure parts you get Scabbers and of course the black minifigure stand. Scabbers is a great to get with Ron. Scabbers has pink bald circle on his head. I really like this because it makes this rat distinct from others. Overall a decent accessory for this CMS figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Ron Weasley:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Ron comes with his new orange hair piece. He has a single sided head with a slight grin as a facial expression. He has printing on both sides of his torso. The printing shows his Gryffindor uniform. He has a black jacket with maroon color on the inside of it. Under his jacket he has a white collar shirt and a Gryffindor tie. He has printing of his jacket on his legs. He has a brown wand as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a decent CMS figure. Ron is a really good CMS figure. He goes well with Harry and Hermione as they are all in there Gryffindor uniforms as well. It would have been nice to have him get&nbsp;a double-sided face since this is a CMS figure. Getting Scabbers is great to get with the printing of the bald spot on his head. I recommend this to any fan of Harry Potter or&nbsp;any CMS collector. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-21T15:50:32.76Z","The Boy who Played Chess.","<p><b>Set #71022 Ron Weasley:</b>&nbsp;Our third Golden Trio member is dressed in the same robes as Harry, but has no sweater underneath, instead he has a very loose robe, open to show off his Gryffindor tie and white button-up shirt. He includes his pet Scabbers and a messy looking head of orange/red hair. A single smiling face greets you and he carries his wand.</p>

<p>Overall the three members of the Golden Trio look quite superb in their Hogwarts Robes, the detailing is different amongst all three and so you could mix and match parts if you wanted to make different students for Gryffindor. The only real complaint is Hermione&#39;s torso can not be used on Ron or Harry&#39;s legs. But that, I suppose is a minor complaint for MOC enthusiasts. I&#39;d still Highly Recommend all three of them. Ron is Highly Recommended.</p>
