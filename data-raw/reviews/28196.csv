<p>Comes in normal CMS&nbsp;series bag with normal CMS instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You get a green broom and the golden snitch in this set, along with a dark brown wand. I am a big fan of these new wand molds. The golden snitch is a great piece to get as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Draco is in his qudditch uniform. He has short white legs with no printing. He has light yellow hair and a single sided head. He also has a small soft green cape. Overall a nice CMS figure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Just building a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall Draco is another great figure from this CMS series. Getting the broom and golden snitch are great accessories to get with this figure. The overly figure is good. Nice print detail on the torso. Would have been nice to get a double sided face, but oh well. Another great figure from this Harry Potter CMS Series. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

He includes a unique Golden Snitch element, a green broom to represent his Nimbus. He has a short soft-goods green cape and a single-sided face with scowling expression.</p>

<p>Draco is a unique and impressive variant that probably would not have been included in a set. His detailing is fairly nice, and he includes some rare elements that aren&#39;t easy to find. I&#39;d definitely recommend picking him up, maybe going for spares if you want to use the parts for your other Slytherin team members. Highly Recommended.</p>
