What I love so much about the original&nbsp;is that the skirt design is printed on the legs. I know a lot of people probably prefer the cloth skirt, but I am not a fan of the cloth skirts because they do not lay flat and there is an opening. I do, however, LOVE the accessories with this minifigure, so much so that I bought another set of them to go with the original. The reason I did buy this minifigure&nbsp;is because she has the shorter legs that the new Harry Potter kid figures have, and I want them to be the same height. If it weren&#39;t for that one small detail, I would not have purchased this minifigure. Regardless, this is a good, inexpensive way to get the Luna Lovegood figure.</p>

<p>Comes in normal CMS bag with normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Besides minifigure parts you get 2x3 printed tile of the Quibbler, brown wand and of course your CMS stand. Overall not bad accessories for a CMS figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p>Luna has a double-sided head. She has her normal face with a neutral expression and then another with her special glasses on that she uses to find Harry on the Hogwarts Express. She has long yellow hair that allows the purple bag&nbsp;to fit very nicely between her torso and hair. Her torso has nice printing of her shirt showing the buttons and pockets. She only has printing on the front and not the back of her torso. She has short blue legs with no printing on them. You also get a cloth skirt that she wears, which is another nice piece to get.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall this is another great figure from this CMS wave. The detail and printing on the front of the torso is really good. The accessories you get from the Quibbler to brown wand to the purple satchel to the cloth skirt is really good. The face with her special glasses was a very nice facial expression to get in the set. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

Luna is dressed in her outfit from Goblet of Fire when she was on the train and helped Harry out after he was paralysed. She has a nice sporting pink top and a small cloth-skirt piece printed with hearts and animal shapes. Her legs are plain blue.</p>

<p>She features two facial expressions, one ordinary smile with visible eyes, the other slightly neutral with specter specs on. Carrying her wand a printed tile with The Quibbler printed on the front, as well as a lovely shoulder bag in purple, Luna is an excellent Minifigure to own and definitely serviceable for parts so purchasing multiples is always a great idea. Highly Recommended.</p>
