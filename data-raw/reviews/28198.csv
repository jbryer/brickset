Never realized or missed it before but now you can also make your stop motion movies with walking Hobbits, dwarfs and Lego children. Beside this novelty a nice mini figure in a new serie worth collecting.</p>

<p><strong>Building 1 brick : </strong>simply assembling a mini figure.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks : </strong>Of course the 5 points for the legs but it is overall a well equipped figure with 2 magic sticks(wand?) some kind of cabbage in a jar and a face with 2 sides. I just re-checked the figures from the new Wizarding World sets and they still have the old short legs.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 4 bricks :</strong> not much for the single figure but combined with Harry Potter sets it&#39;s a gain.</p>

<p><strong>Value 3 bricks :</strong> It&#39;s starting to get a lot of money for just a mini figure with accessories, now already &euro; 4,50 !!</p>

<p>This set comes in a normal CMS bag with normal CMS instruction.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure parts you get a dark orange pot, a green three leaf plant stem, a mandrake, a dark brown wand, and of course you get the 2x4 black CMS stand. The mandrake is a really great&nbsp;part to get. The printing of the face on it is really good and makes it such a great piece to get.&nbsp;Overall some really good parts for a CMS figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Neville Longbottom:</strong></p>

<p>Getting a young version of Neville is really nice to get. The mandrake in the pot really works and complement this figure really well. He has a nice and unique hair piece. He has dark brown hair with tan ear coverings. He has a double-sided head (Finally!! One of the rare few in this CMS series with a double-sided head). On the front you have a neutral expression showing his two front teeth. It is borderline between neutral and slightly confused. On the other side his eyes are closed as he listens to the mandrake high pitch sound (great use of the double-sided head). He has printing on both sides of his torso. On the front he has a tan jacket with a collar and a pocket on the left side of the jacket. At the very top you have his white button up shirt with the top of his Gryffindor color tie. He has black small bendy legs and is armed with his dark brown wand.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice and well-rounded CMS figure. While he wasn&#39;t a figure I was specifically looking for, I was very glad I got him. He is definitely one of the better figures out of this CMS wave (while not highly sought after). The parts are great with cool new mandrake piece with the pot and three leaf stem.&nbsp;The cool hair piece is great and works extremely well with Neville. I was so happy he got a double-sided head as most in this CMS wave don&#39;t have one. The printing on the body is pretty simple but works well. I highly recommend this CMS figure to any CMS or Harry Potter fan/collector. It will also make a nice addition if you aren&#39;t into either of them as well. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-21T20:08:30.047Z","A Decent First Try.","<p><b>Set #71022 Neville Longbottom:</b>&nbsp;This wonderfully delightful version of Neville is set somewhere around third or fourth year judging by the use of medium-sized legs, he has no printing on his plain black legs, but some nice printing on his torso for the herbology protective outfit in a nice tan colour. You can see his tie poking out around the neckline.</p>

<p>Included with Neville is a pot (first seen with The Leprechaun), his wand and a young Mandrake created with a new tuber shaped element that might be designed closely with a squash or potato and a stem sticking out with an ugly Mandrake face printed on it. He also includes a combination ear muff, hair element which will block the dangerous cries of the Mandrake when changing pots.</p>

<p>Overall this is an excellent attempt at capturing the look of Neville, it isn&#39;t his famous scene look, but it does work and the buck-teeth on his facial expression really make him stand out as unique amongst his fellow students. The unconscious expression on the back is just another level of play for the character. Recommended.</p>

"Studded_Dud","2020-09-01T19:11:11.723Z","Picture Perfect","<p>Parts: There are five parts to this set that aren&#39;t the minifigure. First of which is the basic black minifigure stand. Second is a dark brown wand which looks great and resembles the on screen appearance. Third is the dark orange pot. It has two little bumps on the side near the top that allow for a handle piece to be added but one is not included here. The fourth piece is the Mandrake. Its printed face has exceptional detail and looks as if it is screaming. This is my favourite version of Mandrake that have been made. The final piece is the plant piece. It works great on top of the Mandrake and allows Neville to hold it with ease.</p>

<p>Minifigure: Neville appears in many different outfits throughout&nbsp;the Harry Potter series but this one is one of the more memorable ones. His coat looks just like it did in the movie and it also shows his Gryffindor tie sticking out of the top. His feet are the new medium height feet which allow a minifigure to be smaller than average but still be able to move. His head is double-sided showing the concerned look that Neville usually has and a fainted face for when he faints. He has a duel module hair piece including earmuffs on his shaggy hair. It looks just as it does in the movie.</p>

<p>Playability: Neville can move like a normal minifigure thanks to the medium feet. The Mandrake can be pulled in and out of the pot easily but it is loose in the pot which makes it fall out easily. Other than the fact that the Mandrake is loose, Neville and the Mandrake are ready for play!</p>

<p>Value for Money: Having 9 pieces and an extra wand Neville is well worth his original value of $3.99, 3.99&euro;.</p>

<p>Overall: Neville is one of the best in the first Harry Potter minifigure series. He has everything that would be expected for this outfit and would look great in a Hogwarts Greenhouse MOC!</p>
