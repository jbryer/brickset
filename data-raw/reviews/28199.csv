<p>Comes in normal CMS bag with normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Besides minifigure parts you get a dark tan (almost peanut butter) color owl with a tan belly with dark tan spots. The owl is really great to get. You also get the CMS 2x4 black stand. Overall decent piece haul for a CMS figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Cho Chang:</b></p>

<p>Cho Chang is a nice figure to get. She has a black rubber hair piece (which is a little difficult to remove at times). She has a single sided head with a smile on it. She has printing on both sides of her torso. On the front you have the collar of her shirt with a tie in the colors of Ravenclaw (which is the house she is from). On the back you have a few markings showing the shirt but not much. She has a grey cloth piece for a skirt and black legs. She has a brown wand.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice figure from the Harry Potter wave. The new hair piece and cloth&nbsp;skirt are nice pieces to get. The owl is great and the colors work really well an is nice&nbsp;to get. I really like the Ravenclaw uniform and am really happy to get that printing on it. I do wish she had a double-sided head. Since it is a CMS figure it would have nice to have got it, but like so many in this series we have not. Overall I highly recommend this to any Harry Potter or CMS fan/collector. This figure will make a nice addition to anyones Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

It seems too soft for my liking, but the detailing matches up quite nicely with her classmates as far as print and accessories goes.</p>

<p>Cho features a printed sweater with a Ravenclaw tie visible at the neckline, she has a soft-goods cloth element which is easily misplaced/lost as one of the two Cho I got actually didn&#39;t come with the part (or I forgot it inside the foil pack when I tossed it.), she also has a mail owl in a lightish tan/brown and her wand.</p>

<p>Overall Cho is another solid offering, many of the Harry Potter series are and this is why I consistently rate them 4 out of 5, but nothing has truly captivated me yet. While I appreciate all the detailing and the accessories you have to truly wow me to hit that coveted 5 out of 5 rating. Still, Highly Recommended.</p>
