This is his first version, including the matoran first body that can launch disks, and little feet. The scheme is great, with different colors. His job as matoran over, the ta-koro village gone, and they travel to metru nui, and more later he became a toa.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-04-07T22:29:21.92Z","Matoran Jala!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. LEGO did away with the Slizers and the Robo Riders at the end of 2000. This was due to this awesome series, Bionicle starting in 2001. There is quite an extensive story to Bionicle so if you are interested most of it can be found at www.bioniclestory.com

Where these guys fit into the story is, On the island of Mata Nui all was well. There were six tribes who lived in six different areas on the island, each filled with small villagers called Matoran, led by a Turaga elder. Matoran villagers of Mata Nui live and work in six villages around the island. This little guy is a promotional version of a Matoran. He is called Jala referring to one of the main characters from the first movie: The Mask of Light. He was later released in stores as Jaller in set 8594.

This one was only released promotionally at McDonald's with a Happy Meal so you can't expect too much from him. He is a whole eight pieces including disk and is much smaller than the Turaga. His colour Scheme is Yellow and Red, like the movie and has the same mask as Toa Tahu, but in yellow, making it rare. The mask is the Kanohi Hau, The Mask of Shielding.

His weapon is throwing disk, similar to that of the Slizers. The throwing arm is alot shorter though and is very flexible. I have had mine for over five years and it is still in perfect condition. The disk can be thrown over five meters reasonably accurately, once you get the hang of it, making them quite fun to play with.

Overall for a promotional item these are quite good with reasonable aesthetics and good playability. They add another dimension to the Bionicle World and shouldn't be pushed aside due to there size. I feel this model is a 5/10 and is much deserving of a place in anyone's bionicle collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"krysto2002","2008-07-24T07:11:29.03Z","McDonalds finally makes something worthwhile","So McDonalds has created a decent Happy Meal (just around the time I ate them!) and with it, a free LEGO set. Though this does not have the bricks that the previous LEGO/McDonalds kits had, it does however have Bionicle masks. The torso is really cool and can serve many creative purposes. The head is really blocky, but has been used often since its creation. The throwing arm, though bsed on throwbots technology, is not as good as the powerful throwbot arms, or the Vahki pincers to come.

Again, one of the better Matoran in the set, since it has a new mask in a color that is uncommon amongst Bionicle masks. The disk and mask are the same so this one is sort of better.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I like the disc launcher and the mask. I used to enjoy combining this model with the others I had. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"wadaltmon","2008-12-13T19:56:57.42Z","A Personal Favorite","I asked for this set on my birthday one year, and waited and waited for it to come. Finally, I looked on my porch and saw a small box. It was here! I ran to it, barely containing myself. I took up a knife and cut open the box, yelping, &quot;Jala! Jala!&quot; As the box opened, I took out the small bag. At first, I thought it was a waste of money. 7 small pieces plus a disk wasn't going to make a very good addition to my collection. I disappointedly  opened the bag and started to build. Once the model was finished, I put the disk in its hand. I pulled back and shot. It shot farther than any of the disk launchers of the Toa Metru (2004)! I had hours and hours of fun, shotting and knocking down minifigs until I fell asleep.

I would really love if you got this set. Here are the pros and cons:
 Pros:
 -Shoots disk
 -Can hold disk on back
 -Has Knohi Hau yellow
Cons:
 -Mask doesn't stay on well
 - Arms stay bent after shot, but go back to original form after a while
Overall, this set is one word: AWESOME!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Pros-
Good colour combos
Bendy arm
Disc thing

"Matroxide","2012-06-16T16:24:31.59Z","Captain Of the Gaurd Released by McDonalds","Jaller lived on the island of Metru Nui as a&nbsp;mask crafter and was Vakama's friend, but when Makuta (desguised as Turaga Dume) forced all Matoran in storage spheres Jaller and everyone with him lost there memory of there old home. Soon he became the captain of the Ta-Koro gaurd after arriving on the island of&nbsp;Mata Nui. Jaller is a responsible, do-it-right-the-first-time kind of guy,&nbsp;who was fit to be a leader. His courage and strenth were notable and his love for the island, his duty, and his&nbsp;freinds were unmatched. Jaller&nbsp;also had a long-lasting relationship with Hahli, a Ga-Matoran. As for the set, Jaller came with his signature yellow Hau, that&nbsp;was once Toa/Turaga Lhikan's, but given to him as his own&nbsp;mask was broken. He also fetured a Kanohi Hau ""bamboo"" disk and a red throwing arm. he is fun by himself but can be combined with Hewkii and Onepu to make a smaller, Matoran version of Akamai. Jaller can also be combined with the other five Matoran to make a Matoran Nui! his parts are rare, his build is simple, and his playability is limitless!",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2014-01-03T02:49:53.187Z","Good for a McDonald's premium; served a better purpose than the later figurines","<p>By 2001, it was clear that LEGO&#39;s Technic-based color-coded heroes theme RoboRiders was a one-year wonder just like its predecessor Throwbots, and needed to be replaced. This time, they invested time and effort into creating a mythology and detailed backstory, and a specific myth arc. They also came up with a collect-em-all gimmick tied into the story and designed sets beyond the core heroes (dubbed Toa), such as their wise advisors (known as Turaga) and the fearsome possessed beasts (called Rahi) with which they tangled (drawing on the CyberSlam theme for design inspiration for this last group). The name Bionicle was chosen, the first waves shipped, and sure enough the third time was the charm.<br />
<br />
There was also another, humbler line of designs in this new theme. These were some of the citizens the Toa protected, the Matoran - or Tohunga as they were called before (reasonably justified) complaints from the Maori caused some names to be changed. Six Matoran were produced, and released as McDonald&#39;s Happy Meal premiums.<br />
<br />
Jala (renamed Jaller after the complaint was filed) was one such Matoran. His body pieces use toolings made specifically for the McDonald&#39;s Matoran (some of which were later re-used for the larger, post-Bohrok rebuilt Matoran). His body pieces are cast in red.<br />
* A dark gray mechanical head with lots of sculpted greebling, a mouth socket into which a stud can be connected or a Technic axle run, a Technic axle socket on the bottom, a Technic pin socket protruding from the back at the bottom, and a clip on the back for holding the included disk.<br />
* A robotic torso with a Technic pin on the top, two Technic pins on the level just below the top, a Technic pin socket in the chest, and three Technic pin sockets on the bottom<br />
* Two identical feet with Technic pins on top and vertical Technic pin sockets in the toes.<br />
* An arm made up of linked ridges ending in a clawlike hand that is sculpted to look open but in fact is not, designed and made of such material that it will spring forward into its normal shape if pulled back<br />
* An arm very similar to this arm, except it ends in a three-fingered right hand which has a ridge on the &quot;thumb&quot; for gripping a disc.<br />
<br />
His mask is not unique in tooling, but it does come in a color exclusive to this set (and was later given an interesting backstory). He wears a yellow Kanohi Hau, the same sort of mask worn by Toa Tahu, who protects the region and village he inhabits. His feet are cast in yellow to match his mask. The red-and-yellow color combo is solid, and goes with the fire theme.<br />
<br />
He is armed with a black disk (the tooling for which was originally carved for the Throwbots/Slizers theme), decorated by a sticker showing the Kanohi Hau and labeled with that mask&#39;s back-code (which could be entered to unlock a video on the mini-CDs packed in with the Toa). The throwing arm is capable of throwing the disk a fair bit, best results given by pulling it just short of all the way back. Twelve-headed-for-thirteen years later, all my McDonald&#39;s Matoran arms still spring forward just fine, which is a remarkable achievement for any such toy component (Happy Meal or retail). <strong>However</strong>, while the plastic may retain its springiness without issue, it <em>is</em> unfortunately susceptible to cracking near the pin socket that joins the arm to the body. So watch out for that. One last note: As previously mentioned, the disk can store on his back via a clip on the back of his head.<br />
<br />
The parts are all nicely made, with potential abound for making your own creations thanks to the use of Technic pins and sockets. These also allow three McDonald&#39;s Matoran to combine into a Matoran Kaita, or all six of them to combine into a Matoran Nui.<br />
<br />
As far as value for money goes, well... THIS IS THE PREMIUM FROM A HAPPY MEAL! He was a bonus to your burger-or-chicken-McNuggets/fries/drink/bag-or-box-with-activites combo! You got a meal and a toy for less than $5! The size is good for a LEGO premium, and unlike the later Bionicle McDonald&#39;s premiums (which were figurines of Toa or baddies) Jala and his fellow McToran (as the fans have dubbed these) serve the useful purpose of helping to populate the setting. Due to the interchangeable nature of the parts, and the availability of mask packs that included a random-colored lesser mask as a bonus, mix-and-matching to expand the population beyond these specific characters was easy and fairly cheap. As far as the secondary market goes, eBay can fluctuate between reasonable and price-gouged seemingly at random, but places like BrickLink and the BZPower marketplace are a bit more consistently reasonable.<br />
Yard sales and thrift stores are about the only places to find him for such a deal as he originally could be got, but on the other hand the inventory of such places is by nature an even bigger cr*pshoot than eBay.<br />
<br />
Is Jala, or Jaller as he was renamed, in his McToran form worth getting? Yes, if the price is right. This form is part of the story, the toy is fun to play with, the Rampaging Rahi/Bohrok Invasion era needs its villagers, and it&#39;s always kind of neat to see the beginnings of one who would become such a mighty Toa later down the line. He lacks a true Technic gimmick like his rebuilt form available in the &quot;Jaller and Gukko Bird&quot; set has, but he&#39;s great for a McDonald&#39;s premium. And again, the modular nature is good for mix-and-matching to get a varied populace as well as for making MOCs.</p>
