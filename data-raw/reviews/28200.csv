<p>The bag and manual is like every other collectable minifgure bag and manual.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Dean comes with a Gryffindor flag to show his Gryffindor pride!&nbsp;which is 2 separate&nbsp;peaces.</p>

<p><strong>Minifgure</strong></p>

<p>The detail on his clothes is on point. On his torso he has a Gryffindor jacket with a scarf that leads onto his pants and the back of the torso! He does not have a double sided face. I think that these new wand molds are amazing, they really do look like wands!</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Just like building a minifigure.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>This is a very good figure from the CMS wave and has very good detail. Overall one of my favorite figures from this wave.</p>

<p>Comes in normal CMS bag and has the normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Besides the normal minifigure parts you get a dark brown wand, a brown stick, and a one sided Gryffindor flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The detail is really good on Dean. The scarf that goes down onto the pants is really cool. Also his body printing is all Gryffindor. His jacket has the Gryffindor logo on it. His head is only one sided.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Just building a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall this is great figure to get. You are getting a Gryffindor student. The flag and printing is really nice. If they were to come out with another wave of the CMS Wizarding World I would like to see student from the other houses like Dean. The detail on him with the Gryffindor logo on his jacket is really nice. Also getting the Gryffindor flag with him is really nice. Overall I&#39;m giving him a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-21T21:07:42.783Z","Another Gryffindor.","<p><b>Set #71022 Dean Thomas:</b>&nbsp;I must admit, until just now I hadn&#39;t really thought about it, but Gryffindor seems to get the lion&#39;s share of the Minifigures in this Series. Of the other four houses Ravenclaw has two new student variants, Slytherin has one and Hufflypuff gets none. For a Series based around Harry Potter it seems like they really missed the boat on making more students to fill out the other houses.</p>

<p>Dean here is dressed for Quidditch spectating, he comes in his Hogwarts robes with a nice long red and yellow scarf added for detailing, he&#39;s carring his wand of course and a flag/pennant with the Gryffindor emblem. He has a cheery smiling expression and has a dark brown hair piece which is I believe unique to him.</p>

<p>Overall Dean is a very nice minifigure, but I do wish they&#39;d tried harder to give us more characters from all four houses, especially as Series 2 is now available, and we still seem to be missing out on a lot of Slytherin, Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff students. Recommended.</p>

"lego_collector_123","2019-06-22T06:12:55.41Z","Another great minifigure ","<p>When the&nbsp;Harry Potter CMF series was released there were lots of minifigures that I&nbsp;wanted and&nbsp;Dean was high among that list. Dean isn&#39;t a major Harry Potter character and he hasn&#39;t appeared in a Lego set until now, so I am glad to get him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dean Thomas: The hair piece chosen for Dean works perfectly, accurately depicting the character. His happy expression suits&nbsp;him well, and his skin tone is perfect. His torso print is well detailed. My favorite part of the minifigure are the medium legs that his scarf flows into;&nbsp;it&#39;s a&nbsp;rare treat to get printing on medium legs.&nbsp;His accessories&nbsp;are a&nbsp;Gryffindor flag showing his enthusiasm for Quidditch, and a wand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting that the stands included in the Harry Potter CMF series&nbsp;have been low quality preventing some of the minifigures from attaching securely. Luckily that is not the case here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Harry Potter CMF series have had some great minifigures and this one is no exception,&nbsp;a&nbsp;great addition to a Harry Potter collection!&nbsp;</p>
