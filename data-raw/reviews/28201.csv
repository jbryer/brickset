<p>Comes in normal CMS bag with normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure parts you get the snake, a white wand and of course the minifigure stand.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Lord Voldemort:</strong></p>

<p>Lord Voldemort is only three-piece minifigure. He has a white head with a neutral expression on it. The detail around his eyes of the pinkish color is really cool. The detail on his head in general is well done. The torso and legs&nbsp;are of his dark green robes. You get the new dress legs for his robes instead of straight up legs. Overall it is a very simple figure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall I wish they would have done a better job with this figure. Just some detail on the arms or the side of the legs would have been fine. It just feels to simple for a CMS figure. Other than it is a good figure. Getting Lord Voldemort is a worth it alone. Getting Nagini (the snake) is very cool as it is an important part of story. Overall this isn&#39;t a bad figure and recommend getting it. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

Minimal printing is visible for the cut of the robe on the front, he has no detailing on his back.</p>

<p>Carrying his wand and looking suitably sinister, our friend Voldemort is highly dangerous. Cunning and ready to attack. A new animal is included to represent Nagini, she is made of a slightly softer type of plastic and feels very light. Her tail features a bar section allowing a Minifigure to grab onto it. although&nbsp;carrying a snake around like that looks decidedly odd. The eyes are very nicely detailed.</p>

<p>Overall a very impressive variant of the Dark Lord and worth acquiring for Nagini alone. Highly Recommended.</p>
