I have the 2002,2010 and this 2018 dobby. This is my favourite. Probably because it looks like the most like dobby out of the other mini figures. The build took about a minute because it is just a minifigure. I felt it through the bag so I knew this was going to be dobby. If you want to know how to feel for dobby, you feel for a&nbsp;&nbsp;rubber head with ears. Make sure that it is not cho chang so feel for the owl and if there is no owl it is dobby. The price was &euro;4.00, but that is the price for all minifigure series. It is a 5/5 and it is a great minifigure.</p>

<p>Comes in normal CMS bag and normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Besides minifigure parts you get a black book with printing on the cover of it. Inside you have a 1x2 tan tile with the printing of a sock on it. I love that they give this as his accessory as it is very iconic in Harry Potter.&nbsp;You also get the black CMS stand. Overall great pieces for a CMS figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Dobby:</strong></p>

<p>Dobby is great figure to get. He comes with his new head mold. The head mold is amazing. His head has two pointy ears and his nose that stand out from the rest of head. The printing on his head (especially around his eyes) is great. You get a couple wrinkles around it. His eyes are big and show some emotion. His torso printing is great and&nbsp;shows&nbsp;his tattered and stained shirt. He has short legs. The printing on them is of his tan pants and of his bare feet. Overall a great CMS figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:</b></p>

<p>Overall this a great CMS figure. The new head mold is great and the detail on it is amazing. The torso printing is great and does a nice job of showing the stains and tattered shirt. His book with the sock in it is such a great accessory to get as it is very iconic. I highly recommend this to any Lego or Lego Harry Potter collector. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If I am not mistaken Dobby has an entirely new head sculpted out of softer material compared to the one used in the previous set he was featured in. There is a lot of nice detailing used here to capture his likeness, with floppy ears, a pointed nose and big expressive eyes. His torso shows the pillowcase he is wearing printed on both sides, his legs use dual-moulding to produce the barefoot look of this House Elf. Another new element included is the black book which showcases Riddle&#39;s Diary complete with hole where Basilisk fang has gone through. (Printed, not an actual hole.) A printed tile is included, once again, for the sock. (One of these LEGO might make a stocking element for holidays that can be used as a regular sock to be held by a minifigure.)</p>

<p>Overall this a pretty solid offering and a great addition to the LEGO Harry Potter universe. Highly Recommended.</p>
