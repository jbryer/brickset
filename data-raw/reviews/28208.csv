"srose_2013","2018-08-12T02:55:35.043Z","Thank you, LEGO!","<p>I desperately wanted a Professor Trelawney minifigure so much that I bought the original minifigure from set 4757: Hogwarts Castle even though it looked nothing like the character described in the books or in the movies.&nbsp;This collectible minifigure from the Wizarding World collection&nbsp;was the one I looked forward to most, and I&#39;m so glad I was able to find one. The detail on this figure is amazing from the colors to the designs, to the necklaces. I LOVE the hair piece, as well as the tea cup and saucer. I am also glad to see that LEGO finally made a new wand design that is not generic (the previous bar) and does not look like something from a fairytale (the previous transparent star wand). The only thing that could&#39;ve been added to give this more detail is a Grim in the tea cup, BUT that would have been extremely difficult since the cup is so tiny. I am happy without it! Really love this minifigure.</p>

"LegoHobbitFan","2018-12-12T19:42:04.737Z","An interesting but not necessary figure.","<p>Professor Trelwaney is one of the figures available in the Wizarding&nbsp;World series of Collectable Minifigures, currently available for $3.99. Read on for my opinion on this figure..</p>

<p>Legs: she comes with one of the new dress pieces which are the same height as a Minifigures legs. It is sand green, with some printing on the front, although the back is plain.</p>

<p>Torso: her torso is also sand green with printing on the front, but like the torso the back is plain.</p>

<p>Head: she only has one expression, with a small smile and large glasses that make her look a bit goofy.</p>

<p>Hair: her hair is an orange-brown color and has lots of detailed texture. She also has a large headband in the front covering some of her&nbsp;hair.</p>

<p>Accessories: she comes with a pair of the new wand pieces on a sprue in dark brown. She also comes with one of the new teacup elements in white, as well as a small plate element whose size is somewhere between 1x1 and 2x2. The plate has a pattern printed on, and an anti-stud underneath to hold it by and a stud on top to attach the teacup to.</p>

<p>Play and display: she has a lot of detail so is Great for display, especially with some of the new Harry potter sets. She does not play a super large role in the books or films however, so is not the best for play, although that does not mean she can not be used.</p>

<p>Conclusion: she is a detailed figure, although due to her small role she is not necessary. She is fairly valuable on the aftermarket however, so could be good for collectors.</p>

<p>I hope you find this review helpful!</p>

She sees it everywhere.","<p><b>Set #71022</b>&nbsp;<strong>Professor Sybill Trelawney:</strong>&nbsp;A teacher from Hogwarts which has not been seen, that&#39;s what Series 1 is all about. Here we have Professor Trelawney using the new sloped element in place of standard legs. There is a lot of detailed printing for her dress from the front, again no back printing on her torso. She also features a very impressive head of hair using a brand new sculpt which looks brilliant.</p>

<p>Also new for this release is the tea cup element, tea cup plate and of course her wand piece. Trelawney looks great all around, and he single-sided facial expression suits her quite nicely with a simple smile. Overall she&#39;s a great looking figure, highly detailed and with many useful parts. Highly Recommended.</p>

<p>This set comes in a normal CMS bag with normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure parts you get a white cup, a small white plate with printing on it. The printing is of a pattern which looks to be a circle of flowers which are a color mix of orange and green. She has a dark brown wand and of course you get the 2x4 black CMS stand.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Professor Sybill Trelawney:</strong></p>

<p>This is a well done CMS figure. This is probably, potentially one of the better CMS figures from this wave. She has a new hair piece with her cloth thing (I don&#39;t know what it is called) over her forehead with her long wave/crazy tan blonde hair. She has a single sided head. She has her big round glass with a slight smile with a few wrinkles around her mouth. She has printing on only the front of her torso. She has a lighter green with light brown/tan mix of weird patterns as her outer shirt. She has 3 buttons along with&nbsp;a white necklace with a variety of odd items on it as well as two brown drawstrings hanging down as well. She has the 2x2 new brick leg piece with printing on it. It has the of the lighter green shirt with three buttons before it&nbsp;stops and you get the dress under it. The dress under it contains a top dark tan line then you a have wider dark green with a unique pattern and at the bottom you have a yellow line. She has both the white cup with the plate and a dark brown wand as accessories.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall this is one of the better CMS figures from this wave. The pieces are great as they are new/unique to get. The white cup with white plate with the printing are great to get and work well with this CMS figure. The hair piece and new brick leg piece are great minifigure parts to get and look and work very well with this minifigure. The head is nice, but I do wish they would have given her a double-sided head (Like most in this series, most do not have a double-sided head which is disappointing). The printing on her torso and legs are fantastic and looks great. I highly recommend getting this CMS figure as it will be a nice addition to anyones Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bag and manual are like every other CMS&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sybill Trelawney comes with a new tea cup that is all one piece. Her hair&nbsp;is all one piece. She comes wih a new brown wand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just like building any other minifigure</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a very good minifigure and the new tea cup piece is very cool. In my opinion this is a huge step up from the old Trelawney.&nbsp; She has a hair piece instead of a hat and a tea cup with her.</p>
