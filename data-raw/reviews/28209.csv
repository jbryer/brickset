<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Professor Filius Flitwick:</strong></p>

<p>He comes with a singled side head. The detail on his face is really good at showing his moustache and glasses. He has a slight smile on his face. He has his classic brown hair. He has a black bow tie and black hard fabric piece that goes around his legs. The detail on his torso showing his black jacket and buttons on his shirt is great. He has short black legs and is armed with a brown wand.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:</b></p>

<p>Overall this is a great CMS. It is very well-rounded with accessories to the bow tie and hard fabric piece. The printing and detail on his face and torso are amazing. They really capture his look from the movies. The black fabric piece is longer than his legs which drags on the ground (I love this because it shows this in the movies). He has a brown wand and silver megaphone which are great accessories for him. I highly recommend this CMS figure to add to your Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Originally depicted as a wizened white-haired older dwarf-like individual, Professor Flitwick got a facelift around the time of Goblet of Fire, perhaps to save on make-up costs. Flitwick in that film was much younger, had an ordinary mop of brown hair and a moustache. Here he&nbsp;is dressed to help with the Yule Ball wearing a dark black outfit, indicated with the print on the front, a lighter grey under vest and an even lighter undershirt. He also features a small soft-goods coattail element and a new hard plastic bow-tie neck bracket style accessory.</p>

<p>Using the megaphone he instructs the class on how to perform the traditional dance, and his want is not far from hand. Overall a very nice variant for Professor Flitwick and unique to the Series 1 CMF Wizarding World offerings. You will not find this in any sets. Highly Recommended.</p>
