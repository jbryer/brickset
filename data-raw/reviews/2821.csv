"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2015-01-21T19:48:08.88Z","An excellent beginning to a new era of Lego housing","<p>Christmas 2014 was good to me when it came to Lego sets. In addition to finally getting 7140, I was gifted my uncle&#39;s old Lego collection, which was comprised of sets bought for him and sets handed down to him - including this one, which had originally belonged to my mother. This is actually the first Lego house set I&#39;ve ever owned, so it&#39;s very welcome.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I own neither, due to the age and fourth-hand nature of the set. But I have seen photos of the box and scans of the instructions. The box is a simple affair bearing the &quot;LEGOLAND&quot; diagonal stripe on the top left corner of its front. The instructions are clear and straightforward, and take the very helpful step of highlighting which studs on the baseplates to place the first bricks. The only flaw is that you do have to just look at the picture of it completely assembled to build the lounge chair</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set has a rather useful selection of parts. Two 16x16 baseplates, two 1x2+1x2 hinge brick assemblies, a 1x4x5 door with a window in the top, a few classic-style 1x2x2 windows, two 1x4x3 windows complete with opening casements and shutters, plenty of blue roof slope bricks and basic red bricks for buildings, plus a few black parts, red slopes, and a red 1x6x2 arch brick. And a faucet for the kitchen sink.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Two are included in the set. One is a woman or girl (In the days before shorty legs, could be either) with pigtails, a blue shirt, and red pants. The other is presumably intended to be a man or boy, and wears a red flat cap, black shirt, and blue pants. Neither has torso printing, but both do have the now-classic Standard Lego Smiley Face. At the time of production, of course, that face and articulated minifigures were hot new stuff. They&#39;re simple, but not bland.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is fairly straightforward and simple, and wouldn&#39;t take an adult very long. It&#39;s solid, making sure to overlap for strength wherever possible. The awnings do end up having STAMP (Stickers Across Multiple Parts), but the end result certainly looks nice. Granted, STAMP doesn&#39;t bother me much personally because I&#39;ve found cutting along the brick seams with a sharp, fine knife solves the problem</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The finished result is a small red house with gardens front and back, a living room with a TV, a kitchen, a lounge chair, an outdoor stove, and a table and chairs in the back yard for eating outside. The red could represent very red brick, or wooden sides painted red (given the roof shape, I&#39;m inclined to think the latter). Some have questioned the blue roof, but I can understand why Lego chose that color: They were already using black for the chimney and the cast iron outdoor stove, and dark gray was not yet part of the Lego color palette, which left blue as the only other color they could pick to represent slate roofing shingles.</p>

<p>The house looks very nice overall, and is very playable. The hinge brick assemblies allow it to be opened up for access to the interior - a new and exciting gimmick at the time and still nice to have today.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A classic set indeed. It adds a nice-looking house to anyone&#39;s Lego town, it comes with two simple but charming mini-figures, and helped set the bar for Lego house designs from 1979 onward. If you can find it for a good price, I recommend picking it up (but don&#39;t give it to small children without swapping the minifig heads for modern ones or else drilling a hole through the top stud of each - Lego made that change for a reason). I&#39;m glad I inherited it.</p>
