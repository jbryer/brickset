<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>A key character in the novel and film versions of <em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em>, though briefly introduced in the preceding novel, Cedric Diggory is a popular Hufflepuff student known for his handsome good looks, his relationship with Cho Chang, as well as for being the star seeker on Hufflepuff&#39;s Quidditch team. He was portrayed in the films by actor Robert Pattinson, who would later become more famous as Edward Cullen in <em>Twilight</em> -- though he has claimed to prefer this role.</p>

<p>During the events of <em>Goblet of Fire</em>, he is fairly chosen as Hogwarts&#39; champion in the Triwizard Tournament, with Harry&#39;s entrance being a result of illegal manipulation. He and Harry nonetheless provide to be allies throughout the challenges -- at the conclusion of the tournament, they both agree to take the cup together, only for Cedric to become victim to Voldemort&#39;s return. His death has been seen by commentators as representing the series&#39; metaphorical loss of innocence, and was frequently referred to in later books.</p>

<p>When LEGO sets were released for <em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em>&#39;s film release, there was some disappointment that Cedric Diggory and Fleur Delacour did not receive minifigures like fellow champions Harry Potter and Viktor Krum, who both received two variations in that year&#39;s sets.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Cedric&#39;s face is a standard flesh tone with a generic but serviceable happy expression -- I can think of little to improve the face, although if there is one character in this theme that could have used a second terrified face it is perhaps this one! He is given a newer hairpiece with a little curl, cast in brown -- within the theme, this is shared in a darker brown with muggle Jacob Kowalski.</p>

<p>His outfit is based on the Hogwarts&#39; champion outfit used in his film appearance, with both Cedric and Harry wearing similar, color-coded variations. Cedric&#39;s torso is molded in Hufflepuff yellow with black detailing and a Hogwarts crested printed on, although his right arm is black and left arm is yellow. It&#39;s an accurate recreation of the uniform, although like many two-sided torsos recreated on a minifigure, the effect is still imperfect.</p>

<p>The minifigure&#39;s legs, however, are surprisingly tricky. LEGO made the decision in the <em>Wizarding World</em> theme to represent Hogwarts students with shortened legs -- while this seems reasonable for first-year students, even the fifth-year characters still have shortened legs, after Cedric&#39;s introduction, and while he is a little older, his girlfriend Cho is roughly the same age and is also represented with medium legs. Cedric is therefore the only student character to use standard minifigure legs - in gray with a yellow stripe on the side. I suspect the extra side printing might be why they&#39;re long - nonetheless, he stands out next to characters like Harry and Cho, looking significantly older.</p>

<p>There are two included accessories -- a dark brown wand on a spindle with an extra, and a much larger Triwizard Tournament cup. The inclusion of the latter comes with some sad irony, as it is touching the cup that leads directly to Cedric&#39;s death, as it turns out to be a &#39;portkey&#39; that transports him and Harry directly to Voldemort!</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>This is already appearing to be one of the less desired minifigures in the collectible minifigure series, with many using the obvious cup to identify it - and it&#39;s hard not to see why. He lacks many useful or unique pieces like other characters released in the theme this year, and his accessory is of limited value as well. He certainly has a key role in the storyline, but not one that lends the best to a minifigure. The leg issue is tricky as well.</p>

<p>Still, LEGO has done a serviceable job translating the character as a minifigure based on what technology we know is available to them, and you can&#39;t fault them too much for an unimpressive design, and it fills a hole in the original <em>Goblet of Fire</em> sets - there is certainly value in this minifigure, especially for a dedicated Potter fan, but hopefully he&#39;s not the only one you receive!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-22T18:44:08.86Z","Tri-Wizard Cup!","<p><b>Set #71022 Cedric Diggory:</b>&nbsp;Our final Student (who is not Harry) is Cedric Diggory dressed as he was for the last task of the Tri-Wizard Tournament. He includes a relatively plain set of dark grey legs (stripes printed on the sides), a printed torso with his uniform in yellow and black with the school crest with his name on the back, a single-sided face with smiling expression, scruffy looking unkempt hair, his wand and a uniquely printed trophy cup which reads Tri Wiz Ard.</p>

<p>The cup is nice, but is considerably screen inaccurate as it is just a simple re-use of the large LEGO trophy element first seen back during the World Racers days. Cedric himself is a nice figure and it is good to see him here, but I feel this was a missed opportunity for a new mould Triwzard Cup element. The LEGO trophy is much too large, almost as tall as a Minifigure itself, definitely not the best, but the print is nice.</p>

<p>Overall I recommend the figure, but do wish we&#39;d seen a more appropriate cup selection. Recommended.</p>

<p>Comes in the normal CMS bag with the normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure parts you get the Tri Wizard Trophy. The trophy is an amazing piece to get. The detail on the top of the trophy really adds to the piece itself. You of course also get black 2x4 stand. Overall decent pieces for a CMS figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cedric Diggory:</strong></p>

<p>Cedric is a pretty simple, yet a satisfying CMS figure (or at least for me). He has a nice brown hair piece and single sided head. I do wish they gave him a double-sided head, I mean it is a CMS figure. Anyway he has a slight smile as his facial expression. He has his Hufflepuff Tri Wizard Tournament Uniform with the half yellow and half black with the Hufflepuff crest on the front with again half black and half yellow on the back with Diggory in red letters with a red star. He has dark grey legs with two yellow strips on both sides of his legs. He is armed with a brown wand.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a middle of the pack figure from the Harry Potter CMS wave. While being a fairly simple CMS figure, I find him to be very satisfying (for me at least). The Tri Wizard trophy is amazing to get and is a great accessory for Cedric. Cedric&#39;s torso is amazing and really captures his uniform from the Goblet of Fire. I do wish they gave him a double-sided head. I think it would have made this figure much better. Overall, I highly recommend this to any Harry Potter fan and to add to your Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
