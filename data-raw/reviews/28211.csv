Where its predecessors were in-house, this new series is based on an external property that has excited many fans from across the world, for it is none other than the ubiquitous Wizarding World franchise.</p>

<p>Clocking in at no less than 22 figures in one series, a record at the time of writing, this new series sees 16 figures from the Harry Potter books and movies joined in the usual 60 piece box by 6 figures based on the Fantastic Beasts book and movies. With a ratio of three copies per batch, Alastor &#39;Mad Eye&#39; Moody is a figure of regular rarity amongst the group, but whether consumers should be happy or disappointed they grabbed him off the shelf..... well, the answer to that you will receive right now.</p>

<h3><strong>Packaging</strong></h3>

<p>71022 Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts Minifigure Series 1, as these are called, come in a dark blueish plastic blind bag, the shape and size of which should be rather familiar to anyone who has bought into previous series; thick to prevent tearing but flexible enough to allow prying fingers to rummage through its contents looking for that one piece by which to identify what figure looms inside, the packaging scores full marks on all it sets out to achieve.</p>

<p>Nine out of the 22 possible figures are lined up on the front of the bag, with a blue fog behind them; it seems as though LEGO and Warner Bros are banking on the popularity of Harry Potter to sell these figs, for only two character from Fantastic Beasts are present. Alastor Moody, who officially goes by 71022-14, is not to be seen. Not wholly surprising, as his omission is reasonable in light of his relative unimportance compared to some of the figs that did make the cut, such as Harry himself, Voldemort, and Dumbledore. From that perspective, he could have, arguably, been included ahead of Cho Chang, Luna Lovegood, and Dobby, but those three have other reasons to be present (gender and house balancing, colour contrast, and non human fig, respectively). Alas, Mr. Moody will have to content himself with joining 13 other figures in anonymity</p>

<h3><strong>Build &amp; Parts</strong></h3>

<p>The building extent of this particular series of figures does not go beyond simply attaching body parts and fabric clothing items, so we can forgive 71022-14 for his rather basic construction. Instructions aren&#39;t needed as anyone in the target audience could reasonably be expected to have this figure kitted out and set on its baseplate within 10 to 15 seconds. In fact, the hardest part of the process is not so much the building as it is prying the wands (two are graciously included) out of their rudimentary plastic mold without bending or stressing them too much.</p>

<p>If we consider the spare wand as a regular part (LEGO does), Alastor is one of but five figures in this series to come with ten pieces (the others being Draco, Luna, Neville, and Newt), which would appear to be good value for money. Additionally, he is the only figure to come with two hairpieces and one of three to have a double-sided head (the others being Luna Lovegood and Percival Graves).</p>

<p>Besides the new wands, which are delightful in their simplicity and use (hold them like a regular accessory, or clip them forward thanks to a lovely molded &#39;doorknob&#39; at their lower end), 71022-14 gets to use a rod piece (as walking stick) and what is officially a maraca. Turning this brown piece, with painted gold handle, upside down makes it look like a drinking container of sorts, which is exactly what LEGO was going for as this is supposed to be a flask of Polyjuice Potion.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigure</strong></h3>

<p>It is apt for us to have ended the previous section of this review on the Polyjuice Potion, for its inclusion betrays the fact that Alastor &#39;Mad Eye&#39; Moody has a secondary face. After all, in book/film 4, the character is revealed to be a transformed Barty Crouch Junior, who&#39;s lip-licking face occupies the back of the head piece, opposite the scarred visage of Moody. For the uninitiated (which I was too, prior to looking this all up just now), Crouch Jr. used the potion to transform his likeness into Moody so as to infiltrate the lives of Harry and his chums, and was seen drinking from it numerous times throughout book and film.</p>

<p>Both of these face prints are delightful; Moody is well-detailed, with eye patch, eyebrows, and appropriate scars, whereas Crouch Jr. has a certain degree of cheekiness seeping out of his print - David Tennant&#39;s likeness and portrayal of the character has been captured incredibly well here, and the odd positioning of the tongue (licking the right part of the upper lip) makes this a rather unique face in the LEGO world. As such, expect this head in particular to fetch a rather hefty aftermarket price.</p>

<p>Moving on to the torso, we find that Moody and Crouch Jr. have more belts on their person than the average Final Fantasy/JRPG protagonist. Despite this comical appearance to the layman, it is a faithful recreation of the costume used in the movies, and makes for easy repurposing into a different character of the owner&#39;s choosing (again, if you like JRPG&#39;s you will have a field day here). The printing on the back is fittingly dull, making the magic of this character seem unmagical; a good thing, for this figure need not be visually screaming at you from every angle you view him at.</p>

<p>The legs are not just double but triple molded! With the upper part light brown, the lower legs are silver and blue, mirroring the prosthetic leg and trouser trunk of the character respectively. I fail to remember this kind of triple mold occurring previously in a CMF series, which makes its inclusion rather commendable.</p>

<p>The dark brown hairpiece, belonging to Crouch Jr, is generic and incredibly common, but the blonde part is a new mold making its debut on 71022-14; it works well for both male and female figures, as evidenced by Moody himself and my transplanting it onto a couple of female figures for comparison (71012-7 Alice looked especially good with it). We can expect this hairpiece to pop up in sets in the very near future, as 75955 Hogwarts Express featured a wanted poster of the character Sirius Black sporting what looks to be the exact same cut as ol&#39; Mad Eye here.</p>

<p>The walking cane is dull and can be cast aside quickly, but the maraca is of more interest; making its debut in series 2 (8684-1 Mariachi) as far back as 2010, it has appeared in but three sets since, with Moody being the fourth set to receive it after its introduction. What&#39;s more is that this is an exclusive variant, with the gold handle setting it apart from the two full brown copies that popped up in 850449 Minifigure Accessory Pack.</p>

<p>Finally, the dark brown wands are the most common colour by far in this CMF series, leaving them with little worth compared to more elusive colours such as white (only available with 71022-9 Voldemort).</p>

<h3><strong>Issues</strong></h3>

<p>Unfortunately, where 71022-14 Alastor &#39;Mad Eye&#39; Moody has a lot going for it, there is much more against it. For one, the ridiculous pricetag of 4 Euros (which I expect to be 4 USD, and 3 or 3.50 GBP). This is, flat-out said, way too much for a minifigure, especially considering the first series retailed for just 3 Euros.</p>

<p>3.50 for a fig I could fully understand if they were of quality make like the minifigures in regular sets, but unfortunately, these CMF series are made in LEGO&#39;s Chinese factories, which can be considered the place where quality goes to die. In fact, where most previous series already had serious issues (mold marks on the hands and head), these are only exacerbated with the last few series, and 71022 only adds to the misery with entirely new problems.</p>

<p>For one, the face prints are not diametrically opposed; that is to say, they do not sit on opposite sides of the head, but rather, are offset. Looking Alastor right in the eyes, one will find Barty&#39;s face closer to the right side of the actual professor than to the left. This would have been a serious issue if the figure came with a shorter hairpiece, but is slightly mitigated by the, admittedly wonderful, longer cut.</p>

<p>One would be mistaken to think the quality issues were over, though; I&#39;ve found my baseplate to not sit fully flush with the figure; rather, the studs seem to be misaligned or of varying size, leading to the figure not being able to fully touch the base when set upon the studs. This is a small but noticeable fault when observing the figure, and thusly horrendous for any collector who wishes to display the figure. What went wrong in China? We may never know, but this is a new low in what was already bad history in regards to meeting the standards set by Danish, Czech, and Mexican factories.</p>

<h3><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></h3>

<p>Where, then, does this leave us? As someone with no great love for JK Rowling&#39;s franchise, there is, surprisingly, a lot to like about 71022-14; a great headpiece, two hairpieces of which one is new and exclusive, two wands, brilliant printing and double molding on the torso and legs, and an exclusive maraca piece brilliantly repurposed to represent something entirely different.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, all of these great elements are completely and irrevocably overshadowed by the quality and pricing issues that plague Moody and Crouch Jr. Although the botched faceprint and baseplate might be localized incidents, it pained me to learn that others (from different continents) experienced the same problems with this figure. Yes, the pricing is endemic to modern LEGO and to be expected, but those four Euros clearly aren&#39;t enough to entice the company to up their standards. Rather, they seem to have slipped, and for that, I must harshly judge this figure in the way of scores; all these wonderful prints and pieces warrant a 5 on their own, but having no less than two faults (on crucial pieces no less!) knocks the score straight down to a 2 for me. Conversely, the value for money rating, which I would have already rated rather badly on its own, gets taken down to a 1.</p>

<p>In the end, the figure is saved by good playability (you get two characters in one) and the fact that it would have been a near 5 star offering outside of its faults. Nonetheless, I am left torn as to whether I should recommend this figure to you, or to suggest against a purchase. Ultimately, it is up to you, dear reader; if you want to take a stand against sloppy printing and molding, you must vote with your wallet by not spending the currency required to purchase 71022-14. On the other hand, the parts, be they faulty or not, are incredible and will likely remain exclusive (although the hairpiece will most certainly be recolored); if you go by this, and the inevitable markup on the aftermarket, I suggest you buy multiples and stash most of them.</p>

<p>Finally, for the completionist, you will want to get two of these bad boys so as to be able to display them simultaneously. Just make sure to buy separate baseplates so you don&#39;t run into the same heinous issues I experienced.</p>

With lavish attention to detail the Minifigure&#39;s print shows off a long flowing coat, some protective armour perhaps underneath and uses the new dual-mould process to create a set of legs with one regular blue boot and one silver magical replacement foot from where it was blown off.</p>

<p>His face is full of scars and wrinkles with his magical all-seeing-eye clearly visible in the leather thong wrapped over his face. His hair piece is new, he has his wand and staff as accessories and that&#39;s it.<br />
<br />
Or is it? Remove the hair, swap out for the brown wig he also includes, give him his flask and turn his head around to reveal... SURPRISE, it&#39;s Barty Crouch Jr. in disguise. With scraggly looking stubble and a visible tongue sticking out, the young Crouch is revealed. Meaning this Minifigure can double for both of them. A very useful feature that and highly ingenious. Perhaps a different set will feature Moody who is not the disguised Crouch Jr., but for now... Highly Recommended.</p>

"George_W_S","2020-04-30T15:30:53.55Z","2 Figures for the price of one","<p>A very welcome update from the 2005 version.</p>

<p>Whilst Mad-Eye Moody is quite an iconic Harry Potter character he hasn&#39;t got many scenes for sets to be based off therefore a perfect inclusion for the minifigure series. Whilst it doesn&#39;t have the peg leg from the old version, it looked more inaccurate than normal legs by a mile.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<p>+ New hair piece is great for a male longer hair style. It suits him so well, maybe it wasn&#39;t 100% necessary to create a new mould for it. I love it all the same</p>

<p>+ THE REVERSIBLE HEAD!! It is perfect. Being able to swap the head around, attach the other hair piece and create a whole new character was ingenious. I don&#39;t think we would ever have seen it in a regular set but now you can recreate the interrogation scene from Goblet of Fire.&nbsp;</p>

<p>+ Whilst again possibly not necessary, the polyjuice potion maraca piece was great part usage and yet again ideal for play and recreations.</p>

<p>+ As with almost every minifigure in this series, printing is fantastic and highly accurate. Different dual moulding on each of the legs just adds a whole ne layer of detail.</p>

<p>+ Including his staff and a wand is just fantastic... again</p>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<p>- In my opinion, the hair piece for Barty Crouch Jr. is not the most accurate they could have used for David Tennant but maybe it was the best they could do</p>

<p>- The price is always a hard point when it comes to the minifigure series, $4 for one minifigure might be too much but for how detailed and packed this figure is it could be a decent deal</p>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>

<p>A very good figure for this series. Lots of playability with the transformation and great pieces to get all around. 8/10</p>
