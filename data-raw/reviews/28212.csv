"Mr__Thrawn","2018-08-11T15:55:54.85Z","Brilliant Figure, if Only for the Cloak","<p>This is one of the figures that looked coolest to me out of the 22. When I picked up most of the figures, this was one of the first I looked for, but I did not find it until the next day. It was definitely worth the wait.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Harry is the star here, and looks brilliant, with pajamas and a new head print, which is nice to get for more expressions. He is accesorized with his cloak and two dark brown wands.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Cloak</h3>

<p>The cloak is brilliant. The iridescent outside looks quite mystical, and the inside is very accurate to the film, and looks excellent.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is head to head&nbsp;with Newt and Luna for best figure in the series.</p>

"LegoHobbitFan","2018-11-29T22:09:34.73Z","A Magical Figure","<p>In my opinion this is one of the best figures in the new wizarding world series of the CMF range. To start off, he has&nbsp;dual-molded mini legs, white with tan feet, resulting in him being bare-footed. His torso is white 28th blue stripes to represent PJs, and is a very versitile piece that I could see being very useful. His head is very similar to the numerous other Harry Potter minifigure, but with a different expression. Sadly, it is not double-sided, which is a common flaw in the Wizarding World CMF series. His hair is the same as on other versions of Harry Potter, and is very detailed. He also comes with a dark brown&nbsp;wand, which comes in a pair&nbsp;of two on a sprue. The wands are very handy, and can be angled in many directions. But undoubtedly the star of the figure is the invisibility cloak which is unique to this figure. On one side, the side intended to be facing outwards, it is a shiny silver that catches light remarkably well, resulting in a rainbow of color. The other side, which is reddish-Brown in color is possibly even better though! It is covered in extremely detailed markings in light blue, which compliments the Brown to an extrordinary degree! However, the figure is fairly hard to find as It has no unique pieces besides the cloak, which cannot be felt. If you can get your hands on it though, you will not be disappointed as this is a truly remarkable figure! I hope you find this review helpful!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-22T21:24:26.14Z","Harry, you're Invisible.","<p><b>Set #71022 Harry Potter:</b>&nbsp;Our second version of Harry is from First Year, with short legs whose feet appear to have been dual-moulded to show his barefoot status. He&#39;s dressed in his PJs and comes with his wand, again, but also a very impressive looking new cloak piece made to represent his Invisibility Cloak.</p>

<p>The invisibility cloak is dual-sided, with one side being a shiny shimmering reflective silver and the other has a visible pattern of celestial bodies and the like, large moons and stars and other things. Possibly planets. He uses the same hair piece as the previous version, but his head is slightly different.</p>

<p>Overall a decent offering from the Series and definitely worth tracking down for the Cloak alone. Highly Recommended.</p>

"vikings","2020-05-27T04:36:17.76Z","Invisible Cloak Harry","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a CMS bag with normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure parts the only part you get is the CMS figure stand. I would have liked the Marauders Map as Harry does use this in the movie with the cloak (It would have been a perfect piece to get with this CMS figure).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Invisible Cloak Harry:</strong></p>

<p>Harry comes with a single sided head. His facial expression is him&nbsp;smiling. The new hair piece is really cool and does a good job allowing his scar to show. His torso has printing of his button up pajamas shirt. The printing is great and does of showing the details of his pajamas. He has short legs with printing on it. The printing shows white pants and his bare feet&nbsp;(which I really like). Harry&#39;s invisible cloak is great. On one side is shiny (or invisible) and the other side is brown with a lot of blue stars, moons, triangles, diamonds, and circles. It looks really good and resembles the one in the movie. Harry is armed with his dark brown wand. Overall a great&nbsp;CMS figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is one of the best CMS figures in this wave. The detail on his torso and invisible cloak are just great and look amazing. I do wish they gave the Marauders Map as he does use it with the cloak in the movie. Other than that the figure is great. I highly recommend getting this figure to add to Lego Harry Potter or Lego Collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harry potter is a franchise that I have little interest in but I am still familiar with but I adore this minifig .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>His hair is the standard 2018 newly moulded piece which is very nice , his head is very generic but exclusive , his cloak is so big so shiny and so detailed it is amazing , his torso is a very useful pyjamas print and his legs have feet printing .</p>

<p>The accessory-</p>

<p>&nbsp;His accessory is just a dark brown wand . His stand is just the plain old CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is one of my favourite Lego minifigures despite not caring about the source material highly recommend it .</p>
