<p>Dumbeldore&nbsp;is one of the Harry Potter characters currently available in the Wizarding&nbsp;World series of Collectable Minifigures for $3.99. Is he worth it? Read on to find&nbsp;out...</p>

<p>Legs: Dumbeldore&nbsp;has one of the new dress pieces, which are the same height as a minifigure&#39;s legs. It is very detailed with some blue robes printed on. Ther is no printing on the back however.</p>

<p>Torso: The torso also has detailed printing that lines up with the legs quite well. However, it is not a super versatile piece. There is no printing on the back.</p>

<p>Head (and beard): His beard fits in between his torso and head. His head has a small beard and some glasses, but is not recognizable as Dumbeldore without the beard element.</p>

<p>Hair: Dumbeldore&#39;s hair hangs down his back, almost covering the entire back of the torso (almost). He also wears a little hat with a gold tassle hanging over the side. I have found this element to be quite useful when building oriental MOCs, such as my Traveling Salesman build (https://www.flickr.com/photos/142810870@N08/44805022575/in/dateposted/).</p>

<p>Accessories: He comes with two accessories: a pair of the new wands in a sandy color, which come together on a sprue, and the pensieve. The pensieve&nbsp;is represented by a silver bowl with blue swirls at the bottom, and it looks great! It also makes a great washing basin in MOCs. It has two points where a minifig can grab it: They can grab the edge, which has the width of a bar, and there is an anti-stud at the bottom.</p>

<p>Play/Diaplay: He is very detailed, so looks great on display, and also has some useful parts for MOCers! He would also be great for play, and would fit well in many of the new Harry Potter sets!</p>

<p>Conclusion: I think this is a great figure, no matter what you want it for! Wether or not you decide to get it is up to you, but if you do plan to, my advice for feeling him out is to look for the dress piece to narrow it down and then the pensieve&nbsp;to confirm.</p>

<p>Hope you find this review helpful! I&#39;ll be back with more reviews soon!</p>

<p>Comes in normal CMS bag and has the normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parts:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Besides the normal minifigure&nbsp;parts you get the dark tan wand and the dish that comes with it.</p>

<p><b>Minifigure:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>With Dumbledore you get five pieces which is more than usual for most minifigures. The hat/hair piece is a really nice piece. I also like the new beard piece that made for him. His is only one sided. His legs are what I believe are a new robe piece, which is really nice. The detail on him is pretty good with the printing of his robes.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Nothing to it, just building a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great Dumbledore. The new hat/hair, beard, and robe pieces are really nice to get. The printing on him is really good as well with the detail on his robes. Also getting the dish piece was a nice addition to it as well. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-23T16:54:43.54Z","Half-Moon Spectacled Wise Sage.","<p><b>Set #71022 Professor Albus Dumbledore:</b>&nbsp;Our variant of Dumbledore in Series 1 is from Book Five or Six I believe, probably Five though, dressed in light blue robes with a brand-new beard and hat/hair sculpt piece Dumbledore looks perfect. He perfectly captures the look of the on-screen version.</p>

<p>The front is printed with his robe design would looks very nice, he includes the Elder wand, of course, and a large silver dish with printed swirls in the bottom to represent the Penseive. This is awkward to hold and should have included an extra piece or two to serve as a stand, but I can&#39;t find too much fault with that. Behind his beard is a printed smiling face with half-moon spectacles and, as with most elderly faced folks, more beard detailing for the print. I suppose this is in case you misplace the beard part which fits around the neck and is tied off in the end.</p>

<p>Overall a very impressive Minifigure and someone many will enjoy collecting. Highly Recommended.</p>

"George_W_S","2020-04-30T13:28:58.16Z","Pyjama Dumbledore","<p>Professor Dumbledore is one of the stand outs of the Lego Harry Potter minifigure series (but honestly there is many stand outs). As it was an exclusive variant at the time of release it was great to get for my Harry Potter collection.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<p>- Exclusive pensive print and beautiful hair-hat combo piece (fantastic dual moulding and love the golden tassel)</p>

<p>- Highly accurate&nbsp;and detailed head, torso and legs</p>

<p>- Dress piece for legs works surprisingly well</p>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<p>-Pensive feels out of place with no stand for it to go on, Fawkes may have been a better inclusion</p>

<h3>Conclusion:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>A great figure for just $4 or &pound;3. Perfect for a Lego Harry Potter collection as he is super detailed and pivotal for Harry Potter. 9/10</p>
