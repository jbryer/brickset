<p>The bag and instructions is the same as all other CMS bags and instructions.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Newt comes with the new Niffler and brief case pieces. Overall the Niffler has great detail and looks amazing, the brief case looks just like a brief case and is a little big.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Newt comes with a tan hair piece. On his torso he has a blue jacket that goes down onto his pants and a orange, brown, and white shirt underneath it as well as pick in his pocket on his shirt.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion</strong></p>

<p>Overall I have no complaints with with Newt Scamander. The Niffler was a nice addition along with the brief case. Two new molds for one character very nice.</p>

<p>Comes in normal CMS bag and has the normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There are some good parts in this set. You get the two piece briefcase (that is new), the orangish colored wand, and the my favorite the Niffler.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The printing on Newt is really good. The layers of clothing is really. You get his dark blue jacket the goes onto his pants with the printing. The best part is that they printed Pick onto him, which is really cool. His face is only single sided.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Just building a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great figure. The pieces you get from the new briefcase and wand to Niffler. The printing on him is great. I loved that they printed Pick on his jacket. Overall I&#39;m giving him a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-23T17:21:30.387Z","Hufflepuff's Have all the Fun.","<p><b>Set #71022 Newt Scamander:</b>&nbsp;When the Wizarding World was revived in 2018 LEGO did it to coincide with the release of Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a new film series set in the Wizarding World. Thus the main cast was included to beef up the number of Collectible Figures in the box, this makes Harry Potter Series 1 the first and only series to feature the highest number of unique figures in a set to date.</p>

<p>Newt is dressed primarily in the outfit he wore predominantly during the film.with a dark blue jacket, a brown suit underneath and brown pants. His legs use dual-moulding and printing to capture the look of his jacket hanging down to cover around his pants. His Bowtruckle is sticking out from behind the right-hand side of his jacket. Included with him is his wand and two new elements just for Newt.</p>

<p>The Niffler is a new animal piece straight from the Wizarding World, it is a small piece which can fit on a single stud. It is very well sculpted and quite cute. The Suitcase is a brand-new version of a considerable improvement in scale and size, it can open on a hinge and is large enough to fit a Minifigure torso inside to simulate the effect of going into the expanding suitcase Newt travels with. To my knowledge this piece is very rare and only available with the Fantastic Beasts Minifigures to date in this colour. A very solid offering and highly collectible. Strongly Recommended.</p>

"LegoHobbitFan","2019-01-10T19:06:37.043Z","Fantastic Minifigures and Where to Find them","<p>Newt Scammander is part of the Wizarding&nbsp;World series of Collectible Minifigures which are available in&nbsp;many places for $4. Is he worth it though?</p>

<p>He comes in a blind bag, so if you want him you&#39;re going to have to feel for him first. I would suggest reading this helpful article on how to feel the different figures:<a href=""https://www.brothers-brick.com/2018/08/01/lego-71022-harry-potter-and-fantastic-beasts-collectible-minifigures-feel-guide-review/"">https://www.brothers-brick.com/2018/08/01/lego-71022-harry-potter-and-fantastic-beasts-collectible-minifigures-feel-guide-review/</a>. He comes with a small checklist of all the different figures in the series.</p>

<p>His legs are dual moulded, dark brown with some dark blue robes hanging down. This printing lines up nicely with the torso with features a waistcoat. You can see&nbsp;Picket peeking out from behind his robes which is a delightful detail. Sadly, it restricts the uses of this piece for other purposes. His face is not double-sided, and features a big grin which I think looks rather cheesy. He also comes with some spiky hair which I have found to be a very useful piece.</p>

<p>He comes with some great accessories! First off, like all Collectible Minifigures he features a 3x4 base, which in this case is just plain black. He also features one of the new wands (for more about them I would suggest reading this fascinating article:<a href=""http://www.newelementary.com/2018/07/lego-harry-potter-new-wand-piece-buy-36752.html"">http://www.newelementary.com/2018/07/lego-harry-potter-new-wand-piece-buy-36752.html</a>),and this is the only place it appears in this nougat color. He also comes with a new suitcase, which, while more oversized than the old ones, can fit more in it (a 1x2 tile fits in with some room to spare). Finally, and best of all, he comes with a niffler, which is the most adorable thing ever! alternatively, you can use him as a mole.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Newt Scammander is a fantastic minifigure I highly reccomend adding him to your collection! I hope you find this review helpful!</p>
