<p>Comes in normal CMS package and has normal instruction manual.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Besides the normal minifigure parts you get a brown wand and a hot dog.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Her figure is is really good. The hat/hair mold piece is really nice. Also the detail on the rest of her body is really nice. The layers of clothing is really nice. Also I think she has a necklace of some kind around her neck as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Just building a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is another great CMS Wizarding World character. The detail on her is really nice. Also the new hat/hair piece was nice. Getting the hotdog was a nice addition. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dual-Moulded legs are used once again to complete the look of a jacket draped down bast the belt line, this time in a light blue-black combination. Her coat is printed to exacting detail, and she features a suitable under jacket and shirt visible as well. She includes a smiling face and a more sombre frowning expression. Her accessories include her wand, a Hot Dog Bun element and a dark maroon sausage for the bun.</p>

<p>Overall a very nice variant of Tina and worth tracking down for fans of the Fantastic Beasts franchise. Recommended.</p>
