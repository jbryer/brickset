"Minifig290","2018-08-17T14:32:39.3Z","Top Of A Great Series","<p>&nbsp;Hello all, today i&rsquo;m looking at one of the twenty two 71022 Harry Potter cmfs&nbsp;from August 2018, he is Jacob&nbsp;Kowalski who is one of the six Fantastic Beast characters in the series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Each of the 22 figures retail for &pound;2.99 or $3.99, Jacob has 9 parts (including Baseplate) giving a Price per part of 33p or 44c. Let&rsquo;s look at him.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Jacob is very detailed like most others in the series, of the 9 parts 4 go into Jacob himself. His hair is a nice Dark Brown coloured&nbsp;hair with lots of depth throughout, his single sided face shows him smiling and his eyes fully open, he has a dark brown moustache printed along with the same coloured eyebrows printed on the face.</p>

<p>He has a simple torso with a Dark bluish gray&nbsp;jacket on top of a sand blue waist coat on top of a white shirt with a dotted red tie on. There&rsquo;s no back print sadly. Jacobs legs are just a simple Dark bluish gray pair of legs with no print.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>He has a total of 3 accessories using 4 parts, One of them is a new suitcase which uses two parts, one of which is the newer book top part on top of a new for 2018 suitcase part which has a handle and two prints of gold for some straps. Also included are two exclusively printed 1x1 round tiles one in a tan with a swirly bakery snack whiles the other is in a dark nougat colour&nbsp;showing what looks like a cinnamon swirl.&nbsp;Both tiles fit in the suitcase opened and closed&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also there&rsquo;s a black unprinted minifigure baseplate which is the 9th part.</p>

<p>______________________________</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>To conclude the review of Jacob Kowalski, i&rsquo;d say his the most detailed fantastic beast figure besides Percival Graves. He has great accessories and a nice torso part and his hair (that&rsquo;s also included with Cedric Diggory&nbsp;in the series in a brown colour) is great.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d say if you don&rsquo;t plan to collect the whole 22 but want 1 or two get this figured as he has&nbsp;great parts throughout for mocs.</p>

<p><strong>Pros-&nbsp;</strong>Great suitcase and bakery treats, Awesome hair part, Useful torso print</p>

<p><strong>Cons-&nbsp;</strong>Would have loved the series to cost &pound;2.49 as they did in 2014-2016. But nothing about the figure is negative.</p>

"vikings","2018-12-27T19:50:59.23Z","Great Figure","<p>I was really happy to get Jacob. I have seen both of the Fantastic Beasts movies and have really enjoyed them. So I have been collecting the characters from this CMS wave from the movies (4/6 so far).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This comes in<b>&nbsp;</b>the normal CMS bags and has the normal CMS instructions sheet for the wave.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The briefcase is the best piece you get from the set. The new two piece mold for them is really good. You also get two printed pastries which is nice as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This is a great figure to get for the character but detail wise it is okay. The suit is really good The detail with the different shirts and the jacket over it all is really nice. I also&nbsp;like the hair piece as well because it isn&#39;t really common (As far as I know).&nbsp;&nbsp;He does have&nbsp;a singled sided head (wouldn&#39;t have minded a double sided head, but oh well). I wouldn&#39;t have minded if they gave him some printing on his pants (Since he is a CMS Figure).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:</strong></p>

<p>Once he was finished I was really happy with him. The briefcase holds both of the pastries (which is accurate to the first movie) and the gold rectangles on each side of the briefcase is nice as well. My only critique on the briefcase is that the minifigures can&#39;t hold at their side, so it has to be held in front of them or at an angle at their side. (But that may just be me).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall besides not having any printing on the pants and the briefcase being a little to big it is a great figure from the CMS wave. The new briefcase is really nice to add to Lego. The pastry pieces are really nice as well. Overall I&#39;m giving him a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-23T18:54:26.317Z","Unluckiest NoMaj in Existence.","<p><b>Set #71022 Jacob Kowalski:</b>&nbsp;This friendly fellow is fairly similar looking to the version found inside the Newt&#39;s Case set, but there are, of course, some key differences. His legs and torso seem to share the same overall look, but the torso in the set is dressed with the protective padding, this is a clean unpadded torso. His hair is a nice dark brown element that isn&#39;t seen too often, and he includes a very happy looking face.</p>

<p>The accessory included with him is the same suitcase as seen with Newt and some printed pastries on 1x1 tiles. Very delicious looking. Overall he&#39;s an excellent looking minifigure and certainly worth picking up. You can&#39;t go wrong with the parts either as they are all quite generic with no special printing for MOC fans. Highly Recommended.</p>
