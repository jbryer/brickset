<p>This set comes in a normal CMS bag with normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure parts you get a strudel (which is a great piece) and of course the 2x4 black CMS stand. The strudel is great and is fairly accurate to the baked version in the movie. You have the powder sugar and a four orange brown swirls on top that adds a lot of detail to this small piece. Overall some good CMS parts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Queenie Goldstein:</strong></p>

<p>This is a very well done and accurate CMS figure. She has a peach color hair piece and single sided head. She has a simile and semi-squinted eyes. She has printing on both sides of her torso. On the front you have her in a dark blue robe (which she wears when Tina brings Newt and Jacob back to their place and have dinner). She has a dark blue belt that is on both the torso and legs. On the back you have a little bit of the belt showing and a V-neck on both sides of the torso. The printing on the legs is fabulous. Half of the legs are of the robe in a wavy line with some silver sparkly dots. Right at the end of the robe you have a grey tan and slightly darker tan before you get to the tan skin. You get printing of black heels. You also get all of this printing on the sides of the legs which is fantastic. She has a black wand as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is one of the better figures from this wave. The printing on her is very accurate and amazing. The hair piece is really good and the color is nice. I do wish they gave her a double-sided head (like most in this CMS wave). If she had a good second face she may have been one of the best in this series. The printing on her torso and on the legs (especially getting on the sides which is rare) are spot on and look great. The strudel is a great piece to get and goes well with this figure. I highly recommend getting this CMS figure if you are a fan of Harry Potter or collect the CMS figures. If you don&#39;t this figure will still make a nice addition to your Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

This variant of Queenie has her dressed in a suitably impressive dark blue number, the printed detailing suffers a bit because of this rendering her dress lines difficult to make out unfortunately. But her neckline and pink slip are easily identifiable and her dual-moulded legs show off some excellent trim as well as printed shoes.</p>

<p>The happy smiling expression and unique hair piece make her stand out quite nicely, she carries a wand of course, and a new piece made just for her, a bit of Strudel which looks quite elegant and very impressive. Overall a very fun looking piece and the figure&#39;s not bad either... or is she? Could she be secretly turning evil? We&#39;ll just have to wait and see. Highly Recommended.</p>
