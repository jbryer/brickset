<p>Credence: The piece chosen to represent Credence&#39;s hair doesn&#39;t appeal to me although it suits the character. I appreciate getting two expressions, a depressed look&nbsp;and a silver eyed one showing his transformation to his Obscurial form, both are accurate. The front of the torso is nicely detailed, but the lack of back printing is inexcusable. His legs are not&nbsp;printed either, which&nbsp;on a CMF minifigure is a rare disappointment. His&nbsp;accessory&nbsp;is a printed tile that says &quot;Witches live among us!&quot;&nbsp;which is a nice touch.</p>

<p>Although the printed tile looks great and his head and hair work well, no leg printing and no printing on the back of his torso makes this a poorly done minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Comes in normal CMS bag with normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parts:</b></p>

<p>Has only two pieces besides the 4 minifigure parts. You get the 1x2 tile as the pamphlet saying Witches live among us! and of course the CMS minifigure stand.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigure:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>Credence Barebone:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Credence comes with a doubled sided head. The first one is a more sad or depressed looking expression. The other is of him beginning his transformation into the&nbsp;Obscurial. His eyes are silver and his mouth is open in a semi-neutral expression. His facial expressions are very good and accurate to the movie. His hair also fits him well. The printing on the front of the torso is also very nice, showing a jacket with a button up shirt and tie. There is no printing on the back of his torso. He also has plain dark grey legs. Overall this is a weak figure (Especially coming from a CMS wave) with very limited printing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall this could have been a better figure by simply adding more printing to the back of the torso and on his legs. The detail on the front of his torso is very good as is his hair and facial expressions. The pamphlet is also a nice accessory to give Credence. This figure was a bit disappointing in the lack of effort given to it but, it is still worth getting as he is an important figure in the Fantastic Beast Movies. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 3-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

This version represents his appearance in the first movie before being discovered. To that end his jacket and shirt match the on-screen costume quite nicely. His printed detailing is fairly accurate. His legs are bare of any details while his face features a normal scowling expression and an eyes glowing magic unleashed expression.</p>

<p>His bowl cut hair piece looks spot on, and he includes a printed tile which says Witches Live Among Us! A very nice little accessory. Overall a decent offering though slightly underwhelming when compared to others in the wave. Still, a very solid character inclusion and the only means of owning a Credence Minifigure at this time. Recommended.</p>
