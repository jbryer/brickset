"Mr__Thrawn","2018-08-03T17:59:10.913Z","A great figure, but way too hard to find","<p>I spent about an hour feeling through minifigure packets to find this one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are two Dark Tan wands, and all of the exquisitely printed minifig parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>This is a good depiction of Graves. His face(s) look good, I like that you can transform him into Grindelwald, and the torso/legs are awesome. But the thing is, there is pretty much nothing special about this guy. He is just another great minifigure like the others in the series. Unfortunately, LEGO has made him very rare, so be prepared&nbsp;to pay upwards of $15 or spend a while feeling bags to find him.</p>

<p>Just the normal Collectable Minifigure&nbsp;Series Bag and normal instructions with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Just the normal minifigure&nbsp;parts. You get the extra hair piece, dark tan wand, and the 3x4 black stand.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I really am really happy with this minifigure. The ability to have the two different characters in one is really nice and that they gave two different hair pieces with him was nice as well. The detail on the body with the suit it really nice. The new wands are amazing. I really like what Lego did with them. My only critique is that the white hair for Grindelwald&nbsp;does not resemble how it is in the movies. Other than that the detail and everything else is great.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Just building a minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Once it was finished you are stuck choosing between having the figure be either Grindelwald&nbsp;(who I usually have him as) or Percival Graves. You have an extra hair piece and wand (which I like in case you loose one).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
My overall opinion is that this is a great minifigure from this wave. The two characters in one is a nice addition and the new wands are much better than the old ones. The only thing I didn&#39;t like was how his hair nowhere near resembled the hair he has in the movies. I would also add I didn&#39;t have a hard time at all finding him in stores searching through the bags. I have heard other people say is hard to find so I may have just been one of the lucky ones.&nbsp;Overall I&#39;m giving him a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-23T20:38:06.07Z","Disguised Murderer.","<p><b>Set #71022 Percival Graves:</b>&nbsp;One per case. That is what LEGO did for this final figure in the Series and it means it was very hard to acquire. If you are interested in owning one of these you will need to go to the secondary market and pay for one, or find a sealed case for yourself to pick through which is harder and harder to come by these days.</p>

<p>Percival features a very impressive looking print, with side-arm detailing for his sleeves and a very nice long jacket visible on the front of the torso and legs. He has a suit under the jacket with a tie clearly visible and further detailing on the back for the jacket. His hair is black with greying shown off via printed bottom of the hair piece. He has an unassuming looking face with thick eyebrows and a smile on one side. Flip the head around, swap out for the included white hair piece and Gellert Grindlewald is revealed in all his sinister glory. The expression on that side matches up with the facial expressions on the Grindlewald Minifigure from 2018.</p>

<p>The secret is easy to discover by his wand, which uses the same colour and style as Dumbledore, meaning this too is the Elder Wand. Overall a very frustrating though pleasant surprise from Series 1 and if you desire to own this version of the character I would recommend tracking one down. Highly Sought-After and Highly Recommended.</p>
