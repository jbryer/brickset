I like the yellow pieces used in this set and the antenna is cool also. I think the alternate models are OK except for the one with wings, but the main model is the best. 5 out of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

When I got this set, I was really young, so I had a hard time building it. I went for the configuration on the box, i.e. the yellow dragster with the Cheetah/Leopard on the spoiler. It was kind of slow with a lot of LEGO bricks on it, but if you customized it with less parts, it would go really fast. I still have a few of the parts that came with it like the 10-30 blocks and the blue cockpit glass. 
 
All in all a very good set.",FALSE,4,4,3,4,3
