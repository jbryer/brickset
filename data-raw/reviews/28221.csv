<p>This set comes in a normal CMS bag with the normal CMS instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Parts:</b></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure parts you get a white owl (or Hedwig), a dark brown wand, and of course the 2x4 CMS stand. Getting (what I am assuming is) Hedwig is really nice to get with Harry as Hedwig is usually around Harry.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigure:</b></p>

<p><b>Harry Potter:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Harry has a different hair piece from the normal newer hair piece you get with younger Harry Potters. He has a black (somewhat messy) hair piece that looks good. Harry has a single sided head (wish he had a double-sided head). On the front you have the scar on his forehead, with his glasses and a slight smile on his face. He has printing on both sides of his torso. On the front you have a Gryffindor jacket with a black exterior with the Gryffindor crest with a maroon interior. Under the jacket he has the normal Gryffindor uniform that is dark grey with a two yellow and maroon strips on the bottom with a white button up shirt under it with a Gryffindor color tie. On the back you have the hood of the jacket with the black outside of&nbsp;it with the maroon inside of showing as well. He also has printing on the medium length legs (that bend which is really nice to get these newer legs). The legs have the jacket continuing on down from the torso. He has a dark brown wand as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall this is the middle to lower end figure from this series. He has pretty basic accessories and nothing extra special about this figure. You can get Harry in so many sets, that unless you are collecting the wave you don&#39;t have to search/get him. Overall this is still a nice figure. The hair works well in portraying an older Harry. The face is pretty simple and normal for Harry (Again I do wish they gave him a double-sided head, but I&#39;m used to not getting doubled-sided heads&nbsp;at this point). The printing on the torso is amazing and looks great. The printing on the legs was basic, but works nicely. Getting Hedwig was nice and works as a great accessory part with Harry. I recommend this set only to Harry Potter and CMS fans/collectors. If you aren&#39;t into Harry Potter or the CMS series then you can pass on this figure as you can get in so many other sets. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

Again.","<p><b>Set #71022 Harry Potter:</b>&nbsp;Collectible Minifigures typically offer up something new, something interesting, or something licensed. This series was the first of its kind and coincided with the great revival of Harry Potter as a theme in 2018.</p>

<p>Harry leads the pack, dressed in his Gryffindor House robes and carrying Hedwig with him, he introduces a brand new mid-leg piece design to make slightly shorter (I.E. Younger) Minifigures. Highly impressive with loads of detailing for the robes and the sweater found underneath, Harry includes a single-sided facial expression, his signature messy black hair and, new for 2018, his Wizard&#39;s Wand.</p>

<p>Overall I was impressed at the variety of parts included in this first Series and it was very impressive to finally see sculpted wand elements. That being said. Highly Recommended.</p>
