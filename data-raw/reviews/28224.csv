<p>A great introductory model for The Lego Movie 2 that&#39;s filled with interesting features and building techniques.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BUILDING EXPERIENCE</strong></p>

<p>The set has a very unique build with the bulk of the model built on its side and exterior panels applied from each direction, helping the build to remain interesting despite (and in some ways, because of) the use of several large parts like castle parapets and hot air balloon segments for structure and shaping.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PARTS</strong></p>

<p>This set has a pretty good part selection including a fair number of parts in the recently reintroduced color Bright Bluish Green (Dark Turquoise on Bricklink, or colloquially &quot;teal&quot;). It also has a lot of interesting white parts, including the first use of the large Nexo Knights wedge brick in that color. Finally, it features a good assortment of new molds used for the Systar System builds in the Lego Movie 2 theme, including the yellow star brick, 3x3 heart plate, and 1x1 heart tile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>The set offers a great play experience due to its great use of interior space. The front cockpit opens and features a niche that can be used to sit Sweet Mayhem snugly and securely even if the ship is rotated upside-down, despite her mini-doll legs not attaching by any conventional means. The wings rotate and angle on click hinges, while the side panels open up to reveal a small prison cell as well as a cargo bay that stores the heart and star bombs, Sweet Mayhem&#39;s laser guns, and a navigational viewscreen. Underneath the ship, a disc shooter is cleverly mounted upside-down with the &quot;trigger&quot; doing double duty as part of the landing gear. And in the back, hidden behind the rear thruster is a compartment that can be used to store and dispense the included sticker roll like a tape dispenser.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>VALUE FOR MONEY</strong></p>

<p>The price per piece for this set is slightly high, thanks in part to the many large parts used in the build and the addition of an unconventional sticker roll. However, it makes the most of its parts for a remarkably solid build with a distinctive look and features a good assortment of characters with Emmet, Lucy, Sweet Mayhem, and the character-adjacent heart and star. So despite the above-average cost I&#39;d still recommend it for fans of the theme.</p>

<p>Although being somewhat intrigued by this ship, the Dutch RRP (roughly 70+ euro&#39;s) seemed&nbsp;simply too much... However, a 25% off sale made me go for it, and I am glad I got this starship. Construction is a surprising but of fun, and there seem to be quite a few special parts used. Although it somewhat lacks size, it definitely does not lack mass. There are a lot of nice details, and a few well hidden/integrated play features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can also see this set being a set you either love or hate, due to the colour scheme. There are only three minifigures, with them being unique or rare in details. You can like this set for its parts... which might actually be its most attractive feature. As a set itself it has to compete with other sets within the Lego Movie 2 wave that IMHO are more attractive. Overall, having built it, I like this set more than I thought I would. So if you come across this set at a discount, it is definitely one to think about picking it up.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build starts out with the construction of the core of the starship, already using some - to me -&nbsp;special bricks. Construction is fairly easy, and frankly I cannot fathom why the recommended age is given as 9+, at least for the ability to build this set. There are a few stickers, which are on a clear backing (so be careful with finger prints!).</p>

<p>There are a few nice construction techniques used to create the shape of the starship as well as the connection points for some of the panels.Much of the attractiveness of this vehicle consists of the IMHO special pieces: the canopy, the 4 teal-with-print quarter circle bricks (opacity is OK, not top), two white pointed bricks, the four balloon pieces and such.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In general, IMHO construction is fun, fairly easy, and &#39;effective&#39;, that is to say no pointless techniques used.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are three minifigures included in this set: Sweet Mayhem, Emmet and Lucy Wyldstyle. Sweet Mayhem is the one unique minifigure in this set, and the uniqueness is in the smile print of her head. Emmet&#39;s face has two prints: a smile and a scream (of fear). Unfortunately, the white print on the legs is not opaque enough, the orange of the pants bleeds through. Lucy Wyldstyle is a very common figure, found in 3 other sets. The print is well done and nicely detailed.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The starship is well done, and looks very good overall. During the build few off-colour bricks have been used, which shows in the nice undisrupted exterior colour scheme. Sweet Mayhem&#39;s cockpit is also nice to look at and well done. The final starship feels solid&nbsp;and (very) heavy. The play features (the disk shooter and the sticker dispenser) are well integrated. The colour scheme is striking but IMHO not overwhelming.</p>

<p>I can imagine many people are put off by the colour scheme, and that is perfectly understandable. Personally, I have to admit that the colour scheme is slowly growing on me, but originally it was one of the reasons why I put this set quite low on my wish list.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>In many ways, this starship could actually serve as a display model, with designing&nbsp;a display stand arguably the biggest problem. Even where some of the interior structure is visible (especially at the front) this does not distract from the overall looks at all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a play set, its brilliant round shape makes it difficult to handle for smaller children. It is heavy, and there are few elements to hold on to. Perhaps that is what the recommended age is based on. The disk shooter is well integrated, though difficult to operate when using the easiest method of operating this vehicle: lifting it up with a hand at the bottom.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall I think this is a better set than I had expected initially. IMHO it is not worth its full RRP (at least in the Netherlands), especially considering its competition (even among the Lego Movie 2 sets). The set itself is actually quite a nice and striking design. If you like the quirky designs and striking colour schemes, I would seriously consider looking for this set on a discount.</p>

"Fabiuz","2021-07-21T17:39:15.7Z","Very good for children.","<p>I do not disagree with previous reviews, those were well crafted and accurate. But it seems to me they missed one point.</p>

<p>I am an avid Lego collector myself. My own sets are displayed, I select and arrange them carefully to please my eyes.</p>

<p>This is not one of them. This is a set to be played and played and played again in the hands of a child. In this respect, it was a huge success for me. I think it&#39;s better not judge it by parts selection or PPP or fancy building techniques. Those parameters could be reserved to another category of sets in my opinion.</p>

<p>I bought this set for my daughter, since she loved both the LEGO movies.</p>

<p>Sure, ppp or rrp are above average. But she doesn&#39;t care about that.</p>

<p>A few interesting building techniques, like the &ldquo;wings&rdquo; hinges, the disk shooter, the balloon parts. Good.</p>

<p>The colour palette is a punch in the eye, but of course the child could not care less.</p>

<p>The age limit is a puzzle. It&#39;s a little bit difficult, but .... oh well. We ignored it and built the ship together.</p>

<p>She plays with the ship and minifigs like there is no tomorrow.&nbsp; I judge playability 5 stars out of 5. Well done Lego!</p>

<p>The mini figs were our selling point. There are not many sets with Sweet Mayhem, Lucy and Emmet together. She absolutely wanted Sweet Mayhem. I wanted Emmet and Lucy. She loves rockets and astronauts. So here we are, watching again the 2nd film and recreating the characters stories on the sofa while I write a not so serious review.</p>

<p>Please consider it a great gift for children, even if not for AFOLs.</p>
