This set also includes two mini-figures&nbsp;and a Duplo monster.</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGURES</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Emmet Brickowski</em>&nbsp;is still wearing his colorful construction outfit, albeit&nbsp;with a new print to show wear and battle-damage. Emmet&#39;s hair is the same, but his head is new for The LEGO Movie 2, showing a smile expression and a terrified expression. He has no accessories.</p>

<p><em>Warrior Lucy, </em>aka. Wildstyle&nbsp;is amazing! She is wearing an outfit that is completely new, but it is still reminiscent of her old sweatshirt outfit with similar light blue and hot pink stripes. (Sorry I don&#39;t know the technical color names.) Lucy has a black torso&nbsp;with the graffiti&nbsp;stripes, arm printing&nbsp;and dual-molded legs with dark brown on the top for her pants, and black on the bottom for her boots. The master-builder wears a dark brown scarf/hood and a black quiver to go with her crossbow. Her hairpiece is the same style as before, but she has red-lensed goggles dual-molded into it. Lucy&#39;s head is new and features a very happy smile, and an extremely angry face. She comes with an awesome stop sign&nbsp;that&nbsp;says &quot;Never Stop&quot; and a crossbow.</p>

<p><strong>Duplo&nbsp;Monster</strong></p>

<p>The lime green and blue Duplo&nbsp;monster is a fun little build with a chomping mouth and a rotating eye. I like how similar&nbsp;the size is compared to&nbsp;actual Duplo&nbsp;bricks. There really isn&#39;t much else to say about it.</p>

<p><strong>Ultrakatty</strong></p>

<p>This is by far my favorite version of Unikitty, featuring 20 joints (not counting clipped parts), three faces and LOTS of spikes.</p>

<p>The head is built to look like a scaled up version of Angry Kitty&#39;s head with added armor. The horn is the same piece with a 1x1 cone under it to make it taller. The 3 faces are&nbsp;made of 2x5 bricks with a Cutesy Kitty face, an Angry Kitty face, and a Super Angry Kitty face.</p>

<p>There isn&#39;t much good or bad to say about the legs or tail except that they all&nbsp;have a great range of movement.</p>

<p>The body Features a mane of spikes, a saddle for Lucy, more armor and many more spikes.</p>

<p><strong>Final Opinion</strong></p>

<p>I love this set!!!! For $30 USD/ $24 at Walmart it is an absolutely amazing set. The figures are great, especially if you don&#39;t plan to buy any other sets. The Duplo&nbsp;Monster is cute and has some fun features. Ultrakatty&nbsp;is everything from adorable to terrifying and I&nbsp;love the faces and the spikes. Overall there&#39;s really nothing bad about this set that I can see.</p>

<p>I hope this was helpful.</p>

<p>Ultrakatty and Warrior Lucy! is a nice little set, a nice build, and a nice companion piece to <strong>Emmet and Lucy&#39;s Escape Buggy (set 70829)</strong>. The minifigures are OK, while Ultrakatty is the star of the set. Personally, I like the vibrant colours and the overall design. Ultrakatty has quite good posability, though the joints can be a little loose. There are some new pieces, and I like the three included expressions for Ultrakatty. The price is also quite good. Overall I think this is an OK set to get. Yes, Ultrakatty in itself is excellent, but I am not sure to what extent this cat would invite children to play.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build itself is quite easy, with a few stickers that have to be applied (and are easy to apply). The age range for building is given as 8+ years old. Many younger kids should be able to complete this build without too much trouble.</p>

<p>For anyone who has built one of the more recent (last 3 years)&nbsp;Ninjago dragons, or even the Erumpent in <strong>Newt&#39;s Case of Magical Creatures (set 75952)</strong> there will be a sense of familiarity in the construction of Ultrakatty, with the build of the body and the legs. There are what seem to be new pieces for the &#39;collar spikes&#39; as well as possibly some recolours. Star pieces in this set are the three 5-wide (!) printed Unikatty faces.</p>

<p>The Lego-built Duplo brick is fun and simple. Thankfully there is a (very) limited use of off-colour pieces, and all of it is covered up well.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are two minifigures included, Emmet and Warrior Lucy.</p>

<p>Emmet&#39;s torso and legs are identical to that of other Emmet;s, but his dual face print is only shared with one other rendition. On one side he is laughing, on the other he is screaming. The face prints are nice, the torso and leg prints are as well, although there is a slight bleeding issue with his ID card, unfortunately.</p>

<p>Warrior Lucy is far from unique. Again, the legs and torso are very common, the face print (also dual sided) is found in three other sets. Here she smiles and seems angry, but with teeth showing. The prints are well done though....</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The Lego built Duplo-brick-monster is nice, simple and looks good. Unikatty is well done, and has a nicely aggressive look for a warrior. I like the way the &#39;helmet&#39; was designed, though it is a little fragile - I have seen sturdier constructions. I generally like the &#39;spiked&#39; look, and I like the colour combinations. The red and orangs-yellow work well, as does the brown for the spikes and what can be construed as leather armour and equipment. I like the &#39;standing saddle&#39; for Lucy, with the reigns well done. Unikatty definitely looks threatening.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This set is mostly a display set, though the primary play feature is having Unikatty running around. It is nicely posable, and I can see many a child running Unikatty over home furniture and present adults... if they like it.</p>

<p>Unikatty&#39;s posability and size does allow it to be a display set. So does the possibility to combine parts of this kat with Emmet and Lucy&#39;s Escape Buggy into a striking display piece.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>In many ways I find this a hard set to evaluate, as it leaves me somewhat conflicted. Overall this is a nice set, though I would not rate it beyond OK. Yes, the design is good, but the minifigures are not something special, and the whole cat does not feel like a &nbsp;30 euro&nbsp; set. As Jangbricks would say, it feels as if the &#39;volume of stuff&#39; does not completely fit the price tag, which is a shame.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-02-06T13:15:57.143Z","The ULTIMATE Kitty! Beware Enemies Systar System.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #70827 Ultrakatty &amp; Warrior Lucy!:</b> Is it my imagination or did The LEGO Movie 2 really love including exclamation marks on the end of most of the set names? Ah well, this particular set is mostly building a larger Unikitty model, so there isn&rsquo;t much involved. That being said it can connect with another set and it does look very impressive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This model package features a load of impressive looking action shots, you have the front of the box with Ultrakatty preparing to pounce and then on the back you get to see a selection of action shots using the alternate facial prints for Ultrakatty to showcase that feature of the set. There is also a nice indicator showing you can combine 70827 with 70829. Overall a very nice package design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual here also includes numbered bag images on the front showing how many should be in each sealed set, this also indicates how much building will be involved and this is a really great idea. I believe it was implemented recently, but can&rsquo;t be sure. The manual shows the steps in each build in the normal easy to follow fashion without any instances of frustration or tricky moments.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set features a lot of elements, Ultrakatty has printed facial bricks and a few other printed elements with flame details, but the rest are ordinary bricks and the mixel joints we&rsquo;ve come to experience since their introduction. A nice printed shield element is also included for Lucy, but we&rsquo;ll get to that momentarily. Overall a decent selection of parts for building, especially if you want a lot of tooth and spike elements for a MOC.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Emmet: This version of Emmet uses all of the same parts as the Thricycle version with exception of the head, this version has an open mouth screaming expression on one side and his typical happy-go-lucky smile on the other. Other than that the worn and torn construction uniform print is completely identical to the previous set. Also he includes no accessories. Not even a Wrench.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Lucy: This version of Lucy can be found in four sets, a hard-to-find Polybag, the Systar Ship and House Rocket sets and this model. Her print is captured very nicely with the rough and tough worn nature of living in a hard brooding world of Apocalypseberg and her facial print includes Smiling and Angry/Determent expressions. This version includes a quiver, crossbow and the only version of this particular version of the character to come with the unique printed STOP sign shield.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Lucy faces off against a Duplo Invader while Ultrakatty gets her torso built together. This is a fairly fun build with limited issues, there are some stickers to be applied, but for the most part you&rsquo;re just putting bricks and plates together to form a large LEGO cat body. Ahem, forgive me, Unicorn Cat body. The Duplo Invader features the exact same build as the previous Thricycle set I reviewed. This one uses different colours.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: This build mostly focuses on and features the four legs for Ultrakatty to stand on, which means a lot of repetitive steps and mirrored building as each leg is a mirror image of the other when it comes to right and left legs. This will be a quick and easy build and once finished Ultrakatty&rsquo;s torso will be able to stand. No stickers here, the flame patterns are printed elements.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: Emmet rushes in to help construct the Head and other additional parts for Ultrakatty so you can have a finished character build. This portion of the build uses the last of the stickers for some armor detailing on her protective shoulder pads and the rest is a quick bit of building with some repetition for the segments in her tail. Overall not a whole lot to say, just all around a fun and enjoyable last step to the finished model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ultrakatty: This massive mountain of feline muscle is Ultrakatty, Unikitty fuelled by ultimate rage which has turned her into a Brick-Built version of The Hulk. She can expand to this massive size and serve as a mount for Lucy and Emmet, they treat her almost like their pet in this movie, which some might find a bit of an issue with, but the models and builds are definitely impressive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Functionally she can combine with another set, the Escape Buggy, and she includes three different 1x4 bricks with facial prints for different expressions. Angry, Happy and REALLY SUPER ANGRY! Overall it&rsquo;s a solid model and I enjoyed building it immensely.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Duplo Invader: This lime green and blue beastie is identical in function to the character in the Thricycle set, the only difference is the colours. Both models have little knobs in the back so you can rotate their eyes, a feature I failed to mention previously. They look great together and the more the merrier I always say, this one compliments the other quite nicely.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set was a great pick-up, I loved building it and I love the functionality of it. I also appreciate the impressive STOP shield Lucy gets to use in this set. The DUPLO Invader character build is also extremely enjoyable and I&rsquo;m pretty impressed at how they managed to turn LEGO into a decent facsimile of DUPLO bricks. It&rsquo;s a lot of clever build ideas and pretty impressive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">If anything I have to complain about this set is the repetitive nature of the Minifigures, the Escape Buggy also includes Lucy and Emmet, they did this so you could buy one or the other and have both main characters, but while the Escape Buggy also features a MetalBeard and Sharkira Minifigure, this set doesn&rsquo;t include any spare unique characters with it. I suppose you could argue Ultrakatty herself is unique, so buying both is a must. I however feel that one or the other will suffice, and while both sets can combine giving you more play options, I would choose this set over the other one. I just appreciate the contents more here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">So in the end I would Highly Recommend this set, and if you can only get one pick this option over the pricier and much more expense Escape Buggy. Unless you just like the look of that vehicle more I suppose. Highly Recommended.</p>
