"Zett","2018-12-30T00:02:58.913Z","Spider Mech vs. Venom","<p>This is a great 2019 Spider-Man set. It has four minifigs, Spider-Man, Spider Gwen/ Ghost Spider, Aunt May, and Venom. The first figure, Spider-Man, is really good, however, I kind of prefer the Ultimate Spider-Man version, because I think he looks more like the comics. Ghost Spider, or more well known as Ghost Spider, is also very well done. This is the first time she has appeared in a Lego set. Even though she looks pretty good, she really needs turquoise printing on her feet, to represent her turquoise shoes. The Aunt May figure is pretty good too. However, I again prefer her earlier figure. It just looks a little better in my opinion. The Venom figure looks absolutely perfect. I think this one is actually better than his previous incarnation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The builds of this set are pretty cool. The rocket board for Ghost Spider is okay, however it looks a little bulky. Also, Ghost Spider can&rsquo;t turn her head sideways with her hood on, which is kind of frustrating. The Spider Mech really was better than I expected. I was not expecting to like it, but it was really good. I really like it. The Venom Mech is amazing, it looks just like a bigger Venom. I love it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is one of the best Spider-Man sets ever. It is really good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Spider Mech Build</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ll start with the smaller build of the spider mech. It is what it is. Have some poseability, standard design, and it&#39;s pretty small compared to the Venom. I think the part count would be better used for, for example, NY Taxi car for Venom to stomp or throw. But I get that this is first of all playset for kids. And for that, Mech fills its purpose. I don&#39;t like the back of the Mech as well, as it is very &quot;raw&quot; looking.</p>

<p><strong>Venom Build</strong></p>

<p>Ok, this figure is <strong>A-Ma-Zing</strong>, very poseable, fantastic design, <strong>very </strong>sturdy. And also, I was surprised how big it is when finished. The build process is pretty standard, a little repetitive for arms and legs, but overall good. It reminds me of the Mixels builds, with all the ball joints, and side studs. Too bad the spider logo is stickers instead of printing, badly applied stickers can destroy the effect. Overall it looks great and it could be a full-fledged collectible figurine.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>There are four of them. Pretty standard Venom and Spidey minifig. Not much to say. But also, very usable Aunt May figure, which could be used in any city scene. And the second reason, apart from Venom build, for buying this set which is Spider Gwen. Really great and exclusive minifig.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Overall, I think this is a good set, with fantastic Venom fig, great Spider Gwen minifig, and not so appealing Spider Mech. But it is a very playable set. Especially for kids, three stud shooters with a web attached, hands which can grab minifigs, selection of minifigs for interesting scenarios. I&#39;ve got this as a gift so I can&#39;t say if the price is good or not ;D</p>

"GriphynHunter","2020-06-28T16:15:06.323Z","A Fine, Playable Set","<h2><b>The Builds</b></h2>

<h3><b>Venom</b></h3>

<p>The main attraction of this set, I find Venom to be a fine build. He is satisfactorily bulky, towering over the accompanying Spider-Mech. The designers put this bulk is put to good use by having a minimum of exposed anti-studs, lots of interesting sub-builds and a fantastic color scheme!</p>

<p>Venom has anti-studs are exposed in two highly visible locations, under the forearms and on the inner sides of Venom&#39;s thighs. Even then, they don&rsquo;t take away from the look of the kit. The exposed surfaces are in black, the arms are usually posed so under-arms will be hidden and the thighs have inverted slope pieces used to help give the legs shape.</p>

<p>I really like the use of the red arch pieces for the back of the mouth. They give this area depth so it really looks like a gaping maw. The head itself looks great when viewed from above or head-on but looks a bit wonky when seen from behind or the side. Venom&#39;s torso build includes side protrusions so the shoulder joints articulate a bit far away from the center of the torso. There is a ballpoint for the joint so you get full articulation but the arms look funny unless they&rsquo;re put in a reaching out or balancing pose. The arms also include ball joints for the elbows and a technic pin for wrist rotation. Outside of the shoulder issue Venom&#39;s arms are well-built and easy to put in a desired position. Venom&rsquo;s legs are only articulated in two spots, at the thighs and ankles. Venoms legs are built with a bend at the &ldquo;knee&rdquo;, so most stable posing has to be in some form of a squat. The leg joints use rachet pieces instead of ball joints. While this reduces the range of motion Venom can use, the ratchets also allow him to stand solidly on his own. Venom&rsquo;s feet connect to the ankles via a free spinning technic axle. This allows the feet to remain as flat as possible without the intervention for the builder. Such a neat solution for a massive and unwieldy figure!</p>

<p>A minor nitpick, but the white of the stickers and eye-print (which is a bit translucent) doesn&#39;t quite match the cream white of the bricks. This shouldn&rsquo;t really matter since the shadows from the finished blends all the white together into a grey color.</p>

<h3><b>Spider-Mech</b></h3>

<p>I actually prefer the Spider-Mech to Big!Venom. While Venom cuts a more impressive figure, the spider-mech is downright more play-able. Both of the Mech&#39;s primary play features (the &quot;Web Claw&quot; and &quot;Web Cannon&quot;) are easy to use and nicely detailed. I also appreciate the use of the straight web slingers as a harness to &ldquo;secure&rdquo; the Spider-Man mini-fig in the cockpit. Due to the lack of bulk the Spider-Mech has functional shoulder, hip and ankle joints. The Mech is thus able to pull off a variety of dynamic and expressive poses with minimal effort. The classic Spider-Man color scheme/pieces chosen allow these joints to blend into the finished build, unlike the joints on Venom.</p>

<p>While the mech doesn&#39;t feel like an after-thought, it does only use 1/5 of the bags in this kit. Therefore, the back of the Mech has no attempt to hide anti-studs. The lack of pieces also leads it to feel small, particularly in comparison to the Venom it&#39;s supposed to square off against. Another consequence of the small piece count is that the &quot;Web Shield&quot; or &quot;Web Blaster&quot; feels extraordinarily small for the ENTIRE set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2><b>Mini-Figures</b></h2>

<h3><b>Spider-Man</b></h3>

<p>A fine figure. The prints on his head and torso are nicely detailed but I don&rsquo;t quite agree with the choice to use metallic blue around the eyes. That feels a bit too much like the MCU spider-man while this set feels like cartoon spider-man. None of the figures in this set have leg printing but only Spider-man gets dual molded legs to compensate (red and blue legs).</p>

<h3><b>Venom</b></h3>

<p>I really like the Venom figure in this set. While he&rsquo;s pretty minimalistic in color, the head print is amazing! He has such a wicked Grin that feels so right for Venom! His torso print also does a good job of capturing his Spider crest.</p>

<h3><b>Ghost-Spider</b></h3>

<p>The Ghost-Spider/Spider-Gwen figure captures her comic book likeness well. They only complaint I have is with the baggy hood piece. The front of the hood obscures too much of her shoulder prints. This happens to be the only area where you can really see her signature turquois and magenta highlights from the front. However, her&hellip; hover-board(?)&hellip;helps bring these colors back. The board is pretty fun to &ldquo;swoosh&rdquo; pretty the Spider-Mech and Venom and is just a neat side build.</p>

<h3><b>Aunt May</b></h3>

<p>I love Aunt May&rsquo;s sweater print! That&rsquo;s about all I have to say about her.</p>

<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>

<p>Spider-Mech vs Venom is pretty good for the price. I think the figures and playability of all three builds just pushes the set into the &ldquo;worth it&rdquo; regio for me.</p>
