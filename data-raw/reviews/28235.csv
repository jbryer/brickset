Well, that was the case for me when I first saw photos of the Lego Store exclusive Knightmare Batman set. I actually hadn&#39;t seen&nbsp;<em>Batman v. Superman&nbsp;</em>until this year, and while the movie didn&#39;t particularly impact me, I thought it was okay and better than some of its worst reviews made it out to be. So, I took the opportunity to bite when I saw this set, since the Knightmare&nbsp;Batman was just such a great looking figure and came from one of the more interesting scenes of the movie.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><em>Batman</em>; I already made it clear that this figure was the main reason for buying this set, so lets get it out of the way first! The trench-coat over the Batsuit is a new printed design, with dual molded legs to represent the high combat boots Batman is wearing combined with olive drab prints for the pants, and more tan molding to represent the trench coat. The common Batman hood gets a new printed goggle decal on it The arms have printing to show straps across the sleeves of the coat. Batman comes with a gun as an accessory, with a Joker card printed on a 1x1 tile and clipped onto the barrel. Yep, if this guy was on sale just as an individual figure I would be willing to pay a solid $10 for him, its just that great of a figure!&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Parademons</em>; now lest I forget, this set comes with two other figures.These Parademons share the same printing, and if my memory is correct they are identical to the green Parademons released in the Justice League wave. They come with two different variants of a thin plastic wing piece; and as I have stated&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/53278"">in a previous review</a>, I really don&#39;t like this type&nbsp;of flimsy thin wings. I really wish it was a proper hard plastic molded piece. With that said, the print detailing on these two figures is excellent, and I am sure they can serve as disposable &#39;mooks&#39; or &#39;minions&#39; for kids playing with their Lego Superheroes. Both figures come with stud shooters.<br />
<br />
<strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>So the bricks come together to form this, small turret. Yah? Its also worth mentioning that all the figures come pre-built, meaning the only assembly required is for their accessory parts. Overall this is a rather lackluster build.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Let me be honest, if this was just some Parademon&#39;s and a more common Batman figure; I really would not have been enticed to buy this set at all. But, the Knightmare&nbsp;Batman is a great figure and really justifies purchasing this set. I recommend this for any Batman and minifigure collectors, who will absolutely enjoy this unique figure. Anyone though looking for an interesting Lego build would be better off buying something else.&nbsp;<br />

And for intent and purpose sake I&nbsp;feel the same about this one.. however I&nbsp;must address a bias I have against this set. I hated Batman Vs Superman, it was a terrible film. And one of the huge issues I&nbsp;had was the particular scene this set is based off of. This iteration of Batman is not Batman.. it is Batfleck.</p>

<p>Minifigures.</p>

<p>The Batman in this set is an accurate and interesting figure based off the awful&nbsp;Batzarro&nbsp;version of Batman featured in the DCEU. Incorporating entirely new prints on the cowl, head, torso and legs this figure alone is almost worth the RRP.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two green&nbsp;Parademons&nbsp;are also included, which are the army builder part of the set. These are the same as seen in previous Justice League sets and provide a nice little bulk up to Darkseid&#39;s ranks.</p>

<p>Build.</p>

<p>Also included is a simple&nbsp;turret build just to add some playability just incase you felt a gun toting homicidal&nbsp;Batfleck&nbsp;didn&#39;t already have things covered.</p>

<p>Accessories&nbsp;</p>

<p>You of course get Batfleck&#39;s infamous&nbsp;rifle. While simple to construct it is nice to get mature looking accessory. Also included is two stud shooters to arm your Parademon&#39;s. The crown of the accessories&nbsp;is a beautiful 1x1 printed tile of the Joker card. Amazing to get such a unique and interesting&nbsp;piece in such a random and bizarre&nbsp;set that has nothing to do with the Joker.&nbsp;An affordable set, that provides an exclusive&nbsp;and well detailed minifigure, two cool army building figures and then some interactive accessories including a currently exclusive and highly collectable piece. Worth it and recommended for the RRP.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-13T21:00:12.487Z","Parademon Army Builder","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #853744 Knightmare Batman Accessory Set:</b> This particular release from last year is an additional set which could be considered as another Batman v. Superman inspired release as it includes three Minifigures with direct links to that film and a small build for added play value. Is it something worth picking up while it&rsquo;s still on shelves at The LEGO Store? I shall endeavor to convince you of that, or at the very least offer an informative opinion on the matter.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This was released on a blister card pack similar to every other in store exclusive release. This style of packaging allows you to find them easily when looking in the store, the images on this card are rather simplistic compared to the Nexo Knights packs I picked up previously, the imagery shows off some artwork that may be located on Apokalypse although it could just be a desolated Earth. It&rsquo;s pretty plain.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Knightmare Batman: This version of Batman from BvS is a very detailed printed character, his torso is dual-sided with the long trench coat covering his armor and his legs are dual-molded so his coat can simulate falling down over his legs. His cowl has goggles printed on the top to simulate the look of the costume from his brief dream sequence. For accessories he has a brick-built gun with a printed Joker 1x1 tile.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Parademon: The two Parademons in this set are green in colour and share identical printed parts, each one has two different sets of wings allowing you to make two distinct characters by choosing one or the other, one is more for flying while the other is an at rest on the ground kind of pose. Each of them also include stud shooters.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Batman gets an adjustable turret with stud shooters attached to it so he can fire on the Parademons. This is a minor build and so there isn&rsquo;t much to say about it. It&rsquo;s a nice little model for Batman to stand with and looks great.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This was an unexpected release from LEGO that came out last year and still lingers around LEGO stores to this day which is a bit of a shame as the Minifigures are very detailed and it does allow you to build a small army of Parademons if you pick more than one up. I&rsquo;d recommend getting at least one for the Batman Minifigure alone since his print and costume is some of the best stuff from the BvS movie. Recommended.</p>
