<p>Comes in the normal polybag&nbsp;bag and has the normal size polybag instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The set doesn&#39;t come with anything that doesn&#39;t come in any other set.&nbsp;I do like the brown pieces as they aren&#39;t to common. The total piece count for the set is 49.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
The build was quick and easy took me under two minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>My overall opinion is that this is a great polybag. It was bigger than I thought it would be. The arms are very long and the ability to rotate them&nbsp;360 degrees was&nbsp;also a nice&nbsp;bonus. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

","<p>I don&#39;t think much of this one.&nbsp; It&#39;s hard to tell even what it is.&nbsp; while&#39;s it suppose to a tank, you mistake it for some type of star fighter.&nbsp; It does have it&#39;s upsides.&nbsp; It&#39;s easy to put together.&nbsp; And if you wanted to take it apart, there are some nice bricks you could use in another project.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
