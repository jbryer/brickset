There are 22 figures to collect who come packaged in a mystery foil bag with one per bag, to collect the whole series would cost &pound;65.78/$87.78.</span></font></p>

These wands can be held on a small ball joint meaning the wand has more moving and fun potential.</span></p>

Carrying on from the first review.</span></p>

<p><b>17. Newt Scamander</b></p>

<p>Firstly for these Fantastic Beast characters is Newt Scamander, who has 9 parts. His light nougat spiky hair sits on his happy cheerful face with some cheekbones and eyebrows visible. His torso has his little plant in his pocket of the jacket that sits on top of his overcoat and shirt. His overcoat continues onto his brown legs.</p>

<p>Newt has three accessories, a set of dark orange wands, a suitcase using the book cover and a new suitcase handle and compartment part together. Finally he has a Niffler that is double molded with black and flesh with his eyes being its only print.</p>

<p>Newt gets a 89% as i love his accessories and hair but the figure is quite boring to me.</p>

<p><strong>18. Tina Goldstein</strong></p>

<p>Here is Tina Goldstein, who is very similar to the LEGO Dimensions Tina Goldstein released in early 2017, She uses the same hat hair combo that has a dark blue cap and dark brown hair. Tina&#39;s double sided face has a small smile and the other has a quite sad or disappointed mouth. Her coat has large buttons and is sand blue with another coat underneath and a white shirt under that. Her coat continues onto her double molded legs (sand blue-dark brown).</p>

<p>Tina has two accessories, a set of light brown wands and a dark brown hotdog in a dark tan hot dog bun.</p>

<p>Tina gets a 89% as she is a update of her 2017 Dimensions figure and i love it, especially her hotdog that is a great inclusion.</p>

<p><strong>19. Jacob Kowalski</strong></p>

<p>Here is the only figure I&#39;ve reviewed already, but I&#39;ll sum him up here. Jacob Kowalski has 8 pieces with his slightly curly dark brown hair on his face that has a mustache and eyebrows with a friendly smile. Jacob has a casual suit that could be used anywhere in a nice dark gray colour with a sand blue overcoat underneath it, with plain unprinted gray trousers.</p>

<p>Unlike most figures in this series, Jacob does not have a wand but has 3 accessories, he has the same suitcase as Newt but he has two 1x1 tiles with one printed as a cinnamon bun and swirl treat.</p>

<p>Jacob get a 100% as I love everything about this figure apart form his face.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s the link to my review of this figure in more detail:&nbsp;https://brickset.com/reviews/53808</p>

<p><b>20. Queenie Goldstein</b></p>

<p>Nearing the end now, but here is Queenie Goldstein who has 7 pieces. Her hair is a awesome light orange curly hair piece on a face that is printed with a slight smile and squinted eyes. Her torso has a dark blue dress with a shiny pink detail. The dark blue skirt continues onto her legs with her shoe being printed with black print.</p>

<p>Queenie has two accessories, a set of black wands and a new unique pastry that has sugar and apricots on top.</p>

<p>Queenie get a 79% as though her accessories are great along with her hair the rest of the figure is meh</p>

<p><strong>21. Credence Bones</strong></p>

<p>We are reaching the last two and sadly i hate both of these next two, firstly there is Credence Bones who has 6 pieces, His hair is what looks to be a bowl cut in black that sits on his double sided face that one side has a normal face with a frown and the other one has what looks to be a possessed face with white eyes and a open mouth. His torso has a stripy overcoat under a jacket and some plain unprinted dark gray legs.</p>

<p>Credence only has ONE accessory and that is not a wand but a 1x2 tile saying &quot;WITCHES LIVE AMONG US!&quot; with a image of witches dancing around a fire</p>

<p>Credence gets a low 50% as i personally think he is just boring and has nothing much to offer, i only really like his 1x2 tile.</p>

<p><strong>22. Percival Graves</strong></p>

<p>We have reached the last one and the rarest being one per box and that is Percival Graves, he has 7 pieces. Percival hair is a black soft hair piece with some gray print on the sides. His face is quite chilled and happy, but if you swap his hair with a white version of his hair and turn his hair around and their you&#39;ve got Grindlewald with his white mustache and eyebrows and gray left eye.</p>

<p>His torso has a large coat that goes onto his legs with a overcoat underneath and underneath that is a white shirt and dark blue tie.</p>

<p>Percival only has a set of brick yellow wands.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Percival gets 69% as though better than Credence he still lacks in anything unique and bags the question why make this figure of all the rare 1 per box character. Though i do like the transformation feature to Grindlewald</p>
