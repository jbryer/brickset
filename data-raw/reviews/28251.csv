<br />
I&#39;d say that I&#39;m still pretty new to collecting LEGO Star Wars - I only started in late 2018 to early 2019, so I missed out on a ton of gems from 2013 to&nbsp;2017.<br />
<br />
I didn&#39;t have an&nbsp;Obi-Wan Kenobi minifigure in my collection, so I thought I&#39;d get this little foil pack for $9 AUD. I don&#39;t regret it - this magazine gift has a minifigure that&#39;s rarer than you think.<br />
<br />
<strong>Packaging</strong><br />
<br />
The traditional foil bag is common packaging nowadays&nbsp;for magazine gifts that come with the Immediate Media LEGO magazine publishings.&nbsp;It has&nbsp;relatively newer square dimensions compared to the older rectangular packaging.<br />
<br />
The art is pretty attractive to me, with a CGI image of Obi-Wan as well as an image of the Obi-Wan minifigure. There is also the 2018 The Last Jedi box rim art - a LEGO logo beside a red Star Wars logo on a white background, with some red patterning that resembles tyre tread patterning on snow, or ski speeders&#39; patterning on Crait&#39;s salty surface.<br />
<br />
There is also a &quot;limited edition&quot; label, which I kind of doubt.<br />
<br />
<strong>Contents and build</strong><br />
<br />
There are six pieces that make up&nbsp;Obi-Wan Kenobi and his blue lightsaber. The build was over as soon as it started, but that is to be expected from a set of this tiny size.<br />
<br />
Foil packs like these are usually gifts that come with LEGO magazines published by Immediate Media, and these packs usually don&#39;t come with instructions - the instructions would be included on pages of the magazine. Since this set is essentially just a minifigure, this is not much of an issue - it is very easy to build, even for the most inexperienced of beginners. (however this may be a bit of an issue for other similar foil packs like Star Wars ships and locations microbuilds)<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigure</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Obi-Wan</strong> is dressed in his attire from Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones, and he is armed with his blue lightsaber that he is rarely seen without. This figure in this configuration has only appeared in one other set - <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75191-1/Jedi-Starfighter-with-Hyperdrive"">75191 Jedi Starfighter with Hyperdrive</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;and is actually considerably rare. The most uncommon piece on this minifigure is probably the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6195236/mini-upper-part-no-3905"">torso piece</a> which only appears in the aforementioned set 75191.<br />
<br />
Obi-Wan has a lovely double-sided <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6141817/mini-head-no-1865"">head piece</a> which only appears in 2 sets. Both expressions are excellent, depicting Obi-Wan slightly frowning on one side and gritting his teeth on the other, both printed with a metallic gold headset. His hairpiece is relatively common, appearing in more than 20 sets and the most notable examples I can think of are crooks from LEGO City and Ronin from LEGO Ninjago.<br />
<br />
<strong>Playability</strong><br />
<br />
The playability that this set offers is extremely limited, but children would have fun swinging Obi-Wan around hitting invisible enemies or ones from their own collection. I would say that this minifigure would best fit in Attack of the Clones LEGO dioramas and MOCs.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall thoughts&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
911839&nbsp;Obi-Wan Kenobi makes a fine&nbsp;addition to any LEGO Star Wars fan&#39;s collection, featuring a rare version of the famed Jedi Knight Obi-Wan Kenobi.&nbsp;</p>
