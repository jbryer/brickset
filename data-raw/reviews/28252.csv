"Minifig290","2018-08-16T14:57:00.737Z","Great Value For Â£4.50","<p>Hello, welcome to my review of the Owen and Lookout Tower gift included in the Issue 2 of the popular Jurassic World magazine retailin at &pound;4.50 released August 8th, the magazine is highly available at any Major supermarket, Newsagents or WHSmiths&nbsp;etc. The set includes a figure and a build overall consisting of 39 parts giving a price per part of 11p. Let&rsquo;s look at it :)</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Owen is a fairly&nbsp;common figure with his great Nougat hair piece and a double sided face print with a stubble beard on each side and one side a smile and the other has a similar print. His torso shows his brown jacket over a light blue shirt with pockets, and his hips have a belt and his legs are rather bland with just a pocket for the&nbsp;belt.</p>

<p><b>Accessories</b></p>

<p>Included in the set is a simple stud shooter in a pearl silver with 6 trans light blue studs to fire off. Oddly my stud shooter and was preassembled. Also there&rsquo;s a light bluish grey&nbsp;pair of binoculars which can be attached to the tower.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The lookout tower uses the remaining parts. It sits on a green 4x6 plate and has a small plant using the 6 stalks flower holder on a new 3 leaves part. The lookout tower is raised by a brick with a step leading up to the tower. The tower&nbsp;has a computer&nbsp;printed black 1x4 slope with a black 1x1 brick with a clip to hold either the stud shooter or the binoculars . There&rsquo;s a hollow space to look out of with just 2 cylinder&nbsp;bricks on each side keeping up the roof which has 2 1x2 plates holding a large sloped part on top of a 1x4 plate.</p>

<p><strong>Magazine</strong></p>

<p>The 34 paged magazine is full of fun from a comic to posters and games</p>

<p>______________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>The toy is a great compliment to a fantastic fun filled magazine. The &pound;4.50 price to me is reasonable.</p>

<p>The build goes great with the previous issue and has a great detailed figure and build.</p>

<p><b>Pros-&nbsp;</b>Great build and figure and detailed magazine.</p>

<p><b>Cons- Last issue of the Jurassic World comics NOOOOOOOOOO</b></p>

"lkb57","2018-10-24T18:27:54.86Z","Fallen Kingdom Owen (for less!)","<p>This is my second review of the foil packs released in Europe with the Lego Jurassic World Magazine. As a Yank, I had to pick this up on the secondary market, but as I&#39;m still saving up for the more expensive Fallen Kingdom sets, this was a cheap(er) way to get the Fallen Kingdom Owen minifigure, which also comes in <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/jw023/owen-grady"">three other sets</a>.</p>

<p><img alt=""2018 Fallen Kingdom Owen"" src=""http://img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/MN/0/jw023.png"" style=""width: 200px; height: 311px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/MN/0/jw011.png"" style=""width: 200px; height: 313px;"" /></p>

<p>Now, I didn&#39;t realize it until after I&#39;d bought this little set, but the Fallen Kingdom Owen minifigure&nbsp;(above top) is a brand new design. And to be honest, I think it&#39;s a much better design than the original Jurassic World Owen (above lower). The colors are brighter and bolder, and somehow the designers have managed to pack a lot more emotion into the 2018 Owen&#39;s face. My only complaint is that the printing on the back of the new Owen doesn&#39;t have the cool sheathed knife that the original minifigure&nbsp;had:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://thumbs.worthpoint.com/zoom/images3/1/0615/16/lego-jurassic-world-chris-pratt-owen_1_997e2f737e8b17bb3d891e764410cf68.jpg"" style=""width: 250px; height: 188px;"" /></p>

<p>Now, the lack of a knife in the Fallen Kingdom minifigure is probably accurate to the sequel, but come on . . . that knife is awesome. The front of Owen&#39;s head features a classic Chris Pratt smirk, while the back has a more serious expression.&nbsp;The legs also feature simple printing of a belt and pouch, very similar (though again, in much better colors) to the original Owen minifigure. And even though I complained about the knife, the printing on the front of the new Owen&#39;s torso is much more detailed and even features some nice shading effects. I swear, every year I think the minifigure&nbsp;printing can&#39;t get any better, and then TLG goes and ups their game again.</p>

<p>Now, aside from the Owen minifigure, the build included in the foil pack is nothing special, and the part selection is average at best. The build is some sort of outdoor computer station that Owen presumably uses to monitor the parks&#39; dinosaurs, but it&#39;s not from the movie and doesn&#39;t really feature any interesting play features.</p>

<p>All in all, I&#39;d rate this set at a 4 out of 5 stars. It&#39;s a cheap (even if you&#39;re in the States) way to pick up the Owen minifigure, which is excellent, but if you&#39;re planning on buying any of the other Jurassic World sets that contain Owen, I&#39;d go ahead and skip this one.</p>
