I like all of the pieces, vehicles, buildings, scenery; and so on to make a great LEGO world. Not much left to say other than what a great game! I still wished I got the limited edition LEGO man on a motorcycle...<br>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,4

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-05-03T04:45:15.757Z","LEGO Gear (Video Games/PC) - LEGO Creator Review","<p>This game may be a good videogame but I don't think that this is the 
best one I've got. In this game you're able to create your own city with
 some buildings, vehicles and minifigs from the LEGO Town theme. The 
city could look cool and you can also bring it to life if you want to. </p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nice way to build a city<br></li><li>You can bring your city to life<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Could be boring after a while<br></li></ul><h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all it's a great game to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.</p>",TRUE,5,1,5,5,5
