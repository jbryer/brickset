<p>The best construction game of all time, other than Rock Raiders! The houses! The screaming babies! The getting new parts during the holidays! I just need to figure out the 2 player mode, and how to get a path onto the post office, what the yellow tunnels are for, and how to get some of the stuff in the picture on the box.</p>

It got boring after awhile. :/ But the building experience is very nice because you get a nice selection of railroad tracks, buildings, train carts, and scenery pieces. It was very playable too, I haven't had any problems with the game. You may like this game, I didn't so much.<br>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,3

You're able to create your own city and add a train if you want to. What I don't like about this game is that you have to wait a little bit after you've brought to life. <br></p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul><li>You can create your own city<br>
</li><li>You can bring your city to life<br>
</li></ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul><li>You have to wait if you want to see the first minifigs walking around your city</li><li>Voice of the minifigs could be annoying<br></li></ul>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all it's a great game to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.</p></div></div>",TRUE,4,1,4,4,4

You can build a town, drive trains though it, send letters, and much much more. This may sound boring, but it is better than the new lego games. I really suggest you find this game on the internet and get it.<br>",TRUE,5,1,1,5,5
