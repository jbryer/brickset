You can play with Pirates or Western theme boards and men; plus they beat each other up during a battle!  Everytime a man is captured, a Capture short is played, in which the two men will perform a LEGO interpretation of Roadrunner/Wile.E. Coyote/Bugs Bunny/Elmer Fudd.  
   It has beautiful music in it, and the boards and locations are each different.  It also has a Campaign Mode, in which you watch movies that lead into a series of chess games,with you as white.  My favorite are the Pirates, yet even though the movies are Pirates against Soldiers/Armada, the pieces are pirates and soldiers on each side.  Why not Pirate vs. Soldiers?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-20T14:27:53Z","good","i like it, the lego king is very nice, in story mode the lego scenes are very good(when the sheriff is going to capture the thiefs, or when you are in your ship and captain roger appears in his ship..etc) but the cartoons when you capture other piece are TERRIBLE! ARGGGGGGGGGG! i think this is because that game is destined to childs, but childs are not necessary stupid... and the pieces are pirates and soldiers on each side, and in western mode are indians and american soldiers(when the bad guys are thiefs and the good guys are the sheriff and fortress soldiers, but indians are not very important in this story)

you can learn to play chess in a good level with that game",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
