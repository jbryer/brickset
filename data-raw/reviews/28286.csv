<p>Comes in a larger brick head box. It comes with two instructions, one for Newt and one for Grindelwald.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You get two sticks (One dark brown and one brown) and also a suitcase for Newt. You get the normal printed pieces on the front and the black eyes. You do get a dark grey eye for Grindelwald&nbsp;because of the two different eye colors.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. Took me under 10 minutes to build it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>When I was finished I was really happy. These are some of the best brickheads I have bought yet. Pairing these two together was a really smart idea.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great pair of brickheads to get. I highly recommend getting these. The wands and suitcase were nice additions to them as well. The different color eyes on him was very nice as well. Overall I&#39;m it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>
