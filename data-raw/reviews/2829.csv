The gameplay is excellent, but it is hard to build the cars. If they could make the chassies larger, that would be swell. I like making extremely un-aerodynamic cars. That's another thing, why aren't the cars effected by un-aerodynamicness? 

The reason for me givin' this a 10/10, is that there is great playability, and the music is EXCELLENT! I haven't seen the computer version, but I would guess it's prettty good. The music rocks and rules.

P.S. I have alway's wanted a lego post office. If they made one, I would buy 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"legobagel","2011-01-01T12:15:51.053Z","Best (and only) LEGO game on the Nintendo 64","<p>In the summer of 2009 i decided to get out my 12 year old Nintendo 64 which in my honest opinion is the best console ever made and afetr playing some games for a couple of days i decided that i wanted to go on eBay and buy some of popular Nintendo 64 and others that would interest me and one day i came across LEGO racers which i thought would be a great additon to my N64 collection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But enough bragging about me and my wonderful times with my nintendo 64 and on to the game review.now since this is a game it dosent&nbsp;includes any minifigs or any LEGO bricks just the normal stuff you would get with a N64, however most N64&nbsp;games you would get second hand would just include the cartidges.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game itself is a kart racing game (like mario kart 64) and has the same identical features that mario kart 64 has such as the grand prix, time trials and multiplayer races but one unique feature about this game is the way you can build your own car out of LEGO i found this feature to be interesting&nbsp; but unfortulay it didnt work that well and had very annoying music.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The races themself were enjoyable to play and The racecorsues&nbsp;had very interseting designs and were based off LEGO themes around the time (such as pirates, adventures, space and castle) and scenery and grapics were fine to look at.thoughtout the races you will come across some item boxes (which are similar to the items boxes from mario kart) but include basic items such as the octan speed boost,cannons and barrier to protect yourself from incoming fire from enemy racers.speaking of racers you face againist 5 other racers and these racers are charcters from certain LEGO themes this characters give you challenges to race agianist and if you win you get a trophy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>overall this is the best (and only) LEGO game on the Nintendo 64 and to anyone who has a N64 should get this game.</p>

"TBOC","2018-09-23T08:22:04.607Z","A good port with few issues","<p>Lego Racers is one of my personal favorite Lego games, back before they were mostly based on licensed&nbsp;IP&#39;s. I played the PC version to death as a kid, and a few years back when I finally picked up a Nintendo 64, I figured I couldn&#39;t go wrong with a classic title (especially as one of the cheaper N64 games).</p>

<p>One thing to note, especially for the majority of people who might be buying this without a box: this game requires a Nintendo 64 Controller Pak to save data. Otherwise, you cannot save your progress. This was common to most third party games at the time. I didn&#39;t commit to memory how many pages you&#39;ll need on one, but it didn&#39;t seem to be many. Word to the wise.</p>

<p>For the game itself, it plays somewhat identically to the PC version. You face the same people, drive on the same maps, etc. For those who have never experienced it, Lego Racers is a racing game similar to other titles at the time like Mario Kart 64. You control a minifigure (you can customize) and a kart (you can build, or choose a preset), and race against a handful of other racers to beat them. There are 6 &quot;cups&quot; and one final boss to defeat, and each cup has 4 tracks. There are really only 3 unique cups, with the 3 later being mirror matches played in backwards order.</p>

<p>Lego Racers uses many classic and 90&#39;s Lego themes, such as: Pirates, Islanders, Insectoids, Adventurers, and so on. You take on several characters who &quot;host&quot; the cups, and when you beat them in a series of 4 races, you win their car parts and minifigure&nbsp;parts. These include characters such as Basil the Batlord, Gypsy Moth, Captain Brickbeard, and Johnny Thunder.</p>

<p>Like contemporary games, you can race and find &quot;weapons&quot; to use against rival racers or to boost your own racer. These show up as colored 1x3 bricks, as well as 1x2 white bricks which increase the &quot;intensity&quot; of the weapons effect up to three times. This can fundamentally change the nature of the item (for example, a base yellow brick is Oil Slick, while one with three white bricks is a &quot;Pharaoh&#39;s Curse&quot; which inverts controls and further messes up the player.</p>

<p>The only major differences between this and other ports are the control schemes and use of FMV. The Nintendo 64 cartridges had limited space, and therefore couldn&#39;t necessarily hold all the data needed for hefty FMV&#39;s. This doesn&#39;t really translate into anything lost, although the video is sort of charming. Not a big loss, but it may have been a stark difference at the time of release. However, that being nearly 20 years ago softens the blow a little.</p>

<p>I personally found controllers a little harder on the N64, as joysticks have a tendency to wear out some. However, for the price it&#39;s hard to find fault with the small things. I also enjoyed the Rumble Pak compatibility, as it helps me test out if my Rumble Paks work.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for the definitive version of Lego Racers, it might be worth getting the PC version and either using an old enough computer (XP might be the latest operating system that works) or using a virtual machine. However, if you&#39;re looking for a good non-Mario Kart racing game with a lot of charm, try Lego Racers. It&#39;s pretty cheap, and well worth it.</p>
