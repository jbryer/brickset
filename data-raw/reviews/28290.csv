<p>Getting&nbsp;Horace as a minifigure&nbsp;for the first time and&nbsp;Dolores the second time with a big improvement from that last one back in 2007.</p>

<p>Madame look like they added a bit so&nbsp;not to look like the exact same from the 2010 version;&nbsp;thought the problem I have with this figure is that she doesn&#39;t have her golden eye on one side, but the the side with the goggles on has them. It&#39;s pretty disappointing that she doesn&#39;t have the same color eyes on both side.</p>

<p>I love&nbsp;the&nbsp;use of that&nbsp;fur collar piece&nbsp;on Snape for the cat instead of not having it and looking strange.</p>

<p>Besides for that disappointment with the eye on Madame;&nbsp;these figures are perfect for the Harry Potter collection and a classroom display.</p>

The only thing I was disappointed about was that Snape didn&#39;t come with a wand even though each of the rest of the minifigs came with wands. Snape is definitely my favorite of the bunch, just because of the hilarious outfit.</p>

<p>I have the entire set of HP/FP series 1 collectible minifigures, plus all of the 2018 HP &amp; FB lego sets. This promotional set enhances the playability of my HP/FB collection! I can&#39;t wait to collect the new 2019 sets and&nbsp;recently announced HP/FB series 2 collectible minifigures to be released in 2020!</p>
