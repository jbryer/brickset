"ShadowWolfHount","2019-03-14T22:29:42.567Z","Kinda disappointing","<p>Compare to the other 2018 bricktober packs, Owen and Claire doesn&#39;t look that interesting to get, least Claire have different clothes, Owen just have a different shirt, least he have an arm printing and we get different face printings along with goofy ones with Owen.</p>

<p>The baby Raptor&nbsp;you can easily get in two sets, would been nice to get a different printing.</p>

<p>Ian is pretty much the only one that is really worth getting from this, especially&nbsp;as this is currently the only thing&nbsp;to get him.</p>

<p>I think this pack would be a lot better if it have character that are unlikely to be seen or rare to see in future Jurassic sets,&nbsp;like&nbsp;Dennis Nedry and&nbsp;John Hammond.</p>
