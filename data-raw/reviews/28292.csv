"MutoidMan","2018-11-20T16:03:16.513Z","Essential minifigs for your Infinity War collection","<p>This is a&nbsp;neat set that supplies&nbsp;previously unavailable&nbsp;characters or&nbsp;versions of characters to augment&nbsp;the regular Infinity War sets.</p>

<p>By borrowing a few figs (the appearance of whose have&nbsp;not changed&nbsp;appreciably)&nbsp;from other Marvel sets (i.e.&nbsp;Scarlet Witch, Okoye, Mantis, Drax, Nebula, Hulk, and Loki)&nbsp;it&rsquo;s now possible to stage&nbsp;all battles from the movie with the complete cast of characters. You could even pull Maria Hill and Nick Fury from the SHIELD&nbsp;Helicarrier&nbsp;set to re-enact the post-credit scene.</p>

<p>From the set: &ldquo;White Wolf&rdquo; Bucky with his Wakandan&nbsp;arm and the new&nbsp;War Machine, both of whom l would say look great, round out the battle in Wakanda sets. Tony Stark in his nano-sweatsuit&nbsp;and Wong, who are both nicely detailed, complete the NYC battle.</p>

<p>From other sets:&nbsp;I&rsquo;d use Hulk (before Ragnarok)&nbsp;and Loki&nbsp;to play out the battle against Thanos&nbsp;on the Asgardian&nbsp;ship at the start of Infinity War.&nbsp;Mantis,&nbsp;Drax, and Nebula&nbsp;would round out the battle on Titan.&nbsp;Finally, Scarlet Witch and Okoye complete the Wakandan&nbsp;team.</p>

"ShadowWolfHount","2019-03-14T22:57:58.11Z","fine addition to an MCU minifig collation","<p>Getting some other version of Marvel characters for Buckey (who wasn&#39;t in any of the Infinity War sets), What Tony was wearing before Earth was invaded, and a new suit for War Machine. Plus Wong is now made into a minifigure.</p>

<p>All of them having great detail,&nbsp;having arm and side leg printing.&nbsp;The face printing on war machine with two sided face being in the same way as Tony from the Infinity War sets of a head up display (in red), make me wish that face is used on future War Machine figure, though it&#39;s unlikely.</p>

<p>But while I like War Machine, I honestly think it would be better for him to be replace with another character who hasn&#39;t been made into minifigure&nbsp;(as we already have 2 different war machine version in past sets) like&nbsp;Janet van Dyne. But that&#39;s just a nitpick.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-29T12:41:03.9Z","Let the Infinity War, Begin!","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #5005256 Marvel Super Heroes Collection:</b> Such a shame this was not made available as widely as it could have, for it features some must own Minifigures for a Marvel Super Heroes collection. If you were fortunate enough to get this then you know exactly what I mean.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This packaging is much like the others found in the Promotional sets with a plastic tray used to house the Minifigures while a matching coloured box is used based on which Theme the Minifigures hail from. In this case we have a red box with a rich yellow similar to the Marvel Theme, but also hearkening to Iron Man&rsquo;s costume. The Infinity War logo is on the front as well. Serviceable packaging for what you&rsquo;re getting.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Tony Stark: Dressed in his jumpsuit from Infinity War, Tony Stark has double-sided torso printing, arm printing and leg printing for the track suit style outfit he wore when first meeting Doctor Strange in Infinity War. He has no accessories, but highly detailed printing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">War Machine: Full of immense detail, this Minifigure represents the final battle in Wakanda with War Machine&rsquo;s outfit during that encounter. He has some great printing, the armoured helmet even features some excellent detail around the eyes, and he has two different facial expressions, one with Head&rsquo;s Up Display, the other without.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Winter Soldier: With dual-moulded legs and some very impressive detail work, as is standard for this pack, features Bucky from Infinity War. Carrying a space gun he is the first figure to have an accessory in the set. His facial expressions include a determined scowl and a tooth gritting glower. No smiling for this Minifigure.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Wong: This final character in the set is from Doctor Strange, although he also appears in Infinity War naturally. He has dual-moulded legs with highly detailed printing for his costume and is carrying a printed 2x4 tile to represent one of the many mystical tomes he is in charge of protecting.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is one of those sets that is hard to quantify in most respects. It is loaded with highly detailed Minifigures, but is it worth picking up on the Secondary Market? I would suggest that if you can get it for a very good price you will more than likely want to get this one. I would mostly recommend this for Marvel fans. Recommended.</p>

"Helichopter21","2019-03-16T17:41:39.877Z","Best Minifigure Pack Ever!","<p>When this promotional pack was first revealed, being a fan of the MCU, I really wanted it. Unfortunately, because Toys R Us closed where I live, I was worried that I would not be able to get it. However, this was recently available in the U.S. as a gift with purchase at shop.lego.com, so now that mine has arrived, I will review it.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>Four minifigs are included: War Machine, Wong, Tony Stark, and Bucky Barnes (White Wolf). War Machine is an incredibly detailed figure. There is literally printing from head to toe. This figure has nice detailed printing on both the front and the back of his torso. Unfortunately, if you want to appreciate the level of detail on the back, you will have to remove the cannon mounted on his shoulder. There is nice detail on the hips, legs, feet, and both arms. The face is two-sided. One side features a smile, and the other has a red heads-up display over his face, similar to the one that Iron Man has in two of the Infinity War sets from last year. It looks great on the whole, and this may be my favorite Marvel minifigure to date.</p>

<p>Wong is also a great figure to collect, as this is the only set that he comes in. There is nice detailing on both sides of the torso, hips, and legs. The legs are dual-molded, which is nice. He also has the Book of Cagliostro, which is a printed 2 by 2 tile. This is another great figure to get, particularly if you are a fan of Doctor Strange.</p>

<p>Tony Stark is also included in this set, and the only other time we&#39;ve gotten him without an Iron Man suit was in the Malibu Mansion set from 2013. This figure is updated for Infinity War, when Tony Stark gets a compartment for nanotech&nbsp;parts put in his chest. This figure represents him when he is in the park with Pepper in one of the first scenes of the movie and when he visits the Sanctum Sanctorum to talk with Doctor Strange. I think this figure looks great, especially the torso piece. There is detailed printing on both sides of the torso and the arms, which looks great. The silver details on the torso continue onto the hips and the legs, which looks great. There are two faces, a confident smile and a frightened or shocked expression. The hairpiece also works pretty well for the character as well.</p>

<p>The last figure included in this pack is Bucky, as seen in Infinity War. We&#39;ve gotten the Winter Soldier figure before, but here Bucky is the White Wolf. Just like with the other figures, the quality&nbsp;is great.&nbsp;I think the torso printing accurately reflects the character that was in the movie. Even though it is pretty basic printing, I think it works well. The legs are dual-molded, and there is printing for a holster on his right leg. His left arm (the metallic arm) has additional printing, which I think looks great. Both facial expressions look angry and battle-ready. This is another figure that I&#39;m glad to add to my collection.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>As said in the title, I think this is the best Bricktober minifigure&nbsp;pack to date. All four minifigures have incredible detail and print quality, and I am glad to add all four to my Marvel minifigure collection. With so many characters in <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em>, Lego had a challenge trying to get as many as possible into a limited number of sets. I think they did the best that they could, but some characters were left out. I am glad this pack was made because as a fan of the MCU, I am really happy that I was able to get my hands on this pack. In fact, the detailing on these figures is so good that I wish Lego would continue that quality and level of detail on more of the Marvel minifigures&nbsp;in boxed sets. Hopefully another one of these will be made for&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Endgame</em>, as there are several characters I would like to get in their regular superhero attire instead of their quantum suits.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the closing of Toys R Us has made this pack very difficult to obtain, and as such, it is quite expensive through third party sellers. If Lego does something like this again this year, I hope they make the packs more readily available to everyone. If you got it as a GWP, you got a great pack, and hopefully it will be available in places other than third party sellers.&nbsp;I recommend&nbsp;it to all fans of Marvel Superheroes and the MCU, especially if you can find it at a reasonable price.</p>
