<p>Let&#39;s start the review in the way of reading a manga and so begin with NYA: She features a beautiful asian-style clothing with some nice floral- and dragon-printing on the front, back and legs, as well as a golden bracelet on her right wrist. Her face is double-sided, with a smiling or smirking expression and some nice kabuki-face printing. She is equipped with a fan that has a floral printing on it that looks like cherry-blossoms on a tree. In my opinion she is very useful for every kind of asian MOC-sceneries and not limited to the &quot;NINJAGO-world&quot;.</p>

<p>Next we have MOHAWK, a member of the SOG-gang. Instead of his colleagues he has a black spikey mohawk and a very &quot;happy-evil&quot; face. Must be because he wields a sliver baseball bat, wears a black jacket with ripped-off sleeves, the SOG-logo on his back and a nice grey shirt with a skull on it. AND maybe because he has a high detailed trouser print with a keychain that goes over his right leg as well as a chain-tattoo and a tattoo of the gang-logo on his right arm, that look really outstanding. He is the highlight of the whole gang of SOG-members!! And like Nya, this guy easily can inhabit sceneries, that have nothing in common with NINJAGO.</p>

<p>The third is FUTURE JAY. Well, I&#39;m not that much of a fan of this character, but this minifigure blew me away, and is the best version of him so far! He has detailed leg-printing featuring blue straps that go over on both sides and end in a nice silver printing of a buckle. Also his arms have side printing, featuring a blue and silver lining over a tiny silver-dotted pattern that also is printed on the white parts of the torso. These little details add a lot to a potential futuristic look of a traditional-styled asian clothing. Jay is equipped with a staff and has only one face expression, featuring an eyepatch and a musketeer-styled beard.</p>

<p>The last one is HARUMI. She, like Jay, has detailed printing on both arms and legs, and on her torso that really catch the look she had in the series, when wearing the mask of hate. By the way, she also has a new version of that mask, featuring an open mouth and slightly different eyes. Harumi too has a double sided face with a maliciously smiling and angry teeth-grinding expression that really capture the spirit of that character. She is equipped with two red swords.</p>

<p>But why is it the best of all bricktober-sets? Well that&#39;s simple: Value for money!!! All figures are equipped with accessories and have detailed printing - also on legs and arms. AND we get three exclusive items: a silver baseball bat, an fan and a new mask of hate! Also, as I mentioned before, this set is not only for fans, but also for fans of brilliantly designed characters.</p>

<p>AND... the JURASSIC WORLD and the MARVEL sets simply annoy me: The first one for cheating (why a miniature dinosaur instead of a minifigure?!) and the second for making all the die-hard-marvel-fans go nuts by nearly releasing all the missing figures from this years Infinity War ... in a LIMITED set!! And HARRY POTTER... well, I&#39;m sorry Harry, you&#39;re cool, but I can&#39;t collect everything...&nbsp; ;-)</p>
