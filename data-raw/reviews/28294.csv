<p data-fulltext="""" data-placeholder=""Tradução"" dir=""ltr"" id=""tw-target-text"">The set cost $ 15, which was a good price for this set, but unfortunately to buy the set new these days may be a little more expensive, although the price of the set has not increased much.</p>

<h2 data-fulltext="""" data-placeholder=""Tradução"" dir=""ltr"">Pros</h2>

<p data-fulltext="""" data-placeholder=""Tradução"" dir=""ltr"">&raquo; Realistic design.</p>

<p data-fulltext="""" data-placeholder=""Tradução"" dir=""ltr"">&raquo; Good stickers.</p>

<p data-fulltext="""" data-placeholder=""Tradução"" dir=""ltr"">&raquo; Good&nbsp;minifigures.</p>

<p data-fulltext="""" data-placeholder=""Tradução"" dir=""ltr"">&raquo; The design of the vehicle is not out of date so it can be used with the latest police vehicles.</p>

<h2>Cons</h2>

<p>&raquo; Some stickers cover more than one piece so if we dismantle the set we lose those stickers.</p>

<p>&raquo; The set could have included handcuffs.</p>

<h2>Conclusion:</h2>

<p data-fulltext="""" data-placeholder=""Tradução"" dir=""ltr"" id=""tw-target-text"">The set is good but it could have included more improvements to make it better from its 2005 version because the only differences in the set are that the stickers are no longer black and turned blue.</p>

Recently I&#39;ve started to rebuild it but there is one problem with it - the stickers. Stickers in this set went over many bricks which is not a good thing. Other than that it might seem this set doesn&#39;t have much to offer, with just 98 pieces it still is enough for a child or just as a first Lego set. It includes two minifigures - police officer and crook. The main build of this set is the van itself which includes one seat for the driver and the whole back for the prisoner, it can fit more than one minifigure. There isn&#39;t nothing much else other than handcuffs and speaker. That&#39;s about it but this set is as classic Lego City as it gets. New police sets should be made by the old formula. But I guess we all need a change at some point.</p>
