<p>A very nice micro-scale / nano-scale set of Diagon Alley, with a nice minifigure. It is a free gift if one spends 80 euros&nbsp;in the Lego store, a fairly high price, but also a limit fairly easily reached, especially in the Netherlands. The regular Hogwarts Great Hall (set 75954), Whomping Willow (set 75953), Hogwarts Express (set 75955) qualify directly, as does the combo of Newt&#39;s Case (set 75952) and Grindelwald&#39;s Escape (set 75951).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, building the set was fun, with lots of fiddly pieces. I generally like how the set is put together; how with many small pieces a nice impression(ist image)&nbsp;of Diagon&nbsp;Alley is created. The Ollivander&nbsp;minifigure is excellent, and could well become quite&nbsp;popular with collectors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, if you were considering getting some Lego for close to 60 or 70 euro&#39;s, IMHO it is worth considering spending a little more, and getting this set as well (as long as supplies last).</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>This is my first sky-line build every, and on this occasion, I liked it. It took me about 45 minutes, and frankly I can see why the recommended age is 10 years old and up. There are not too many difficult techniques used, but the construction is rather fiddly (lots of small pieces), and because of it, it might quickly become boring/tedious to younger kids.</p>

<p>The build sequence is logical, moving (in layers) from right (Weasley Wizard&#39;s Wheezes) to the left. I really like the way the Top Hat Character with&nbsp;WWW is constructed. That said, the way most of the smaller buildings are constructed is nice. The one thing I cannot fathom is why there are no 2x1 rounded white plates used to fix the entry to Gringotts to the &#39;back wall&#39; (i.e. the side wall next to Ollivander&#39;s), as there are to fix the other side-wall. It would make the structure quite a bit sturdier, and would have no impact on the looks of the building.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Due to the nature of the set (nano-scale, lots of colour) there are a lot of spare pieces, the most special arguably the black sausage used to support the top hat. The &#39;cobbled surface&#39; 2x4 tiles are nice as well, and could be very useful (and sought after) for MOCs.</p>

<h2>The minifigure</h2>

<p>Garrick Ollivander&#39;s&nbsp;minifigure is quite nice. He has no print on the legs, only on the torso.The semi-shabby/disheveled look of his waistcoat, cravat and jacket gives the figure a lot of character. The print is also highly detailed. I also really like his hair piece (a balding head). He has two face-print, showing sizable&nbsp;sideburns, and two quite expressive faces. One is fairly neutral, or might depict him concentrating on the selection of a wand for a customer, while the other seems to show him somewhat frightened, as if suddenly being confronted by snatchers trying to capture him for Voldemort. IMHO it is one of the better minifigures&nbsp;so far released in the 2018 Harry Potter line (collectible minifigs and those in sets).</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, I like the overall design of the set, bookended by two of the larger and iconic buildings in Diagon&nbsp;Alley. I like the choice for grey rather than white columns for Gringotts, as all white would result in a rather boring structure. There is a lot of colour&nbsp;in this set. The chosen techniques are smart and - on this scale and from a distance - quite effective. Highlight for me - in this set - is the tip hat minifigure&nbsp;sign for WWW.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs Display.</h2>

<p>This set is only good for display, as intended.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Generall, I am not a fan of these nano-scale&nbsp;sky-line designs (as now integral part to the Architecture series). That said, to me this set is an exception, mostly because of the subject matter. It is colourful, and the inclusion of the Ollivander&nbsp;minifig is a nice added bonus. IMHO this is a very nice gift with purchase. Is it worth spending 80 euros for all on its own? No, of course not (unless you are a die hard collector). That said, IMHO, if one intends to get some sets (or a bigger set) for Christmas, or just a treat for yourself, it is worth considering moving up that purchase, or go for a slightly bigger set in order to receive this set as a gift.</p>

"KoolKreeper489","2018-11-21T19:42:43.72Z","Diagon Alley Review","<p>The&nbsp;Diagon Alley set is a nice microscale set from the Wizarding World theme. It was available with purchases over $99 between November 19 to November 21. It comes with 5 microscale buildings in Diagon Alley amd 1 minifigure.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p><strong>Garrick Ollivander- </strong>A Great exclusive minifigure to get with great printing. 10/10</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Diagon Alley looks good in microscale. It looks better is person than it does in the picture. The back of it doesn&#39;t have much detail but Gringotts bank and the Weasley&nbsp;brothers shop have some interior details. This set has 6 printed pieces for cobblestone and no stickers.&nbsp;The set looks great from the front and is only for display there is no playability for this set. 9/10</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>I got this set with the Hogwarts Great Hall and I think this is a great set. It looks good for display and looks fine for microscale. The minifigure is good&nbsp;and this set is a great promotional set.</p>

"snazzybricks928","2019-01-01T20:55:25.063Z","Another Must-Have Set In Your Wizarding World","<p>Diagon&nbsp;Alley is a promotional set from The Lego Shop with purchases of $100 USD or more. It is worth around $25-30 USD and has a wide assortment of colors and parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u>Pros:</u></b></p>

<p>Wide assortment of somewhat rare pieces in somewhat rare colors</p>

<p>Mr. Ollivander is wonderful in his new minifigure form: only 2 have been made, counting this recent (at the writing of this review) version of him, with&nbsp;a brown coat and gray suit. He has a dark orange-brown wand.</p>

<p>Weasley&#39;s Wizard Wheezes is a large building in the movie series, so it is one of two buildings that has an interior, the other being Gringotts Bank. The Weasley shop has a counter with crates and boxes in orange and bright green. Gringotts&nbsp;Bank has two counters for the goblin bankers. This set also includes Flourish And Blotts, Ollivander&#39;s, and the Quidditch store that has a name that is escaping my mind right now. There are also two lampposts and an entrance to Nocturn Alley.</p>

<p>The curved pillars on Gringotts Bank are captured wonderfully. There is also a trophy piece on a pillar in front of Gringotts&nbsp;which I do not remember.</p>

<p>The Weasley&#39;s shop also has a double sided head on top.</p>

<p><b><u>Cons:</u></b></p>

<p>This set has almost no playability.</p>

<p><b><u>Overall Rating: 4.7</u></b></p>

<p>This is another Must-Have set for your collection of Wizarding World.</p>
