Of the Mcdonalds they are the more Lego Bionicle. Kongu's colors is green with some differences from Lewa. His Mask is the classic Miru from lewa, and his other feature is the disc launcher (the set launchs the disc with its arm), derived from the Slizers (also called throwbots) and years after used again in the bionicle of 2004. The matoran unfortunately have few pieces. I rate 4/5",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Blade","2008-04-07T22:38:28.56Z","Matoran Kongu!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. LEGO did away with the Slizers and the Robo Riders at the end of 2000. This was due to this awesome series, Bionicle starting in 2001. There is quite an extensive story to Bionicle so if you are interested most of it can be found at www.bioniclestory.com

Where these guys fit into the story is, On the island of Mata Nui all was well. There were six tribes who lived in six different areas on the island, each filled with small villagers called Matoran, led by a Turaga elder. Matoran villagers of Mata Nui live and work in six villages around the island. This little guy is a promotional version of a Matoran and his name is Kongu.

He was only released promotionally at McDonald's with a Happy Meal so you can't expect too much from him. He is a whole eight pieces including disk and is much smaller than the Turaga. His colour Scheme is light Green and Aqua. He has the same mask as Toa Lewa, but in Aqua, making it rare. The mask is the Kanohi Miru, the Great Mask of Levitation.

His weapon is throwing disk, similar to that of the Slizers. The throwing arm is alot shorter though and is very flexible. I have had mine for over five years and it is still in perfect condition. The disk can be thrown over five meters reasonably accurately, once you get the hang of it, making them quite fun to play with.

The Instructions for this set are good too. They show lots of pictures, how to combine the Matoran to make bigger and better models from three or all six of them. Also on the other side is a nice poster with this Matoran standing next to his Toa.

Overall for a promotional item these are quite good with reasonable aesthetics and good playability. They add another dimension to the Bionicle World and shouldn't be pushed aside due to there size. I feel this model is a 5/10 and is much deserving of a place in anyone's bionicle collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

He is really rare in Matoran form, and you could only get him from McDonalds. I got him, but my cousin broke it and I had to buy another one off eBay. The early Bionicles were the best because the whole point was to collect them. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Easy to Build
Fun to play with

Cons:
Can lose the discs quite easily

"123MrBrick","2015-07-15T00:22:35.783Z","Kongu, Perhaps the Most Famous Le-Matoran.","<p>I recently got 5 of the McToran (the six McDonalds Bionicle figures) from ebay and I am very happy with them. Kongu is probably the most similar to his respective Toa, but he is still unique in his own ways.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I got these figures loose so I can&#39;t really say anything here. Look at Brickset&#39;s picture if you want to see the polybag.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Kongu shares all of his parts, with the exception of the mask, with his fellow McToran. However, Kongu features the parts in unique colors. I really like his Bamboo Disk, which features the Kanohi Miru on it, and the Miru itself, which is a tealish color this time.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set takes maybe 30 seconds. There are only 8 parts in the set, and it is extremely simple to peg it all together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really like the finished product. While it is not the most realistic design, the figure still looks cool. He has several features: his right arm will throw the included Bamboo Disk when pulled back; his other arm will &quot;punch&quot; when pulled back, and he can store his Bamboo Disk on his back. I am kind of worried that the arms will break, but so far nothing has happened. I&nbsp; have not been able to knock his mask off with a punch or Disk throw, which is kind of disappointing.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set will really only appeal to Bionicle fans. Unless you really want to get the whole set of them, I think getting one McToran will bring you the same amount of fun as getting all of them. I mainly got these for the Kanohi masks.</p>

"Matroxide","2012-06-16T08:10:37.45Z","He is Like a Little Lewa","Swinging from the branches of Le-Koro, the acrobatic Matoran Kongu spot a villainous Nui Rama flying above his head. He grabs his Miru imprinted bamboo disk and aims. With precision and accuracy, the disk finds its unsuspecting prey. Kongu was my second matoran of 2001, but still one of my favorites. He is in this small state because he was forced in a matoran sphere, and forgot all about Metru Nui; or at least in the story line. Kongu and the other matoran of 2001 were basicaly the best McDonalds toy ever as it was&nbsp;a real Bionicle set. the set comes with a blueish-green Kanohi Miru, lime green body and arms, feet that are the same blueish-green color, and a disk with&nbsp;a picture of the&nbsp;mask of levitation on it. Kongu&nbsp;by himself is&nbsp;lots of fun, but&nbsp;I like to own the complete set of all&nbsp;six matoran. Kongu kan also combine with Matoro and Macku to make a&nbsp;Matoran Kaita that looks like&nbsp;a miniature&nbsp;Wairuha, or combine with all six to make a Matoran Nui. and if that was not enough, in the packet was a mini comic called ""The Challenge of the Rahi"" and it shows the matoran nui!",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5

He was my second matoran and one of the best six promo from McDonalds, as Lego gave them the parts. His disk always hits it's mark for the priciple of Le-Koro is Accuracy! When I got him, as ussual, build is grand but the complete model is awesome! I remeber playing with him for a while with my other Bionicles for a long time. The disk function is nice.",FALSE,5,5,3,5,5
"Xan","2015-03-10T21:59:20.733Z","A neat set with nice teal colours. ","<p>This is my first review on Brickset, so here we go.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The packaging of the set works in making the overall product look nice, with an illustration of Kongu throwing his disk at something, no clue as to what. The instructions are not really needed, as this set only consists of eight different pieces. There is however promotional artwork as well as pictures of different combiner models that can be built with all of the different McDonalds Matoran.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>For the parts you get, it depends. If you are mainly a system fan, then you might not enjoy the selection of parts. For a fan of Constraction though, the part selection would be more exciting. The set features a re colour&nbsp; of a very well known mask among the Bionicle&nbsp;community. There are three teal parts, which is a colour rarely or never seen anymore. Like the other five, this also includes a black Slizer throwing disk, with a picture of the mask printed on it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build isn&#39;t challenging, and could take as little as 30 seconds. The model was however given out for free at McDonalds, so one cannot expect an in depth build on this model.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>For a promo set, this model is satisfying enough , and looks overall esthetically&nbsp;pleasing to the eye, with the right balance of colour.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>If you&nbsp;happen to find this set cheap, then I would recommend&nbsp;giving it a chance. These sets can go for quite a lot of money on eBay and Bricklink sealed.</p>
