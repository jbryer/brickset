It has spawned a sequel, LEGO Racers 2, which is not as good as the original in my opinion. The original is basically an enormous collection of LEGO sets from around 1990-1998, incorporated into racetracks and courses. There are Pirates, Indigo Islanders, UFOs, Insectoids, Exploriens, Adventurers and Castle, with many other things from LEGO history. You can design a car from scratch, using pieces won through the Circuit Mode, participate in Circuit races (like Grand Prix), play a single race, go head-to-head with a friend or do time-trial mode. This all combines to create a very good racing game. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Those two are to different to compare. The first game is based on old discountinued LEGO Systems, but the second have better realistic cars and tracks but this is a so good game.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-19T06:02:39Z","First pc game","I have to say that this is far better than the 2nd one. Yes in the second one you get to roam about and you lose bricks and you can improve your car BUT there is one outstanding feature. Rocket racer is harder to beat in the first one (so much for making a comeback). This would get a ten but there is the matter of the tracks and the power up known as the mummies curse (it sends a shiver up your spine just hearing it).",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-10-08T21:09:25Z","Best game!","  I love this game.  It's very addicting, with incredibly diverse tracks and worlds.  I like the circuit system and those zany powerups with equally looney drivers.  I have played the sequel, but I like the arcade style of Racers One more.  Also, the diversity is another reason I like One better.  
But, I do like the fact in the sequal flat bricks are offered and that your car can be atominzied.  If they made like a Racers Three with the same style and similar tracks like Racers One and the flat bricks and atominization of cars from Racers Two, that would be the best game.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

INTRO
Ah, I remember this game from when I was a little kid.   Back then when my friends and I wanted to play video games, I'd take Lego Racers out of its old beat-up case.  I also re-call hunched over the computer screen with my heart beating a mile-a-minute, trying to win against Veronica Voltage.  However, I will try to forget all this and look at the game as an outsider.

THE BEGINNIG
When I first turned this game I was really impressed by the opening movie. After that you are taken to the main menu.  It has 7 options (if you count quit). BUILD- Let's you build a car and driver, SINGLE RACE- Let's you compete in a single race, CICRUT RACE- The main game mode where you race on four different tracks.  Against 1 head cheese, and four other racers.  Points are awarded for each place, and who ever has the most at the end wins.  If you come in second or first you advance to the next circuit, however you must come first to win the lead racer's car, TIME TRIAL- everyone knows Veronica Voltage right? If not you will quickly come to hate her, VERSUS- Let's you and a friend race head on, OPTIONS- Change the sound, fx volume, etc., and QUIT- Quit (duh).

DIFFICUALTY
Unless you count Veronica and her ghost car, Lego Racers is a fairly easy game you can beat in a day or two.

LEVELS AND FETURES
LEVELS- The Levels aren't exactly in-genus, when you compare then to other kart racing games of that time (CTR- remember oxide station? or Mario Kart- simply the best!), however they never failed to do one thing- integrate the sets!  Even though I didn't know it back then (The sets of the 1990's were before my time), I was traveling through Lego Land.  The levels in Lego Racers are jammed full of 90's sets from the ice planet level to Captain Redbeard him self.  Why, even today if I play Lego Racers, then take out my Exploriens collection, I feel like I'm still in the game.
FETURES- Over 10 different weapons and a gazillion racer make this game worth playing.

DRAWBACKS
The only real problems with this game are lack of different levels, and slowish cars.  However none of that can take away from the sheer fun of playing this game.

THE END
There is not much replay value after the credits roll, besides making a better racer.

OVERALL
For those few drawbacks and Veronica being to hard for a little kid to beat, I give this game an 8/10.  However nothing can deduct from the fact this game is a classic.

"starwarsgeek101_","2008-04-15T20:42:44.593Z","Outstanding game!","This game is one of my favorite games in my life. I love the 13 different tracks and how you can build your own race-car with your own ideas. This game features characters from actual lego sets and themes like Basil the Batlord, Captain Redbeard, King Kahuka, Johnny Thunder and more! This also lets you play against veronica voltage in &quot;time race&quot;. You can also play a versus game against a friend or relative. There is no difficulty level in this so you'll either Ace it or Fail it, but it is easy enough or someone at age 7 to master the game.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Good:
Old Lego themes become timeless
When you beat all the levels in the scenario in first place, you get the boss and their cars
Tracks are Awesome!

Bad:
NONE!

Pros:
easy to play 
fun 
challenging (at times)
great tracks 
build your own car is AWESOME!
play with friends

Cons:

This game gets a 5/5. It is a great game and worth playing. It is fun and will keep you busy if you're bored.

"king_kahuka_14","2009-06-13T05:57:29.61Z","BEST LEGO GAME EVER!","I got this game when I was young and I absolutly loved it.
In the game the goal is to beat all the leaders.
the circuits are all based on themes that were hot in 1996-1999

pirates,islanders,adventurers,exploriens,dark forest,insectoids,royal knights,
frigth knights and ice planet 2002

each of the 6 competitions has 4 circuits wich are based on 
-a pirate subtheme
-a castle subtheme
-an adventurers subtheme
-a space subtheme

the circuits are really nice done and have lots of secret routes.
de upgrades are really cool and the key to win the race.
the game is quite challenging and you have to be a very good racer
to beat rocket racer.
actually the only con about the lego racers series is the fact that they didn't make a third one",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"PicnicBasketSam","2014-06-09T14:59:11.94Z","A Classic LEGO Game","<p>Okay, I found this game in a Goodwill store in great condition for $3.00, so I really can&#39;t complain about the price. The racing element is really fun and really gets challenging on the 5th circuit. The building part is a good idea, but it&#39;s kind of...um...old. The brick placement system is TERRIBLE. Driver customization is very cool, but I don&#39;t know how to get the other drivers like the mummy or Willa the Witch. I haven&#39;t beaten the 6th circuit or Rocket Racer at time of writing, because Alien Rally Asteroid is REALLY hard with Gypsy Moth. Johnny Thunder&#39;s car stinks in my inexperienced hands, but it works so well for him because all of the AI characters are perfect drivers. Also, my game didn&#39;t come with a manual, so it was hard to get used to because I couldn&#39;t find help documentation in the game. The graphics are pretty bad for this day and age: All rough-edged and geometric.<br />
PROS:<br />
-Racing element is well done.<br />
-Driver Customization.<br />
-Secret passageways.<br />
-Teleportation.<br />
-Works on Windows XP.<br />
CONS:<br />
-Custom building is pretty terrible.<br />
-Would be better with a joystick.<br />
-Does not work on Windows 7.<br />
-The Mummy&#39;s Curse.<br />
-Gypsy Moth is impossible to beat.<br />
-The graphics are bad.<br />
-No help button ingame.</p>

<p>Despite these things, the game is really fun to play, and remains good in an era overflowing with games trying to replicate the success of other, similar games.</p>
