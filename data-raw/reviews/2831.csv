INTRO
This game is basically Lego Racers for the PC with horrible graphics.

THE BEGINNING
When I first turned on my ps2, and saw the horrible graphics I knew it would be all downhill.

LEVELS AND FEATURES
LEVELS- The levels are very similar to that in Lego Racers for the PC(see my Lego Racers PC review), packed full of 90's sets.
FEATURES- Over 10 Weapons and a gazillion cars!

DRAWBACKS
This is where I had problems with the game.  Even though it is a clone of the PC version the graphics are horrible.  They're possibly the worst visuals on the ps1 ever.  I would rather see this game, with better graphics on the Dreamcast.

THE END
There is not much replay value after the credits roll.

OVERALL
I love the PC version of this game but I think this version is awful.

You can custom build your own cars, and the race tracks were simply superb. I always wished to drive my Lego vehicles and now I really can (virtually..). I remember there was a racetrack in desert, another in space. There were a few more but my brain just can't seem to remember it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
