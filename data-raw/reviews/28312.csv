The coffee shop stand is a good build that I had fun building though it does have its faults. I wish the roof for it was higher and was wider so we can see the coffee shop worker better. Everything else though sorta seems thrown in it though. Like the table and the sign I get but everything else just seems thrown in there, like I don&#39;t get why a dog, a bike, and trash can are in here. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a bad thing I&#39;m just saying it&#39;s odd. But to me my main complaint is the price. It&#39;s twenty dollars but to me it feels like a ten to fifteen dollar set thankfully for me it was on sale for sixteen when I bought it which still I feel it&#39;s overpriced. Overall though I&nbsp;really like this set but it&#39;s price is it&#39;s biggest drawback from being almost perfect.</p>

"J14T14","2018-11-17T15:36:55.88Z","""Donut"" Miss Out on This ""Corny"" Set Before it ""Pasta"" You By.","<p>(Before I begin, I am just giving you fair warning that there will be plenty of jokes and puns in this review. The name of this set is a pun in itself so I think that I am in the right to do this)</p>

<p>Just like last years surprise set,&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75204-1/Sandspeeder"">75204-1</a>&nbsp;Sand Speeder, this set popped onto target shelves&nbsp;without warning. This is not a bad thing and it actually&nbsp;appeals&nbsp;to LEGO collectors more this way since we didn&#39;t see it coming.&nbsp;This set doesn&#39;t have a &quot;latte&quot; problems, but&nbsp;this is not a perfect set.</p>

<p>The price tag of $20 US is a little steep for 146 pieces, but I managed to get this on sale for $16 US due to holiday sales kicking in. If you can get this set on sale it would be a really great deal.</p>

<p>The set comes with four minifigures and a dalmatian. This dog piece has come in 5 other sets so it is not too rare, but it is still a nice inclusion. The minifigures are also pretty nice and all of them are exclusive, though none of the parts are. Some of them are harder to get though. The torso of the guy in the dark-gray suit only comes in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70632-1/Quake-Mech"">70632-1</a>&nbsp;Quake Mech, the torso of the barista only comes in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60197-1/Passenger-Train"">60197-1</a>&nbsp;Passenger Train, and the torso of the EMT only comes in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60204-1/City-Hospital"">60204-1</a>&nbsp;City Hospital. All of these sets are pretty expensive and it is nice to get these parts in a cheaper set.</p>

<p>None of the pieces in this set are new or exclusive and most of them are pretty common. The builds are nice. The sight and the table are a little bland but still good and it wasn&#39;t a huge &quot;missed steak&quot; to include them. The trash can and banana are a fine inclusion but they aren&#39;t to &quot;a peeling.&quot;&nbsp;The donut/ coffee stand build is really good. There are two foldable table on the side that can come out, there is a rotatable display stand for the pastries, and the build for the sign on top is creative and cool. Other than that, there is nothing to outstanding about the builds.</p>

<p>Overall this is a fun little set with great minifigures and good builds. I &quot;relish&quot; the fact that this set has &quot;mustard&quot; the strength to &quot;ketchup&quot; with other sets like it. While it is not the best promotional or retail exclusive set ever, it is still nice. I don&#39;t want to get &quot;jalapeno&quot; business, but you should&nbsp;pick it&nbsp;up if you get the chance.</p>

"KingAlanI","2018-12-25T06:17:54.94Z","Nice part and minifigure pack","<p>I was attracted to this for all the food pieces. The donut and quarter pie are new/rare, though the cookies are relatively common.</p>

<p>Like many LEGO sets it suffers from having a lot of small models, particularly the table, though the sales stand (especially the rotating display case) is fine. The bicycle, banana, dog and trash can, while nice in and of themselves, feel like random additions.</p>

<p>The piececount is low for a $20 MSRP set but that&#39;s hard to judge given the special parts, high proportion of minifigures, bicycle and dog. While a Target exclusive (not even available direct from LEGO like some exclusives), various promotions of theirs plus redcard make the price alright.</p>

"Brentski","2019-01-07T22:11:24.613Z","Yum!","<p>A target exclusive, got on sale, which made the set value a little better.</p>

<p>A neat little set, minifig heavy. Great for a town setup, the special pieces are fantastic in this set. I am not into racing through a build, I think it took. Me about 40 minutes, but could easily be done in half that time if someone were rushing through.</p>

<p>My one disappointment was some of the donut pieces were unprinted, but still a great piece variety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is definetely worth picking up, I will &nbsp;probably get another one.</p>

<p>I like all the different food pieces&nbsp;included and the minifigs&nbsp;could fit into almost any lego city.</p>

<p>PROS</p>

<p>The food pieces&nbsp;and minifig accessories are great and the build is very complete.</p>

<p>CONS</p>

<p>The price is rather high (in my opinion at least)</p>

"TheBrickDudeStudios","2020-08-04T16:45:50.307Z","Great set for a LEGO city.","<h2><b>Minifigures</b></h2>

<p>This set comes with four minifigs and they are the bakery worker, a doctor, a businessman and a construction worker.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Doctor</h3>

<p>The doctor comes with orange hair with a long ponytail at the back. She has a face print with glasses and a smile with no expression on the other side. Her body has a doctor logo on the side, a blue undershirt and a pocket with a pen inside. The back of her body has a bigger doctor logo. She has plain white legs.</p>

<h3>Bakery worker</h3>

<p>The bakery worker comes with long brown hair. She has a happy face on one side and a happy face with closed eyes on the other side. Her body has a bakery apron&nbsp;with a coffee mug logo on it. The back side of her body has some lines on the left and right side. She comes with brown legs.</p>

<h3>Businessman</h3>

<p>The businessman has Obi-Wan hair in dark brown. He has a face that has a beard and no alternate expression.&nbsp;His body is a suit that has a red tie in the middle. He comes with plain dark bluish gray legs.</p>

<h3>Construction worker</h3>

<p>The construction worker has a regular red construction hat. He&nbsp;has a head print with glasses and a moustache. His body has neon stripes, a necklace, a name badge, and a pocket. He also has some neon stripes on the back. He comes with plain orange legs.</p>

<h2><strong>Builds</strong></h2>

<p>This set comes with five builds. They are the bakery stand, a bike, a trash can, a table, and a sign.</p>

<h3>Bakery stand</h3>

<p>The front of the bakery has a mug, a cash register and&nbsp;a table to put a drink on. Both sides of the bakery have a smaller table and a window. The middle and back of the stand has a machine that makes the coffee and to the left of that there is a spinning plate that has cookies on it. The top of the bakery has a canopy and a sign for the shop.</p>

<h3>Bike</h3>

<p>The bike is a simple build that has a clear stud for a light, a pair of wheels, and a basket at the back of the bike.</p>

<h3>Trash can</h3>

<p>The trash can is the simplest build. It has a trash can and a lid. You can put a banana in it if you want.</p>

<h3>Table</h3>

<p>The table has a mug, a donut, and some money on it. Below that it has a little column to hold it up.</p>

<h3>Sign</h3>

<p>The sign&nbsp;has a donut on the top and four&nbsp;colors of 1x1 round tiles below that. I think they are supposed to mean that the donut comes in those colors.</p>

<h2><strong>My opinions</strong></h2>

<p>In my opinion this is a good set and I would recommend it. The amount of minifigs for the price is good. I would like to see more sets like this in the future.</p>

<p>This special set that can only be acquired from Target Department Store in the United States piqued so many interest from the AFOL. Unfortunately, this set is only available from US-Target. Target in other country such as Australia does not carry it which make sizeable number of AFOL disappointed. The author is lucky to be able to get it from his wife relative that is studying in the States. Let us see what this set looks like.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/t/5f61f4f4ea9291754c2f0763/1620484922035/LEGO+40358+minifigure+%282%29.JPG?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>There are 4 minifigures and 1 dalmatian figure in this set. Those minifigures consist of a doctor, a waitress (barista), construction worker and a businessman. The only minifigure with the dual face is the waitress.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/t/5f62baab55101d0ecc4bf2d2/1620484942157/LEGO+40358+set+%281%29.JPG?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px; margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"" /></p>

<p>The physical build itself consists of 5 different elements. The coffee stand, the coffee ads, the round table, rubbish bin and bicycle. Four of the elements are all very simple builds of just attaching several parts together.</p>

<p>Only&nbsp;the coffee stand is a bit more complex than the 4 elements. The coffee stand have a coffee machine as well as rotating table that display a variety of donuts &amp; pie selection.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/t/5f62bb8a84a42938956f7b53/1620484951200/LEGO+40358+set+%282%29.JPG?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>After assembly and being displayed, this set looks attractive and suitable to be combined with LEGO&reg; diorama. Like what you can see from the photos above, you can freely arrange the scene to your liking. This set is similar with the minifigure starter set that usually provided in the LEGO&reg; City theme.</p>

<p>Overall, this set is worth the price for the author. Otherwise, for AFOL people that have a lot of parts, they can just replicate this set. The only problem is they might not be able to easily duplicate the exact minifigures since some minifigure parts are rare. If you noticed, the naming of this set is a pun of the expression &lsquo;Been there done that&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>Building food stall is fun! The city will need more food stall and vendor beside building and vehicle. All those minifigures need a place to eat and drink!</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The number of parts ar sufficient. And we receive quite a number of extra 1x1 printed round tiles.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Both children and adults will enjoy this set. It is complete with 4 minifigures, a dalmatian, food stall and bike!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>The price is right. If you can get discount from Target, it is even better!</p>
