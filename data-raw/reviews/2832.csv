"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-20T21:58:00Z","I WON IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!","It is great! I can't say I've had the same problems as the guys bleow this, but it can still get frusterating. The charicters are: 

* Rosie=Head Chef
* JP= Head Mechanic
* Johnathan Ablebody= You're helper
* Bob Longtree= Head Gardener
* Proffesor Ignius Voltage= Inventor
* Biker Bob= Motorcycleist.

I have own all 10 levels. (Why only 10 levels?) ( I just don't understand)

YOu can build LEGOLAND, Wild West, Castle, and Adventurers themed objects. 1 annoying thing is Johnathan Ablebody won't shut up. He'll even say PATH if you scroll over a path. VVERY annoying, but still worthy of a ten.

P.S.:: Did you read Bring Old SchoolLegos Back review? He called me a menace! I'm just about as menacing as a tuna sandwitch. Oh, and what does &quot;Reaseched the life out of these sets mean? I just play and build them. Not really reserch them, though that might be intrusting...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Paradoxymoron","2008-10-14T20:00:09.983Z","Frustration","I will have to admit that this is a fun game aside from the previously stated point that Jonathon won't shut up and offers much entertainment(if thats what you want to call it) I myself have given up with the game due to a specific SCENARY ISSUE on LEVEL 10! It's as annoying as the third to last level in the Rock Raiders Game were you are slammed with a never-ending barrage of Slimy Slugs! This game however is still fun with some actual LegoLand rides and some that they just made up for the game. There's evena way to build your own LegoLand park without following level guidlines and you can watch videos showing Three of the actual LegoLand parks! This game is cool! Get and don't lose it!(like I apparently did)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Legonater","2008-12-23T22:31:31.7Z","Lego Legoland!","Great Game!
Pros: Four great and well-selected themes.
Challenging Levels is the norm.
Real Legoland rides!
Funny Videos!
Minilands!
Volvo's Driving School!
CONS: Johnothan is never quit. 
The Mechanics are so stupid: They always seem to need direction.
You need to grow a well! 
Washignton level is way too easy.
Anyways, It's fun.I'm only in the Hollan level or just after. The first time I tried to find the money it had litteraly disapeared!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"The_Dumb_One","2011-03-06T19:48:43.35Z","Lot's of fun!","<p>The game is fantastic. Sure, Joe won't shut up but the vast array of possibilities offered&nbsp;in each challenging level make this game amazing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The levels are all challenging, especially towards the end. The sheer amount of ride enables one to divesify one's holdings so you can never get bored.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's also fun to stick the customers in places so that they can't leave the park ;)</p>",TRUE,4,4,5,5,5
