It&rsquo;s a great free gift, but it does have some issues, which we are going to cover in this review.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging &amp; Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Not a lot of things to discuss in all honesty, however we&rsquo;ll go over everything about the above items. Packaged in a loose cardboard holder with images on the front showing the functionality of the set and the back showing all of the warning text and the two different display options for the frame, this is rather easy enough to toss and recycle.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The parts of course are all the same, enough to fit sixteen Minifigures on the frame once built and attached. Nothing unique aside from the 2x2 tile with the LEGO company logo printed on it, which is a very nice piece.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigure</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Using some nice printing and a creative re-use of the rubber ducky hip attachment piece from The LEGO Batman Movie Series 1, we see a very special looking Minifigure to display with the frame. Perhaps a mascot? He has a STUD burger printed on his front torso while the back is plain and unadorned. He features two expressions, wearing funky looking shades and smiling widely, his second expression is curiously designed, I think he&rsquo;s attempting a smolder, an expression comically referred to in Disney&rsquo;s Tangled.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">His hair element is very nicely sculpted and looks fairly impressive. He has dual-molded legs with blue upper parts to represent his shorts. He&rsquo;s off to have fun at the beach.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The Frame &amp; Functionality</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Building the sixteen Minifigure stands is fast and easy. Then you can place your sixteen chosen Minifigures onto the frame (which is simply a large baseplate surrounded by a cardboard frame) and then either hang it on the wall with a nail or unlock the rear display portion to sit the frame on a bookcase or dresser top.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">For what it is, it works great. You can display sixteen of your favorite Minifigures and their accessories, you can swap them around with others, or display the latest series of CMFs before putting them into storage.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The real problem I have with this item is that the clutch power seems a bit weak. It is far too easy to push a Minifigure onto the buildable stand and see the stand completely disconnect from the frame. The clutch power for the feet also weakens over time so you need to occasionally push the figures down onto the stands again, which causes the stands to pop off the frame.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As a free item I can&rsquo;t complain too much, but compared to the solid display cases LEGO also has produced which can fit Minifigures inside of them, I feel this frame is a weaker offering.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Mildly recommended if you want this curiosity for your display, otherwise don&rsquo;t bother trying to track down the entire thing on the secondary market, find and make the Minifigure yourself with parts from your collection if you must have the unique exclusive character included with this item.</p>
