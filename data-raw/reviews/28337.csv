<p>At first glance you would be forgiven for thinking this free set is just a Minifigure and Wheelbarrow, as the main&nbsp;image only&nbsp;has these outlined, but no you get a small recycling section too.</p>

<p><strong>Packet</strong></p>

<p>The packaging on these sets are foil bags.&nbsp; Unlike recent Star Wars ones this still has the folded over top with a really sticky glue keeping it closed.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The Minifigure supplied, <em>Garbageman Gary</em>, uses fairly common parts and alone will probably not sway anyone&#39;s decision to pick this one up.&nbsp; However he will fit nicely in any Lego City due to his commonly used legs/torso&nbsp;and is a welcome addition.</p>

<p><strong>Main Build/Parts</strong></p>

<p>What makes this little set fantastic for &pound;3.85 (and you get a magazine too)&nbsp;is the inclusion of not only Gary, but a Wheelbarrow (nothing new or special) and a simple but very affective recycle/refuse point that you could be forgiven was just part of the background in the image.&nbsp; This is a very simple build as the whole set only has 27 pieces with no spares - as is the norm with this type of packet - and won&#39;t challenge anyone in it&#39;s construction.</p>

<p>What I hadn&#39;t noticed prior to opening was the Bright Blue Box 2x2x2, part (61780), which to date has only appeared in the Technic 42069 set Extreme Adventure, so to get one of those parts in a set like this is a great inclusion.&nbsp; It is worth noting that the blue box appears on the right in the main image but the instructions within the magazine say to put it on the left.&nbsp; Both boxes are on 2x2 jumper plates and easily transferred to however you want them.</p>

<p>The bottle supplied is slightly too big for the box so it stops the lid fully closing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>If you can get this set then do so.&nbsp; It is a perfect little set to add to 4206 Recycling Truck from 2012.&nbsp; If this was released&nbsp;in one of the small &pound;4.99 boxes with an extra bin or&nbsp;Minifigure&nbsp;I could see it doing well.&nbsp; Well done Lego, exactly the type of set that fits the magazine format perfectly.&nbsp;&nbsp;I look forward to the Snowmobile on 5th December.</p>
