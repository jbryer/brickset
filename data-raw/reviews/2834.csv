The gamplay is just ^_^. 10/10!!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-16T20:11:50Z","A MUST HAVE BUY IT","hey gerwin when you said ''er is erts gevonden!!!'' I beleive you meant &quot;your air supply is running out&quot; If that is not what you meant let me know.THis game is a must have it is loads of fun.I have played the game with my brother 3 or 4 times.one of my favorite things to do is to build a Chrome Crusher in the level called &quot;Rock Hard&quot;,the reason for that being that the track is &quot;to small for large mining vehicles&quot;.I wish they used the tunnel transport more and that you could build bridges over water and lava.Tip surround your base with electric fences to protect it from Rock,Ice, and Lava Monsters.Also train and upgrade people before you need the expertise.THe game's only downfalls are that vehicles don't work well with refinerys and the only minifig you can use is Sparks.

  P.S. I would lile to make a mod for Rock Raiders to fix some problem and maybe make it multy player capable.If you have programing or 3D graphics knowledge email me at serving.jesus@gmail.com",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I also like the mode where you can controll rock raiders in first person view.  It gets exciting when rock monsters, ice monsters, and lava monsters attack.  It really stants out from other lego computer games",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Takeshi","2007-08-20T14:20:03.643Z","Just keep drilling, just keep drilling...","Really cool game, my second lego game, The second best game I have ever played. The vehicles are really neat (I have three of them in real life) and the other features keep this game from getting boring fast, if at all. There are only two problems with it. Sometimes the rock raiders don't do what they are supposed to, and you can only get them in one colour. Something that would be really nice would be if they made all of the vehicles and buildings in real life. Excellent game, good for pretty much anybody.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jonbuddy","2008-05-04T10:23:05.78Z","Sweet Game","This game *Rocks*! Get it? Rocks! Anyway, Here are the Goods and Bads:

Good:
Lots of Gameplay Time
The difficulty stands out (in a good way)
Loads of stuff to do

Bad:
Annoying Landslides
Needs Custom Level Builder Option

Overall:
4.8/5
or
9.9/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-22T13:30:08.497Z","WOW, now this is the best game made by LEGO","This is definitely LEGO's finest game, maybe not their most advanced (but they could easily remake it) but definitely their most fun.

I may be a Rock Raiders fan but this is no bais, this is the truth. The game has such a wide play its just awesome.

For starters, it is actually challenging, it is actually fun, and for fans of Homeworld and similar games, this is a must have (I even know people who don't even USE LEGO and they still love this game!).

To summ the game up, I'd have to say 
- the graphics are fine (at the time) but know they are kind of edgy.
- the characters are fun, and the game has a full out vocal system in which any selected option (when &quot;hovered&quot; by the mouse) will be announced. 
- The music is fine
- there IS danger (lava floes, monsters, landslides)
- The sound effects are wonderful
- the game may tend to freeze, but the truth is it's actually your computer
- There are plenty of tools, vehicles, buildings, upgrades, a naming system, dynamite (boom), weapons, defense systems, monsters, rock types, scenarios, levels, and the list goes on. The best part is that any building or vehicle seen can be made using the parts seen in the sets!

What's even better is that the game reacts to what you do, such as drilling, overpopulation (which causes quicker depletion of oxygen), the power is eventually drained from crystals if overused, and too much more!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Speninator","2009-08-12T18:58:01.84Z","This is by far my favorite lego game ever!!","Once you get past the levels that have all that landslides they aren't as annoying.
It actually uses all the vehicles and buildings, you can drive vehicles,and the best part is it gives you a beginning demo for every level.

ps., in the second to last level, back to basics, does any one know how to get slimey slugs out of your base,? and is it true that you need every last energy crystal in that level???

"Paradoxymoron","2009-08-13T09:31:22.187Z","Awesome game","This truely is a great game, though at times it can be a bit difficult and annoying (landslide messages; slimy slugs) But I still think it is Legos most fun game out there.

Pros:
Rock Raiders automatically do stuff without you telling them to
levels are fun
most vehicles from sets included (except Tunnel Transport)
New vehicles and buildings that weren't made into sets
most vehicles are upgradeable
Rock Raiders are upgradeable
Rock Raiders can be trained to do different things

Cons:
Landslide message can be annoying (minor)
Rock Raiders aren't very smart (minor)

I love this game and I'd say, get it if possible

@ Spencer4 I had the same issue with Back to Basics, to deal with the slugs, turn off the power on all your buildins esupport station. if they keep coming, turn that off too, but not for too long. The slugs should go away and you can tunr the power back on.
