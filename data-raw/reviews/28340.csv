"Zett","2018-12-28T05:42:21.6Z","Spider-Man Bike Rescue","<p>This is a 2019 Spider-Man set. It has three minifigs, Spider-Man, Miles Morales Spider-Man, and Carnage. All three of these figures are great, although, I believe they are somewhat of a downgrade from the previous iterations of these figures. The Spider-Man is good, and has a nice look to him, but to be honest I think the Ultimate Spider-Man version looks better, and more like the comic version. This is the same version that comes in the other 4 Spider-Man sets in this wave. The Carnage figure has an okay look to him, but I really prefer the earlier&nbsp;version of Carnage. The Miles Morales Spider-Man really has no major changes, just the color of his hands. His printing has slight changes, but nothing major.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main build of the set is an oversized spider bike. It seems very large, but I understand why they had to make it so large, as it is the main build. What I don&rsquo;t understand is why Spider-Man needs vehicles. That&rsquo;s just not the Spider-Man I know. The other build is a small lab, which is okay. I&rsquo;m sure a young kid would have a lot of fun launching the generators and driving the&nbsp;bike around.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a really good set for the figures, and the builds would be good for a younger kid, but I would recommend passing on this one if you already have the Miles and Carnage figures, because the original&nbsp;figures were better in my opinion, and you can get the new Spider-Man figure in the much better set, Spider-Mech vs Venom.</p>

"BrickSlayersFamily","2018-12-29T21:16:03.427Z","Buy for Miles and updated Spider-Man. ","<p>This is kind of a whatever set. Sometimes you do the worst thing possible, and I think Lego counts on this - you buy a set based on the mini figure. In this case it was Miles Morales. My family loves this character and wanted to pick him up. Carnage is cool and the new deco of Spider-Man is really slick. I didn&#39;t even notice until my boy finished his build.<br />
<br />
Spider-Man needs a motorcycle like Batman needs another helicopter set. The cool lab stuff is always awesome. We add them to all of our super villain contraptions to make a lab of danger! The bike will eventually turn into parts for something else. The could have made a cool catwalk to hover over the set if there was a quota. But this is typically how Lego happens. They need to put out a Spidey set, eventually your going to get an un-needed addition.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I like how the last wave of DC sets fit together, that would be a great angle for some of these small waves. Or tap into the Spider Verse film that came out. You could so a bunch of mini figures, and build a crazy contraption that is fun to build and play&nbsp;with. Give me a larg Kingpin and I will plop down 50 bucks.&nbsp;</p>

"vikings","2020-06-12T06:41:22.533Z","Great Figs, Nice side build, and a Bike. ","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a medium size box. The dimensions of the box are 10.3 x 7.5 x 2.4 inches and weighs 0.75 pounds. You get two instruction booklets in this set. In the first booklet you build the bike and in the second one&nbsp;you build the power generator.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some nice parts in this set. The web pack with all the different web parts was really nice to get instead of the classic rope. The big wheels on the bike are nice to get as they aren&#39;t overly common. You get a mix of red spikes and red flames with Carnage. You get three printed pieces which are three 1x2 yellow and black diangle&nbsp;stripe&nbsp;tiles and 5 stickers; 3 on the power generator and two on the bike. The total piece count for the set is 235. Overall some nice pieces to get.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Spiderman:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>So this is an updated Spiderman and he looks great. His head looks amazing. The new narrower eyes look great. He has the classic webbing all around his head. He has printing on both sides of his torso. On the front you have the classic Spider on the center of his chest. You have a mix of blue and red colors with webbing over all of it. On the back you have a red spider on blue with a few red spots with webbing. He doesn&#39;t have printing on his legs (I do wish that they would have put webbing on them). He has blue legs with red boots which look great. He can have an array of the web pieces to create different looks of him shooting webbing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Miles Morale:</strong></p>

<p>Miles is a great figure to get. His head is black with the red webbing around his white eyes with a silver blue trim. He has printing on both sides of his torso. On the front you have a red V with the red webbing and red spider within it. On the outside of the V you have printing of his abs on the black suit. On the back you some red webbing and a larger red spider. He has plain black legs which is really disappointing. It would have been perfectly happy getting him with black legs with red webbing printing on it, that is all I&#39;m asking for. He like Spiderman can have an array of the new webbing pieces to create different looks of him shooting webs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Carnage:</strong></p>

<p>Carnage is just great. He has a red head with his crazy (Venom like) facial expression with the crazy eyes and angry mouth open. On the back you have black veins showing which is really cool. He has printing on both sides of his torso. On the front you have printing of abs and pecs with a lot of black veins all over. On the back you also have a lot of black veins with some back muscles showing. He has printing on his legs of black veins on his legs and feet. He has a black back plate with four clips where you attach the tentacles (red vines with red cones and black stud with&nbsp;holes and a red spike or flame) The tentacles look amazing and have great playability with Carnage. He has two clear rings with red cones and black stud with holes&nbsp;with a red flame and spike.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was fairly easy and quick to build. You had two separate builds with the bike first (the larger build) and the power generator (the smaller and better build). Both builds have play features on them. The power generator has two web pieces keeping the power generator in tack. There is a catapult feature that launches them up and out showing that Spiderman and Miles Morale couldn&#39;t save it. The bike has a stud shooter that shots a robotic spider and on the other side you have webbing shooting out of it. The back of the bike where Spiderman&#39;s feet go&nbsp;lifts revealing the back wheel. I don&#39;t why they did this it is completely pointless and makes no sense. The build took me less than 30 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a decent set. I am not a fan of getting such a large bike for Spiderman, but it is does look good. The bike has two play features with the stud shooter and back of the bike that lifts up (which was a pointless feature). When you put Spiderman on it with his hands on the handle and legs in the 2x1 black foot plate, he ends up lying face down and can&#39;t see above the handle. The web shooting out of the side is nice but (in my opinion) is a waste of the webbing and would rather have that be able to be used with Spiderman and Miles Morale. The bike itself moves nicely and rolls smoothly. The power generator is great. The design of it is really good with the stickers showing signs of it failing. The two spider webs with skeleton arms on it do a nice job of adding that urgency in trying to hold the generator&#39;s core together. The figures are the best part of set by far. The new version of Spiderman is just great and I love the red boots at the bottom. Getting updated versions of Miles Morale and Carnage are great. I love the tentacles with red flame and spikes. It really adds a great look of him and his name in that he will create&nbsp;carnage with them. The new web pieces are amazing and add cool and unique ways to create different positions/posses for Spiderman and Miles Morale. Overall I highly recommend this set (mainly for the figures) to any Marvel fan/collector. This isn&#39;t a must-have if you aren&#39;t into Marvel&nbsp;and superheroes, but if you do get this it will make a nice addition to your Lego collection (yes, even the bike). Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"EnergyBlast_Productions","2019-07-20T17:02:45.01Z","New Awesome Figures...Same Boring Spider-Man Vehicles","<p>The comic book &quot;Spider-Man&quot; theme that launched as the first line of Marvel sets after the official line of Marvel Super Heroes brought in some new refreshing characters within three new sets. &nbsp;This is the first of those sets, and my expectations here were...more than skeptical.</p>

<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>This set is a bike set, which is really nothing surprising or uncommon these days. &nbsp;Building didn&#39;t take very long, and there were several stickers to apply. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>The first minifgure is the only one which is nonexclusive out of the entire wave - Peter Parker Spider-Man. &nbsp;This new figure is definitely an improvement from the previous Spider-Man figure we got in so many of the Ultimate Spider-Man sets, with some new head and torso printing complimented with dual molded blue legs with red boots. &nbsp;Spidey&#39;s face printing has narrower, sharper eyes than the Ultimate figure, with a blue tint around the outside edges to add some nice detail. &nbsp;The torso printing resembles many iconic Spidey outfits from the comics, and even reminds me of the suit that Peter B. Parker wears in Into the Spider-Verse. &nbsp;Overall it&#39;s a fantastic figure and I&#39;m really glad to have it.</p>

<p>The next figure in this set is Miles Morales Spider-Man, who unlike the other non-Peter Spideys introduced in this wave, actually has already been released as a minifigure before, in a small set from the Ultimate theme. &nbsp;I personally do prefer the Ultimate version just a bit more, as I felt the red stood out better on the torso and head, but this figure isn&#39;t that much worse or anything. &nbsp;Miles&#39;s eyes on his mask have the same blue tint as Peter&#39;s, and the red web lines are printed nicely on the black head piece. &nbsp;Miles&#39;s torso is pretty nice, and he doesn&#39;t have leg printing which is understandable because he&#39;s actually more accurate without it.</p>

<p>The final figure in this set is Carnage, who much like Miles, already had a previous minifigure version in the Ultimate theme - in fact, he was in the same set as Miles back then, too. &nbsp;I sort of have to admit I prefer the Ultimate version over this one as well, mainly for the incredible arm printing that that one had, but this one does introduce some nice orange-ish printing and design over the red. &nbsp;Carnage wears a black apparatus piece with hinges on it (used previously for minifigures like MCU Iron Spider and Outriders from Infinity War) and it&#39;s used to attach four long red tenticles with different pieces on the ends. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>The one part of the build besides the bike is a small Roxxon&nbsp;power generator with hologram stickers on either side of the container. &nbsp;There are some nice yellow and black warning tiles on the floor of the generator, and the main play feature of the build is to hit a piece that launches the two power sources into the air, supposedly resembling Carnage breaking into the generator and busting it open.</p>

<p>The bike is of course the main part of the set and it&#39;s really not much more than I expected. &nbsp;Oversized bikes is something that really only works in certain themes like Ninjago or even Nexo Knights but personally I really don&#39;t think it works in Super Heroes sets, especially when there&#39;s no canon appearance to base it off of. The bike has a bright red and blue color scheme, as do all of Spider-Man&#39;s vehicles in this wave, and it features a pretty simple yet decently sleek design with some slopes in the front and back. &nbsp;The tires are large and one thing I found odd was how they suggested to place Spidey on the bike in the first place. &nbsp;He basically has to be facing belly-down with his legs loosely connected to one piece with his hands holding the handlebars. &nbsp;It&#39;s kinda weird, but then again finding a way to make minifigure-scaled Spider-Man look natural on such a huge bike is pretty difficult already.</p>

<p>The bike&#39;s main play features are stud shooters modified with web pieces to resemble the bike firing webs at Carnage, which works well enough, I suppose.</p>

<p>Additionally in this set are a full set of web accesorries for your Spider-Man minifigures (some are already used for the bike) as well as two small metal spider pieces with a blue stud attached. &nbsp;I believe they are carried over from the last wave of Nexo Knights sets from 2018, but there still an interesting piece all the same.</p>

<h2>The Price</h2>

<p>This set retails for $19.99 in US dollars, which I think is definitely a fair price for the amount of pieces and the size of the builds. &nbsp;You get a pretty solid minifigure selection here, which is honestly pretty good compared to other sets at this price point.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall, this set is good, but the main draw-in is definitely the minifigures. &nbsp;The Roxxon power generator is a nice side build and could easily be incorporated in MOCs and other setups, but the bike is pretty standard Spider-Man vehicle stuff, which I know many people are tired of at this point. &nbsp;I would recommend picking this up especially for the figures, but it really depends on whether the builds will be something you care about or not.</p>

I had been looking to buy 76036 just for the carnage and miles morales figure. just like that, there&#39;s updated versions of them! Now lets get into the set. Sorry about the pictures, I couldn&#39;t really figure that out.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The box is fine, illustrates the play features well and keeps a comic book aesthetic</p>

<p>https://ibb.co/GHMXqDZ<br />
https://ibb.co/KD7G0Nq</p>

<p>The build</p>

<p>building it is a very enjoyable experience, the cycle uses some very interesting techniques and its satisfying to see how it all goes together. There&#39;s quite a few stickers compared to other sets but its fine. the build comes with interesting color pieces with a lot of turquoise and translucent blue. as well as printed hazard tiles.</p>

<p>https://ibb.co/hXGBrHZ&nbsp;</p>

<p>The play features</p>

<p>The bike comes with a stud shooter that shoots these little molded spider bomb things, the reactor explodes but doesn&#39;t send anything very far.</p>

<p>The Minifigures</p>

<p>the best part about this set. A redesigned Spiderman after everyone got sick of the old one being used to death is great! I only had the realistic civil war one but this is easily better! dual molded legs and shining eyes, nice! Miles Morales is very similar to his last incarnation, but I&#39;m just glad to have him even if it&#39;s just a printed torso and head. Carnage is awesome, with a jack o lantern type head and massive tentacles to use, he is easy to pose staying above the ground and climbing without his feet touching the ground! Spidey and Miles come with an array of webs to shoot from their hands and a pair of web-handcuff for carnage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>https://ibb.co/Sc9fbGW</p>

<p>Overall I would recommend this set for Marvel fans or people trying to get into it. The parts that come with the set make for fun MOC&acute;s and its very cheap for its value. I have never been a huge fan of all the Spiderman vehicles, they look like something from juniors set, and I&#39;ve always said he just needs buildings and hideouts to swing around. This set has made a balance. The motorcycle has a great design (besides the big web pole thing sticking out, i just remove that) and a power generator to interact with that provide a plot. I am very glad I bought this set instead of a Mandalorian battle pack!</p>

"ELDASPOXD666","2020-05-24T23:19:28.177Z","Oversized bikes are cool, but that doesn't mean Spider-Man should have one","<p>I was looking at some of the most recent reviews, and I found a review about this set which was written by covfefe2020, and because I own this set, it inspired me to give my opinion on it, too. So today I&#39;ll be reviewing the most recent addition to my LEGO collection: Spider-Man Bike Rescue!</p>

<h2>Backstory:</h2>

<p>I got it this year as a birthday gift from one of my friends, and since then, it has been sitting on my desk until now. That&#39;s it, I don&#39;t have an emotional backstory or a meaningful connection with this set, unlike other sets I&#39;ve reviewed in the past.</p>

<h2>Build:</h2>

<p>The build is good, it includes Spider-Man&#39;s bike, and a power generator. The bike follows the trend of oversized bikes that started with Agents in 2008 and became more common thanks to Ninjago, and it has one of the best builds I&#39;ve seen in an oversized bike. The only problem I have with it is the same problem I have with every single set that includes a vehicle for Spider-Man: SPIDER-MAN SHOULDN&#39;T HAVE A VEHICLE!!! I seriously don&#39;t get why LEGO loves making vehicles for Spider-Man considering that he never used any vehicles in almost every single piece of Spider-Man media (in the Spider-Man PS4 game he even states that he doesn&#39;t have a driving license because he prefers using his webs to swing around the city), so what&#39;s the point of giving him so many vehicles? What&#39;s even worse is that the bike is supposed to be the main build of this set, which prevents the other build from standing out. If this bike belonged to any other character that isn&#39;t Spider-Man (or any other character who has been portrayed as not having any vehicles), I&#39;d be completely fine with it.</p>

<p>Ok, now that I&#39;ve finished dissing Spidey&#39;s bike, let&#39;s move on to the other build included in this set: The power generator. I think this build makes WAY more sense than the bike, and it even works perfectly to build the setting, which I think is supposed to be a power plant. To be honest, I wished this set was more focused on the power plant part rather than the bike part (but I guess that if this set was more focused on that part, it wouldn&#39;t be called&nbsp;Spider-Man Bike Rescue in the first place). The build is pretty detailed, and very accurate to what an industrial power generator would probably look like in real life (I don&#39;t exactly know how that kind of power generators looks like).</p>

<p>This set doesn&#39;t have many play features, it only includes a stud shooter for the bike that shoots spider-shaped robots (or bombs, I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re supposed to be), and an exploding function for the power generator that launches its power cells upwards. And even though this isn&#39;t a play feature, this set also comes with some web blast effect pieces, which are awesome for displaying minifigures in fight scenes, just like regular blast effect pieces.</p>

<h2>Minifigures:</h2>

<p>In my opinion, the minifigures are the best part of this set: It includes a new version of Spider-Man made in 2019 (and still being used for the 2020 Spider-Man sets) that is based off the Spider-Armor MK IV featured in The Amazing Spider-Man Vol 4 #1 (I learned about the existence of that suit thanks to the PS4 game, and then I made some research about it on Google, I&#39;ve actually never read that comic), an updated version of Miles Morales that has black hands instead of red hands like his 2015 version, and an updated version of Carnage that has completely different prints compared to his 2015 version, and a bunch of tentacles that are bigger than his original tentacles (which used the vine piece in red). Out of all the minifigures included in this set, Carnage is the best in my opinion. This version of the character is clearly an improvement over the 2015 Carnage minifigure, because this one has a more detailed print (though he doesn&#39;t have arm printing this time), and the tentacles feel more natural and intimidating because of how they&#39;re built.</p>

<h2>Price:</h2>

<p>Objectively, the $20 is fine considering this set has 235 pieces. Too bad most of those pieces are used to build that damn bike.</p>

<h2>Extra:</h2>

<p>This set doesn&#39;t have any features that don&#39;t belong to any of the previous categories, so I won&#39;t write anything in the extra section this time.</p>

<h2>Overall opinion:</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this set has an amazing minifigure selection and decent builds. I only wished that the bike wasn&#39;t there in the first place (or at least that it wasn&#39;t the main part of this set) because it overshadows the rest of the set. I would only recommend buying this set for the minifigures, as it&#39;s the only redeemable part. In fact, I think the reason for why LEGO includes these awesome minifigures not only in this set, but in every other 2019-2020 Spider-Man set is because LEGO knows that no matter how bad these sets are, people are still gonna buy them for the minifigures (specially considering the fact that a lot of the 2019-2020 Spider-Man sets include characters from Into The Spider-Verse, and the fact that we never had sets based on that movie).</p>
