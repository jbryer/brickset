<p>Bastion is immediately recognizable in his robot form and looks great.&nbsp; His Omnic Crisis color scheme looks fantastic and I love that they went with this skin over the default.&nbsp; This skin also happens to be my favorite Bastion skin and it&#39;s what I run when I play the game, so I may be slightly biased there.&nbsp; He&#39;s quite posable, with ball joints at his head, shoulders, hips, and ankles, and hinges at his elbows and non-rifle wrist.&nbsp; His knees, unfortunately, are completely fixed--more on that later...&nbsp; He also has a few other assorted joints at his cannon, heels, and shoulder panels.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>He comes with a small display stand with a Blizzard name plate attached to it as well as his bird friend, Ganymede.&nbsp; The stand is a nice touch collectors will appreciate, and hopefully it means there will be more display models (and not just the minifigs we already know about) on the way.&nbsp; His rifle arm has a stud-shooter mounted and comes with a few yellow 1x1 rounds to fire.&nbsp; Bastion&#39;s bird friend, Ganymede, is slightly crude but still quite recognizable as a bird (in this case, a cardinal), which is pretty amazing at this scale considering he <em>is</em> piece-built.&nbsp; He&#39;s shown perched on Bastion&#39;s shoulder, but thanks to the excellent articulation, it&#39;s easy to pose Bastion holding him up to his face while perched on his hand to have a conversation.&nbsp; Including Ganymede lends a splash of color as well as personality, and softens the character of what&#39;s otherwise, let&#39;s face it, a killer robot with a huge gun.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s no way around this--Bastion is hugely overpriced.&nbsp; This being a licensed set, I expected to pay more than the typical $0.10/pc, but this set has no custom printed pieces, and no collectible/exclusive minifigs--and without the benefit of free shipping, VIP points, or freebee throw-ins (the model is not available from Lego, only Blizzard), this little 182 piece set came to a painful $33 shipped.&nbsp; I understand, it&#39;s an exclusive set made for a niche market, but for that much, it would have been nice to have 20 or so more pieces to give the knees hinges and make him more transformable...</p>

<p><strong>Transformability</strong></p>

<p>So speaking of being transformable, he&#39;s not.&nbsp; At least, not in the usual sense...&nbsp; You can flip him around backwards and pull his canon down, but it&#39;s not very close at all to what he looks like in game as a turret, to say nothing of tank mode.&nbsp; Now if this weren&#39;t Lego, the story would end there.&nbsp; What&#39;s keeping him from being transformable?&nbsp; I&#39;d say, at minimum, he needs:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hinges in the knees</li>
	<li>Collapsible head</li>
	<li>Collapsible rifle</li>
	<li>More versatile shoulders/shoulder panels</li>
	<li>Better joint on the gatling gun/cannon</li>
	<li>Tank treads</li>
</ul>

<p>Now there are a lot of parts in this set.&nbsp; The legs are a full five plates thick and the arms each have two hinges.&nbsp; We also have the usual assortment of spare parts.&nbsp; It&#39;s almost like Lego <em>wants</em><em> </em>us to redesign him into his other two modes--or even, possibly, something that transforms properly.&nbsp; I&#39;ve only taken the first steps toward this (hey, I&#39;ve only had him for 24 hrs as of this writing!), but what I have found is:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The 2x2 round on the gun barrel comes right off to reveal a <em>very</em> close replica of the cannon from his tank mode.</li>
	<li>The shoulders <em>almost</em> fold up in such a way that you can create both the armor shields for turret mode as well as the ammo cannisters in tank mode.</li>
	<li>The head can be pulled off the stem used for his neck and then placed back on same stem through the back instead of the bottom, leaving it in a flattened position.</li>
	<li>The elbow joints on the cannon can be flipped around allowing it to swing into a much better position for a potential gun mode.&nbsp; The cost of this is having the gun sit slightly farther off Bastion&#39;s back in robot mode.</li>
	<li>The faceted tiles (four on each leg) look suspiciously like tank treads, and the double-set of 1x4 offset plates on the toes look like they&#39;d make great wheels for a tank mode...</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, Bastion is <em>begging</em> to be reconfigured.&nbsp; So while some might complain that he should be transformable, I would instead say this is Lego at its best--showing you the possibility, giving you the pieces you need, and leaving you to your imagination to make it happen.&nbsp; I haven&#39;t played--I mean really <em>played</em>--with a Lego set like this in a long time.&nbsp; With any luck, I hope to be editing this review and perhaps adding photos of the results of my further tinkering.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I love that this model even exists at all.&nbsp; There are lots of Lego fans and lots of Overwatch players, but I&#39;m not sure just how much of an intersection there is between those two groups, and yet Lego took the risk to produce this set.&nbsp; It&#39;s totally overpriced... but we&#39;re talking $33 shipped vs. $23.&nbsp; It&#39;s a great little set and given its niche and exclusive nature, $10 isn&#39;t that much of a premium.&nbsp; I&#39;m glad I purchased it and I love that his one glaring flaw, to my surprise, turned out to be the inspiration to be a kid again and enjoy Lego as it was meant to be.&nbsp; This is the first model in a long time that&#39;s been more than just a build it and put it on display experience, and I love that.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say I&#39;ll be buying tons of Overwatch sets, but Bastion here has shown me that the collaboration between Blizzard and Lego is definitely something to pay close attention to.&nbsp; I&#39;m looking forward to seeing what else they can come up with together (ahem, <em>D.Va mech, anyone??</em>).</p>

<p>Until then... <em>Bweep, bwoop-beep!</em></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s been a few weeks now and the most obvious thing that&#39;s happened since this review is the release of #75974 Bastion.&nbsp; The new Bastion is a little more expensive and a <em>lot</em> better of a model.&nbsp; Converting this model into something transformable is now, sadly, rather pointless.&nbsp; So I won&#39;t bother posting pictures, but I was able to modify the legs to have knee joints and reversed the hinges on his shoulders allowing the arms to fold better for turret mode (at a cost of them not quite laying flat in bot mode).</p>

<p>These two changes, along with quickly removing and replacing the head and shoulder panels in &quot;partsformer&quot; fashion (to borrow a term from the Transformers fandom) made him into a pretty decent, transformable model in both bot and turret modes.&nbsp; I don&#39;t doubt I could make a pretty good looking tank mode out of the parts on hand, but that would involve a complete tear down of his legs and lower torso and would not be remotely transformable.&nbsp; Even in the actual game, Bastion&#39;s treads basically come out of nowhere during his transformation so no real surprise there.</p>

<p>Given the existence of the newer, bigger Bastion, I&#39;ve reduced the &quot;value for money&quot; score from 3 to 1.&nbsp; It&#39;s really closer to 1.5 since he&#39;s still a decent model, but I just can&#39;t forgive how quickly another, far superior Bastion was released before this one had even barely left my hands.&nbsp; On the bright side, we <em>are</em> getting a D.va mech I&#39;d wished for, and it looks fantastic, so there&#39;s that.</p>
