"GreenGirl","2019-04-01T05:31:37.983Z","Great Display Set","<p>This is first set of LEGO I&rsquo;ve purchased (after smashing wrist to smithereens my sister started sending me Brickheadz sets to help me rehabilitate&nbsp;mechanics of my fingers and now I&rsquo;m buying LEGO sets and writing reviews).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Im new to LEGO at 59. I was attracted to this set because it stands on its own in bookcase looking like all the books in case &nbsp;or when openen on display.&nbsp;It was fun to build. I was worried it would be complicated but it isn&rsquo;t.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ive made the third build designer v generously posted online after doing the 2 builds purchased w set. I made latch designer suggested and put name plates on spine also suggested by designer. (He further modified his set but those were the only 2 suggestions my current skill set could easily accommodate for.)</p>

<p>It has 4 mini figs and 2 nanofigs&nbsp;I think they are called. I think the 3 builds are v clever &nbsp;the instruction booklet was v interesting providing information on genesis of pop up books. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Im looking forward to switching up the builds. I keep it on my living room table. I think it&rsquo;s beautiful. My friends are v surprised by it. I highly recommend this as a gift.&nbsp;</p>

<br />
LEGO Ideas has been a lifeline for many AFOLs over the past few years considering the ongoing absence of historically cherished themes (i.e. Castle, Pirates, Classic Space, and more). 21315-1 Pop-Up Book represents another unique entry into the Ideas&nbsp;theme, with throwback references to classic fantasy and fairy tales. I&#39;ll run through the pro&#39;s/con&#39;s list then wrap it up with a conclusion.<br />
<br />
<strong>Pros:</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Unique &quot;pop-up&quot; concept:</strong>&nbsp;The set is styled as a book which fully opens up to reveal the scene on the interior. Apart from being a clever bit of LEGO engineering, I like this for two reasons: it implements a function within the set and keeps the &quot;play&quot; aspect of the set confined to the interior-leaving&nbsp;the exterior as a great display piece. Secondly, should you so desire, the inside play scene can be removed and this book acts as a nice &quot;hidden storage&quot; place for some of your favorite LEGO items- or even your house keys! This isn&#39;t something I&#39;ve explored yet but the fact that this set could serve alternate functions is really neat.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Multiple &quot;play&quot; scenes:</strong> Two fairy tales- Little Red Riding Hood and Jack and the Beanstock are represented here. The set could have passed with just one interior, but the fact we are given two separate fairy tales to build and swap out is a nice bonus, and adds to the playability AND display potential of the set.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Source of excellent parts:</strong>&nbsp;If you aren&#39;t fussy about building the actual set, and are in the market for increasing your parts catalog, look no further. The inclusion of dark green bricks and brown tile make for a great, rare source of parts for MOCing. Dark green brick is excellent for making swamps/bog water using the SNOT technique, and brown tiles are welcome in a variety of medieval building techniques. If you&#39;re able to grab a second copy of this set at a discount, it is highly recommended.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Ability to enclose&nbsp;minifigs:</strong> I&#39;ve ran into a little trouble with closing the lid entirely while&nbsp;trying to include the minifigs. The set may not be designed to do so, but be careful to not damage the elements, especially the grandmother wolf. The lid CAN close with the figures from this scene but requires some juggling</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Price point:</strong> It seems like a broken record, but $79.99 Canadian dollars is the current price for this set. I think that it&#39;s a bit high but others may disagree. This set shouldn&#39;t be too hard to find at a discount so I would recommend pursuing this option rather than paying full price.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The Lego Ideas line exists&nbsp;to put out unique entries into the market and&nbsp;21315-1 Pop-Up Book continues this trend. The platform lends itself to ideas and set designs inspired by AFOLs the world over. This set in particular combines function, display, and playability in one. While the inserted scenes may become old quick, the great part about LEGO is the ability to design your own story. The Pop-Up book should inspire AFOLs to MOC and create their own fairy tale scenes to be inserted inside the pop-up book. This entry may not grab the accolades in the way the Saturn V or Old Fishing Store did, but that doesn&#39;t mean it isn&#39;t a solid set in its own right. For those reasons, it comes recommended (especially if you can grab it at a discount).&nbsp;</p>

"indykid","2020-06-18T02:13:16.273Z","Got this on sale","<p>This was on sale on Amazon a while back and I decided to buy it on a whim. I hadn&#39;t bought LEGOs in years and had been gifted them only intermittently since I started high school mostly for display pieces. I was curious about the pop up action and I&#39;d been thinking about getting back into LEGOs for a few years so I figured I&#39;d go for it.</p>

<p>This was a super fun way to get back into it. Building the book would be tedious for someone who had been buying LEGOs more regularly but I had a lot of fun with it since it had been so long. I got stuck at one point after making a mistake and had to go back a few steps but I admit I was rusty. The detail of the brown tiles on the exterior and the flowers on the interior corners reminded me of the hardcover picture books and fairy tales from childhood so mission accomplished by the designers!</p>

<p>The Little Red Riding Hood insert is pretty great and has some nice details with Grandma&#39;s kitchen table (and a bed that she fits inside not just sits on top of!) Building the house facade was filled with nice details and I still didn&#39;t know how the pop up conceit was going to work right up until I attached the house to the book which was thrilling. My few qualms are that the way the bottom of the house is designed it slides around a bit and tips forward on account of the rounded pieces on the bottom and when you fold the book you can&#39;t do it if the minifigs are inside. Still a lot of great playability and the wolf head is super cool!</p>

<p>The Jack and the Beanstalk insert was clearly the more display oriented design. Jack is one of those tiny statue ultra minifigs while the giant is a regular minifig. The town and the beanstalk and tower are all micro scale which looks neat and there&#39;s a very clever use of string to keep the beanstalk upright when the book is opened. The lack of playability for this story is only a fault based on preference. Personally I like that they split the difference with the two stories, and also how would they even fit a giant minifig into the regular sized book? The insert has the same sliding/tipping quality of the LRRH insert which is only a minor flaw.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;d recommend this set more to an adult or perhaps an adult with kids. Adults can enjoy the build and the display of the beanstalk and then play with their kids by recreating Little Red Riding Hood. Overall excellently designed and glad I got it on sale!</p>

"DearMisterLegoBreaker","2020-05-25T19:25:24.083Z","Not very good compared to many other Ideas sets","<p>Ok I will make it short.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building the book is boring.</p>

<p>There is a huge part&nbsp;almost only stacking dark green bricks. And another one building the pages. And that&#39;s it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building the scene is fun. But then you notice you can&#39;t put the minifigures in the book.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So the whole effect, the main reason this set exists,&nbsp;falls appart.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I really was disappointed by this set. Especially since I paid it full price and got a damaged box in a Lego Store (without any sort of discount).&nbsp;</p>
