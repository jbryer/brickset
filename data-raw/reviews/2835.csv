You can walk around as Jet, Sparks, Axle, Docs, and Bandit.  There are several intresring items and creatures.  There is a new consept of red energy cristals and there are lost rock raiders you have to find and rescue.    ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Paradoxymoron","2009-10-27T20:21:34.013Z","Completely different from Computer version","As teh title says, this is nothing like the computer version. Here's a list of similarites and differences:

Similarities:
Openning videos and other videos are the same.

Differences:
You actually play as Sparks, Jet, Axle, Docs, and Bandit
You can fly the Tunnel Transport
Lava can be cooled off by water
Slimy Slugs that can.... well.... move extremely fast....
Rock/ Ice Monsters are huge
New Red energy crystals= 5 times more energy than green ones
Giant Spiders
Scorpions
Rock Whales (They are not actually aquatic, they look more like a six-legged cross between an elephant and.... well a fish...)
You can actually use the lasr/pusher/freezer beam
And there's more, but.... Time for Pros/cons

Pros:
Great game
can play as Docs and Company
Can control vehicles
Ore isn't entirely important
Very Fun

Cons:
Vehicles can be difficult to drive (More than once I've driven one into lava or been trampled by a rampaging Rock Whale)

I encourage all Rock Raiders fans to get this game in some way or another, because it's just amazing. If you like to buy and play Lego's video games, I'd suggest getting this next if you haven't gotten it already.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
