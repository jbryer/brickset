My cousin and I have at least 10 custom tracks all that we've mastered. It's great when you finally beat the champion of the world: Mr.X!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

1. It's too slow
2. It's only compatible with Windows 95 &amp; 98.

Recently after I bought this, our computer updated to Windows XP and I couldn't play and that was a big bad problem that I couldn't fix. :D",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

One this that is a little wierd to get used to is the stearing.  You dont actually STEAR your car!   well kinda...  It stears for you,  however you will spin out if your going too fast so you need to have a good sence of when to speed up, and when to slow down.

+u can biuld tracks!
-u cant biuld minifigs...

i STILL give it a 5/5!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only reason this game gets 3/5 is because of the creator where you can have fun messing up the A.I.</p>",TRUE,3,1,5,1,2
