The Spider-Car, as ridiculous and unnecessary as it is, does contain a few interesting parts, particularly the printed hood and the pieces over the wheels. Green Goblin&#39;s glider, on the other hand, doesn&#39;t really have any redeeming factors and is inferior to past versions. His pumpkin bomb is also unprinted, which is disappointing as his last two appearances included a printed jack-o-lantern face. More webbing for Spidey is also included, which is always welcome.</p>

<p>As I said, the star of the show is the minifigures, so here we go. After using the same design from Ultimate Spider-Man since 2012, occasionally interrupted by MCU suits, Spider-Man finally gets a long overdue and fantastic looking redesign this year, although he unfortunately lacks dual molded legs in both of the 4+ sets in this wave. Green Goblin also looks great, and is my favorite Lego rendition of him to date.</p>

<p>All in all, this set isn&#39;t really anything special, but if you need to add Spider-Man or Green Goblin to your collection, you can&#39;t go wrong here.</p>

<p>This set includes two Minifigures; Spider man and green goblin, green goblin&#39;s speeder, and spider-man&#39;s car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigures&nbsp;are have the 4+ printing so they look a little bit more like a kids toy than an adults collectable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Green goblin&#39;s speeder is very tiny and can hold Green Goblin with pretty much no extra room.</p>

<p>Spider-man&#39;s car is about four inches long and is a very easy build. It has a seat for Spider-man and can drive when pushed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall i think this set is fun but i do not know if it is worth full retail for what it is. I think that any Marvel, Spider-man or 4+ collector should get this set.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-23T10:50:59.027Z","A Juniors Disappointment.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #76133 Spider-Man Car Chase:</b> Welcome to a Marvel Super Heroes 4+ set which once again is now where you&rsquo;ll find the LEGO Juniors sets. This Spider-Man set is a quick and easy build and features some nice Minifigures. But is it worth picking up? Well, let&rsquo;s discuss the set and you can decide for yourself.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The box for this set has Spidey in the top corner and the colour seems to be similar to the DC 4+ set, it&rsquo;s a little darker compared to the Endgame sets from this year. The manual works well for what it is too and is easy to follow along with to build the models. A decent look for the packaging of this set at least.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There&rsquo;s the single piece Car chassis again, but not a whole lot of elements in the set, though there is a printed spider logo sloped element.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Green Goblin: This character is in a lot of Spider-Man sets, but most of them have been LEGO Juniors. Using the parts you&rsquo;d expect, a dual-sided torso with his traditional Goblin costume print, the CMF Goblin head piece with the pointed ears and a dual-sided facial print with cackling mad and completely enraged. He has printing on his legs, but this character could have benefited from dual-molded legs for the green knees.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Spider-Man: This Minifigure has been in a lot of sets, granted the print details change over time, the spider on his chest here is a bit different looking from other versions of the costume. If you&rsquo;ve seen one Spidey Minifigure, you&rsquo;ve seen them all.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build &amp; completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is a quick build, in fact compared to the Batman 4+ set of the same price range I found this build to be even less engaging and quicker compared to the other one. The car isn&rsquo;t as interesting either, but maybe that&rsquo;s because traditionally Spider-Man doesn&rsquo;t have a huge fleet of vehicles. Although in the history of the comics he did have something at some point in his life.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Goblin Glider is pretty interesting, it includes a clip to hold the bag Goblin has stolen from a local bank.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I got this set because I&rsquo;ve missed out on the Green Goblin a lot, and wanted that Minifigure for my collection. So that&rsquo;s what attracted me to this set, for a 4+ set it&rsquo;s serviceable, but I think some of the Juniors sets have had better models and ideas. The Jurassic World sets even had more to do and enjoy with them compared to these two sets, but I did appreciate the Batman set more. I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend this for AFOLs, but for the targeted age range, it might be fun for a little while.</p>
