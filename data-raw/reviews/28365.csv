<p>The biggest draw for me for this set is the helmet for Cap. It&#39;s a welcome addition to the character, it possibly a little to late. The quality of the print on Cap&#39;s head, in my opinion, is a bit poor as the dark blue from the head shows slightly as his face seems paler than the light flesh coloured&nbsp;head that has been used previously.&nbsp;The torso for Cap, is unfortunately identical to all of the other Avengers in this line, and lacks any arm printing of which would have been nice. The printing on the legs line up nicely with the torso. His shield is, in my opinion, closer to that of the source material, as it is printed on to a dark grey piece, rather than the red piece that has been used in the past. If you look at the back of the shield in the films, it isn&#39;t red, it has a brushed metal finish. The printing on the shield is better than that of the previous shields, with the white being white rather than a very pale pink.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was nice to get a variant of the outriders, however I would have rather had one and an additional character, especially since the outriders are in another 3 of the endgame sets. The outrider design is identical to that used with Infinity war&#39;s sets. The difference is it the arms and the claws. The additional arms/claws&nbsp;for the 6 arm variant seem to bulky and awkward in my opinion. I feel that the arms should have been the same as the ones used last year as they would still be able to hold the claws, but it would open the figure up a bit more, as the way the claws are held in currently kind of closes the figure up.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Like all built bikes for minifigures, this one is overly large. The disc shooters make the bike bulkier than it needs to be, but I do understand that this is so it has some playability.&nbsp;If the bike was modified and the disc shooters were removed, I do believe that the&nbsp;resultant bike would be rather nice and would match the bike we&#39;ve seen Cap ride in Winter Soldier and Age of Ultron. The bike includes a kick stand, of which I thought was a nice edition. The integration of the trans-orange action pieces was done well and work well to look like a bullet has been fired. The guns on the model seem, again, to big for Cap. The only time we have seen Cap use a gun it was a small pistol, not a gun that stands as tall as he does. I feel these guns would work better with Rocket Raccoon.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Overall it was a ok set and was easy to build and would be great for the younger builders that the set was aimed at, but if you are an AFOL and are after a set to challenge you, this isn&#39;t the set for you. The pieces in it I&#39;ve seen before and as far as I&#39;m aware, doesn&#39;t contain any exclusive coloured pieces. If you&#39;re not bothered about the build,&nbsp;building an army of outriders, or owning all of the Marvel sets then I&#39;d give the set a miss and buy Cap&nbsp;separately.&nbsp;</p>

"rypo2020","2019-06-05T07:17:43.293Z","GREATEST SET OF 2019. Iâ€™m totally, absolutely, definitely not being sarcastic ","<p><strong>ENDGAME SPOILERS AHEAD</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately I was being sarcastic in the title and this set is not great but still has some redeeming qualities. Avengers Endgame is possibly the greatest movie ever and it has the potential for amazing sets too, but most of the sets released for it have nothing to do with it except the minifigures included and the&nbsp;Avengers Compound set and the Quinjet&nbsp;(which Black Widow takes to Tokyo). I do totally understand that Endgame was kept extremely secret to prevent spoilers, so Lego didn&#39;t have much to work with and it is definitely not their fault, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that this set is an humongous motorcycle&nbsp;shooting&nbsp;flames and Avengers logos and was never seen in an MCU movie.</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGURES</strong></p>

<p><em>Captain America, aka Steve Rogers,&nbsp;</em>is easily the best part about this set as he comes with a new shield and helmet. Cap comes with the Quantum Realm suits that the team of heroes uses to time travel, and I have to say that it gets repetitive as it is in most of the so-called Endgame sets, but it is an incredible print that is quite accurate, featuring the Avengers Logo, so I don&#39;t hate it at all. I think the Avengers look awesome when they wear matching suits and they&#39;re good for display. Steve has a new helmet mold and a head print designed to work with the helmet. I love the new helmet and I just wish we could&#39;ve had this earlier on because this is most likely Steve Rogers&#39;&nbsp;last Lego minifigure. The helmet features the &quot;A&quot; and the feather things on the sides. The facial expressions are a serious fighting scowl and a grin, both of which appear kind of pasty on the head, but it isn&#39;t that noticeable when he has a helmet on.&nbsp;The new shield is great though! It is a gray piece instead of a red piece, so it looks much more accurate.&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>Three Outriders&nbsp;</i>are included, and these are still good, but not that special. They are identical prints to last year&#39;s Outriders, but they have different arm arrangements. One of them has 2 arms with golden claws and a spiky shoulder pad. The other two have 6 arms that are much more bulky than Infinity War&#39;s Outriders. These are good to get for army building, but not that exciting.</p>

<p><strong>The Huge, Fire-shooting Motorcycle</strong></p>

<p>I established that this isn&#39;t in Endgame in the introduction, so I&#39;m gonna focus on the physical Lego build. The motorcycle doesn&#39;t look bad by itself, and I think it is pretty cool. It has disk shooters that can shoot Avengers logos at the Outriders. The set comes withe a set of orange&nbsp;superhero energy bursts, which I absolutely could never get enough of as the are incredibly useful for setting up battle displays and MOCs. These are attached to some cannons which are detachable so Cap can use them without the bike. The oversized bike rolls just fine which is great for play. The bike has a kick-stand so it won&#39;t tip over, and it has a seat for one minifigure and a clip for an accessory. When Captain America rides on it the bike looks absolutely humongous and kind of ridiculous, but I&#39;m guessing kids won&#39;t mind as it is easier to grab and play with.</p>

<p><strong>Final Opinion</strong></p>

<p>This set is a good toy, which is the goal with most Lego sets as they are toys and kids will definitely enjoy this one. I think this set isn&#39;t very good for TFOLs and AFOLs, because we are usually after accuracy and awesome minifigures, neither of which are in this set. Unfortunately this set isn&#39;t ever really seen in any of 22 MCU films (unless you say that this is Cap&#39;s AOU bike, but I think it is to different from that). The price of $20 dollars is steep, but if you can get it at 20% off, and you want Captain America for his new pieces, then go for it. The outrider are like Stormtroopers in that you can never have enough of them. Some of the parts are cool and useful for other things also, especially the energy bursts.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my review of Lego Marvel&#39;s Avengers 76123: Captain America: Outriders Attack.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-29T13:16:08.37Z","Endgame in LEGO was really different than the movie.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #76123 Captain America: Outriders Attack:</b> Avengers Endgame was one of the biggest movie productions in history and the penultimate outcome of ten years of movie storylines. The LEGO Endgame sets attempted to incorporate events from the film while also paying homage to the ten years of previous films, all without spoiling what actually happens in the movie. Which means a fair number of sets were locations and vehicles that didn&rsquo;t actually show up on screen.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">With Marvel Super Heroes sets starting in 2019 Packaging design finally changed from the original red colour on the shelf to shift into a more uniform look for each character or set of characters from a given Marvel Comic series.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">For the Avengers Endgame sets we got all white packaging with a nice shot of the Avengers on the front panel, the live actors stylized, but on the side of each package is a recreation of the characters in the live action shot in LEGO Minifigure animated form.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The set is shown off very nicely on the front in a decent action scene. The back showcases the features, as always, and this design aesthetic carries over into the manual.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">An all-white manual, the instructions for the build are fairly simple enough to follow along with. The design of the packaging and manual combined evokes the uniform white outfits that everybody is wearing and it&rsquo;s a nice change compared to the older red boxes.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Not a whole lot to discuss here, considering the price range this particular set includes the new Energy Elements in red to represent flames and some printed Avengers logo discs for the disc shooters, but not a whole lot more. The price one pays when picking up yet another Motorcycle inspired set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Captain America: The biggest draw of this set is Cap in his white Quantum Realm traveling suit. The printing detail on this figure is superb, with a little Avengers Logo on his chest and all of the armor detailing. His shield hasn&rsquo;t changed, except this one is cast in dark grey plastic with red, white and blue printing on it instead of being made out of red plastic with minor printing on the front to add the logo.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Cap is wearing a new helmet piece, I can&rsquo;t recall if he&rsquo;s worn it before. Most previous Captain America&rsquo;s I&rsquo;ve gotten were just printed Minifigure heads with no head gear, but whenever this new sculpt was introduced it adds to the safety of the character while riding his bike. It also has the unfortunate side-effect of making him look a little odd when placed next to other versions of the character. I&rsquo;ve gotten so used to seeing Cap with that single stud on his head, seeing him with a hat covering it up just makes him look strange.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Outrider: These pair of Outriders (there are two in the set) use the exact same prints as the Outriders found in the Infinity War sets, but the models have been slightly improved upon, the back bracket is the same, but the multiple arms on the back are now using golden Wolverine claws attached to Exo-Force droid arms. This is unfortunate, it makes them exceptionally back heavy, when not attached to any studs they have a tendency to fall over.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Outrider: The third Outrider doesn&rsquo;t include the multiple arms, instead he features a shoulder pauldron which makes me believe he has seniority. His rank is probably commander or something. He still uses gold Wolverine claws though, he just holds them in his regular hands.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">No numbered bags this time, if you&rsquo;ve built any kind of Super Heroes motorcycle you will know that there is actually quite a lot of Technic pins and axles involved. Bulky looking brick section of the bike almost comes off as slightly too large as you build to balance properly, but fortunately balance does not turn out to be a huge problem. A few stickers are included to place on certain parts to add detailing, so you may want help to line it up just right. Other than that, this build isn&rsquo;t too thrilling or difficult.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This massive Technic built Motorcycle is exceptionally impressive, it has place for Cap and his Shield, and on top of that all of the energy elements sticking out make it look almost like a steampunk nightmare. It is a model that was never in the movie though, at no point does Cap run roughshod over his enemies on top of a monster motorcycle shooting flames everywhere. Or discs with the Avengers logo on them. I get making sets to be fun and toys for the most part, but I can&rsquo;t understand why LEGO insists on making so many stupid looking massively oversized Motorcycles in the Marvel and DC Super Hero ranges?</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ok, Ninjago gets a lot of motorcycles too, but Ninjago has a narrative reason to include motorcycles and they actually appear in the television show. These might seem fun to play with, and kids more than likely are impressed by them, but as a set for Endgame where there is so much to draw from on-screen without relying on such made up nonsense, this is poorly executed.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set needs work. I love the Minifigures. I don&rsquo;t like the model they used for the action in this set. It might have been nicer to see LEGO finally make a Chitauri Space Whale Monster Ship thing, even if it wasn&rsquo;t entirely to scale, and give Cap a smaller bike to ride on with firing stud shooters or something, rather than this massive mess of a motorcycle they wound up giving us. Overall. I do not recommend this set, skip it if you can. Not Recommended.</p>
