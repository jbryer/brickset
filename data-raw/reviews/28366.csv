"Seally7712","2019-07-09T23:55:56.737Z","Decent","<p>This set is very good overall, there are only two main flaws, one being the connection of two vent like pieces to the lower torso, the vent piece is a one by two. While the connection point is a one by one tile. That is flaw one, flaw two is that war machine doesn&#39;t fit inside the mech unless you take off his gun.</p>

<p>Overall i give this set a B+.(LegoLad Reviews)</p>

<p>The set doesn&#39;t appear in Endgame though like all the other sets in the wave</p>
