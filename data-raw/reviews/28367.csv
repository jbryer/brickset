<p>Tony Stark a.k.a. Iron Man uses Iron Man Suit MK 85 in Avengers: Endgame, so it makes sense that he would need a place to store the 42 suits he has used since he launched the &quot;Clean Slate Protocol&quot; in Iron Man 3. This Hall of Armors set seems directly based on the one seen in Iron Man 1-3 which was destroyed by Aldrich Killian&#39;s forces when they blew up the Malibu Mansion. Given that this is an Avengers: Endgame set, and this room and 3 of the 4 Iron Man suits included in the set were destroyed in Iron Man 3, this set&#39;s existence seems to indicate time travel. (Or Tony just rebuilt the Hall of Armors at the Avengers Facility)</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><em>Iron Man mk 1&nbsp;</em>is an amazing minifigure that Marvel fans have wanted since the beginning of the Lego Marvel theme. The torso and leg&nbsp;printing is&nbsp;incredibly intricate, effectively recreating the suit&#39;s re-purposed look. The prints .&nbsp;show markings that would have been on the missile that the suit is made of. The helmet isn&#39;t perfect, but I think it is easily the best mold that LEGO already have, and it is printed very nicely too with some nice sand prints representing the desert that this suit is made in. All 3 old Iron Man suits have a transparent head.</p>

<p><em>Iron Man mk 5 &quot;The Suitcase&quot;&nbsp;</em>is another great Iron Man minifigure that has a nice combination of silver and dark red. The torso print looks really good, with the arc reactor and the silver highlights being very reflective. The leg print looks just as good with a continuation of silver highlights. The helmet is the typical two piece Iron Man helmet in dark red with a silver facemask. The prints on the facemask look amazing, although I wish the eyes were blue instead of white.</p>

<p><em>Iron Man mk 41 &quot;Bones&quot;&nbsp;</em>is a really good looking figure as well, featuring a black base color with gold highlights. The torso and legs show off the suit&#39;s mechanical parts or &quot;bones&quot; under layers of gold plating. The helmet once again is the original Iron Man helmet, but this piece still look s great in my opinion. The helmet is black and the facemask is gold with black line printed across it.</p>

<p><em>Iron Man mk 50</em>&nbsp;first appeared in Avengers: Infinity War and was also the first suit made of nano-tech, allowing Stark to manipulate it into different forms and weapons, depending on what he needed to fight Thanos and the Black Order. Thanos destroys this armor and impales Stark with it, nearly killing him, although Tony could rebuild the nano-tech&nbsp;to reconstruct the armor fo Endgame. This minifigure appeared in 2 Infinity War sets from last year, but it still looks great featuring a much more organic look than any of it&#39;s predecessors. The suit&#39;s head is the first to include a heads up display&nbsp;on Tony&#39;s face. It also has a smug expression. The set includes a hair piece for this figure.</p>

<p><em>The outriders&nbsp;</em>appear in 7 Marvel sets so they aren&#39;t that special, but they look good and are very massable.</p>

<p><strong>DUM-E</strong></p>

<p>This LEGO version of Tony&#39;s clumsy&nbsp;robot is awesome. It looks great and is very posable. I love how DUM-E has a party hat also!! The set include two flames for DUM-E to put out with its fire extinguisher.</p>

<p><strong>Iron Man mk 38 &quot;Igor&quot;</strong></p>

<p>This is the first Lego version of Igor and it looks okay, but it is kind of blocky because a minifigure fits inside of it.&nbsp;I&#39;m not sure that I like the facemask on this one because it doesn&#39;t really look right. Igor&#39;s color scheme is perfect and it has ball-joints at every joint, so it is very posable.</p>

<p><strong>The Hall of Armors</strong></p>

<p>LEGO released a tiny Hall of Armor in the Malibu Mansion set, but they never released a full version... until now. This Lego version of the Hall of Armors looks fantastic and it is incredibly modular, allowing a person to create exactly how they want the Hall of Armors to look.</p>

<p>The assembly platform looks perfect with yellow arms and a rotating platform. It has technic axles that allow it to be attached to the armor slots and the computer desk.</p>

<p>The computer desk looks great with stickers on transparent light blue pieces, representing Tony Stark&#39;s holographic computers. It features a rotating chair for Stark to sit at and an axle receiver brick so it can be connected with the rest of the hall.</p>

<p>The 7 regular suit pods look great and work well for displaying a LEGO Iron Man collection. Each pod consists of a window piece with angled bricks in front of it, creating a cool look when a suit is placed in the pod. The pods can be stacked if the owner desires them to be.&nbsp;The center one has a beam that connects to a technic axle and features a sticker showing Iron Man mk 25 a.k.a. &quot;Striker,&quot; a suit which hasn&#39;t been made in LEGO&nbsp;form. The pod to the right features a mk 5 &quot;Suitcase&quot; sticker and the pod to the left of the middle one features a &quot;House Party Protocol&quot; sticker. The other four normal suit pods have no stickers.</p>

<p>The workbench pod is the same as the normal ones except that it has a workbench. It has a place to store an extra helmet or Stark&#39;s hair.</p>

<p>The blender pod is a reference to Iron Man 2 when Tony tries to stop his infection from spreading by drinking healthy smoothies. The pod is once again the same build as the others with a counter. The blender looks great and comes with a coffee mug.</p>

<p>The set includes 5 little builds to customize the Hall of Armor, the first of which is just a ladder to attach to the side of the left most pod so a figure can climb on top of the hall. The second is a satellite dish to put on top of the pods. The third and forth are racks for storing weapons for the suits. The weapons include a stud-shooter a light blade and a jetpack. The fifth build is a small tool rack with a wrench.</p>

<p><strong>Final Opinion</strong></p>

<p>This set is nothing short of amazing!!! The customizing ability is very fun and the minifigures are great! Igor isn&#39;t the best&nbsp;&nbsp;but it is pretty good considering Iron Man can fit inside it. DUM-E and the Hall of Armors are both perfect and I love the new Iron Man suits. The figures from Infinity war are nice too.</p>

<p>In the U. S. A. this set costs $60 dollars and I would definitely recommend the set for that, but on release day Target has this for 20% off!!!!!! Now the set costs less than $50 dollars and I recommend it to any Marvel fan should they get it for that price!!!<b>&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed my review of LEGO 76125</p>

<p><b>Second Final Opinion (After seeing Endgame)</b></p>

<p>So turns out this isn&rsquo;t an Avengers Endgame set, but it was randomly released for the movie. I was wondering why the box art on this wave just said &ldquo;Avengers,&rdquo; not Avengers Endgame, but I guess it&rsquo;s because this set has nothing to do with Endgame at all. It&rsquo;s not an Iron Man 3 set either because it has Infinity War&rsquo;s &nbsp; &nbsp;Mk 50 and an outrider, both of which didn&rsquo;t show up in Iron Man 3. I still love this set as it was an iconic location not previously made in LEGO, and I appreciate that LEGO made some of the older Iron Man suits. The set is definitely worth getting, especially because of Tony&rsquo;s Endgame fate, so this is the maybe the last chance to get a bunch of Iron Man figures if you loved him 3000</p>

"EnergyBlast_Productions","2019-07-04T22:26:59.143Z","""J.A.R.V.I.S...drop my needle""","<p>Marvel Super Heroes is a particular theme that I&#39;ve always had a hard time falling in love with.&nbsp; Sometimes it&#39;s good, a lot of times it&#39;s bad, and there are a few occasions when Lego will drop a&nbsp;<em>really good&nbsp;</em>set.&nbsp; In terms of the more recent wave of sets for Avengers: Endgame, there really wasn&#39;t much that impressed me - in fact, the only real reason I wanted sets like&nbsp;<strong>War Machine Buster&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Captain America: Outriders Attack&nbsp;</strong>was for the awesome new helmet molds for Cap and Ant-Man.</p>

<p>This set was one that I was willing to really give a chance, since it had a really great selection of figures and the idea of the set was really intriguing to me.&nbsp; The price was definitely the biggest turn-off with this set, but I&#39;ll get onto that later.&nbsp; Iron Man is probably my favorite hero in the MCU, and this set is a great tribute to the character, even if I do have a lot of issues with it.</p>

<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>The build for this set is pretty simple, but some nice design choices are used.&nbsp; Each of the nine units for the wall are completely identical with decorations and suits removed, so I can definitely see this being sort of an annoying build for some people.&nbsp; There are some nice building techniques and designs used, but nothing that particularly impressed me.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>The first three out of 6 minfigures in this set (7 if you count Igor) are nonexclusive and are simply carried over from last year&#39;s Infinity War wave.&nbsp; Mark 50 Iron Man is a fantastic minifigure and arguably the best we&#39;ve gotten, even though I really do wish we had gotten the new suit from Endgame here instead.&nbsp; Printing is fantastic and the dual expressions on the head are great.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two Outriders are completely identical and both have the extra four arms clipped to the piece on their backs.&nbsp; Printing on the torso and head is great, but these figures are so common now that it really isn&#39;t anything too exciting to get more of these guys.</p>

<p>The first of the exclusive Iron Man suits is the Mark 1 from the first Iron Man movie in 2008.&nbsp; It is the only suit that includes the &quot;Invincible Iron Man&quot; style helmet instead of the more common mold, and the figure is predominately molded in a shiny silver color.&nbsp; The printing on the torso and legs of this figure are absolutely fantastic, and show a lot of great detail.&nbsp; The helmet is really the only throw-off for me, since the shaping of it is still too sleek and modern to pass off as something built from scraps.&nbsp; A new mold would have done perfectly, but I understand that they were trying to work with what they had.&nbsp; A jetpack piece is also included separately in this set if you want the Mark 1 to fly off like in the movie.</p>

<p>The Mark 5 is the second armor included in this set, and it represents the awesome red and silver design from one short scene in Iron Man 2.&nbsp; I&#39;ve always loved this suit from the film, and it&#39;s great that we&#39;re getting figures from movies that came out pre-Avengers, since Marvel Super Heroes didn&#39;t exist as a Lego theme until that movie.&nbsp; The silver and red designs on the figure are spot on and accurate, but my favorite part of the figure is the awesome lines on the silver faceplate for the helmet.&nbsp; It&#39;s very different than what we&#39;ve gotten before on Iron Man figures, and it looks really cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Mark 41, nicknamed &quot;Bones&quot;, is probably the most unique suit design we&#39;ve gotten for Iron Man in minfigure form, and it sports an awesome black and gold color scheme.&nbsp; The torso and legs have a series of armor plates that almost look like scales, and the amount of detail put into the figure as a whole is really applaudible.&nbsp; The helmet design also looks really good.</p>

<p>Each of the exclusive armors has a clear head since no one is wearing them, but you can switch out Tony&#39;s head from the Mark 50 if you wish.</p>

<h2>Mark 38 &quot;Igor&quot;</h2>

<p>As the Mark 38 is a much larger armor compared to the standard minifigure, Lego took a similar route with designing the Igor suit as they did with the various versions of the Hulkbuster that we&#39;ve received over the years.&nbsp; The Mark 38 is built in similar scale to a bigfig, and can actually hold a minfigure&nbsp;inside, which is really cool but is unfortunately my biggest issue with this build.&nbsp; The mech design that is used to open up and close to hold Tony while inside the suit leaves some really obvious holes and openings in the side of the armor, where you can visibly see the figure inside.&nbsp; Despite this, the Mark 38 still has a nice color scheme and design, even if its not the best.&nbsp; The helmet is by far the biggest issue I&#39;ve seen people bring up with this build, and while it isn&#39;t the best, I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s horrible.&nbsp; The printed one by two tile paired with a duck-bill looking piece is...alright I guess.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>Starting with the side builds, there are some miscellaneous additions such as two small flames and a small build for Dum-E, Tony&#39;s robot assitant from the movies.&nbsp; I particularly like the white cone piece used for Dum-E&#39;s hat that he wears in Iron Man 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next build is the only part of the Hall of Armor that can be removed from the rest of the build - Tony&#39;s computer desk.&nbsp; It&#39;s a pretty standard build with a desk chair and four hologram screens around the desk with stickers representing different things and even references.&nbsp; My favorite sticker detail is a picture of Phil Coulson&nbsp;with words reading &quot;Blocked Caller&quot; as a reference to when Tony ghosts Coulson in Iron Man 2.&nbsp; There&#39;s a nice red mug for Tony to drink from on his long nights working on new suits.</p>

<p>The last part of the set before the actual hall is a decent-sized platform for Tony to suit up.&nbsp; The transparent blue radar dish piece adds some nice color and detail, and there is a posable robot arm on both sides to help assemble all the parts onto Tony.&nbsp; The computer desk can be connected to the front of the platform.</p>

<p>The complete wall comprises of nine individual identical units, each built of a majority of light gray parts and a blue tall window pane piece for each.&nbsp; Some of the panes have a sticker referencing a particular suit.&nbsp; There are a few more references to the films on these panes, such as one in particular that mentions &quot;House Party Protocol&quot; from the final battle in Iron Man 3.&nbsp; There&#39;s a ladder on one end of the wall leading to the top, which has a railing and studs to build onto the hall from the bottom up.&nbsp; A radar dish stands on one of the uints as well.</p>

<p>Along with having room to display the four suits included in the set, the rest of the units hold different items that Tony stashes in his lab: a smoothie blender, a stand holding a red stud shooter and a blue piece resembling Tony&#39;s repulsor blasts, a stand for the Mark 1&#39;s jetpack, and one last stand for Tony&#39;s hairpiece when he&#39;s not wearing it, a fire extinguisher, and a hammer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The overall look of the wall is very neat and easily expanded on if you wish to buy more than one of this set.&nbsp; The set isn&#39;t incredibly interesting at first glance, but it does serve great collection purposes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Price</h2>

<p>This set retails for $59.99 in US dollars, which is insanely high for a set with only 524 pieces, and even 50 dollars seems like its asking a lot.&nbsp; The size of the set is only about the same as sets like the&nbsp;<strong>Hydro Man Attack&nbsp;</strong>from Spider-Man Far From Home, which is 20 dollars cheaper.&nbsp; It is true that you get a good-sized Igor build, but it still doesn&#39;t feel like a $60 set.&nbsp; If you can pick this up on sale, it&#39;s great, but the price is definitely something to consider before purchasing this set.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>In conclusion, this is still probably my favorite Endgame set, but that isn&#39;t saying a lot.&nbsp; The price, like I said, is staggering, but the build is very useful for displaying your minifigures.&nbsp; The minfigures are fantastic - some of the best Marvel minfigures to date - and the set gives you quite a bit to play around with.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would love to say that I recommend this set, but I really can&#39;t because of the price.</p>

"Isj_rocks","2020-05-16T21:11:15.887Z","A great set from... Endgame?","<p><strong>Introduction: </strong>Despite&nbsp;this set having&nbsp;nothing to do with the film it&rsquo;s based on, it stands as one of my favorite sets ever!&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s begin an in depth view of this set!</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures: </strong>The minifigures here are 4/6 amazing. The two Outriders seem a like a little much considering how they&rsquo;ve been packed into the entire wave. I do enjoy the torso printing on them, and the neck attachment is very nice. Moving on to Iron Man Mark 50, this minifigure was included in two sets for Infinity War, but this is the only one in the&nbsp;wave and this set is also the cheapest way to get it. I do enjoy the figure, but do think Mark 80 might have been more accurate to the movie. Moving down to Mark 41, this minifigure is my favourite of the set. The gold detailing all over the figure is amazing, and accurate to the suits&#39; appearance from Iron Man 3. Going down in order, we have Mark 5 or &ldquo;Suitcase&rdquo;. Mark 5 is another exceptional figure, the faint blue detailing on the chest is very nice. As someone who owned the Iron Man 3 Malibu Mansion set, I especially appreciate the inclusion of the Mark 5 suit since it was teased with the suitcase back then. Lastly, we have the suit that started it all, Mark 1. I absolutely love this Mark 1 figure, the helmet mold here works perfectly. The fully detailed figure has everything except arm printing. Also, the jetpack included in the set works well with Mark 1. Overall for the figures&nbsp;the only thing I&rsquo;d change is swapping an Outrider figure for a suit like Mark 2 or Pepper Potts.</p>

<p><strong>Build: </strong>The set makes interesting choices when it comes to builds, let&rsquo;s look at the Igor suit first. The Igor suit is good, but it could be better. I like the stickers put on the hands for the gritty construction look, I dislike the face and inside. The Dum-E here has a different color scheme the one that was included in the polybag. Moving&nbsp;on to the desk, we have tons of translucent blue pieces with clear&nbsp;stickers on them. Here many easter eggs can be found, the first one is alerting the Outriders presence. The next one has Agent Phil Coulson on it, labeled as a blocked caller, referring to the first Avengers movie. Next is a simple keyboard, and lastly one saying J.A.R.V.I.S referring to Tony Starks artificial intelligence system. Moving over to the center stand, this is most likely based off of the system Tony used to remove his Mark 3 armor. Lastly the main build, the Hall of Armors. Each small station is easily detachable giving endless play opportunities. The build offers spots for the four suits that are included in the set, but fills the others with smaller builds such as a blender, weapon rack, jetpack holder, and work station. These builds are easy to remove for the rest of your Iron Man armors. Also included on top is a radar satellite.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: </strong>As a Lego Marvel fan, this set is a dream come true, even if it was marketed for Endgame, I&rsquo;m just happy it was made. The minifigures are really great, the build is pretty good, I&rsquo;d absolutely recommend this set! I&rsquo;m also really hopeful about the rumors of an add-on set coming this summer, so that&rsquo;s my review!</p>
