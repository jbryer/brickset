"beskadberserker","2019-04-14T01:30:20.263Z","I have a new favorite Quinjet.","<p>To switch things up, I&#39;ll start with the cons, because there&#39;s only 1. That one con is the goofy trike that is included with the set. It&#39;s just not very aesthetically pleasing and it&#39;s kind of silly to have to lay a minifig down on it. Come on, guys, the 2008 Mars Mission line had better add-on vehicles than that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next, the minifigs. At first I was apprehensive about all the Avengers in this line having the exact same torso. And yes, I very much hope that later, we will get each hero in their own unique outfits. But now that I have 8 white-suited Avengers, they all display very well together. Once again, Thor&#39;s Stormbreaker build is a little underwhelming. But it&#39;s Lego. You can fix that with a few spare brown elements. The rest of the figures are fine, although I would have liked a lille more uniqueness in Black&nbsp;Widow and Hawkeye. Some new face prints or more fitting hair molds would have been superb, but they are just fine as is. The Chitauri faces look a little odd, but they are represented well enough. Their built-up guns represent their movie counterparts fairly well.</p>

<p>Now to the main course. What a delight. This Quinjet has so much usable space. First off, the pilot&#39;s cabin is not closed off from the rest of the jet as with every other model. Minifigs in the cargo bay can see the pilot, and I am happy for that. In the first section back from the cockpit, there are a pair of seats for passengers. You can also stand minfigs in the compartment, especially if you remove a little bit of the tiling meant to hold the tricycle in the aft cargo bay. You can fit 5 minfigs and most of their gear in this section without a fuss. The rear is dedicated to holding the trike and the flip-up stud shooter, which to their credit, can both fit in the allotted space at the same time. However, I simply elected to leave out the stud shooter and I like to pretend that the trike does not exist. As a result, there is a cavernous space fit for whatever use you desire. There&#39;s a lot you can do with the 6x10 stud area. Without the trike and stud shooter, this jet can fit 11 minifigures&nbsp;inside of it with no additional modification. I&#39;m a sucker for massive interior space, so I absolutely adore being able to fit practically the entire&nbsp;<em>Endgame&nbsp;</em>cast in one build.</p>

<p>The build experience itself is very pleasant, including some interesting SNOT work towards the rear. The whole assembly flows together really well, and I am, at times, unable to resist just picking this thing up and swooshing it around. The price to piece ratio is very fair, especially given that Walmart (where I got it) had this on sale for 64 dollars, an absolute steal. I have to recommend this set to any Marvel collector, along with anyone who likes a nice Lego plane. This is hands-down the best Lego Quinjet, and one of the very best Lego Marvel sets.&nbsp;</p>

"Ghosty","2019-07-15T23:15:02.497Z","Best Endgame set out of all of them","<p>This set has to be the best set out of all of the Endgame sets. The Captain America motorcycle is a bit oversized, and&nbsp;ridiculous, while the Hall of Amour is $10 overpriced, same with the Compound set being overpriced as well. The set&#39;s interior is amazing for a lego vehicle, and the build is awesome for a lego quinjet. The only downside is the minifigures. Most of the minifigures have the same torso printing, and half of them have the same legs. On the other hand, the&nbsp;chitauri&nbsp;minifigures&#39; printing are a major downgrade, from the original chitauri minifigures from 2012.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I think you should get this set. It&#39;s a nice jet, and it&#39;s definitely&nbsp;worth the price.</p>

"Vikn","2021-02-20T12:12:04.737Z","Quite a solid ship build","<p>I&#39;ll preface my review by saying that I am merely a casual fan of superheroes in general. While I see 75% of the movies in theatres, I have only seen most of them once with the exception of both&nbsp;Guardians films and the 1st Iron Man. Maybe this set will mean more to big Marvel fans, or maybe the Quinjet isn&#39;t particularly popular among hardcore fans...I would imagine that is a factor in whether or not this set is worthwhile.</p>

<p>Despite being a fairweather fan I do have a few Marvel sets just because there are some standouts. I only got back into Lego for most of 2019 and again the past couple months (dec2020-feb2021) so I have only had access to sets available in those time frames. With that in mind, I did enjoy this set more than I would have anticipated. It didn&#39;t blow me away, but that&#39;s partially attributed to it being a smallish set. At this point, I only tend to buy mostly 2kpc+ sets, so naturally it being &quot;smallish&quot; is subjective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although it didn&#39;t &quot;blow me away&quot;, it was a consistent and enjoyable build throughout. I cannot speak to playability, but the build was more enjoyable than many of its size and the final product is quite well made and a nice display piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While this is a very good set, it isn&#39;t even my favorite Marvel ship. I don&#39;t have many, but by far my favorite set in the theme is another ship set, Thanos Ultimate Battle+Thor&#39;s Weapon Quest...I consider the latter nearly&nbsp;required to have if one has the former. What makes that a better ship, aside from my personal bias towards the Guardians, is the respectable addition that Thor&#39;s Weapon Quest provides, bulking the ship up a noticeable amount and offering a great selection between the two&nbsp;that provides four of the Guardians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With my bias and the necessity in getting the smaller addition taken into account, perhaps the Quinjet will be more enjoyable for the average Marvel/Lego fan. It is larger and a bit sleeker and the interior of the Quinjet is very surprisingly roomy. I tend to outright hate when Lego tacks on goofy looking, scaled down vehicles to pad out a set&#39;s price, I actually found the small bike/trike in this set to work without feeling like an excuse to charge even more than the normal, relatively exorbitant pricing. It fits within the jet and makes something interesting with a small amount of pieces, thankfully allocating a majority to the main build (something they need to do more often).</p>

<p>With Hawkeye/Ronin, Black Widow (blonde), Rocket, Thor (axe) and two Chitauri, you get a respectable selection of cool characters. Widow and Hawkeye particularly feel like they &quot;fit&quot; the Quinjet. It has a sleek, secret agent vibe and so it stands to reason that the two human agent-type avengers would fit best. The only potential knock against the figures is that all four heroes are wearing the time travel suits from endgame, and we don&#39;t get the figures with the original looks. Not significant to me, but maybe some will care.</p>

<p>All together, the Quinjet is a very solid aerial build. While I personally like the Thanos Ultimate Battle+Thor&#39;s Weapon Quest better, I feel more and more like that&#39;s just my Guardians bias and that this is a comparable or even better set to some fans. I guess it just comes down to how much of a Marvel fan you are and if you are partial to this jet or any of the characters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having seen every other Quinjet lego has released, I can say that this is EASILY the best. Going back, I would likely buy it again, and I&nbsp;would certainly never buy any of the other lego iterations...likely because I am strongly biased against Lego&#39;s obnoxious habit of giving us ludicrous looking vehicles that&#39;re waaaaaaay too scaled down and play focused. The previous iteration(s) are/were just that, essentially micro versions of this vehicle..</p>

<p>So if you need a Quinjet, this is the a no brainer compared to it&#39;s previous versions. If you love the original six Avengers and prefer them to the Guardians, this is probably the better of the two vehicles.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is one aspect of this build that felt refreshingly novel for such a jet. The gun on the back is very cool. It feels like an old west machine gun and has the rotating barrels that fire off studs as it rotates, shooting off 6 in quick succession. I normally have no interest in that sort of feature as I never have a use for it, but this one was notable and worth mentioning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have much more to say as it doesn&#39;t do anything really unique aside from that but overall it&#39;s just a high quality jet build from the Marvel universe.&nbsp;</p>
