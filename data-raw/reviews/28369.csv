<p>Oh, boy. This set is a stinker! The initial Endgame wave was shrouded in secrecy (for no reason as the sets were a complete deviation from the film), so I was particularly excited when they revealed them. Endgame was a film I had anticipated for so long, so I was obviously excited for the sets. Boy was I disappointed.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience + Model</strong></p>

<p>The building experience was nothing special, as usual.</p>

<p>The model consists of two large white buildings (quite interesting, right?). The one on the left is a garage that can hold a small car and a small helicopter. Both of these are done in the dark blue and black Avengers color scheme. Both of these are boring and useless and are only included for little kids to play with. The garage is very basic, and it doesn&#39;t even have walls on the back or the left side. The turrets provide some play value, although stud shooters aren&#39;t much fun for anyone above the age of 5.</p>

<p>There&#39;s a walkway that allows for easy passage onto the building on the right. Strangely, there is no way for minifigures to get to the helipad or the second floor. The building on the right is the main office. On the first floor, there&#39;s a holding cell for the Infinity Gauntlet which is graciously included. There&#39;s also a basic little computer board. The second floor is very plain as well, although the rotating door and the hidden guns in the table are quite cool. The spring-loaded shooter above is also uninteresting, although it has quite a good range of motion.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The minifigures were always the main draw for this set, but even they&#39;re disappointing.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get the great to decent figures out of the way. First is Iron Man, the best figure in this set. He looks amazing and has one of my favorite Iron Man suits. I would&#39;ve wished for arm printing, but I really don&#39;t care as this figure is excellent. Hulk is also great, although a bit generic seeing as we already have a decent Hulk big fig. He&#39;s still a welcome inclusion. Nebula has a great new head, and that&#39;s about it. Nanofig Ant-man looks great as well, and two are included in this set.</p>

<p>The Outrider is just lame, with no cool variations from the standard Outrider figure. Captain Marvel is terrible, she is the exact same as the figure in 76127. The lack of dual-molded legs really kills this figure for me.</p>

<p>Lastly is Thanos, a lackluster rendition of the character. At the time of this set&#39;s release, no one knew we&#39;d get another Thanos bigfig, which makes the last version of this character&nbsp;<em>especially</em>&nbsp;disappointing. The helmet is the same outdated one from 2016. The printing on the front pales in comparison to the new one, and the only good things that came from this are the printed arms, which we can use for the new Thanos. Overall, a disappointing version of this character which makes me appreciate the new one&nbsp;<em>much</em>&nbsp;more.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>Sheesh, this set goes from bad to worse. $100 for 700 pieces? I get it, there are two big figs, but you&#39;d think that they&#39;d be of higher quality seeing as this is such a high rice bump. The build also has absolutely no play value for older fans. The build is boring on display as well. The value ultimately fails on every end.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Good&nbsp;Iron Man, Hulk, Nebula, and Ant-man figures</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Terrible and boring build</li>
	<li>No good play features</li>
	<li>Only 2 Infinity stones included</li>
	<li>Useless car and helicopter</li>
	<li>Disappointing Thanos minifigure</li>
	<li>Re-used Captain Marvel and Outrider figures</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>I&#39;m gonna get straight to the point here, NO, you should not buy this set. Order the Nebula, Hulk, and Thanos from eBay. Iron Man is included in the new 2021 sets. Besides a few of the minifigures, this set is absolutely useless. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this set to anyone but the most dedicated of Marvel fans (those that will buy every set just to have it). There is nothing here that you can&#39;t get in other, better, sets.</p>
