"Faefrost","2019-01-21T18:38:22.747Z","Tracer at a low cost ","<p>The lowest cost Overwatch&nbsp;set. Which has a pair of surprisingly desirable minifigs. Fan and Cosplay favorites Tracer and Widowmaker. Both masterfully rendered with new unique pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions - It&#39;s the standard Overwatch&nbsp;yellow and grey&nbsp;trim box. It has a nice distinct look to it that stands out on the shelf, and looks very different from all the other Lego packaging. The front shows Tracer and Widowmaker&nbsp;alongside the Drone &quot;objective&quot;. The back shows theat the Drone can also be used as a small vehicle with Tracer piloting it. Nothing exciting. Surprisingly the instructions on the last page reveal one feature not found on the box. That this also functions as an add on for 75975 Watchpoint&nbsp;Gibralters&nbsp;Shuttle Rocket. It sockets onto the back of the larger craft. Which would have made for a good selling point on the box itself.</p>

<p>Minifigs&nbsp;- The set has two fantastic minifigs. Spunky British Hero Tracer, and the menacing Widowmaker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Tracer - Overwatch&#39;s&nbsp;two gun weilding speedster looks perfect. She has a custom spiky hair piece, dual sided face. Front and back printed detailed torso and a neck bracket for a lightning bolt speed effect. She has printed legs although the printing is fairly minimal just some straps. She features 2 white pistold, which I believe are new for the Overwatch&nbsp;line. They are further enhanced with some round plates and studs. Each having multiple connection points. They aren&#39;t exact to Tracers in game guns, but sufice nicely and provide a great base for constructing all manner of fancy SciFi/Comic Book type weapons.</p>

<p>Widowmaker - Widowmaker&nbsp;is a fantastically detailed figure with a unique molded hairpiece including her trademark Spiders eye goggles on ger forehead. With her hair a vibrant purple ponytail. A pale purple head with dual sided faces. A nicely printed torso front and back and printed legs. She uses a single black Tracer style gun as the base unit for her brick built sniper rifle. And also includes a grappling hook. She is the third best figure in the line behind Tracer as #2 and Dva as #1.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts - There is not too much particularly noteworthy beyond the new figure/weapon parts. There are some new shaped fins for the Drone. That nice printed &quot;Drone Charge Station&quot; radar dish which also comes with Watchpoint Gibralter&nbsp;and a printed trans blue cylinder&nbsp;that is a health power up. Most markings are stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build/Model - Enjoyable for what it is. It&#39;s a very small pseudo space shuttle. Nothing revolutionary. It will take you 10 minutes from box opening until completion. It&#39;s playable and swooshable. But nothing noteworthy.</p>

<p>Overall - It&#39;s the smallest set. Not quite an impulse buy at $15 us, but really just a character pack with a small build. You are buying this for Tracer and Widowmaker. It&#39;s worth it just for them.&nbsp;</p>

"Puidwen","2019-02-12T20:51:39.557Z","A terrific set","<p>I&#39;ve only played the free weekends but to me the set aesthetics do seem very overwatch-y.&nbsp; This set comes with a lot of parts for the money, granted a lot of those are things like 1x1 studs.&nbsp; I&#39;ve had to re-snap a few pieces while building, for some reason in the early stages this set can be a bit loose.&nbsp; Watch the orientation of the stickers, I&#39;ve kept wanting to put them on the wrong way.&nbsp; If you build this exactly according to the instructions tracer can&#39;t actually&nbsp;sit a mini-fig inside it.&nbsp; You will have to remove two pieces over the cock pit.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-01-01T19:51:13.877Z","A Theme Too Late to Last, But Pretty Good.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #75970 Tracer vs. Widowmaker:</b> LEGO Overwatch returns to my reviews with the smallest set from the first wave with the two biggest characters I&rsquo;ve seen in most fan community discussions of the game itself. This set is meant to link up with the largest space shuttle set, a set I have yet to pick up, but I got this set alongside D.Va&rsquo;s set because I appreciated the overall look of the model and what was included in the pair of sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: The packaging for Overwatch is actually an early design that kind of has hints of what they did later with Hidden Side. The difference being that it isn&rsquo;t just digital art here, but actual physical artwork of the set and characters in the set. Both sides are printed with the set number, piece count and other pertinent information, it seems to be something LEGO wants to do more of considering how Hidden Side would adopt this style of packaging later on.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: The manual is folded in half and serviceable for what you get. It shows you how to build the set, what you can do when you have this and the large shuttle set and that&rsquo;s pretty much it. You&rsquo;ll find a sticker set inside as well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There aren&rsquo;t a ton of parts in this set, but you will find a large printed LEGO dish piece and a 1x1 cylinder piece with a cross printed on it. Most of the rest of the detailing is stickers applied to standard LEGO parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Tracer: This Minifigure is highly detailed, at least with her torso and facial printing, but the legs are only slightly printed. Her hair piece is brand new to capture the iconic look of the character. Her expressions are two different smiles, one with open mouth visible teeth, the other closed mouth. For accessories she has two white pistols with additional elements added for detailing. She&rsquo;s also wearing a back bracket piece with a lightning burst sticking out&hellip; must be something to the character in the game, it just looks fairly odd in my opinion.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Widowmaker: With a unique hair sculpt to capture the look of the character and a far more detailed print for her torso and legs, Widowmaker stands out more to me despite Tracer being the &lsquo;Poster Child&rsquo; of Overwatch. Her gun is a massive amount of brick building attached to the new pistol piece, which is a great accessory and highly versatile. She also has a hook, perhaps to grapple up. Her facial expressions are a scowling angry look and a winking smirk.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Making the little drone was extremely engaging and actually quite fun, the engines in the back were a fun aspect of the build. Overall I had no problems while building this set, the only issues I foresee could be the need to place stickers on parts just so to make them look properly. Overall a solid build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is Satellite Drone XR-9, it attaches to the larger shuttle from the largest set in the Overwatch Theme and is part of an Escort mission in the game, from what I understand of the mechanics. The large printed dish is meant to be a Drone Recharge Station, to refuel the power core. Two 3x2 tiles can pop off and you can stick a Minifigure inside to pilot the Drone. You can play with the model too, it swooshes through the air nicely and is a fun little shuttle to fly around when engaging in action adventures with the characters.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Fans of Overwatch who aren&rsquo;t interested in LEGO are going to just ignore these sets. Fans of LEGO who aren&rsquo;t into Overwatch might give them a look, but may choose not to get them and build the sets, just want the new parts for their own creations. As a fan of most licensed Themes and someone who collects things that strike my fancy, this set is pretty bare bones when it comes to play features and building, but it&rsquo;s a solid little set and I enjoyed it. It may not be for you. I&rsquo;d recommend it. Recommended.</p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2019-06-14T22:39:45.897Z","What's the big deal fighting over a spaceship? Why is it so important? These are some of life's greatest mysteries...","<p>Hello guys, sorry that I got around so late to reviewing this. Just as a disclaimer notice ahead, I don&#39;t play Overwatch but the sets caught my eye, much more than the Minecraft&nbsp;sets even though I play that game. Anyways, enough of me rambling, let&#39;s start off with the review</p>

<p><strong>The Box:&nbsp;</strong>I am aware that in a few of my previous reviews, I have removed my section on the box because the boxes tend to get the same after a while. However, the Overwatch sets are unique in this regard because while one side shows the product like most sets, the other side displays this unique CGI rendering of the set, which I find a cool aspext, especially for those who want to display their sets. The instructions aren&#39;t really special.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong>Minifigures are always a huge draw for me when I&#39;m buying sets and the minifgure selection does not disappoint me. In fact, the minifgure selection here is probably more detailed than most superhero or star wars sets if I&#39;m not mistaken. Anyways, first we got Tracer. I believe the design for her is well done and matches the concept nicely. She has printing all around, even on the back, which is covered by her blink ability. Her hairpiece is completely new, though somewhat similar to Kai&#39;s from the Ninjago movie, but it does the job well. She features 2 distinct smiling expressions and 2 pistols in white which are new for this wave. Widowmaker is equally as impressive and features as much if not more detail than Tracer. Her hairpiece is also new for this wave and is also quite distinctive, featuring purple hair, which we don&#39;t get a lot in Lego, that is augmented by some technology. She also comes with a giant gun that is quite well built as well as a grappling hook to reflect her grappling ability.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong>For the most part, I believe the set was rather easy to build and there weren&#39;t much complications. The stickers are a pain as always, but I realize that it would be quite more expensive if they printed everything and plus, it allow the pieces to retain their versatility. Other than that, I would caution users to pay close attention when building the thrusters because it is relatively easy to misplace a piece or two.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model: </strong>I have to admit, this set is pretty lacking on play features, which is a little surprising. Really, the only thing you could do is open a box, and even that feature isn&#39;t too easy or add or remove the stand. However, I will attest that this craft is rather swoosh-able and many parts won&#39;t break except for perhaps the wings. However, this also looks really nice on display and you could have the figures in poses fighting over the craft, which I have heard is not supposed to be used manually, but rather it is a autonomous machine. However, I think it&#39;s a good thing that Lego was able to incorporate this feature to sit a person even if it&#39;s not that accurate. After all, they can take creative license. &nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Thoughts:&nbsp;</b>Overall, I believe this is a well designed set. Not only is this on the cheaper end, which makes it an easier purchase for a lot of people, but it contains 2 really well designed figures, a decent craft and even a printed dish piece as well as a cute little health pack design. While it lacks a lot of features one would describe as typical, the craft is very swoosh-able and it is easy to imagine various role-play scenarios. Plus, this set looks great on display and it is nice to see Lego addressing an older audience. For $15, it is easy for myself to see this as an absolute win!!!!</p>

"Bricksidekick","2019-05-01T17:16:10.04Z","bad","<p>I&#39;m going to say the widowmaker vs tracer Lego set was kind of a downer. When I got the set I&nbsp;was excited to get something with original pieces, however there weren&#39;t any. (Except the hair pieces). The mini figures were outstanding but widowmaker&#39;s gun was very fragile and not good to play with. Tracer is amazing but the vehicle&nbsp;is disappointing. Overall this set was not as good as I&nbsp;thought.</p>
