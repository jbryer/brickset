<p>Box/Instructions - It&#39;s that nice golden yellow and grey Overwatch&nbsp;theme. But you have to look twice as the cover action feels a bit Ninjago. This feeling will carry through the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts - Other than some printed 2x2 round ammo disks for the disk throwers that carry Genji and Hanzo&#39;s emblems and a printed 1x1 health cylander there isn&#39;t that much interesting here. The most distinct part is the Katana in Neon Green.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs&nbsp;- Both the good and the bad of this set is perfectly found in the minifigs. They are nicely detailed, but suffer from some painful paint flaws.</p>

<p>Genji&nbsp;- Overwatch&#39;s&nbsp;armored cyborg Ninja. His body and legs are nicely printed with lots of detail. He has a Ninjago&nbsp;style scabard on his back and he carries the neon green katana. His helmet is a unique piece in pearl silver. Very striking. Unfortunately the head underneath it is a complete failure. It is a pearl silver minifig&nbsp;head... that they painted his pearl silver V shaped visor onto. At first you think it is a blank silver head, until you hold it under strong light, and squint. He also has the new hair ribbon piece in light bley.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hanzo - Hanzo is the most disappointing of the set. He should have been the most impressive figure in the set. With incredible detail, a nice new hairpiece with new gold ribbon. Quiver and bow. Everything should have worked. The problem is half of Hanzo&#39;s&nbsp;chest is supposed to be bare flesh. So Lego painted flesh color over his black plastic torso. And much like Mercy&#39;s face, it looks AWFUL. The paint is thin and translucunt. It does not match the flesh colored plastic adjacent to it. It just sucks. To add to that feeling, Hanzo&nbsp;while having plenty of hair to hide a second facial expresion in, for some reason only has a single sided face. Hanzo&nbsp;is in competition with Mercy for &quot;Worst Overwatch&nbsp;Minifig&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Guard (?) - I assume this is just some random security guard for the Ninja/Yakuza families shrine. Some generic thug. I LOVE THIS GUY! Best Minifig in the Set!!!! He has a nicely printed suit with some subtle details. A startled expression and a pompadour ala Dereth the Brown Ninja. He carries a fairly rare Lego automatic pistol and a cell phone. Unlike Genji and Hanzo&nbsp;he radiates emotion and character. I want to know who this is? He is a fantastic Figure that easily goes with any MOC in any theme. Even if you don&#39;t buy this set, bricklink this fig!</p>

<p>Build/Model - Ugh! It&#39;s not that it is bad. It&#39;s that it is pretty much every $20 price point Ninjago&nbsp;set ever made. It&#39;s a small shrine where are two Yakuza&nbsp;Ninja types Stage their big battle of honor. It&#39;s GI Joe Snake Eyes vs Storm Shadow. Or TMNT. Or Wolverine vs Silver Samurai. We&#39;ve seen this exact scene so many times. You could take this build and drop it into your Ninjago&nbsp;display unchanged and it would look perfect. (Although the current Ninjago&nbsp;matching $20 3 section shrine set comes with 5 minifigs&nbsp;instead of OW&#39;s 3. And they are the 5 best figs of the series)&nbsp; The little shrine has some nice details, pretty much all stickers. The only unique feature is each wing hides a disk thrower that firesd&nbsp;either Genji&nbsp;or Hanzo&#39;s&nbsp;symbol.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overview - The only purpose of this set is to give you Hanzo and Genji&nbsp;to use in the bigger better sets. The build will be used to fluff out youyr Ninjago&nbsp;MOC, nothing more. The Guard will happily find employment in the Lego Licensed big leagues. Why stand around sweeping up after these two badly panted idiots that cant decide if they are yakuza, ninja or cyborgs. There is good honest work to be had with Batman or Spider-Man. They pay well for a sharp dressed thug in a good suit that owns his own phone.</p>

<p>I would say get this set last in your Overwatch&nbsp;collecting. Definately get Dorado first.&nbsp;</p>
