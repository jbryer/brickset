So as a curious AFOL with a heart for funny/weird characters this was my nr. one pick of the (assumed) first wave of sets.</p>

<p>What caught me at first sight besides the fact that you get three interesting characters (and mostly sets like these (for example &quot;superheroes&quot;... ;-)) are mainly bought because of the figures alone), is the fact that you actually get a lot of useful stuff. Many people complain about the depth of the building, but ist is absolutely sufficient for play and display. Want a bigger building? get yourself a modular or just tune this one up... ;-) The facade of it is beautifully designed, and the lamps at the archway, the openable windows and the little candle are nice details. Also the stickers on the building are enhancing the &quot;realism&quot; of the model compared to the source-material and add to the looks of it. Combined with the little market-stand with fruits, the ingenious pinata (also &quot;featured&quot; in the animated short &quot;hero&quot;) and the lanterns it makes a nice scenery ideal for play or display.</p>

<p>Next there is the hovering truck. A nice modified old-school-truck with round curves and bulky headlamps and a clever &quot;hovering-system&quot; that also is ideal for play and fits it&#39;s counterpart from the sources quite well. Finally we have the little power-reactor. A nice construction with some new pieces that looks good and - again - adds to the play value. Last but not least there is also a &quot;health-pack&quot; included - present in every set of the wave - a transparent blue cylinder with a red cross on it. Once again, the designers show their love for the detail and put into this set a funny homage to the culture of computer-games.</p>

<p>Finally, the figures. Except for Mc Cree they have no leg printing, and none of them has an alternate face, which is a little disappointing. To stay with this guy for a while, MC Cree is the most detailed and equipped one. He has detailed armor prints on the chest and back, a holster-leg-printing on one side, a knee-protector-print on the other, a revolver (and one spare ...), a poncho, a hat and also a hairpiece. So to make it short: the perfect incarnation of a &quot;cowboy from tomorrow&quot;!!</p>

<p>Next is Soldier 76. He has a nice torso-print with his signature nr. 76 on his back and an accurate mask-print. I think the little skin part above the visor is a bit too white, but this detail is quite marginal, because the hairpiece covers that part nearly totally. I think leg-printing would have optimized his appearance, but besides that, his design is on point! He wields an enormous brick-built gun that matches the source material quite good, but, like the guns used by the final figure, Reaper, have been reason for criticism. On one hand I understand the call for individual moulds for the guns, but on the other hand, the brick-built-versions are the better solution. They are &quot;more LEGO&quot; so to say. And they can be modified and changed. MORE play-value in my opinion is better than &quot;more realism&quot;! And for sure there already is someone making the more realistic designs available for the die-hard-fans... ;-)</p>

<p>Finally we have Reaper, the villain of the set. He wears a new cape-design and has a skull-like mask printing. His torso print features armour and ammunition prints that really suit him well. His guns should have been double-barreled shotguns but the design LEGO comes up with shows only one barrel. BUT I still love the design for them, because the look quite intimidating and so fit this deadly shadow perfectly.</p>

<p>Altogether I really must say that this is a wonderful set. Besides the fact, whether it is true to the source-material or not, it is a detailed playset with a lot of details! And that&#39;s what a LEGO-set should be all about in the first place. From the perspective of an AFOL, I also find joy in the fact, that LEGO captured those tiny little details from the universe of Overwatch and literally made them real in bricks on a really affordable level. So now folks, get your guns blazing for a showdown in Dorado!!!</p>

"Cooliocdawg","2019-01-13T18:17:03.543Z","These aren't your strengths any more!!!","<p>This set is absolutely incredible. It has great minifigs, a cool build, and excellent details.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build: the truck, while&nbsp;clearly the &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;focus of this set is not .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; the best part. The.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; building is the highlight.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; of&nbsp;the set to me. The.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;details like the candle,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;poster from the.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;animated short, and the .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; pinata, (also from the .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; short) really make this.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;set my favorite in the .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; wave. I love the truck as .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; well.</p>

<p>The figures: soldier 76 is probably .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; my favorite character.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; from the game so I was .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;excited to see him in a.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; cheaper set. His jacket.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is instantly.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; recognizable.&nbsp; and.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; looks&nbsp;incredible. Mcree.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; is maybe the best fig in .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;the set. He is also the.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;only one with leg .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; printing. Reaper is .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; maybe one of the most .&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;epic figs I&nbsp;have now.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; between the trench.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; coat and the awesome.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; printing he looks pretty.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; sick.</p>

<p>The pros: details</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Great figs</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Awesome build</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Good part selection</p>

<p>Cons.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;: mcree&#39;s hand should be.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;dual molded&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To many pros???</p>

<p>Verdict: i would recommend this.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; set if you have any.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; interest in overwach, old.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; trucks, or spanish.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; architecture.&nbsp;</p>

"Faefrost","2019-01-21T06:50:40.42Z","Best value Overwatch set","<p>This might be the best Overwatch set of this initial wave. Just based on pure value and play capabilities. The set is a nice inexpensive $29 USD. That gives you three desirable minifigs. A nice well presented Hover Truck, with the mission payload. And a nice playable piece of scenery, All for under $30.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Box/Instructions - The boxes look nice. They are that clean yellow and grey Overwatch&nbsp;style. Both front and back give a clear impression of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs - The set has three excellent Minifigs. Some real popular fan fav characters.</p>

<p>McCree - Overwatch&#39;s&nbsp;2 gun cowboy mercenary is well executed. He is well printed with a nice cloth poncho. He comes with both his cowboy hat and an alternate longish hair. His weapons are two &quot;old style&quot; revolvers. That is a little disapointing. He would have benefited from the Lone Ranger gun mold.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Reaper - This is the cheapest way to get Reaper. He is in his standard leged form. Nice front and back printing. A nice cloth caps. A pair of brick built pistols, Just a gorgeous figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Soldier 76 - A nice colorful figure, with a brick built energy rifle. He is the most colorful and most disapointing&nbsp;figure in the set. But he&#39;s still really nice. No baddies here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts - Parts provided are quite interesting. Nothing extraordinary, but some stuff in a nice mexican building color scheme.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build/Model - The set breaks down into three models. A small fruit stand with a string of overhead lights, complete with Diablo Pinata. An amazing Hover Truck, and a shallow building frontage in a nice Mexican / TexMex style.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overview - FANTASTIC! The truck is great. It&#39;s just a flatbed utility truck. But it works so well, with hidden rollers, The Dorado building facade looks great. It has some nice environmental areas for staging Overwatch&nbsp;matches. Or it has potential to expand out to a full building.&nbsp; This is a great set. One of the best Overwatch&nbsp;sets.&nbsp;</p>
