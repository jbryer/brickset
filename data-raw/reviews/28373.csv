"Faefrost","2019-01-26T05:27:47.167Z","Surprisingly fun set, just expensive for what it is","<p>I wasn&#39;t expecting to like this set. I am a bit burned out on mechs. Ninja Mechs, Batmechs, EggMechs, Giant Monkey Mechs, etc. I could go a long time before building another Lego Mech suit... yet here we are. And they are quite good and compelling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box\Instructions - Standard Overwatch&nbsp;box. You cant tell box front from back. Front is daylight picture of the mechs&nbsp;fighting, back is nightime view of same. Each done up as the box front. You get two Instruction books and a massive sticker sheet. You will be using it, the robots dont look right without it.</p>

<p>Minifigs&nbsp;- Just 2</p>

<p>Hanna Song - Aka D.Va!!! The most wildly popular character in game and out. Easily the #1 best Overwatch&nbsp;minifig. You bought this set for her and her alone. And she delivers. Front Back and Leg printing. Very Bright Very detailedHer&nbsp;two sided face has her cheery winking pose and her blowing a bubblegum bubble. She carries a unique pink pistol, and has a character unique headpiece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rektor&nbsp;- Unmounted Rektor&nbsp;has some distinct detailing His silver torso and legs, the torso has decent Iron Man style power armor printing. He has the most heartbreaking helmet ever released in Lego. Yes gentle fans, Overwatches Rektor&nbsp;seemingly got the never released Sauron&nbsp;Helmet from LOTR. To the wailing of literally hundreds of LotR fanboys melting down and shriveling up. Under his helmey he has a visored face and a regular face. The normal face includes a long white hairpiece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build/Models - You build two Mech suits. Rektors&nbsp;silver and grey&nbsp;suit. And D.Va&#39;s Pink Bunny Meka suit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rektor&#39;s&nbsp;is an interesting built a good solid learning experience. And looks and moves great. A bit overscale compared to the game but it works well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>D.Va&#39;s Bunny&nbsp;Bot is a deep fun build. Not much in articulation, but lots of weapons and play value. The green canopy gives it a striking look. It is weird how she pilots it laying down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this is a must have. D.Va is the most popular character. Rektor&nbsp;is up there. Especially with many support staff missing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only minor complaint is the scene has no location bits. No targets or objectives But still a solid set</p>

"WaterBlazek","2019-08-15T12:35:55.32Z","Probably best Overwatch Wave 1 set","<p>This set is much more fun than I first expected. Has a great play value of two similar-sized characters (if D.va is in mech).</p>

<p>The minifigures are incredible and I really love the inclusion of Reinhardt as a minifigure.</p>

<p>My two biggest complains would probably be posability of Reinhardt and stickers.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not complaining about knee joints, as Lego almost never includes them, but at least some idea of slightly bent knees would be great.</p>

<p>Also I wish his arms were more posable.</p>

<p>As for the stickers - I get it - they add texture and make D.va&#39;s mech more accurate, so I guess it&#39;s not that bad.</p>

<p>But still, I got to say, this is easily the best Overwatch set&nbsp;in my opinion, you get great play value for great price</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-01-01T20:23:06.603Z","LEGO Mecha Never Disappoints.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #75973 D.Va &amp; Reinhardt:</b> LEGO has taken up some interesting Themes over the course of the past several years, some of them are linked to popular Video Game franchises. Minecraft, Portal 2, Sonic the Hedgehog and the like. Overwatch is the latest in that line of Themes and it is one I am unfamiliar with the Source material as I do not own the title in question, but am aware of its popularity. So forgive me if I come off as uninformed.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: The packaging design for Overwatch more than likely evokes some element of the game with its rich and diverse colour scheme, I wouldn&rsquo;t know, but what I do know is that it stands out on the shelf. It also features extensive imagery of the set, both physical and artistic and has a wrap-around effect. What this means is that both the front and back show the logo and the set, but the designs reflect two separate battlegrounds from the game, one at night and one during the day.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Overall it&rsquo;s a very impressive packaging design and somewhat more involved than other Themes I&rsquo;ve purchased sets from.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: You get two numbered manuals in this set for each character and their mech&rsquo;s build. Each manual has detailed and easy to follow build instructions for one of the two models. There is also a sticker sheet included for the numerous details seen on the models.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is loaded with joints and elements for building a Mech or two. You also get quite a lot of pink, some not so easy to come by in that colour even in the Friends line from what little I&rsquo;ve seen. There&rsquo;s a few new elements too, a unique pistol accessory item for D.Va and some new printed single studs representing some kind of weapon that Reinhardt uses. (I think they&rsquo;re mines or grenades of some kind.) You&rsquo;ll also find four of the 1x1 stud on top stud on the side tile/plate elements, which are relatively new to LEGO and allow for some pretty nifty build techniques.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">D.Va: One of the popular characters from the game, as far as I can deduce, D.Va&rsquo;s Minifigure is a very detailed one. She features some printing on her legs, but the torso print is much more detailed with little tech elements on her front and some more advanced designs on her back. Her head includes two facial expressions, one winking with a smile and the other blowing a bubble of gum.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">For accessories she&rsquo;s carrying a new element sculpted in the shape of an Overwatch pistol weapon of some kind. It features four attachment points and you can build it up into anything you can imagine, it&rsquo;s also pink&hellip; extremely versatile for MOC fans looking for new pieces to play around with. She also includes a very unique hair sculpt.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Reinhardt: Reinhardt reminds me of a silver version of Iron Man. His legs have no printing, but his torso is very detailed with armor printing and a large energy core on his back. His head has two prints, the one side is a stern looking regular facial print which is when he&rsquo;s not wearing his helmet, he includes a white hair piece to complete the look and hide the secondary print.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">He includes a small hammer build and a printed 1x1 tile which kind of reminds me of a Thermal Detonator, but is probably some kind of game specific item. Possibly a power up.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">His second facial expression is a blank tech mask which gives a real Iron Man vibe. Slide the Sauron looking helmet over his head to complete the look of his Mech Piloting form. Overall Reinhardt is very impressive, and definitely loads of fun.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Here you start out building the mech&rsquo;s torso with legs and Reinhardt. This is a relatively straight forward build, the legs are repetitive as you&rsquo;d expect building a pair of legs for a giant attack robot. This build uses some sticker detailing, nothing that is difficult or requires assistance to apply, so you can get this build done fairly quickly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: You finish Reinhardt&rsquo;s mech with this bag by building the arms, massive hammer and that&rsquo;s finished. Again some repetitive steps with the arms as they are mirror opposites of one another, here you will be applying more stickers on the arms, this time younger builders might need some help in getting them on properly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: D.Va and her entire Mech are included inside this bag, there will be a lot more sticker applications here and the model is vastly different from other mecha designs so this build is very different from Reinhardt&rsquo;s and uses a lot of pink. More pink than I&rsquo;ve ever seen in a robotic design. I found this build to be highly satisfying.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">D.Va&rsquo;s Mech: This primarily pink mech model is fairly impressive in design and loaded with stickered details including the Blizzard name. This is probably accurate to the game, again I would not know completely as I don&rsquo;t actually play Overwatch. But LEGO Overwatch is a fun looking Theme and has some unique and impressive designs.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The legs and arms have a fairly decent range of motion, and the model has built-in stud shooters for battle action. The only truly unfortunate design aspect of the model is the cockpit, the two portions which open up in front to fit the Minifigure in suffer as they are not solidly in place and can be push out of alignment far too easily. Overall though, as a LEGO model, it&rsquo;s really impressive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Reinhardt&rsquo;s Mech: Stands imposingly on a shelf, or can fight against D.Va&rsquo;s mech with a massive hammer. You can modify the smaller Minifigure hammer accessory and attach it to the larger brick-built mech model to complete the look.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">For mobility Reinhardt can bend his legs very well, his hips have a full range of motion while his ankles can be position for wide stances. The upper torso of the mech design is a tad weaker, the shoulder joints work somewhat well, though the shoulder pads do limit the range slightly. The elbows are hinged and so suffer more limitations for any kind of action poses. He can&rsquo;t duel-wield the hammer after all, the torso is too large in front keeping him from attaching both handle sections.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Overall though both models are very well implemented, it is just unfortunate that you can only achieve some poses with them for fun action shots.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This was a very interesting set to build and cover. Much like Minecraft before it I am not familiar with the source material, but I love a good LEGO set and I feel that Overwatch as a LEGO Theme offers some interesting new builds and some fun elements that fans of the game and fans of LEGO in general will like. The characters are fun and look great with interesting new parts and excellent prints. The models stand out as something clever and unique.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Overall I would recommend this set. It&rsquo;s a good product and I actually don&rsquo;t think you need to know anything about the games to enjoy it. Recommended.</p>
