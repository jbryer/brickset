It’s actually a problem solving game (and I really like problem solving games :oD). You start off just playing with direction tiles, gradually getting pieces that let you jump, slide down, climb up. It’s not until you get to Radia that it gets really interesting. From there you have to make precise placing to open the next door. Then you have to have power sources. We go on getting into electricity, motors and ropes, all the time your dodging Ogel’s guards and hoping that the next mission doesn't have a lurcher drone in it.
Oh by the way, there’s a big surprise for you when you finish the doom room, I can't spoil it but it makes me think we are going to have another Alpha Team theme (underground?).

"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-25T15:19:16Z","This game is great!","Dash, the leader of the Alpha Team, must rescue his friends from the clutches of Ogel and stop Ogel's scheme for world domination. As you progress through this game and rescue different team members, you get different tools to help you through Ogel's lairs. The game really gets interesting after you get Radia. The locks on the doors change throughout the game. There is a surprise after you shut down the D.O.O.M. machine. This overall recieves from me 10/10. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
