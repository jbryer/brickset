<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>This set has just the normal plain and simple box. It shows some features for the set on the back, and does have a punch tab on the bottom. Instructions are normal and get the job done.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>This set has a lot of nice plates and tiles. The sand green pieces are great (who dosn&#39;t love sand green), and I love the few orange tiles for the hair. The faces for Alex and the chicken are printed, and are not stickers! But, the main piece that sicks out ot most people is the sword. It is a very odd piece, and is likely not going to be used outside of BigFig Minecraft sets. It is still cool to have though. Although I do not know what I&nbsp; could use it for, I love it!</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>There are no minifigures in this set.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was mainly just stacking plates and a couple bricks here and there. To connect the arms, technic pins were used. The right arm contains a friction pin, while the left has a non friction pin (which I will get to later). I absolutely love the chicken, it is so proportionally correct!</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>Since I am an AFOL, I do not intend to play with this set. But, it does feature a lot of playability. The legs are securely connected, but poseable to match how the character walks in-game. The head can also also swivel around, and if you have the pieces for it (or the Skeleton BigFig set), you could even make a helmet that attaches onto two studs on the head! The arms do move up and down to. However, the left arm will not pose because of the non friction technic pin. This is because on the back of the model, there are a couple small liftarm pieces sticking out (not very far), and when you push it down, the left arm moves up. With the sword in this hand, you can push down repeatedly and make it look like Alex is attacking something. While I understand the reasoning behind it, I would have preferred a friction pin. However, this set was made for play, not display, so if I hated it that bad it is an easy fix. One other aspect of the set I am not a huge fan of is the backside. The back is completely antistuds. But, I have no intention of displaying it from the back, so it is not that big of a deal.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>I love the game Minecraft, and of course, LEGO, so when the BigFig line was announced, I was excited. I knew I would use these sets for display, and I was not disappointed. Despite the fact that this set was designed for play and successfully featured many playability options, it also makes a great display set. The proportions for Alex and the chicken are almost exact, and would make a nice addition to anybody&#39;s gaming setup.</p>
