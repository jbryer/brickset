<p>This is an example of a perfect Lego Set.</p>

<p>The price is absolutely worth it. The parts are great, which are used for the Ender Dragon and the End section. The building experience was awesome. The playability gets a lot of points due to the Ender Dragon being able to shoot spring-loaded misses in a way that won&#39;t lose them or shoot them easily. The movement is also great for the Ender Dragon.</p>
