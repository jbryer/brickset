<p>PRICING AND PACKAGE</p>

<p>i found this set at the only place that restocked during the aftermath of the holidays, Barnes and nobles always had stuff early and usually i get my first medium LEGO minecraft set in early January or very late December, this set costed me the sum of 39.99 USD and i say this set came in a good package, thicker than the nether portal set and had better detail. this set came with 386 pieces and comes with 6 mini figures</p>

<p>MINIFIGURES</p>

<p><strong>Alex: </strong>the alternative female skin you can get, in this set though she is shown in a boat and as with most of the recent boats it comes with 2 shovels to be used as paddles... least interesting character in the set</p>

<p><strong>pirate guy?: </strong>when i first heard of this sets existence i did not think they would add a unique skin in this and unlike the end battle which i saw also at Barnes this set does not have a skin code... his accessory is a gold sword&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>zombie with a side of crispy-ness:</strong><strong> </strong>this zombie is on fire! literally, the new piece that can be removed from the legs can fit all of the minifig style legs, the skeleton and other players...</p>

<p><strong>parrot: </strong>an welcome addition to the minecraft theme, what i became surprised about was the illegal technique used for the tail that i did not think LEGO would even attempt to use, the head is a new piece and the entire body is brick built as my original thought was the entire body would be a new mold</p>

<p><strong>turtle: </strong>now its cool seeing the new 1.13 creature but the head was a major disappoint with it using tiles and a tube thing, it would need a better mold to look much more accurate<strong> </strong></p>

<p><strong>dolphin: </strong>a bit big and larger than the in game version... posable flippers and tail... the eyes are printed on 2*1*3 bricks...</p>

<p><strong>fish:</strong> a classic leo style fish, nothing special other than it being orange and after 1.13 i can not tell if its meant to be a mob or and item</p>

<p>BUILDING</p>

<p>this took me 2 hours [mainly because i was watching a movie during building with my parents] and when i was done i experience a weird and cool building strategies and i enjoyed every bit of it. first bag had the figures and other miscellaneous blocks like tnt and gold ore or the chest... the second bag is much better and you build the ship which has a cool feature which i will mention in a moment. and the third bag has the little island which is in sync with the pirate ships feature...</p>

<p>PLAYBUILITY: the ship can spit in 3 sections, the front of the ship the middle with the sail and the rear with the &quot;cannons&quot;... they can be rearranged or if you buy more of the sets you can make a larger ship, the middle section has a feature where you have a plank that you press and it can switch from both sides, the rear has a flick fire missiles. the island can snap in with the boat creating a ship wreak or a pirate island home. the sail as a spot for the parrot and what suprised me is the jolly roger flag is a banner and can put on the stands for the banners! there is gold ore that can be removed and placed anywhere...</p>

<p>FINAL VERDICT</p>

<p>this set is a great set, the new 1.13 mobs [excluding the fish] and the parrot made me really happy for this set, my improvents would be to replace the gold ore that is included with coal or an ore thats near the surface... its cool to get another boat with the boat, a cool mini battle diorama or just a good toy... hopefully you found this usefully and enjoy your day!</p>

"Natethegreat101","2019-03-12T15:58:12.177Z","Exactly What Minecraft Is All About","<p>Many continue to wonder why&nbsp;LEGO Minecraft has been able to succeed for 5 years now. Having played the game myself, I can safely say that both inspire creativity, and this is probably one of the best examples the LEGO designers have come up with for a Minecraft set. This set effectively makes use of an idea someone came up with to make in game and perfectly takes that same idea and turns it into a physical product.</p>

<p>Even though the build was pretty basic, it was quite fun to put together. Just like 21140 Chicken Coop, the designers took the approach of making a player made&nbsp;pirate ship. Not only is this pirate ship accurate to the source material in its blocky look, but it even has 2 play features:</p>

<ul>
	<li>a functioning &#39;walk the plank&#39; play feature.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>working dispensers that shoot arrows by making use of flick-fire missile pieces.</li>
</ul>

<p>We get not one new mob, but three in one set. A parrot, dolphin and turtle are all included in the same set. On top of that, we get a brand new mold designed for mobs that catch on fire&nbsp;thanks to sunlight - if they don&#39;t have a helmet.</p>

<p>A cove area,&nbsp;which is actually bigger than I expected it to be, is also included. This opens up more play features by:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Dock the pirate ship by the use of&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4533772/brick-1x1-w-holder-h0rizontal"">Brick 1X1 W/Holder, H0Rizontal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6234272/brick-1x2-w-3-2-shaft-vert-end"">Brick 1X2, W/ 3.2 Shaft, Vert. End</a>&nbsp;which both blend in to their respective surrounding colors.</li>
	<li>Use the small boat, made out of birch wood, to go into areas where the pirate ship can&#39;t. 2 wooden shovels, which represent oars are included.</li>
	<li>Protecting the turtle eggs from&nbsp;the zombie. (Zombies attack turtle eggs in game if left undefended.)&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Finding the gold ore and&nbsp;treasure chest hidden within the cove.</li>
</ul>

<p>Really my only disappointment with this set is that we&nbsp;get another Alex minifigure, but at least the pirate skin is new.</p>

<p>As for the parts, there&#39;s some new, rare, and as of the&nbsp;writing of this review,&nbsp;exclusive parts to this set. (I&#39;ve included the spares into the count)</p>

<ul>
	<li>4 Bright Green 1x1 Plate&nbsp;with Holder Vertical</li>
	<li>4 Bright Green 1x2 Tile</li>
	<li>2 Dark Bluish Gray 1x2 Plate with Vertical Tube</li>
	<li>2 Nougat 2x4 tile</li>
	<li>2 Light Bluish Gray 1x1 Angular Plate&nbsp;Downwards</li>
	<li>8 Reddish Brown 1x2 Brick with Groove</li>
	<li>4 Dark Tan 1x2 Angular Plate Upwards</li>
	<li>1&nbsp;Gold 2x2&nbsp;Brick</li>
	<li>4 White 1x1 Plate w/ Black Stripe in Center</li>
	<li>1 Green 3x3 plate</li>
	<li>4 Green 1x1 round plate with 3.2 shaft</li>
	<li>1 Dark Orange Flower Stalk with shafts</li>
</ul>

<p>It is also worth mentioning that two Minecraft&nbsp;skeleton heads are included as&nbsp;decoration along with a skeleton head and crossbones banner.</p>
