This Samurai X mech is one great addition, building is good, but details are even better. Minifigs&nbsp;included are superb.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Personally I think it offers great value for what I paid plus at last the chance of having it</p>

"VerMonster","2019-02-09T01:41:24.293Z","Not as awe inspiring as the origional, but it feels like the other series mechs. ","<p>So... There has been a lot of complaining that it isn&#39;t as good as the much larger, much more detailed and much more expensive original version from several years ago. Which I passed on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The origional&nbsp;version of this felt out of place, it was too detailed. Too big. Now that we have the movie sets, it feels like it has more in common with the movie fire mech, or the quake or the dragon mech. The origional firemech was about this size, and about this complex. As I recall, Nya built the mech in the junkyard. This has the feel of a junkyard mech. I&#39;m probably going to do something to put a dome on here, and maybe make the jump pack a little more obvious, but I&#39;d rather MOC up than MOC down.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And it&#39;s cheap enough that I&#39;ll probably get a second. Outside of the Ninjago&nbsp;universe, two or three of these would make great &quot;big muscle&quot; exoframes&nbsp;for a minifig&nbsp;army. I mostly use my minifigs&nbsp;for props for table top RPGs, so there is actually a minifig army.&nbsp;And I can get the parts in any color under the sun if I want to do that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know there is a hub-bub about the skeletons, as well. I haven&#39;t seen the origionals, but I gather the mohawk was molded into one of them? Thats a whole &#39;nother mold. I can&#39;t blame TLG for simplifying their production. This gives us something other than normal 10mm skeleton head, so it will be sticking around longer. I like the alternative, particularly since it gives me two &quot;leader&quot; skeletons at the front of a pack of a dozen of them.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-01-01T13:51:05.263Z","A Legacy Upheld.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #70665 The Samurai Mech:</b> Ninjago Legacy continues to impress with this wonderfully little set involving the recreation of Nya&rsquo;s Samurai X Mech. This little set was released in 2019 and is difficult to find at retail these days, but it&rsquo;s definitely a great little set and I will explain why during this review.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The box shows the three Minifigures on the front without name call outs. It says Featured in Season 1 and has an action shot on the front of the set, the side shows Nya holding two blades in a digital art pose while the back includes shots of the features of the set and animation still images from the cartoon model, which is not based on this model sadly. This is a re-imagined model after all.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual included is actually quite large and folded in half. The set build includes some stickers, so a sticker sheet is also included here. The manual is easy to follow along with, there is also a QR code on the front.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">You will find a number of commonly found Ninjago elements in this set, many familiar to fans of the theme. Also Mixel Ball and Socket joints.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kruncha: This version of the character is only found in this set as the Legacy version, with some familiar printing on his torso to capture the unique look of the Skullkin, this version hasn&rsquo;t changed a whole lot from the original, aside from, I believe the legs being made different. He has a large scimitar weapon and his familiar shoulder armor and helmet.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Nuckal: This Legacy version is a brand new re-use of parts that haven&rsquo;t been seen in a while for the Ninjago line. The print detailing is limited, but the figure looks very good and is a nice re-release. I never managed to get the Skullkins so it&rsquo;s nice to have some of them now. Pretty decent looking Mohawk, a great bone axe and the same shoulder armor as Kruncha.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Samurai X: Legacy Nya in her Samurai X attire is brand new for this set as well, featuring unique print designs on her torso and legs and the dual-sided head from The LEGO Ninjago Movie version of Nya. She does not include an alternate hair piece unfortunately, so is permanently dressed in her helmet and armour. She also does not include any accessories, since the model itself serves as her weapon.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The model is built in many familiar steps for small mecha, including mirrored builds for the arms and legs, all of the steps are easy enough to follow with and even the placement of stickers is not too terribly difficult. This build can be finished in roughly thirty minutes allowing for quick and simple builds, at least for this AFOL&hellip; admittedly some younger builders might not be as adept as myself or nimble with the fingers, but still it shouldn&rsquo;t&rsquo; be too long before you are having numerous adventures with your Samurai Mech and the included Minifigures.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This Legacy Version of the Samurai Mech is much, much smaller. It features Mixel joints and isn&rsquo;t a massive weapon of Skullkin busting devastation, but is very decent for what it is. I like the streamlined design of this model and the use of Mixel joints is very well designed. There&rsquo;s some stickers everywhere for the detailing, some stud launchers, a large sword and two katana for an arsenal. The flag on the back is also here, which again, is a sticker. Far too many stickers though. This model also doesn&rsquo;t have knees, instead the ankles are where the joints are, which slightly limits the poses you can have.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is a very nice re-imagining of a Legacy set. It&rsquo;s smaller, cheaper and more affordable than the original and includes some decent design choices. I actually like the look of this model compared to the original I never picked up, giant mecha are all well and good, but sometimes the scale and size of a Big Fig equivalent works out well too. If you missed out on this set I would recommend tracking it down, especially if you are interested in a complete Legacy collection of LEGO Ninjago. The character choices here are nice as well, with more Skullkins back to do battle against the Ninja. Recommended.</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2020-11-20T16:47:39.52Z","A Surprisingly Great Reimagining of a Classic Ninjago Mech","<p>Legacy is a phenomenal subtheme that gives newer fans of Ninjago (like me) a chance to get sets they missed out on or OG fans a new and often superior design from the original sets. The sets that the Legacy waves have been offering us are unique updates to the original sets that they&rsquo;re based off of. The Samurai Mech is one of those updates that looks SIGNIFICANTLY different from the original mech it&rsquo;s reimagining, with a very downsized design that may disappoint some, but IMO works great as both a reimagining of the Samurai Mech and simply as a mech in itself.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p><b>The Samurai Mech:</b> The only build in the set is the mech, and it&rsquo;s one that really impresses me. Before I take a look at the build, let me just point out that this rendition of the Samurai Mech is loosely based off the original set from 2012 (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/9448-1/Samurai-Mech"">9448</a>) and more so inspired by the design in the Tales from the Monastery of Spinjitzu shorts in an episode titled &ldquo;Samurai X-treme&rdquo;, this explains the difference in size between this version and the original one. The odd thing about the mech though is that it doesn&rsquo;t exactly look completely accurate to the appearance of the mech in the short, but it honestly doesn&rsquo;t bother me at all. Let&rsquo;s start off with the legs and work our way to the top. The legs use 2 points of articulation using mini ball joints and they&rsquo;re really good for putting this mech in many different dynamic poses with good stability. A sticker to represent the armor of the mech can be found at the crotch, and above that is the cockpit hatch that has a 2 by 2 circular tile with a sticker of the Phoenix logo on it and the hatch itself is attached to the mech pretty loosely and it tends to bend down easily when you rotate the arms upward, which I don&rsquo;t like and it&rsquo;s probably my only gripe with the build. The cockpit itself just uses studs to stand the driver, and it&lsquo;s very easy to place a figure there. Behind the cockpit, there&rsquo;s 2 stud shooters (which were a decent substitute to the full sized cannons on the original) and a flag with stickers of the Samurai X logo on both sides of the piece. The arms use quite a few mini ball joints on it which gives them really good range of movement, they also use stickers on the shoulder area for more of the armor design. The right hand of the mech has a clip to hold a big built up sword which is the main weapon of the mech and I really liked the size of the sword where it looks perfect for the vehicle size and was a pretty clever build in general. The left hand has clips to hold onto 2 gold katanas which serve as more weapons for the mech and also doubles as removable weapons to give to Nya. Overall, other than the flaw with the cockpit hatch, I love this mech, it has great articulation, great details and a good sizing. If you think nothing will ever top the original, that&rsquo;s fine, but if you look at it for what it is, it&rsquo;s a pretty darn good mech and It&rsquo;s honestly a model that&rsquo;s great for both play and display, and I wish Lego would do more mechs with a similar sizing and price to this.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs</h3>

<p><b>Samurai X/Nya:</b> Of course, the set wouldn&rsquo;t be complete without the Samurai herself, this reimagining of the OG Samurai X looks a bit different but still keeps the essence of the original figure. Starting off with the legs, it has continuation of the red armor from the torso and a gold sash on the hip. The torso has the main red samurai armor design that&rsquo;s also printed on the back, the printing looks amazing and it&rsquo;s a shame that it&rsquo;s obscured by the armor piece. One more thing about the torso is that it&rsquo;s different to the one in the Legacy&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71705-1/Destiny-s-Bounty"">Destiny&#39;s Bounty</a>&nbsp;since the one in this set has the Phoenix symbol on the armor and the one in the Bounty has the Samurai X symbol instead, so that makes this version of the warrior exclusive to this set. The Samurai armor piece is included with the figure, which that piece in red only other comes in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70680-1/Monastery-Training"">Monastery Training</a>. The face prints found here is a happy/pleasant open smile and a smirk (which pretty much works as an angry face when you put on the helmet). The helmet is the black Samurai helmet with a red visor and a gold bucket handle piece attached at the clip. Overall, this is a fantastic exclusive figure with great detailing and I&rsquo;m very happy that I got a chance to get a Nya Samurai X in a cheap way.</p>

<p><b>Kruncha:</b> This updated version of the Skulkin general is very different and IMO superior to the original Kruncha. The skeleton body piece has printing of some cracks and a red loincloth, which is an exclusive print to the set. He also has the skeleton arms and legs attached to the body of course. He has a black shoulder armor piece which definitely makes the figure look better and more complete. Now the head is a new mold introduced with the Skulkin figures of the Legacy line, and they&rsquo;re fantastic! It&rsquo;s a very well made piece, and you could fit a bunch of hat pieces onto it. As for the printing, there&rsquo;s a crack on the chin, a missing tooth and red eyes, which is just some phenomenal printing, and this face print is only other found in the<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70670-1/Monastery-of-Spinjitzu"">&nbsp;Monastery of Spinjitzu</a>. A samurai helmet in black is used for the headgear of this figure, and it&rsquo;s very interesting to see how it was able to fit on the new skull piece. Finally, his accessory is a scimitar in dark tan. Overall, I really like the execution of the figure, the new skull piece is awesome and so is the printing. I definitely much prefer this Kruncha to the original, since this rendition looks more Lego like, which is a great thing.</p>

<p><b>Nuckal: </b>Nuckal is a bit similar to his pal Kruncha in appearance, but there&rsquo;s still some defining features to be found that helps to distinguish him from the other Skulkin general. The skeleton body piece is basically the same as Kruncha&rsquo;s except with a blue loincloth instead, which that print only other appears in the Monastery of Spinjitzu, and of course, skeletons arms and legs are attached to the body. Nuckal uses the same black shoulder armor piece as Kruncha, and again, makes the figure look more complete. The skull piece here uses a different and exclusive print, with no missing tooth, one red eye and a silver eye patch on the right eye, yet again, some amazing printing. As for what&rsquo;s attached to his head, a tan Mohawk (which is exclusive to the set) is used and it really gives him a wild look. Finally, his accessory is a bone axe, which was a nice built up weapon. Overall, my thoughts about him are the same as my opinions on Kruncha and the Legacy Skulkin figures in general, he&rsquo;s an improvement over the original and definitely a very collectible figure.</p>

<h3>Value for Money</h3>

<p>So, 15 bucks... is that a good price for the set? To that I&rsquo;ll answer with a simple &ldquo;sure&rdquo;. The mech and the Nya figure together feels like it could be sold for 10 bucks, add in 2 Skulkin figures in there, and you got a 15 dollar set. If I had to briefly describe the value of the set, I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s a fair price and it&rsquo;s pretty recommendable at full price honestly.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>The build IMO works really well as a reimagining of the Samurai Mech that has great aspects to it and it&rsquo;s a fun build that&rsquo;s worthy of my praise (even with that one flaw). The 3 exclusive figures are fantastic as well with a really good selection, the 2 Skulkin generals in particular were very welcome inclusions, I&rsquo;m really glad that the wacky duo were put into such a cheap set since they were kind of cameo characters in the earlier seasons of the show, and Legacy Samurai X Nya was an awesome and welcome update to the original. The value is pretty good and definitely in an affordable price range if you&rsquo;re not looking for an expensive set. If you&rsquo;re a Ninjago fan, definitely don&rsquo;t miss out on this set, and if you&rsquo;re just a Lego fan in general, it&rsquo;s still worth your time and money to check it out. I&rsquo;d give this set a 9/10 overall and I highly recommend you to get it before it retires which is happening soon.</p>
