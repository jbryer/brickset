<p>I think many people will have been overjoyed with the announcement that one of the sets&nbsp;to be re-imagined for the Ninjago&nbsp;Legacy series was <strong>set 70503 The Golden Dragon</strong>. The original 2013 set cost 30 euros, and was 252 pieces. It has proven popular, and the cheapest new sets are now listed on Brick Link for 110 euros. Second hand sets start at 40 euros, and go up from there.</p>

<p>This set, the re-imagined Golden Dragon, is 171 pieces, and sells for 20 euros. In many ways it seems a near perfect scale down of the original: 2/3 of the price, 2/3rd of the pieces, and roughly 2/3 of the size. Where this set definitely beats its illustrious predecessor, is in the minifigures. The Golden Ninja (Lloyd) and the Stone Army Scout&nbsp;are nice, but the third one - Overlord/Garmadon&nbsp;- IMHO is a serious candidate for minifigure of the year!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build of the dragon is nice. Due to all the mixel-style ball joints, the dragon has great posability. Getting it to stand solidly on the ground is a bit tricky as a result. There is a new two-piece dragon head, which now shoots studs rather than balls. It is a new element, and IMHO the head is now far more in proportion to the rest of the dragon.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this set is a great gift, has great value for money, and is a fun little dragon to be proud off. I would highly recommend it.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>This build is a very simple build. There are a few stickers that are easy to apply; these stickers do enhance the looks of the dragon though. The two truly special pieces are the two parts for the dragon&#39;s head. Some elements might be a re-colour, but I saw no special pieces. Overall, it should take no more than 20 minutes or so to build the set.</p>

<p>Smartly - for such a small dragon - the designer has been able to restrain himself, and has not included some truly off-colour&nbsp;bricks. As a result, there are no ugly bright colours&nbsp;peeking through at any angles. The one decision I am not too sure what to think of, is the decision to build the feet with bricks rather than claw-pieces. On the other hand, the use of claw piece would have resulted in some visible technic elements.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are three minifigures included in this set, and all of them are unique (so far) to this set.</p>

<p>The Stone Army Scout&#39;s uniqueness is in his weapon.&nbsp;The print and mini-legs. The torso print&nbsp; seems to&nbsp;shared with other Stone Army minifigures. It is nicely detailed and well executed.</p>

<p>The Golden Ninja (Lloyd) has a very nice, highly detailed print on the front and back of the torso, with many gold-on-pearl-gold print, combined with dark forest-green. The front torso print is nicely continued on the legs. I like his two facial expressions (determined and angry), and think the green eyes add a lot.</p>

<p>The star minifigure of this set - beyond any doubt - is Overlord (who has taken over Lord Garmadon&#39;s body). The choice to use the trans-purple and black footing first introduced in the Ghost Army minifigures (where it was blue and trans-yellow) the design of the two torso pieces as well as the trans-purple head with awesome evil face print... the set is almost worth buying for this minifigure alone; the minifig is listed on BrickLink for 4.62 euros already (while the set has just been launched)!&nbsp;The purple lower torso print provides a nice sublte detail, and the gold-armour with bright pink/purple &#39;evil energy&#39; running down the centre... gorgeous. The face print is very detailed, and the colour&nbsp;of the eyes, facial expression and metallic teeth make for a truly evil character.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>This Golden Dragon seems to be the second smallest of all the dragon-based&nbsp;boxed Ninjago&nbsp;sets. Only <strong>Cole&#39;s Dragon (set 70599)</strong> is smaller (about 2/3 of the size) than this one. Despite its small size, it looks finished, and like a complete dragon.&nbsp; There is nothing awkward about it, as long as you accept the skeletal nature of the wings (just as with the original).&nbsp;</p>

<p>As mentioned previously, this set is very much a downsizing of the original to 2/3&#39;s the original size. There are only two claws at the end of the wings, for instance. But merely considering this a mere downsizing does not do credit to the designer. I think he has made the right choices in the design of the legs (slightly different from the original), and I like the new design for the head. In general it looks better, but it is also much more in proportion to the body. A very good use is made of pieces that have been created since, like the modified 1x1 plate with the &#39;tooth&#39; pointing down, in gold.</p>

<p>This Golden Dragon is definitely a worthy member of the Ninjago&nbsp;dragon line-up, which stands at 31 (with 28 of them &#39;living&#39; dragons, two mech dragons, and one dragon-head as part of a Spinjitzu&nbsp;game.</p>

<h2>Play or&nbsp;display</h2>

<p>I would rate this set as much a play as a display set. The stud-shooter&nbsp;in the head is definitely a play feature. There are two bad guys to go after. the wings can move, so can the tail. It is very swooshable, and quite easy to hold.</p>

<p>It is also striking enough to be a viable (small) display model. Not only the colours, but the overall looks, it is simply a well designed, well engineered and finished product. The one tricky thing might be to find a stable pose, but there some slight modification and a nice base might do the job.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>This is a top set&nbsp;that definitely surpassed my expectations. It already looks nice, but when put next to its 2013 predecessor it becomes evident what a tremendous job the designer has done, and how good this little set actually is. The mini-figures are excellent, the build is fun, it offers a lot of elements to play with, and all that for a reasonable 20 euros. If you collect Lego dragons, IMHO this is a must have. Similarly, I think it makes for a great gift, with many play possibilities. Its RRP is good, so if you like it, there is no reason not to get this dragon.</p>

"EnergyBlast_Productions","2019-02-07T01:28:06.263Z","This Golden Ninja doesn't need a sword...but his dragon needs some new legs","<p>Of all of the 2019 Legacy remakes that we got this year, the Golden Dragon is probably the one I was most excited for, not just because I got the original one from 2013.&nbsp; Much like the&nbsp;<strong>Throne Room Showdown&nbsp;</strong>or&nbsp;<strong>Ninjago City Chase</strong>, this set is a strong $20 set with a good build and beautiful minifgures.</p>

<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>The set took me around 10-15 minutes to build, with me taking my time.&nbsp; That can be expected for it having just over 150 pieces.&nbsp; Everything fit together fine, and the instructions were easy to follow.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>Golden Ninja Lloyd was my most anticipated figure of this set, because who wouldn&#39;t want this guy?&nbsp; This is the only other time besides 2013 that we&#39;ve gotten an official Golden Ninja minifigure, and this version truly does justice to the character.&nbsp; His accessory is a golden katana, a pretty common piece and not that important in my opinion, since Lloyd doesn&#39;t&nbsp;<em>need a</em>&nbsp;sword.&nbsp; (Yeah, I know, I&#39;m not funny.)&nbsp; He uses the new 2019 style hood piece, which is now one piece again.&nbsp; The face printing is exclusive and is printed onto a golden head, much like with the original.&nbsp; The torso has some really nice shiny gold dragon prints, and the legs bear much resemblance to the original figure.&nbsp; The major change here is the loss of the ZX shoulderpads in gold, since the new hood piece unfortunately restricts giving your ninja any kind of armor piece that overlaps the back or front of the torso.</p>

<p>The Overlord is a pretty dope figure as well, and this is the only other time since 2014 that we&#39;ve gotten a truly official Overlord minifgure.&nbsp; (The 2013 version was literally just Garmadon with a mouthguard.)&nbsp; This version doesn&#39;t necessarily resemble any particular appearance from the show, but rather mixes designs and details from all of his different looks.&nbsp; He&#39;s four armed, ghost-tailed, and he has the Helmet of Shadows.&nbsp; His weapon is a long spear.&nbsp; His face print is a crazy evil snarl printed onto a translucent purple head, which makes the figure that much better.&nbsp; His top torso piece is the same used since some of the 2017 Garmadon minifgures, with printing resembling the Golden Master version.&nbsp; The bottom torso has fairly simple printing, and he uses the ghost tail piece that we&#39;ve gotten for minifigures like Bansha, Nadakhan, and Yang recolored in translucent purple and black.</p>

<p>The Stone Scout is the least exciting minifigure&nbsp;in this set, but it&#39;s not exactly fair competition when you compare him to the other two.&nbsp; He has some really nice printing on his torso, which seems to blend styles from his 2013 and 2016 versions.&nbsp; His weaponry is a gun metal gray crossbow, with a black quiver that the scout can wear with it.&nbsp; His face printing has green face paint, a color we haven&#39;t gotten before and is only otherwise obtainable from&nbsp;<strong>Cole&#39;s Earth Driller.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>The hat is the newer style rice hat that we got in the movie sets recolored in red.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>This version of the Golden Dragon, while it is descaled from it&#39;s original version (which was $10 more expensive) is still a very good representation of the Golden Dragon.&nbsp; My favorite part of it is the plastic head, which is molded after the classic rubber heads that we got with Ninjago dragons back in the day.&nbsp; No longer being rubber, the mouth can actually open and close and there is a stud shooter inside that you can remove if you don&#39;t care for it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wings are similar to the original - large golden blades.&nbsp; They look very nice here and have much better articulation compared to the 2013 dragon.&nbsp; Both wings have claws at the ends to pick up Stone Warriors and hurl&nbsp;them out of the fight.</p>

<p>The main body and saddle are very simply designed.&nbsp; The saddle area is mainly white, with enough room to sit Lloyd, and there&#39;s a nice flag on the back with a sticker on it.&nbsp; The tail is very articulated as well, and has the two katanas on the end just like the original.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The one issue I have with this dragon is the legs, but more specifically the feet.&nbsp; They are so easily moved and so oddly built that the whole thing can easily collapse just by lightly nudging it.&nbsp; Putting the dragon in different positions and stances can be a challenge, as the legs never seem to cooperate.&nbsp; Rather than using normal dragon feet pieces, these are brick-built, and...they don&#39;t look all that great.&nbsp; The toes added don&#39;t do much to help the dragon stand up, and the balance is just so off.&nbsp; If Lego had just used normal dragon foot pieces and gave them the claw pieces that the wings do, this dragon would stand perfectly fine.</p>

<h2>The Price</h2>

<p>Overall, the set is good, it has some great pieces, and the minifigures are phenomenal.&nbsp; This set retails for $20 in the US, which isn&#39;t half bad, considering all you get here.&nbsp; Now, if Lego had made this $15 instead, I think that would have been perfect, but to be fair getting the Golden Ninja and his dragon isn&#39;t anything to common, so I understand why Lego may put a bit more value on this one.&nbsp; The fact alone that they put two beloved and coveted characters like the Golden Ninja and the Overlord together in a $20 set is fantastic, and if you&#39;re a Ninjago fan especially, this set is definitely for you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Other than the feet, the dragon is a pretty strong build, and like I said, the minifigures&nbsp;are more than surprising.&nbsp; If you&#39;re only planning on getting a few sets from the Legacy wave, pick this one up.&nbsp; Even if you&#39;re only picking one set up, pick this one up.&nbsp; Lego has really been stepping up their game with $20 Ninjago&nbsp;sets since the movie, and I really hope they keep this up.</p>

"Nat501","2019-08-08T08:12:46.277Z","I picked this up on clearance but would pay full price for it easily ","<p>This is a very good set with lots of playability which is great for younger users. The part selection in this set is spectacular and getting a molded dragon head instead of the usual brick built ones is nice as well. The real highlight of the set though are the Minifigures&nbsp;they are incredibly detailed and a step up from the original.</p>

<p>The only flaw I can find is Lego went and slapped a stud shooter in the mouth&nbsp;</p>
