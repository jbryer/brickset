"EnergyBlast_Productions","2019-01-13T22:19:24.547Z","Another Bike Set...But Surprisingly Good!","<p>Since the<strong> Ninja Bike Chase</strong> set from 2016, it seems like LEGO just continues to release more and more two-bike sets, with this one being the fourth so far. &nbsp;Because it&#39;s not really anything new that we haven&#39;t seen before, many people have decided against getting this set, and my opinions were very similar until picking this up.</p>

<p>As the Ninjago&nbsp;Legacy wave goes, this set is a remake of - not one - but two different sets from 2012 (to an extent.) &nbsp;<strong>Kai&#39;s Blade Cycle</strong>, which was originally one set on its own, and Zane&#39;s Snowmobile, which was a side build included in the <strong>Fangpyre&nbsp;Truck Ambush</strong> set. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Side Builds</h2>

<p>The set also includes a handful of side builds to help really set up a scene, the first and largest one being a tall lamp post similar to the one in&nbsp;<strong>Ninjago City Chase.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;It has a nice sticker on one of the road signs, and there&#39;s a translucent lime green chain attached that the Serpentine can use to....trip the bikes? &nbsp;I&#39;m not really sure.</p>

<p>The next side build is a small shrine holding the Sword of Fire for Kai, which is the same piece we&#39;ve gotten for it since 2011. &nbsp;It includes the snake pieces we got in the Hands of Time wave recolored in purple, which is an awesome inclusion. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The last two builds are a small crate holding a single LEGO dynamite piece, and the other build is one of the Spinjitzu rods that are included in some of the other sets, like&nbsp;<strong>Monastery of Spinjitzu. &nbsp;</strong>It&#39;s actually really fun to play around with, especially when you put one of the seperately sold Spinjitzu spinners on it.</p>

<h2>Kai&#39;s Blade Cycle</h2>

<p>As a bike that really didn&#39;t look much different from Mr. E&#39;s bike from&nbsp;<strong>Street Race of Snake Jaguar,&nbsp;</strong>Kai&#39;s newly remade Blade Cycle actually is a great build that easily surpassed his previous bike from&nbsp;<strong>Ninja Bike Chase.</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s eye-catching, it&#39;s sleek, it&#39;s well-designed, and it drives great. &nbsp;This remake of the Blade Cycle also includes more black, gold, and orange than the original, which I really appreciate since I always felt like the 2012 version almost had too much red. &nbsp;It&#39;s play feature is similar to the original - press something, and blades on both sides of the bike jut out, except here it&#39;s much more practical, and simply looks better. &nbsp;When all the blades are extended, it makes sort of an X shape, and simply look amazing. &nbsp;Say what you want about this bike, but it is NOT a poor remake by any means.</p>

<h2>Zane&#39;s Snowmobile</h2>

<p>As for the remake that the majority of people actually do prefer over the original, Zane&#39;s Snowmobile is simply so great. &nbsp;It&#39;s a bit larger now, more accurate to its size in the show, and has a lot more detail. (though some of it does come from stickers) &nbsp;It&#39;s major color scheme is white, gold, blue, and black. &nbsp;I&#39;m glad they kept the ice element piece on the back for the back of the seat. &nbsp;Speaking of seating, however, Zane doesn&#39;t actually sit on the snowmobile. He stands, and holds on to the handlebars. &nbsp;The main feature of the bike are stud shooters on each side of the snowmobile, which aren&#39;t anything amazing.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>Starting with the Fire Ninja himself, Kai is not exclusive to this set by any means. &nbsp;He comes in four other sets:&nbsp;<strong>Spinjitzu Kai, Monastery Training, Cole&#39;s Earth Driller, </strong>and<strong> Monastery of Spinjitzu</strong>.<strong> &nbsp;</strong>Even despite him being the most common ninja in this wave, he still has some great torso and leg printing. &nbsp;His suit gives me a lot of Kai DX vibes, which is so nice. &nbsp;His hood, like the other ninja&#39;s, is in the new 2019 mold, and it looks great in his two shades of red. &nbsp;His accessory is really just the Sword of Fire, but he may be unarmed if you prefer to keep the sword attached to the shrine. &nbsp;I really wish he had new facial printing.</p>

<p>Zane, the Ninja of Ice, is significantly less common than Kai, as he only comes in two other sets:&nbsp;<strong>Spinjitzu&nbsp;Zane,&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Monastery of Spinjitzu</strong>. &nbsp;His Legacy suits is one of my favorites, with my favorite part being the X design on his torso with the golden dragon printed across. This is also the first time in a while in the TV universe that we&#39;ve gotten a Zane minifigure&nbsp;with no titanium on him. &nbsp;His accessories are his Shurikens of Ice, which are molded in the 2015 design. &nbsp;Really wish they had given him new facial printing, or at least included his Snake Jaguar head to avoid including his creepy smile face from the movie.</p>

<p>Spitta was one of my first Serpentine minifigures, and so I have a lot of nostalgia getting him here. He also is included in&nbsp;<strong>The Ultra Dragon&nbsp;</strong>set.&nbsp;&nbsp;He now has more armor and padding on, which isn&#39;t really something the Serpentine had back in 2012. &nbsp;His head printing is, from what I can tell, the same, and he has the same leg printing as Lasha. &nbsp;His weapon is a scythe.</p>

<p>Lasha, as I said, has the same leg printing, but is still a really cool figure. He is also included in&nbsp;<strong>Jay&#39;s Storm Fighter </strong>and&nbsp;<strong>The Ultra Dragon</strong>. &nbsp;His face printing is a bit...interesting, but still a nice change, and his torso printing is really well done as well. &nbsp;His weapon is a dagger.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall, this set was one that I didn&#39;t expect much from and yet I enjoyed a lot when I was done building. &nbsp;The figures, while none being exclusive, are still really nice, especially since the only other way to get Spitta is in a larger, much more expensive set. &nbsp;Kai&#39;s Blade Cycle is an obvious improvement for me, and the same can be said for Zane&#39;s Snowmobile. &nbsp;This probably holds the title of best bike set for me, and I would definitely recommend picking this up, unless you&#39;re already planning on getting the bigger sets and you don&#39;t care much for bikes. &nbsp;In that case, I would hold off on getting this one.</p>

"tacocat","2021-03-02T09:09:13.757Z","Great Ninjago set","<p>I think this set is pretty good, nostalgic, it has 2 remade minifigures from 2012&nbsp;(Lasha, Spitta), the Kai and Zane suits look simple, but cool.</p>

<p>It has a lot of side builds, it makes it more playable. If there are 2 kids they can build the 2 motorcycles simultaneously build them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ice cycle has only one function (it can shoot blue studs) , so it is not the best part of the set. Kai&#39;s motorcycle has a better function, if you pull 2 levers, swords will swing open.&nbsp;</p>

<p>i would rate this set overall with a 4 stars</p>

The two snakes have wicked new printings, and they look stunning. The Kia fig has been use many times throughout the Legacy wave and is nothing special. I am glad that the Zane fig has a yellow head vs. a silver one. I love the comeback of the Golden Weapons, seeing that I never had any. The side builds are a nice touch. I think both bikes have surpassed their earlier counterparts.Kia&#39;s bike can pop out blades and Zane&#39;s has two hidden stud shooters.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, I think this is great and is price very fairly, which is hard to come by these days.</p>
