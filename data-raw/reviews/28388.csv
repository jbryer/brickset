"CommanderCody05","2023-01-26T18:59:42.47Z","The best Legacy set ever!!!","<p>I bought this set a few weeks after it came out, and it being a set with Cole (he is my favourite character) made it an easy buy.</p>

<p>Stone Warriors:</p>

<p>The minifigures are great, especially the Samurai one. The armour piece on him is cheap looking, so I replaced it with an older variation. The archer was a nice edition, and I made him sport a sword instead of a crossbow. The real prize is the four-armed warrior. He was fun to build and has two swords, but I wish he had one for each hand.There are a few spots were you can see multicoloured pieces.</p>

<p>Ninja:</p>

<p>The Kia figs is the most common one in the wave and is okay. Cole only comes in a few sets and his suit is really detailed. I love the earth colour tones. His driller is equally exceptional. It boasts a functioning drill and is larger than the original. The detailing is superb. The build experience was so great I built it twice!</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>The set was well priced, and the designer did a great job. Seeing that it is retired, it might be hard to come by, but you won&#39;t be disappointed.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading,</p>
