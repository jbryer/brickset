<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>Aside from the individual addon parts used, the build for this spinner is pretty similar to all the rest.&nbsp; There are four of each of the three addons, which means you have to build 12 addons in total, along with the three holder rings.&nbsp; Since I had built 4 other spinners before this, the build didn&#39;t exactly excite me, but this set does have some really nice pieces.</p>

<h2>The Minifigure</h2>

<p>Jay is, of course, the figure included in this spinner, and he is dressed in his 2019 Legacy suit.&nbsp; This version appears in other sets this year:&nbsp;<strong>Jay&#39;s Storm Fighter&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Monastery of Spinjitzu</strong>.&nbsp; He has a really nice blend of colors for his new 2019-style hood piece, and his torso and legs are very well printed with some great gold dragon prints on the torso.&nbsp; His face is the same one we&#39;ve gotten for most Jay minifigures since the TLNM sets, and his accessory is a single silver katana.</p>

<h2>The Spinner</h2>

<p>When I first saw the product images for this set, I was pretty confused with the color choices they went for with Jay&#39;s spinner.&nbsp; The flat blue works fine, but the translucent neon green always looked kinda weird with it.&nbsp; However, after getting the spinner in person, I can honestly say I love it a lot more and it looks really great alongside the other spinners.&nbsp; The spinner itself consists of two pieces: the big dual-molded tornado, and the inverted, rounded, circular piece on the bottom that helps it to spin like a top.</p>

<h2>Attack Addon</h2>

<p>Jay&#39;s attack addon is a really interesting one.&nbsp; It uses blue and yellow pieces with clips to hold four different yellow lightning bolt pieces (such as the ones used in the Nexo Knights sets).&nbsp; Because of the how far they extend from the spinner, it puts a bit too much weight on the spin sometimes, but it looks cool all the same.</p>

<h2>Defense Addon</h2>

<p>Jay&#39;s defense addon uses the most parts out of all three, and consists of individual &quot;shields&quot; basically, each with neon Power Miner crystals on either side.&nbsp; Each of the four shields has a circular tile with Jay&#39;s symbol, which is a piece that has been used before on sets like&nbsp;<strong>Jay - Spinjitzu Master</strong>.&nbsp; The crystals are really awesome pieces, and I was glad to get them in this set.</p>

<h2>Speed Addon</h2>

<p>Jay&#39;s speed addon is identical to that of other spinners - well, the other single $10 spinners at least.&nbsp; It consists of yellow spikes connected to black cylindrical pieces with clips on the other end.&nbsp; This addon is very simple, and I was surprised the spikes were yellow instead of blue, but I guess it&#39;s kinda nice.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall, this spinner is pretty good.&nbsp; I&#39;ve said before how I&#39;m not a huge fan of the price of these spinners, but after collecting almost all of them now, I can say that they really are a lot more fun when you have a whole bunch of them.&nbsp; The parts used in Jay&#39;s spinner are very useful, and I look forward to LEGO possibly using more of this neon green for Jay in the future.</p>
