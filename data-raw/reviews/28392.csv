<h2>The Minifigure</h2>

<p>The Zane minifigure&nbsp;included in this set is the same one found in the following Ninjago&nbsp;Legacy sets:&nbsp;<strong>Kai&#39;s Blade Cycle and Zane&#39;s Snowmobile&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Monastery of Spinjitzu</strong>. &nbsp;He has some great torso and leg printing, and his new hood piece is awesome. &nbsp;His weapon is a single silver katana, which is the same weapon every minifigure has in these Spinner sets unfortunately. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Spinner</h2>

<p>The new spinners comprise of two pieces: the large, dual-molded tornado piece, and the round circular piece on the bottom that allows it to spin. &nbsp;Zane&#39;s spinner is molded in a really nice translucent icy blue and flat white, giving off an awesome ice look. &nbsp;You can easily put Zane inside the spinner by attaching his feet to two studs inside, and he fits in there very snug. &nbsp;The easiest and most effective way to spin it is by holding onto Zane&#39;s head and spinning it that way. It actually spins a lot better than I was expecting, and does much better on its own without the add-ons. &nbsp;It&#39;s a really awesome representation of Spinjitzu&nbsp;in LEGO form, and I love it.</p>

<h2>Attack Add-on</h2>

<p>Zane&#39;s attack add-on comprises of four identacle&nbsp;aeroblade-type&nbsp;weapons that jut out from each side of the spinner. &nbsp;Each add-on also has a circular crown that you can attach the add-ons&nbsp;to when you&#39;re not using them, and they can also hold the spinner up on display. &nbsp;Each aeroblade also has a circular tile with Zane&#39;s symbol printed on, identical to the ones included in sets such as <b>S<strong>treet Race of Snake Jaguar</strong></b>. &nbsp;This is by far the worst add-on to use while spinning, because it seemingly makes it far too heavy on the sides to maintain a lasting spin.</p>

<h2>Speed Add-on</h2>

<p>Zane&#39;s speed add-on is the simplest of the three, but works decently well. &nbsp;Four white spikes attached by clips onto the spinner, and it helps it spin faster, I guess. &nbsp;It looks cool, and isn&#39;t nearly as difficult as the attack add-on.</p>

<h2>Defense Add-on</h2>

<p>Zane&#39;s defense add-on is by far my favorite. &nbsp;Not only does it spin the best out of the three, but it looks great with the spinner. &nbsp;It&#39;s basically four identical ice shards attached to the spinner, all in that great translucent icy blue. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Price</h2>

<p>As great as this spinner is, the price is a bit disappointing. &nbsp;For $10, you do get over 100 parts, but they&#39;re all mostly small pieces except for the spinner, which is still pretty small in comparison to previous spinners like the Airjitzu&nbsp;flyers and Spinjitzu Masters. &nbsp;Honestly, if LEGO had made these $5-$8 instead, I feel like I would be more keen to pick more of these up right away.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><strong>Spinjitzu&nbsp;Zane&nbsp;</strong>is a great spinner set, if not the best out of the four single spinner sets, but as I mentioned the price could easily turn some people away. &nbsp;This set has some great parts, a fantastic figure, but honestly if you&#39;re planning on getting some of the other sets with Zane and you wanna save your $10, I&#39;d say save it, at least until these fall on clearance or something.</p>
