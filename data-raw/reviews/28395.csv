<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>As I&#39;ve said with all of my spinner reviews, the building for each one is very redundant and the speed addon is built exactly the same as Kai, Jay, and Zane&#39;s spinners.&nbsp; There are some really nice pieces here, like the translucent orange cheese slopes, the gray rock pieces, and the circular tiles with Cole&#39;s symbol printed onto them - you get four in this set!&nbsp; I built this set in 7-ish minutes while taking my time.</p>

<h2>The Minifigure</h2>

<p>Cole is of course the ninja included, and he&#39;s sporting his January 2019 Legacy suit, which is included in two other sets in the wave -&nbsp;<strong>Cole&#39;s Earth Driller&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>Monastery of Spinjitzu</strong>.&nbsp; He has sleeves this time around - much different from his several previous outfits from Sons of Garmadon and Hunted - and has the new 2019 hood mold in black with a brown band around the forehead.&nbsp; The printing on his torso and legs is exceptional, with all of the gray, orange, and gold colors working together well on the black torso and legs.&nbsp; His weapon is a single silver katana.</p>

<h2>The Spinner</h2>

<p>Of all the spinners, Cole&#39;s is probably the most different from the show appearance, mainly due to the large amount of orange.&nbsp; The two colors molded into his spinner are orange (duh) and dark translucent gray.&nbsp; It&#39;s a pretty awesome piece, and the rounded tile on the bottom is black.</p>

<h2>Speed Addon</h2>

<p>Like I mentioned, this particular addon is built identical to the other single spinners - just four black clips with holes on the ends, and an orange spike for each.&nbsp; Of all the addons, this one spins the best.</p>

<h2>Defense Addon</h2>

<p>Cole&#39;s defense addon is probably the best-looking of all three, and it&#39;s a pretty simple build.&nbsp; Four identical &quot;shields&quot; built with gray rock pieces, translucent orange cheese slopes, and golden circular tiles with Cole&#39;s symbol printed on.&nbsp; This addon can be a bit awkward to spin with because of it&#39;s size, but it is something you can work around.</p>

<h2>Attack Addon</h2>

<p>Cole&#39;s attack addon is...interesting.&nbsp; I guess they wanted to play off of his sudden use of hammers in more recent waves, and so each individual part of the addon is - you guessed it - a hammer.&nbsp; The hammers themselves are pretty simple builds - black handle, black mallet piece at the top, and translucent orange pieces on the sides and top to give it a finished, sharper look.&nbsp; These hammers are all attached to clip builds.&nbsp; This addon is the most difficult to use, mainly due to it&#39;s size, weight, and how far the hammers stick out from the spinner.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>All in all, Cole&#39;s spinner is one of my favorites that we got this year, mainly because I love the orange colors we get for him now.&nbsp; The Cole minifgure only comes in a $50 set and a $80 set besides this, so the minifigure value is very good.&nbsp; As I mentioned with my Jay spinner review, I&#39;ve grown more fond of these as I collect more of them, and overall Cole&#39;s spinner is a great addition to my collection.</p>

LEGO created new elements and a new way to play to focus on reviving the Spinners idea. It took me a while, but I finally picked one up during Black Friday and now to discuss the new-and-improved Spinners. Are they really improved though?</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The set is packaged in a cardboard sleeve thing similar to the Speedorz packaging from LEGO Legends of Chima and some of the Airjitzu Spinners of recent years. The image on the front reveals Cole in his Ninja Glory and the new Spinner element. The back shows a complete list of all the sets. While this set is not branded as Legacy I would still consider it as part of the Legacy line.</span></span></span></span></p>

This new element is sculpted to resemble the energy tornadoes shown in the cartoon, the piece includes four bars to attach clips onto and a lower end to attach to a reverse round tile so it can spin. This new element is the big selling point of these sets and it looks fairly decent, although it doesn&rsquo;t have a weighted base as the original Spinners had to help keep them upright.</span></span></span></span></p>

The head is a re-use of the Ninjago Movie, which is something they&rsquo;ve been doing since The LEGO Ninjago Movie, for accessories he only comes with a Katana, but that&rsquo;s fine. I love the detailing on this Minifigure, he&rsquo;s really impressive.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">The Spinner</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The new Spinner element was discussed quite thoroughly in the Parts section. So I&rsquo;ll discuss the new play pattern. They&rsquo;ve revived the customization idea here and included three sets of four items to attach to the new Spinner. You build four hammers, four tooth blade things and four larger items which includes four printed round tiles with something associated with the Ninjago language printed on it. I think they were used in the Quake Mech originally, but I&rsquo;m not sure.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The four tooth blade things are part of the Speed section. It is more than likely designed to attack other Spinners faster since the Spinner does spin really fast without anything attached, I assume the others would slow down. The large rocky things with the printed tiles are called Defense, they are more than likely designed to protect your character from other Spinners.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The four hammers are Attack, when attached to the Spinner they will ram into any other Spinner and help to defeat them. Basically it&rsquo;s Rock, Paper, Scissors, but with LEGO.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">You can build three identical base elements which can be used to house the parts when not attached to the Spinner. They are designed in such a fashion that you can attach them all on top of each other and allows the Spinner to sit on a shelf when not being used and display without toppling over. These builds are identical to one another, in fact all of the building in this set is pretty repetitive.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Overall opinion</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">These new Spinners are great, they offer a lot more play options and work really well too. My only complaint is that only the Ninja and Garmadon are available for purchase, the previous Spinner sets include villains for the Ninja to butt heads against. It would have been nice to see what the villains would look like. Oh well, at least the Ninja can practice against one another. I do caution those who play with these though to avoid spinning them into faces, they could hurt. I&rsquo;d Recommend getting these for the parts, the tornado Spinners alone are great to have for accuracy to the show displays and stop motions. In fact these new Spinners would work great with Stop Motions.</span></span></span></span></p>

Maybe even during the Holidays.</span></span></span></span></p>
