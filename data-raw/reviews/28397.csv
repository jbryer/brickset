"TBillz","2020-05-28T15:33:19.247Z","This Burger Bar is on Fiiiire!","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Introduction</b> &ndash; As soon as this set was released it caught my eye as a fun little food stand that I had to have. It is unique in its small form but very well-built in the fact it resembles a common but maybe overlooked building&nbsp;you&rsquo;d see in any city.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Minifigures</b> &ndash; 8/10 The two firefighter figures are unique and great additions to the set, with the dark tan figure being my favorite in the bunch. The Burger Bar chef is a good figure as well. I wasn&rsquo;t blown away by any of them but it contains a good mix to not be too repetitive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The Build</b> &ndash; 9/10 the firetruck build is different in which the rear portion is essentially hollow to fit the giant turkey baster hose unit. It&rsquo;s a good play feature but slightly takes away from the &ldquo;real&rdquo; look of the truck. The Burger Bar was the real draw for me. It&rsquo;s a simple build really but I love the menu sign stickers, with the sliding glass window and the green and mustard yellow striping on the building. It all just looks so awesome all put together. Yes, it&rsquo;s not a huge building but nor is it&rsquo;s real world counterpart. The Burger sign is very clever and if you&rsquo;d like to remove the fire elements on the back, this would easily blend into any city layout.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Parts</b> &ndash; 10/10 The parts for this set won&rsquo;t be very good for a part pack, it truly builds the vehicle and the stand using as few pieces as possible but does so in a very efficient way. This mix of color makes it visually appealing. I recommend buying it for the build as you see it to add to your city. It really doesn&rsquo;t need anything additional.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Value</b> &ndash; 8/10 In the USA it retails for $40 which seems just slightly high for what you get in the completed set. Without looking at the part count, I really feel like it&rsquo;s closer to a $30 set which you can find it on sale so that makes it worth it. I will say that once you get it built you don&rsquo;t need to do much for additional modification. You could add a little seating area or something in front of the bar but truly the set is complete once you get it all built. I think part of the price was probably driven up by the Turkey Baster mechanism in the back of the fire truck. I see that feature appealing to a younger crowd.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Overall</b> &ndash; 9/10 I love the Burger Bar part of this set, simply for the fact that the colors are great, it&rsquo;s a complete build and it would seamlessly fit into any city layout. The firetruck is a good mid-sized addition to your Lego fire fleet and the minifigures are a well-rounded group without any doubles. The fire motorcycle is a nice little addition&hellip; maybe the rider can carry a fire extinguisher to the scene? Overall I got this set for the Burger stand itself and I&rsquo;m very glad I did. &nbsp;Pick this set up and put it in your city. Your minifigures will thank you!</p>

<p>This set comes with a fire truck, a burger bar and a little motorcycle</p>

<h3>Burger bar</h3>

<p>I think the burger bar is the main part of this set. You can slide the window open. Next to the windows there are two menu stickers. On the top of the window there is another sticker with a sign that says burger on it. The inside of the burger bar is not that detailed. On the right there os a burger, some ketchup,&nbsp;some mustered and some orange juice. On the left there is a stove. Next to the building there is the big sign. On the top of the sign there is a hamburger that almost looks good enough to eat. On top of that you can put the fire up or down.</p>

<h3>Fire motorcycle</h3>

<p>The fire motorcycle is not that big it has two stickers on it. On the back it has a small light.</p>

<h3>Fire truck</h3>

<p>The fire truck Is a cool build. The back of the truck can spin around and you can pull on the big water blaster and squeeze it so the water at the fire on the burger bar (It is not real water).</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>This set comes with three minifigs. They are the fireman, The fire woman and the burger bar chef.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Fireman</h3>

<p>The fireman has a fire hat, a visor, an oxygen tank, A dark tan body with a cool print and dark tan legs with a good fireman print.</p>

<h3>Fire woman</h3>

<p>The fire woman has a red fire hat, A normal lady face print, A black body with a cool fireman print on it and black legs with a good fireman print on the legs.</p>

<h3>Burger bar chef</h3>

<p>&nbsp;The burger bar chef has The clone wars Obi-Wan hair mold in dark brown. He has a happy expression and on the other side he has a worried expression. He has a good chef body, and plain black legs.</p>

<h2>My opinions</h2>

<p>This is a great lego city set. I like how you can shoot the fire with the water. I give the playability a 10 out of 10. you should buy this stet if you find it on sale.</p>
