"Gus_263","2008-02-25T12:59:42.467Z","Happy meal's matoro","The first set of matoro, includes the light blue and white colors, a good scheme, combining very with the akaku, mask of he and kopaka. The body is with the arms, in one you can launch a disk, in another you can't. The legs are short, later used in bohrok va. The disk also inclues a image of the mask.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-04-07T22:51:40.793Z","Matoran Matoro!","Firstly I want to give some background for the newer LEGO fans. LEGO did away with the Slizers and the Robo Riders at the end of 2000. This was due to this awesome series, Bionicle starting in 2001. There is quite an extensive story to Bionicle so if you are interested most of it can be found at www.bioniclestory.com

Where these guys fit into the story is, On the island of Mata Nui all was well. There were six tribes who lived in six different areas on the island, each filled with small villagers called Matoran, led by a Turaga elder. Matoran villagers of Mata Nui live and work in six villages around the island. This little guy is a promotional version of a Matoran and his name is Matoro. Matoro eventually became a mighty Toa warrior before making the ultimate sacrifice to save the Great Spirit Mata Nui.

He was only released promotionally at McDonald's with a Happy Meal so you can't expect too much from him. He is a whole eight pieces including disk and is much smaller than the Turaga. His colour Scheme is White and blue. He has the same mask as Toa Kopaka, but in Blue, making it rare. The mask is the Kanohi Akaku, the Great Mask of X-Ray Vision.

His weapon is throwing disk, similar to that of the Slizers. The throwing arm is alot shorter though and is very flexible. I have had mine for over five years and it is still in perfect condition. The disk can be thrown over five meters reasonably accurately, once you get the hang of it, making them quite fun to play with.

The Instructions for this set are good too. They show lots of pictures, how to combine the Matoran to make bigger and better models from three or all six of them. Also on the other side is a nice poster with this Matoran standing next to his Toa.

Overall for a promotional item these are quite good with reasonable aesthetics and good playability. They add another dimension to the Bionicle World and shouldn't be pushed aside due to there size. I feel this model is a 5/10 and is much deserving of a place in anyone's bionicle collection.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Zapp_Brannigan","2010-11-01T19:33:01.783Z","McDonald's promotion","<p>I got this set 8 or 9 years ago at a McDonald's restaurant when I ordered a Happy Meal. Once I got home, it took me 10 seconds to build this 8 piece set but I played with it for much longer than that.</p>
<p>You get a head piece, body piece, arm pieces, leg pieces, a mask, and a disk.&nbsp;One arm&nbsp;is flexible and can hold onto the disk. The feet are very wide which allows you to place the model on a flat surface and display it. You put the disk into the hand, pull back on the arm, and watch the disk go flying! I used to do this for minutes on end and it would never get boring!</p>
<p>The only problem with this set is that after a while the arm starts to lose&nbsp;its flexibility, and the mask falls off too easily. Other than that, this is a nice little Happy Meal toy, but I lost it a long time ago (In fact I just remembered that I had this set!). Starting to feel a bit nostalgic here :)</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,5
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T07:14:05.64Z","McDonalds finally makes something worthwhile","So McDonalds has created a decent Happy Meal (just around the time I ate them!) and with it, a free LEGO set. Though this does not have the bricks that the previous LEGO/McDonalds kits had, it does however have Bionicle masks. The torso is really cool and can serve many creative purposes. The head is really blocky, but has been used often since its creation. The throwing arm, though bsed on throwbots technology, is not as good as the powerful throwbot arms, or the Vahki pincers to come.

This one has a cool mask, but blue isn't the best color for it. This bionicle is also an upper set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Kalhiki","2009-10-29T18:03:42.107Z","the last one","Last set of these McDonalds Matoran. If this were Kopeke I'd do the whole review like this: ...
But I won't. This is Matoro. He plays a big role in the story in 2007, but that's not this set. Matoro doesn't have much personality. He seems kinda bland. Maybe the colors. He's got the disk throwing arm, and that's really all. But he's still a fine set.
Overall a good set. But still, if your planning on getting him, it'll probably only be for display, parts, or for the collection. Or because you like ice characters.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"123MrBrick","2015-07-15T00:32:36.55Z","He'll Take it From Here.","<p>I recently got 5 of the McToran (the six McDonalds Bionicle figures) from ebay and I am very happy with them. Matoro&#39;s cool mask and color scheme make him my favorite of the McToran.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I got these figures loose so I can&#39;t really say anything here. Look at Brickset&#39;s picture if you want to see the polybag.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Matoro shares all of his parts, with the exception of the mask, with his fellow McToran. However, Matoro features the parts in unique colors. I really like his Bamboo Disk, which features the Kanohi Akaku on it, and the Akaku itself, which looks great in sand-blue.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Building this set takes maybe 30 seconds. There are only 8 parts in the set, and it is extremely simple to peg it all together.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I really like the finished product. While it is not the most realistic design, the figure still looks cool. He has several features: his right arm will throw the included Bamboo Disk when pulled back; his other arm will &quot;punch&quot; when pulled back, and he can store his Bamboo Disk on his back. I am kind of worried that the arms will break, but so far nothing has happened. I&nbsp; have not been able to knock his mask off with a punch or Disk throw, which is kind of disappointing.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set will really only appeal to Bionicle fans. Unless you really want to get the whole set of them, I think getting one McToran will bring you the same amount of fun as getting all of them.&nbsp;I mainly got these for the Kanohi masks. If you only want to get one, Matoro is the one to get.</p>

As Nuju's right hand and translator, he is highly respected amongst other Ko-Matoran. During his spare time he goes into the drifts of Mount Ihu to hunt for game like Kane-Ra Bulls <span style='line-height: 115%; font-family: ""Verdana"",""sans-serif""; font-size: 9.5pt;'>indigenous to the area. The build although short, is actualy fun since there is alot of anticipation to play with him which brings me to my next topic. Playability is endless,&nbsp;alot can happen in</span>

millennia before the Toa arrived and you can still play when the Toa arrive! Although&nbsp;I personaly&nbsp;do not like McDonalds Lunches/Dinners, it would be worth eating a four piece McNuggets with fries and a soda to get him!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Gameaucracy","2015-03-25T06:05:07.573Z","Matoro, My Neighbor Matoro","<p style=""font-size: medium;"">Oh yeah baby, the McDonalds sets. These were amazing when I was a kid. A LEGO set AND heart-attack inducing chunks of question-mark chicken? Where do I sign? Oh right I was a kid I didn&#39;t have to sign anything! Just had to pester my parents enough to take me there. Oh memories of that&nbsp;ball-pit, I can still smell the discarded diapers (psychiatrist&nbsp;says I&#39;m making great progress).</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">The set is just a bare-bones&nbsp;Bionicle&nbsp;set, like 3 parts with a disk that you can shoot at your brother when he tries to steal one of your fries. Yeah yeah LEGO instructions, I see your &quot;don&#39;t hit anyone in the face&quot; warning. This was back in the wild west days of lawsuits, don&#39;t need no rules to ruin my good time.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">So instead of describing these sets, I&#39;m just going to copy paste the&nbsp;last&nbsp;paragraphs and instead describe the amazing sodium and trans-fats meal I had.</p>

<p style=""font-size: medium;"">For this set I had a had a cheeseburger. Well, it was supposed to be a hamburger but when you pay a 15-year old minimum wage to shovel piles of salt with fries in them to busy people you aren&#39;t going to take the time to double check. Now I suffer from a debilitating condition called being a picky little girl so my overworked and tired dad spent the next 3 minutes scraping off cheese from this thing like he was trying to plane a piece of wood. You know, instead of going up to complain because his son is too much of a whiny wuss&nbsp;to suck it up and eat the damn thing. Looking back I cannot see why my parents had such patience for my nonsense.</p>
