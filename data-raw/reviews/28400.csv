"Kalhiki","2019-01-11T19:55:05.69Z","Great Shark, Great Price, Great Set","<p>For the purpose of this review, I&#39;m only looking at the shark. Haven&#39;t built the other two alternate models yet.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>Build was straightforward. The Shark is divided into four sections (head, 2 body segments, and tail tip)&nbsp;Most of the fun was in the head, which had lots of nice SNOT techniques and interesting parts. Also worth noting is that the interior structure is mostly done with red pieces. Whether intentional or not, it gives a nice &quot;blood and guts&quot; look and makes the build that much more entertaining.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PARTS</strong></p>

<p>The set comes with a decent selection of parts. Most notably are the relatively new 1x2 Plate with Bow, 45 Degree Cut. Also present are quite a few Mixel-style&nbsp;balljoints, which are always useful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>THE MODEL</strong></p>

<p>When finished, you got a really nice looking shark (and a crab, which is equally as cute!). The shark is really impressive and nails the general shape of the animal. It&#39;s also well articulated with opening jaw and side-to-side movement along its body. The articulation is slightly limited, but gives a natural amount of movement to the body, so I can&#39;t really complain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My favorite part is the head, which not only looks good, but functions just as well. The mouth is convincing, the angles a right, and the details are great. The eye, being a single lightsaber&nbsp;rod, also allows for some amazing light piping, making it really pop.</p>

<p>My biggest gripe is probably some of the colors. The balljoints are all light or dark gray. It&#39;s not too distracting, but it&#39;s fairly noticeable in the tail.</p>

<p>As I said, I haven&#39;t built the other two models, but they look pretty decent based on the stock photos (I&#39;d say the Angler looks a bit better than the Squid, though). But what I find to be more impressive is that this isn&#39;t just a 3-in-1. The end of the instructions point the builder online, where they can get instructions to build a fourth model: a Whale! Looks pretty good, and I may have to check it out!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>OVERALL</b></p>

<p>For a cost of $15 USD, this is a steal. Especially when you see it has 230 pieces. The shark alone is worth the price of admission, and on top of that you also have not two, but three more alternate builds. Definitely worth picking up, and easily one of the best Creator 3-in-1s&nbsp;I&#39;ve bought.</p>

<p>Highly Recommended!</p>

"Brentski","2019-02-02T15:45:39.46Z","Jaws!","<p>This is a nice little set, I initially wasn&#39;t looking at it, but the small crab caught my eye for a long term project.</p>

<p>The only thing that stops this set from a higher rating for me is the featured build is just a little chunky for me. It is seriously not a big deal, just brings the set from a 5 to a 4 for me personally.</p>

<p>Building is about 40 minutes, a quick reprise during the day, or between other responsibilities. A lot of internal build to complete the external finished piece.</p>

<p>A fair amount of specialized parts, I find this to be true with most of the 3 in 1 animal builds. The pieces&nbsp;will actually be helpful in other things I have in mind.</p>

<p>Playability seems decent, more of a builder/displayer than player.</p>

<p>Great value, I can see picking up another one of these!</p>

<p>Deep sea creatures is the only one of the creator 3in1 brick built animals that caught my attention and this set easily became my favourite creator 3in1set I own for its great build and its incredible value for &pound;13 in the UK .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>(This review will only go in depth with the shark , crab and treasure chest as the other builds will be touched upon briefly as this review is already long enough)</p>

<p>Starting with the shark its self , the tail is built on a 1&times;6 light grey plate with dark blue plates ontop , a hinge connection with the lower part built on a 1&times;3 dark blue plate with each part having a slope and the top being longer with a 1&times;1 dark blue cheese slope and a mixle mini ball joint to attach to the next segment . Next we&nbsp;have the back which is built on two 1&times;6 white underside curved bricks with plate building above with another mixle joint to attach the tail and there is a 1&times;2 modified black plate to attach an angled flag on each side in dark blue for the side fins , there is snot building to attach a slope build that is mirrored on both sides with a 2&times;2 white slopes and some dark blue ones above , there are two more mixle joints packed inside underneath all of the snot building to make it extra secure and the top is tiled off with two 1&times;4 dark blue slopes and a 2&times;2 dark blue tile . Next we have the main body which is built on a 2&times;4 white plate with some slope , plate and brick base building to curve it into a more accurate shape , there is building on the sides with a 1&times;6 dark blue brick each , a ball joint attachment with a row of six 1&times;2 dark blue slope bricks each to get the necessary shape at the top&nbsp;with more tiling ontop and jumpers attaching a build for the dorsal fin built on a 1&times;3&nbsp;dark blue plate with slope bricks building up and a slope on the very top , each of the previously mentioned side ball joints attach a fin each using a 3&times;3 dark blue angled plate for maximum articulation and the inside has more ball joints to connect it all together . The head is the most sturdy as it is just snots&nbsp;and plates so it can&#39;t break the sides have a white 2&times;2 slope with the dark blue gills on each side represented with 1&times;1 and 1&times;2 dark blue cheese slopes , an angled plate above the mouth each with a larger angled slope making the nose have a more streamlined feel the eyes are a very cool assembly using a 1&times;4 light trans neon bar with some technic buffers around them and if you put a light behind it the eyes glow so that&#39;s cool , the top has more sloping with a bigger piece at the front that brings the shape together and one last 2&times;2 dark blue tile , the teeth all use a 1&times;2 light tan tooth plate design with pink inside the mouth and the jaw also uses that piece with a clip making you able to open and close worthwhile sloping around the sides and a 2&times;2 pink slope for the tongue inside . The side builds starting with the crab , it is built on a 2&times;2 round light tan tile with some bars above to connect six legs built with clips and red tooth pieces , the face is attached with snot and has sloping ontop&nbsp;and two eyes printed on 1&times;1 white round tiles and each pincer attached with a mixle joint&nbsp;and a pair of clip teeth on each which are articulated . And finally we have the other side built which is just some underwater scenery , built on a light tan 3&times;6 round plate with some slopes to the left and dark grey as the colour for a rock formation and a sea weed piece in light green ontop for more scenery , the main section is a standard large Lego crate piece in redish brown attached at an angle with three 1&times;1 pearl gold studs , a pearl gold goblet , a trans neon green gem and two 2&times;2 trans neon green dishes to represent algae . I will just briefly touch on the other builds ; Angler fish very good , squid ok nothing to write home about and the whale I don&#39;t really like because it&#39;s articulation is so restricted .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a great set with a fantastic main build , decent side builds that don&#39;t feel like filler and the value is amazing , overall I actually can&#39;t think of any complaints with this sets default form so I highly recommend it to any Lego fan .&nbsp;</p>
