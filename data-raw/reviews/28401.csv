"East64","2019-05-13T16:29:28.853Z","Good looking for display but mediocre otherwise","<p>The end result of this set is very cool, its quite tall and stylish. The poses it can take are limited&nbsp;because&nbsp;it doesn&#39;t have knees or elbows, but still looks cool on the shelf. The secondary submarine build is really cool as well for a bit more realism.</p>

<p>Unfortunately I wasn&#39;t a big fan of the build. Places that I would&#39;ve expected ball joints are these joints that snap into place and twist in one direction with ratcheting clicks. I suppose it adds stability but didn&#39;t feel very &#39;lego&#39; to me, otherwise there are a lot of very specialized and big parts here so there weren&#39;t many surprises. The build didn&#39;t end up being very interesting, there isn&#39;t much internal structure here because the pieces are generally pretty big, so what you see is pretty much what you get besides in the torso section, and even that wasn&#39;t as interesting to put together as most other builds that I&#39;ve done.</p>

<p>You get some interesting parts here, the dome, tubes, and air tanks are good to have for any aquatic themed free building. Otherwise you&#39;re getting a lot of big parts, I believe that most of these parts aren&#39;t going to be very flexible for use outside, but if you&#39;re looking for the ratcheting joints this is a good place to get them.</p>

<p>Price per part is fine here and the parts are big and unique, so the value is fine, and the value relative to the size and coolness of the main model for display is excellent.</p>

<p><strong>Model I: Robot</strong></p>

<p>I love robots just for themselves, and this is no exception. I looks great. Has many moving parts, even though elbows and knees are still. whole body can be rotated, model is fairly stable. Hands are designed pretty well, has nice amount of &quot;grability&quot;. The drill attached&nbsp;to center of hand is weird but works good. I like they add two bottles of oxygen at his back. They are great, especially with flex tubes attached to them. Canopy with one eye is perfect and adds a lot. For me it looks just funny.</p>

<p>I like the really subtle details they put on this sweet robot. It has small radiator(?) on his chest, as well as plate with some clock. Dark gray plates on his legs and arms are pretty simple, but great. Also, foot are made great. Usage of window panels gave them interesting shape, and black grill&nbsp;slopes break the color nicely.</p>

<p>As a side build we got seaweed and some gold nuggets, which is ok, and great manta. This small creature looks quite astonishing. Has a great colors, with white belly and dark blue back, its fins made of flags are superb and a claw at the back of its tail looks great. Also its eyes seems pretty cool.</p>

<p>When you remove an eye of a robot, you will be able to fit a minifig inside.</p>

<p><strong>Model II: Submarine</strong></p>

<p>This model is even better. It feels more classic and nostalgic to me, is designed very carefully. To be honest there is nothing really special, but overall it is perfect. Engine at its back looks good, and can spin. Arms with some grabber and pipes attached to them are great. Canopy is really simple, lights over it are nice. The best thing about it is that you can put a minifig inside, and really play with it. Only weak point for me are windows without any glass, but is a trifle. Overall, one of the best models this year.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Model III: Underwater station</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t what lego&nbsp;has done here. This model looks exactly like nothing. It is neither a crane, nor an excavator, neither robot, nor machine operated by man. It is something between all those things. Base looks weird and somehow unfinished. Legs are simple and identical, but quite nice with rounded end. Upper part can rotate, long arm has a nice range of movement, pipes attached&nbsp;to it adds a lot. Canopy is not so good, especially because it is to small to fit a minifig, and too open to pretend it is a robot, even though light over it seems to be eyes. This model is a downgrade compare to ret of the set.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>They are quite nice. Lot of yellow bricks, lot of curve bricks. Gold nugget are nice, but quite useless. Canopy and flexi&nbsp;tubes are great. There are also many brackets, the best being a new 1x1 in medium azure.</p>

"Puidwen","2019-12-30T17:51:12.62Z","This set is seriously nifty","<p>I built the submarine.&nbsp; Lego put a lot of unusual and useful parts in this set.&nbsp; It really looks like a large one man submarine.&nbsp; It has a lot of articulation. Everything you should expect to move, moves.&nbsp; The rock climber from 60202 fits easily inside it even wearing his helmet.&nbsp; When building this set, it is very sturdy, not one of those that falls apart if just brush it while your process of building it.&nbsp; I only had two problems.&nbsp; One was some small trouble getting the hoses in.&nbsp; The other is that the holders for the cockpit canopy turn, and i had a bit or trouble getting them to line up right. Speaking of the canopy, i will say one of the few problems with this set is that because it&#39;s on ratchet joints, it&#39;s a bit hard to open.&nbsp; It isn&#39;t too complex a build, but i suspect a young a child would need help.&nbsp; Even after building the submarine about half the parts in this set were left.&nbsp; I just recommend this set in general, and i suspect that a really creative type would like it.</p>
