"StarKiller22515","2019-12-08T02:51:15.917Z","Really good Battlepack","<p>This set is so good! You get 3 Praetorian guards and a First Order stormtrooper. While it would have been nice to get another Praetorian guard instead of a stormtrooper we need to look on the bright side, at least it wasn&#39;t a first order gunner. The build for this isn&#39;t terrible either and I can see that kids would have a lot of fun playing with this. Its built so that you can have the guards train and fight against each other. Another cool thing about the set is that there are enough pieces so that you can make your own custom weapons for the guards. I would highly recommend buying 2 or 3 of these if you thought that the Snokes throne room fight in the Last Jedi was cool.</p>

"RaiderOfTheLostBrick","2019-12-27T09:29:32.52Z","Great figures and... thatâ€™s it.","<p>Like the movie that inspired it, 2018&rsquo;s&nbsp;Snoke&rsquo;s Throne Room divided fans. Many considered it to be too pricey&nbsp;and didn&rsquo;t have enough detail, while others loved the minifigures included, particularly the Praetorian Guards. Forunately, some more guards feature in this Battle Pack, but how good is this set on a whole?</p>

<p>The Good:</p>

<p>-Figures (particularly the Praetorian Guards)</p>

<p>-Good parts to build weapons</p>

<p>The Mixed:</p>

<p>- The play feature (two turntables for some guards to duel on) is neat, but some levers or handles might benefit it greatly.</p>

<p>The Bad:</p>

<p>-Build is pretty basic and not great fun to build.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>This Battle Pack is fine. The Praetorian Guards are excellent figures that don&rsquo;t disappoint, however, while I do like the concepts of the build, it ultimately fails. Forunately the figures do make up for the price and some parts may interest those looking to build minifigure&nbsp;weapons.</p>

<p>So yeah, this is fine, but not the best Battle Pack.</p>

"BrickofFate","2020-01-12T10:39:49.717Z","The elite pack","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;After seeing them in the film,the praetorian guards are very desirable minifigures.With their red armour they can only be mistaken for the iconic imperial guards of Palpatine.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The box:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The box looks great.It is the normal size for a battle pack.The 2019 theme with Darth Vader really coresponds with the art of the battle pack,with the light red,dark grey and black parts of it.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The instructions:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Fortunately,they are not folded in the middle as some other instructions in the same sized box,simply because this battlepack doen not have many pieces.The instructions for the set are standart.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The piecies:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The most interesting parts are the helmets for the guards,some bigger light red bricks and red lightsaber hilts.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The build:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; It is actually enjoyable to assemble the smal arena.It takes only 10 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The minifigures:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;They are excellent.The battle pack comes with two types of praetorian guards and one stormtrooper.The two types of praetorian guards differ only by their helmets as two of them have a more rectangular&nbsp; shape and the other is more rounded at the back and front.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The playfeatures:</p>

<p>&nbsp; There are three of them.The most notable is the spinning platform on which the guards train by dueling.Though the minifigures fall when you make them fight as the front of the box shows.It is better for play to have both of their legs on the platform.The weapons rack can be removed easily.You can push it and pretend that it is damage from their fight.The droid on the right side can be removed too.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Conclusion:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This battle pack is just great.Although it can be with four instead&nbsp; of three praetorian guards,iI prefer that there is a stormtrooper who is great to that to your army.In this way the battle pack has some variety.The set is really good both for display and play.</p>

"scalawag","2020-01-10T00:44:57.98Z","Nice set","<p>I am new to lego as an adult. &nbsp;I played with it as a kid, and someone just bought me this as a present as they know I love Star Wars.</p>

<p>This is a great little set with lots of nice details and the ability to build/design your own weapons. &nbsp;It&#39;s a little&nbsp;weird&nbsp;that the fourth figure is a storm trooper and not another guard.</p>

"Struhadlo","2020-04-10T10:53:00.597Z","When you get invited to the party, but you don't know anyone there.","<p>That is probably how does that lonely Stormtrooper feels like.</p>

<p>Just when Lego decides to bless us with a Battle Pack that has basically 3 figures of the same rank and one additional minifig which is not an officer, they put in characters that are 8 in total in the whole cinematic universe. Oh god&nbsp;why? And before you smash that &quot;unhelpful&quot; button because you disagree with me, hear me out. The main attribute of a Battle Pack is to build an army. How do you want to build an army of 8 guys is beyond me. It is almost the same problem as with the named Jedi in a Battle Pack.</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>

<p>Lego seems to be on a killing spree with how many potentially good Battle Packs they have killed lately with unnecessary additions of useless officers and crew members. And when they decide not to put in any of those, they murder the annual Battle Pack spots with named characters. And now they have discovered a brand new way to ruin a Battle Pack. Elite units which are limited to very few individuals in the cinematic universe. I firmly belive that characters such as Preatorian guards should be limited to bigger and more expensive sets especially when we bear the knowledge of how many of them are there in the movies.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>First Order Stormtrooper. A standard First Order Stormtrooper with pretty detailed print on the torso and the back. The legs have sufficient printing too and there is no print on the arms. The helmet is nice and thick with gorgeously detailed print. The face is a spot on recreation of what the helmet looks like in the movies. These Stormtroopers are truly one of the better minifigs. The head piece is a regular single expression angry clone.</li>
	<li>Elite Preatorian Guard with the flat helmet. There are two of these in the set. And boy do they look good. The weakest part is a very simple print on the legs and the waist, but other than that this is a magnificent minifig. The print on the torso and the back carries&nbsp;a lot of detail and the helmet with the shoulder armour makes this one of the bulkiest minifigs out there. Trust me, the helmet is huge. You can remove the shoulder armours if you take off the head. Thankfully the head is a red faceless mold, so there is no awkward flash shinning between the helmet and the neck. I will get to the weaponry later.</li>
	<li>Elite Preatorian Guard with the pointy helmet. The last minifig&nbsp;is the same as the two other guards, the only difference is the shaping of the helmet. The different shape makes for a little less bulky minifig, but the other perks remain untouched.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>The build in the set is this strange platform with bunch of stands for the weapons and a training droid. The training droid is armed with a lightsaber and a blaster gun. The gun is not a classic mold but a pistol with two barrels. It looks pretty cool and you can add more stuff on the barrels to make it longer. The platform itself has two round plates with the ability to spin. You are supposed to put minifigs on these and simulate combat. There is no leaver to turn the plates, you need to move the minifigs yourself.&nbsp;The side without the droid has a stand with 4 clips for the weaponry. And there is a lot of weapons in this set. There are two humongous spears made from two red lightsaber hilts, grey sticks and a machete or a spear blade. There is one more spare machete. Interesting weapon is this chain thing with a bolt at then end. Other weapons are a claw, bolt and a red lightsaber hilt with two fangs on each side.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think this build makes sense in the context of the minifigs presented and the armoury is a great addition to your collection.</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>There is one stud shooter in the set which as usual poses a lot of difficulties with shooting and re-loading.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As already mentioned, the platform is to simulate a combat and it somewhat works, but not with every weapon. If you arm your guards with those spears, they will clash with the hilts and not the blades which is awkward. With shorter weapons the mechanism works fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set has four minifigs so you can play with the minifigs as usual. I think the extended armoury adds to the playability factor of the set.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>As usual with these problematic Battle Packs, this would be&nbsp;far better if it were a regular set. When you obturate a Battle Pack spot with a set which has almost no army building potential you cannot expect a warm reception despite the high quality of the content. Just stop calling this a Battle Pack, create another set which will be a Battle Pack instead of this one and you will be just fine Lego.</p>

<p>I do recommend the purchase of the set since the minifigs are of a premium quality, but this is not a good Battle Pack if a Battle Pack at all.</p>

"vikings","2020-05-23T06:53:37.943Z","Great Battle Pack","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a small box. The dimensions of the box are 7.5 x 5.6 x 1.8 inches and weighs 0.26 pounds. Comes with a small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some good parts in this set. You get a silver machete and dagger/sword blade, black space gun, and some studs with a hole (Black and maroon). The total piece count for this set is 109.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Praetorian Guard:</strong></p>

<p>You get three Praetorian Guards (two which are the same). Each are armed with a different weapon (With an extra for the weapon rack). The two that are same both wield spears. The spears consist of two red lightsaber hilts and a grey stick. The blades are different. For one, you get a machete and the other is a dagger/sword blade. Both look very good. These Praetorian Guards have a flat helmet. The helmets look amazing. The rest is the same. They have red shoulder armor which looks really good. They have printing on the front and back of their torso and on their legs as well. The printing does a nice job of showing their armor. The other guard has a round helmet. The helmet looks really good and has a point on the front of it. He is armed with a chain weapon. This is made of a red lightsaber hilt, silver chain, and a silver spike. This is a nice weapon (One uses something similar to it in the Last Jedi) The rest of the guard is the same as the other two. All three have plain red heads.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>First Order Stormtrooper:</strong></p>

<p>The First Order Stormtrooper is the same as the ones before. It is still a nice figure to get. The markings on the helmet are very good. The printing on the torso and legs does a great job of showing the armor of the trooper. He has the&nbsp;normal trooper head. He is armed with a stud shooter (Which I hate) and would have preferred the standard blaster or rifle.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>First Order Training Droid:</strong></p>

<p>The droid is really and is made up of 14 pieces. You get a clear dish and pole which is nice to have when having a Praetorian guard train with it. The droid has two arms which hold two weapons: A black space gun&nbsp;and a dark grey silver lightsaber hilt with a red blade (Or red lightsaber). Overall a real cool First Order training droid.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy took me less than 10 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great battle pack to add to you Star Wars or Lego collections. The platform is very nice. You have two areas were you have the weapons rack (with an extra weapon) and where the training droid can go. The extra weapon is a dual spike made up of a red lightsaber hilt, two maroon studs with a hole, and two silver grey spikes (Not a bad weapon). The platform has two areas for Praetorian guards to practice dual each other. The areas rotate 360 degrees. I do wish they added some kind of handle or something to spin them and not the plate itself. The figures are great. It is nice and cheap way to get the Praetorian Guards in a Lego set. The First Order Stormtrooper was a nice figure to get. I highly recommend this set if you are a fan of Star Wars or are just interested in these types of sets in general. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
