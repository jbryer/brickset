"jdm","2019-01-11T23:16:23.57Z","Great for kids....not for AFOLs","<p>This version of the x-wing falls into Legos new 4+ category. &nbsp;And it does exactly what it says on the tin -&nbsp;You get a reasonably good rendition of the famous ship, all-be-it dumbed down for your younger builders. &nbsp;</p>

<p>My son is 5 and&nbsp;until now he has never built a&nbsp;lego&nbsp;set&nbsp;all on his own without help. He is Ninjago mad, but was dead set on this when he saw it in the shop (even better than the Golden dragon!). For him,&nbsp;Lego Star Wars has really only&nbsp;been&nbsp;watching the TV&nbsp;shows. &nbsp;So Lego have correctly identified this gap and produced a junior version of the heroic vessel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Build</p>

<p>It&#39;s basic. &nbsp;The gun turret is not particularly interesting.&nbsp;There are a number of large pieces so it goes up fairly quickly. &nbsp;Aesthetically it&#39;s not great but I do like the use of the exhaust piece for the 2 blasters. &nbsp;I am not sure what the build in front part of the turret is supposed to represent - perhaps the reactor core or something, but it doesn&#39;t really add anything. &nbsp;Personally&nbsp;I would have preferred a bit more design and shaping instead on the turret itself. The firing mechanism is not new but my son thought it was great. I do think it would have been useful to have some sort of container to store the ammo in though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the vessel, well it is identifiable but it lacks a lot of detail.&nbsp;The fuselage is mostly one large piece that you just bolt some slope pieces and 4 wings onto. It&#39;s that easy. &nbsp;This is probably harsh coming from an AFOL who has been fortunate enough to be able to build a number of UCS models, but there are some shaping issues, particularly at the back which is very stubby. &nbsp;I also really think that the designer should have incorporated some way of fixing R2 into the ship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having said all this, it&#39;s not supposed to be a UCS. It&#39;s for small kids, and in that respect it works really well. The finished model&nbsp;is solid, highly swooshable&nbsp;and perfect for little people!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs</p>

<p>A good classic selection that allows the young (new) fan to own 3 key characters. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conclusion</p>

<p>POSITIVES - no stickers, good minifigs, highly swooshable, good play value</p>

<p>NEGATIVES - expensive, lacks detail&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a really good play set for younger builders. &nbsp;The final model, whilst not as detailed as other more expensive versions, is very solid and highly swooshable&nbsp;and allows the famous trench run to be played out effectively. &nbsp;Pieces do not come off easily, and even if they do, for the first time ever I did not get &#39;Daddy can you fix my lego please&#39; a hundred times because they were actually able to do it themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However this is not a set (imo) that an AFOL is going to get any pleasure in building but you should enjoy watching your little ones build their own ship all on their own, until the day they want to build your UCS version.....&nbsp;</p>

"iwybs","2019-06-10T06:05:20.34Z","A childhood makeshift turned official set","<p>As a kid at the turn of the century, I built a series of small makeshift X-wings that were very similar in dimensions and technique to this set, save that I only had enough hinges and 4x9 wedge plates for the upper wings and, of course, I built the fuselage from basic bricks and slopes rather than using a Juniors base!&nbsp; Naturally, I had to get this set for the sake of my childhood builds.&nbsp; As an X-wing model, it naturally leaves much to be desired, but as a simple playset for little kids I think it&#39;s great.&nbsp; The spaceship is very simple, easy to build, easy to swoosh and easy to repair.&nbsp; It can&#39;t hold R2-D2, but it does have a clip on the back for the lightsaber.&nbsp; The 4x9 wedge plates have the wrong shape for the wings of the Incom T-65B, but they&#39;re acceptable simplifications for a model like this.&nbsp; Likewise, the plain, unadorned classic laser gun parts aren&#39;t entirely faithful to the source material, but they&#39;re very simple and entirely adequate for the purposes of this set. Even if you don&#39;t like the main model for the set, there&#39;s a lot of good parts in this X-wing: four laser guns, four 4x9 wedge plates, four 3x4 hinge plates and four 1x4 hinge plates to pair with them, and a whopping 8 City wheels (without tires) and new-for-2019 half-axles.</p>

<p>Despite its simplicity, I&#39;m surprised by how well the turret evokes the Death Star trench turrets seen in the film. Between the two guns there&#39;s a 2x2 disc shooter; unfortunately, this only rotates, and does not elevate.&nbsp; It comes with three discs for ammunition.&nbsp; There&#39;s a little control panel and three things to knock over: two barrels of some kind and one transparent green thing which may evoke the Death Star reactor.&nbsp; Again, these aren&#39;t screen-accurate, but they make a nice scene for play.&nbsp; The turret doesn&#39;t have many parts that are useful for the kinds of MOCs I build, but others may like the railings, the long exhaust pipes used for the laser guns, the two modified 2x2 plates with octagonal bars, and the large black corrugated panel at the back.</p>

<p>Between the two builds, there are lots of nice printed parts: two control panels, two 2x2 round tiles with fan prints, three printed parts on the nose of the X-wing, and even two &quot;Red 5&quot; marking tiles that haven&#39;t appeared in printed form since 2006.&nbsp; The minifigure selection is great too: one of the new stormtroopers (very nicely detailed and with an impressive dual-molded helmet that happens to be tremendously inaccurate), the standard R2-D2 minifigure (which ought to be updated with back printing, but is pretty good nevertheless), and a new-for-2019 minifigure of Luke Skywalker with such a detailed print on the front and back of the torso and on the legs that I still haven&#39;t figured out what everything is meant to be.&nbsp; Better still, it uses the old Rebel helmet with a detailed print.&nbsp; (The new helmet is way too big, and the printing is less detailed.)&nbsp; Two faces are included: one with the visor down and a wide-eyed smirk, and one with the visor up and a vague grimace.&nbsp; Unfortunately, neither particularly looks like Mark Hamill to me, but your mileage may vary.</p>

<p>One never expects to get an ideal price-to-parts ratio with Juniors sets because of their reliance on extremely large pieces, but even so this feels a bit overpriced.&nbsp; Compared with the &quot;volume of stuff&quot; in the excellent 31091 Shuttle Transporter from this year&#39;s Creator line, I&#39;d say this comes up short for $30.&nbsp; That set is well priced at $25 but would be better at $20; this would be well priced at $20 or $25 but not at $30, in that regard.&nbsp; Still, I&#39;m satisfied with my purchase.&nbsp; This tickles my inner 5-year-old just as well as the larger 75218 X-wing tickles my inner 10-year-old, and I think the Juniors subtheme of Star Wars is an experiment well worth continuing.</p>

"CommisarRoberts","2020-03-28T16:21:52.153Z","A great set for the young builders","<p>This set is part of the 2019 batch of Star Wars releases by LEGO and at the time of writing is widely available across most stores. This set is made for younger builders and children who are just starting to get into LEGO Star wars and for that reason is a great stepping stone for new builders.</p>

<p>For an AFOL this is a rather quick build about 15 minutes on average and it comes in three separate bags. The set contains 132 pieces which are designed in a way to make the build quick and simple for new builders, I would suggest that this would be a great set for a parent and child to assemble as a team! The set involves the construction of Luke Skywalkers X - Wing as well an Imperial turbo laser turret which fires out small green discs which are a great addition which adds to the sets playability. Both the turbo laser and X -wing look very appealing when the have been constructed so will look good on any display shelf!</p>

<p>The set contains three mini figures: Luke Skywalker in pilots gear with a lightsaber which is a lovely highly detailed mini figure. Luke is accompanied by an R2-D2 mini figure which again is a nice detailed figure with printed decals. There is also a Storm trooper which has the new mould of helmet which I know is controversial to some but I personally think is pretty good, the stormtrooper also carries one of the older style Star Wars guns which is awesome!</p>

<p>In conclusion while this set will certainly not be that challenging for an AFOL it is an excellent set for young builders or children who are just starting out with LEGO Star Wars. I would recommend this too any parent who wants to buy a fun set for their children.&nbsp;</p>
