It is first set I&rsquo;ve built w stickers but I didn&rsquo;t mind applying stickers. I&rsquo;m v impressed by the playability of set and how solid it feels. Once my husband adjusted the headers for me he said it was perfect. It is the only set he&rsquo;s shown interest in. He&rsquo;s a farmer and I&rsquo;d buy more farm sets if they were available. This is an excellent set to build and to play with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The harvester transporter is a nice change in the more regular tractor-trailers due to the somewhat unusual load on the trailer. The harvester also introduces another play element. There are two minifigures (one more would have been nice). The trailer is fairly basic in design, while the tractor is slightly different from previous designs. That said, the truck is arguably the weakest part of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The price is OK, if not good. The PPP is excellent, the price per &quot;volume of stuff&quot; - to use Jang&#39;s terminology - is OK. I can also see why a set like this will not appeal to some of the buying public, but if you are looking for a nice truck-related Lego set, this set should be considered.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build is separated into three parts (three booklets) and four bags: the truck, the trailer, and the harvester. The 5+ age range is appropriate for the construction itself, IMHO; that said, there are quite a few stickers that need to be applied (and adults or older kids be used for help). Even though the construction is simple, it rarely if ever gets boring.</p>

<p>The tractor is bright, blue, an interesting design, but IMHO could also be improved upon in its basic design. Personally, I would have liked to see a 6-wheel trailer, rather than the 4-wheel we have now, which seems to be more logical considering the load on the trailer. The rear wheel being placed at the very back only emphasized the awkward look. Also, I would have liked to see two 4x1&nbsp;tiles added to the top of the rear frame. The awkward look unfortunately undoes much of the IMHO interesting (and good looking) cabin. The design of the cabin seems to be more modern in design, and I like the overall look.</p>

<p>The trailer is very simple (almost basic) and very similar to that of other trailers of the past few years. It&nbsp;nicely consistent in colour scheme with the tractor, and the way the harvester is transported on it seems fairly logical.</p>

<p>The harvester is a neat little build, and by parts the largest build in this set. The design is well done, the few somewhat off colour pieces are well hidden. The pipe for dropping the cuttings into an accompanying truck is nicely done.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>Both the minifigures are well done. Lego lists the scarecrow (a nice little micro-build) as a third minifigure, but IMHO it is more of a micro-build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The scarecrow is well done, with the face print (very nice) and the neck cloth being the most interesting pieces. It is only found in four sets, of which two are OOP (and might no longer be found), and the third is much more expensive.</p>

<p>The driver is nicely detailed, well printed and generally useful. The same can be said for the farmer, who could also figure as a &#39;regular&#39; citizen working his vegetable patch.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Overall, the tractor-trailer is well designed. I like the chosen colour scheme. There are numerous stickers, but IMHO the stickers definitely add to the looks of the truck, the trailer and the harvester. The tractor could definitely be improved, IMHO, but overall the designer has done a very good job. IMHO there is no part of the construction where it looks &#39;unfinished&#39;, while at the same time the design is pretty simple and minimalist. The one good thing, of course, is the red coffee mug for the driver.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>This set IMHO is mostly a play set: harvesting crops, driving the combination around, attaching the cutters to the harvester and loading the harvester on the truck. There should be plenty of play possibilities. Certainly this set could be used as a display set, especially as part of a truck line-up. I would not be surprised if this set inspires larger scale creations.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall I think this is a good set, and one of the more impressive &#39;Great Vehicles&#39; sets of the past few seasons. The build is nice, the price is good and it should provide quite a bit of opportunity for play. All of this for a reasonable price, and this is definitely a set worth considering when out shopping for Lego.</p>

"GHMBricks","2019-11-17T11:20:48.333Z","Lego City 60223 Harvester Transport ","<p>Lego City 60223 is a set which I like so much on first impression, It&#39;s going to be difficult to go throughout&nbsp; this review it will be a challenge to keep a proper critic on this set!</p>

<p>Truck</p>

<p>The truck is mostly a normal city truck but it does have a few interesting things on it, so lets get to them. Probably the most obvious not normal thing is the front of the truck, Because instead of tiles they use Nexo-Knights shield peices in blue with stickers and a 2x2 tile also with sticker. Okay the only different thing is the front, on to the trailer.</p>

<p>Trailer</p>

<p>Now even though this just a trailer it does have a nice surprise, it is completely brick build it does not use a one-peice trailer mold like 60079. It also has a couple of clips to hold on the &quot;harvester&quot; and header.</p>

<p>&quot;Harvester&quot;</p>

<p>The &quot;harvester&quot; or forage harvester as it is properly known is really good. The build is different and uses some clever building technics, The header works perfectly and clips into place on the trailer.</p>

<p>Minifigs</p>

<p>As far as i can tell there is nothing new here at all</p>

<p>Extras</p>

<p>There is a little scarecrow in this set and it is really clever how it is build.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>Interesting builds for all three</p>

<p>Nice scarecrow</p>

<p>Very well done forage harvester</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>The only con that i can see is that playing with this once you have delivered the &quot;harvester&quot; you cant properly use it because currently there is no tractor in the city theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>Overall i still really like this set and highly recommend.</p>

"BJNemeth","2020-05-16T19:51:54.797Z","Straightforward Set with More Stickers Than I Expected","<p>This is a fine set, but not a great set in my opinion. First, I was surprised that a set rated for ages 5+ included 16 stickers, and a few needed to be put on slopes and other slightly tricky areas. Sometimes I skip stickers, preferring to keep the pieces blank, but the fronts and backs of the two vehicles really suffer visually without the stickers.</p>

<p>The playability of this set is very good, as the trailer can be detached and reattached to the truck, and the Harvester can be loaded and unloaded onto the trailer using fold-down ramps. While the blades at the front of the Harvester spin freely on Technic pins, it&#39;s a bit disappointing that they don&#39;t spin automatically while the vehicle is in motion. The Harvester easily attaches on the trailer so it is locked into position and won&#39;t fall off, though the front blade assembly needs to be detached from the Harvester and snapped into the trailer separately.</p>

<p>The Harvester looks fantastic, and I wish it had been&nbsp;available separately as a smaller set. The truck and trailer serve their purpose, and they have a nice color&nbsp;scheme.&nbsp;Unfortunately,&nbsp;when the truck is unhooked from the trailer, it is very front-heavy, and if you hold it by the cab when you roll it around it tends to tip forward. It would also look better with a third row of wheels (in the back) to match the look of real-world trucks.</p>

<p>The two regular minifigs are fine, though if you take the truck driver out of the truck, I don&#39;t think most people would look at the minifig and think of it as a truck driver -- a trucker&#39;s hat would have been nice.&nbsp;The farmer that drives the Harvester is pretty identifiable as a farmer, and I really like the torso with green overalls over a red plaid shirt.</p>

<p>I love the little scarecrow build. Traditional Lego Scarecrows are rare -- the only other one I could find with a printed minifig head came in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71002-2/Scarecrow"">Collectible Minifigure Series 11 (2013</a>), but that one was designed as a regular minifig with a standard torso and legs. (There are also scarecrow minifigs for the <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sh391"">evil Batman villain</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71023-18/Scarecrow"">The Wizard of Oz character</a>.)&nbsp;This scarecrow looks more like what you would actually find on a farm, and it is a charming little build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this set is pretty much what you&#39;d expect by looking at the picture on the box, though I was disheartened by how many stickers were involved.</p>
