<p>I always compare completed model with its box because that&#39;s what you see in store before buying it (or not).</p>

<p><em><img alt=""model with box"" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42094/010_wr_31015k.png"" style=""width: 640px; height: 453px;"" /></em></p>

<p>This one has the same front size as set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42079-1"">42079</a> but 1&quot; (2.5 cm) less height. <em>This surprised me because it doesn&#39;t represent the parts count (<a href=""https://brickset.com/inventories/42094-1"">827</a> resp. <a href=""https://brickset.com/inventories/42079-1"">592</a>).</em></p>

<h3>Assembly</h3>

<p>You start with a couple of sandwiched frame pieces that eventually become the basis of the chassis.<br />
Next, rear part with the winch will be build. This is a first for me: This unit is attached to the chassis bit only by the two knob wheels during build. Then, side panels will be added to provide stability.</p>

<p>I postponed the cabin until the end because I was more curious about the front part. It can easily be added later as it gets attached to the turntable by two 1x2 beams.</p>

<p>The lifting mechanism for the logs gets only as much attention (and parts) as necessary. The &quot;claw&quot; with its many yellow teeth is impressive but the arm behind appears too thin.</p>

<p>Last, the base with tracks is built. This is refreshing as a new way of installing the track rollers is used. I believe that this could be useful for other models as well. I am always surprised that stability can be achieved with few parts: left and right track are combined with two 15M beams and four connectors only . The whole module is then attached to the chassis using four 3L (axle) pins.</p>

<p>Without stickers the completed model looks something like a bumblebee: There is too much contrast between yellow and black parts. (For comparison: The earth blue-and-yellow of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42079-1"">42079 fork lift</a> is much more pleasing.)</p>

<h3>My thoughts</h3>

<p><strong>Pro&#39;s</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Unique set idea</li>
	<li>There are no parts in strange colours used for this model.</li>
	<li>Track - new clever setup for rollers, sturdy, easily attachable by four pins</li>
	<li>Winch - two speed from gear box that doesn&#39;t need surplus of gear wheels</li>
	<li>Cabin - is highly detailed even with opening doors. However, rotation by knobwheel apears too much. Two positions, facing front and back (cf. <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42054-1"">Claas</a>) would have been sufficient.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Con&#39;s</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Loader - while the &#39;grabbing&#39; thing looks impressive, the arm and mechanics just don&#39;t deliver. From side it looks flimsy. To grab a log you have to operate a small lever on the arm itself. I only gave it a few tries until I got disappointed. It just doesn&#39;t work well.<br />
	There is plenty of space within the chassis to have the second function operated from the back. <em>(Did you ever play with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/856-1"">856</a> bulldozer? IMO that has still the best manually operated setup.)</em></li>
	<li>Logs - Are built from 2x2 round bricks. Last years set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42080-1"">42080</a> hat those with profile.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Why</strong>?</p>

<p>I bought the set for parts when it was on 30% discount.</p>

Upon completion, as a seemingly straight forward build i started to notice things. The cab CONSTANTLY moving, the pair of arms that are suppose to grip the &quot;load&quot; constantly letting them slip out...oh? did i mention it cannot seem to grasp its own load, ever. i give +1 for tracks</p>
