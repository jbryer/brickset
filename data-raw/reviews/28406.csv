"beskadberserker","2019-01-04T19:49:41.23Z","Helmet check","<p>I was immediately excited when this set was first revealed. Although I have not played Battlefront II, the Inferno squad detailing looked exquisite to me. So, how did the actual set stack up to my expectations?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>- The identical printing on the three included helmets is excellent</p>

<p>- I was pleasantly surprised to discover that one of these troopers came with a utility belt element, along with another as a spare piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- The inclusion of something besides simple stud shooters for weapons</p>

<p>- All 4 of the included minfig heads are different, it&#39;s not just Versio and three &quot;angry clones&quot;</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>- The helmet mold is the same as the TIE Striker pilot from rogue one. There is a massive gap between the back of the helmet and the top of the torso, leaving a light flesh patch that does not contrast well with the black minifig.</p>

<p>- Unlike the Imperial Patrol battle pack, the included speeder is not something I&nbsp;would care to display. The speeder does not appear anywhere in Star Wars canon from what I can tell, and the set designers could have made something more aesthetically pleasing within the allotted part count. I&#39;m particularly obsessed with including as many control panel/lever elements as I can jam into my builds, so the lack of any such elements in this vehicle disappoints me.</p>

<p>- While the two of the included weapons are not simply stud shooters, all four weapons employ stud shooters in the build. While the rocket launcher looks fine, the other weapon is better off with the stud shooter detached. I&#39;m rather fond of the older blaster rifles and sidearms, and I would greatly appreciate it if Lego would include a few such parts in the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the reason I buy battle packs is the same reason most builders do: As army builders. That&#39;s why, despite my disappointment with the &quot;TIE-inspired speeder&quot;, I only took off a combined 1 star overall, half for the speeder, and half for the unsightly rear of the Inferno Squad helmets. For display, the helmet issue is nothing that can&#39;t be fixed with some plain black minifigure heads, and I knew that I wasn&#39;t going to love the speeder anyway. The stud shooter gripe is more my own personal desire that Lego would consider slightly altering their battle pack approach, as they seem to be considering with the other Spring 2019 battle pack, Praetorian Guard Battle Pack. If you&#39;re a fan of the stud shooters, then you can probably ignore that last con altogether.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Iden Versio</p>

<p>Iden is pretty much a perfect representation of the character. She has all new prints and a new color for Padme&#39;s hair, and she has two faces-- an angry one and a happier one (can imperials ever really be happy?). Unfortunately, Iden does not come with a helmet, but she does have a stud shooter, so... yay...</p>

<p>Inferno Squad Agent 1 (Del Meeko)</p>

<p>LEGO calls this guy a generic name, but he is probably based on Del, because he has more pouches, represented by a black utility belt. He shares his leg print with Iden and the other two figs, and all torsos except Iden&#39;s are the same print, which is based on Hask&#39;s armor. He is equipped with a stud shooter with a loadhailer piece added to the back.</p>

<p>Inferno Squad Agent 2 (Gideon Hask)</p>

<p>This figure is probably based on Gideon, because he has a smaller stud shooter and a a face with cheekbones. He has a standard stud shooter, like Iden.</p>

<p>Inferno Squad Agent 3 (Seyn Marana?)</p>

<p>The fourth agent is canonically Seyn Marana, a female, that died before the events of Battlefront 2. But of course, instead of a suitable face, the set uses the Angry Clone faceprint, which is totally inaccurate and a very odd choice.&nbsp;This Agent is mainly differentiated by his/her gun, being based on a larger rifle, which is built up more bit still has a stud shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The latter 3 members have the same helmet, a tie pilot helmet with red markings, but Iden is helmetless. The set should probably have included an extra.</p>

<p>The Build</p>

<p>The build is a small black, grey, and red speeder that is vaguely tie fighter-like. It has a single seat for a pilot (who gets no controls of any kind), a light bley fin, and trans blue 1x4 engine. The wings are surprisingly well-attached, and don&#39;t fall of even when dropped. The speeder has 6 (!) weapons, two of which shoot studs, with the four other ones being on hinges.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>The set has mostly only common parts besides the figure parts, with very small standouts.</p>

<p>Playability</p>

<p>There is no enemy, because this is a battle pack, and the playability mainly consists of swooshing and firing studs.</p>

<p>Build&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build was short, but fine,&nbsp; with one clever part with the attachment if the wings with technic pieces.</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>This is a good start for making Battlefront 2 minifigures. I would recommend either finding a better face for Seyn, or taking that fig apart to use the helmet for Iden. It would also be nice to get hair for Del and Hask, but wasn&#39;t absolutely needed. The weapons are not the best looking, but at least can fire and two are different than the norm.</p>

<p>I rate this set a 3.75/5.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>I traditionally start from a main build. In this set we got some kind of flying vehicle. I&#39;m not familiar with that design, but LEGO sometimes made up their own concept models. I think this is this case. Ship looks good. I must say it is fascinating&nbsp;design. Wings are angled towards each other. Single curved brick at back makes something like spine or fin. Two long cannon, accompanied by two smaller on wings gives it&nbsp;an aggressive look. Front panel is simple and plain, for me it misses something, seems unfinished. Other missing thing is a control panel of some sort. It could be simple tile, slope, or just a lever.&nbsp;Red panels at sides brighten the ship a lot. Beside that it is done in a combination of greys and black. Worth noticing is also simple yet quite impressive&nbsp;engine made from trans light blue tile.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/bsWlxUtQ5Z-FdOrSBtTebF7PPqwDufkt2DRUoAucSuwQQZF6OjJj3t5JFMyD9NBhsqv6u5JhCNXgXdDR91KTulHmPDuaHe9xoehZ8vMoPYuIxWh6yI0UDOS_5paGdhoRsPLYSoAyrsw=w2400[/img]</p>

<p>Ship can fit one pilot inside. You can also attach his weapon to one of the empty studs between wings. Model is sturdy and easy to play with.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>As always&nbsp;they are the main part of battle packs.</p>

<p>The most important character is&nbsp;<strong>Iden&nbsp;Versio</strong>, leader of Inferno Squad. She is the only named character in this set, and only one with hair on. She has medium nougat&nbsp;skin tone, and pretty simple expression. On her second face she is more angry. Both faces can be used as a face of a standard&nbsp;woman in any type of building. She wears a uniform similar to Tie pilot&#39;s, but with a great looking red marking over a shoulder. She has a shade in the waist, so is the only Tie pilot with a woman shape. Her legs have print of normal trousers with some pockets. Her hair looks great, she has a small bun. She is equipped with normal stud shooter.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Olzi5ufsQ0GR3Uie_SOSc2Ndq2ALOHYrWhHFrC6mEJoc4W0qvY2ftPNNv0g4oLtllJClozugRBA3yz-hB4LMSLS94CTwZWmuN0lPXaKujAceGpXf6AXzYcMEBo1QoL7HU6chiD33v6c=w2400[/img]</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/C0zDAadLHQVYe6tLjvaqhOeiEwTe82skZ4XvyGEkPDu3Jt9WXK8HOqTelhH8KLwXdCPObRsTQfPeXmnPqa0cNUUJcfgyujrftWczNyNEpCjWy2hqbyO18_8HJ1TuTpe2yFfWQRUmvRM=w2400[/img]</p>

<p>Along with her comes three members of Inferno Squad. And there is a small problem. Squad has four members indeed, but they never worn those uniforms. They start to wearing them after the mission on which Seyn&nbsp;Marana died (spoiler). And so, I think it would be better to put some other minifig in this set instead of one of Inferno soldier, for example scout trooper (just an idea).</p>

<p>But back to rest of&nbsp;<strong>Inferno Squad Members</strong>. Their uniforms are nice, mainly they&#39;re black stormtrooper&nbsp;armour&nbsp;with a belt across. One of them has a utility belt. The most distinctive feature of those soldiers are their&nbsp;helmets: Tie pilot helmet with an incredible red markings and visor. I think this is the best part of those figs&#39; design. Good thing is also, that every single fig has different face. We get &quot;angry clone&quot;, one calm, and one with&nbsp;eyes with darker rings around them. As their armament we get one normal gun, one with extended back, and one heavy gun. The last one is designed poorly, and doesn&#39;t appeal&nbsp;to me.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are not so many of them, and they are rather standard. If it comes to more interesting, we have 1x4 trans light blue tile, some curved bricks, and 14 red studs.</p>

"vikings","2020-05-30T06:25:23.43Z","Inferno Squad","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a small box. The dimensions of the box are 7.5 x 5.6 x 1.8 inches and weighs 0.26 pounds. It comes with a small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You don&#39;t really get any&nbsp;cool or unique parts. You get a 1x4 trans blue tile for the engine on the back of the ship. Other than that you don&#39;t get any part that is worth mentioning. The total piece count is 118.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Inferno Squad Soldier:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You get three Inferno Squad Soldiers. All of them have different heads and weapons. One also comes with a black utility belt. You get three different types of heads for the Inferno Squad troopers. One is the traditional Stormtrooper head, another has been used for an Imperial Officer (Specifically in set 75082) and the other is a head used for a rebel soldier (Specifically in set 75155). They all have the same torso, legs, and helmet. The torso has great printing on it, with a strap of some sort (Ammo, gear, or something else, I don&#39;t know exactly) and a belt with a silver buckle. The legs have minor printing of their armor continuing down from the torso. The helmets have great detail on it. They have red eyes with two red Imperial logos on either side of their helmets. They are each armed with a different stud shooter weapon (Which I don&#39;t like at all). One is are with just a stud shooter, another is armed with a stud shooter with a black megaphone attached to the back of it, and the other is a black tap, 1x2x2/3 gun base, 1x2 stud shooter, and scope.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Iden Versio:</strong></p>

<p>Iden Versio is the only Inferno Squad trooper that does not&nbsp;have a helmet. She has black hair and a dark tan singled sided head. She has a neutral&nbsp;facial expression on her face. Her torso has printing on it that somewhat resembles an Imperial pilots body. She also has a belt and the printing of her suit continues down onto her legs as well. She is armed with a stud shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy, there was nothing to it. It took me less than 10 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a really nice battle pack. The figures are amazing with&nbsp;the detail on them. The weapons are not great (Only because of the stud shooters) but the two brick built ones are a little bulky and a few parts fall off, so there are not very sturdy if you play or handle them. The helmets are great and really capture the evilness of the Empire. The build itself is pretty decent. It can only hold one Inferno Squad Trooper as a pilot. It has two heavy cannons on the front and two stud shooters&nbsp;and two smaller cannons on the wings. It is a well armed ship. The two front cannons can move almost 90 degrees to the left and right. The front of the ship moves down to allow easier access to put the pilot in the cockpit. Overall a nice little ship. I highly recommend this battle pack if you are a fan of Battle Front or to add to you Star Wars or Lego Collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigures include four two of the same troopers, one with everything the same but has a utility belt, and last and certainly least is the female who has bun hair instead of a helmet. Next time i do i bricklink order i am going to buy a helmet for her. Aside from the hair instead of helmet thing the Minifigs are fine overall.</p>

<p>The build itself like most battle packs is not amazing but is still neat. It is a speeder bike with a hint of the sith&nbsp;infiltrater&nbsp;and tie advanced prototype.&nbsp;<br />
