"Andersond","2019-01-10T16:18:34.737Z","The New and Improved Droid Gunship","<p>When I saw that this set was coming out this year I was very excited. I missed out on the last two Droid gunships so I finally picked up this set yesterday. The ship overall has been greatly improved on its color and its overall design. It is much sleeker, and has an overall menacing feel to it overall. The set comes with 4 minifigures, Yoda, Tarrful, and 2 of the new Kashyyyk Battle Droids.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minfigures:</p>

<p>Yoda- is perhaps the most boring out of all of these figures, since he is the only one to have come out in several&nbsp;sets. He has a green lightsaber, and has the same printing on the front and on the back and on his head piece as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chief Tarrful- Tarrful&nbsp;has only came in one other set, that was the At-Ap from 2014. That being said, he isn&rsquo;t the exact same version of the figure, from the last set. However he is still a great looking figure, with great printing and a great amount of detail on the front and the back on the figure. Overall a good looking figure.</p>

<p>Battle Droids- these two battle droids are the only new figures in this set. This set and the new At-Ap&nbsp;set. These figures have a dark green stripe and an olive green body. They both are identical and what I was surprised with was that they both came with gun metal gray blasters. These two figures are actually AAT drivers, but on the box they have been labeled with Kashyyyk&nbsp;battle droids.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build,</p>

<p>The build to this set was straight forward and it was easy to follow the steps. There were not&nbsp;too many stickers which is nice since sometimes stickers can be a pain. The overall look to the set once you finish the build is nice.</p>

<p>The set,&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set overall is impressive to look at. The set has gotten rid of all of the regular blue on it and replaced it with proper dark blue. The top of the ship has almost all curved slopes and hardly any studs, which gives the ship a sleek look to it. The front of the ship has a more accurate head with some great looking double barreled cannons. The top of the Droid head can open up so that you can put a Droid minifigure inside. However this is not accurate since the Droid Gunship is a Droid in itself. (Keeper this is not a problem since it is a small part of the ship and you can always leave the droids out as well. The one part of the ship that is a great improvement is the missiles on the bottom of the ship. The two last versions of this ship had a bomb dropping mechanism instead of having missiles like the ship does in the safe wars universe. The way the new missile system&nbsp;works is that all of the missiles are flick fire but instead of flicking them there are these pins that you push that shoots out two missiles at a time. There is still landing gear on the bottom which can still easily&nbsp;fold out and fold in. On the sides there is a cannon which a stud shooter on each side. This looks nice and it is better then having the rods of the spring loader&nbsp;shooter stick out.</p>

<p>Overall,</p>

<p>A lot of people think that this set is bad seeing how this is a remake of the 2014 set and it looks very similar. However that is far from the case. This versions of the ship is sleeker and looks more accurate, then both old sets. My personal opinions on this set is, is that you should buy it the improvement of the missile weapons and the sleeker design as well as a solid selection of minifigures&nbsp;make this set well worth the money. However it is fifty dollars, which is the same amount as the 2014. So while it is expensive, it is on the smaller side as well. However that being said, you are getting an upgraded vehicle and good figures , so in the end you should by this set, and even if you think that it&rsquo;s too much money, then wait for it to go down a little in price. Either way this is a set that will not disappoint.&nbsp;</p>

"Lego_fan_","2020-01-12T13:07:51.01Z","Another gunship?","<p>Lego set #75233 is the perfect addition to any Star Wars collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set contains two Minifigures&nbsp;two battle droid figures, and one droid gunship.</p>

<p>The two minifigures are Yoda who is no different then some previous ones we have seen, and Chief Tarfful&nbsp;who is brand new to this set and includes some nice details like his long braided hair on his back.</p>

<p>The two battle droid figures are actually called &quot;Kashyyyk&nbsp;Battle Droid&quot; and have special paint jobs to hide them in the swamps. These figures are exclusive to this set and the new At-ap&nbsp;walker.</p>

<p>The gunship itself i believe is about 10 or so inches long and has lots of cool detains and functions.</p>

<p>It is like any other gunship made before but it has some details including, newish parts to get the right looking angle, exclusive stickers, and a lot of guns just like the real one.</p>

<p>The play functions are; two twin cannons in the front that are movable however you like, a third cannon in the front that moves up and down, an opening hatch for a Kashyyyk Battle Droid to pilot it, twin sud shootes&nbsp;(on both ends of the ships wings), landing gear that folds down, and eight (four on each side) flick misiels&nbsp;that fire in pairs of two.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My personal favorite function is the Mislies on the bottom. It is good to see those instead of spring loaded shooters.</p>

<p>overall i think this set is fun and a must have for any Star Wars collector.</p>

"wasn","2020-03-08T23:08:08.87Z","Good Represantation of the Droid Gunship","<p>When this set came out many people complained, that this was another Droid Gunship only a couple of years after the last one.But I have to say, that this set&#39;s design shows some improvements.</p>

<p>The biggest one is probably that the proportions of head and body now resemble the source material better.</p>

<p>Also, the air-intake is finally round, but with the downside, that there are now weird edges in the surface of the body.</p>

<p>Together with details like the dual ball-turrets the build is wonderful at conveying the aggressive look of the Gunship it has in ROTS or TCWs.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say much about the playability, but with all the pose-able cannons, the flick-missiles and the stud-shooters it seems to be much fun.</p>

<p>The minifigures are nice with two so called Kashyy-Battle Droids which resemble the tank-driving droids form TCW. Yoda and Tarfull are something every Star Wars collection can use.</p>

<p>Since I missed the previous gunships this was a very good one for me and I definitely don&#39;t regret buying it.</p>
