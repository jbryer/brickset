"Maudib","2019-01-02T01:32:04.017Z","WOW","<p>For an AFOL returning to Lego after a 20 year hiatus, it is awesome to have an opportunity to purchase some of the iconic Clone Wars sets from 3-5 years back without having to look to the secondary market.</p>

<p>Wonderful building experience. Great selection of mini figs, great addition to my growing clone army.</p>

What i do not like about this version is the gap between the top panel and the side panels.<br />
I like the minifigures, the droids are nice.</p>

The minifigures are great, I love the new Kashyyyk Battle Droids, Chewbacca, and can always use another Gree and scout. The walker is really stable on its own, even without the third leg.The in side is good, there is a place to sit 2 troops and a big control panel. I would love to see more walkers like this.&nbsp;</p>

"JarJarBricks","2021-02-05T18:59:57.367Z","Nice Price","<p>This is a nice set for display, and for play as well. This goes well with the turbo tank and any other kashyyyk set you have. It has green markings to represent the 41st elite corps and kashyyyk, so you can&#39;t really use it in any other battles but kashyyyk.</p>

<p>The minifigures in this set include 2 kashyyyk battle droids, which, while incacurate, are still nice to get. It includes clone Commander Gree, and a 41st elite corps clone trooper both with exclusive new leg printing. You also get a chewbacca minifigure, which can add to your wookie army for kashyyyk.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it does not include enough clones to fit all the seats which has been a small problem lately, especially considering the expense of some clones.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The play features in this set include a rotating cannon, a retracting leg, and opening side hatches. The top can lift to access the interior more easily. The back two legs do not move very well, and have no articulation, which is a downside for play. It has a spring-loaded shooter mounted on top of the cannon.</p>

<p>It is not too pricy to get used in 2021, at only 6 dollars more than original retail value. The pricing is low for a star wars set, at 10 dollars less than the piece count, making the price per piece pretty good.</p>

<p>The pieces you get are mostly dark and light blush grey, and some shades of green. Useful pieces include Open Circle insignias, 3&nbsp;unique control panel pieces,&nbsp;and a dark grey hatch sticker on a black 2x2 round tile. Other stickered pieces include a droid gunship diagram on the controls.</p>
