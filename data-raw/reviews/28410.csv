"RaiderOfTheLostBrick","2020-01-14T00:41:28.8Z","A pretty decent set... for 4+.","<p>As far as the 4+ Star&nbsp;Wars ships go, they are a mixed bag. I&rsquo;d say the X-Wing looks the worst, while the Tie Fighter and just released Snowspeeder fare&nbsp;slightly better. The only one of the series that I own is the A-Wing, which I consider to be the best of the line. Why?</p>

<p>The Good:</p>

<p>The best part of this set is how faithful this looks to the actual ship. While it is heavily &lsquo;juniorised&rsquo;, it&rsquo;s still more recognisable and less simplistic than other ships in the line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The side build, a wall of the Yavin 4 base with tool rack is also appealing especially since we hardly ever get sets based on this location.</p>

<p>The minifigures aren&rsquo;t exclusive, but good to get nonetheless. The relatively cheap price means that fans on a budget can get&nbsp;decent figures of C-3PO and an A-Wing pilot.</p>

<p>The Mixed:&nbsp;</p>

<p>At only 62 pieces and a price of $20 AUD, this isn&rsquo;t a great deal, even though 4+ sets tend to have larger pieces, which increases the price.</p>

<p>While I did say that the A-Wing translates to 4+ style well, it still appears quite blocky but this set mostly appeals to young kids anyway, so I can partly forgive it.</p>

<p>The Bad:</p>

<p>The only real&nbsp;bad thing about this set is the lack of play features. Even though I would be surprised to set firing blasters in here, the X-Wing and Snowspeeder both had some. Considering that this set is for young kids, the absence of missiles, exploding features or even a Stormtrooper seems odd.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>Out of the 4+ sets for Star Wars, The A-Wing is by far the best. The vehicle is recognisable even in this style (if not perfect) and the figures appeal to fans on a budget. The price is pushing it a little but isn&rsquo;t much of an issue. Therefore I&rsquo;ll give this set a 3/5. Recommended&nbsp;if you can find it on sale.</p>
