"Maudib","2019-01-01T18:17:30.24Z","Dewbak on parade","<p>I will admit, I was initially skeptical about a brick built Dewback. Boy was I proved wrong. What a fun build, and this is to not take away anything from the escape pod build. This Dewback was fun to build and works well with my Mos Eisley Cantina set. Probably going to pick up 3 more over the season to create some awesome desert skirmishes.</p>

"Orange_Jooze","2019-02-13T08:52:11.28Z","A pleasant surprise","<p>I&#39;ll be honest, I only bought this set for the Sandtrooper&nbsp;fig and R2-D2. I&#39;m not a fan of Microfighters as sets, but I do appreciate the opportunity to get great figs at a lower price.</p>

<p>This set, however, has a wonderful highlight in the form of the Dewback. While the escape pod is not anything impressive and will soon be disassembled and added to my parts collection, I have found myself unable to do the same with this green cutie. It&#39;s a fun build, it&#39;s to scale with the minifig, and the moving head and tail bits have an impressive degree of flexibility, making it very expressive.</p>

<p>In fact, I&#39;m looking at my&nbsp;molded Dewback from&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4501-1/Mos-Eisley-Cantina"">4501 Mos Eisley Cantina</a></strong>&nbsp;and I like it much less than this one because it just looks so out of place next to brick-built objects.</p>

<p>The minifigs themselves are pretty good: there isn&#39;t much to say about C-3PO and R2-D2, as they are some of the most common SW minifigs&nbsp;ever and have appeared in plenty of sets.<br />
The Sandtrooper&nbsp;is pretty great, although the brick-built backpack is a bit wonky and made of two unconnected halves which often detach if you don&#39;t treat him gently. His helmet uses the new 2019 Stormtrooper mold, which admittedly looks much better than the old one, but it&#39;s going to be hard to get used to such a drastic change in appearance. It&#39;s also a bit of disappointment that his legs are only printed halfway through like all other trooper figs; the sandtroopers&nbsp;from <strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/9490-1/Droid-Escape"">9490 Droid Escape</a></strong>&nbsp;still remain the best iteration of those characters.</p>

<p>All in all, this is a great, cheap set that includes two iconic characters, an extra trooper (can never have too much of those!), and an absolutely wonderful minifig-scale creature build. I would also appreciate the fact that this set has been released so recently after&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75205-1/Mos-Eisley-Cantina""><strong>75205&nbsp;Mos Eisley Cantina</strong></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75173-1/Luke-s-Landspeeder"">75173&nbsp;Luke&#39;s Landspeeder</a></strong>: all three sets are still available on the market and together make up a complete diorama of the Mos Eisley&nbsp;scene in Episode IV (sans Dr. Evazan and Ponda Baba).</p>

"J0rgen","2019-02-15T11:09:28.74Z","These are the droids you are looking for!","<p>I haven&#39;t reviewed a set in a long time, but this was such a great little set that I had to! I have never liked Micro Fighters much, as they are neither proper scale models of anything in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, or accurate mini models of ships.&nbsp;The few micro fighters I have wanted have been because of desirable minifigs, not the models. This set, however, I wanted because of both.</p>

<p>Unlike many people, I don&#39;t have a lot of modern incarnations of C-3PO and R2-D2, so I was happy to add one more of each to my collection, and while I wasn&#39;t that keen on the new sandtrooper because of the updated helmet (and also because sandtroopers were perfected in the 2012<em> Droid Escape </em>set), when I saw it in person, I didn&#39;t mind the new&nbsp;design after all.</p>

<p>While the minifigures were good, the stars of this set are (as they should be) the builds. The escape pod is a very nice mini version of the pod from the film, and the little&nbsp;dewback is adorable. The set includes one instruction book for each build, which is perfect for siblings or friends who can build one model each at the same time. Both models use some fun techniques and some (at least to me) new and interesting pieces. I find&nbsp;that Micro Fighters and battle packs seldom have interesting pieces or good builds, so to have both here is really satisfying. The set cost only 169 NOK at the store where I bought it, so it felt like really good value, but I think I would have been equally happy about it for LEGO&#39;s price of 199 NOK.</p>

<p>Unlike any of the&nbsp;previous Micro Fighters&nbsp;these two models will actually make it into my Star Wars displays, in the background of my Tatooine&nbsp;landscape. This version of the escape pod is better than the 2001 and 2012 scale versions, and will look very nice as a background detail, and I think this&nbsp;dewback&nbsp;rivals the moulded one from 2014&#39;s Mos Eisley&nbsp;Cantina because it is one of the best looking brick built creatures I have seen.</p>

<p>Many collectors will probably prefer the scale versions from 2014 and 2016 respectively, as they look more like their on-screen counterparts, but for kids, this is the absolute best way to get both the escape pod and a dewback. The escape pod is a pretty minor and kind of boring vehicle, so&nbsp;representing the scene in this small, fun, playable and not too expensive&nbsp;set (rather than yet another normal scale one) was a very good idea. 5/5</p>

"KarolWes","2019-04-13T16:20:47.707Z","Cutest lizard ever seen","<p>Main reason I bought this set was, I want to have a new sandtrooper (mine from 2010 or so looks really poor). And because I wanted this dewack. On pics it looks really nice and I have to have it on my own.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>Model contains two parts: dewback and escape pod (see: name of set). From the first bag of parts You can build a pod. It&#39;s really small, but still looks great. Is more-less rounded, has nicely detailed engines (lot of them). there is a seat inside for one minifig and dedicated spot to put&nbsp;R2 on. I especially like the usage of skate parts as a maneuverable&nbsp;engines. Whole round-ish look of craft add a lot. At the bottom there is a some kind of ski for landing. Craft is mostly light gray, with some silver details and a ring in dark tan.</p>

<p>Second we get a dweback. From the outside it is mostly sand green, though inside it is really a mashup of colors. It has some small additions in dark green and its paws are tan. This animal looks adorable. I&#39;m sure this is one of the best thing LEGO gives us this year. On top there is a little seat, saddle&nbsp;for stormtrooper&nbsp;in brown, with two &quot;sacks&quot; on sides. On a head there are two printed eyes.</p>

<p>Both models are super stable and sturdy. Only weaker part of a model are dewback&#39;s foot.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot building on side - &quot;panels&quot; for creature, and whole pod. Though it isn&#39;t anything special. They are really simple.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Functions</strong></p>

<p>There are a few of them. To be honest, only one is, that you can move around head and tail of lizard. And of course you can fly around with craft and adjust the thrusters. It&#39;s not a lot.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Dewback, as I said is done in sand green. And so, we get many parts in this color, some really useful, like wedged plates, curved bricks. At the other hand, there are a few standard parts - mostly plates. But this adds a lot to value of set.</p>

<p>Because both models has a lot things attached to sides, is set there are many bricks with studs on side, the best of which are this with 1 2/3 in hight - rather new parts, but quite popular because of the Brickheadz.</p>

<p>Between&nbsp;other nice parts there are skates in silver, 1x1 plate with stud on side, tiles with printed eye, which seems to be very useful in MOCs.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>There are three minifigures in this set:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Sandtrooper&nbsp;- Very clean looking fig, with new mold for helmet (just like rest of troops). Really like the dirt-like painting on helmet and whole body (even on back). He gets&nbsp;fine pauldron&nbsp;in orange with some darker prints. On torso there is also an additional print of some kind of pocket. Except that, printing is standard. Face is typical - &quot;angry clone&quot;. He gets his backpack on the newer type of attachment. It is very simple. As an equipment he has staff, long rifle and macrobinocular. Overall he looks nice and I don&#39;t see any flaws.[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/2bN2nS6yPEq8-U__6xil2iqDHxlyhmR0JN6Dxlq73xlgPioMwEOl6U810o9fyJp0DYmn_pqr83XkJXnxKEyv948erPLXs_U-WY6i_AfpwaTzj0oA_pfZXULQSCCNpbrs8Fanrlhl2UThEyNh1mLdOAVfZNySnNm9Ynpe64H6CquPfQwQ1QiQ7yx2nhQe_tEOtLFU-o4xiwdZqf8_1Bhq4sM3STQL5PtqC4D9AeCE4HY4rfz1JUZccRXYB_jFLJOJvJ5WruPHURMOq-SA9dTKBgL2pFR2yW_wZ8Pv6cRXWYGsAiBD25BnB4wk6-I66jyhz-9Nq2EH-itrZNBOCmD9ToGqIqC8eYhp6k0K2HLfe2Ft26abdrtHxdgmxEn2dZNnM1jJVQgSIcjEY2raIbOaJGNSB1ckqoj35FVVTShrkI0N0PGDhP6Y8O_lerFwkws6v9VOFLXUknL7EBmKE-iGnWaAqxDWg-EeB2kZfwg9cgfaCksV_t-QbPum366QDsttIm7k4Mp9GyFubDp9Ml-5j-ZC8tFYRrG_705ae2pRcFMujSSBVTEjHvmLz72i6_jmEiXVsWQZmJa4s7C4DCLlLz8DZUGkm1ppWmfB3LFf-VgvK2AhdNF0cvq9kocgbiQofpsZRRJvih0RAPi8MOpGJKYZAmWnjXsu=w705-h939-no[/img]</li>

"East64","2019-06-07T18:14:19.91Z","My favorite microfighter set so far","<p>I&#39;m a bit addicted to these microfighter sets, but this one was a total surprise for me. Really great work for both builds from lego.</p>

<p><strong>The escape pod is fantastic!&nbsp;</strong>Really fun to put together with its vertical structure, the way in which they achieve detailing on such a small scale is really fun and the engine area is just a treat. I wasn&#39;t expecting much from this but the process of putting this together was actually my favorite of the whole microfighters line and ended up bing the best display model as well because of its realism and the detailing they&#39;ve achieved</p>

<p><strong>The dewback is fun too,&nbsp;</strong>especially if you like brick built animals. The saddle area in particular is well done from both an building standpoint and for display since it allows for additional accessories for the trooper (set comes with a cattle prod, binoculars, and a gun for him).&nbsp;The nostrils are the only open studs exposed which is very clever. The eyes are a bit too chibi for me and I wish it had a mouth, but you can only get so much at this scale</p>

<p><strong>Minifig selection is excellent</strong>, I really just wanted the C3PO which is really well printed with the exposed wires on teh stomach and its head is very accurate. I know R2D2 in the movie has a white body with a silver head, but at minifig scale it looks a bit off. Sand trooper is very cool, good accessories included and well printed.</p>

<p><strong>Overall,&nbsp;</strong>this set was a pleasant surprise since I bought it mostly for the minifigs and the main builds ended up being very fun. The shuttle in particular is just fantastic, I can&#39;t speak highly enough about how much I like it and how detailed it looks compared to the rest of this line. If you like microfighters but hesitated on this since it doesn&#39;t actually include any fighters, I think you&#39;ll be pleasantly surprised how much you like this.</p>

"Bogdan501st","2020-06-05T11:27:13.67Z","Surprisingly Good","<p>So it was a Sunday afternoon and my family and I were about to go shopping. And it came to my mind that I wanted to build a new LEGO set! After analysing the others, I decided to buy this one.&nbsp; It was well after Christmas and I hadn&#39;t built a set in months.</p>

<p>I find it really cool that they include two instruction booklets, so that one can build the Escape Pod, while the other builds the Dewback. Or you can build both of them yourself, as I did ;).</p>

<p>Anyway, the builds are surprisingly good and I found them both very satisfying. I started with the Escape Pod, which features a SNOT technique. The way the two droids fit is just&nbsp;<em>perfect</em>.</p>

<p>The Dewback is very accurate, while still keeping the Microfighters feel to it. I missed the 2014&nbsp;<em>Mos Eisley Cantina</em>&nbsp;and I very much regret that, so this is the only Dewback I have ever had. Unfortunately, the legs aren&#39;t poseable, but they look really good(actually, you can pose the feet a little and you can change their orientation - though it requires taking the legs apart - ,&nbsp;if you like, so I guess that counts). However, both the head and the tail are on a Mixel ball joint, so they are&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;poseable.</p>

<p>As for the minifigures, I love the Sandtrooper. At the time of writing this, he is unique to this set. In my opinion, all the new Star Wars helmets( including the Snowtrooper, Darth Vader, Scout Trooper and Stormtrooper) look gorgeous and are far better than the previous. Yeah, I&#39;ve got thousands of R2-D2s and C-3POs, but they are very appropriate for this set.</p>

<p>All in all, I was very pleasantly surprised by this set and I do recommend you picked it up.</p>
