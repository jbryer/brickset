<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>As a recreation of a very sleek ship form Star Wars Universe, this very bulky craft looks kinda weak. It is way too high in comparison to its length. Also, engines has much bigger radius to its length. They are missing that sort of long antennas that should be attached to the back of the engines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That&#39;s in terms of complaints. I think this set makes a pretty good job as it is. It has most of the characteristics, that naboo fighter should have. It features its typical long tail, which looks great in this scale, Engines are done weird as I mentioned before, but overall looks quite good. If you look at the ship from top, it seems OK.</p>

<p>Very small canopy is designed for a short fig, but still manage to include a console, which I always love to see. Two flick-fire missiles looks not so bad, mostly because its tips are done in bright green, which is quite an unusual color. Artoo head behind the canopy looks awfully big, but I still think it&#39;s a good addition</p>

<p>Overall, despite the fact this ship is not a material for making a microfighter, Lego done this job pretty well, not destroying a thin balance between good sleek ship and bulky chibi version of its.</p>

<p><strong>Minifig</strong></p>

<p>There is only one fig in this set: Young Anakin. I think this fig, though it&#39;s very simplistic in design, looks astonishing. He is all done in tan, with a simple print of his robe. He has also a belt both on the front and the back of his torso. At the front there is a great print of his straw necklace. He has a nice print on his face with some freckles. On one side there is a very enthusiastic expression, on the other &mdash; focused and quite angry.</p>

<p>He&#39;s wearing a classic pilot cap with goggles, and is equipped with wrench.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There is really very few of them, even considering other microfighters. But still, a couple of the is good and useful.&nbsp;4x3 nose part in gray is great, a pair of round 2x2 with holes is also quite useful. There is many yellow brick, which are always appreciated .</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Set is good. Not bad, not great, just good. If you manage to get it on some promo, its good. I think it is not worth its retail price, but if it could be a bit cheaper, it would be a great little set.</p>
