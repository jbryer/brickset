However, as someone who has been collecting them since 2014, I can say that the Sunset Track Racer is by far the best among them, hands down. Read on to find out why.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>While the pieces in this set are nothing to write home about (save for those snazzy 1x2 cutout arches,) the color scheme is absolutely phenomenal. There&#39;s a healthy selection of dark blue elements in this set, which makes for a nice change of pace from the typically bold colors in Creator vehicles.</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p>The last time I had this much fun building a set was with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31017-1/Sunset-Speeder"">31017-1 Sunset Speeder</a>, the set that brought me out of my five year dark age. As such, I went ahead and put together all three set builds.</p>

<p>The alternative builds, as expected, felt less complex and fulfilling than the main build. The powerboat in particular wasn&#39;t very structurally sound until quite a ways in, and as such had to be put back together often until more parts were added.</p>

<p>The main build, while solid as a rock, doesn&#39;t have much in the way of complex building techniques. Unlike the complicated building every which way found in Speed Champions cars, most of the fun in building this set came from watching the car&#39;s smooth curves take shape, which we&#39;ll get to later. The main frame is also rather hollow, but this makes sense when factoring in the 20 USD price point (as well as the fact that racecars are <em>supposed</em> to be lightweight.)</p>

<p><strong>The completed model</strong></p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, I built all three models from this set and will give a sub-review of each one.</p>

<p>While it&#39;s unreasonable to expect too much from a C build (or even a B build,) the powerboat model seemed really half-baked. Along with seeming like a mishmash of orange and blue, the most glaring flaw was an unsightly gap right in the middle of the nose. Although this could easily be filled by two leftover orange bows for a much smoother appearance, this solution apparently didn&#39;t occur to the set designer. As far as playability, it doesn&#39;t do much except sail across carpets or blankets thanks to the slider pieces on the bottom of the hull.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt=""See? Isn't that much better?"" src=""https://imgur.com/0lCCQ64.jpg"" style=""width: 728px; height: 354px;"" /></p>

<p>The vintage racecar doesn&#39;t fare too much better. While the build is much more fun and complete, the model itself just looks <em>wrong</em> for what it&#39;s supposed to be. It seems to be going for a mid 20th century Formula One or Indycar style, but the car is just too short and wide to look right. Compared to those sleek, cigar-shaped racers, this thing just looks <em>stumpy</em>.</p>

<p>The main build, however, is where the real magic of this set happens.</p>

<p>This racing car takes all the right notes from the Speed Champions theme, with curves that would make the Senna jealous. The fenders give the car a rounded, aerodynamic figure perfectly evoking recent Le Mans prototype racers. The car&#39;s rear end showcases this perfectly, bringing together cheese slopes and 1x2 bows to neatly tie together the rear fenders. The dark blue triangular flags on either side of the cockpit also certainly help smooth out the car&#39;s profile as well as giving a nice splash of color to the sides. Similarly, the dark blue spoiler piece on the front bumper gives the nose a sleek, modern appearance.</p>

<p>While not as cool as the convertible roof on 31046-1, the opening canopy is nice and functional, and its simple connection means that it is easily removed to create an open-top racer.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Compared to its price range brethren, the Sunset Track Racer is sort of a runt of the litter. The Brickset page erroneously lists it as a 10-wide car, but it&#39;s actually only 8 wide when ignoring the track width. This makes it the smallest of the cars at this price range, but it has more than enough style and substance to make up for it.</p>

<p>All in all, this is an absolutely fantastic set for the price. For only 5 USD more than an average Speed Champions set, you get a larger car packed with great parts that look even better when put together. Not only does it look fantastic as a display piece, it also rolls fast and smooth, making it a fun play set as well. If you&#39;re looking for something bigger than a Speed Champion but don&#39;t quite have the desk space for a Creator Expert car, I highly recommend that you buy this set yesterday.</p>
