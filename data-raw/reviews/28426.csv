"Taggerung1","2019-06-03T05:06:05.23Z","Great parts, pretty cool model!","<p>31086 Futuristic Flyer is a very cool little set that I picked up for $20 Canadian.&nbsp; While this is pretty pricey for the number of parts in the set, I think that the nature of those parts helps offset that a little.&nbsp; There are a lot of really cool parts in this set: Wings in various types and colours, fins, hinges and so on.&nbsp; A lot of them are newer parts too, that I didn&#39;t have any of before, so it&#39;s cool to get my hands on some of them in such a small set!</p>

<p>The main model is a cool looking aircraft that&#39;s somewhat reminiscent of the Russian SU-47 Berkut, an experimental jet fighter.&nbsp; This model differs though, in that it has angled tail fins, and one HUGE booster on the back.&nbsp; The colour scheme is really nice too, dark red, white, and light grey all being very useful colours.</p>

<p>The B-models for this set are, in my opinion, pretty mediocre.&nbsp; There&#39;s a spaceship and a robot.&nbsp; The spaceship looks decent, but it seems to be very straightforward design and construction.&nbsp; The robot appears to be just for the sake of having a robot, because all the Creator sets seem to need one of those.&nbsp; However, its inclusion did result in one of the coolest things in the set.&nbsp; Once you&#39;ve built the main model, there will be pieces left over.&nbsp; Not the typical extras that are always in Lego sets, but a selection of small ball-and-socket joints that are good for making mechs and creatures.&nbsp; Very cool to have some extras of those!</p>

<p>One of the main reasons I bought this set was because its design makes it a good companion for sets 31042 Super Soarer, and 31057 Air Blazer.&nbsp; It looks great sitting next to them, and the fact that it has landing gear to keep it off the ground a bit helps too.&nbsp; Unfortunately, it&#39;s &quot;swooshability factor&quot; is slightly less than those other two, because the placement of the wings and fins make it hard to hold comfortably.&nbsp; (Smaller fingers might have an easier time)&nbsp; That said, its shape still looks cool swooshing around, and that massive booster engine on the back makes it feel like a powerful rocket plane!</p>

<p>If you&#39;re looking for a cool airplane to fly around, or if you&#39;re looking for some good airplane and joint parts, this set is a fairly good option.</p>

<h3>Pros:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Great selection of basic, useful, and rare/new parts</li>
	<li>Looks cool by itself or with other, similar sets</li>
	<li>Reasonably swooshable</li>
	<li>Extra pieces for alternate models</li>
</ul>

<h3>Cons:</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Mediocre alternate models</li>
	<li>Pricey, at least in Canada, for the 157 parts you get</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Model I - futuristic plane</strong></p>

<p>First model is some kind of plane with wing angled to the front and big fire coming out from engine. On a box it is placed in the space, so we could assume it is not only a plane, but also a spacecraft.</p>

<p>Model looks pretty great. Angled forward wings looks brilliant&nbsp;and add a lot of futuristic vibe to it. Plane has also two big rudders and some small winglets, that can be moved up and down. Nose at the front is simple but looks nice, as well as canopy build out of old canopy pieces. Engine at the back is extremely big, which looks ok. I don&#39;t usually like landing gears that cannot be hide, but in here they match the model really well.</p>

<p>Color scheme used in this model is fantastic. I like models in dark red, and in this set we get a lot of parts in this color. Details in white match&nbsp; perfectly to gray and red body. Model is very sleek, looks very much aerodynamic, like it could exist in real world, in near future.</p>

<p><strong>Model II - spacecraft</strong></p>

<p>For the first glance this craft looks weird, especially when you look at the image on instruction manual. But when you built it, it become a great spaceship model. Again landing gears are not the best, but don&#39;t disturbed&nbsp;look of model. Two long spikes at the front look great, I like usage of rudder parts as a wings. Jumper part used as some details on a fuselage looks amazing. Back section with engines also is designed pretty good.</p>

<p><strong>Model III - robot</strong></p>

<p>Version of robot given as a third model is not the best. It looks so bulky and fat. Backpack with wings and engines is lot too big. But luckily it is easy to remove. Without it robot looks great. It is very poseable, and very stable. I like the way they designed head and small emblem made out of silver teeth part. Though it is the smallest and the weakest model of this set, it still is nice.</p>

<p><strong>Buildings</strong></p>

<p>Building process was rather straight forward, with some details and panel mounted on side. But there is one interesting building technic that allow to make wings in first model - they are attached on ball joints.</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>As I said there are lot of dark red parts, but most valuable in this set are wings. Many types and many length. Also worth noticing are rudders, cut curved bricks and inverted curves.</p>

	<li>Lot of dark red parts</li>
	<li>Huge amount of wedged plates</li>
