<p>The build was difficult enough to be testing for his age but any 7 or 8 year old would breeze though and still enjoy the build (i would lol)</p>

<p>Smooth running gear makes a good model that crosses over into technic range (which my lad keeps hankering after)</p>

<p>&nbsp;5/5 from me great value at &pound;17.99&nbsp;</p>

<p>More like this please Lego</p>

You get several extra 1x1 white round studs that are for the rapid fire stud shooter mounted to the back of the snow cat as well as a few extras to serve as snow for to push with the front mounted blade. The blade doesn&#39;t attach very well to the frame under the front of the snow cat and can come detached easily while going in reverse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Could be a good addition if making a snow/winter village and you have a ski slope or maybe a road to clear snow from.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another possibility is to take off the large red plate&nbsp;that the cab and shooter is mounted to and it&#39;s the track base is ready to start a MOC tank or other tracked vehicle like a dozer.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-19T23:20:10.48Z","Oddly Amusing Gem.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #60222 Snow Groomer:</b> Rather than being called a Plow, which most people might be more familiar with, this particular set is known as the Snow Groomer and is basically used to clear LEGO City streets of snow. Although certain LEGO City skiers might want to watch out, as this vehicle comes equipped with a stud launcher to defend itself from crazy stuntwomen.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a typical LEGO City set, with a standard box and manual design. The box shows a nice action shot on the front, includes the main female character in the top corner and shows off the features on the back, while the manual itself is very well put together and easy to follow along with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set, being a City set contains mostly regular coloured bricks and other elements. There are a lot of track parts for the treads of the Snow Groomer, but there aren&rsquo;t really any truly outstanding or unique new elements with this City set. You will find a stud launcher in the set though as well as a few CMF stands being used for the shovel, which are not unique, but not often found in ordinary LEGO City sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Driver: Also known as the Snow Groomer Operator according to the official information, this is a typical beanie wearing LEGO City Minifigure. The torso is printed with a construction worker motif, orange with a single metal stripe running across the chest, but this one has a hood detail visible on front and back and is obviously from the Arctic theme for winter exploration. At least I believe this torso would be similar to the Arctic Sub-Theme Minifigures. A single coffee mug is placed inside the cab when building the Groomer, this is his accessory more-than-likely.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Skier: Again the print here shows off a winter themed jacket, back and front, this Minifigure has the X-Treme Team logo located on her torso, so she&rsquo;s a member of this fantastical stunt team. Her face is single-sided with goggles covering the eyes and a nice smile, her accessories include two teal skies and a pair of ski poles.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: The driver and skier hop to it as you construct the lower portion of the vehicle. This has a lot of repetition as you will be building both treads, it&rsquo;s a fairly quick and fun little build though and no stickers are used here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: The large cab section with stud launcher is built here, you will be using stickers now for limited detailing on the model. Overall this build can be quick and painless, even with the use of stickers as it shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult to place them on the bricks and window elements. Although I will caution you to get help here if you need it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Snow Groomer is a solid looking model with very impressive treads which allow it to move freely. The front end has a large shovel on the front, or whatever else you&rsquo;d care to call it, which is used to push snow around. It&rsquo;s an extremely fun looking vehicle and part of the X-Treme Team&rsquo;s motor pool, at least according to the stickered decals added to the model. I do not pretend to know if this is the older X-Treme Team from LEGO Town/City, of if it is merely a spiritual successor, but apparently this isn&rsquo;t used to clear streets. At least not only.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The driver pushes snow around and launches snowballs out of the stud launcher located on top, possibly for stunt skiing. I would think it would just be a simple little vehicle doing a daily chore at winter time in LEGO City, but as is typical of such sets in the Theme we find there is a much different idea behind the story for younger builders to play out once finished building.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;m quite a fan of this set. It&rsquo;s simple and fun and the build is very enjoyable, also it&rsquo;s a nice change of pace from the usual LEGO City based fire and police sets. Which is why I typically aim to pick up the more unique offerings from LEGO City. That being said I do wish there was an extra model included for the Skier to use to ride alongside with. Maybe a small car or snowmobile from the X-Treme Team she uses when traveling to the shows. I also feel like this set could have used at least a Third Minifigure to stand or sit with the cannon to pretend to be launching the studs/snowballs at the stunt person.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Still this was a solid set from LEGO City 2019 and I&rsquo;d still recommend it. Definitely worth tracking down if you can, but perhaps wait until after the Social Distancing and other issues are over. Recommended.</p>
