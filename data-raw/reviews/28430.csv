Don&#39;t worry, I know it&#39;s below the age limit but he never puts toys in his mouth and we always supervise when he plays Lego. This is part of the &#39;&#39;Beginners&#39;&#39; collection as it is easy to build and has not many pieces.</p>

<p>This is a fun little set. The firetruck is the main attraction and the most fun to build. The bottom frame of the vehicule is one part which helps the easiness of building it for little kids. The best part is the manlift which is easy and fun to operate. The BBQ is also a cute little part to build. The minifigs are really fun. The BBQ guy has a two-face option (happy and scared) which is something I never saw before. I&#39;m kind of new with the current generation of legos as before last year I had&#39;nt bought or received any new sets since the early 90&#39;s.</p>

<p>So it is a little cute self-explanatory sets for beginners and my son has a lot of fun with it. The hot-dog is a nice touch. I even got an extra wiener in the set which was a fun bonus.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was my first build. It wasn&#39;t too hard. The tiny hot-dogs were very hard to hold, but beyond that it was good. I was able to complete in one sitting. I love the moving parts.&nbsp;</p>
