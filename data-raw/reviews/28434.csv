While he does like playing with Hot Wheels, toy cars aren&#39;t really his thing. I think it Has to do mainly with the technic build and parts that he just isn&#39;t very familiar with. He has a number of Star Wars sets with some technic in the build which he usually has me do for him, but an all technic build with very strange parts has really gotten him excited.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>To make the set even better, it is a police car. While he isn&#39;t interested in cars, he does like police and fire fighters a lot. It also has a pull back function which means that he gets a &quot;new toy&quot; to play with after building it.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was afraid that when he got it the technic build would overwhelm him, but he opened it in the morning and when I got home from work it was fully assembled and he was incredibly proud of it. All I had to do was apply the stickers for him.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>He also got a similar technic race car set like this,&nbsp;which he tried to build but must of missed a peg in the first step so half way thru the build he got stuck and couldn&#39;t move on. As a result he had me build it for him and the rest of the night we raced the two cars around the house.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The car is very sturdy, sturdy enough that my 3 year old daughter could play with it as well and nothing broke off of it. We did notice that after about the 30th crash one peg piece fell off a peg so it needed a minor repair, but it was obvious to my son how to make that repair.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a great set for kids. It is nothing like the technic sets I had as a kid where it was mostly bricks held together with a little bit of technic, this is a strictly technic construction. As a result, there aren&#39;t really any useful pieces in this set unless you are good at designing technic builds (which I&#39;m not), but that hardly matters as my son loves this set the way it is. Although only time will tell how long that lasts, his favorite thing to do with Lego sets is modify them which he won&#39;t be able to do with this set.&nbsp;</p>
