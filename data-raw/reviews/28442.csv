"LegoSonicBoy","2019-01-26T16:31:40.857Z","More than just an overpriced box of basic bricks","<p>Based on the product photography and the contents, you would believe that <strong>70825 Queen Watevra&#39;s Build Whatever Box!</strong> is just a LEGO Classic brick box with The LEGO Movie 2 branding slapped on. And you would not be wrong. That&#39;s exactly what this set is intended to be: a free-building set of colorful basic bricks, plates and slopes to build dozens of various forms that the shapeshifting Queen Watevra Wa&#39;Nabi can take (and does during the movie proper).</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why there&#39;s a general aversion and even contempt toward these types of sets among AFOLs, but ever since this set was revealed and subsequently released, I&#39;ve not heard a single positive comment about it from anyone but myself. I&#39;ve only heard negative comments from others ranging from &quot;not worth talking about even for a minute&quot; to &quot;horrible&quot;. And I strongly disagree &mdash; which is why I&#39;m writing this exclusive Brickset review, to give the Brickset community a chance to understand this set and give it the consideration it deserves.</p>

<p>And yes, as you might glean from the overall rating, I love this set, but I&#39;ll do my best to be objective and avoid bias where possible. Keep in mind that I&#39;m writing this review as someone who genuinely enjoys LEGO Classic sets for what they are, but I&#39;ll also be evaluating the value of this set both in general and as a parts pack. In fact, just to get it out of the way, I&#39;ll say it right now:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>If you&#39;re in it to build and rebuild the Queen, g</strong><strong>et it at a discount</strong>; heck, get it at a discount after you&#39;ve seen the movie if you prefer. Fun as it is, it&#39;s still an overpriced, glorified LEGO Classic set. Much of the premium cost is attributed to the licensing and the sheer production value that went into it (and that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to cover in my review). No one wants to shoulder that extra cost, so I definitely recommend a discount. I got it for my 27th birthday earlier this month at 25% off, and I love it.</li>
	<li><strong>If you&#39;re in it for the parts alone, it&#39;s not worth it.</strong> You can probably BrickLink at least two copies of this set worth of parts including the teal brick separator and minus the exclusive printed parts (which aren&#39;t going to interest most builders anyway) for the same amount of money. If you want the printed parts, wait for a deeper discount.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Building experience - 4/5</h2>

<p>The building experience of this set is truly unlike any other Classic set or brick bucket LEGO has made, because it&#39;s so wonderfully premium. The first thing you&#39;ll notice about the box, if you&#39;ve seen it in stores, is the fact that it&#39;s the same premium flip-top box that&#39;s used in LEGO Architecture sets and previous LEGO Ideas sets. LEGO really wants you to keep this box around.</p>

<p>The front of the box displays a pile of bricks, as well as six possible forms of Queen Watevra Wa&#39;Nabi. While the &quot;Pictured models cannot be built simultaneously&quot; statement is technically correct (and probably there for CYA purposes), the five models shown above the brick pile <em>are</em> designed to be built simultaneously &mdash; it&#39;s only the shapeshifting Queen&#39;s brick pile form shown in the foreground that cannot also be built at the same time because it uses parts from one of the five.</p>

<p>You&#39;ll also notice the &quot;Inspiration Inside&quot; emblem along with a picture of what seems to be a poster. Yes, it&#39;s a poster, in full poster size. Yes, it contains inspiration models &mdash; 16 of them, <strong>in addition to</strong> the 15 models that instructions are provided for, <strong>no download required</strong>.</p>

<p>Each instruction booklet is essentially its own 3-in-1 set of instructions associated with one of 5 numbered bags. This gives you the total of 15 I mentioned. The 16 inspirational models require mixing parts from different bags, so this is one of the few LEGO sets that strongly encourage you to mix parts from different numbered bags to build, after you&#39;re done building according to the numbered bags.</p>

<p>As you can imagine, the set consists almost entirely of upward stacking of bricks and plates. There are some basic SNOT and Technic bricks to provide a bit of variety, but there&#39;s nothing in the way of even moderately advanced techniques. This is very intentionally a &quot;back to basics&quot; building set that requires you to get creative using only the most basic of parts and shapes, calling back to the 70s and earlier era where those were indeed all we had. Me, personally, I love it. I am always impressed by advanced techniques but don&#39;t want to be too spoiled, and this is a nice way to keep myself grounded.</p>

<p>Somewhat disappointingly, it&#39;s not possible to build the Queen&#39;s horse form exactly as seen in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70824-1"">70824 Introducing Queen Watevra Wa&#39;Nabi</a>. Some of the colors will be different, which isn&#39;t that much of an issue; more critically, there is no printed inverted slope piece for the mouth, and the printed eyes are totally different. You can build the exact shape, though. And given the Queen&#39;s nature, the use of different colors is totally by design &mdash; the models in this set that appear in the movie all use slightly different colors anyway.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a fan of Queen Watevra Wa&#39;Nabi and her shapeshifting antics, you will love building and rebuilding her as anything you can imagine. Some custom builds I&#39;ve made using parts from each numbered bag include a megaphone, a kettle, a basket, a piranha, and a high-heeled shoe. Some I&#39;ve made by combining all the bags include a steam locomotive, a house, a TV, and a two-headed monster.</p>

<h2>Parts - 5/5</h2>

<p>I provided the <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?S=70825-1#T=I"">inventory for this set on BrickLink</a> and have spent dozens of hours with it, so I&#39;m intimately familiar with the parts.</p>

<p>This set consists almost entirely of basic bricks, plates and slopes plus a handful of SNOT elements in the following colors:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Red</li>
	<li>Dark red</li>
	<li>Orange</li>
	<li>Flame yellowish orange (bright light orange)</li>
	<li>Medium azure</li>
	<li>Dark azure</li>
	<li>Teal (dark turquoise)</li>
	<li>Magenta</li>
	<li>Dark purple</li>
	<li>Trans-dark pink</li>
	<li>Trans-purple</li>
</ul>

<p>It also contains a teal brick separator (the least expensive set to do so as of this writing), several unique printed bricks for the Queen&#39;s face,&nbsp;5 of the same crown element found in 70824 (1 in each bag to correspond to each face), 2 trans-clear 2x2 bricks, a black 1x8 plate and a black antenna.</p>

<p>I&#39;m personally extremely partial to more than half of the colors here, which is a big reason why I wanted this set as soon as it was revealed, and why I&#39;ve given a totally subjective rating of 5 for parts. If you don&#39;t build with these colors, this set won&#39;t be of any interest to you. If you do, then this set contains a decent number of basic bricks, plates and slopes in each of these colors. The part and color diversity here is significantly less than that of a regular LEGO Classic set, so this set does offer more in terms of quantity of each element. Additionally, if you like the color scheme of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/30340-1"">30340 Emmet&#39;s &#39;Piece&#39; Offering</a>, you&#39;ll like the colors here.</p>

<p>The vast majority of parts are fairly common, but the 12 purple 1x1x1 2/3 SNOT bricks and 6 dark red 1x2 SNOT bricks are brand new recolors exclusive to this set, as are the red and dark purple 1x2 studless curved bricks.</p>

<h2>Playability - 4/5</h2>

<p>Because there are no moving parts &mdash; with the exception of a single Technic pin-and-hole setup that makes one of the 15 models with instructions actually playable &mdash; the playability of this set consists of two aspects:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Building and rebuilding</li>
	<li>Imaginative play</li>
</ul>

<p>Sound familiar? That&#39;s because it&#39;s the exact same premise in regular LEGO Classic sets.</p>

<p>So there&#39;s not much to say here other than if you like playing with LEGO Classic sets or recreating scenes from The LEGO Movie 2 with the Queen, you&#39;ll like this; otherwise, you won&#39;t. Of course, there&#39;s nothing stopping you from building the Queen as one imposing monstrosity and displaying it in all its glory. It&#39;s still building, still part of the play experience.</p>

<h2>Value for money - 3/5</h2>

<p>I&#39;ll reiterate what I said at the beginning:</p>

<p>This is a glorified LEGO Classic set. The premium cost is due to the exclusive prints, the licensing and all the non-brick stuff that went into it, including the box, 5 instruction booklets with no download required, and a poster. They didn&#39;t just arbitrarily overprice this as a cash grab. Instead, the high price tag is a consequence of the production value that LEGO is then passing on to the consumer. (But if <em>that&#39;s</em> your definition of a cash grab, then that&#39;s fair and valid and I respect it.)</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t want to shoulder that extra cost, neither did I, which is why I got this at 25% off. Looking at the price in USD, the absolute most I&#39;d pay for it is $35 (12.5% off), not $40. The price-to-part ratio still isn&#39;t going to be anywhere near regular LEGO Classic sets, but this is not a regular LEGO Classic set.</p>

<p>And that&#39;s only if you&#39;re looking to experience this set holistically for what it is. If specific colors interest you, get sets primarily in those colors or BrickLink the parts you want in them. Don&#39;t get this set <em>for</em> bricks, plates and slopes in those colors. You&#39;re gonna get a ton of other material you don&#39;t need but nevertheless had to pay for.</p>

<p>There is literally nothing of resale value in this set either &mdash; not even the poster, the teal brick separator, the printed bricks, or the trans-clear 2x2 bricks &mdash; so don&#39;t even think about it. I have no experience with parting out sets for sale, so I can&#39;t comment on the overall part-out value of this set.</p>

<h2>Overall - 4/5</h2>

<p>Like every product ever made, 70825 Queen Watevra&#39;s Build Whatever Box! is not for everyone. There is no single LEGO set, or theme, with universal appeal. If this set is not for you, then it&#39;s not for you. Doesn&#39;t make it flat-out bad or &quot;not worth talking about&quot;. I personally have zero interest in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70841-1"">70841 Benny&#39;s Space Squad</a> and zero nostalgia for Classic Space, but I don&#39;t go around calling the set or the theme &quot;garbage&quot;.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you&#39;re a fan of the Queen and the values she embodies (literally), or if you and/or your kids just enjoy building and rebuilding wacky creations with equally wacky facial expressions using basic bricks and plates, get this set <em>at the right price </em>and you will have a good time. Maybe you won&#39;t get the dozens of hours I&#39;ve been getting and will continue to get out of it, but the excitement of building with LEGO bricks will definitely translate into enjoyment of this set.</p>
