The movie isn&#39;t out yet, so I&#39;m not sure if this is the correct story or not but it appears to be.</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGURES (Kind of)</strong></p>

<p><em>Unikitty&nbsp;</em>is the famous cat/unicorn mix that is always overwhelmed by happiness (until she turns into angry kitty). In this set she has two faces: Licking Kitty&nbsp;and Cute&nbsp;Kitty. She is built slightly different&nbsp;than before because she has a new 1x3 inverted tile with a hole that holds the head on securely. I like all of the random-looking colors on the feet, body&nbsp;and the tail.</p>

<p><em>Ice Cream Cone&nbsp;</em>is an ice cream cone with a face and a tie that is butler to Queen Watevera&nbsp;Wa&#39;Nabi. He is built using several rare pieces such as the pink dome and nougat arms. Ice Cream Cone is a really cute figure and he comes with a white mug to serve the Queen.</p>

<p><em>Chocolate bar&nbsp;</em>is another figure with a very literal name. He looks just like a real chocolate bar because of the brown gold ingot pieces and red wrapper. I like his eyes and feet and the bite out of him is a fun inclusion.</p>

<p><strong>Cupcake on a Plate</strong></p>

<p>This is a cupcake on a plate made with three pieces. Definitely&nbsp;nothing mind blowing here.</p>

<p><strong>Serving Cart</strong></p>

<p>This is a nice little build for Ice Cream Cone to push around. It comes with a teapot, a mug and a strawberry chocolate&nbsp;cake. The cart includes five&nbsp;1x2 round plates with holes which are very useful in other things.</p>

<p><strong>Final Opinion</strong></p>

<p>This set has no real minifigures&nbsp;and not very many pieces so it may not seem like good value for $10 USD, but it sure is worth it once you build it!! You get 3 adorable brick-built figures, two of which have new printed pieces. Plus you get lots of rare pieces for such a small set, so I definitely recommend&nbsp;this set, but it may not be for every one.</p>

<p>I hope this was helpful!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-02-06T13:10:38.763Z","Excellent Character Pack.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #70822 Unikitty&rsquo;s Sweetest Friends EVER!: </b>Welcome to The LEGO Movie 2&rsquo;s Unikitty set, and what a wonderfully cheap set it is. Not a whole lot to say concerning this set, this one is definitely something to get before it&rsquo;s gone and this review will explain why.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The small box with the purple logo overall looks great, the front shows the entire contents of the set very accurately and the back shows off the features. Not a whole lot to discuss here, hmm, sounds familiar. Decent package design, note that most sets at this price point have sold out by the time of writing this review.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The instructions come folded up in the box, so you may need to uncrease them to get the best function out of them. Fairly decent manual though.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set has a pitiful parts selection. Though what it does has is pretty impressive, you have the gold bar piece in brown to represent chocolate, a few printed elements for the Ice Cream Cone character and that&rsquo;s about it. Honestly for such a tiny set I did hope there might be more to see here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Chocolate Bar: This brick-built character features hinged feet and big googly eyes, plus it would appear someone has taken a bite out of him. Oh dear. This set features some really impressive characters, it&rsquo;s just such a shame about the extra model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ice Cream Cone: What a fun looking character, equally as amusing as the previous one. This figure introduces two new arm elements that can slot into cylinder with holes parts and work as regular Minifigure arms. The printed detailing on his sprinkle covered dome and cherry is very well done. And his torso print looks great.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Unikitty: Very fun version in this set, she comes with two expressions, a smiling happy one and an open mouth tongue sticking out eyes closed ready to lick up so sweets expression. Her build is identical to past Unikitty&rsquo;s, however it uses a few different ideas introduced with the Unikitty Theme.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build &amp; The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Aside from building the characters mentioned above we also have a small desert cart with an additional small desert build. This is quick and relatively easy and definitely minimal when it comes to builds.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The above mentioned items look fine, the Desert Cart includes a built cake, pink teapot and white coffee mug. The separate desert looks to be resting on a tray and is a creamy looking cupcake or something.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I like this set, but do wish LEGO had done more for it. This and the Good Morning Sparkle Babies sets have the same price and piece count and are basically LEGO Movie 2 Battle Packs. Which really begs the question, why didn&rsquo;t they try more with these sets? I would have loved to have seen better models to accompany the brick-built characters here and the Minifigures in the aforementioned other set. The models are weak, it would have been nice to have seen more, or at the least perhaps more Mini-Dolls included with the sets to mix up the Theme even more.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As far as this set is concerned I would still recommend it, but caution you all that you aren&rsquo;t getting a whole lot here. So try to get it on Clearance if you didn&rsquo;t buy it last year. Recommended.</p>
