"LettuceBrick","2018-12-25T21:56:46.933Z","Space Squad, Space Squad, Space Squad!!!","<p>Strap on your old-timey helmets and set phasers to nostalgia.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box features the space squad hanging out on what seems to be some sort of industrial surface on what appears to be the moon. There is a mysterious base of some sort in the background. The back features the names of each squad member. The instructions are standard.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The most obviously new parts create the minifigs. The pink torso is entirely new, the yellow one might have appeared before, and the white one has definitely been some sort of promotion somewhere in the last few years. The old style helmets have made a partial return in two old colors and one new color. Aside from Benny&#39;s helmet, they are unbroken.</p>

<p>Aside from the new minifigs, there is a printed 2x4 slope featuring the classic space logo. This has appeared before. There are two of the newer 2x2 with two studs plate/tile mashups in light gray.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The highlight, indeed, the very point of this set, is the new classic space minifigs. The white (Jenny) and yellow (Kenny) variants have obviously appeared before, but are hard to find in good condition. The pink one (Lenny) is entirely new, bringing to three the total of modern&nbsp; classic space torsos released in the past few years. Benny does not seem to have changed at all since his previous iteration. Each minifig has a classic accessory, including one of those totally not a gun things, albeit with a new variant of the handle part.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I do not have any old style figures on hand for comparison purposes.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is not at all complicated. It could even be used as a simple build-by-the-box challenge.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The set includes three small models guaranteed to knock you over with accumulated nostalgia. My favorite is the small spaceship/speeder, which is great fun to swoosh around. Unfortunately, it has two red lights instead of one each in red and green. The rover uses the new 2x2 parts to provide a seat that allows the squad members to be easily removed. The final build is a small robot in the style of the original classic space sets.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This is basically a Benny battle pack, with a few cool parts. Fans of Neo Classic Space will presumably rejoice, while older AFOLs may pick one up for the nostalgia value. One caveat is that the new crash helmet does not to my knowledge exist in pink, putting a bit of a damper on NCS minifig building. Without knowing how the squad figures into the movie, it is difficult to say how much kids will want the set, though a cheap way to get Benny may be enough of a draw. Personally, I plan on buying several more copies to round out the one I already have.</p>

This set just feels like Classic space Lego.&nbsp; &nbsp;Not to mention it introduced another color of space suit.</p>

"BeO","2018-12-27T22:37:18.6Z","A wonderful set for space fans","<p>I just assembled this lovely little set. Despite being small there&#39;s plenty of playability for&nbsp;kids. And AFOLs :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs were of course the main reason for me to get this set.&nbsp;The nostalgia factor is through the roof for someone who like me grew up with the first generation of Classic Space. But the vehicles are very well done here I think. The ship could easily have been an early 80s set by its own. Set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6803-1/Space-Patrol"">6803 Space Patrol</a> is the one that comes to my mind when I look at the ship here.</p>

<p>And the buggy is like a modern version of set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/886-1/Space-Buggy"">886 Space Buggy</a>. I&#39;ve already changed my new buggy by removing the two bricks at the back, moved the slope, seat and steering wheel back one stud, and then put an air tank in the front. And an antenna on the slope of course. But&nbsp;I kept the trans yellow plate in the front :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also replaced one trans red tile with a trans green one on the ship,&nbsp;like on the old ships (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/918-1/One-Man-Space-Ship"">918 One Man Space Ship</a> for example). *Edit: I must correct myself here. The LL9xx&nbsp;ships had the same colour on both sides. The trans red and trans green plates were placed on different parts of the ships, not like a navy ship where green is right and red is left side of the ship*&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new helmets are a nice mix of the originals and the &#39;newer&#39; versions that got the thicker chin strap. These new ones also have a much thicker chin strap, but they don&#39;t stick out from the helmet like the old thick straps. So these look pretty much like the original helmets, but won&#39;t break as easily (although I&#39;ve never managed to break one myself). Very well done, responsible Lego designer!</p>

<p>The robot is a copy of the ones that came with set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70816-1/Benny-s-Spaceship-Spaceship-SPACESHIP!"">70816 Benny&#39;s Spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP!</a> Nothing wrong with that, it makes sense Benny would use the same design. Or even the same robot? And the style is well in line with the older robots from for example set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6891-1/Gamma-V-Laser-Craft"">6891 Gamma V Laser Craft</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So to sum it up, if you played with Classic Space as a kid (well, it was only called Space back then) this set is a must have. The smiles per piece ratio is very high, just like the small sets from 40 years ago (the small buggy mentioned earlier, 886, 20 pieces! 5 of those are for the minifig!). I got three right away when I saw them in the store, will probably get a couple more later.&nbsp;Also got&nbsp;one of set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70821-1/Emmet-and-Benny-s-Build-and-Fix-Workshop!"">70821</a>, but that one is still unopened. I&#39;m having too much fun with this set right now :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to add both the vehicles and the minifigs to my LL10179 Classic Falcon.&nbsp;The buggy and the ship&nbsp;will fit perfectly as utility vehicles, and new space suits for the crew is always welcome!</p>

"Minifig290","2019-01-01T22:48:54.717Z","A good choice of set with some cons","<p>Happy New Year everyone, today ill be looking at my first 2019 set Benny Space Squad that retails for &pound;8.99 or $9.99 having 68 pieces giving a price per part of 13.2p or 14.7c. This set was released on Dec 26th 2018 and seems to be selling like hot cakes throughout the world with its 4 classic space figures and retro inspired builds for such a low price. Lets look at this non Star Wars space battle pack.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>There are four named space figures included in the set lets look at each character starting off with Benny.</p>

<p>Benny has the 2014 blue cracked helmet piece return with a new double sided face with one face showing a happy chipper mouth and bold dot eyes and his second face has a worried expression with his eyelids covering part of his eyes in worry. Benny&#39;s oxygen tank is the same used in the sets back in the day and a torso print that is identical to the 2014 print used on Benny in the first LEGO Movie with his space logo chipping. Finally he has plain unprinted blue legs.</p>

<p>The reason benny has a cracked helmet is because back in the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s the piece would commonly crack but with the next three minifigures they are moulded stronger to prevent a rehash of the cracking.</p>

<p>Next there is a exclusive pink astronaut called Lenny, he has the same hat, oxygen tank and legs that Benny uses but in pink. Lenny&#39;s head is the classic smile face that the modular&#39;s had up till 2018, and his torso is the space logo but it is in pristine condition with no chipping.</p>

<p>Also included is a white astronaut named Jenny and a yellow astronaut named Kenny that are identical to Lenny but Jenny&#39;s torso, legs, hat and tank are white and Kenny&#39;s are yellow.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>To go along with the four space buddies there are a few tools, they include a black metal detector, wrench and radio also a blaster built using a trans green cylinder and gray holder piece.</p>

<p>Finally there&#39;s a brick built robot that is really cute. The robot has a antenna, two gray arms and a small gray dish piece for the robot s base. The bots face is created using a trans yellow and blue cheese slope piece.</p>

<p><strong>Builds</strong></p>

<p>Now the builds, there are two small polybag sized vehicles. Firstly there&#39;s a small spce glider build that has the most interesting non minifigure piece a printed blue 2x4 slope with a space logo printed. Any of the figures can sit in the blue seat and control the ship using the blue steering wheel. At the back of the seat is a droid head used as a engine and a antenna is attached with a clip piece on the side of the seat. On each sides of the seat is a 1x1 trans red tile and at the back under the chair is a 1x2 trans red plate for a brake light.</p>

<p>The next build is a little space buggy, this build is extremely simple using very few parts. The steering wheel is the same used on the glider but in gray. two figures can sit in on the buggy on 2 2x2 half tile and half plate piece in light gray. Under the steering wheel there is a 1x2 trans yellow plate for a head light. At the back of the buggy there are two clips to hold two of the accessories. To drive the buggy around there are four small common wheel pieces.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is a bloody brilliant set that mostly AFOL&#39;s are rushing to get as it takes them back to their childhoods playing with classic space sets with the iconic space minifigures. As a TFOL i&#39;m not as excited to get this set but I love the builds as they are very cute, but like the AFOL&#39;s i love the figures as the pink astronaut is great looking and the yellow and white astronaut are iconic to the LEGO company. I love lego for releasing Benny in a small cheap set along with other space figures.</p>

<p>I would recommend this set to most AFOL&#39;s and late TFOL&#39;s but i would not recommend this set to many children because the play factor is fairly bleak but on the other hand the price is quite high to me as a price per part of 13p/14c is too high dispute the minifigures and cute robot.</p>

<p><strong>Pros - </strong>Great iconic well made minifigures, cheap way to get a normal Benny, well built vehicles, robot is a cute addition, great inclusion of parts such as metal detector printed parts and minifigure parts.</p>

<p><strong>Cons - </strong>Price Per Part is very disappointing but is just about bearable for me, a cheap set doesn&#39;t quite speak to younger fans.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2018-12-29T06:54:40.11Z","Classic Space is Back... Almost","<p>As a child of the 80&rsquo;s I loved playing with all my Space Legos, in fact I still have all of them today. So of course I had to buy this set if for no other reason to get the pink astronaut (who strangely isn&rsquo;t the girl). So let&rsquo;s get to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigures</b></p>

<p>This is probably the reason why you are buying the set, and maybe just for the pink one. The minifigures are true to the originals with a slight exception. The helmets have a thicker chin strap and the mold was made differently creating a small dimple at the top. Benny of course is the only one that doesn&rsquo;t conform. His head is reversible and features two impossibly cute cartoonish expressions, his helmet pretend cracked, and the logo on his suit looks worn off (I never had these problems with my astronauts).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The robot is unlike classic space&nbsp;robots, definitely a much more modern streamlined look. It is not blocky like the originals.&nbsp;It also includes 1x1 sloped tiles (one in transparent yellow + an extra). It is also blue and gray as opposed to black and gray like the originals. While it may not fit in well with the other robots, it still looks very nice and I do like it. Besides, the old ones can easily be built from spare parts so why not do something different. I do really like how his body is built entirely from an old video camera brick.</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>parts</b></p>

<p>The parts are slightly disappointing as they are mostly new and readily available. The exceptions being the printed roof tile and the old school seat. You also get a transparent yellow 1x2 tile and blue and black antennas (2 of them, it includes an extra).</p>

<p>There are plenty of parts that are used that were not available in the 80&rsquo;s. As a result, it allows for sturdier builds with sleeker more streamlined looks. Even the angled plates are readily available in Star Wars sets, and not the old school ones with the cut out corners.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m definitely a bit disappointed here, only one printed brick, three&nbsp;transparent yellows, and one seat. The potential for awesome bricks was so high with this set, but at least we got the minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>Build</b></p>

<p>Look at the picture, you know it will be easy. It says 5+, but that&rsquo;s only because it has a few 1x1 bricks. Quite honestly, this is easier than any Lego Juniors set. The older small sets would at least offer some moving parts and primitive SNOT techniques. But I guess you aren&rsquo;t buying this for the build anyways. But if you are giving this to your kid, expect them to be a little bored with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>Vehicles</b>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The space buggy is very reminiscent of the ones that would fit into the old larger ships. In fact it could be swapped into one of the ships no problem.&nbsp; It is basically a remake of 886, which was an incredibly basic set from 1979 and one you could piece together on bricklink for probably less than $1.&nbsp;The main difference is that it seats 2 minifigures&nbsp;and is very sleek. The old buggies always looked very rigid and seemed to have their mechanics exposed. Plus the bottom of this buggy is made up entirely of new parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The spaceship doesn&rsquo;t really mesh too well with the older smaller ships, but it is also a remake.&nbsp; It is very similar to 885, another set from 1979 that is very simple and can pieced together on bricklink&nbsp;for less than $2.&nbsp;Again it is very sleek and streamlined, but it has added blue to the color mix (885 was all gray) and is considerably smaller. It is also way too simple, looks like it could have come out of a Star Wars advent calendar set. It simply lacks the details of the older ships. Some megaphones on either side of the seat would have made a world of difference. And the R2 unit head in the back just looks bad, at least use a transparent red cone instead.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;m very disappointed, this could have been so much better. Even if they didn&rsquo;t want to recreate more discontinued bricks, simply a better brick selection would have given us slightly more complex builds and vehicles that looked truer to the 80&rsquo;s. At the end of the day however, I have to give the set 5 stars, purely on the strength of the minifigures. Battle packs I believe are always worth the money for this reason, but I also always love the vehicles in Star Wars battle packs which have more parts and are better looking. These vehicles leave a lot to be desired.</p>

<p>Of course, if you aren&rsquo;t a Classic Space fan then don&rsquo;t even bother with this set, you probably won&rsquo;t be all that excited by the minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

"Mr__Thrawn","2019-01-02T19:01:40.167Z","A Perfect Love Letter to Classic Space","<p>First off, I&#39;m just going to say that I love classic space. Therefore, it is likely that&nbsp;this review will be a bit biased in some ways.</p>

<p>I found this set at a Barnes &amp; Noble store on 12.26.2018, release day. This is only the second time I&#39;ve bought a set on release day, which should tell you how excited I was. Now, on to the review.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>The set comes in a small square box, typical of LEGO city starter sets. The front shows all the Squad hovering about on a moon somewhere, and the back shows pictures of the builds and a figure line-up, which shows a shocked Benny who&#39;s just pulled the arm off a robot. This is particularly funny to those of us that remember the problems with said mold in 21109 Exo Suit. The bags are un-numbered, and the instruction booklet came folded in half.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>To most, the build for this set is boring and basic. However, to Space fans, it feels like an authentic classic space experience. Just simple plate stacking.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are three entirely new elements, 12 classic (or new versions of classic) elements, and one printed (non minifig) element. The new elements are the helmet mold in dark pink, yellow, and white. The classic parts are the space seat, accessories, steering wheels, airtanks, and robot arms. The print is on the slope.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Let&#39;s face it- this set is a figure pack, and what makes or breaks a figure pack is the figures. I am pleased to say that the Space Squad themselves make the set in a big way. The two &quot;original&quot; spacemen are perfect reprints, and Lenny is a great addition to the rainbow. Benny is also a charming homage in himself, representing the well-loved spacemen that all AFOLs have somewhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>Normally, the builds in a set like this one are simplistic and feel like an excuse to justify the price. That is not the case here. The two builds are simple, yes, but they are also perfect, logical evolutions of the classic models. They use new parts when it is necessary or sensible, but keep enough of that classic flavor to feel authentic.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is truly a classic space set&nbsp;released in 2019. It&#39;s charming in its simplicity, and the minifigures are a heavy dose of nostalgia. I think Graham at Brick Fanatics put it best- &quot;It&#39;s not a question of whether to buy it, but how many copies to buy.&quot;</p>

<p>When I opened the plastic and assembled the spacemen, it really was a great nostalgic feeling. The minifig&nbsp;plastic was fresh, pristine and sturdy, and it really felt like i was a kid again, playing with the classic space sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pink astronaut is really delightful and a welcome addition. I love the accessories like the metal detector esque part. Again, flashbacks to the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The vehicle builds are simple and fun. I hope LEGO will revive the classic space sets so fans can build new space adventures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cmon LEGO make more colorful astronauts. I want the black and red ones back! Cheers</p>

"Golem25","2019-01-10T12:46:01.187Z","We should all want more sets like this one","<h3><strong>Introduction</strong></h3>

<p>Hi, it&#39;s me again - your friendly neighbourhood cynic reviewer who really doesn&#39;t buy LEGO anymore due to the exploitative pricing of sets in Europe. After a slew of well appreciated reviews a few months ago, I&#39;ve laid my hands on a set I was incredibly excited about and I am rather pleased to be sharing my thoughts about it with you today. Despite the year being but two weeks old, I feel <strong>70841 Benny&#39;s Space Squad</strong> is already a big contender for SOTY (Set of The Year) overall, and pretty much a lock for that title within its pricing range. Putting such musings aside, let us just dive right in as we have plenty to discuss!</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3><strong>Packaging</strong></h3>

<p>The set comes in a fairly small box, which took a while to catch my eye despite looking for it on my local store&#39;s shelves.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.postimg.cc/rmCPk2Hs/20981a78-8fa5-4502-bd79-ea14943c68d4.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The top of the front has a thick slice of LEGO Movie 2 branding, with its star-dotted background, Emmet, and Lucy being shared across most sets in the theme. Perhaps it&#39;s an obscure reference, but it puts me in mind of <a href=""https://club25football.wordpress.com/2018/12/02/rf-hong-kong-%e5%af%8c%e5%8a%9brf-2018-2019-away-shirt/"">this football shirt</a> from Hong Kong. The set features two builds, four Minifigures, and one robot that you could classify as either (Brickset has it listed as a Minifig, I see it as a build more than anything).</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.postimg.cc/rFSCZNvy/950b1b80-ac31-4429-aad6-4d1b92627fb5.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Benny stars on the top of the box as the 1:1 scale reference, and is equally well-represented on the back as pilot/astronaut of the largest build. A wonderful line-up of the figures, introducing them and their names, is the more interesting part of this side, however. On bigger boxes you&#39;d see this &#39;mugshot gallery&#39; on the front, but given space (hah!) constraints it&#39;s no surprise to see it on the reverse of the box in this case.</p>

<p>There are no play features to speak of in this set, so instead we are treated to classic scenes of the Minifigures &#39;using&#39; the builds. Despite my growing up in the 90&#39;s rather than the late 70&#39;s or 80&#39;s, this style of box art is all too familiar to me, and I can&#39;t help but smile. Props to the LEGO Company for managing to recognize the relevance of AFOLs, no matter how small this group might be compared to kids, and catering to them like this whilst still keeping the likes and wants of kids in mind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Build &amp; Parts</strong></h3>

<p>Let&#39;s be honest here; there&#39;s not much building involved with a set that only has 68 listed pieces, with 20 of those dedicated to the Minifigures alone! However, LEGO in recent years has often been about quality rather than quantity, and it is a fact that you don&#39;t need a lot of pieces to have a satisfying building experience.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.postimg.cc/nLM3WQ4d/d851a4be-8205-4d09-9497-2052b4364b2b.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Case in point, laying out all the pieces for Benny and his friends. You don&#39;t need to suffer from OCD or an oddly strong need to neatly arrange LEGO parts to absolutely love this scene; four Minifigures, Classic-inspired Minifigures even, in familiar and new colours, ready to be assembled. I don&#39;t know about other owners of this set, but snapping together these Classic Spacemen (and Woman) was a lot more fun and definitely more satisfying than building yet another grey box-esque vehicle from the Star Wars line (especially common since Di$ney took over the franchise).</p>

<p>Benny should be familiar to most all at this point; there have been plenty of opportunities to get him in the past, although I believe 70841 to be the cheapest and most reliable way to get him to date, being a boxed retail set and all (his Universe fun pack was 15 bucks before discounts). His torso remains scratched up and his helmet &#39;broken&#39;.</p>

<p>His friends, however, are new for TLM2; we have Kenny, Jenny, and Lenny, from left to right. All three of these figures have a pristine Classic Space logo, a modern mould of the Classic Space helmet, and come with the classic oxygen tank (as does Benny). All three of them have also been given names, although I am 99 percent sure this will stop exactly no one from army building these fellas (interestingly, I grabbed the final copy my store had of this set, the others having been sold already. The other TLM2 sets all had plenty of copies left). I expect the pink astronaut to be the most popular out of the four, given that it is a brand new colour for this style of figure, and only the second new colour in modern days (green being the first in the Exo-Suit Ideas set).</p>

<p>One thing I do wonder about is why TLC decided to give the white astronaut a female name, with the pink astronaut getting a male name. Given the amount of people involved with designing and green lighting a LEGO set (or any retail product really), this must have been a concious decision, for which the reason eludes me. Pink remains a firmly feminine colour despite the best efforts of subversive cultural movements, and it just seems so unnecessary to swap names around like this. Thankfully, children will either not care or fully ignore this, as they should, but it does make me furrow my brow as to why TLC decided to name the characters in this way.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.postimg.cc/7YdhzFBf/4cf51e92-16c5-4425-bc59-38f3e82ec600.jpg"" /></p>

<p>The three builds included in the set feature a slew of classic pieces, the same ones you&#39;d have seen in the revered Classic Space line, along with a few new ones; the most interesting pieces of both groups I&#39;ve laid out in the picture above. Included are the accessories for the Minifigures, as well as the bulk of the parts for their vehicles and robot helper.</p>

<p>The usage of modern pieces (such as the dome that will be used as exhaust for the &#39;flyer&#39;) feels a little egregious and out of place to me in this set, but purely from a personal perspective; I understand and accept their conclusion as some classic pieces are no longer produced. In fact, it seems like the designer has laboured to use as many classic bricks as possible, using the modern ones only when absolutely necessary. This design choice, which is purely in the interest of the final product being as good as it can be, should be appreciated.</p>

<p>A special shoutout to the 4 by 2 slope piece with the PRINTED Classic Space logo; it is lovely, a callback to the days of yore without stickers, and just another highlight of this set. It is wholly intact and pristine, unlike Benny&#39;s torso print, and thus perhaps a little bit more useful.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures &amp; Vehicles</strong></h3>

<p>I do love Benny, I really do, but given how familiar we are with him already and the closer look at his dual-sided head the previous pictures have given you, I shall omit him from further consideration for the sake of brevity.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.postimg.cc/NMGYrDmN/49245df0-6126-4044-8fd4-0706c13631bc.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Up first is Jenny, who wields a reimagined version of the Classic Space &#39;blaster&#39; in what to me is the first time where I&#39;ve gotten to see this piece up close; it doesn&#39;t hold a candle to the original, but it does seem more sturdy and durable, so fair play to LEGO for this.</p>

<p>Jenny, all in white, is accompanied by an as-of-yet unnamed robot; it has been listed by Brickset as Classic Space Droid - Light Bluish Gray and Blue with Trans-Yellow Eye. Consisting of eight smallish pieces, it is a simple enough build with arms that can be reasonably easily detached (as show by Benny on the back of the box). Plenty of play potential with this fella then, but calling it a Minifigure remains a bit of a stretch to me. Really the only part of this robot/droid that sticks out as being &#39;unclassic&#39; would be the use of cheese slopes to form the front of its torso. Despite these pieces being very common place nowadays, they have only been introduced halfway through the 00&#39;s. Crazy to think we once had to do without them for detailing and greebling, right?</p>

<p>As per Jens Nygaard Knudsen, the creator of the Classic Space theme, the white spacemen (woman in this case) represented explorers. The official art of the set lists Jenny as wielding the wrench, but the instructions have you build her with the &#39;blaster&#39; - perhaps this is actually meant to be a sensor of sorts then, as it ties into the original designation of her colour.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.postimg.cc/SQdRVZrf/0f39c26b-c750-40a3-82df-e987fb877893.jpg"" style=""width: 1067px; height: 800px;"" /></p>

<p>Up next we have Kenny, who is draped in full yellow. Unlike Jenny in white, which was the first colour of Classic spacemen introduced alongside red, the yellow spacemen were introduced in 1979, a year after the theme was launched. According to the original creator, the yellow-clad Minifigures were meant to be scientists.</p>

<p>It is then perhaps no surprise to find Kenny wielding an apparatus that allows him to scan the soil; this is a new mould based on a classic piece, which had its most prolific use (in my eyes) in the Exploriens theme. Next to Kenny, we find the little surface rover that is the second biggest build in the set; using small tires and smooth plates on the bottom to ease traversing uneven surfaces, this little thing is easy to &#39;drive&#39; around, and seats two figures with space on the back to clip their accessories on to. A yellow headlight is positioned beneath the steering wheel, whilst two 2x2 plates with two studs are used as seats; this allows figures to be more easily removed thanks to a halving of clutch power compared to a 2x2 with four studs.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.postimg.cc/xTC0T9SW/6992e604-1b79-4721-8b7a-1641057551cd.jpg"" /></p>

<p>Finally, we have Lenny, who comes clad in a fantastic pink! A brand new colour for Classic spacemen, and much easier to get than the ridiculously expensive green figures from the Ideas set. Although Lenny drives the rover in the official art, he is given a wrench to hold in the instructions. We can only guess as to what the pink spacemen are in terms of job designation, although given Lenny&#39;s wrench and his propensity for driving, I would suggest they are either mechanics or drivers (red spacemen are designated as pilots, so this would allow pink and red to coexist).</p>

<p>The &#39;flyer&#39; is called a spaceship in the official description of the set, although I cannot see this as more than a low altitude single seater for short distance traversal. It features the fantastic printed brick on the front, with a transparent plate hidden beneath the engine to simulate a method of propulsion. The upward-pointing rod on the starboard side can be rotated just over ninety degrees to the front, so you could potentially imagine it as being a weapon of sorts. The same goes for the two prongs on the front. Given that Kenny the scientist pilots it in the official art, we can presume it to be a sensor, although if one were to place Benny, being a blue spaceman (blue being soldiers/security forces), in the pilot seat you would have more cause for concern. Although a single seater, you could have some fun by having a second Minifigure hold onto the sensor array.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Concluding Thoughts</strong></h3>

<p>With all physical elements of the set having been covered, the concluding part of my reviews is often where things completely fall apart in terms of rating. After all, with the pricing of LEGO these days (or well, these past decades), sets representing a good deal are often few and far inbetween. Maybe it&#39;s because I just came off the back of the Unikitty! and Harry Potter blindbags, but the hobby seems more expensive than ever, especially in Europe.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://i.postimg.cc/857n7XtB/d464e902-6a36-4202-beca-7ec1f5a73f30.jpg"" /></p>

<p>However, every once in a while, life seems to throw you a bone - a lucky break perhaps. In this set&#39;s case, LEGO seems to be giving us a present; a classically styled set with FOUR CLASSIC SPACEMEN priced at 10 Euros/10 USD/8 or so GBP.</p>

<p>That is downright fantastic. It&#39;s amazing. It&#39;s a gift horse you should not look in mouth. It is, across the past years, the single closest LEGO seems to have come to truly representing the wishes of its adult customers whilst still providing an amazing set for its current young audience, all the whilst providing them with amazing value for money. Yes, the price to part ratio is horrendous, but when you get four Minifigures for this price, you sit down and shut up because that alone makes this set close to being worth its pricetag. The three builds (no, you shan&#39;t convince me that robot counts as a figure) are simply added value, and represent an amazing play experience with lots of potential for kids. You can get your child this set and have them play with it endlessly. Period.</p>

<p>So really, for once, I&#39;d like to thank LEGO. This set is amazing, the pricepoint is amazing, and everyone involved with it from conception to realization to marketing should be proud of themselves. If you can get one set this year, you should seriously consider 70841 as being that pick. Not only because it is an amazing product, but because this set selling out everywhere will send a strong message to LEGO; we want more of this.</p>

<p>That, then, is ultimately my final thought on the matter; I want more sets like this.</p>

"omnius","2022-02-16T14:26:11.183Z","A love letter to a classic line","<p>When The Lego Movie 2 sets were first unveiled, this set drew much excitement from fans of Classic Space. Just as the first movie&#39;s #70816 &#39;Benny&#39;s Spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP!&#39; was a homage to the classic ships of the 1970s/80s, this is a fitting update of the smaller sets.</p>

<p>The obvious draw is the set of four minifigures, all Classic Space astronauts. You get:</p>

<p>Benny: Blue suit</p>

<p>Kenny: Yellow suit</p>

<p>Lenny: Pink suit</p>

<p>Jenny: White suit</p>

<p>The original visor-less helmet has been reintroduced (with new tooling), a welcome change to the previous Class Space homages which used the later helmet. Benny, of course, has his broken chinstrap and scratched-off logo and a double-sided head. The other three have the long-running plain smiling face. I can&#39;t praise the minifigures enough - Kenny &amp; Jenny are almost indistinguishable from their Classic Space ancestors, and a pink spacesuit is a welcome addition! They also include a selection of tools including a radio, wrench and metal detector.</p>

<p>The two vehicles are quick and simple builds, reminiscent of the pocket money-priced vehicles of the 1980s. One is an open shuttle/speeder-type vehicle with more than a few nods to #6803&nbsp;Space Patrol. The second is a rover buggy that can seat two minifigures. Lastly, the set is rounded out by a small robot that harks back to the robots of Classic Space, along with the two included with #70816.</p>

<p>Lastly, I wish I could rate this set higher than a 5 for Value For Money. At &pound;8.99 / $9.99 / 9.99&euro; this is an absolute steal. If you want an incredible retro-style set at a great price, then look no further!</p>

"Faefrost","2019-01-05T06:08:10.367Z","This might be the Best Set of the Year already","<p>I am going to forego the long detailed categorized analysis of this set, ie packaging, parts, etc. Simply because it is a small minifig&nbsp;centric impulse set. It&#39;s essentially the most wonderous thing ever...</p>

<p>A CLASSIC SPACE BATTLEPACK!!!!!</p>

<p>I could probably stop the review there and it would be enough. But I have to say it again. A CLASSIC SPACE BATTLE PACK!!! After over 3 decades of almost no love, save Benny, we have a 4 pack of Classic Space figures. Including a new color. Pink. (Lenny clearly sucks at doing Laundry!)&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set is a fairly small 68 pieces. Which seems a little pricey with it&#39;s $9.99 price tag. But it gives you Four delightful Classic Spacemen. Blue Benny with his broken helmet. Yellow Kenny, White Jenny and Pink Lenny. All save Benny have the classic Lego smiley face. And all save Benny have a new redone classic helmet. It&#39;s not the standard racing/late model space helmet. These new ones are a straighter almost cylindrical profiile&nbsp;in line with the originals. Just with a thicker more sturdy chin strap (save Benny&#39;s which in keeping with his character comes pre broken). All 4 torso&#39;s have the classic Space Logo printed on them. Benny&#39;s is the worn weathered look of an old minifig. Everyone elses&nbsp;are factory new with crisp gold white and red. You haven&#39;t seen the logo look this good in years. Each figure comes with matching colored classic air tanks. So we get those in a new color, Pink.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The builds are minimal, but oh so pleasing. There is a small grey&nbsp;buggy that evokes memories of the one carried by LL 928 the Galaxy Explorer or set 886 Space Buggy. The Buggy is tiny, but can carry two spacemen. While not classic grey&nbsp;it is a pleasing combo or light and dark bley&nbsp;with a trans yellow front light. Sadly the wheel rims are light bley&nbsp;instead of old school red. But you can&#39;t have everything.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Next up is the small 1 man flyer. It&#39;s shaped rather like classic set 885 Space Scooter, but is colored more like the blue and grey&nbsp;larger ships. It has a nice 2x4 blue slope on the front with a printed Classic Space Logo. Rather nicely ALL parts are printed in this small set. There are no stickers. The flyer is well evocative of numerous classic space designs. There is no questioning its lineage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final build is a small Classic Space style brick built robot. Not too unlike the ones found in Benny&#39;s spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP. Among other things he uses a pair of classic robot arms in light bley.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this is a must have set. Or more likely an Army Builder set for Classic Space Fans. This seems to be the most rapidly selling out set of TLM2 sets. It&#39;s a wonderful little set that evokes&nbsp;the past perfectly and brings it forward to a new generation. Not quite on the scale as TLM&#39;s SSS but it gives us the figures we have so longed for.&nbsp;</p>
",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Hashem1983","2019-03-23T10:22:31.857Z","A Blast From The Past!!!!!","<p>First of all, I finally got Benny, I never had the chance to get him from the first series and not even I was able to get the Double Decker Couch set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For its small size its quite adequate especially when you get in total 4 classic figures from the space theme but of course Benny is a bit different.</p>

<p><strong>Box &amp; Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>The size of the box is small for the size of the set itself. The artwork on the front has the Lego Movie 2 label showing all of the set itself, I liked the upside down figure that shows he&#39;s quite in action and Benny on the front with that big beautiful smile and happiness on his face. However&nbsp;&nbsp;its the back of the box that I liked, of course in the past we had the alternate builds unlike today which shows the features of the set, but in here I felt that the artist tried to capture some of the original poses of the figures like it was back in the 1980&#39;s, however the most important part is Benny in his mini spaceship.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts and Building Experience:</strong></p>

<p>For the parts and building experience it&#39;s quite decent, and the set itself is dedicated to the figures so there&#39;s not much of a great build but for the playability and even for display purposes its magnificent. Lego tried to capture some of the classic builds like the scooter and the mini jet and you get a decent robot with it, so basically it won&#39;t take 5 minutes of your time to build.</p>

<p>As for the parts the newer to my collection of parts are the 2X4 slope piece and the 2x2 plate with 2 studs only plus an accessory I never had.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Figures:</strong></p>

<p>They are 4 in total, again, its Benny that is the unique one, as all of them comes in solid color, Pink, Yellow, White and Blue for Benny, with the Space logo on the front of the torso. Of course they all have the oxygen pack and the classic helmet. In Benny the logo is made to look faded away from time, the helmet has the crack effect and regarding to that when I opened the box I actually felt that it was actually&nbsp;cracked not a mold effect, and he is the one with the double printed face, the happy one and the sad one, as for the rest they all have the classic face that we like so much, 2 dots and a smile.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Looks and Overall:</strong></p>

<p>I want to confess, when I was young, I wasn&#39;t much of a fan of the classic space theme in general, but when I saw the first movie it was Benny who made me love it and I only have one set from that time which is <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6845-1/Cosmic-Charger"">6845 Cosmic Charger</a>, you can read my review regarding to this set, anyway, it&#39;s not everyday Lego presents you something from the classic themes or parts, but from what I saw on Brickset when the sets were announced this is the most wanted set because it&#39;s a classic in a modern time that most of the adults will love and respect.</p>

<p>I just added few tiny things, since you get an extra holder I placed it to the left side of the jet seat for the accessory, and since I have extra spare visors from other sets, I placed them on the figures helmets and it did fit well.</p>

<p>Just remember once thing: Do not touch Benny when he&#39;s space-shipping!!</p>

And I can see why, as fans can attest it is rare to receive such a wonderfully nostalgic set aimed squarely at them.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: This tiny box holds a lot of fun for fans of Classic Space. It also looks great, showing off the set in all its glory and matches the style of The LEGO Movie 2 Theme quite nicely.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: A small manual folded in half. Not much to say here, it&rsquo;s a serviceable manual with easy to follow steps. There was nothing that stood out to me as difficult to follow.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set features several elements in line with Classic Space. You have the printed element with the Space logo, the standard grey and blue coloured bricks and some accessories we haven&rsquo;t seen in most other sets lately. It&rsquo;s a love letter to the era of LEGO Space circa 1970s.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Benny: Back from The LEGO Movie Benny is the same Minifigure we&rsquo;ve seen since the original film Theme launched around 2014. He has no accessories.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Jenny: The Classic White Spacewoman, Jenny is pristine and looks almost identical to the original Minifigures found in the 1970&rsquo;s. Simple printing and simple details for the character, she carries the Classic Space Blaster element, which can be a blaster or a space flashlight.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kenny: Classic Yellow Spaceman steps out of the past and into the current LEGO world. The original metal detector/mine sweeper piece is included for an accessory and Kenny uses it to find hidden parts to help rebuild the robot, or repair the ship. Or survey whatever planet they might be on.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Lenny: The not-so-Classic Pink Spaceman is a treat to behold, given a wrench as an accessory the character features the same simple printing found on all Classic Spacemen. Only this is a new colour, never before seen.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build &amp; The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Building in this set is pretty simple, you make a little lunar rover type vehicle and a small spaceship very in-keeping with Classic Space models. Even the little buildable robot is a throwback to the simple and quirky designs of LEGO Space.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The finished models are great fun to play with too, for a battle pack these models are pretty solid. You can seat three of the included Minifigures across the two models, leaving one character and the robot to walk alongside. There isn&rsquo;t a whole lot to discuss honestly, this sets models are just great. They may seem a bit plain and simplistic compared to the more detailed models found elsewhere, but that&rsquo;s the charm of it, you can use this set to expand with other models and build something truly remarkable.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is based on a brief scene in the movie and as such has no real connection to the main plot, but it makes for a fun little set to collect and amass an army of Classic Space Minifigures and models to bulk out the original era sets you may have, or Benny&rsquo;s Spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP! From the first LEGO Movie Theme if you were lucky enough to get one before they vanished.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I would strongly recommend getting multiples of this set and it is the perfect price for such an endeavour. Even if you don&rsquo;t care much for the Theme, anybody who is a fan of Classic Space will want to pick this set up. Highly Recommended.</p>

I will avoid the temptation of diving into the details since this set has already been thoroughly reviewed by many. I will just add my personal observations...</p>

<p>The scale of the set and the choice of mini-models, parts, and colours choice is just sweet. As a long time AFOL who grew up with the classic space theme of the 80s I can&#39;t help but love this tribute to classic space. I very much enjoyed the brisk yet fun build that brings together the classic shapes of the iconic space vehicles of the era in no time at all leveraging modern parts. The style of the vehicles and robot are right on. The attention to details is amazing, including the room left for the astronaut&#39;s air bottles to allow them to sit comfortably. It&#39;s curious that LEGO has chosen to leave the genders of the characters watevra wa&#39;nabi.</p>

<p>My 2y/o daughter loves buzzing the spaceship and moon rover which are perfect size for her little hands. She also seems to really like removing and then putting back the helmets of the crew (under close supervision, of course). Who ever said classic space is fun for AFOLs only?</p>

<p>Non-pretentious, full of charm, generation transcending - Benny&#39;s Space Squad is the perfect gift set for LEGO fans of all ages. I highly recommend it.</p>

"8BrickMario","2022-08-21T05:19:39.27Z","A small, very very sweat treat. SPACE SQUAD!!!","<p>This set is almost a gift. It&#39;s certainly generous. If we thought Benny was fanservice before, this outdoes him&nbsp;by providing&nbsp;the first fully-authentic Classic Space revival, all serving as a cheap minifigure pack that resurrects and injects some novelty into the classics. It&#39;s actually something of a milestone set, and after getting and loving the 2022 Galaxy Explorer, it was imperative for me to track down this set as a supplement. I&#39;m very glad I was able to.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures are obviously the main draw, but I&#39;ll start with the least novel--Benny. I&#39;d never gotten a set with Benny in it before, which was a shame, and it&#39;s great to see him in a small offering&nbsp;with his comrades. Benny&#39;s design is based on an aged 1980s minifigure, with the same shine-less classic minifig eyes as Emmet and some unique touches. For one, his Classic Space helmet has fractured at the chin. This was a common phenomenon with the old figures that&#39;s represented in the Benny toys with a new helmet piece that realistically&nbsp;mimics the break with a solid sculpt that runs no risk of breaking. Benny&#39;s Classic Space torso logo is also made to look like scuffed and worn-away printing to convey his age. This Benny has two faces with his exuberant mouth, one in a shocked frown and the other in a gleeful smile.&nbsp;Benny&#39;s had versions with the classic LEGO smiley on one side of his head, but swapping out a classic smiley is still an easy option.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other figures are where the &quot;milestone&quot; element comes in, because these guys serve not as nostalgic jokes, but as outright pristine reproduced figures-- plus a new entry to the older lineup. The astronauts, Lenny, Jenny, and Kenny, introduce a new helmet that faithfully recreates the Classic Space helmet mold in unbroken form, and it makes all the difference. Previous reprint Classic astronauts&nbsp;used the more modern and sleek motorcycle helmet piece for headgear, and its different shaping brings down the effect.&nbsp;With the more faithful helmet remake introduced here, these guys have the real deal and it makes them look great and hardly distinguishable from the originals. Kenny and Jenny use two existing Classic Space suit colors, with yellow&nbsp;and white&nbsp;being among the most common in those sets, along with red. Benny represents the less-common blue astronauts, and Lenny, rather than going for the classic red, introduces an entirely new Classic Space suit color with a pink design! I love seeing Classic Space branching into new outfit colors, and while the pink color outright&nbsp;wasn&#39;t in the eighties LEGO palette, its vibrant cheer is perfectly in tone with the other suits. That repro helmet really changed the game, and it&#39;s stuck around for the introduction of the orange astronaut in one of the books&nbsp;and the Galaxy Explorer&nbsp;(though the latter set would have surely introduced the remade helmet if this one hadn&#39;t).&nbsp;It makes me wish the three&nbsp;Classic Space torsos we saw in other new colors (green in the Ideas Exo-Suit,&nbsp;grey in the Rocket Boy CMF, and purple in the Alien Creature CMF) could be paired with the repro helmet in those colors so full green and grey and purple&nbsp;&quot;new Classic&quot; Space astronauts could be properly constructed to match Lenny and the orange one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>History lesson over. These Classic Space designs&nbsp;haven&#39;t lost a bit of charm since they were the newest thing, and to get proper reproductions of two classic suit colors and a new one to boot is such a delight for anyone who loves their old LEGO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fun doesn&#39;t stop with the minifigures. There are some nice pieces and mini-builds to be had as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I really liked the accessories, and was delighted to get a metal detector, which 1. I&#39;ve never had in my LEGO collection. 2.&nbsp;screams Classic Space and 3. was something I really wished was in the Galaxy Explorer. There&#39;s also a walkie-talkie, a simple retro-esque space gun, and a wrench.</p>

<p>One of the small assemblies is a little robot built on a camera stood on a dish. It has the old robot arm pieces, though its visor-only &quot;face&quot; gives it a more modern edge than I&#39;m used to in Classic Space.</p>

<p>The next assembly is a small space rover with a tiered seating system that allows two astronauts to ride on it. Clips on the back let the wrench and walkie-talkie be stored easily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final assembly is a small jet evoking the wedge shape and twin guns of the larger Classic spacecraft. The seat is the old piece with a gap for the airtanks, which is great, and it has a desirable slope piece with the Classic Space logo on it.</p>

<p>The models aren&#39;t that much on their own, but they&#39;re inspiring me to build my own classic-inspired ship or mech or base to house them in so the Space Squad can explore alongside the Galaxy Explorer in their own setup. It&#39;s gonna be fun.</p>

<h3>Overall thoughts</h3>

<p>For the right people, this set is simply one of the best-value things LEGO have&nbsp;ever produced, period. Classic Space fans haven&#39;t been given anything this generous ever before. Even the fantastic-value 2022 Galaxy Explorer may not be&nbsp;as lavish for its&nbsp;price. Here, you get an affectionate poke at the old toys with Benny (or a really cheap way to get your favorite LEGO Movie character)&nbsp;and loving recreations with the other astronauts--these were the first figures to properly bring the old astronauts to life again, and, as of writing, this set is still the only way to get the recreated yellow astronaut. You also get a new astronaut color and some simple models that inspire creativity and&nbsp;have sweet and thought-out tributes to the classics with desirable parts. If you like Classic Space or have the 2022 Galaxy Explorer,&nbsp;your collection needs this set. It&#39;s well worth seeking on the aftermarket.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr"">It contain three parts. First one is a small bot, which is very simple and looks good. It is a super-classic iteration of space robot, in gray-blue colors. I may even say that he looks some kind of handsome.</p>

<p>Comes in a small box. The dimensions of the box are 5.6 x. 4.8 x 1.8 inches and weighs 0.2 pounds. Comes with small instruction booklet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There are a few cool parts. You get a metal detector, wrench, and a walkie-talkie, and space gun. These are accessories for the figures which are really nice pieces to get.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Benny:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Benny is the only figure who has a double-sided face. He has big smile on one side and sad expression on the other. His helmet is crack (which I really think is cool). He has the&nbsp;classic space logo on his torso. He has blue legs and jetpack. His accessory&nbsp;is a black walkie-talkie.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Kenny:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Kenny is the yellow space figure. His&nbsp;head is the classic Lego head. He&nbsp;has the classic space logo on his torso and has a yellow helmet, legs, and jetpack. His accessory is a black metal detector.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Lenny:</b></p>

<p>Lenny is the pink space figure. His&nbsp;head is also the classic Lego head. He has the classic space logo on his torso and has a pink helmet, legs, and jetpack. His accessory is a black wrench.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Jenny:</b></p>

<p>Jenny is the white space figure. Her&nbsp;head is the classic Lego head. She has&nbsp;the&nbsp;classic space logo on her torso and has a white helmet, legs, and jetpack. Her accessory is the space gun.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Robot:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This robot is really cool. It is only 8 pieces. The arms&nbsp;and the antenna are a nice feature. The light grey dish also provides nice stability to the robot as well. Overall a really cool robot.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy and took me around a less than 10 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall this is a great set and Lego should do more like these (whether it is space or another series). The vehicles are well done in portraying the classic space builds and not modernizing them at all. The figures are great. I love that they use the classic Lego head and not some newer head. I highly recommend this to anyone. This is a great classic space remake. I hope they continue to do more sets like these in the future. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"funfauto","2021-06-04T16:18:40.59Z","The 1980s were back in 2019 ","<h3>INTRO</h3>

<p>On release, this was amazing; a cheap, battlepack-like set for 1980&#39;s-era re-created space figures, alongside appropriate builds.</p>

<h3>FIGURES</h3>

<p>It seems that the point of this was to remake classic space style astronauts for the modern day. There are 3 true &quot;replica&quot; style figures included, with Benny being a distinct figure.</p>

<p>The 3 astronauts are identical bar colour, being pink, yellow and white. Wearing a faithful yet modernised helmet, incorporating newer molding design to produce a much more sturdy result. The figures also include gas tanks on the back, which is another iconic part of the space figure design from the era. The torso print is a HD-remake of the original print, using metallic gold for the planet part of the logo, plus defined lines that pop out from the backing colour. The texture of the inks produce good contrasts between them.</p>

<p>Benny is meant to be a 40-year-old space figure that has been battered, and uses a specific helmet that emulates a common break in the originals, being the offset chin-strap. The original helmets have a very thin band of material which breaks easily, being remedied here with both patterns of helmet, which have heavier build. Benny&#39;s torso has a faux-distressed look to the print, faking the decay of old prints. This works together very effectively.</p>

<p>There is also a robot-drone thing that is a callback to similar inclusions in classic sets, which makes sense as including a small extra reference is good for making the few parts count. Also included is a metal detector, radio, wrench and &quot;space blaster&quot; accessories.</p>

<h3>BUILD</h3>

<p>The builds are both completely relevant to the classic space theme. Designed so that they match the same style from the 1980s, feeling like a true homage.</p>

<p>The rover features a plank-like construction, with stuff being attached upwards, using the very traditional steering wheel element as the main decoration. Using modern elements in this build to great effect to counter the otherwise potentially boring assembly, with a clip being included for tools on the back.</p>

<p>The mini-ship could have been a polybag by itself - it follows the colours, shape and design features of classic sets, such as ll918. The light grey wing and blue top-structure, alongside the printed 2x4 slope with the space badge on it, creates a mini-me of the classic design pattern. This includes elements such as the antenna and red and green &quot;lights&quot; on the wings.</p>

<h3>CRITICISMS</h3>

<p>This comes down to being accurate to a point of nitpicking. The wheel hubs on the rover should probably have been red, to match up with old sets and to provide some in-theme colour variation.<br />
Some elements are dark grey, as it makes the parts easier to find and also brings it more inline with modern standards, but going against the limited palette of the 1980&#39;s sets.<br />
A nice to have would be a&nbsp;&quot;new&quot; condition helmet for Benny, allowing for use as a generic space figure.</p>

<p>Really though, those were so minor that it only bothers the most anorak-laden nerds, and really detracts nothing of any measure from the set overall.</p>

<p>The other one is that this did not start a wave of &quot;HD remix&quot; classic space sets, as the simple colours and styling is probably one of the most timeless of the lego ranges, and would be collected by fans of classic space within seconds of it releasing.</p>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p>This is a physical love letter to a very iconic and much-beloved theme from the far past. Nothing here is out of place, or glaringly off, and obvious care was taken to match up the design style. Each part is simple and purposeful, alongside an inexpensive price point at retail, results in a set that maximises the opportunity to celebrate classic space. Considering this angle, the simplicity is not an issue, as it is part of the style, and making it more complex would take away from the directness of the set.</p>

<p>This is a great model and a great LEGO set.</p>

<p>-the not using of classic space parts. For example: the &quot;metal detector&quot; does not have a stud on the bottom and&nbsp;the space gun is not the classic &quot;wrinkeled&quot;&nbsp;one,<br />
-the not using of classic building techniques. For example: the way the antenna is attached to the spaceship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For me,&nbsp;these issues are a big deal, and it is the reason&nbsp;why I cannot give this set 5 stars, even though I know, this set deserves to have 5 stars.I know this set is perfect, but it is exactly that fact, that makes it not perfect...at least for me....</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2020-09-08T07:10:15.41Z","Better battle pack than any Star Wars one, yeah I said it","<p>Ok, this set isn&rsquo;t a battle pack, but hey, it&rsquo;s got some similarities. So this review is coming from someone who doesn&rsquo;t have much (or any) connection to classic space, and yet, I really appreciate the existence of this set. This set gave me a taste of what adults nowadays loved from classic space, it&rsquo;s something very iconic to Lego, it&rsquo;s a tribute to their past, it&rsquo;s HISTORY.</p>

<h3><b>The Build</b></h3>

<p><strong>The Spaceship:</strong> Now since we&rsquo;re dealing with a set that takes heavy inspiration from a beloved Lego theme from the late 70s, expect the builds to be appropriately small and simple. The spaceship is a tiny build that only consists of 13 pieces. The front of the ship has blasters and a sloped brick with the classic space logo printed on it, that printed design only other appears in Emmet and Benny&rsquo;s &lsquo;Build and fix&rsquo; workshop, so I liked getting it here. A steering wheel is provided of course as well as a seat in blue to seat the driver well, an antenna is attached next to it also. Finally, at the back is a rocket booster. Overall, it&rsquo;s a really straightforward build like it should be, it&rsquo;s very simple and that&rsquo;s all it needs to be.</p>

<p><strong>The Lunar Buggy:</strong> Just like the spaceship, this is a very small build that consists of very little amount of pieces, specifically 22. The wheels on this vehicle are tiny and I love it. A steering wheel is included of course, as well as space to seat a figure to drive. A second space to seat a figure is also provided so that someone can tag along which was a good inclusion. 2 clips are at the back to hold accessories from the figures riding the buggy and I always like it when a vehicle has clips to hold accessories. Overall, another simple build that&rsquo;s still enjoyable.</p>

<p><strong>The Robot:</strong> This robot is a cute little build that also appeared in Benny&rsquo;s Spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP! So it&rsquo;s another small build that works well just like the other 2 builds and I also liked the parts used for it.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs&nbsp;</h3>

<p><strong>Benny:</strong> Benny stands out from the other figures of the set for having a different face print, helmet and torso printing. His legs are plain blue and his torso has the scratched up classic space logo to show some play wear. He has his blue air tanks as usual and his face prints are a big open smile and a worried face, both very nice for the character. The cracked helmet piece is here of course and I really liked the reference to how easy the helmets cracked back in the day. Finally, his accessory is a walkie-talkie. Overall, he&rsquo;s a really nice figure, not exclusive but I liked getting him here, I mean, who doesn&rsquo;t like Benny?</p>

<p><strong>Jenny, Lenny and Kenny:</strong> I&rsquo;m not going to take a look at each of them individually as they&rsquo;re pretty much the same, just in different colors (pink, yellow and white). The legs don&rsquo;t have printing like Benny and their torso is the classic space logo with a really nice golden shine, but this time, it&rsquo;s not scratched up. Air tanks are included of course and their face prints are the retro style smile face, getting 3 of them here is great. Their helmets are probably the best part about them as they were new pieces made for these figures, they&rsquo;re not cracked unlike Benny&rsquo;s helmet and they&rsquo;re a remake of the original helmet pieces, now durable enough to not chip easily, these helmets are fantastic! And finally the accessories included with these 3 figures are a metal detector, a blaster and a wrench, they could be given to any one of the figures as they aren&rsquo;t assigned to a specific character. One more thing is that Lenny (the pink spaceman) added a new color to the space suits, and I really like that this set not only pays tribute, but also adds new stuff to the lore of classic space. Overall, these figures are the best part of the set, they are amazing remakes of the original and I&rsquo;m really happy to own retro minifigures like these.</p>

<h3>Value For Money&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Do I even need to tell you that this set&rsquo;s value is fantastic? Look, these 4 minifigures alone are already worth the 10 bucks IMO, so the builds feel like a plus. Don&rsquo;t look at the PPP ratio, just look at the amount of minifigures and stuff you get here, it&rsquo;s great, and if you buy it with a discount like I did, even better! Honestly, this set&rsquo;s price makes CMFs look like an absolute joke (sorry CMF, I still love you). What can I tell you, it&rsquo;s just the perfect price.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The builds aren&rsquo;t anything special, but it&rsquo;s really intended to be that way, they&rsquo;re simple and that&rsquo;s perfectly fine. The minifigures are fantastic and a big part of what gives the set amazing&nbsp;value. This set obviously appeals more to adults, but I think it&rsquo;s something that can be enjoyed by people of all ages. I&rsquo;m really glad that Lego made this set, it&rsquo;s great that they revisited classic space so that people like me who&rsquo;s never had anything like this have a chance to get a taste of it for a very affordable price. So yeah, this is pretty much a perfect set, I&#39;d give it a 10/10 overall and I&nbsp;highly recommend this set to ANY fan of Lego.</p>

"Bogdan501st","2021-12-03T09:38:15.547Z","Cute tribute","<p>Of course, we all know this is a tribute to&nbsp;<em>Classic Space</em>. That is why I bought it. There are a lot of cool details in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Spaceship</strong></p>

<p>The only bad thing about the spaceship is the fact that there are no trans-yellow pieces to represent somewhat of a cockpit. I mean, look at any blue <em>Classic Space</em> spaceship. The combination is always present. And two trans-yellow cheese slopes would have been welcome. Actually, I bought this set a while ago. One cheese slope is included with the robot and there may be a spare part. Maybe you can do that with the pieces in the set.. The one it tries to mimic doesn&#39;t have the cheese slopes, but it isn&#39;t blue ;)</p>

<p><img alt=""Space | Classic | Brickset: LEGO set guide and database"" src=""https://images.brickset.com/sets/images/885-1.jpg"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;I like the spaceship overall and I especially enjoy the use of that vintage blue chair-like piece. After all, this set is a combination of new and old parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Rover</strong></p>

<p>The rover tries to recreate this set: LEGO 886 Space Buggy. Here is a photo:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://brickinsights.com/storage/sets/886-1.jpg"" /></p>

<p>I like its simple design and I appreciate that you can fit two minifigs on it. In fact, that is a cool thing about this set: everybody has something to do: Benny can pilot his spaceship, two minifigs can sit on the buggy(or rover, however you want to call it) and one can fix the robot.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Robot</strong></p>

<p>The same thing can be said about the robot: he is a C<em>lassic Space</em> robot, just reimagined. Look:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://img.brickowl.com/files/image_cache/larger/lego-classic-space-robot-droid-minifigure-31839-25.jpg"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new design is way more modern, but the old one is more charming ;)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigures are the reason I bought this set. And I must say I&#39;m disappointed.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t like the fact that Benny has such a specific design. I mean, I love Benny, but this just seems like stock clearance. As for the rest of them, I have no idea why, but their face prints are horrible quality. Their eye printing&nbsp;has&nbsp;almost completely chipped off! This has not happened to me, neither before nor afterwards.&nbsp;Other than that, the minifigures are good. Simple, just as they should be.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, this set is OK. The minifigures could have been better quality, but I like the set nonetheless.</p>

"mwerle","2022-07-07T02:20:25.583Z","Almost perfect nod back to classic space!","<p>Grabbed this set mostly for the classic Space minifigs, to round out my just-acquired Benny&#39;s Spaceship, Spaceship, SPACESHIP! set.</p>

<p>The builds do make use of some newer parts, and there are some very minor quibbles I have with the designs, but overall it&#39;s awesome!&nbsp; I rated the scores based on the original retail price (I paid a little bit more as it&#39;s no longer available in retail, and shipping to Japan is, as always, eye-wateringly expensive).</p>

<p>The builds were simple and mostly traditional. The only minor quibble I would have here is the way the antenna and tool clips are on the spaceship; yes, it&#39;s nifty and allows the use of smaller wings, but I would have preferred the slightly larger wings and a more traditional mounting for these.</p>

<p>Apart from that I can&#39;t really fault the spaceship; it has the classic blue/grey colour combination and a lovely classic Space logo on the front.</p>

<p>I have a few minor issues with the rover though:</p>

<p>1) the wheel hubs should have been red!!</p>

<p>2) it would have been nice to have a grey gas tank on the front, as (almost) all of the original rovers did.</p>

<p>3) it would have been nice to have a stud for mounting the robot instead of seating another minifig. And/or including an adapter piece.</p>

<p>4) no antenna... but I guess there&#39;s a walkie-talkie included.</p>

<p>As for the minifigs, absolutely love the almost perfect recreations of the classic Space minifigs! Only minor quibble is yet-another-Benny. Yes, I know, that&#39;s literally the title of the set.. but it would have been awesome if the set included a &quot;new&quot; blue torso and plain face for Benny as well, so that if you already have Benny, you could just have a generic blue spaceman as well.</p>

<p>EDIT: Just realised the metal detector has a new mould with no studs on the &quot;plate&quot;.. this limits its usability in MOCs...&nbsp; so chalk up another minor quibble ;)</p>

<p>Ultimately, these are incredibly minor things and yes, I am very nitpicky! Overall it&#39;s a great little set with good value-for-money. With a handful more pieces, it would be perfect!</p>
