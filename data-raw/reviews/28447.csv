<p>Emmets thricycle&nbsp;is first going to be seen in The lego movie 2 in February.I am writing this in January, so needless to say we have no idea about that movie.However,from trailer we know Emmet uses it in Apocalysburg.</p>

<p>3 SECTIONS WORKING IN PERFECT HARMONY</p>

<p>This set includes 174 pieces and(believe it or not) most of it is used on alien invader.However,by size it is smallest. So lets star with it. Like every alien invader,it is unique to this set with red bottom and orange &quot;head&quot;. The big eye is actually print,&cedil;and has one of only two functions in entire set. When you turn invader you can see little gray&nbsp;piece. That piece spins eye in circle. Not really funtions,but... The other function is &quot;eating&quot;.As we can see in one of the final trailers,alien attacks Emmet and eats the &quot;piece offering&quot;. So you can set invaders head all the way from 20 degrees to 160 degrees. Second section od gas station that can also be divided in 3 sections. First one is gas station that doesnt&nbsp;really do anything because thricycle&nbsp;is too high. Second one is shooter. It is basicly&nbsp; one thire put on clip that doesnt&nbsp;&quot;stick&quot; to it and it is easy to fire. It is use to hit invader. The middle section is just parking spot for thricycle. The thricycle&nbsp; is 4 minfigs tall(five with Emmet) and has place for one minifig&nbsp;plus Planty.</p>

<p>PROS&nbsp;</p>

<p>-good looking</p>

<p>-cheap</p>

<p>-fun to build</p>

<p>-you get the minifig&nbsp;of Emmet</p>

<p>-you can buy it before the realise&nbsp;of movie because it is not really big spoiler</p>

<p>-it doesnt&nbsp;take lot of place</p>

<p>CONS</p>

<p>-smaller than it seems</p>

<p>-lot of stickers</p>

<p>OVERALL</p>

<p>There is no such thing as a &quot;perfect set&quot; but this one is really close so if you wanna buy it, dont wait.</p>

"legoman624","2019-01-29T00:49:49.143Z","70823 Emmet's Thricycle","<p>This set from The Lego Movie 2 is very interesting, showing the creativity that can be involved in Lego building. The gas pump for the thricycle has a faded Octan sign, showing the time that has passed since the Duplo invasion. It also contains a tire launcher and a docking station for the thricycle. The thricycle itself has 3 wheels, only one of which is needed, a control station for Emmet, and of course, Emmet&#39;s best friend, Planty!&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-02-06T13:12:07.817Z","Three-Wheels, More Fun??? Emmet Thinks so Anyway.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #70823 Emmet&rsquo;s Thricycle!: </b>This set is one of the smaller ones from The LEGO Movie 2 theme and features a rather cute looking model, but it was barely in the film and is probably a set you&rsquo;ll be skipping out on. Especially if you already own an Emmet Minifigure from this set. However it&rsquo;s a pretty quirky design and I definitely think you should give it a chance. And we&rsquo;ll discuss why during the course of this review.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The box here is fairly odd, it stands up rather than lays horizontally on the shelf with the image showcased on the front being vertical as well. Which makes sense as the model in this set is mostly a massive vertical one. The back shows off all the features fairly nicely.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I am not certain if this was introduced with any other themes before, or if it began with The LEGO Movie 2 sets, but the manual for this model has an image repeat from the front of the box and two little numbered baggies in the corner indicating how many bags it should include when first opened. This is a rather tiny manual too, but has not been creased or folded in any way. The steps are perfectly fine as well, easy to follow along with and no instances of frustration. A sticker sheet is included.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set doesn&rsquo;t feature a whole lot of unique, rare, or interesting parts. You get your standard Brick elements, a three-stem plant element in green and another in brown, large tires and rims to put them on, or hubcaps, or whatever the official name is and a few hinge elements and the like for vehicle builds. Fairly typical stuff.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Emmet: This version of Emmet includes no accessories and can be found in 8 sets, sharing the exact same print and parts. In fact according to my collection I already own four of him, and as he is the only Minifigure in the set it&rsquo;s a bit of a shame LEGO didn&rsquo;t take this opportunity to make him unique in some fashion. Or at least included an extra character to go with him.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: The initial build is begun by Emmet, he makes a &lsquo;Duplo Invader&rsquo; in orange and red and then a small gas station area which has been left over after the Invasion Event decimated Bricksburg. It&rsquo;s all fairly straight forward and quite simple. A few of the stickers are used for the gas pump build, but these should be easy enough to apply with little issue.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: This build is exceptionally quick, if a tad complicated while you are working on it. The Thricycle model rests on three wheels&hellip; I honestly don&rsquo;t understand Emmet&rsquo;s mental mindscape when it comes to these models, but they are quite interesting builds. Some stickers are applied liberally for additional detailing, caution stripes mostly, but the rest of the build is quick and fun&hellip; just remember it won&rsquo;t balance on its own until you have the complete model finished.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Thricycle: This three-wheeled monstrosity is basically a massive unicycle enhanced with extra wheels. I have no idea why, Emmet seems to build everything this way. Double-Decker couches, Triple-Decker Couches&hellip; He must really like tall things. The physical model has very little trouble balancing thanks to the additional &lsquo;kickstand&rsquo; elements, and you can store Planty next to Emmet as he rides. Overall a fairly solid model, though there aren&rsquo;t really any play features here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Duplo Invader: This orange and red beastie from the Planet Duplo is here to chomp and cause harmless mischief I&rsquo;d imagine. LEGO has cleverly allowed you to build these models up with ordinary LEGO bricks and the effect is quite stunning. It really captures the look and feel of actual Duplo bricks, although I&rsquo;m not entirely certain if DUPLO includes hinged elements or not. My exposure to the piece pool of DUPLO is rather limited I&rsquo;m afraid. But this character build is actually quite impressive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Gas Pump: A fairly simple little side-build that allows you to fuel up your Thricycle with minimum effort. It can be used to store the Thricycle as well in a little off-loading area, mostly fun, and a nice bit of side-build to enhance the play factor of this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is nice, I honestly did not think I would get it personally as it doesn&rsquo;t really feature anything too unique, aside from the Duplo Invader character build who is unique to the set with these colours. There are no play features either, no flick-fire missiles, no stud shooters, nothing of that sort. What you can do is launch a wheel hubcap piece and that&rsquo;s about it, it&rsquo;s such a minimalistic play feature I almost forgot about it. Overall a nice set to get on sale to add to your Apocalypseburg display, but not really a must have unless you are looking to get every set from the Theme.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I would list this set as Mildly Recommended. The models are quite clever and engaging and you can rarely go wrong there. Still I&rsquo;d wait for a sale, or try to build it out of pieces from your own collections. It is definitely not worth the full Canadian MSRP, especially with only a single Minifigure included in the set.</p>

"BJNemeth","2020-02-01T19:27:08.08Z","Unbalanced Thricycle","<p>This is a cute little set, and the Thricycle looks great as a tall little display piece that doesn&#39;t take up much room on a desk or a shelf. The only problem -- and it&#39;s a big one -- is that it is very easy to tip over, and the little kickstands at the bottom have to be in just the right position and on a&nbsp;very flat surface&nbsp;to support it. I think if the stands were just one stud longer, it would be more stable without impeding the playability.</p>

<p>I do like that when you roll it along the ground, the wheels all spin off of each other like gears to give it a very dynamic look.</p>

<p>I really want to like this set, and I love how it looks. But not being able to stand up reliably is a&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;big dealbreaker. I plan to keep it around until I build Apocalypseburg, and then I may put it on display with that set and attach it to something so it can&#39;t easily tip over.</p>
