With that being said, I didn&rsquo;t go after this until it was discounted but was definitely pleased with my purchase.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Minifigures 4/10&nbsp;</strong>&ndash; The minifigures of Rex Dangervest and Emmet are a necessary inclusion but nothing outstanding. The real prize is the Raptor figures. Their dark blue and medium blue highlighted colors give a very cool darker feel to Lego dinosaurs and remind me of the sheer terror I felt while watching the raptors hunt in the kitchen during the original Jurassic Park movie.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>The Build</strong>&nbsp;8/10&ndash; The &ldquo;ship&rdquo; was the main draw for me and I loved the build. It very much felt like I was building a new style of Star Wars ship and the only repetition was building the engines 4x over. The finishing touches of angles and smooth pieces give this ship an aerodynamic sleekness with the huge internal area allowing for a ton of internal storage. Plus easy access with the folding side panels. Again, this thing feels like you could drop it down in the background of a Star Wars scene full of cargo and it would fit right in! The Rear ramp was a personal favorite inclusion. The two cockpit locations are built for the raptors so it will take some modification to make it work for minifigures but it&rsquo;s manageable.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Parts</strong>&nbsp;7/10&ndash; This dark blue color is becoming more available across the Lego sets and if you are wanting dark blue parts, this set is full of them. Personally I love the bright yellowish-green colored bricks. They add such a nice splash of color on this dark set. The stickers also add to the striping but aren&rsquo;t extremely important to the look. There are a ton of finishing pieces in this set as well as structural technic building parts to use in any mocs if you decide to tear this bad boy apart.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Value</strong>&nbsp;6/10 - I got this set for 50% off the retail price on sale, and to get 1100+ bricks for $60 is a great deal anytime you can find it! At the retail price it wouldn&rsquo;t be in my collection. I&rsquo;m not a huge Lego movie guy so it wasn&rsquo;t a must have for me. I was definitely interested in it as I love the look and feel of it, but the initial price was too much of a hill to climb. Now that I have the set, it definitely feels like a $90 set in my mind. It has a good physical size to it which creates a sense of value as well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><strong>Overall</strong>&nbsp;8/10 &ndash; This set surprised me at how much fun it was to build and the overall amount of space you have inside. This is basically a big cargo ship with huge side panel doors, a rear ramp, and 2 cockpits. The side builds and minifigs don&rsquo;t really do much to impress me. The Raptors are cool and would flawlessly fit into any Jurassic park collection. I&rsquo;m a Star Wars collector that enjoys mods and mocs so this was the perfect candidate to take a really good set and mod it to fit my own collection nicely. If you can find it on sale and like the dark blue color scheme, id highly recommend this set! Enjoy!</p>
