<p>It&#39;s great to be able to have the Duplo visitors from the movie, but two of them are not the right ones from the ending. It would&#39;ve been better to have those, but it&#39;s still good to have the middle one here. But other than that, there&#39;s not much for playability unless you&#39;re in the Duplo age range, but even then, there&#39;s still not much. Parts are mediocre due to the characters being made of random blocks.&nbsp;The building experience was so quick. The price definitely should&#39;ve been $5 less.</p>
