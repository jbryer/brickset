There are no stickers, so you wont need to worry about them being place wrong or crocked.&nbsp;<br />
This set triggers children&#39;s imagination: I can see them fueling the car, doing maintenance on&nbsp;the spaceship, maybe having a race etc etc...</p>

<p>There are, on the other hand, also some negative things about this set: yet again, LEGO manages to use odd colors in visible places: the white tires on the buggy and the 2 white 1x4 plates on the&nbsp;spaceship really hurt my eyes!&nbsp;Why oh Why aren&#39;t they gray/grey like they should be? The build is sometimes also to oversimplified: especially the car. I mean, If you have no problem with 4yo building the maintenance cart, then why make the car&nbsp;so overly simple?</p>

<p>PROS:</p>

<p>-classic space vibe<br />
-no stickers!!<br />
-nice selection of useful pieces (of you are into space)<br />
-Benny (you cant get enough Bennys)</p>

<p>CONS:</p>

<p>-build is too simplified, even for a 4yo<br />
-printing on the pieces is slightly off (come on LEGO)<br />
-strange color choices.</p>

<p>Is the set a must-have? In no way. Even not when you bought it&nbsp;because of the classic-space vibe (like I did).&nbsp;Get it at discount, or simply settle with Benny;s space squad.</p>
