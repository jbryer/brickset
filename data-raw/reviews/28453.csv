<p>IMHO one of the most intriguing sets to appear in the Lego Movie 2 range was Metalbeard&#39;s Sea Cow. I like the ridiculousness of the Metalbeard&nbsp;character, and this trike seemed to be just as crazy. The build is easy and fairly quick. There are no stickers. Overall I like the design, which seems to be inspired by Metalbeard&#39;s&nbsp;Sea Cow itself - with a high forecastle and stern. I It is mostly well finished, few if any off-colour pieces are visible (thankfully). The minifigures/characters are nice. I like the shark with the eye-patch.</p>

<p>Overall this is a fun set, with, all things considered a barely&nbsp;acceptable price. The price is high, but then again, there are quite a few big and unique pieces (Benny, angry Sweet Mayhem, the wheels, the shark).</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build is fairly quick and easy. No stickers, no tricky or difficult sub-assemblies. It all comes together quickly, in about 60 minutes. The build sequence is logical. There are quite a few off-colour&nbsp;pieces used early on in the construction, but those are thankfully covered up from most sides. There is quite a bit of stud-on-side construction for the sides of the trike. I did not come across many special pieces: the wheels are nice, the guns as well.</p>

<p>The recommended age is 7+. I did not see anything that makes me think that younger children would not be able to build the set. There one potential issue I see is the many small pieces used in the construction. There are quite a few spare pieces, and one of the most interesting ones is a spare/second blaster for Sweet Mayhem</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are two official minifigures in this set: Angry Sweet Mayhem and Apocalypse Benny. Both of them are actually unique to this set.</p>

<p>Apocalypse Benny has a damaged classic spaceman torso, and a helmet with a damaged (and fixed) chin strap. He has a nice cyborg right arm, a welding apparatus carried on the back, and a welding visor attached to the helmet. He has two faces, a happy face and a scared/sad face. They are well done.</p>

<p>Sweet Mayhem itself is found in other sets, but angry Sweet Mayhem is not. Personally I am not a fan of the Sweet Mayhem style of minifigures, but I have to say, this one is well done. She The wings are nice, the print is excellent. An added bonus is the option to have her wear a normal hair cut rather than a helmet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The little star is not listed as a minifigure, but is a nice character to add. If nothing else, it could become a decorative piece in another MOC.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The trike seems to be inspired by something steam-punk, motor gang and Metalbeard&#39;s&nbsp;Sea Cow mixed together. The whole shape of of the main body resembles that of an old galleon - the engine depicting the high forecastle, and Metalbeard&#39;s&nbsp;body corresponds to the stern of the ship. The engine design is very good and convincing. I like Metalbeard&#39;s arms: the dual cannon and the shark-shooter. The shark-to-be-shot-with-metal-eye-patch is a highlight of the set. The crow&#39;s nest is nice, and pretty much the only place where a minifigure&nbsp;can be put. =</p>

<p>The weakest part of the build is the front fork. It definitely looks nice, but there is quite a bit if flex in them. There is also plenty of room for torque, so in theory rough play might end up deforming the Technic beams.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>Despite the somewhat week fork, the trike seems great to ride around. The three shooters work well, though the ammo for the guns - once shot - might be hard to find.&nbsp;The trike can be handled easily by kids. There are some small details attached but by and large they seem to not come off too easily.</p>

<p>The Heavy Metal Motor Trike is also quite a nice display piece. It is well finished enough, few truly ugly elements are visible. It would work well as a display piece.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>MetalBeard&#39;s Heavy Metal Motor Trike is a set the looks of which you either like or dislike. I liked the build, and the result is a suitably crazy vehicle.&nbsp;I also like the result. The minifigure characters are good and fun. The biggest issue is its RRP. It is quite high, and overall the set is not extremely big. Overall, I think it a nice set, but see if you can get it at a discount.</p>
