"SuperBunny","2019-02-23T04:15:30.227Z","So cool","<p>Bought this along with the Chinese New Year meal set. Loved it a lot.</p>

<p>I really liked the set as it is not just a still image but able to be played with. I liked the look of the parts. Was originally worried if the scales were generic but they are made to look like they go one way so if you put them on the wrong way round it will look different. I also liked the path, it felt pretty zen making it.</p>

<p>My issues with it is that most of the inside and the dragon itself had similar designed parts so there was a lot of repetition which felt dull. Also while the horns were a nice way or reusing existing Lego pieces once I saw what they were made of I could not unsee them</p>

<p>What I really would like someone smarter than me do is to fit a music box gimmick in there. While making this set, making the inside was fun and put me in mind of music boxes.</p>

<p>What we did was to replace the head of the pig costume minifigure with deadpools head. We also put deadpool on the dragons head with the ball on the fishing rod</p>

"trippy21","2019-05-19T07:05:37.78Z","Great display, poor movement","<p>This set is a superb display piece, the scale of the dragon and minfigs works really well, as well as the colour&nbsp;of the dragon. The re-use of the BB8 body part which has been re-painted for the pole operated by the Pig suit guy is brilliant and the rotating function ties in nicely with the dragon movement.</p>

<p>The build is quite straight forward,&nbsp;but there is quite a bit of replication, as you would expect in this model where six sections of&nbsp;the dragon are the same.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My problem with this set is the movement of the Dragon. Lego have set the mechanics up to give two ripples of a sinusoid wave in the body and with only nine sections there isn&#39;t enough sections&nbsp;to give the visual definition of a sinusoid! Also the vertical movement isn&#39;t very smooth so it looks quite blocky when the sections move up and down again detracting from the sinusoid movement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a shame, to be honest, as Lego have made the effort to make this a set that can be displayed and played with, but the movement is all wrong. I did find on JK Brickworks YouTube channel a guide to improving the movement which makes this set a 10/10.</p>
