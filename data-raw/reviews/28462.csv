Similarly, the Dragon Boat Race set represents a number of positive qualities associated with sportsmanship.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The whole series of new, predominantly China-inspired sets has generated so much buzz&nbsp;we can only speculate why but one thing is clear - it&#39;s a new direction for non-fantasy, non-sci-fi Lego sets and although Lego has been fascinated by Asian culture and tradition for some time (the whole Ninjago theme for example), this &#39;normal&#39; and people-centric set offers something quite different.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I&#39;ve already mentioned, it&#39;s a figure-based set and you get fifteen minifigs, five civilians (quite common figs) and ten sportsmen which are really worth getting in my opinion - not just for their amazing&nbsp;torsos but they also feature a plethora of funky and less common hairstyles. Only a couple of minifigs have alternate faces, however.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The boats themselves look unlike anything I&#39;ve seen with Lego sets. I&#39;m no expert on Asian culture&nbsp;but I find the boats beautiful and they employ some rather interesting building techniques for the dragon heads ornaments and include a number of less usual elements and recolours. I think everybody will be shocked by the use of a certain croissant piece!&nbsp;<br />
Included are some auxiliary builds to complement the scene and I believe they succeed as well. You will certainly appreciate some of the detailing and exclusive printed pieces (however, be warned, there are some stickers - which I traditionally refuse to&nbsp;apply - they are nice but mostly cosmetic anyway).&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an adult it&#39;s always quite difficult for me to judge the play value. The boats come with tiny wheels, so they can be moved on non-carpeted surfaces, you can pose a large number of minifigs, even create some fierce paddle battles...&nbsp;</p>

<p>For me personally it&#39;s a great display set. If you own any Ninjago City sets, it will be a worthy addition to your collection. The price and the value seem reasonable, especially if you get it with some VIP points or better as a gift.&nbsp;</p>
