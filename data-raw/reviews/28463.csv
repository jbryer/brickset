191118: How to get smaller turning circle</em>)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a big fan of technic cars, I prefer construction machines.<br />
Therefore I bought this set as source of orange parts: You won&#39;t get disappointed, there are many of them. And, of course, the extra benefits:<br />
<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6224999/angled-gear-wheel-z20-w-4-85-hole"">20-tooth clutch gear</a>&nbsp; and the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6182551/tyre-normal-narrow-dia-43x14-no-1"">narrow 43.2x14 tires</a>.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42093/img_0186k.png"" style=""width: 400px; height: 338px;"" /></p>

<h3>The box</h3>

<p>You get a rectangular box. The finished model is ca. 5 cm (2&quot;) both shorter and narrower than its front side. (Height is about correct so that you can use the cardbox as a garage for your Corvette.)<br />
The box is, as with many other sets, about 50% filled. The sticker set is loose and the single instruction book not sealed in a bag.<br />
The parts are in unnumbered bags.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Remark I: You can save the new cogwheel to your spare parts as it is used in a 12:20:12 transmission of the steering. You can use 16-tooth gears instead in steps 18.3 and 22 (<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4640536/gear-wheel-z16"">use this</a>) respectively step 20 (use <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6100930/gear-wheel-z16-w-%C3%B8-4-85"">this</a> or one of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-6542"">those</a>).</p>

<p>Building starts at the rear axle and commences towards the front of the car. After step 69 you could mount the wheels to the chassis for some test driving.</p>

<p>Remark II: If you would like to try wider wheels, e.h. 43.2x20 or 49.2x20 on the rear axle you&#39;ll need to make changes: In step #134(#140) us a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4514553/connector-peg-w-friction-3m"">3L friction pin</a> and attach the lower <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6073231/single-bush-2m-%C3%B84-9"">Single Bush</a> in step #136(#142) to it.</p>

<p>The rear part of the chassis - starting from the &#39;doors&#39; is fixed in a slanted way that is fixed to the body at three points: Two at the back and (left+right side) just behind the seats.</p>

<p>Just before you put on the wheels in the last step (#206) the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6249344/shell-3x9x2-w-4-85-hole-no-1"">new curved shell pieces</a> are installed. Until then I found the chassis to look rather squarish and flat.</p>

<p>There are a few stickers. I did not apply them as usual. I think the only &#39;important&#39; ones are those that are put on the roof to break the square appearance of it.</p>

<h3>Final Model</h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42093/img_0202k.png"" /></p>

<p>The finished model looks really good. It doesn&#39;t look squarish (as just mentioned) any more. The orange-and-black colour combination is stunning. The single line of the slanted rear implies speed and dynamic.<br />
However, the rear wheel-arches appear to be too wide for the wheels. Also, because of the skewed setup, the wheel is not centered but displaced (ca.) 1/2 stud towards the front.</p>

<p>What scale has this model? I haven&#39;t calculated. The technic figure is at smaller scale. I wouldn&#39;t put the Corvette and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42078-1/Mack-Anthem"">Mack</a> on the same scale but the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42009-1"">42009 mobile crane</a> might fit.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42093/img_0216k.png"" style=""width: 480px; height: 283px;"" /></p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p>There is a small V8 &quot;motor&quot; that is driven from the rear axle via differential.<br />
The sound when pushing the car around is much better that than the movement of the &quot;cylinders&quot;.<br />
If you happen to have the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42078-1/Mack-Anthem"">Mack</a> at hand: Play with them side by side and compare the &quot;sound&quot; from their engines.</p>

<p>Steering is achieved by means of a 12-tooth wheel at the rear. The transmission runs through the whole car. There is no gear-rack to turn the front wheels but a small lever. During build (see above) you may already have noticed that the steering angle is very limited: Front wheel suspension is mounted next to a beam that does not allow for bigger turning angles.</p>

<p>There are no other functions present on the Corvette model.</p>

<h3>Criticism</h3>

<ul>
	<li>The turning circle of the car appears to be too big. That is owed to the limitation of the suspension. I don&#39;t now if this resembles the real car but on a Lego model you would like to have a 180&deg; turn even on your desk.</li>
	<li>I consider the rear spoiler to be too far from the car.</li>
	<li>There is a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6123815/beam-1m-w-cross-axle"">single grey piece</a> on the front hood. This could have been easily replaced by an orange part.</li>
	<li>The lower rear part, left and right from the exhaust pipes looks unfinished</li>
	<li>The interior of the car also appears unfinished: The car dashboard is only on the left, drives side.</li>
	<li>The 5L orange beam at the front should be rotated by 90&deg; so that the closed side gets looked at.</li>
</ul>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42093/img_0208k.png"" /></p>

<h3>Changes</h3>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Replace light grey parts in the cabin by black ones for better look.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Put some panels to the lower rear.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6161155/beam-1x1"">silvery 1L beams</a> for the exhaust pipes.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Use grey 1/2 stoppers and 3L axles to for the cylinders of the machine. The brown-and-yellow does not work for me.</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Put 43.2x20 wheel on the rear axle. If you are used to wide technic wheels the new ones simply don&#39;t look right.</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>To get a &#39;better&#39; steering - e.g. smaller tuning radius - few changes will make a big difference:</p>

<ul>
	<li>In Step 64 on page 41 replace the 9M beam by a 7M beam. Center it so that only one of the blue 3L pins connects with the grey part underneath. Place the second on to the grey connector only as indicated.</li>
	<li>Haven&#39;t checked impact: In Step 67 / Sub-step 4 do not use the blue half pins. Steering will work without them.</li>
	<li>In Step 69 (p 47) do not use the yellow half bushings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the car will be much more sensitive to steering with theses changes.</p>

"J14T14","2019-04-29T17:42:58.91Z","""Like a Rock""","<p>I have been wanting to get a complex Technic car for a while, but they have just always been out of my price range, until now. This $50 set is pretty nice in my opinion and I don&#39;t think that it deserves all the negative reviews it has been receiving from people like JangBricks [Sorry Jang!&nbsp;I love your videos, but I have to politely disagree with your opinion that you stated in your review (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44fFG7s2HrI"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44fFG7s2HrI</a>)]</p>

<p>There are not a lot of functions in this set. You can steer the wheels from the back, and the&nbsp;wheels are connected to the &quot;motor&quot; in the front. The &quot;pistons&quot; move up and down and the back wheels have a build in differential. That is it. There are no other functions with this set. This is one of the major complaints I have seen about this set. The hood and trunk to not open, nor do the doors.</p>

<p>Another complaint that I have seen is that the car itself is &quot;ugly.&quot; It is a little short in length/ a bit tall in height when compared to the real life car. I don&#39;t mind this and I think that it still loos pretty good for it&#39;s size. There are two simulated seats inside as well as a steering wheel (it isn&#39;t connected to the wheels, so it doesn&#39;t tur when they do). There is aso a representation of four&nbsp;exhaust pipes in the rear of the car. The one thing that I do not like about the look is the height of the rear spoiler, but that can easily be modified.</p>

<p>Overall, I really like this car. It is a nice starting point to those who want the larger Technic cars, but can&#39;t afford them. Is it as detailed or have as many functions as those cars? No, but it doesn&#39;t have to. It is a $50 set, not a $150- $250 set. I think that this car does it&#39;s purpose and does it well enough. While some extra features would have been nice, I ultimately&nbsp;think that they were not necessary for this size and scale.</p>

"lemish34","2020-07-13T13:41:55.093Z","Surprisingly substantial and challenging set, looks great on display!","My first ever review on Brickset, after reading daily for the past year and a half!
From the moment I saw this set, I knew I would one day own it (but at significant discount - I refuse to pay full retail!) - I love cars, especially swoopy sports cars, and the bright orange colour really drew me in.
I was surprised with some of the negative reviews I read about this set (mainly criticising the overall shape, and the lack of Technic functions), but they didn’t deter me at all.
I was delighted to pick up this set for $30 Australian (about US$20) in box, opened but never built (who buys sets to open them but NOT build?!) - far below RRP / MSRP! 

PROS:
Beautiful Bright orange colour (divisive opinion, I’m sure!).
Some nice and uncommon pieces, particular in the colour orange.
Pumping pistons as the car rolls along (& makes a nice sound - I pretend it’s a V8 roar!) - feature works nicely.
Very swooshable!, along a flat surface (Can you swoosh a car??).
Car is larger & more substantial than I expected.
Challenging build - one of the harder sets I can ever recall doing (I’ve built hundreds of sets, many over 2,000 pieces, over the last 30+ years - though there was a Dark Age of around 20yrs in the middle! - though granted mainly System sets. I’m not sure how it compares to newer Technic sets, particularly larger ones, as I’ve only built this and 42074 racing yacht), 
Over 200 steps in the instruction manual, which surprised me given how relatively small the set is - which led to a solid 1.5 - 2hr build, at a relatively leisurely pace.
Box is bright and enticing and there’s some great artwork (photos) of real Corvettes both on the rear of the box and in the instruction manual.

CONS:
At full retail price, it’s only average value.
The Model could be slightly more realistic in shape, particularly around the front bonnet and front lip/spoiler - but with the limitations of LEGO pieces and the size of the model, I’m unsure how it could have been done much better?
Opening doors would have been nice - for much of the build, I did think they opened (but almost scissor-style), until some pins and beams were applied towards the end that fixed the doors in place.
Only 2 functions: pumping pistons, and steering - operated via a protruding axle at the rear.
Definitely needs a shorter axle sticking out at the rear, so that the steering mechanism isn’t so obvious & protruding! Such an easy fix for the LEGO designers!

Overall, a great set that I’m very happy with, that has one simple but nice function, and looks great on the shelf!

"DoonsterBuildsLego","2021-05-01T20:25:16.293Z","A nice little model with a good alternative build and good playability","<p>After having built <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42098-1/Car-Transporter"">42098 Car Transporter</a>, I primarily built this as an addition to that set, given that this is nicely size compatible. I was actually much more impressed with the set overall than just as an addition to the transporter: a nice main model, a good B model (electronic instructions) and good parts.</p>

<p>The build is quite nice, nothing too fancy building up in stages. There is a full rear differential driving the V8 engine at the front. I found the sequence to be pretty good and enjoyable, no fiddly bits and everything feeling quite logical.</p>

<p>In addition, there is a B model available from the Lego website (download instructions) to build a quite nice hot rod model from this. I really like that model, so much so I bought a second copy to have both models built. The hot rod is also quite modifiable if you&#39;ve got some extra parts: I&#39;ve tweaked the lights and fitted wider rear wheels to make it even more authentic as a hot rod.</p>

<p>I like the parts, especially the quantity of orange and the curved panels for the roof. This had me buying a third copy just as a parts pack. The under working, gears etc are all pretty straightfoward, so it&#39;s really the orange that is the parts attraction here.</p>

<p>The final model is very solid and zooms around nicely, although the turning circle (like most Technic models) is quite large. The engine clacks along nicely, giving an impression of a V8. Plus, it&#39;s fully compatible with the Car Transporter, greatly enhancing the play value if you have that set, too.</p>

<p>At full price I think it&#39;s reasonable value for the main model, but for the B model and for parts it&#39;s worth waiting for a discount &mdash; it can regularly be bought quite a bit lower than retail.</p>

"Karidian","2021-04-26T01:22:40.93Z","Nice Quick Build!","<p>Starting to appear that my builds are focused on vehicles, which I am enjoying building.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was intrigued by this kit because it could be built two different ways.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did this one as the car, but we may buy another one of this kit and build that one as the hot rod and display side by side.&nbsp;&nbsp; The instructions were good, but the bags were not numbered, so had 4-5 small trays of parts going at the same time of all the parts from each bag.&nbsp;&nbsp; At times had to hunt for the correct part from all the trays.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am getting better at knowing which part will probably be in which tray, but it doesn&#39;t always work out that way.&nbsp;&nbsp; This would be a excellent&nbsp; and inexpensive build for someone who hasn&#39;t worked with LEGO before as an introduction to the hobby.&nbsp;&nbsp; Thumbs up for sure.</p>
