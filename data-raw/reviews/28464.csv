<p>This set contains one Sith infiltrator microfighter and one Darth Maul Minifigure.</p>

<p>The Minifigure is pretty cool and is like most other Darth Maul Minifigures. He includes some nice cloak printing, and a double bladed light saber!</p>

<p>The Sith Infiltrator is about the normal size of a Microfighter&nbsp;and looks pretty good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It includes somewhat&nbsp;movable wings, stud shooters and space for Darth Maul.</p>

<p>Overall i think this set is fun and is a must have for any Lego star wars microfighter collection.</p>

<strong>Model</strong><br />
I like the whole concept of Sith Infiltrator. It&#39;s for me one of the best ships in prequel trilogy. Here we have it for the first time in Microfighter format. And I must say, it is great. The model is designed perfectly. I don&#39;t see many flaws. Shapes are good, colors are done well. It has some small details such as roller skates, studs with pin, that are hardly ever seen on set like this. Wings are made pretty well, but they don&#39;t fold like in bigger version. Rounded part around canopy is fine. Stud shooters are on their place, and don&#39;t look so bad, as sometimes. What bothers me is this tile at the nose. It looks of the place, and rises the nose too much. Windscreen made of two cheese slopes in trans red are good. One of the best looking part of this model is engine. It is just a tile in trans light green, but as it is sunk into model between wings, it makes it work. At the bottom there are two trans clear plates to make the ship fly.</p>

Fig can be easily placed on its seat. Has no console, and no place to hold its weapon. Great thing about this set is, how easy it is to convert it to typical model. Stud shooter can be replaced by cheese slopes in dark grey, and canopy must be filled with some normal bricks, and there you have it. So model deserve a solid 5 stars.</p>

<strong>Minifig</strong><br />
We got here one guy: darth Maul. It is the cheapest way to buy him. I don&#39;t have to mention that he is a great character, very important not only to Phantom Menace, but also to Clone Wars and Rebels. He is here in his traditional black robe, which is greatly printed. I especially like his thick belt. He also had some small printing on his legs. His face though, is printed all over. He has the same scary look for couple years now, and I don&#39;t see a need to change it. As a final touch we get his &quot;crown&quot;, which gives him even more villainous look. Only missing thing is his cape, but LEGO usually doesn&#39;t put capes in Microfighters. And he has his double lightsaber of course.</p>

<strong>Parts</strong><br />
Around a hundred of them. Some, like curved bricks are pretty common, yet still useful, some, like roller skates or quarter round tiles are much less popular. It is a good pieces bank.</p>
