"gdr36","2020-03-19T13:36:10.633Z","75894 Mini Coopers","<p>Overview: This set was released in January 2019 for $50 in the United States. It includes 2 drivers, a pit worker, and a spectator, along with 2 Mini Coopers and a pit stop.</p>

<p>Minifigs: None of the minifigs stand out very much as being special. The S-Rally driver is&nbsp;very bland looking and the spectator is made up of common parts, but there is a cool torso for the John Cooper Works Buggy driver and the pit worker.</p>

<p>Build: This takes a while to build. There are many stickers to apply, especially on the 2018 model. The S Rally has very cool building techniques used and is a unique 5-wide build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts: I&#39;m not a parts expert but the Mini Cooper S Rally introduces a new fender piece and incorporates a lot of newer pieces in cool colors into the build. Both cars use wheels different than the regulation Speed Champions one. The pit stop includes cool pillar pieces and roller coaster track.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The models:</p>

<p>2018 MINI John Cooper Works Buggy: This car is a bit clunky but looks much better in person than in pictures online. It really is a beast. The best part of the car, in my opinion, is the working suspension. It isn&#39;t independent suspension but it works perfectly and kids would have a lot of fun driving it around the house. This model looks great when compared to the source material but it just isn&#39;t the prettiest looking car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1967 Mini Cooper S Rally:</p>

<p>This car is a gem. It&#39;s made up of about 150 pieces, which is surprising, considering how small it is compared to other Speed Champions models. The best part about this car is that it looks exactly like the real thing that won the Monte Carlo Rally. From the classic livery to the brake light at the back and the tires on the roof, its accuracy is impressive. One thing that is weird about the car is that a clear window piece is placed right behind the driver, making the space for him to sit&nbsp;in very cramped. I just removed it and the driver could lean back in a more realistic position. The only con I can see besides that is that&nbsp;the Mini looks weird next to my other&nbsp;Speed Champions being about&nbsp;half the size of some of them. I just took the stickers off the car and put it in front of my modular building, where it looks&nbsp;great.</p>

<p>Pit Stop:</p>

<p>The best part of the set is obviously the cars, and I get the feeling that not many people really wanted a large pit stop to bump up the price of this set. It includes tools, a trophy, and some carts.&nbsp;The most interesting part of the pit stop is probably the stickers representing TVs showing the cars racing. The last part of the build is a stand to place your 2018 model on with a bed for the pit worker to lie down on. This whole build is really much better as a parts pack than a pit stop because it uses interesting pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value for Money: The value in this set is not ideal. The cars together cost $30 and the pit stop area is not worth $20 in my opinion. This set&nbsp;definitely would be better sold at $40 and even then that&#39;s still steep when you realize that the Dodge set costs $30 and has almost the same piece&nbsp;count as the Minis.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Verdict: A really great set for any fan of Speed Champions or fan of Mini. The 2018 model is about average, while the S Rally is one of the best builds the Speed Champions line has to offer. The pit lane, while having some nice details, is the weakest part of the set and pretty boring. If you want this set, I would recommend buying it at $40 or less since it&#39;s not worth the full price of 50 dollars.&nbsp;</p>

"j_d","2020-04-06T18:36:01.7Z","Weird set","<p>This set features a 1967 Mini Cooper S Rally car, a Mini John Cooper Works Buggy, and a pit stop/garage kind of thing for working on the JCW&nbsp; buggy. The JCW buggy features working suspension, but the wheels aren&#39;t independent (the whole axle goes up and down). The cab is rather deep, too narrow and not shaped right. The S Rally is smaller than most speed champions cars, but it looks good. The mudflaps are made using butcher&#39;s knife pieces. There are two spare&nbsp;tires rubberbanded to the top. The new fender pieces for the S Rally look nice, but somehow they feel like peices from another brand like mega blocks or best lock. The pit stop setup has 2 tool chests, a gas can, a trophy stand, and 2 screens that show (on a sticker) &quot;live footage&quot; from the track. There is a lift assembly for the JCW Buggy, but you have to pick the car up and place it on the stands. The minifigs&nbsp;are a male photogapher, a male driver for the S Rally, a female mechanic for the JCW Buggy, and a female driver for the JCW Buggy.</p>
