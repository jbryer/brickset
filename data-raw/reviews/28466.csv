"Wendigo1","2019-11-21T02:07:13.66Z","Everyoneâ€™s a winner in this drag race","<p>Today&#39;s review is the outstanding&nbsp;75893-1: 2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon and 1970 Dodge Charger R/T. Two muscle cars race, but anyone who gets this set is the real winner.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures and scenery: Normally this is the weakest part of the Speed Champions series, but here&nbsp;it&#39;s a strength. The flag waving girl isn&#39;t too special, except for the long red ponytail hair piece that was used Mary Jane Watson previously. It&#39;s a nice relatively uncommon piece.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Charger driver has a nice jeans jacket torso with a modern Dodge emblem. His plain legs/helmet and&nbsp;common head are a let down but not unusual in this theme.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The real winner is the Challenger driver. She&#39;s in a nicely printed jumpsuit with lines running from the torso to the legs. The back has a really nice demon head printed in the center. It&#39;s really a sharp look for this figure and a welcome surprise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Track lights are the scenery in this set and the mechanism to start the race. It&#39;s really clever. The 6 orange lights and 2 green lights are attached to a Technic beam via long pins. There&#39;s a rod&nbsp;in the back with a Technic bracket that you slide down to force the lights up to simulate the countdown to the race. It&#39;s amazing how these pieces comes together to make a functional accessory to this set.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: There are two vehicles, the yellow 2018 Dodge Challenger and the black 1970 Charger. This set has numerous unique pieces, like 1x3 plate with an antistud on top and a&nbsp;2x3 black&nbsp;tile. Best of all are 1x1 tiles with printed &quot;R/T&quot; logos and 1x1 with a square and circular sides printed with the 2018&#39;s tail lights. I can&#39;t tell you how great it is to get printed pieces like that in a relatively cheap set like this, as Speed Champions are well known for their overabundance of stickers.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Challenger just looks amazing. There are only 4 exposed studs on the whole vehicle. The hood uses a spoiler raised just so slightly to simulate the air intake on the real vehicle. It&#39;s really a great look, with the only sticker for the front headlights looking just a bit derpy when compared to the rest of this sharp vehicle. The printed taillights look perfect and having them takes the major frustration out of applying stickers.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Charger was made to be modeled in LEGO. The boxy front end is an exact match for the source vehicle. The hood is all tiled and has an optional supercharger for that aggressive look. The rear quarterpanels are a great look. The angle of the tiles matches up exactly with how it looks on the real thing. The red stripe on the rear of the vehicle can be a bit of a pain, but well worth it for the overall look.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall: This is the hands-down best looking, most functional, enjoyable Speed Champions set I have ever built. I really can&#39;t find anything wrong with this set and am glad I grabbed this when I did. Both vehicles will make a great addition to my collection. Go out and add this set to yours.&nbsp;</p>

"j_d","2020-04-06T15:26:59.793Z","Great and not so great ","<p>This set features two cars and a christmas tree (that&#39;s what it is called). The christmas tree has a feature where you push down a piece on the back and the lights pop up. The Dodge Challenger SRT Demon is a rather simple&nbsp; build that isn&#39;t as&nbsp;accurate as it could be, for example, the headlights are just a sticker on a tile that makes it look too flat, the wheels are too narrow, and the overall shape is rather squarish. The Dodge charger, on the other hand, is nicely built and has a removable hood scoop assembly. There are 3 minifigs in this set, a male driver for the Charger, a female driver for the Challenger, and a female figure to wave the flag.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think the designer did a good job capturing the character of both vehicles in these six-stud wide vehicles. The midsections of both are built similarly with the major differences in how the front of rears are attached. Both cars also feature a pretty neat building technique where a 1 x 6 plate is secured in place from the <i>top </i>and is actually floating in place before that step. Really neat to see both vehicles mirror build patterns.</p>

<h3><b>2018 Dodge Challenger SRT Demon</b></h3>

<p>I love yellow and black scheme used here! I&#39;d define the Demon as being made of four modules; the main body, the front section, the rear section and the hood. The Demon&#39;s front and sections are attached via some technic side-construction methods. The pieces used to make the hood and scoop are another module that secure in place atop a 2 x 2 grey slope piece in the engine compartment.</p>

<p><br />
The front wheels are the standard tire-hub-rim combination featured on most of the Speed Champions. A nice touch is that overlarge rims that cover the side of rubber tires are used to replicate the Demon&#39;s drag radials. A very nice and appreciated detail! The Challenger&rsquo;s tail lights are actually prints and not stickers, which is appreciated!</p>

<h3><b>1970 Dodge Charger R/T</b></h3>

<p>In contrast to the Demon, I don&#39;t think the classic Charger can be easily broken up into modules. I&#39;ve tried poking around it and investigating some mods and it tends to kind of fall apart if too many pieces are removed from this configuration. The only part that is easy to remove is the massive air scoop (and the hood cover used to replace it).</p>

<p><br />
The front end is a fantastic reproduction of the source vehicle. The kit also impresses by having only 6 studs exposed on the final build.! The headlight and air-intake sit nestled in some pretty interesting studs-on-side construction to get the shaping correct. I really like that the Charger uses simple 1 x 1 round tiles as hub caps on the wheels.</p>

<h3><b>Side Build</b></h3>

<p>The overall theme of this double pack is a drag race between the new Challenger Demon and old school Charger. Appropriate then that the included side build is for a Christmas Tree!<br />
It&#39;s a fairly straight forward build process, but the included gimmick is pretty nice. Facing the drivers are a set of ten mounted lights that are free to rotate. The rear of the tree features a technic rod with a cross block on it to act as a plunger. By pushing the cross black down you are able to &quot;flick&quot; all ten lights up or &quot;on&quot;.</p>

<h2><b>Mini-figs</b></h2>

<h3><b>Flag Girl</b></h3>

<p>The non-driver figure is the Flag Girl. She has a very nice torso print of a grey hoodie and a maroon t-shirt underneath. The leg piece has no prints buts is molded in a color the evokes &quot;worn jeans&quot; which I appreciate very much. Her only face print sports a pair of aviators and her hair piece is a super long ponytail in red. The accessory is her titular checkered flag. A fine, nice and very generic figure.</p>

<h3><b>Challenger Driver</b></h3>

<p>This is our other nice, fine and very boring figure, the Challenger&#39;s Driver. The torso printing features a light blue jacket over a white Dodge t-shirt.</p>

<h3><b>Demon Charger Driver</b></h3>

<p>So here&#39;s the real star! The Demon driver is in a black race suit that features pink and white highlights. This is by far the most visually striking figure of the three!</p>

<h2><b>Conclusions&nbsp;</b></h2>

<p>Alright conclusions time! This is by far my favorite 2019 Speed Champions kit. This kit wins out almost entirely on the strength of the two vehicle builds. The side build adds some nice play features without taking up too many pieces and the three figures are also very nice. But the point of a Speed Champions kit is awesome Lego cars and by-gosh are these some awesome Lego cars!</p>

<p><br />
Both vehicles are very solid in the hand. There are minimal &quot;fiddly&quot; bits that get twisted around or knocked off during play. The builds straddle that line of not-too-complex for younger builders but not-super-boring for older ones. Repetition is also kept to minimum here, except for the Christmas Tree. For thirty bucks I think this is a must buy kit for anyone looking to pick up a LEGOs vehicles!</p>
