The value for money is in my opinion one of the best in the entire Lego line. Each car features a different accessory related to racing, a nice touch.</p>

<p>Its fun to put together so many tiny pieces into a complete car. It takes me about an hour, a perfect interlude in any busy schedule.</p>

<p>I&#39;m also much more of a collector/assembler, but the cars are some&nbsp;of the most playable Lego sets once built.</p>

<p>The stickers are one of the highlights, they really spruce up the finished project, but the car would look just fine without them.</p>

<p>If you are on the fence about these little gems, do yourself a favor and get one(which will almost certainly lead to several!).</p>

<p>Many people love this set and I understand why!</p>

<p>This set looks epic, but is not super accurate and has studs in odd places.</p>

<p>This set has too many frustrating stickers. I know it&#39;s expensive to make printed pieces, but 15&nbsp;stickers just seems too many for one car.&nbsp;And a windscreen is used upside down to form the sides under the actual windscreen, but you must apply stickers to the sides to make it look right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The front and back use cool techniques that use NEXO KNIGHTS axes and spear tips for the lights. This looks awesome. The color scheme is excellent also.</p>

<p>The price is perfect, and the minifigure has great printing and&nbsp;looks super cool. (The face print I received had a scratch through it, I just replaced it with one I had because it&#39;s not a special print.)</p>

<p>Not the most realistic set but if you don&#39;t mind lots of stickers it&#39;s great.</p>

"Zapp_Brannigan","2019-12-26T21:06:01.24Z","First Speed Champions Set","<p>This year my Christmas was highly minimalistic&nbsp;as, for the next few years, I&#39;ll be on a hiatus from major LEGO sets in order to save up enough money to get my own place. My budget for LEGO in the upcoming years will be $50 or less. With modulars and other Creator Expert sets now out of the question, I turned my attention to Speed Champions.</p>

<p>Almost all my knowledge of super cars is from playing Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit, otherwise it&#39;s very limited. The McLaren Senna drew my attention for one simple reason: it looked really cool. Of course, before buying any set, I need to read and watch reviews before deciding, because whatever I buy I want it to be worth the money. The Senna received praise across Brickset and LEGO Shop, so I knew that its &quot;cool appearance&quot; was most likely not a deception.</p>

<p>Build time was about 40 minutes for me without difficulties. For a non-Technic vehicular set, however, LEGO really outdid themselves with this one. Some of the building techniques are quite impressive, especially for a set of this size. While many other Speed Champions sets use stickers for the headlights, much to the distaste of many I&#39;m sure, trans-clear orange Nexo&nbsp;Knight pieces are used for the headlights here, as well as trans-red blade pieces for the tailights. The &quot;doors&quot; consist of a standard windscreen inverted using the SNOT techique. Both the front and rear grilles are highly detailed using various panels and cheese slopes. Numerous 1x2 sloped pieces provide the sleek look present in the source material. While every attempt was clearly made to minimize blockiness, exposed studs are still visible such as over the front wheel covers and the sides of the front bumpers, but this is LEGO after all so I have no problem with that.</p>

<p>In my opinion the proportions are good and reflect the <a href=""http://s1.1zoom.net/big7/469/McLaren_2018_Senna_Gray_background_Light_Blue_542194_2560x1795.jpg"">source material</a> quite well. The colour scheme of dark grey and orange work well for me. My only remark is that the front 1x2 wing pieces on the front bumper sides aren&#39;t flush with the car body as they stick out a little. There are close to 20 stickers in the set for logos and detailing too fine to be captured feasibly with normal pieces.The 6-stud wide setup of these cars mean that inherently they may be a bit narrower, but I&#39;ve got no issues with that. LEGO has announced 8-stud wide cars for the 2020 wave of Speed Champions.</p>

<p>Other stuff included are a driver minifigure, wind tunnel fan, wrench, and a second set of hub caps if you want to change the style.</p>

<p>At $20, Speed Champions sets have always been reasonable given the number of parts. The wind tunnel is certainly not necessary but as other reviewers have pointed out it may be used to satisfy a minimum parts quota. Otherwise it is well worth the money and the closest thing most of us will have to the real deal.</p>

"Lego_fan_","2020-01-10T02:51:16.98Z","A cheap way to get an expensive car","<p>Lego set #75892 is a great addition to any Speed champions or Lego city collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this car you can be the coolest Minifig in town.</p>

<p>This set contains one&nbsp;car, one driver Minigure, and a wind tunnel.</p>

<p>The Minifigure is very cool and has a Mclaren racing jacket on.</p>

<p>The wind tunnel is perfect for making sure your car is very aerodynamic and has a spinning fan.</p>

<p>The car itself is very cool and good looking. It has a movable fin, space for the driver, and can roll like any other car. It also has the option like most Speed champions sets for a different wheel set depending on what you like best. The car has some very cool building technics and uses of parts. For instace they use an upside down snowspeeder cockpit, Nexo knight weapons for head and tail lights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall i think this set has been fun to build and i think that any Lego city or Speed champions fan should get it.</p>

"East64","2019-06-11T16:44:22.517Z","Genius building techniques and very cool result","<p><b>Build</b></p>

<p>Where to even start with the&nbsp;build, this thing is unbelievable. The integration of the lights on the front and back, building out the cockpit, the rear wing, so much of this car comes together in ways that are so impressive. I would love to be a fly on the wall when the lego designer came up with this because the sleekness of the car would be very difficult to achieve without some of the creativity on display&nbsp;here. This was a real treat to build and set a new bar for me for small sets.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>A lot&nbsp;of the parts here will end up with stickers on them so no 5/5, but you do get a lot of slopes and interesting pieces in gray, plus some weird and unexpected parts used that I would never have obtained otherwise (if I ever take this apart, which I doubt I will).</p>

<p><strong>Extras</strong></p>

<p>The wind tunnel is pretty useless here without any other inclusions. If they wanted to make this like a testing lab you&#39;d need tracks for the car and some computer equipment at least, plus maybe a scientist to be measuring the airflow around the car or something, as it stands its superfluous. The minifig&#39;s outfit is excellent, really cool design and printing that matches how cool the vehicle is, they could have done more with the face though.</p>

<p><b>Finished Product</b></p>

<p>Wow! There&#39;s not much else to say, this is a sleek and sexy car that does justice to its sleek and sexy inspiration. The orange touches are bold and add a lot to the aesthetic, particularly on the rims. The sticker usage here is not excessive at all, a lot of pretty subtle designs actually on clear stickers that let the natural coloring and all the angles/slopes do most of the work. Whether or not you even like the McLaren this is just a very cool car that maximizes what lego is able to do in creating sleek design out of a fundamentally blocky system.</p>
