"Wendigo1","2019-11-11T01:36:04.95Z","Is that street legal?","<p>For my latest review, I have&nbsp;75891-1: Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 Race Car. Is this another track dweller that can&#39;t transition to the street? We&#39;ll find out.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigure and scenery: This comes with a standard Speed Champions minifigure: yellow head, plain legs, single color helmet, and custom torso. Lame. The non-car build is a quick fuel can, with a harpoon gun handle as the fuel spigot. I really like the clever use of the 2x4 round bricks and inverted 2x4&nbsp;round tile to make the can portion. Combined with the 1x1&nbsp;block with stud extra stud face as the fuel point on the vehicle is a great touch.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: This was a bit more intricate than I expected for a Speed Champions build, but it works really well to represent the Camaro. The rear assembly uses the tile lock in trick I&#39;ve seen on other Speed Champions sets. It really makes the back of the car very sturdy. Additionally, the build gives the car an aggressive angled appearance, with the rear tires seemingly lifting the back end up. It&#39;s a great optical illusion. The build has a clever build on the back slope of the passenger compartment, giving the appearance of a curve with straight pieces. Inside the compartment is a racing harness built with robot arms, handlebars and a plain rod. It&#39;s neat and functional, but I removed it and the brackets it attached to because I want that street look. I swapped out the fuel point with a regular 1x1 blue brick for this reason.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hood and front end is less successful. The hood itself just looks choppy and not aerodynamic at all. It&#39;s really an eyesore. I had to leave the splitter on as well because without it, the front end looks bad. Oh well.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other drawback to Speed Champions is the plethora of stickers. Ugh. I left almost all of them off, except for the front and rear light assemblies and badges. It&#39;s frustrating because the set has two printed tiles with &quot;Chevrolet&quot; on them. These other pieces could be printed too, but I&#39;m assuming financial reasons preclude that.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a solid Speed Champions set. Find it on sale and add it to your garage.&nbsp;</p>

"Timmy","2020-02-17T07:19:11.7Z","The Lone NASCAR","<p>This was a fun Little build the roll cage was an impressive addition.&nbsp; I really like the Speed Champions 6 stud wide series for its unique and well printed mini figures and build techniques.&nbsp; The side walls for the tyres are an awesome edition and really sets an aggressive stance for the vehicle.</p>

<p>The only con to this set was that it was the only one produced, perhaps if the stickers were on clear film it could&#39;ve been adapted to other colours.</p>

<p>That being said if you ever see this set still available grab it.</p>

"Green_Bricks","2020-10-06T20:35:23.12Z","Not the (speed) champion of the line, but a solid set nonetheless","<p>I own quite a few Speed Champions sets, but this one never particularly caught my attention, instead coming into my possession as an impulse buy; I got it for &pound;8.50 instead of the usual &pound;12.99, which I thought seemed a good deal. Still, I thought I should review this one, because I always tend to review sets that I think very highly of; maybe I could do with some mediocrity once in a while!</p>

<p><b>Building experience</b></p>

<p>As with all Speed Champions sets, bag 1 is&nbsp;fairly dull bulking up of the chasis, and bag 2 is constantly interrupted with fiddly stickers! The stickers were predominantly&nbsp;rectangular, so I was able to line them up with other straight lines to make them not look too wonky, but as always, a couple of slip ups are present, although luckily not too noticeable. Overall, I had a fine time building it, and I probably spent about an hour on it, so it was long enough to give me a break from things like homework and revision. However, if given the chance, I probably wouldn&#39;t want to build another one from scratch!</p>

<p><strong>Completed model</strong></p>

<p>The sets from this range usually look pretty sleek and aesthetically pleasing, and for the most part this one adheres to the rule. I&#39;m not a fan of the how the windows are blocky in shape towards the back, but I can&#39;t see how the designers would have done a much better job, and for the size of this detail, a rework would hardly be necessary. I just feel in general that there are many edges here that haven&#39;t been streamlined; lots of jagged corners and exposed studs make this one feel a bit off. Also, as always, when a detail is split into 2 different stickers, there is a distinctive and unfortunate line down the middle. Overall, I do feel like I&#39;m being a bit harsh on this set, and it looks fine on display, but it does feel like it was quite hastily thrown together, and lacks the premium feel of the McClaren Senna (I don&#39;t know if other people share this opinion, but to me that set is amazing, and&nbsp;my favourite 6 wide car that I own).</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>I sometimes wonder if anyone really pays attention to the figures in any of these sets! They&#39;re a nice touch, but I usually don&#39;t think about them when purchasing sets. The driver included here does come with nice back printing featuring the Chevrolet logo, but the torso is the only real part of note; his face is smiling, his helmet is blue, and his legs are white. If you are interested in minifigures, the refuelling tank might be of more interest to you; it comes with a harpoon gun, which could be very useful when included with the summer 2020 ocean subtheme from LEGO City!</p>

<p><strong>The 3 Ps</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>P</strong>rice - &pound;12.99 seems fair for a 198 piece; it&#39;s a bit more expensive than a LEGO City vehicle of a similar size, but it is definitely more detailed. No complaints here, and the &pound;8.50 I paid was even better</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong>layability - you can put the figure in the driver&#39;s seat and zoom him around at high speeds. That&#39;s all you can really demand for a set containing one car and one figure. The fuel tank also adds some extra possibilities for story telling. Something like a starting line or speed bumps might have been more useful for a young kid who wanted to set up a racetrack in the living room, but I have no idea what goes into designing these sets, so perhaps that would be too much to ask</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong>arts - you get a few nice parts in blue here, such as the 2x2 macaroni tiles, which only appear in 9 other&nbsp;sets, and the Speed Champions mudguards, which only appear in 3 other sets, all of which are retired. The printed tyres are nice too, although you don&#39;t get any additional accessories such as hubcaps and alternate spoilers that I&#39;ve seen in other sets. Probably not best suited to being a parts pack for the general MOC builder, but if you&#39;re after some specific blue part, this set might just do the trick for it&#39;s low price point</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>I&#39;m sure this set will look fine among my other LEGO cars, but I don&#39;t think&nbsp;it will stand out. If I hadn&#39;t seen it that day in Tesco, I doubt there would be a hole in my soul waiting for this set to fill it; I don&#39;t mind having it, I wouldn&#39;t have minded missing out. Buy it if you particularly like Chevrolet or&nbsp;the colour blue, but if you don&#39;t have this set and you want my honest advice, you&#39;re not missing out.</p>

<p>This was my 2nd build. I was to ambiguous with this one. It was a very hard build for me, but I was very proud when I finished. The stickers were by far the worst part. It took my forever to do that part. Overall I was very surprised with the detail of the car.&nbsp;</p>

"kapkap7","2020-04-14T20:26:32.063Z","Great build and fun playset!","<p>For $14.99, this is an excellent small yet complex build that any Lego fan will enjoy. The pros include a good price/part ratio, an awesome and fun build, and a good amount of playability. The cons include the need to apply dozens of stickers and the inclusion of some highly specialized&nbsp;parts that might be hard to use in mocs. Overall, this is one of, if not the best Speed Champions set and I would highly recommend buying one.</p>
