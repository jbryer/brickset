<p>The build here is pretty good, there&#39;s a lot of parts here for not that big of an end product so it ends up being very dense internally and some of the sections connect in very satisfying ways. You build up and create these steps and angles that then get filled in perfectly later in the build and it really comes together nicely</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>I could never give perfect marks to a sped champions set for parts because of all the&nbsp;stickers, though this set is relatively light on stickers relative to the rest of the line.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Value</b></p>

<p>The final car is pretty small given the part count, for those who have built speed champions in the past you know that they&#39;re only 6 studs wide, so I think the value here is not as great as the price/part ratio would imply. That doesn&#39;t mean its poor value though, you get a really nice build and a great finished product for pretty cheap.</p>

<p><b>Extra Additions</b></p>

<p>The minifig here is really cool looking with the&nbsp;Ferrari livery and he has a little masculine stubble which is a fun touch. The ability to swap out the nose, rims, headlights, and rear wing is ok, once I built it and figured out which specific arrangement I liked the most I doubt I will change to something I like less, but you&nbsp;still feel compelled to keep all those parts together so its not something I feel adds much to the set beyond the initial ability to choose the specific look that appeals most.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>If you&#39;re interested in Speed Champions, or just love the&nbsp;F40, this is not one to miss! Lego has replicated the look of the car at this scale with excellent fidelity, it just looks and feels great.</p>

"Wendigo1","2019-11-03T23:58:43.917Z","Fierce but bumpy","<p>So here&#39;s review 4, another Speed Champions, 75890 Ferrari F40&nbsp;Competizione. It&#39;s a modular set, customizeable in numerous ways. Does that make it worth it? Let&#39;s see.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigure and scenery: The minifigure is another Speed Champion standard. Logo on the torso, plain legs and a helmet. Meh. There&#39;s actually no scenery in this set. I&#39;ll cover that below.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: As every with Speed Champion, the build is fast and straightforward. There are too many studs exposed for my taste, especially for a high performance vehicle. Just throws off the aerodynamic vibe. The spoiler? Awful. Just makes the rear look too tall and out of place. The rear has a really neat build though. There&#39;s a clever use of a 2x4 tile to lock in the rear assembly by slipping that tile between layers in the build and not connecting. It&#39;s difficult to explain but genius in action. The best part of this build is the customizable hoods that you can swap out, though applying stickers is a hassle but expected in Speed Champions. There&#39;s a splitter that can be added or removed.&nbsp;The rear exhaust can be swapped out as well. It can have a racing or street legal look.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>So no scenery but a more customizeable car? I think it works here. Though I just totally removed the spoiler because it was so awful looking. This is a fun set because of how much you can really make it your own. I can say I&#39;d recommend this to anyone looking to add some life to the vehicles in their collections.&nbsp;</p>

"TeddytheSpoon","2020-11-16T20:00:29.623Z","The famous F40 sits firmly among the Speed Champions favourites","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The build: </b>this set features more interesting building techniques than many sets several times bigger than it. As with many Speed Champions sets, there is a myriad of SNOT work to create diffusers, floors, door insets and vents, all in an impressively small package. For those looking for an education on plate and half-plate offsets, this is a great place to start. Similarly, as with virtually all Speed Champions sets, there is a densely-populated sticker sheet for details &ndash; a necessary evil at this scale, and par for the course for this theme. Nevertheless, the extra detail they do add is worth the time added to the build process. <b>8/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The figures: </b>just the one, as is to be expected: a driver in a generic Ferrari-branded race suit. Truly great figures tend to be the exception rather than the norm for this theme, with the occasional driver in mufti, but he complements the car well enough. <b>7/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Play value: </b>technically, this set could be described as a two-in-one set, as parts are included to swap between the titular F40 Competizione and the road-going, &lsquo;regular&rsquo; F40 model. The bonnet, spoiler, wheel rims and headlights are all swapped and the diffuser removed to do so. While a nice feature, it does not add as much value as some other extras from other sets, such as a windtunnel or pitlane traffic lights. In isolation, the car is nice enough to drive around, although more fun will certainly be had racing alongside other vehicles. <b>6/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Model value: </b>the Speed Champions line can be slightly hit-and-miss with the looks of its cars, especially with some of the earlier models. The nature of the small scale limits how well the sleek lines of certain cars can be pulled off, something which early sets struggled with (I&rsquo;m looking at you, #75909 and #75878). However as the theme has progressed, not only have the models improved generally, but it has really hit its stride when dealing with older cars; perhaps it is their blockier nature, and the absence of the tiniest nooks and crannies used to extract performance that are present in present-day vehicles. Notable examples here include the Mini from #75894 and #75884 1968 Ford Mustang Fastback, despite the ungainly proportions of their minifigure pilots. #75890 certainly continues that trend &ndash; the F40 is instantly recognisable, and looks superb in both its road and race configurations, and anywhere in between. <b>9/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Overall verdict: </b>#75890 is a worthy addition to the Speed Champions line. The intriguing construction of the vehicle alone is worth the price of admission, and although the extras could have been better, the attractive rendition of this most iconic of supercars makes it frankly a steal at &pound;13. <b>8/10</b></p>
