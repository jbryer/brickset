<p>After a series of six stud wide light trucks (in Australia we would call it a ute), this is a return to an old school four stud wide City car.&nbsp; It is based on all the familiar City car pieces; the full length car base, SNOT pieces front and back, wheel arches (although the new squared ones), windscreen and roof piece.&nbsp; It is not too dissimilar to the car in the old 60012 set.&nbsp; We also get a kayak, a camera, a frog and a nice brick built kayak paddle.&nbsp; You also get an unremarkable minifig.&nbsp; The kayak is stored on the roof of the truck/ute, which seems and looks unrealistic.&nbsp; Why not a wagon/estate?&nbsp; There are six stickers, although arguably only the one for the rear numberplate is necessary or improves the appearance of the vehicle. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are looking for an inexpensive set that fits in with mountain/forest police sets or the outdoor adventure set then this fits in nicely.&nbsp; It is also another nondescript car and minifig to populate your Lego City city.&nbsp; It is the perfect gift for a child you don&#39;t really care about.&nbsp; In summary; okay, but nothing special.</p>

<br />
It is also nice to see the detail on the PFD compared to the ones from the previous city series, it looks more like a buoyancy aid (albeit without a back - but this is for practical reasons probably!) than a life jacker. So looks much better for a kayaker. It has nice detailing with the straps to secure it across the chest (and the central zip) as you would expect from a buoyancy aid.<br />
<br />
It would have been nice to have had helmet (Similar to the skater helmet) rather than the baseball cap - but it&#39;s perhaps designed for a more leisurely paddle than a white water experience!<br />
<br />
The vehicle with the kayak is a nice addition - fairly standard - but a nice selection of parts...</p>

"Faefrost","2019-02-04T05:22:39.3Z","A nice little City Vehicle","<p>Just a quick down and dirty review. This is a well worthwhile little City set. It basically gives you a small pickup truck, a new style Kayak in yellow, a minifig&nbsp;with new lifevest, a camera and a Frog.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a small build in an impulse set the truck is quite good. Having a few nice added details and parts. It has 4 of the new square&#39;ish shaped fenders. The new front pushbar piece, and it even includes some detail such as dual exhaust pipes. Well done for under 100 pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall it is always nice to have another civilian vehicle for our City streets. One that isn&#39;t a Fire truck Police Car or similar. Just something the normal citizens drive. This fits nicely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2018 surpassed all expectations I had for Lego sets throughout all themes. However, when I first looked at all sets from each theme for winter 2019, few sets really sparked my initial interest. This set, including Emmet&#39;s dream house and a couple Technic models were the only ones I was truly interested in. The compact nature of this model and its premise surrounding a little excursion to a river was what really sold me. All other City models seemed too generic this time around and had no impact on my emotional attachment to them. This model was the perfect $10 set for any Lego enthusiast.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What I enjoyed about this set:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>I absolutely adored the compactness of the model. I currently own a Ford Ranger, which is why I have an emotional attachment to smaller vehicles. This model depicts a person that is willing to travel a great distance to a remote location and enjoy their excursion with no other distractions. This mentality of living independently is one of my ideal traits and with which I absolutely&nbsp;commend Lego for including in this set. The truck is very robust and even boasts a little cargo area, which is not to common among many Lego built pickup trucks.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What I disliked about this set:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>This model presented a very basic building process with no real unique structural techniques depicted throughout. It seemed as though the designers were just using minute changes from previous models to incorporate in this new concept. It felt repetitious from earlier, more complex models form the past. I felt now sense of joy when constructing the model, only afterwards in the play stage did I encounter happiness from the details not noticed in the building process. The pieces did not seem to unique to the model and were all ones I could have pulled from my ever growing collection. I still enjoyed the model as a whole, but the process felt dull at times.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Would I recommend this set?</strong></h2>

<p>After much consideration about the building process and overall tone of the set, I would highly recommend this set to any City planner or adult that wants to buy this set for their younger children. It is the perfect $10 set and is very simple and flawless to build. It was not a strenuous process while building, but for an experienced builder like myself, presented no new techniques for model construction. The model fit perfectly in any town setting or wherever one may place it. This model embodies the tone for what is to come in 2019. Awesome start, Lego City Group!!!</p>
