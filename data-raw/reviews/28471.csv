"Faefrost","2019-02-04T05:30:19.19Z","A good little impulse buy set","<p>Just a quickie. This is a nice little impulse buy set. A very nicely shaped modern police car. The build is surprisingly good. Not quite up to the level of Speed Champions vehicles, but clearly drawing more from those wonderful designs than the more standard City fare. The car while not specific to any branding is easily recognizable as a modern police cruiser with some nice sloping curves to it. And some good touches such as grill lights, rear exhaust detailing and a rear window lightbar. It just all comes together and works as a model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifig? It&#39;s a Cop. A decent one with some nice printing. The accessories? You build 2 2piece traffic cones. So really the set is all about the car. And the car is about as perfect a modern police car as we could want in a 6 stud City rendition.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons: None</p>

<p>This vehicle is a wonderful&nbsp; addition to any City/Townscape and sense it is so cheap it can be bought in small bulk: 2-4</p>

<p>I hope this review was helpful, leave a like if you enjoyed it and feel free to check my collection.</p>

<p>The Lego City set 60239: Police Patrol Car is one of the 50 Lego City sets released in 2019. It went on sale in Europe on the 27th December 2018 for 9.99&euro;/ 9.99$. It contains 92 parts. This converts to 10.9 cents per piece. It&#39;s the first stand-alone city police patrol car since 2008. I think it&#39;s a much-needed upgrade and an essential set for a modern City display.</p>

<h2>The completed model</h2>

<p>I really like the shapes and the overall design of this nice little car. Yes, it doesn&#39;t even come near the level of detail of the vehicles featured in the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Speed-Champions"">Speed Champions</a>&nbsp;series, but it seems inspired from those designs and it is above most cars you find in the City sets. The 6 stud width is a great step towards more detailed, closer to reality vehicles in the City series and I&#39;m glad more and more vehicles are based on this design and not on the old 4 stud design.</p>

While I do not recognize if any real-world car model was used for inspiration, the car is easily recognizable as a modern, powerful and fast police cruiser with aggressive, sloping curves. Add to this the subtle details on the front grille, the rear exhaust and the lightbar that is the rear window and you get this model, that just seems to fit together very well.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>This set doesn&#39;t have much in terms of play value, our hero cop has no criminals to chase down and arrest. This set is really only about the cruiser. Kids will have fun smashing the traffic cones or combining this set with other City sets in a crazy police chase. Collectors may want to buy a few of these to modernize their police fleets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The low price makes this set a compelling option for anyone looking to expand their City, it can even be bought in bulk and is a cool gift for anyone.</p>

<p>I really like this set and it has my recommendation.&nbsp;</p>

"MartinT","2019-10-16T23:36:55.56Z","Police car with a hint of Speed Champions","<p><span style=""tab-stops:294.55pt"">I bought this car because it looks like a Speed Champions car.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Details</b></p>

<p><span style=""tab-stops:165.6pt"">The car has many nice details. </span></p>

<p>I liked that the car doesn&rsquo;t need any stickers to make up the details. The front and back are built with bricks only which is nice. The stickers are only there to tell that this is a police car. I did not apply the stickers for the license plate, because I will have the car next to a Speed Champions car which don&rsquo;t have license plate.</p>

<p>The rear wheels sit one plate higher than the front wheels. This makes the car front heavy and indicates a powerful engine.</p>

<p><span style=""tab-stops:188.4pt"">The inside of the car is also nice. With a steering wheel and a slope piece with print of two gauges on.</span></p>

<p><span style=""tab-stops:188.4pt"">The weakest part of this car is the roof. It is attached in all the four corners. This should make the roof solid, but it is not. If you pick up the car with only the roof, the rest of the car will get loose and fall. I think the problem is that the edge of the roof is a slope. This looks nice, but it makes the connection loose.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""tab-stops:188.4pt""><b>The minifigure</b></span></p>

<p><span style=""tab-stops:188.4pt"">The minifigure is good. He looks like the coolest policeman in the city, with the shade and cap.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Comparison with Speed Champions</b></p>

<p>I will compare the police car with the 1968 Ford Mustang Fastback, because this is the only Speed Champions car that I have built so far.</p>

<p><span style=""tab-stops:191.4pt"">The building experience is the same as the Ford Mustang Fastback, but much simpler and easier.</span></p>

<p>The police car is smaller than the Ford Mustang Fastback. The wheels is smaller, the height is lower and the length is shorter. The only similarity is the width, 6 studs wide. If you display the two car side by side it will look weird, but if you place the police car behind like its chasing the Ford Mustang Fastback, it looks good.</p>

<p>There is some Speed Champions car that is smaller than the Ford Mustang Fastback. They will look better next to the police car. Therefore, the only problem with the police car compare to the Speed Champions car, is the wheels. There are too small. If the police car had used the same wheel from Speed Champions car, it will be a Speed Champions car.</p>

<p>The conclusion from the comparison is that the police car looks and feels like a Speed Champions car. The only problem is the small tires.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>This car is close to a Speed Champions car. It looks amazing, but the wheels are too small and therefor the car is smaller.</p>

<p>I hope LEGO will make a police car in the Speed Champions line. Like a Dodge Charger police car.</p>

"tielenaar","2019-07-09T12:34:44.63Z","Good value set","<p>I bought this for my 4 year old, but luckily he let me build it together with him.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a very nice car, very low on the ground and drives smoothly. The design is wonderful with the rounded hood and the pieces don&#39;t fall off when&nbsp;you drive it into a wall.</p>

<p>The only downside I can think of is that it doesn&#39;t have doors that can open, but it&#39;s designed to take the roof off easily so you can place the minifig inside.</p>
