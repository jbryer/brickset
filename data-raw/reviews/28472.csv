"omnius","2019-03-21T20:33:07.957Z","Useful for any growing city","<p>This is a simple set, replacing the long-running road plate packs 7280/7281. The plates themselves haven&#39;t changed, but are packaged differently with this set consisting of crossroads and a curve, Thankfully, being the same plates as the earlier releases, they don&#39;t look out of place on an existing city scene (an issue that plagued previous roadplate &#39;refreshes&#39;). If you&#39;re not familiar with the earlier plates, they consist of road markings and in the place of the crossroad, pedestrian crossings.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t let the &#39;3&#39; for &#39;building experience&#39; fool you - this is because there is simply no building experience in this set, simply consisting of two plates that can be placed alongside each other. However, you can let your imagination run wild, especially with the curve having enough space to house a decent-sized building. Combined with the &#39;Xtra&#39; polybags and a couple of vehicles, you can quickly put together a lively scene. They score highly for playability on this basis.</p>

<p>Value-for-money wise, this pack is actually cheaper than it&#39;s predecessors, priced at &pound;9.99 in the UK.</p>

<p>Overall, this is great for anyone wanting to start a city, grow a city or just want somewhere realistic to display vehicles and minifigures - it&#39;s highly recommended!</p>
