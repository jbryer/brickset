<p>Everyone who reads my reviews should know by now, that I am a big fan of LEGO helicopters. As a result, I was very disappointed that the recent catalogue did not feature a single new big chopper! This set came closest to what I was looking for, so I waited for any kind of discount and got it.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some special parts to this set, since it is no ordinary helicopter. The rotor-&quot;cases&quot; were new parts to me, as were the new pilots breathing mask and the backpack-thing for the jetpack-guy. I also like the big, chunky tires of the truck!<br />
This set comes with a special light- and sound-brick. On pushing the button on it, the blue lights flash and a (very squeaky) siren goes off.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are four minifigures in this set, which is a good amount at this overall size. You get two police officers - a female driver and a male jetpack-pilot - and two crooks - a male pilot for the &quot;drone-copter&quot; and a female one to do the dirty work! Now that&#39;s equality!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A straightforward build, no big surprises here. Both the copter and the truck are quite simple, the complete build can be done in some 20 to 30 minutes without haste.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Both vehicles in this set have a very cool design. While the &quot;drone-copter&quot; is an interesting new approach to the whole helicopter-section by LEGO, it does lack any further functions. There is no winch, no hatch or cargo area that can be opened whatsoever. You can spin the blades, open the cockpit and let the grappling hook dangle from the back area (where you can put the female crook).<br />
The security truck turns out as expected, extremely bulky and sturdy. It has, at least, a hatch that can be opened in the back and a removable middle part where the grappling hook can latch on to steal the diamond cargo.<br />
The wingsuit/Jetpack-guy looks a little odd, but is a nice addition, since he can immediately initiate pursuit on the thieves.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While, to me, this set has quite good points in playability, design and the variety of parts, it is heavily limited by the lack of functions on both the main vehicles. Imaging myself as a kid at 6-8 years, I was always exited to open all the doors and hatches, flip switches, move hinges and so on. I guess it would be suitable for younger children, fitting in the same section (play-wise) as the new 4+ -sets&nbsp; from LEGO. An older child would surely get bored quickly, due to the limited discoveries you can have with this set.<br />
Also, the retail price of nearly 50&euro; is a joke! I mean come on, 50&euro; for a 400-pieces-non-branded set?? I got it for 40&euro;, which was still more than enough, and still I can&#39;t fully recommend this set, except for crazy collectors like me. So three stars is all I can give, even though the looks are quite cool.</p>
