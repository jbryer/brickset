"Faefrost","2019-02-04T05:06:47.067Z","Horribly Overpriced","<p>Up front, simply on the price/value scale this might be the years worst City set. It&#39;s a nice little helicopter. But at $29 usd? This should have been a $19 set. It has a PPP in excess of 15 cents/piece. And with nothing special such as a Dinosaur, big fig or special function to justify it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions - The box is standard city fare, even if the scenario is absurd. A crook using a 4 rotor drone to steal a massive gold colored statue, and being chased by the &quot;SKY POLICE!!!!&quot;&#39;s new Blue Thunderesque&nbsp;attack helicopter. With airborne net cannon. I think Lego City has entered into some sort of dystopian authoritarian future? It comes with 2 instruction books. Why? I have no idea. The first book builds the statue, the crook and the drone. You need about 2 pages to do this. Why print a full book? The second book is the helicopter.</p>

<p>Minifigs&nbsp;- The minifigs are decent.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Crook - A fairly standard crook. He is in dirty and rumpled&nbsp;prison stripes. Wearing a red wool cap. For some reason his head has a headset microphone printed on it. His accessory is a slightly brick built tablet remote for the drone. A sticker is the screen.</p>

<p>The Cop - OK he is kind of the star of the show. This isn&#39;t a cop. This is a fighter pilot in blue. He has front and back printed torso and printed legs depicting his official &quot;SKY POLICE!!!!&quot;tm Flight Suit. a new Accessory is his fighter pilots breathing mask and hose which goes around his neck and lower face. I&#39;m not sure why a helicopter pilot would need this? But hey it looks cool. He has a single sided serious expression, but no biggie as all you see are his eyes and eyebrows. He has a new Helmet with a movable trans clear Fighter Pilot style visor. A great figure.</p>

<p>The Statue - The statue is the sole reason many will want this set. To go alongside their Astronaut Statue and Historical Statue from other sets we get a Firefighter memorial Statue. This one in a Pearl Gold color and holding a pearly gold extinguisher. (Why an&nbsp;extinguisher? And axe would have looked better) he looks great and has a nice simple plinth that you build which has a stickere plaque on it. The only major complaint is the gold used for the helmet is not the same as the gold used for the rest of the figure. The plaque indicates a 1932 date, which matches nicely with the date on the Modular Fire Brigade.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts - Fairly Bog standard for a City set outside of the cops helmet and air hose. It uses two of the newer fenders in dark bley&nbsp;as engine cowlings. The only other thing of interest is the new style Net Cannon. It&#39;s honestly not that interesting. The old clunky ones worked much better. This, while more compact is pointless and unfun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Build/Model - You have the drone, which only a kid could love, and even then, not for long. You have the Plinth which is essentially 5 stacked round bricks. And you have the main build the Police Helicopter. It&#39;s a great little Helicopter. A nice reasonable size between the bigger full sets like the Air Ambulance, and those pointless tiny police helicopters that they put in every police station. It is sleek and swooshable. Very playworthy. It&#39;s main features are a swiveling spotlight on the right side (non lighted) and the new net launcher assembly on the left. It has enough detail to be noticed while being just small enough that it can be landed on the various Police Stations and Patrol Boats etc. It&#39;s a decent little helicopter... It&#39;s just not a $30 helicopter by any stretch of the imagination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overview - Worst City Set of the Year! Purely based on costs. The only element of value in this thing is the gold fireman statue. I suggest you just Bricklink it. This should be a $15 or $19 set. It would be great at those prices. At $30? Just leave it on the shelf. It&#39;s pure robbery.&nbsp;</p>

However, I am selling the set because I wasn&#39;t particularly pleased with it...here are the positives and negatives of this set:</p>

<p>POSITIVES:</p>

<p>- The minifigures are good quality and come with accessories for each of them.<br />
- The building process is fun with&nbsp;comprehensive instructions and enough parts to please both an AFOL and a&nbsp;KFOL.<br />
- The helicopter is a good solid structure and looked great upon completion.</p>

<p>NEGATIVES</p>

<p>- The net shooter is not a success. Whilst it does shoot the net, it only shoots a couple of inches and is pretty much a failure. You can&#39;t hold the helicopter in a way that makes it possible to aim the net shooter at the drone, meaning that the playability of this set is not great.<br />
- The drone is not a stable build, mostly because of the legs, which impede on its stability when it is placed on a flat surface. This means that it is not at all good for display purposes, but is fine for play purposes.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, there is much to be worked on, but it is still an &quot;ok&quot; set. Probably wouldn&#39;t recommend it though.</p>
