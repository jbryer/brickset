Unfortunately I think there's a glitch at the end of the game so if you've completed it; don't go back to the space station via the train. Pretty much everything in this looks like lego which wasn't even done with &quot;Lego Batman&quot; and once more, the minigames make an awesome game on their own.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
