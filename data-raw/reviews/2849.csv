"A_Brickset_user","2003-10-13T00:00:00Z","","Perfect.  If this island was an actual bricked-out set, it would definitely be the best LEGO set ever.  It is the perfect representation of what a LEGO town should be: small by our standards, but good-sized one by minifig standards, many great buildings, everybody is smiling, and there are hardly any problems.  Actually, if there was a set of LEGO Island(the Xtreme Stunts don't count), I'd like it to be from this original version, the best by far.  For the actual game, it's the best because it's more of a RPG and wandering game where you do random tasks and bask in the life of a LEGO minifig.  In the others, you're always going and doing.  Well, in this, sit back and prepare to be amazed.  If you don't have it, get it. One of the best LEGO ""sets"" ever.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

In this game, you get to explore the island that is your home.  You get to go inside buildings.  You get to build cars, buggies, jet skis.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-16T12:49:04Z","A classic from  LEGO Software range","Actually I don't own the new version I've got the old one from 1997, but they're both the same game. Well I got the 1997-version back in 1998, when I got my first computer.
It was only a Celeron 333, but great back then.
----------------------------------------------------------
Now to the game. I like this more then the sequel, because in terms of the world it has a classic style to it.
Altough in the Sequel are much more things to do I prefer this, for it's oldschool models. Ok the Graphics aren't that good, but hey it's an old game. The music is ok and I really like the Juke Box. Exspecially that country song &quot;Brick by Brick&quot; makes me love the game.
You can build some of the models, altough when playing not very much with it, it takes some time to figure out how to place the parts in the virtual models.
Well the buildings on the Island: I love them! 
They're classic town style from the mid 90s and even some are official sets like the Racetrack building, which is 6337's building or the Police HQ, which is the set 6598 from 1996.
And I wish lego would bring out some models out of this game like the houses or the supermarket and not to forget the restaurant and the hospital. They would get good sales. But otherrwise if you've got the bricks you can recreate them very good or restyle them with open backsides.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-14T17:13:45Z","If you only buy 1 LEGO game, get this one!!!!","   Actually, I own the origional version that came with the Infomaniac.  It runs on the new XP and the Notebooks, or on mine it did.  Yes!  This is the best game, it's like entering a LEGo world and you can be a minifig.  I still have the comic book that came with it, the third policeman's name is Captian C.D. Rom.  My favorite parts of this game were the animations, like the racetrack animations(lost couple in red car), the police animations(Nick Brick yanking the parrots, dogs, cats, and people out of the motorcycle), and Enter and Return(crazy medics-&quot;ca-a-n't go without the sh-a-a-rk!&quot;).  It's amazing, I've had it so long and I'm STILL finding new things!  
  So, having 'lived on the island' eight years, I've compiled a list of things for some one to look out for who plays the game the first time:

1. The elusive Talking Shark

2. The Most A Descartes' Incarnation Figure on the Island: Nubby Stevens' Philosophies.

3. The Treasure Chest

4. The Aquarium

5. The resident Island Pincushion: Mac Roni (dude with black shirt, grey arms, he gets all the bad luck)

6. The Medical Centre: Enter and Return (two identical medics who form a LEGO Abott and Costello)

7. The lost couple on the racetrack (this is actually a running gag)

8. Run Amuk Car and the Parrots(Especilly the Parrots)

9. Maggie Post's House (HINT click aroud as Pepper)

10. The Pirate Skellies ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

PROS
Customizable vehicles
There are 9 vehicles to ride,
Funny medics, Return and Enter. 
Lots of different people to talk with
good music
Several missions to go on
COnS
When clicking and dragging to build your vehicles, you have to click on a certain spot or you can not grab the peice you need

You can't walk on the grass
controls are too sharp
really thin paths
on the race course there is a huge dancing skeleton tha twill kick you off the course to an earlier section of the track

Notice the sign outside the bricksters cage that says, ""NO PIZAZ""??? Well, some idiot spelled pizza wrong, and if you give him one he'll get out, and try to take apart the city. And he'll steal the helicopter if you built it. Then you have to chase him around for a bit, and when you get the copter back you have to throw pizzas down on the road to slow him down,and you have to launch donuts to speed up the cops to catch him.

"Bricknave","2009-03-26T21:06:31.45Z","Good, but it NEEDS more.","LEGO Island, if you think about it, is pre-pre-pre-pre-LEGO Universe.  You can interact with characters, play games, and build things.  When you first start playing it; you have a blast of fun.  When you've done all of the activities ... Things get a little boring.

Pros:
Drag and drop customization of vehicles.
Customization of plants and the sky.
You can play as five different minifigs.
You can interact with characters.
Mini-games.
Brickster chasing adventure.
Music makes you feel all mellow inside.

Cons:
You can't jump, or walk on the grass!
The only thing you customize is just the paint job of the vehicle.  You drag and drop build, but you never arrange the bricks your own way.
You can not see your player when you're moving.
You have to walk up to the characters in a certain position.
You don't have access to all of the buildings.
Only five mini-games.
The giant dancing skeleton obstacle at the race track is a spirit breaker.

When this first came out, people who have never experienced more advanced video-PC games must have LOVED this.  Whether you want to buy this or save your money for something else is your choice.

My previous review is embarrassing because I realized something I should've done as soon as I got it on my computer: Virtual Machine, which runs Windows '98, the PERFECT operating system for Lego Island 1. Here are my thoughts on the now 100% working game:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>GAMEPLAY</h4>
<p>I love the expansive selection of vehicles and building challenges. I haven't actually played much, but I will.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>ANNOYING BITS</h4>
<p>The Infomaster needs to close his mouth at times, I wasn't born yesterday, I know that you ""enter your name and&nbsp;when you're&nbsp;finished&nbsp;click the green check mark"".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the gas station lady has some REALLY bad puns. :P</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>OVERALL</h4>
<p>An older game I just misunderstood. You could have lived during the time Windows '98 was actually being used, or have the highest-end Windows 7, you can still enjoy this wonderful game.</p>

"TurboJ","2012-06-15T07:37:00.867Z","The first and the best.","This game is without a doubt one of the best games Lego released. While very simple by today's standards, for its time it was incredible and it's still very fun to play.<br><br>The graphics are brilliant, although certain settings need to be changed in order to make the game run properly on a modern computer, otherwise the game will flicker. The new settings make the graphics a little more pixelated and greatly affect transparent objects, but it's a necessary sacrifice.<br>I love that numerous buildings in the game were based on existing Lego sets. I was always disappointed that I never owned the police station, and even moreso when I discovered the Information Centre wasn't available to buy. Of course, it's Lego, so it's possible to build all the buildings in real life.<br><br>Controls are nice and simple - arrow keys or mouse. Anyone can use them, although if you're playing on a modern PC, controlling with the arrow keys is very stiff. For smooth controls I recommend using the mouse as you can vary your speed and make subtle turns, unlike with the 'one-speed' arrow keys.<br><br>The music is brilliant. Every area of the island has a signature theme, all of which are very memorable. Personal favourites include the hospital, residential area and the jail.<br>The voice acting is pretty good too, and they actually got a few notable voice actors, such as June Foray as Mama Brickolini and John Morris (aka Andy from Toy Story) as Pepper.<br><br>The gameplay is very open-ended. Once you've chosen your character, you're given complete freedom of the island provided you stick to the paths and roads. While some may complain about this, really, what are you missing by not being able to walk on the grass? The mission-based nature of the game can be seen as overly simplistic, and unless you're a first-timer they can be completed with ease, but they're entertaining. The pizza missions are fun, and Pepper's mission is pretty much the plot of the game. The races are always fun, but a skilled player will easily win each time. The vehicle missions (ambulance and tow truck) are the same for every character, and can be a little repetitive, but there is a key element that saves them.<br><br>The writing.<br><br>The main reason this game still holds up is because of how well it's written. There's something in this for everyone. The game doesn't take itself seriously, so the characters are well aware what Lego is and that they can be taken apart. Crash into someone while driving? They comically fall to pieces, then reassemble themselves. Papa Brickolini mentions they don't have knees, and the Brickster claims Nick's nonexistent shoelaces are untied. Among this are various visual puns, some excellent humour from the Brickster (combined with David Lander's portrayal of him, it's hilarious) and even a few references that children aren't going to get (eg The Beatles).<br>All of the characters are memorable, either through their personalities or their actions. Everyone remembers Enter and Return's constant bickering, and The Brickster trying to convince you to let him out. Even the most minor of characters is memorable in some way.<br><br>One other thing to bring up is the instruction manual, which apart from being helpful, contains several short comic strips showing a player becoming Pepper, saving the island from The Brickster, and the Infomaniac revealing the history of the island. It even has advertisements for the various businesses on the island, and in a group photo it reveals the names of ALL the island's inhabitants. Details like this only make me love the game even more.<br><br>To sum up, this is an amazing game. It's still very enjoyable, and I highly recommend that you have it in your collection. Just keep in mind that the game is 15 years old and has minor compatibility issues with modern computers.<br>",TRUE,5,3,3,5,5

I was a little bugged by the lack of movement meaning being unable to swim, walk on grass or beach, or jump unlike the other LEGO Island 2 and Island Xtreme Stunts. Well for the actual play experience: You start in the Infomaniac's information center and sign in as your name. Next, you select the character you want to be. The options are: Pepper, Papa Brickolini, Mama Brickolini, Nick Brick, or Laura Brick. I chose Pepper the first time I played. Now the fun begins, you exit the information center and are free to roam the Island (provided you don't swim or walk on grass). The real plot starts when you play as Pepper and deliver a pizza to the Brickster after you build a helicopter. This is a review not a spoiler though so I won't say what happens next. You'll have to play it yourself. Oh, the real end of the game is when you do every possible race, build, and pizza delivery with every possible character. Not as hard as it sounds though.
