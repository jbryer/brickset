<p><strong>Model</strong> in this set is a small box in the shape of heart, built based on 6x6&nbsp;plate. On the top there is a tile with name of one of character (Stephanie in this case) and some studs. Box looks ok, is built really simply, just some bricks stacked up. We also get two clear slopes attached to 2x4 plate, which can be used to make the box stay on its own.</p>

<p>Main idea of this line of sets is to collect minidolls&nbsp;with some equipment, put them into a box and stack those box one on another. Okay, I don&#39;t criticize&nbsp;this idea, for me this set doesn&#39;t have any sense. There are some good things in here, especially parts - eight quater-round plates and some rounded bricks. Colors are good - light and dark blue (azure, navy), and for sure the most useful of whole line. Equipment is kinda nice too - we get mp3, pizza, tennis rocket and championship cup. Nice choice, but could be much better.</p>

<p><strong>Stephanie</strong> in the new version don&#39;t look so good. For me she is much older than the rest of girls, which isn&#39;t good. She has strong make up, some sleeveless&nbsp;jacket and short skirt. Long blonde hair hasn&#39;t changed since the beginning&nbsp;and are great.</p>

<p><strong>Shortly summing up</strong>, weird set, totally useless, parts are good, accessory aren&#39;t, doll is not great, but not bad.</p>
