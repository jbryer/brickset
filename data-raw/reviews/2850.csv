It could be used to build various vehicles and houses (the set includes instructions for approximately 7 cars, 4 airplanes, 3 houses, 2 ships, a bunch of animals, and even a working windmill with a house and a truck). With the two minifigs the set can be used as part of a lego town. The wind up motor even allows motorized constructions that can't run out of battery. Many models in this set were later used by lego as a basis for town sets, most notably the tow and fire truck.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
