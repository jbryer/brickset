"jason1976","2019-05-13T20:55:51.08Z","Very good, but could have been a little better","<p>If I&#39;m honest, I only purchased this set for parts as I was able to get it for &pound;12.50 (50% off RRP) from Amazon (thanks Huwbot!), but once it arrived I couldn&#39;t resist building it and was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p><strong>Minfigures:</strong></p>

<p>The set comes with 2 mini figures, a man with a two faced head (scared and a grin) and a girl. Nothing special here really, but nice mini figures to have to add to your own MOC.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The set contains nearly 400 parts, while a lot are smaller parts there are some larger plates and bricks including some more specialised parts, all of which will be useful for MOCs. Despite two of the three builds being boats, all the hulls are brick built, there are no large hull parts included.</p>

<p><strong>Build 1 - the house boat:</strong></p>

<p>The main build is the houseboat, a couple of birds and a crocodile - it uses nearly every part in the set except the windscreen and a few 1x1 tiles and other small parts included as spares. It&#39;s an enjoyable build, and the houseboat is very detailed with lots of little features added by the designer.</p>

<p>For me however the two birds are the highlight of the build, and show what can be down with a few simple parts. I wasn&#39;t a fan of the crocodile though, it is a bit out of scale for the build, but I think children will like building and playing with it, which really is the point of the set!</p>

<p><strong>Build 2 - the seaplane:</strong></p>

<p>The second build is a seaplane with a viewing platform, and a crab. I didn&#39;t think much of the plane from the pictures, but it was a fun build with ingenious use of parts and I ended up liking the plane so much I rebuilt it after building the third build. The plane is very swooshable and does look like a real life seaplane and is a good example of how parts from one set can be used to build something else, and will hopefully inspire a new generation of young builders to put the instructions aside..</p>

<p>There is the usual criticism of colour mismatches that you get due to the parts available in a 3 in 1 set, but this wasn&#39;t a major issue in this build.</p>

<p>The platform is nice too, but could have been bigger, especially as there are a large number of parts left over that could have been used to make something bigger. Hopefully, this was intended to encourage children to modify the build and add to it.</p>

<p>A crab completes this build, I cannot say I was a big fan of this, but again I think children will like it.</p>

<p><strong>Build 3 - boat and building:</strong></p>

<p>The third and final build is a small boat and some sort of riverside building - I&#39;m not sure if it was meant to be a shop, a restaurant or something else. While it was still a nice model, this was my least favourite build and suffers from the flaws of the second build - a lot of parts left over (but more pieces to modify the build with), the colours of parts used not matching etc.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>This is a very nice set, and I think any child (or AFOL) would be pleased to get it, whether for the build or the parts. It is worth the RRP but if you can get it at a good discount like I did then you should snap it up.</p>

<p>The only criticisms I will give are the weakness of the third build, and that part and colour selection by the designer could have been improved a little.</p>

<p>For example, an additional <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6036503/profile-brick-%C3%B815-83-w-cross"">6036503</a> would have increased building options at very little additional cost, and the 4 x <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4243824/plate-4x4"">4243824</a> in brick yellow could have matched the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4570111/plate-8x8"">4570111</a> in sand yellow or vice versa, but these are minor quibbles and this set is recommended by me!</p>

"one79","2021-05-08T15:39:26.85Z","Having Fun in the Bayou","<p>Another set from LEGO&reg; Creator 3 in 1 series with outdoor theme that will be interesting for you to collect or place in your LEGO&reg; city diorama. The LEGO&reg; 31093 Riverside Houseboat set has a primary build as a small boathouse which is used by a father and daughter for fishing. The father minifigure has dual expression which is the shocked expression and relaxed smile expression while the daughter minifigure has only a single expression.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/t/5fe76c7b8e6d4012c8ba4651/1609002121239/LEGO+31093+%286%29.jpg?format=1000w"" style=""width: 650px; height: 488px;"" /></p>

<p>As you can see, this LEGO&reg; set has various of wildlife to enliven the playing experience. Starting from a couple of fishes, a small bird, a pelican and a big alligator. The alligator looks fierce with its big teeth.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/603e46f0594323390c9016f9/603e46f12e6568229d04c073/1614694155614/LEGO+31093+%282%29.jpg?format=1000w"" style=""width: 650px; height: 488px;"" /></p>

<p>The boathouse on this set is very safe thanks to three live preservers so when your minifigure fall overboard, your minifigure will not drown and become gator&rsquo;s food.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/603e47b60be61e307af26ba4/603e47b80d14784990ae0053/1614694356067/LEGO+31093+%283%29.jpg?format=1000w"" style=""width: 650px; height: 488px;"" /></p>

<p>The exterior of this houseboat is equipped with various decoration and furniture starting from chair, funnel flag, spotlight at the front side of the boat, lamps, decorative plants and ladder that function if you want to go down to the river or climb up to the boat.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/t/6019740b54023d49ce733545/1612280938560/LEGO+31093+%281%29.jpg?format=1000w"" style=""width: 650px; height: 488px;"" /></p>

<p>The interior of the houseboat has sufficient furniture. There is a chair, steering wheel, simple bed, television, wall lamp, sink, drawers and mug. It seems enough for the father and daughter. Overall the author think this boat is too wide and does not feel like a boat. This set can be combined with other outdoor set such as <a href=""https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-set-review-31098-outback-cabin"" tabindex=""0"">Creator 3 in 1 Outback Cabin - 31098</a> set for example.</p>

<p>Like the usual LEGO&reg; Creator 3 in 1 set, there are two more models that can be constructed from this set, but for this review, I only built the main model because it is the most interesting and use the most part. What do you think of this set? Leave us your comment below!</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>An interesting LEGO Creator 3 in 1 set that is not a building. This set add variety in the Creator 3 in 1 line and will be interesting to be included in any LEGO city diorama.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Sufficient parts for the build. I just wish the boat can be longer.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>It will be fun to play with this set especially with the brick-build alligator, pelican and bird. It will be a nice touch for any river or swamp with open water scene as well.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>This is a great set for its price. If you are patient, get it when there is a sale or discount.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note that I write this review based on my own LEGO Blog article which is available from:&nbsp;<a href=""https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-set-review-31093-riverside-houseboat"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab."">https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-set-review-31093-riverside-houseboat</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this insight from me will be useful for all AFOLs out there!</p>
