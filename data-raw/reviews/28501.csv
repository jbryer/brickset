<p>I have it hanging fom an air vent in my bedroom and it is interesting to watch while the a/c unit is on.</p>

<p>The main build kind of looks like a military helicopter.</p>

<p>There is not much to say about&nbsp;this set in a bad way because it is a great set for display and play.&nbsp;</p>

But the design of the helicopter is obviously from a military gunship, and the bright colour scheme does not help. It has aggressive shape, big for its size engines on the sides, winglets that are usually used for mounting armaments, retractable wheels instead of something like landing bars, a small cab for 1 or 2 pilots with no space for adventures, and the cab looks armoured on the sides. It definitely does not look fitting for neither a personal flight-for-fun (like something like 2-seat Robinson), nor for taking some adventurers to jump with a parachute or be dropped off at the top of a mountain to ski or snowboard down (like Bell 200 series). The only &quot;adventure&quot; I can think of for this helicopter is &quot;shooting rockets at tanks&quot;.</p>

<p>Continuing on the term of looks, it looks not great. The main rotor feels incomplete, and the tail is a total mess. Huge tail-end blocks the air for a half of undersized tail rotor, and with weirdly attached retractable landing wheel it looks just ugly. Structurally, the main build is not great. Some parts, like winglets or main rotor are pretty wonky and can easily break or come off. The rear landing wheel barely can hold the heavy rear-end. The only good thing I can find is the angled connection of the front, it looks decently and holds well.</p>

<p>The boat actually looks better, I can even say it looks cool, but the propeller placement is weird. The airplane (glider?) is so basic there&#39;s nothing to write about. Overall, I think this is misnamed set that is not worth it neither as a toy, nor for parts, nor for building experience.</p>
