Summarizing all Paris is most famous for, this set is nothing less than perfection!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This set makes great use of various building techniques, especially shown in the building of the Grand Palais. Speaking of which, the building comes out well-done and with grand detail. To its left lie the Champs Elysees, sparking the bit of color this set has to offer. They also make use of window-techniques and printed windows, leaving with an accurate depiction of the grand buildings. To the far left of the set is the fairly small (and understandably so) Arc de Triomphe. Defiantly not a lack to the set, but fairly a weaker point from it&#39;s pure take in size, yet still feeling presented decently.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So, as we begin to wrap up the smaller buildings with the Louvre! Defiantly a largely recognizable and iconic part of not just Paris, but the entirety of France. It is perfectly shown in mini-lego form, blending techniques and a grand appearance. We now transition to the Tour Montparnasse. Once again, a picture-perfect lego-description of another iconic building. However, it&#39;s shadowed by the star of the set - the Eiffel Tower. A slightly-shrunk version of the old 2014 set (which I ironically own) is absolutely <strong>perfect</strong>. Pieces and techniques, I legitimately cannot express opinion within text for my desire to this Eiffel Tower.</p>
