I never paid much attention to the skyline sets but was gifted the San Francisco model and immediately fell in love with the line. I am now making it my mission to obtain all skyline sets to date because of this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While SF certainly has its problems, the beautiful skyline and timeless facade of the city cannot be considered mediocre. This set greatly captures all the fine details of SF that make it a classic American city and tourist destination. I&#39;ve been there a couple of times and I truly feel the views of SF are captured here.</p>

<p>The Golden Gate Bridge is an obvious attraction and one that makes this set stand out from the others.</p>

<p>Alcatraz Island is one that&#39;s forgotten by some but is a major staple of California culture. I&#39;ve toured the prison in person so to see this included in the set was a major plus.</p>

<p>Of course the iconic profiles of 555 California Street, the Transamerica Pyramid, and the Salesforce Tower that govern the landscape are not missed in this set. Even Coit Tower is captured well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think my favourite aspects of this set, however, are the Painted Ladies - the colourful row houses that immortalised the city at the premiere of the American sitcom&nbsp;<em>Full House</em>. If you look closely in the street behind the Painted Ladies, small smooth pieces stick out from the street. I was confused at what those were supposed to be, but upon further inspection, found them to be trolley cars. A really great, tiny detail that gives this set so much more depth.</p>

<p>All in all, San Francisco is a must-have for any tourist, lover of American cities, and collector of Lego Architecture sets. The set has plenty of detail, offers a great building experience, and looks great on the shelf. It&#39;s also currently the only skyline model from California, although I predict a Los Angeles model sometime in the future. This one has been around for a while, so I would definitely cop one before they&#39;re gone.</p>

<p>I like these small skyline models for the interesting representations of recognisable landmarks, and I own those representing locations meaningful to me. this is one such set.</p>

<p>The build is nice, with some interesting techniques. Some parts of the construction had me thinking as I went as to how it would develop, keeping me guessing as to how it would turn out. With the mix of techniques and buildings, there is plenty to keep up interest, even with only a short build (about 1.5 leisurely hours); the building itself was enough to make me slow down and enjoy the process.</p>

<p>There are some nice parts in here especially the prints, sufficiently so for me to buy up some spares on Bricks &#39;n&#39; Pieces for MoCs. There is some evidence of commercial parts optimisation - in particular I intend to replace out some black parts in the base structure for blue as the black is a bit incongruous under the transparent representation of water. But that&#39;s a minor niggle.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t really score a model clearly intended for display on its playability, but as a display piece it looks great. In particular, the false perspective of the Golden Gate Bridge looks particularly good when viewed from a slight distance - some thought has been applied in the design to viewing distance when this is on display.</p>

<p>The architecture sets can seem a little pricey, particularly with a lot of small parts, but as this is a model I&#39;ll keep on long-term display, I find it&#39;s better value for it.</p>
