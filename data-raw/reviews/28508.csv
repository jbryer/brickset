<p>You can make so many stories with the fire fighters running to put out fires and rescuing people, or even just working in the station and eat their pizza.</p>

<p>The parts are versatile. You could combine the door, window, and bricks with pieces from other sets and build a house for your Duplo people. The dalmatian dog is just adorable.</p>

<p>The lights on the fire engine show the LEGO designer touch for details. They light up in blue and red and make sounds, but they are not loud like so many other fire truck toys. If your children are like mine you&#39;ll hear them all day long, so the fact that they&#39;re not ear piercing is very welcome :)</p>

<p>Without a doubt the best Duplo set I bought him so far.</p>
