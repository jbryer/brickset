You travel to different islands to track down the Brickster who escaped from jail AGAIN. Islands other than the main one, LEGO Island include Castle and Adventurers isles. You play differnt subgames like jousts, races agianst time, freeing dinosaurs, whacka snake, and so on.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Bricknave","2009-03-18T18:19:36.31Z","Mini-game adventure","In the first LEGO Island game; you cruise around building pre-made things, customizing things and playing mini-games whenever you felt like it.  This has a lot more action and adventure than the previous one.

Pros:
Better graphics!
Better music!
You see your character in front of you instead of through the eye-view thing!
Better controls!
Chatting with characters is better!
Awesome mini-games!
You can visit different areas based on different LEGO themes!
Collectibles that give you points
You can customize hats, vehicles and scenery!

Cons:
You can't build anything.
You can't get to where Johnny Thunder is when you revisit Adventurers island.
Not a lot of things to do after you beat the game, except discover the secret of the cave near the space port ....

4/5

"KLOKRIECHER","2012-04-27T09:09:53.43Z","LEGO Gear (Video Games/PC) - LEGO Island 2 Review","<div class=""description""><p>This is the second LEGO Island videogame which is a really cool game to have. The new island 
looks much cooler than in the first part and the game has lot's of little games in it, too. What I also like about this game is that some of the missions are not only on LEGO Island. There're also some missions which includes themes like Adventurers and Castle (Knights' Kingdom I). However: The final world is the Ogel Island but it's not based on the Alpha Team theme.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Lot's of cool games<br></li><li>New layout of the island<br></li><li>Missions includes themes like Adventurers and Castle (Knights' Kingdom I)<br></li><li>Cool Music<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>There're some buildings in this game which LEGO never produced as a set<br></li></ul>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all it's a great game to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.</p></div>",TRUE,5,1,5,5,5
