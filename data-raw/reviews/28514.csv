And, indeed, 10886 is very similar to 10816 and just as good. The concept of mixing and matching car bases, bodies, and accessories in three simple steps to produce an endless variety of vehicles (cars, trucks, busses, emergency vehicles, construction vehicles, and others) is brilliant. No wonder this one is a favourite with the little ones.</p>

<p>My daughter loves throwing together vehicles with minimal effort and then buzzing them around. This is just perfect for her age (1.5 years). We are impressed how smooth the modern stylised car bases glide along the floor compared to the longer classic ones with the red wheels (even if they cannot be chained as a flexing train). The parts and colors selection in this set is just perfect. Also the box presentation with the transparent window is very attractive for both adults and kids. The suggested vehicles on the box (no less than 16 of them) all look great and are different from each other.</p>

<p>This is what a great basic LEGO/Duplo set should be all about. Nicely done, Duplo!</p>
