The part I like is flicking pizzas at the brickster bots. But I don't think you can use the analog sticks in this. :D",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-21T04:49:40.483Z","Pizza's here!","I had tihs game a few years back and this was my first RPG styled game! And it's Legos! The opening cutscene was great! It shows a rocket, then the island, then a roadster which looked suspiciously like the 5920 Island Racer vehicle from the Adventurers theme, and then showing Brickster in jail with eyes that tranformed into pizzas so hot that it burned the jailbars, starting his bid for freedom. In this game, you are supposed to run errands and for each successful errand completed you get a brick added to your lot which expands your home. Your house is not built brick-by-brick as traditionally built houses, but rather each time you earn a brick your house upsizes into a bigger one.

You get to drive vehicles on the island and I remember driving the Island Hopper-like vehicle as I mentioned above, a delivery truck, and a helicopter. There is also a 6479 Res-Q Emergency Response Center near the beach and you can drive 2 Res-Q vehicles there. There is a speedboat which comes with the Emergency Response Center set and also the 6415 Res-Q Jet Ski. If you hop onto these boats into the wide oceans, you will eventually reach into a portal which brings you to Medieval Legoland. On top of the highest point on the Island is a base which looks like the 6339 Shuttle Launch Pad including the rocket.

If you own a PlayStation you might want to get this game on eBay as it is Lego's early ventures into RPG themes. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
