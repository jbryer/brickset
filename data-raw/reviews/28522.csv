"Mr__Thrawn","2020-11-29T01:32:38.8Z","High Quality Disc, Mediocre Film","<p><em>The LEGO Ninjago Movie&nbsp;</em>was LEGO&#39;s third theatrical feature film, released in 2017. It proved less successful critically and commercially than was hoped, contributing to WB&#39;s decision to stop producing LEGO movies. The film itself isn&#39;t terrible- the production value is high, and it&#39;s visually stunning. The synthesis of LEGO and natural environments is flawless, the score is fitting, and the vocal performances are all at least average. The fight choreography is also interesting- it was supervised by star Jackie Chan. &nbsp;However, the film lacks the heart,&nbsp;originality, and brand recognition&nbsp;that made the first two LEGO movies such massive successes.</p>

<p>The Blu-Ray itself is very well-made, with a clear image and immersive sound. The extras are fine- I particularly liked the 2D animated short and the commentary is decent. $40 is a bit much for this, but the RRP is closer to $10 at this point. It&#39;s worth picking up to add to your LEGO movie collection, but not too special overall.</p>

However the film is perfectly harmless and delivers what it sets out to do and while at first I felt a bit uncertain about the film I still believe it is a worthy addition to The LEGO Movie universe. Now let&rsquo;s discuss everything concerning this blu-ray release.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Presentation</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The menus are very nicely done for this Blu-Ray release featuring a nice design. The film case itself is also fairly well put together with nice imagery on the back and front of the case. There&rsquo;s a nice selection of bonus features as well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This film was not released with any unique polybags or characters unfortunately.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Contents</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is the third theatrical release for LEGO and the film itself is a bit repetitive in the story, this is mostly because it is following a plotline from LEGO Ninjago&rsquo;s television series in a slightly altered method. Basically I found this film to be the weakest offering at the time of its release, but after repeated viewings I can still see the merits of it. The animation is quite breathtaking and the look of NINJAGO City inside the film&rsquo;s world is very fun to travel through, a shame they didn&rsquo;t include any virtual tours of the city in the bonus features.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Speaking of which we have a few making of featurettes and the short that was released during the promotional run of the film. We also get to see what the new season will look like as part of the first episode of the new season is included to watch. It is unfortunate they didn&rsquo;t include the entire episode, as that would have been nice to see.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The LEGO Ninjago Movie is a fine outing for fans, others may find it to be a bit flat in comparison to the LEGO Movie or The LEGO Batman movie, the Blu-Ray release continues to deliver on all the special features and fun additional content you come to expect from these releases. I believe it&rsquo;s a worthy addition if you&rsquo;re a fan and I would strongly recommend it to fans of the LEGO Ninjago theme.</p>
