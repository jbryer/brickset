<p>Without any shame, this set is aimed for kids in a 6-12 years age&nbsp;with a great value for collectionists. Ocean Master and the new-for-2019 Aquaman&nbsp;are&nbsp;great additions to the DC Super Heroes collection, even though we&#39;re getting the same Batman minifigure we got in 76097 Lex Luthor Mech Takedown and 76111 Brother Eye Takedown except for the face print which is the same that&nbsp;came out in the early DC Super Heroes sets.</p>

<p>The package of this set does not longer have the &quot;DC Super Heroes&quot; advertising; it&#39;s now called LEGO DC Batman, according to an Italian catalogue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Two exclusive minifigs and a brand new Batvehicle, those are the highlights of this set. It&#39;s a pretty good set (for both kids and adults) at a fair price.</p>

"losinglemo","2019-03-18T12:45:57.91Z","Finally another Aquaman villain.","<p>A cheap and affordable set sporting 3 currently unique figures and an interesting vehicle design.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>A cool updated&nbsp;design of Aquaman based off his new comic look. This a refreshing take on a usually laughable character bringing him more inline with his&nbsp;modern iteration as well as his live action Mamoa counterpart. The new face print and torso are a welcome addition but it would have been nice&nbsp;to get&nbsp;some new printed design&nbsp;for the legs much like the Jason Mamoa figure.</p>

<p>A very standard Batman in his 2018 design with additional flipper and rebreather accessory to prepare him for underwater exploration. Much better underwater design in previous set 76010.</p>

<p>A very cool Orm/Ocean Master release to tie in with the live action film. A much needed addition to the very scarce release of DC villains outside of the Batman series. Sporting a new torso and face print with a sweet&nbsp;recolour of the Atlantian&nbsp;helmet from set 76085.&nbsp;Again a shame the leg piece is missing any detail but overall im just happy to get a new Aquaman&nbsp;villain in minifigure form.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set itself is nothing super special. However the Batsub&nbsp;is an interesting deep sea explorer design not previously released. Play functions are limited with stud blasters, barely movable grabby claws, opening and closing cock pit and spinnable&nbsp;propellors. While the sets functions are very basic, the price RRP is a great deal, for 2 really interesting minifigures, 1 ok minifigure and a bat-vehicle design currently unique to this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The water blast accessories also add an interesting touch and add even more opportunity for play and imagination&nbsp;as well as a snappy shark. Above average set for a great RRP therefore I&nbsp;reccomend.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-13T19:07:32.97Z","New Elements and Warriors of the Deep.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #76116 Batman Batsub and the Underwater Clash: </b>Is it my imagination or are DC Super Hero sets getting longer and longer names? The 2019 DC sets are all based around Batman, so LEGO decided it was the perfect time to change the design of the packaging completely while also introducing the DC building fans to the new energy elements.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As noted in the intro packaging has been changed. Gone is the standard blue colour scheme replaced with a black box colour with the Bat logo in the upper corner, the DC logo in the lower corner near the Minifigure call out and LEGO Batman peeking in from the side.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">You still see the set in all its glory on the front and back, a very nice action shot is shown on the front with some of the energy elements being displayed, while the back shows off even more of what you can do with these parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual design hasn&rsquo;t changed much, although even in DC land LEGO Life is now being advertised on the front cover, there&rsquo;s a small blurb in the bottom, a circular design with a QR code. I suppose this is the new thing going forward. Rounding out the contents here is a Sticker sheet for the added details on the vehicle.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The energy elements play a large role with many of the Super Heroes Theme sets these days. They are the most unique offerings from this set as everything else is common, you&rsquo;ve got your bat wing fin elements, your bubble cockpit window, bricks, plates and studs mostly in black or grey with a few red thrown in for good measure. Two red larger headlight bricks introduced by the BrickHeadz theme are also included with this set. It&rsquo;s nice to see them integrate these elements into the builds of regular sets, it shows how versatile the parts can be if you&rsquo;re just starting out with MOC ideas.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Aquaman: This version of Aquaman might look like a blonde version of the movie character, but it is actually based on a look Aquaman had in the comics during the 90s, if I remember when this look was introduced correctly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">His torso print is a more muscular looking version of the classic Aquaman Minifigure print. It is a dual-sided print, his hair is a blonde version of the movie release hair piece. His face also shares the print detailing of that version, but with a lighter toned beard and mustache, the expressions are the same though if I recall correctly, smiling and angry. For accessories he has his golden trident and the new energy elements which are used to excellent effect to simulate water movements. Water blasts. And generally water. Hee, hee.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Batman: Batman hasn&rsquo;t changed much between 2018 and 2019, this print is the same as was seen in the Brother Eye Takedown set, among probably many others. This version includes a breathing apparatus and black flippers for underwater maneuvering, no cape and no Batarangs. Not much else to say, if you&rsquo;ve seen one Batman you&rsquo;ve seen them all.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bruce: Not really, but this set includes a Shark and Bruce is the name of a certain mechanical menace. The packaging seems to indicate that Batman is saving Aquaman from the shark, but unless Ocean Master is controlling the beast I highly doubt he&rsquo;d be a threat.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ocean Master: The menacing villain and Aquaman&rsquo;s half-brother. Ocean Master has a silver version of the Atlantis Trooper helmets seen in the Battle for Atlantis set, a black version of his sibling&rsquo;s trident, a very detailed dual-sided torso print, a soft-goods cape in rich purple a dual-sided facial print with one side having some red visor-like goggles covering the upper face and overall a very solid looking Minifigure design. It&rsquo;s also nice to have two of Aquaman&rsquo;s chief adversaries in LEGO form, since Batman has had to fight multiple version of his Rogue&rsquo;s Gallery for years.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">No numbered bags for this set, first you start out with the Minifigures and the new Energy Elements used to make effects parts for play or display options and then you get started on the brand new Batsub.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This version of the Batsub is built around the cockpit design, which is rather reminiscent of some of the old Aquazone submarines. It&rsquo;s a circular bubble design which is built up rather cleverly with some of those smooth arch bricks.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Stickers are used sparingly, mostly on the black NEXO shield unprinted elements for the detailing of the engines and Bat logo. Batman must brand all of his vehicles after all. The engines are on a separate build section which rotates using a simple Technic pin connection, making for a nice clean look once finished. The energy elements even get to be used here, attached to the rotors to simulate the movement of jet streams from the displacement of the vehicle. A very nice touch to this build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Batsub: This model is pretty solid, but it is also really twitchy. The cockpit is attached to the engines via a single Technic Pin, which allows you to spin the model around and angle the engines as you see fit. Attached to the back are two accessory elements, these can be placed here to show the submarine moving through the water and displacing water behind it while moving forward, or, can be attached to Minifigure clip holders to simulate water blasts from Aquaman and Ocean Master.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Two stud shooters are on the sides of the engines and a lot of dark detailing is seen thanks to the generous use of sticker placement. Overall I really appreciate this streamlined Batsub model, compared to some of the others, which were larger and a bit awkward looking, this one is stubbier and fun. There are also two manipulator arms in the front. Pretty fun to play with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;m going to go out of my way to say a few things here, first of all, the price point for 25$ CND is and has always been fairly solid when it comes to models, play opportunities and characters. The inclusion of multiple black unprinted NEXO power elements in this set is a genuine treat, and it makes sense to use it for detailing on Batman&rsquo;s vehicles. I love how versatile it has become and how many sets outside of the NEXO theme use them.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The character selection here is also pretty solid. My only issue is the inclusion of yet another LEGO Shark in these Aquaman sets. There are a whole host of other ocean life, octopi, squid, dolphins, whales, fish of every size imaginable and with any set featuring Aquaman it would be a perfect opportunity to include more variety. Rather than a shark it might have been nice to get our first LEGO Killer Whale (Orca) animal. I understand the animals cost a lot more to sculpt and make, but after decades of seeing an overpopulation of Great White Sharks in LEGO&rsquo;s oceans it might have been nice to see something new.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is pretty solid and for that reason I highly recommend it. You can&rsquo;t go wrong at this price point, more often than not, so aside from my one gripe about the serious lack of Ocean Fauna variety in LEGO World, still a solid set. Highly Recommended.</p>
