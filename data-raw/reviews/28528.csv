<p>- Magazine version has 3 fewer pieces (35 against 38)</p>

<p>- Magazine version is the same scale, but a few mm longer (the engine protrudes one stud further)</p>

<p>You can see a photo comparison of the models in my pictures:&nbsp;<a href=""http://imgur.com/a/Qb5DfGG"">http://imgur.com/a/Qb5DfGG</a></p>

<p>Overall, this is a nice set, but just like in the polybag, the command bridge is a bit flimsy. I can&#39;t tell which one I like more - the magazine set has a more interesting shape, whereas the polybag&nbsp;has a nice dab of darker grey to break the dullness. I can&#39;t quite decide which is the better representation of the movie original, because both sets are quite inaccurate in this matter ;)</p>

<p>Model is more-less the same size as previous ones, but belongs to the group of bigger sets. It has 38 pieces, which is typical in this type of sets. For me the most valuable ones are wedged plates in three different sizes. This blue plate is great addition to completely gray set, and is well hidden in final&nbsp;&nbsp;model.</p>

<p>Model hasn&#39;t got any crazy building technics but usage of hinged plates to end the hull of destroyer looks very well.&nbsp; Model is very durable so you can very easily&nbsp;grab it and fly around your room.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t say anything bad about it. It&#39;s small, durable, has pieces which, for it&#39;s price (around 3$), are very nice and useful in other constructions. Overall this set is worth buying.</p>
