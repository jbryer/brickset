<p>A worthy addition to the 2018 Arctic sub-theme of the City sets.&nbsp; I have all the theme bar the Arctic Mobile Exploration Base (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60195-1/Arctic-Mobile-Exploration-Base"">60195</a>), including the Arctic Ice Saw (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30360-1/Arctic-Ice-Saw"">30360</a>) attached to the November 2018 issue of the National Geographic Kids magazine and this fits perfectly with all of them.</p>

<p><strong>Packet</strong></p>

<p>As ever the free sets on the front of the comics is a foil bag with a fold over flap keeping all the pieces secure.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>This month (5th December 2018 to 8th January 2019)&nbsp;includes <em>Explorer Eric</em> who already appears in the Arctic Ice Saw (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30360-1/Arctic-Ice-Saw"">30360</a>), Arctic Ice Glider (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60190-1/Arctic-Ice-Glider"">60190</a>) and Arctic Mobile Exploration Base (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60195-1/Arctic-Mobile-Exploration-Base"">60195</a>).&nbsp; It is a shame that Lego have used the same figure in so many of the smaller sets from this theme.&nbsp; Indeed the three smaller sets, including the two polybags, have the same Minifigure in all of them.&nbsp; So if you are on a budget you could end up with only one unique Minifig.&nbsp; In recent years Lego have mixed the characters well and the numbers you would associate with City (starting <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-City/year-2018/subtheme-Arctic"">60###</a>)&nbsp;have a good combination of useful Minifigures, I just feel a different one in this set would have been better.</p>

<p><strong>Main Build/Parts</strong></p>

<p>The finished build is well constructed, solid and plays well.&nbsp; I do find Lego have, in recent years,&nbsp;tended to &quot;bump&quot; the piece count up by&nbsp;using two bits when one would do.&nbsp;&nbsp;This has two examples - in less than 40 pieces!&nbsp; They have used a 2x2 Bright Orange plate with a 2x6 Bright Orange plate to make a 2x8.&nbsp; This could be forgiven as it the parts do sit directly on a Black 2x8 plate, however they do it again with 1x2 and 2x2 plates to make a 2x3.&nbsp; There are no parts that I would describe as special and most have been used lots in the past so you are likely to be able to make your own if you have a sizable collection without needing to purchase the comic.</p>

<p>You also get a micro build (6 pieces) that represents ice and snow with a bone clipped on.&nbsp; Unlike other Arctic sets you don&#39;t have to dig the bone out.&nbsp; However, it&#39;s inclusion adds another level of playability to the set which would be lacking if this was the only Arctic set you had.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>After last months <em>Garbageman Gary </em>this set had a lot to live up to and although good I wouldn&#39;t recommend it unless, like me,&nbsp;you want all the sets in the 2018 Arctic Theme.&nbsp; For me Arctic Ice Glider (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60190-1/Arctic-Ice-Glider"">60190</a>) would be a better purchase as it is the same price (although you don&#39;t get the comic) and is a better looking vehicle in which you get exactly the same Minifigure.</p>

<p>Additionally the comic seems to have jumped from &pound;3.85 for Issue 9 to &pound;4.99 for Issue 10 (stopping it get 5 for Value for money).&nbsp; This could be because you get the Issue 1 Policeman and Crook (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/CITY951701-1/Policeman-and-crook"">951701</a>), so when we return to Issue 11 on 9th January 2018 the price may have reverted.&nbsp; I certainly hope so as the Mini-Jet from the new Sky Police theme looks terrible.&nbsp; This is still a&nbsp;fantastic price for&nbsp;two small sets and a comic, it&#39;s just the unexpected price rise needs noting and the extra set is something I already have as I bought the original comic.</p>
