How wrong I was!  This is almost completly different game!  Very well-done, in my opinion.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-24T00:16:34Z","This game is a lot of fun!","I enjoyed this game a lot.  It is fun trying to find the constructopedia pages.  The trading cards that you can collect on the game all look really cool!  Even after you complete the game it is fun trying to complete your trading card collection and talking to people.  It is also fun replaying the minigames.  I like the t-rex racing minigame and my brother loves apple grapple.  The island looks great after you repair it by gathering the constructopedia pages.  Lego island 2 is my favorit lego gba game!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"TurboJ","2012-06-15T06:57:12.247Z","Probably the best version of the game... Sadly.","Back when the game first came out, I remember wanting the PC version. Our computer wasn't powerful enough to run that, so I ended up getting the GBA version. Having seen the other versions of the game, I can honestly say that this was the right decision.<br><br>The gameplay style is very linear, a large step backwards from the first game. However this is slightly made up for in that you have complete freedom of the island, and this is a big island. There's a lot to see and do. My biggest complaint with the gameplay is that, because you're just looking for items and people, it can get quite boring. If you're trying to find an item/person on the other side of the island, it's not that fun getting there and looking.<br>The minigames are overall pretty darn fun. There's only the occasional one that I found frustrating.<br><br>The graphics are nice. They're very colourful and there is a lot of detail put into the island's scenery, something that the PC version lacks. My only complaint about this is that the 'camera' is zoomed in too close. You don't get to see much around you in the overworld, which means you'll be referring to your map quite a lot to check where you're going.<br><br>The music is my favourite part of the game. Having recently heard the PC version, I really didn't like the music that much - while the quality is better, the actual songs aren't as memorable and they feel cluttered. The songs in the GBA version loop a lot more than the PC version, but they sound much nicer as pieces of music.<br><br>The game isn't perfect. It can't hold a candle to the first Lego Island. But out of all versions of the game, this one is the best. Best presented, best looking (despite the 2D graphics), best sounding, and most of all no horrendous load times. If you really want to, hunt down a copy and give it a try.<br>",TRUE,4,1,1,4,4
