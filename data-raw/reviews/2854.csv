INTRO
I was racing along in Lego Racers 1, rounding corners, hitting short cuts, and passing in and out of warps.  Then all of a sudden, my car slows down, the graphics get better, but with less detail, and then I hit a checkpoint!  I look Up for help but all I see is &quot;sparky&quot; taking gibberish.  
What is this I say?
Why it's Lego Racers 2.

THE BEGINNIG
When I first started up Lego Racers 2 I was really impressed, I mean amazing graphics, free roam, and cool cut scenes!  But then after playing through the first few levels in story mode I realized that Lego Racers 2 hides more than just golden bricks.

DIFFICALTY
Lego Racers 2 is perhaps the easiest Lego game.  After you get past The Berg, you can beat it in a day.

LEVELS AND FEATURES
LEVELS- This is really the only problem I have with Lego Racers 2, the problem is it's a big one.  Instead of tracks like in Lego Racers 1, Lego Racers 2's tracks are just a bunch of check points put in random order in different &quot;worlds&quot;.  The same ones you free roam in.  This leads to no short cuts, cheap-o scenery, and a big problem if you stumble by a check point.
FEATURES- the new power-ups are as cheesy as the tracks; however the new car and driver customization is better.  Another new feature is free-roam witch is good, with one problem: to make sure you don't get lost Lego added &quot;sparky&quot; a little Lego dude that gives you advice this would be nice if what he was saying went along with the words at the bottom of the screen.

DRAWBACKS
What I said about the tracks, along with the fact every time sparky spoke gibberish, my friend and I would laugh are selves silly, make a big drawback.

THE END
Wow a second ago I just saw the opening cut scene.

Overall
This is a hard one, no matter how hard I try to hate the game I can't, but if I like it for what it is I feel like a &quot;nice&quot; reviewer.  That’s why I give this game 6/10.

"Bricknave","2009-03-17T17:26:36.7Z","A cool racing adventure, with some flaws ...","LEGO Racers 1 was short lived, but otherwise it was an awesome experience!  LEGO Racers 2 is cool and all .... Unfortunately it has some downsides.
Unlike LEGO Racers 1, this has more of a story to it.  You start out as a minifig being advised by another minifig named Sparky!  Then you go around worlds racing people, exploring, playing mini games in order to get upgrades and golden bricks (which you need to advance throughout the game).  You keep on doing this until challenge Rocket Racer.

Pros:
Racing
Minifig customization
Building your own cars
Ability to talk to characters
Cool things that you and a friend can both do
Upgrade system
Golden bricks to discover
Mini games
The ability to drive around without having to race

Seems good?  Lets look at the cons ...

Cons:
The steering is bad!  You can't finish a race without spinning out of control.
You have to drive through check points
Extremely limited minifig parts
You can't look at your car in different angles
Most of the characters say ""I really like to drink soda, I'm gonna catch you by the tummy!"" over and over again fast.
You can't get the grip upgrade until you beat almost the last boss
All of the mini games except the first and last one are all the same!

If you like check point racing systems and hard-to-control cars, then get this game.  The limited minifig parts and car build is fine, but the races are very frustrating!

 game is much better than the videogame LEGO Racers 1. The game is more fun, because you can also explore all the worlds you'll have to race. You can also build a minifig and a car and have an epic race. But be careful with your car: It will break easily if you hit something or if a power-up is hitting you during the race. The power-ups are much better and much stronger than in the first game and the race tracks are much better as well.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Lot's of cool races<br></li><li>The new tracks are awsome<br></li><li>There're scenes from themes like Adventurers, Space (Life On Mars), Town (City), Town (Arctic) &amp; Racers (Xalax)<br></li><li>Awsome Music<br></li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>There're some cars in this game which LEGO never produced as a set<br></li></ul>

get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.</p></div></div></div>",TRUE,5,1,5,5,5
