Loved the inclusion of Kai in the Legacy era uniform. The dragon model is extremely poseable for its wings and legs and can achieve some nice poses. I&rsquo;d recommend getting this for fans of Ninjago if you can find it at retail. It&rsquo;s a great little set to include with larger sets of the Theme for an awesome display of the first few seasons of LEGO Ninjago.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>I love dragons and this set is no exception. It looks quite good, even though it is very similar to the rooster. But it has everything that a roper dragon should have. Its wings are designed in really interesting way, using claws as kind of feather. It also has normal claws at the end of wings, which makes him even more realistic. They can be moved up and down, unfortunately there is no possible way to fold them. Legs are simple as they can be, with only three parts each, which is kinda sad, because it has one ugly uncovered stud on each limb. Other than that, they look cool, give the model enough stability, but can&#39;t be folded back.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Zom4H2RURAjhvK58viZGHzrs4eKpj1Ju1fq7skGTpQdVXMToGV1BK2Sx_OfK0XPbm7ULEQ8p4baSGWWf9E2GlakgGbmZQhFn4hYrD7XlAE2oVMIpcuJFJLmsSyvcTMEv52DN_qXGs8s=w2400[/img]</p>

<p>Head is that thing that gives the whole rooster vibe. It has cute goatee, big transparent eyes and a horn on top of that. It also features two smaller horns, both in gold, on the sides of the head. Neck is very simple has nice scaled pattern on it, but uses bricks in many colors, which makes it look not so well. Head and neck has good range of motion with two points of articulation, but requires a lot of attention during building process.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/eGC3iUGHlMz9ijsgLj9bAXQWCfrKvOH55i3oZugahZbaSE60ZftksZOlmPgb-QHYWbBKp4QvNEvOOSPSfeBkAf-hSbSyHwckUM0KLPoz_CMaV6J0GZM-4Vhy4U9NqFgKT1CO-aBuJXE=w2400[/img]</p>

<p>Body is not bad. Again, there are bricks in light gray, which don&#39;t fit in well with the rest of the&nbsp;model. I think it&#39;s finally time for lego to make ball joints in more colors than just one. Second flaw of the body is that it is completely studded on the top. There is a place to put a minifig on, and the rider has some kind of stick to hold to, but it looks just poor. Behind the minifig there are to studs left, which makes this model look unfinished. Adding a cheese slope there would have solved the problem. Flaming tail is a nice addition.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Jyl4z52OP_4sAdhYK0dPSXFk2MW1IzvIICOzmL2QplRTK8M1-u079tojx4dSoEDMBm2X0IfdwvvGB6H7JhT43_O_BbYoeK0a0FaMWdtDBHmaFiaftLAngNX5xCC_Yuff3CLC54pRWOs=w2400[/img]</p>

<p>The model is quite sturdy, doesn&#39;t require big dose of carefulness while playing, but has some parts that are rather weak and tend&nbsp;to fall apart.</p>

<p><strong>Minifig</strong></p>

<p>We got Kay, the red ninja here. Unfortunately in this set only he is not in his Legacy robe, but instead in a suit from SoG season. Don&#39;t get me wrong, the suits is great, has much more of the classic Japan style than many other, but it&#39;s a pity they don&#39;t give us a proper one, one that come from this line.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kOjuM7kHxENBJZVWlwhFBYUlRleKacPVG7Q8-qaNzAEslVT6dilxKIqyRwHFNM0uIMQFb8iWpha8RkLP-rU5c15BIJUIi5fAZ0MGj9Q0Lcx4HgUGx6o0lsWEQI3yUgsrjvUuyOZak1c=w2400[/img]</p>

<p>Suit is red whit some dark red dots and details on it. He has two black belts, one on his waist, the second one across the body, with dark yellow border and inscription &#39;fire&#39; in Ninjago language. At his back there is a dark gray symbol of a flower. He has some subtle printing on his legs. Mask is in the new standard, suiting Legacy line. Face is typical to this character since The Lego Ninjago Movie. One face is angry, the other one is happy, but when you put a mask on his head, happy face become a scared one. Fig is equipped with classic silver katana.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There is a couple of cool ones, like four sets of ball joints, and robot arms both in gold and dark red. Claws in dark yellow also are quite unique.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fJyuowHvlprcvgXi8AxU067PQeAOEYEYzsPllFC4sDINiUJu1GKh-fHbl1rncCOj_2JOlAUyHK_5pdVuBhbKr3mXToWCmlck15xYplvPsK-hx75k97ikYCbcqqQbFwNU8R_EBNEKp78=w2400[/img]</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Set is really nice. If you manage to get this on some kind of promotion (I get it with some magazine), don&#39;t hesitate, just buy it. It is clearly worth anything less than $5. Model looks cool, flaws are minor, both parts and fig are good. This set is easily worth recommending.</p>
