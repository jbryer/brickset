<p>Being a big fan of the Ninjago&nbsp;dragons, I was thrilled when the Ultra Dragon was announced. Just as the other sets in the Ninjago&nbsp;Legacy wave of sets it is a re-imagined version of the dragon in the <strong>Epic Dragon Battle (set 9450)</strong>.&nbsp;Where the old&nbsp;set included the Devourer and some structure, this set only has a token spring-loaded shooter included with the Ultra Dragon.</p>

<p>Overall, this set was a lot of fun to build. I like brick built heads, and the overall very impressive dragon. Personally this is one of my favourite&nbsp;dragons; it stacks up well with the likes of <strong>Firstbourne&nbsp;(set 70653)</strong>, the <strong>Green Ninja Mech Dragon (set 70612)</strong>, the <strong>Morro&nbsp;Dragon (set 70736) </strong>and <strong>Master Wu&nbsp;Dragon (set 70734)</strong>. There is a nice selection of bad guy minifigures&nbsp;(4 in total) and 2 good guys (Wu and Lloyd). The posability and mobility of the dragon is OK, though it might have been nice to have a little more movement in the legs. The heads IMHO are one of the stronger elements of the set.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is a good set, and - together with the <strong>Monastery of Spinjitzu (set 70670)</strong> - is a worthy choice for top set of the Legacy wave. It is expensive (still some 30 euros&nbsp;cheaper than the Epic Dragon Battle), but IMHO worth saving for. Also, overall, I think the RRP is OK. If you come across this set&nbsp;at a discount, I would not hesitate to get it.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>This set took me some 2 hours and 15 minutes to build, and building it was quite enjoyable. The heads are somewhat repetitive, but it could have been a lot worse. There are relatively few stickers, 6 or 7. These stickers do enhance the looks of the dragon considerably, IMHO.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I like how the body was built up. The tail is constructed in a way similar to that of other dragons with a flailing tail - like the Green Ninja Mech Dragon. The dominant colour of the dragon is white, and to me many of the parts seem to be quite useful in a landscape filled with ice. Unlike with the previous version, now the wings of the dragon are represented by a foldable plastic, much like those of Firstbourne, supported by a skeleton&nbsp;of Technic bars.</p>

<p>The Technic elements in the core of the dragon are well integrated, and by and large nicely covered up. The few off colour pieces that are used during construction are well covered, thankfully. I did not encounter truly special construction techniques, though the mechanism to operate the wings is cleverly done. Even if many of the techniques used might be fairly common and simple, they have been used to great effect.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>This set has six minifigures, where the Epic Dragon Battle included seven. Just like in that one, there are&nbsp;four bad guys included in this set. The difference is that for the bad guys, they only have the four-armed Lord Garmadon&nbsp;in common. The other bad guys included are Pythor, Lasha and Spitta. In both sets Lloyd and Sensei Wu are included as the good guy. Jay ZX is missing.</p>

<p>I truly like the minifigures, and think they are quite high quality. Well printed, detailed, nice facial expressions, all in register. Rather uncommon, Sensei Wu is wearing a black garb, with some gold details on his torso and legs. This might arguably be my favourite&nbsp;Sensei Wu yet.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Overall, this dragon looks awesome, and especially from the front, quite imposing. The four heads - representing fire, ice, earth and lightning - look very good. They are varied in appearance, and their colourful details give them each a distinctive look. They are a prime example of how quite simple techniques and clever use of pieces can give each dragon&#39;s head its own character. Just as with the last wave of dragons, the eyes are actually printed, this time on 2x2 bricks. The seat/throne for Lloyd as dragon-operator looks brilliant.</p>

<p>The result is that each of the heads truly has its own character, rather than the same shape with different colours. Rather than shooting balls, each head now has two stud-shooters. I like how the tail is constructed, with the trans-green spikes. In general it is a nice re-imagining of the original dragon.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>The designers have kept one one of the original play features intact: the handle to carry the whole dragon, and - if picked up - have the wings in a flying position. I think that a great decision. Add to that the four individual heads with stud shooters, the flailing tail, and the spring-loaded venomary dart shooter, and you have a nice play set. The many villains only add to the whole package.</p>

<p>The dragon itself is impressive enough as a display piece. It is unfortunate IMHO that there is no way to display the dragon standing with its wings out (like for instance with Firstbourne)&nbsp;without some modification. To me, it is about even. All I can say is that if one collects Lego dragons (and Ninjago dragons in particular) that this will be one of the top pieces in a collection.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this is a very good re-imagining of an older set, and definitely worth it. To me, it does not feel like a &#39;money grab&#39;. Arguably it would be worth it getting this one even if you do possess the original Ultra Dragon found in the Epic Dragon Battle set. Its price is IMHO acceptable, and the Price Per Part is in fact lower than that of the 2012 original. IMHO this is a set worth saving for, and I hope it will be available for quite some time - preferably for the 2019 Holiday Season.</p>
