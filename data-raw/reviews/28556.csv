Then Fury sees that he is turning to dust and drops the pager, revealing that he sent a message to Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel. After A3 many of us wondered what Fury&#39;s history was with Carol Danvers, but the Captain Marvel trailers reveal that they fought together to stop the Skrull&nbsp;invasion in 1995.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><em>Captain Marvel&nbsp;</em>is the newest member of the Marvel Cinematic Universe hero line-up, and she is supposedly the most powerful. The minifigure&nbsp;looks pretty good, using Black Widow hair in medium&nbsp;nougat and reusing Qira&#39;s head from Solo: a Star Wars Story which works okay, but I wish she had a binary/powered-up face. The torso is easily the best part because it&nbsp;is a specialized new print for Capt. Marvel and looks great! She has plain blue legs which is sad because her red boots are such a prominent feature of the character in the trailer and they could have just reused Spider-Man&#39;s (2016) dual molded legs:(!! Carol is equipped with 2 blue power blasts which are cool, but they should be yellow or orange.</p>

<p><em>Nick Fury&nbsp;</em>looks much younger than previous versions of the super-spy and this is from before he loses his eye. He looks perfect, but he also has a much simpler costume than Capt. Marvel in the movie. His hair is standard Finn hair from Star Wars, and his head is from Cyborg in DC Comics, but both of these pieces work fine I think. He has a nice new shirt with tie print on the torso, featuring a holster. Nick has plain black legs and is equipped with a gray&nbsp;gun.</p>

<p><em>Talos&nbsp;</em>is the leader of the shape-shifting Skrull&nbsp;invaders. He gets a weird new light green ear and top of head piece that looks respectable but unfortunately lacks printing. His head is a good print with a wrinkly&nbsp;Skrull-style&nbsp;scowl. The torso looks good but not&nbsp;quite perfect when compared to the movie. I know how long it takes to produce a set so this is excusable. Talos has plain black legs and is equipped with a black stud shooter.</p>

<p><em>Goose the Cat&nbsp;</em>is the same cat design as The LEGO Movie version but I think that it still looks great! Not much to say about this but I do want to theorize that Goose has a larger part in the&nbsp;plot than expected......</p>

<p>Well these minifigures&nbsp;are&nbsp;pretty respectable but it seems like LEGO&#39;s trend of making super awesome and amazing figures for Star Wars but not for Super Heroes is continuing as none of them have leg printing when Capt. Marvel and Talos would definitely benefit from them. I feel Carol also should&nbsp;have a new print for her head with a powered-up face. I can&#39;t complain too much though, because LEGO didn&#39;t have to make these figures and I&#39;m am sure glad that they did and while I may not like some of the decisions, I have to respect them because TLG has been doing this for a long time and they have a budget.</p>

<p><strong>S.H.I.E.L.D. Quinjet (1995 style)</strong></p>

<p>While they figures weren&#39;t perfect, this jet is pretty perfect for $30 dollars. It is surprisingly large and well detailed. The cockpit is big enough for one figure and has a control panel. The wings are simple but effective with their folding winglets. The engine units&nbsp;are well detailed and feature folding fins and trans-blue exhaust ports. Under the wings there is a remote flick-fire missile shooter. This is sooooooo much better than normal though&nbsp;because it shoots 4 missiles instead of one. This is on both sides of the Quinjet. The back is plain but features the traditional Quinjet&nbsp;ramp, but cat-sized this time and (obviously) fits Goose inside.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final Opinion</strong></p>

<p>I really like the Quinjet&nbsp;for a $30 set and Nick Fury and Goose look great as well. Captain Marvel and Talos look good enough to tell which character they represent, but they are not perfect. I recommend this set for Marvel fans because its a great way to get Carol and Nick in a cheap MCU set plus the rest of the set is good as well.</p>

<p>I hope this was helpful!!!!!</p>

"Brentski","2019-02-24T22:11:27.67Z","Marvelous set","<p>This review is being written 2 weeks prior to release of Captain Marvel and Avengers Endgame, so this is the first taste of a Lego set from the scheduled block busters for the year.</p>

<p>Mini figs: A</p>

<p>Three mini figs are included,(4 if you count Goose the cat). Two of which are new characters. The first iteration of CM is descent, although I feel the hair isn&#39;t quite right. Nick Fury looks&nbsp;just&nbsp;right for a younger&nbsp; version. The skrull face is a nice print, the ears are a hat type overlay, which feels a little off. The Skrull body is fairly plain, but is still a nice piece. Goose is one of the normal cat poses, but still nice. A nice mix/group.</p>

<p>The Skrull seems like a perfect Lego villain. With shape shifting abilities, it just begs to be constantly rearranged, more so than some other figures.</p>

<p>Parts: A</p>

<p>A fair amount of bigger plates for this set,&nbsp; and a good number of unusual pieces. The price per piece index works out to your advantage given the number of larger plates and specialized pieces. The color scheme is fairly basic, but produces a fine end product.</p>

<p>Building B+</p>

<p>The build took about an hour and a half, with a couple missteps&nbsp;on my part. Rockers give some angles, especially on the tail section, which I find visually appealing.&nbsp;The only downside was the two wing sections. I had to use some of my extra pieces to fill in the body of the jet to get them to lay flat, and they are not attached securely. The entire wing assembly comes off easily in one piece; good that it doesn&#39;t disintegrate&nbsp;entirely and can go back on readily, bad that it isn&#39;t attached better.</p>

<p>Playability: B-</p>

<p>I think this set has a lot of potential for play, my one concern is the wing attachment issue. The new figures are nice, see comments on Skrulls above.</p>

<p>Overall Value: A</p>

<p>This is a fine addition to virtually any Lego collection. 2 brand new characters, and a younger Fury. The jet is visually appealing, and I can&#39;t wait to see what other sets come from Captain Marvel.</p>

"andyh1984","2019-03-16T00:07:54.78Z","More substantial than it looks","<p><b>Build</b></p>

<p>The build reminded me of sets from years ago which may be intentional as the craft is &quot;in universe&quot; supposed to be from the 1990&#39;s. It is a bit larger and more substantial than I thought it would be but even though there is a hatch at the back it is mostly cosmetic and you would have to just lie a Minifigure down and push them in, and even then ones with large head or hairpieces may not fit in the narrow space. That said it is a really nice very playable ship and doesn&#39;t feel fragile at all. I would advise applying the stickers using tweezers or similar as they are clear plastic and fingermarks on the adhesive will show, especially on the canopy so if buying for a child an adult might want to do these.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The Minifigures are as you would expect quite detailed although Captain Marvels hair doesn&#39;t look right in either colour or style but maybe this is the closest they have without making new parts and colours or they were working from pre-production descriptions or images. The Skrull is nice if a bit too&nbsp; bright green but maybe due to the same reasons as Captain Marvels hair. And last but not least Nick Fury with hair and two eyes and a good torso piece.</p>

<p><strong>Overall&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>I like this set a lot and I am glad I bought it, the quinjet is a different build than we are used to and that&#39;s good. The Minifigures are nice but maybe another Skrull could have been included as I expect there are a few more in the movie.</p>

"K_dubble_S","2019-05-12T06:47:12.69Z","Wooshable ship","<p>Great minifigs, although would have been nice to get some printing on the skrulls head piece, looks a bit odd after such beautiful printing on the head only to have a plane lime green ear piece put on top. Great young Nick Fury.</p>

<p>The ship is a nice build, but I feel like there could have been a better use of space in the back, you can only fit 1 Minifig in the cockpit and only goose the cat can fit in the rear. Would have been nice to have a more movie accurate version where you could fit at least 2 minifigs in the front and maybe a better use of the rear were you could sit the other minifigs.</p>

<p>For &pound;25 (I only paid &pound;20) it&#39;s a nice wooshable ship and a nice take on the repeated Quinjet. The grey and red colour palette works well for the 90s theme of the movie.</p>

<p>4/5 overall</p>

"Savy666","2019-05-27T01:55:05.647Z","Another Marvel Aircraft","<p>This isn&#39;t a bad build, the play&nbsp;is definitely a 5 considering not only the swoosh ability but the push quad cannons and moveable flaps make playing with it fun.</p>

<p>The build was entertaining and the mini-figures are great, blue action splash&#39;s are included for Captain Marvel.</p>

<p>The gripe I have, and I write this every review for sets like this,&nbsp;is not with the set itself but the trend that Lego have with some of the smaller sets is that they do not package the instructions and stickers together in their own bag, they are left loose and and fending for themselves in a box full of bricks out to bend them, because of this the larger stickers were pretty much unusable, and I contacted Lego who are sending replacements, they really do have the best customer service but I really do wish they would change this trend.</p>
