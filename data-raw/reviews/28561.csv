<p>The set comes in a polybag&nbsp;which can be opened and resealed.&nbsp;Current price on the aftermarket, shortly&nbsp;after the release of the set is in average 89&euro;. Not too bad, if you want to bring the price down of your 75192 investment.</p>

<p>However, seen in the light of LEGO&#39;s promise for some amazing extras for black VIP card holders, the set disappoints. Imho&nbsp;no effort at all went into the design of the minifig&nbsp;which is&nbsp;exclusive to this set. In addition the minifig&nbsp;will annoy any minifig&nbsp;collector who is not a black VIP card holder.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>LEGO has missed a great opportunity with the release of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75192-1/Millennium-Falcon"">75192 UCS Millennium Falcon</a>. The second radar dish should have been the promised extra for black VIP members instead of having it in the box from the start. It would have been an amazing add on for any Falcon owner&nbsp;and every other AFOL would have been happy. Another idea with the same result&nbsp;would have been a&nbsp;lighting bricks kit for the Falcon. But this of course would have meant additional development of a new system.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The frame comes with a dummy VIP card as shown on the brickset.com database picture. The backside of the card features the LEGO Star Wars logo.</p>

<p>My frame is open, built and on my shelf. It is a nice memory from the day I stood in line with many other AFOLs&nbsp;waiting for the midnight release of 75192. I like to thank LEGO for sending this set and hope that my critique of the set has been helpful. Thanks for reading.</p>
