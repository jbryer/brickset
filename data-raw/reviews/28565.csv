<p>The build was nice&nbsp;for a Brickhead. The fun is building the details, as the core of every Brickhead is pretty much the same. I like the clever use of the ball/knobs on the nose of the head. The hair is well done, and nice to build. The table and the balloons are simple but effective constructions. The candle in the cake is nice. The Happy Birthday is a sticker, as there are various language options.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a whole, I am not completely sure about the colour-scheme, but that is personal taste. Overall, the set is nice and quite celebratory. The design could quite easily be adapted by swapping the colours. Overall, I do think this is a good set, worth getting if you like Brickheadz, or simply something different.</p>
