<p>The build itself is quick, simple and fun. I like how the floppy ears are done. The rose is simple but effective.&nbsp;The heart piece is made from just 4 pieces. There are no spectacular colours&nbsp;visible, or truly special pieces. As an example of minimalist Brickheadz&nbsp;design, this is one of the very best: no special prints, no special pieces, perhaps some recolours&nbsp;maybe.</p>

<p>If you can get it, it is simply a fun set to get or gift.&nbsp;</p>
