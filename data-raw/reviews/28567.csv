It has a lot of pieces, is a whole lot of fun to build and the result is very impressive. As far as looks and build experience this little set might be the best Brickheadz set ever. The way the dragon head is constructed is a lot of fun, with great parts use. It is actually inspirational. Apart from the construction techniques used, it also has some nice parts - most notably the gold scale pieces...</p>

<p>By itself it is a nice figure to display, that can easily stir up some conversation. If you like Brickheadz, something oriental or simply having fun building a little set, getting this set should be high on the list.</p>
