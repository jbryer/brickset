<p>I swopped the &#39;heads&#39; round in the flowers and the lavender one went in the white flower and the bright light orange into the lavender flower.</p>

<p>I&#39;m afraid I wasn&#39;t overly&nbsp;impressed with the feet.&nbsp; I thought they were rather clumsy and perhaps the designer had run out of steam?</p>

<p>So........The feet start on Page 23 Section 22 of the instruction booklet.&nbsp; I used the tan crosses and on each one, as shown in booklet, I put a 1x2 orange brick topped with one 1x2 orange plate.&nbsp; I then used six bright light orange plates with horizontal tooth (part no. 49668).&nbsp; Three each of these were placed on the tan parts of the cross that were still visible, facing out to the front.</p>

<p>That, for me, made the difference between a square toed chick and something that approached a real chick&#39;s feet.&nbsp; Not quite sure why a tan 3x3 cross was chosen.&nbsp; I would have thought a dark orange would have been more appropriate but maybe the cost&nbsp;was the driving factor there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A few more &#39;feathers&#39; would have been nice but presumably again costs came into play here.</p>

<p>If you are a Brickheadz fan this is a nice little set to add to your collection.&nbsp;</p>
