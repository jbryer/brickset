And quite frankly I&rsquo;m surprised that they released three BrickHeadz in a single box. They could have just given us an ordinary sized model and a smaller model akin to Yoda or Hedwig, but no, they felt we needed a good value and a decent holiday display so we have two smaller models with a regular model. This is a really impressive set, and quite a nice compliment for Mr. and Mrs. Clause from the previous year.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">In keeping with BrickHeadz packaging design we find a very nice festive themed box showcasing the three models and their model numbers. Included in this set are #85, 86 &amp; 87 and the box is a nice festive green with the image of a Christmas Tree seen in the background. On the side panel we see all of the models from 2019, the hard to sell Puppy, Chick and the very difficult to find Ghost along with the three models from this set. That is every holiday themed set made available.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The box unfortunately damaged the instructions, there are two different manuals included in this box alongside a sticker sheet. One of the manuals is medium sized and longer than the other smaller manual, but both are packaged flat in the box. Or meant to be. Instead of being secure, mine were bent and creased making them unfortunately a little harder to follow along with because keeping them open was a bit of a chore.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There are quite a number of exclusive parts in this set, many brown elements, tiles and plates and things for the Reindeer, and several green and red elements to make Elf and Elfie. You get a fair number of large headlight bricks as is customary in this set, but there are also the smaller model versions of the element used to make BrickHeadz heads, the 1x1 tall headlight bricks. Very versatile and very impressive selection of parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: In a reversal of the numbering scheme for the three models, 86 and 87 BrickHeadz are built with bag number 1. Inside you will find all of the parts necessary to build Elf and Elfie, two cute little models that are shorter in scale and statue compared to the regular LEGO BrickHeadz model. Their builds are relatively quick and fun, each one decked out in either red or green and with different styles of caps or hair for Elfie in this case. A solid pair of builds that weren&rsquo;t too difficult and did not require any sticker use.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: The standard BrickHeadz model, the Reindeer, is built with this numbered bag and you rely on quite a number of brown elements with a few white, black and light tan used to compliment the character. This Reindeer has no official name, so we can make it any one of Santa&rsquo;s eight reindeer. The antlers were a clever little build and the fluffy tail on his back is adorable. Stickers are used for details on the mailbox and the signs on the signpost. I&rsquo;m a little surprised they didn&rsquo;t just print them for this set, as it is a BrickHeadz set and should have used printed signs at least, even if the mailbox element couldn&rsquo;t have featured a print.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Elf &amp; Elfie: As I noted above both of these models are color coded. Elf is dressed in red and has a red stocking cap while Elfie is sporting green with a pointed cap and visible hair, this is how you know which one is which as the box places the names differently with the pictures&hellip; unless LEGO really intended Elf to be the one wearing green and having a full head of hair while Elfie is dressed in red. Which seems like it should definitely be the other way around if that is the case. Both smaller models are pretty impressive and cute.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Reindeer: This model is larger and looks great. With some unique build techniques, including the use of a bridge element and a few white bricks to make the underbelly a different colour on this character, Reindeer looks great. He stands on a base which features a sign post indicating how close you are to Brick and LEGOLAND respectively and that they are currently in the North Pole. A mailbox with letters to Santa is included as is some snowy terrain side-builds. Overall a solid model and quite a nice compliment to last year&rsquo;s Mr. &amp; Mrs. Claus.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This was an extremely impressive collection of models and I enjoyed building them. As with all BrickHeadz, if you don&rsquo;t care much for the design you probably won&rsquo;t be interested in these, no matter what a review says about them. The only downsides to this set in my opinion is not including Printed signs and the unfortunate packing method which damaged my instruction manuals. Still, I&rsquo;d recommend this set, as I do with all BrickHeadz, because they are just all kinds of fun. Now to pick up Mr. &amp; Mrs. Claus in January to stand alongside them. Recommended.</p>
