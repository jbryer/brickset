<p>The figure itself is more suited to odd builds, I lean towards nautical at the moment, and the pirate theme got me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts are neat, reusable for lots of finishing or detailing. But the building was actually harder than expected for such a small set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I found the figure itself to be uninteresting, and although I don&#39;t play so much as diorama,&nbsp; not very good. It needs to balance perfectly on the wheel and four legs, and doesn&#39;t fit well with any setup outside the Lego movie stuff.</p>

<p>How does this one fit into your collection from such a small set?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lets dive in!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Packaging:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just like 30527 with Lucy. A nice shot with what you will get once you are done assembling MetalBeard.&nbsp; However, it does say this is a 3 in 1 set on the front. Interesting.</p>

<p>A bag of the parts you need and a fold-out instruction manual. Sadly, no instructions are provided for the alternate builds. You must visit a webpage to get the other two instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Minifigure/Build:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well in this case MetalBeard is a bit of a tragic tale. He is the build as his body sadly ran into some sad circumstances prior to the events of the first LEGO Movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So we get a one-wheeled sabre wielding MetalBeard here. And he looks nice. This being my first MetalBeard I am not sure what other versions of his head piece we get but I like this one and his hair piece bicone hat. Additionally, I like the robot build for him. He actually looks fairly well fleshed out at this size and while he is larger than a regular minifigure he does not totally overwhelm them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I found the construction more than satisfactory though getting those little clips he has for legs on might prove a bit toilsome for the smallest and not the strongest of hands. Still, overall he looks great. Like a mishmash of ship pieces and road-hog with dual cutlasses to boot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I opted not to make the the alternate builds (they seemed way too small and dull) I had these parts left over when i finished. I also used his telescope piece to extend his mast build slightly.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I wanted a MetalBeard and I got a MetalBeard. That is all I needed the set to be. However, I know he is more than just what he makes himself to be. He is a huge character who has his preferred look. However, if you are on a budget and have limited space I think this version of our beloved pirate is satisfactory.&nbsp;</p>

Honestly though I wouldn&rsquo;t be too sure of that. Anyway let&rsquo;s cover the pros and cons and then give final thoughts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">MetalBeard Model very solidly built and designed.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Alternative builds fit the theme of Steampunk Pirate MetalBeard.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Unique and interesting ideas behind the set. Good use of parts and great for fans of the character.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Online instructions for alternative models only, no physical manual for all three builds. Difficult to find as well.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Limited parts for the price.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Not a terrible set, I like the idea behind it, but is it worth picking up? Honestly, yes, I feel this is a very nicely scaled version of MetalBeard for your Minifigure collection and it&rsquo;s a great way to get the character without needing to pay a high price for the character. I&rsquo;d recommend tracking this down if you can and adding it to your collection. The alternative models are fairly amusing too, especially Pirate Ship MetalBeard. Highly Recommended.</p>

"vikings","2020-06-09T05:20:29.27Z","MetalBeard","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a normal polybag with normal polybag size instructions. You don&#39;t get instructions for the other two builds and you have to online to www.LEGO.com/buildmoremovie2 to get the other two builds.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some nice parts in this set. You get the pirate hat, pirate sword, a gold flag, a gold scope, and a trans orange flame. You get a lot of brown pieces and some gold parts as well. The total piece count for the set is 42.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:</b></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build. I have done the other builds and they are not as good as the original one is.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall Opinion:</b></p>

<p>Overall this is an okay polybag. It is cool that you can build three different creations out this set,&nbsp;but they don&#39;t look great, and aren&#39;t better than the original. The build has four legs and a wheel under it to stabilize it, I am not a fan of the wheel underneath it because it makes slightly harder to stabilize. You have two arms that hold a gold scope and a pirate sword. He has a gold flag on the back. Overall this is a decent polybag. I do recommend this to any Lego Movie fans, if you aren&#39;t a fan of the movie or sets this might not be for you. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 3-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
