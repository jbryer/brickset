<p><strong>Welcome to Apocalypseburg</strong> fits the mold of a number of recent sets, being the (super) high end (display) set for a (movie-related) theme. Predecessors are <strong>The Joker Manor (set 70922)</strong>, linked to the Lego Batman Movie, <strong>Jurassic Park: T-Rex Rampage (set 75936)</strong>, linked to Jurassic Park, and&nbsp;<strong>Ninjago City (set 70620)</strong> and <strong>Ninjago City Docks (70657)</strong>, linked to the Lego Ninjago Movie. It is not also in a similar price range, but, with the exception of Ninjago City , is also similar in piece count.&nbsp;Conceptually it seems to share most with Ninjago City Docks, being quite modular.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building the set is a lot of fun, and from the start shows quite an understanding of Lego geometry. The base and fallen Statue of Liberty do rely on a Technic core, mostly clad with regular Lego plates and hidden behind regular brick walls. The partially (modular) construction also makes it easy to turn this into a &#39;community&#39; build, or a spread the building out over multiple days. It is also very nice to see how the fallen Lady Liberty gets her shape. It is IMHO very well designed. I also like the references to other movies / Lego sets. Of the 12 minifigures&nbsp;+ one mannequin a total of 10 minifigures are unique! Only Emmet is common, while Lucy can also be found in <strong>Emmet&nbsp;and Lucy&#39;s Escape Buggy (set 70829)</strong>. All minifigures are well done. The set is also big enough to leave space for more minifigures to be included.</p>

<p>This is not a typical play set. There is plenty of room to play on the outside, and for minifigures to do there. Unfortunately the interior of many of the dwellings is less accessible. The modular aspect provides some accessibility, but it still inhibits the play value. At least one module is actually completely inaccessible.</p>

<p>Now the big question: is this set worth it? Personally, as a fan of these types of sets, I would say yes. A lot of it comes down to the looks of this set, and personal appeal. Price per part is OK. The number of minifigures is good (in comparison to other similar tier sets). It is also big (though it does not look as massive as Ninjago City, it probably takes up similar space. Yet RRP is still a whole lot of money. If you can find it at a discount, this set does become attractive, and something to save for.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build starts with constructing a base-plate, similar to that of sets like The Joker Manor or <strong>Disney Castle (set 71040)</strong>. The number of parts per bag(s) is limited, making construction easy, and something that many younger kids should be able to accomplish. The designer has chosen to first build up one half of the ground floor, then the second half. During this phase, the first of (very) many stickers are applied - a number that rivals that of Ninjago City. Many smaller details are already included.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After the ground floor halves are connected, the construction of Lady Liberty is started as well. Although slightly lacking depth in comparison to the actual statue, it is still brilliantly done. The various modular dwellings are organically stacked against it on the front. The best part is that there is only a limited number of unsightly gaps, despite the odd angles.</p>

<p>The techniques used to create the various&nbsp;planes, shapes and angles are interesting, especially for the construction of the Statue of Liberty&#39;s face and torch. There are a lot of large sand green pieces that might be interesting for various MOCs. There are a few places where the underlying core is visible, but that works well with the post-apocalyptic theme. The weakest structural element is IMHO the attachment of the bath-tub vehicle, which comes off way too easily.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, LEGO lists a total of 13 minifigures, of which 12 are actual minifigures. One is a mannequin, displaying&nbsp;post-apocalyptic armour. The prints are well done, and original. The faces are very interesting, and many of them arguably can be used in many &#39;regular&#39; minifigure configurations. So can most of the hair pieces. There are 9 minifigures with alternate faces, that mostly actually do present a completely different mood.&nbsp;Quite a few of the minifigures have additional pieces: pauldrons, shoulder armor and such. For me, Harley Quinn is the best minifigure of the lot.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The surface area&nbsp;of this set is considerable, though less than the likes of <strong>The Joker Manor</strong> or <strong>Jurassic Park: T-Rex Rampage</strong>, but comparable to that of <strong>Ninjago City</strong> and <strong>Ninjago City Docks</strong>. As mentioned earlier, Welcome to Apocalypseburg also shares the modular aspect with the two Ninjago related sets, especially the latter of the two. But where in those sets the modules correspond to traditional dwellings, here the modules tend to be based on junk: cars, containers and best of all, a tram. The only seemingly &#39;traditional&#39; building is the coffee-shop/police station, which I think is based on a garage. All of these are well done, and nice little builds on their own, and very well detailed. This set is fitted with numerous jokes and references in the builds and details, like for instance the grille of <strong>The Batmobile (set 70905)</strong> from the Lego Batman Movie</p>

<p>The Statue of Liberty is also well designed, and I generally like the way the designer has been able to capture the sculpture. Arguably the face is a bit narrow. I also like the way the designer has included some olive green and grey&nbsp;pieces to add some &#39;life&#39; to the sculpture. The same has been done with the flame of the torch. The additional &#39;observation&#39; deck in the crown is a nice copy of the observation balcony inside the actual statue. Personally I am not a fan of the rather plain flat back side of the statue... I would have liked to have seen one or two more structures being stacked against it... arguably something that can be created fitting personal preference. What I also like is how just about every place in this structure can realistically be used by the minifigures: there are all kinds of connecting stairs, ladders and balconies. Other than into the observation platform, the minifigures can get everywhere without &#39;apparating&#39;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The post-apocalyptic environment also allows for a lot of variety, and I like how the designer has made use of it. Every module has its own character, both in design and in purpose. All in all, the designer has created a complete village, with many of the basic necessities being present. The many stickers - something that will be off-putting to quite a few people - doe definitely enhance this sets&#39;&nbsp;character.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>These high end sets are as much about display as play - and apart from <strong>The Joker Manor</strong> - one could argue they are more about the former than the latter. You can easily play with minifigures on the outside, but having them make use of the structures means having to take the modules off, and take them apart. It is more like a display set in which you can recreate many small scenarios. The wrecked van has to actually be taken apart to be able to put a minifigure inside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a display set is actually quite impressive; the reaction of quite a few people is &#39;wow, what is this?&#39; when they first see this set. This set is also big enough to pose all the included minifigures, as well as many of the minifigures from the Collectible Minifigure series on and in it without it becoming (extremely) crowded.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this is a good set, which - as the &#39;extreme&#39; set for the Lego Movie 2 wave - compares quite well with other similar sets. It has definitely its own, unique, character. It is quite a lot of fun to build, and the segmented character of the set allows for subdividing the build, and spread it out over multiple days and / or multiple individuals. The price is in line with similar sets, which is hefty but seems quite reasonable. Whether to get a set like this is IMHO in the first place dependent on one&#39;s willingness to pay this amount of money for a Lego set. Second, it is up to personal taste - whether you actually like the looks over that of similar sets. IMHO it is definitely worth it, especially if you look around, and maybe can get it at a discounted price.</p>

All those little details, like the bus, the hot tub and Batman&#39;s room in the head of Statue of Liberty - all of it is simply amazing! A postapocalyptic vibe is very strong in this set, but without grim or sadness. Hey, they still have their overpriced coffee! It took me 12 hours straight to build this monster and I have no plans&nbsp;for&nbsp;deconstruction - altough it has some very nice, unique parts that would be great in my other builds. And yes, it would be nice to have my table back, but... Apocalypseburg is&nbsp;simply too beautiful!&nbsp;</p>
