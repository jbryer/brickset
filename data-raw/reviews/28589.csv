<p>The Batmobile has been one of the most redesigned vehicles as it was forced to be adapted from comics to movies including TV series and, more recently, video games. With the Arkham&nbsp;series having two renditions of the Batmobile including a tank-esque vehicle (see the App-Controled Batmobile), the Bruce Timm animated series featuring the voice talent of Kevin Conroy having two unique styles (the first being possibly the most popular of all Batmobile), the Schumacher movies also having two, one Batmobile stood out as being part of the renaissance of the Batman or should I say the chance of exploring the psyche of the Batman and its true identity, Bruce Wayne and I&#39;m not talking about the one from the contemporary version of Batman by Christopher Nolan&nbsp;even though he brought The Dark Knight to a more grounded level by making a trilogy about the symbol and the idea of the Batman.</p>

<p>In 1989, Tim Burton blew up expectations by casting Michael Keaton as the Caped Crusader and it led to this renaissance of the superhero genre by making a&nbsp;movie in a modern setting where the Batman could possibly exist. Of course, we have the vat of chemicals that turned Jack Napier into the Joker played by the now-retired yet awesome actor Jack Nicholson so the realism is out of the window. In the meantime, we had Vicki Vale played by Kim Basinger&nbsp;being pretty much the audience character as she does her best to discover the truth about Bruce Wayne and eventually figure out the identity of the Batman. This is also a movie where the line is crossed with the Batman and possibly the reason why he now has a rule about no killing.</p>

<p>And of course, much like Christopher Nolan when he created his adaptation of the Batman, Tim Burton had to create the Batmobile from scratch. With the help of the late Anton Furst&nbsp;(winner of an Academy Award for the Art Direction on Batman in 1990) as well as Julian Caldow and the sculpt made by Keith Short in collaboration with Eddie Butler, the Batmobile from 1989 went on to become one of the recognized vehicles of all time. It has been featured in animated shows as well as an OnStar advertisement. In Batman: Arkham Knight, the Batmobile&nbsp;from 1989 (including The Dark Knight&#39;s Tumbler) is an extra piece of paid downloadable content along with the suit worn by Michael Keaton. It is only available for open-world driving and time-attack tracks. In real-life, it is exposed in conventions, car events, Warner Bros. expositions and definitely replicated by fans who can afford to build their own Batmobile from the ground-up.</p>

<p>And now come&nbsp;the parts&nbsp;because we finally have a LEGO set that not only celebrates the 30th anniversary of Batman (the 1989&#39;s movie) but also the 80th anniversary of the character created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger. And before I even enjoy Star Wars or most franchises, Batman was technically the first.</p>

<h3>Before the construction...</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve had the opportunity to pick up the set at the nearest LEGO store during Black Friday. Thankfully, it wasn&#39;t too crowded but on the way home, it was getting crazy on the freeway. Only 10 sets were still available to pick up at the store but I&#39;ve no idea how many of them were purchasable in total. That being said, I did pick up the set on release date and holy Batsy, this was one heavy box. I thought The Tumbler was heavy (or even the UCS Y-Wing) but this is on another level. The 1989 Batmobile&#39;s box is smaller than The Tumbler&#39;s and doesn&#39;t feel&nbsp;like a $250 set (or $300 CAD) but once you lift it and put it on the shelf for scan, you feel like holding the biggest LEGO set. Obviously, I do not own the latest Star Destroyer or the Millennium Falcon. I did see the Devastator Star Destroyer on display and I was amazed by its size but it&#39;s not something I can display at all even if I would have the money. This Batmobile is now the biggest set I&nbsp;own.</p>

<p>I did get all the bonus sets with the initial purchase including the minifig-scaled&nbsp;Batmobile&nbsp;Limited Edition. I did assemble the mini-Mobile first because I&#39;ve had to save the major work for later.</p>

<p>Once I opened the box, I did see the bags and I did spot the number 24 and my initial reaction was &quot;What have I done?&quot; because I knew I was in for a lot of work. Once I saw some of the tires, I&#39;ve had a question: &quot;Where the heck am I going to place this?&quot;. And then I see another box with a very strange design. It is obviously based on the Star Wars UCS sets since the Millennium Falcon from 2017 which I did see on the UCS Y-Wing but now, the 1989 Batmobile benefits from this treatment. After putting every bag, every tire and the instructions book on the table along with the boxes, I took a deep breath and took the time to absorb the shock of the amount of stuff I did buy out of one product.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the first minutes of getting prepped and stuffing&nbsp;things in order to build the set, I was wondering how big it was going to be at the end when everything was going to be assembled. I&#39;m also glad to report that there are no multiple bags of the same number, a problem I&#39;ve had with the The Tumbler but it&#39;s been five years.</p>

<h3>The obvious issues...</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve got to be honest: I don&#39;t mind stickers depending on the pieces and where we do place afterwards. This is my third UCS-style set and I do believe stickers should no longer be a thing for the info plaque. That being said, the printing can also get &quot;wasted&quot; somehow so it&#39;s a double-edged sword. Some of them were effectively difficult to place such as the gas tank caps taken from a London Bus (the film was shot at Pinewood Studios in London). Thankfully, the Bat-logos on the tire caps and the one-by-one studless&nbsp;round piece was also printed and, if you&#39;re lucky, you may get an extra one.</p>

<p>The info plaque does feature some infos we may already know about the Batmobile but the insignia being black and white seems to represent the 1992 logo used for merchandise although the width of the logo is proportionate to the 1989 logo.</p>

<h3>The instructions book</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve got to appreciate what LEGO has done. You sure are getting a buildable toy (or a miniature replica) of a Batmobile but I honestly am happy with the instructions book. It goes beyond the UCS sets because instead of getting the usual cover, it is the original movie prop based on&nbsp;the studio photographs with the LEGO logo and the original golden Bat-symbol from 1989. A bit of trivia: the teaser poster only had the golden Bat-symbol back in 1989 without the title of the movie. I guess it was intended by LEGO to reproduce this teaser on the box and instructions book. As soon as you open the book, you get a close shot of the front of the set with the sources of the pictures as well as the product number and you get some words from the multiple people who collaborated on this project including Adam Grabovski&nbsp;who did work on The Tumbler released five years ago. For Adam tackling another giant Batmobile, this has to be quite the achievement. It does feel like a collectible book instead of a LEGO instructions book. You see more studio photos and shots from the movie as well as the blueprint (used by Oswald Cobblepot in Batman Returns with his plan to hack the car).</p>

<p>While I did appreciate the stylized Waynetech/Applied Science Division confidential files approach of the 5-books set, it didn&#39;t have any comment or details about the process of making of the Tumbler and how it was conceived&nbsp;by Christopher Nolan&#39;s team or the discussion between LEGO and DC/Warner. Oddly enough, The Tumbler was released 10 years after Batman Begins began filming and the first thing that was designed by Chris Nolan and Nathan Crowley was the vehicle. For Burton, the Batmobile&nbsp;was also very important (possibly the second thing they designed, the first being the body armor). I feel LEGO has finally made a real, proper UCS set outside of the Star Wars line and it is to be commended. Sure, some sets have been UCS&nbsp;and not entirely up to the line or some non-UCS&nbsp;did feel like actual items destined for collectors but judging the information and dedication to the source material, this is on the same level as Star Wars.</p>

<h3>The construction</h3>

<p>Over the span of two days, the construction took around 15-16 hours and I really, really wanted to take my time and enjoy the process and see how the designers did make this thing hold up. After building the initial frame, I did get a good impression of how long the set was going to be. Assembling the steering component was possibly the most difficult because one mistake can really cause anybody some trouble. This set being marketed for adults and older teenagers, this is where it makes sense.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When the main mechanisms are getting assembled, you really have to pay extra attention to the amount of stuff and studs because a single piece, once again, can lead to further mistakes and it did happen to me as I&#39;ve had to move certain pieces to another stud or two just because I was getting a little too ahead. That includes the two-by-one tiles. Setting up the gribbling&nbsp;for the exposed mechanical parts of the car was actually interesting because of the initial experience I&#39;ve had on the Y-Wing which add a bit of depth and it&#39;s even more interesting to see how they made the air intakes work even though they&#39;re not exactly like the movie prop in terms of geometry form. Bear in mind that a lot of concession had to be made to keep the authenticity of the curves and shapes.</p>

<p>During the entire process, I felt like I was building a mechanical castle. In fact, I could say I felt like building something straight out of Castlevania&nbsp;until I place the sub-assemblies consisting of the body. Perhaps the most interesting piece was indeed the windshield. It IS a printed piece trying to mimic the actual windshield of the car and, once again, the concessions still make it interesting to look at.</p>

<p>The amount of sub-assembly on top of another one on top of an extra one can make you crazy but that&#39;s how much they really tried to keep the authenticity. The biggest sub-assembly was what could be the trunk of the car with the extra vent and this is where the focus may need to be because it&#39;s almost impossible to perfectly recreate the possible angles. But unlike The Tumbler from 2014, you don&#39;t have flaps or wings that could fall off as everything is properly attached. I don&#39;t even want to spoil the experience for you.</p>

<h3>A bit of controversy?</h3>

<p>I think it&#39;s fair to say that LEGO was marketing the set for a very specific crowd: adults or actual fans of the 1989 movie. That being said, I&#39;m still shocked that LEGO went ahead to add the machine guns function as they have been tried to avoid realism. That said, the machine guns only lift up or down with a rotating mechanism tied to the afterburner. With the amount of stuff from Star Wars and the multiple attempts at authenticity, It&#39;s fair to say that LEGO, despite being a toy company, knows its limits but I think, much like Batman in most occasions, a line is probably being crossed.</p>

<h3>The complete model</h3>

<p>Some mistakes can be seen if you know your Batmobiles. Some intakes are clearly absent and some of the angles aren&#39;t exactly matching the original prop including the nose of the turbine. The wings are obviously a little wrong but for what they tried to achieve considering the limits of LEGO as a toy company and the pieces they create, I do believe they made an outstanding product. It is obviously heavy which means that transporting this set could prove difficult. However, the overall sturdiness and the Technic assembly really makes it hold together like a dream. Sure there are flimsy parts such as the gribbling&nbsp;or the pedals early in the construction process.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the concessions they made, I&#39;m glad they went even further with authenticity including the sliding windshield component as it does much like the prop. The added turning mechanism is obviously limited and only serve as an added bonus. Despite some mistakes and, as I said, concession or even little gaps, this replica keeps the aggressive style of the prop and this is the best thing I can ask for. This is one set that no picture does justice to the product. You really have to close in on the gaps to see the small mistakes regarding the colors.</p>

<p>My favorite point of view has to be from the back even though all views are, in my opinion, exceptional. The red lights, the exhaust pipes and the massive afterburner as well as the vents on the dorsal part of the vehicle and the wings forming the &quot;bat&quot; shape of the vehicle really shows the importance of maintaining the angles or even the sacrifice of the product being a brick-built toy. The display stand with the rotating mechanism is excellent but the info plaque could have been a separate build or attached to the belfry component with the minifigs.</p>

<h3>And the minifigs?</h3>

<p>I would have bought this Batmobile regardless of the minifigs but I&#39;m appreciative of the work they&#39;ve done on Batman. The material used for the cowl and cape and the idea of making the minifig unable to turn the head is quite funny. Removing the cowl does show the torso print missing the symbol so it&#39;s like when Bruce Wayne puts on the actual suit. Even one of the face prints is interestingwith his smile. It&#39;s not as obvious as the one used in other sets like the LEGO Batman movie series but it does mimic some of the expressions of Michael Keaton in specific scenes such as the Axis Chemicals action scene (his first meeting with Jack Napier and the bandit commenting on the nice outfit of the vigilante). The headpiece is often seen on other Batman minifigs. Obviously no leg prints but that&#39;s fine. Possibly the most awesome detail is that the symbol on the cowl piece is 100% the original symbol from the 1989 movie&#39;s costume. Obviously, Batman has appeared in 1939 in Detective Comics #27</p>

<p>Vicki Vale is&nbsp;the least impressive minifigure but still stands out thanks to the dress mimicking her scenes from the Museum and her being rescued as she did sit inside the car. She does have an angry expression on one of the prints which is a bit surprising yet welcoming for the character played by Kim Basinger. She does have her camera and it makes a ton of sense because she&#39;s a journalist... or photograph in the case of this movie. Leg prints included so that makes this rendition of Vicki quite special... especially since it is the first minifigure for this character first presented in 1948 (Batman #49). The character was meant to be blonde based on Bob Kane&#39;s work but there was a mistake in the printing which made her red-headed.</p>

<p>Both heads for Batman and Vicki aren&#39;t exclusive unfortunately as I mentionned.</p>

<p>Except for the fedora, this Joker minifigure is technically unique. Usually appearing in dark purple, this one is no exception but his overalls closely matches the one in most Joker scenes from the movie down to the leg prints. One small element being absent is the tissue under the flower (used to wipe the flesh colored make-up in that famous handshake scene, in fact he even has a different outfit in that scene). Even the tie is similar because there are dots on the original costume but they&#39;re difficult to see unless you&#39;re watching the movie in HD or Blu-Ray. As you may know, The Joker first appeared in 1940&#39;s Batman #1 and was co-created by Bill Finger and Jerry Robinson.</p>

<p>And what&#39;s with that stupid grin? Pretty much the best attempt to capture Jack Nicholson&#39;s facial expression which is quite the homage for the retired actor. The closest LEGO has reached to do a Nicholson-esque Joker was with the Steam Roller set from 2014 but now we do have THE Nicholson Joker and as an owner of the 2014&#39;s Tumbler, I can now put this Joker with Heath Ledger&#39;s.</p>

<p>The customized stand which represents the belfry of Gotham&#39;s Cathedral is quite nice with the addition of gargoyles.</p>

<h3>Price per piece and license</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s break this down, shall we? This set has around 3300 pieces. It has four giant tires, three unique mini-figures including Batman with a unique mold for the cowl, a display plaque with a sticker... and it is based on a franchise. This is quite the stuff.&nbsp;We&#39;re getting a $250 set ($300 in Canada). To me, and for the size of the finished product, I was honestly expecting this set to be around $400 in my country or maybe $450 considering the prices for other UCS sets and how crazy some playsets are overpriced. So let me repeat: this is a licensed product with 3300 pieces, a giant display model with three exclusive minifigs including an exclusive cowl mold for Batman. This is tremendous value and this is where I can actually applaud LEGO. Also the set is almost as big as its box.</p>

<p>Over the years, we have rightfully criticized LEGO for the prices of some of the sets. Most of the time, it&#39;s due to playability, license, minifigs, scale, exclusivity and more. Some sets have been the exception but I do wish to reiterate that this set, at its retail price, is definitely incredible. So let that sink in if you think you can afford it.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Before Star Wars, I was a Batman fan. LEGO got me into Star Wars as soon as the first sets were launched in 1999. It is surprising that more than than 25 years after building my first sets featuring kings, knights and castles, I get to build more complex sets. This Batmobile&nbsp;represents more than bricks. There&#39;s a personal value for me because I watched the animated series and the movies (even the bad ones).</p>

<p>Unlike The Tumbler which I felt was quite pricey for the amount of pieces and the box being way too big for the scale of the final product (even though I actually am proud to own it as a Batman fan), I&#39;ve none of those issues with the 1989 Batmobile. I expected it to be more expensive but that wasn&#39;t the case at all.</p>

<p>The building experience was excellent and partially difficult at the beginning but the final results and seeing the minifigs standing with the vehicle of a such a size is worth the detour. This is ONE set that I couldn&#39;t pass on and I hope that, if you get it, you take your time enjoying the experience as I did. Sure it does have some mistakes or omissions but I&#39;m actually happy with the final product.</p>

<p>This purchase decision is yours to make but it is a product that I can recommend to adult Batman fans, anybody who grew up with the 1989 movie (which I&#39;m sure a lot of people did) or any car lover. If you&#39;re a father or a mother and have a child growing up watching Batman or DC stuff who&#39;s old enough to play with fragile LEGO products, I hope you get the chance to build some parts together and enjoy it being displayed.</p>

"Havoc","2019-12-23T14:22:36.93Z","Best Batmobile is average at best.","<p>1989 Tim Burton&#39;s Batman is in my opinion best Batman movie ever despite some liberties taken with the story. And Batmobile from this movie is hands down best Batmobile Batman ever had. Therefore after seeing all those mediocre and weird attempts of recreating Batmobile in various sets I thought it wouldn&#39;t get a proper build by lego.</p>

<p>And then this set was announced and my hopes went up and...they fell down and smashed on sidewalk.</p>

<p>Although there are many great building techniques and some parts are done great (i.e. opening canopy, rear and machine guns) everything else pretty much sucks and it pains me greatly to write this about my favourite movie car.</p>

<p>&#39;Wings&#39; in the back are too thick and angles are wrong, slopes with fuel caps on them are weirdly angled (unnecessary, it could be done much better) and the gap between this slope and rest of the mudguard looks bad.</p>

<p>Air intakes on sides are sticking out WAY too much and they are oval instead of round (which also could be done much better)</p>

<p>Bricks attached at a certaing angle on the sides of canopy look weird and out of place considering car&#39;s overall shape.</p>

<p>Small air intakes in front of the canopy are a bit too wide but that&#39;s just a small detail.</p>

<p>Slopes that are making car&#39;s &#39;hood&#39; are making it look oval and it should be rounded. In a vehicle made in a scale that big this should be done right.</p>

<p>A small nitpick - steering wheel is way too small and it&#39;s column is too short.</p>

<p>And now comes the worst part - front. This iconic front was devastated by lego designers.</p>

<p>Overall front part is too short. Middle air intake should be made at a certain&nbsp;angle and &#39;plow&#39; below it should be longer. Those round bricks on the sides of it look weird and out of place.</p>

<p>Lights should be made at a way smaller angle which wouldn&#39;t be a problem if front had correct length. Also lights are too narrow.</p>

<p>There are no fins on the sides. The part on top of front lights is too thick and those &#39;cracks&#39; on sides look terrible.</p>

<p>Front should also be smooth and all those studs in front are making it look bad.</p>

<p>But the worst part in front is the furrow on top of mudguards.</p>

<p>Seriously, at this scale all this could be done MUCH better but I guess Lego is like movie studios now - quick quick, we have to release this before (put date in here) otherwise &#39;suits&#39; won&#39;t be pleased. And we get what we get - a serious drop in quality and for what price...</p>

<p>Also my set came with damaged stickers and lego&nbsp;customer service won&#39;t even reply to my complaint.</p>

<p>Not to mention promised free mini batmobile&nbsp;for every buy till 05.12 turned out to be another lie that they won&#39;t address either. Guess they assumed that only a handful of people will buy this and those 10 mini batmobiles they prepared will be enough.</p>

<p>For a set that costs 250 &euro; it&#39;s a scam. Big disappointment for me.</p>

"GrandInqusitor","2023-01-19T13:57:45.877Z","For my Darkest Night (9-th) set I got into Big trouble :D","<p>Still catching up on my reviews....</p>

<p>The day it&nbsp;arrived to my home as a used set with 3306 pieces I was afraid to actually start this set, because&nbsp;I don&#39;t have numbered bags to rely on.&nbsp;So one weekend I finally had time I poured all the pieces to the table and so 1,5 week journey started it took me total of 20+ hours for sure.</p>

<p><strong>Building/Parts: 5/5</strong></p>

<p>Building is awesome, its just uses so many different building techniques to achieve all the different curves of this magnificent beast, and it&#39;s few but cool functions.</p>

<p>My favourite parts of this build had to be how cockpit opens up and how side vents are created that really woke child in me while building those parts.</p>

<p>Parts there are like 4 tons of parts and lots and lots of black and after that there are still ton of black parts left but what do you expect from a Batmobile build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But I have to be hones I shed a tear at first when poured all the pieces from my used set to the table. I planned to build it during the weekend after all. So I took 1,5 weeks a lot of room.</p>

<p><strong>Aesthetics 5</strong></p>

<p>The sheer size of it the sculpting of body the functions it&#39;s perfect. I am just amazed that its translates to Lego so well. Good job guys. I love it on my shelf.</p>

<p>And these are my first mini figures they look cool I guess do not really know how to rate them Batman is the best looking in this set for sure.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 1</strong></p>

<p>Yeah you are not going to buy this to play well you can but not really stop lying to yourself. I will not consider this in my overall rating</p>

<p><strong>Value for money: 5</strong></p>

<p>Hey man used set for 230 euros 3300+ pieces 20 hours of fun building little bit heat at home all in all worth it.</p>

<p><strong>Overall: 5</strong></p>

<p>You can still get this masterpiece of lego with pretty good price, buy it used you just have prolonged fun. Specially recommended if you like presence on the shelf it will turn everybody eyes and will start talks around the room. Some think you are maybe bit childish but most be envy for you that you can still have fun.</p>

"Gelu8","2023-04-11T15:24:14.383Z","The Best Batman Set Ever","<p>If this isn&#39;t the consensus best Batman set ever, it&#39;s certainly in the top five or top three. When this was announced, it made headlines across not just pop culture news outlets but also car news outlets. The fact it was the 1989 Batmobile, arguably the most beloved one ever put to screen, was the icing on the cake.</p>

<p>You have a wonderful box and then another smaller box inside. This is also the only LEGO set released that has an instruction manual with the actual car pictured on the front cover.</p>

<p>Building this vehicle is an experience. It&#39;s almost as good as a large-scale Technic set. This car takes elements from Creator, Technic, and Creator Expert and puts them together. Techniques used are wide-ranging and complicated. At certain angles, you almost forget it&#39;s a LEGO set.</p>

<p>Of course, there&#39;s the unique minifigures. We have our first Batman figure in a long time that has a custom cowl, Vicky Vale, and a Joker figure all straight from the movie. To top that off, the figures stand on a custom gothic-style plinth.</p>

<p>Four years on, the car has aged wonderfully. It&#39;s still as imposing and impressive as it was in 2019. I&#39;m not sure how it could be improved. This set comes highly recommended for Batman fans, DC fans, car fans, and LEGO fans in general.</p>
