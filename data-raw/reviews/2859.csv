The Brickster stole your trophy, and you chase after him, he blasts off using a stolen spaceshuttle, you go to MARS, beat alians, and get the trophy. Freddie Fit (a guy in the crew) has a funny voice. Get the game, and you'll see what I mean. Me favorite team to beat is the Arctic Medics and the arctic Mechaniics and the Adventurer's pilots. YOu can even play as the other people once you've beaten them. I like playing as Johnny thuneder, Miss Pippen Read, and Bandage Bob. Flibberty Jibber.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"thedavid","2011-11-17T10:56:36.65Z","Great game","Yes, This time LEGO tried to make a FIFA Game in LEGO. They did a great job. the camera settings are OK, the moves are real. and this time you can´t get the ball out of the field. The characters are fun, but the names aren´t always good. I like the themes<div><br></div><div>-City</div><div>-Arctic</div><div>-Adventurers: the desert and the jungle</div><div>-Pirates</div><div>-Life on mars</div><div>-knight´s kingdom (version 1)</div><div>-western</div><div>One bad thing is that the standard controls could be better. You don´t have enough fingers for this game. you have to shoot, use power-ups, pass, sprint and do some special moves. The music is great and the graphichs are OK too.&nbsp;</div><div>Powerups:</div><div>- grab the bonus of the other team</div><div>- get the ball</div><div>-make the other team drunk</div><div>- make your team faster</div><div>- a powerfield, only for one player</div><div>- change the ball into a rocket</div><div>&nbsp;I think this game should be better for playstation or xbox, but still I really like it. If you find it you should buy it!</div>",TRUE,4,1,1,4,5
