The only thing what I don&#39;t like is the colorful inside of the Set, it is terrible colorful.</p>

<p>The value of the Set is personal and everyone who thinks to buy it has to think for themselves if they wants to spend so much money for this Set. I like it and I&#39;m happy with it.</p>

It got some frustrating parts, and you must pay close attention to the building guide cause it&#39;s easy to miss a part. I know that it is very big and lego had to make it out of as few pieces as possible, but it&#39;s a little loose, it is a bit frustrating moving it from a place to another.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Long story short it was my best building in my life but it could still be better. I am curious&nbsp;what future brings us later.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My one and only &#39;gripe&#39; is the inclusion of only 2 minifigs.&nbsp; Come on Lego for $700 it wouldn&#39;t have hit the P/L column too hard to toss a couple more in!</p>

<p>I do not recommend playing after the build. Some parts, especially the tantive iv,&nbsp;are fragile, bu it&#39;s perfect&nbsp;for displaying.</p>

"CaptainKindling","2020-10-10T10:29:32.297Z","I have brought peace, freedom, justice and security to my new Empire!","<p>Where to even start with this?&nbsp; While there have been some pretty impressive sized models released in the UCS and Masterbuilder series, at the time of writing only a mere handful have been immortalised in what can be considered colossal-sized Lego form.&nbsp; Coming in at almost 4800 pieces, the Star Destroyer Devastator is one of these.</p>

<p>As far as price per piece goes, the Star Destroyer has taken a little flack from the fans.&nbsp; The obvious comparison is the 2017 UCS Millennium Falcon, selling for the same price, arriving in the same sized box, but with a piece count a little over 7500.&nbsp; This might leave Star Destroyer buyers feeling a little shortchanged, but it honestly shouldn&#39;t.&nbsp; While the design of the Falcon lends itself to a lot of smaller pieces, the sleek lines of the Empire&#39;s trademark capital ship gives way to a stack of huge plates, with anything up to a 16x16 making up the bulk of the hull.</p>

<p>When you first open the box (as long as you&#39;ve followed the tabs and opened it on the right side) you&#39;ll be greeted by a sleek inner box containing the hefty instruction manual.&nbsp; Due to its sheer size it&#39;s ring-bound, and as is standard with UCS sets the first few pages are dedicated to facts about the ship itself, the Lego design process, and interviews with the design team.&nbsp; When opened up this instruction book takes up a lot of space, so you&#39;ll need a decent sized table to get to work on this.</p>

<p>Once past the instructions&nbsp;there are four inner boxes, which when stacked show an image of the Star Destroyer printed along the end.&nbsp; With the Falcon, each of these boxes carries a famous quote from the original trilogy about the iconic vessel, however there is nothing like this with the Star Destroyer.&nbsp; It&#39;s a bit of shame, and smacks slightly of favouritism towards the Rebellion, leaving us Empire fans feeling a little cold.</p>

<p>Within the boxes you&#39;ll find the build split into 19 sets of numbered bags (for example you may have 3 of bag &quot;5&quot; and 5 of bag &quot;8&quot; etc), as well as a handful of non-numbered bags containing the largest pieces of hull plating, engine housing and so on.&nbsp; Normally in a review I&#39;d now say &quot;It took me x hours to build&quot;, but not wanting to rush such an investment I did one set of numbered bags per day, stretching the build out across almost 3 weeks.&nbsp; If I had to hazard a guess I&#39;d say the days averaged out to an hour each, so you&#39;re looking at an 18-20 hour build process.&nbsp; The only sticker in the entire set is the data plaque, giving some interesting little tidbits of information on the ship.</p>

<p>The initial part of the build makes up the display stand and the skeleton of the ship.&nbsp; There are a lot of really interesting Technic pieces and guild techniques that go into making the backbone of the Star Destroyer, allowing the frame to not only take the weight of the rest of the build, but remain stable when moving the completed model.&nbsp; The stand itself may look a little flimsy, but also carries the weight well, and has a little flexibility which helps during movement.&nbsp; Again I draw a comparison to the Falcon, and point out that the Star Destroyer obviously has no landing gear, so the stand is an integrated part of the build and can&#39;t be removed without extreme difficulty once the build is even just half way done.&nbsp; This does mean you won&#39;t have a &quot;pure&quot; Star Destroyer model, and there will always be gaps in lower hull where the stand connects.&nbsp; In the grand scheme of things it&#39;s not a huge issue, and is just the price to pay for building a faithful replica of a ship which was never designed for anything but being suspended in space.</p>

<p>Once through that initial Technic build, the hull plates begin to come together in satisfyingly large sections.&nbsp; With my one-set-per-day building, each session ended with noticeably huge progress having been made since the previous one.&nbsp; There&#39;s a surprising amount of detail added to the larger hull plates to prevent them from simply being flat, featureless areas, but when you reach the command area and the bridge section, that&#39;s where the build really become incredible, with anything from ice skate blades to frying pans being used to ingeniously add extra levels of detail to the ship.</p>

<p>By the time you&#39;re finished, you have a 3 foot long monstrosity which really captures the might of the Empire.&nbsp; The detail, as mentioned, is brilliant, and the set even comes with a Tantive IV and a single TIE fighter, which mostly feel like they&#39;re there to give the ship a sense of scale.&nbsp; The TIE sits in the docking bay on the underside of the ship, while the Tantive IV is designed to fly alongside using a clear rod.&nbsp; You do have the option, however, of removing the rod from the Tantive IV and fitting it into the docking bay alongside the TIE, which I&#39;ve done simply because I think it looks a lot tidier.&nbsp; When relocating it will require both hands to carry, either carefully picking the set up from underneath or removing the detachable top section to access the carrying handle (which will still require a second hand to stabilise due to balance issues).&nbsp; The biggest issue you&#39;ll have at this point is finding a place to display the Star Destroyer, and preferably somewhere it won&#39;t attract a lot of dust!&nbsp; For me personally, it sits on top of one of my Lego display cabinets, looming menacingly over the rest of the collection... and unfortunately collecting dust as it goes.&nbsp; I&#39;ve just had to accept the fact that dusting Lego is now a regular part of my housework.</p>

<p>So the big downside for this set comes in the playability category, but in fairness a UCS set of this size really isn&#39;t meant for playing.&nbsp; As mentioned, the display stand is integrated, so &quot;swooshing&quot; the ship around isn&#39;t really an option, although the size and weight would have been an issue on this front even without the stand.&nbsp; Comparing again to the Falcon, unlike the former this doesn&#39;t have any kind of interior.&nbsp; The entire space under the hull is dedicated to the Technic skeleton holding the ship together, so anyone hoping to be able to pop the top off and see the recreation of the Star Destroyer bridge will be sorely disappointed.&nbsp; The turbolasers along the sides and upper hull can swivel, but that is the entirety of this sets playability.</p>

<p>The minifigure selection with this set is again disappointing.&nbsp; The Imperial Officer and Crew Member included may be exclusives to this set, and the printing on them is very nice, but compared to the Falcon&#39;s lineup of iconic characters, getting 2 generic nobodies is certainly a let down.&nbsp; Considering the presence of the Tantive IV shows that this set is really supposed to be recreating that memorable opening scene to A New Hope it would have been nice to include an exclusive Vader variant, or even one of the lesser known Imperial officers on board such as Nahdonnis Praji or Daine Jir.</p>

<p>Those nitpicks aside, if you&#39;re a fan of the Empire and have the money to spare, this set will make a truly incredible addition to your collection.&nbsp; The build process is tremendous fun, and the sheer size and detail on the ship are awe-inspiring.&nbsp; Top marks to Lego.</p>

"Unredeemable","2023-01-28T21:04:06.473Z","Great Star Wars Fan Set for Adults","<p>As a fan of the original Star Wars Trilogy this set is most impressive. The sheer size and scope of this set is satisfying to build and admire.&nbsp; The build experience is excellent save for some repetition on building sections that are almost identical.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only disappointing thing about&nbsp;the parts is the lack of figures/unique character figures that go with the set. That being said, this set is by no means meant for playability. So including more&nbsp;mini-figures would be&nbsp;a waste.</p>

<p>This set is massive and not friendly to move.&nbsp; Just getting it from where I built it to its final display spot was a challenge.&nbsp; Highly recommend following the instructions on where to lift this set.</p>

<p>I still love this set, and it is quite the gem&nbsp;in my collection so far.&nbsp;</p>

"GeorgeArt16","2023-03-10T20:57:21.18Z","Impressive Display, Unforgettable Experience","<p>Months ago I decided to treat myself to this set, and let me say it looks incredible. As someone who is fascinated with the Empire and their angular ships, this flagship is replicated incredibly.</p>

<p>With over 4700 pieces, incredible detail is provided, especially around the rear thrusters and equator. Many tiny pieces like frying pans and the Mjolnir element create amazing greebling details and make the giant ship more breathtaking. The ship is built with locking plates connected to an intricate sword-shaped technic skeleton. Two of the outer plates can be removed to carry the ship by grabbing the technic structure, but I would move it around as little as possible as it is quite heavy when built.</p>

<p>The display stand is built into the bottom of the ship, so displaying it without the stand is not possible without modification, and even then I wouldn&#39;t recommend it. Again, it&#39;s very heavy and leaving the ship freestanding is just asking for it to fall over. The display plaque&nbsp;shows a render of the UCS model with some information about the flagship in canon, including its length, manufacturer, and armaments. It looks sleek and is uniform with the rest of the UCS plaques.</p>

<p>Overall, I think I spent about 10 or 11 hours across two days building the ship, and connecting the large plates and the command tower is very rewarding. Some parts are repetitive as the ship is symmetrical across its length, but it was still a fun building experience.</p>

<p>While 2 minifigures seems underwhelming (and it is), the dual moulded boots on the officer look great and the crewmember&#39;s printed arms&nbsp;capture great detail. The model also includes a micro Tantive-IV build, which looks great when displayed on the clear arm piece though parts of it are fragile. Personally, I don&#39;t have it displayed as it can get knocked off easily, but it does look nice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since me buying the set, it has retired, though it is currently available second-hand for lower than its RRP and if you have the capacity, I would definitely recommend 75252 - Imperial Star Destroyer. It&#39;s a lengthy, but fun build that really makes you appreciate the scale of the Devastator-class Destroyer.&nbsp;</p>
