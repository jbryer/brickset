<p>I was very excited when I finally saw the press release of the set, after months of rumours.</p>

<p>As with the Disney castle, my inner Disney fandom urged me to get this set. That was,&nbsp;until I heard&nbsp;the price. I was expecting a D2C priced at no more than $250 USD, and to see that its actual price was $329.99 was outrageous, and it kind of felt like a joke.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am no stranger to the &quot;Disney tax&quot; on lego sets, but on this set, it killed my need to get the set.</p>

<p>Of course, a price-per-part ratio wouldn&#39;t be as effective and make justice to this set, since it contains a lot of large pieces, as is the case with trains; but, still, the price didn&#39;t live up to the hype of the set, at least in my opinion-&nbsp;after all, I don&#39;t have over $300 just lying around.</p>

<p>I eventually got it&nbsp;at a discount on&nbsp;last year&#39;s Black Friday sale. I was very pleased with my purchase, and still am today, since it was 30% off, had double VIP&nbsp;points and got the Christmas tree promotion on top of that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I got around to building the set on Christmas Day, and it was an enjoyable experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To try to sum up a little, I&#39;ll make a pros and cons list, and will give a brief conclusion afterwards.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Good addition if you have the Disney Castle</li>
	<li>Very nice display piece</li>
	<li>Has some play value</li>
	<li>Exclusive Goofy minifigure</li>
	<li>Includes a Powered-Up motor</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Relies heavily on stickers</li>
	<li>High price</li>
	<li>Includes only five minifigures</li>
	<li>Does not include a remote</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The Disney train and station is a very nice set, which I&#39;m glad to have on my collection, but it definitely isn&#39;t worth the full price of $329.99. The lack of a remote limits playability and certainly decreases value, and the inclusion of a motor isn&#39;t&nbsp;necessary, and without it, the price could drop to&nbsp;a more reasonable $299, after all, my set doesn&#39;t even use it, since I have it on display alongside the Disney Castle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would love to see more Disney parks sets in the future, and there is a lot of inspiration inside them, so I hope Lego will take a more price-sensitive approach in the future since a market for these sets&nbsp;clearly exists.&nbsp;</p>
