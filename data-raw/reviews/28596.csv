"Master_Wu","2019-03-20T01:40:49.38Z","Fantastic Fire Atv","<p>This small car is a fun and easy build. It has room for the driver in the front and clips in the back to hold the ax and fire extinguisher. The black rail piece also comes off and can be used as a road block. The minifigure is fantastic because he has highly detailed legs and torso. His ax looks very realistic with the red paint and the silver tip.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I recommend this set especially&nbsp;for young builders.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This was my 3rd build. It was far smaller piece count than any others I have tried. This was the easiest build yet. No complications. I love the ax.&nbsp;</p>

The Fire ATV is for the Fire Sub-Theme of LEGO City and is really fun.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Extremely fun model to build.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">New Fire Axe accessory in a cheap set.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Decent Minifigure with good printed detailing.</li>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Difficult to find at retail outside of the United States due to Toys&rsquo;-R-Us closing in most areas. Can be found in Canada there and at Wal-Mart. International collectors may have harder times finding it.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It should be noted that this Polybag was given away with purchase on LEGO Shop@Home during January. So the set wasn&rsquo;t that difficult to find and purchase at the beginning of the year. The set is great and features a nice little model. I&rsquo;d recommend getting a few, especially if you&rsquo;re interested in the new fire axe accessory.</p>

<p>This set comes in a polybag with normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some nice pieces in this set.&nbsp; The new axe piece is amazing. The silver handle and red head and silver edge make this such a great new piece. You also get a black front fender and a black handle as well. The total piece&nbsp;count for the set is 39. Overall a nice piece haul for this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Firefighter:</strong></p>

<p>The firefighter is a really nice figure to get. He has great printing. He has a red fire helmet and a single sided head. He has a couple grease marks on either side of his head and a brown goatee and a smile on his face. He has printing on both sides of his torso. He has a green and silver stripes on the center of his torso with a belt, two straps and a gauge. He also has printing on his legs with two pockets and green and silver stripes. He has&nbsp;the axe and a white fire extinguisher as his accessories.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a really nice Lego city polybag. The ATV&nbsp;looks amazing. The front fender really adds to the look of it. You have two clips on the back for the axe and fire extinguisher. The firefighter has great printing and detail on it. I recommend this set to anybody who is a fan of Lego city. If you aren&#39;t a fan this isn&#39;t a must-have, but would still be a nice addition to anybodies Lego collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
