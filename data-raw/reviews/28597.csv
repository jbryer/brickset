"Your_Future_President","2019-03-24T20:30:44.09Z","What a pieceful set. ","<p>I received this little set for Valentine&rsquo;s Day which seemed appropriate (for obvious reasons). Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at it.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigure:</h3>

<p>Emmet is the prime character in the Lego Movie series which is echoed in the fact that he is included in almost every set of the series. This version is not different from others in this wave, barring of course his head. His print seems battered from the tough life in Apocalypsburg, as shown in the film.&nbsp; His head includes a smiling face and a determined face on the rear, the latter of which&nbsp;was very nice as that specific expression is somewhat rare. His hairpiece is the same as from 2014.</p>

<h3>Build:</h3>

<p>The heart is actually very important in the film, and it is represented accurately here. As opposed to other polybags, this set includes many actual bricks, instead of the usual plates. One thing that I found interesting is that the pattern found on the front of the heart does NOT continue onto the back. &nbsp;I found this quite odd as it could easily have been; presumably, this was done for stability, which the model is pretty stable.</p>

<h3>Verdict:</h3>

<p>This set was definitely a great and fun build, and I recommend this to anyone. &nbsp;The Emmet figure is great and he can hold the heart (very precariously) if you position it just right. Otherwise he can just sit right on top. &nbsp;If you see it, pick it up! You won&rsquo;t be disappointed. &nbsp;Thanks for your time!</p>

<p>The building experience would&#39;ve been a 1/5, had it not been for the movie. The parts are mediocre. There is no playability. The price is ok, but not very worth it due to Emmet coming in most of the &quot;The Lego Movie 2: The Second Part&quot; sets.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-02-06T13:03:21.12Z","A Solid Build for a Small Set","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #30340 Emmet&rsquo;s Piece Offering:</b> The LEGO Movie 2 The Second Part has been released on Blu-Ray/DVD and Wal-Mart has an exclusive giveaway with their Blu-Ray release. This Polybag was available at retail much earlier in the year, but now you can get it free with the movie. Is it a set worth picking up? Let&rsquo;s cover the pros and cons and then final thoughts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Nice free item with purchase of move.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Solid looking model which works great and looks very close to the in-movie model.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Emmet Minifigure included.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Decent price-per-piece ratio.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">No accessories for Emmet.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Does not include alternate build for the parts, which anyone who has seen the movie would agree is sorely missing here.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I like this set. It is a very solid chunky model that works great. I like its use of colours and elements to create a very impressive looking heart shaped brick-built model. It stands out also as it adds more pieces you can use in your Queen Whatevra&rsquo; builds. The inclusion of Emmet is a nice touch, I think the only thing wrong with this set overall is that you need to buy the movie at Wal-Mart to get it. (I am not a fan of Wal-Mart honestly.) I&rsquo;d recommend picking this up if you can find it, it&rsquo;s a great little set and a really nice element of the film in set form. Highly recommended.</p>
