<p>It&#39;s branded as the &quot;Lego Movie 2&quot; set, but have literally nothing to do with the film &ndash;&nbsp;this model doesn&#39;t show up in any form, if I&#39;m not mistaken, so&nbsp;Emmet&#39;s &quot;scratches&quot;&nbsp;seem&nbsp;strange in a set that doesn&#39;t have any postapocalyptic vibe and can be easily put in Lego City.</p>

<p>It&#39;s obvious this set was designed&nbsp;with the multiple models in mind and not one of them feels like a main, with the strange use of pieces&nbsp;or some parts sticking out. The racing car looks the best, IMHO, and I&#39;m usually cold to the Lego cars, but this one is pretty distinct and unique looking;&nbsp;the exo-suit is awesome, just because it&#39;s an&nbsp;exo-suit. BTW, I didn&#39;t know that attaching non-wheels to the axle was legal.</p>

<p>Pieces included are&nbsp;variable mishmash, far from the basics. I especially love&nbsp;black and yellow stripe flat tiles, introduced in the &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; theme,&nbsp;which never were put in the set so small and might&nbsp;be the most desirable thing about this polybag.</p>

<p>Also, I must add that&nbsp;the model is back-heavy and prone to&nbsp;topple over.</p>

<p>This set represents the last of the polybags I would get from the LEGO Movie 2 line-up. However, it is the one I wanted the most as I did not yet have an Emmet figure to add to my collection. How is it as a set though?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Contents:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>It being a polybag set the contents are simple. Just a bunch of parts and a fold-out sheet with the instructions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interestingly, it is a 3 in 1, though just like the MetalBeard polybag we have to go online to get the remaining instructions.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>After looking carefully at the 3 in 1 options in the set I settled on making the Mech from the parts provided. I do not regret this choice in the slightest as the end result was stellar for so few parts. My children in particular loved the fact that they could pose the Mech fairly dynamically. I appreciated the 1x2 printed tile pieces also. Very well impressed with how much character such few pieces can produce.</p>

<p><b>The Minifigure:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, it is Emmet. I like his expressions. His prints are quite good as well. His construction suit is worn out but his name badge and overall personality remain almost the same as what we saw from the 1st LEGO Movie. The only downside to him is the white area around his collar is not quite opaque enough. The orange beneath the piece peeks through and it gives his shirt a strange half-finished look. Overall though he is great.</p>

<p><b>The Completed Model:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For me Emmet was over shadowed by his little Mech. It is really fun and watching my kids play with it was eye-opening. It truly is a good thing in a small package. The arms hinge up and down, the legs move forward and back and the &quot;ankles&quot; also hinge up and down. With some small modifications and adding just a few simple pieces of your own, you can probably get his waist to twist and make him more sure-footed but out-of-the-bag, this is great!&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of the three polybags I got I think I like this one the most. The Mech in particular really sealed the deal. If you want an Emmet I would say this one is great. The included pieces are useful for detailing and the printed yellow tiles can work great in other construction dioramas and original creations. Pretty good deal if you can still snag him for close to original retail.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">3-in-1 Model options allow for Construction Vehicle, Car and Mech builds.</li>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Hard to Find at Retail.</li>

	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Main Model is rather Top Heavy for a Construction Vehicle.</li>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This particular set is a nice if somewhat limited offering. The models are all fairly interesting, while Emmet is a decent figure to include in the set. I think the fact that you have a hard time finding it at Retail and the construction vehicle likes to topple over when playing with it. I&rsquo;d recommend this for a decent surprise gift, but if you&rsquo;re only looking to get a few sets from the Theme it&rsquo;s pretty safe to skip. Mildly Recommended.</p>
