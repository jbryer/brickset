The brickster steals the trophy after the frst part of the game. And then you have two more parts in the game. Each field is a different theme.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Shadow_Crawler","2008-10-05T08:53:39.467Z","Good, but boring","This game is kind of boring (like most of soccer games), but the story mode is fine enough.

In Story Mode, you can compose your team from players taken from the team you have defeated. Your mission is to capture brickster who have stolen your trophy. You will catch him on Mars.

Pros:
Exciting Story Mode

Cons:
After Story Mode is finished, this game will be boring
