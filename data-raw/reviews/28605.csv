"Minifig290","2019-04-16T22:22:04.81Z","A Great Little Entertaining Set","<p>Hello all, today I&#39;ll be looking at a 2019 polybag the Sky Police Jetpack that has 33 parts and was available at Target in the US for $3.99 and in the UK it was a free make and take build at selected The Entertainer stores in mid April, if this set is or would be available it would probably retail for &pound;4 giving this set a price per part of 12p/c.</p>

<p>Let take a look at this poly.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This is one of very few polybags that include two minifigures, it includes a classic cop and robber combo so lets start by looking at our hero cop.</p>

<p><strong>Cop</strong></p>

<p>The female cop has the 2019 Sky Police uniform in the nice baby blue colour, her torso has the police vest with the logo and 3 pockets, on the back of her torso her vest continues with a &quot;POLICE&quot; printed at the back. Her her facial expression is very smug and happy with lipstick on her lips, obviously, she also has her left eyebrow raised. Finally her helmet is the common white hat with trans brown visor.</p>

<p><strong>Crook</strong></p>

<p>Now our bad guy crook, he has a common sky police and prison island prison jumpsuit with lines on the legs and torso with the numbers &quot;86753&quot; on the lft side of the shirt with the top of his jumpsuit being all messy. Now the most interesting part of this figure to me is his face print that has a headset microphone next to his annoyed mouth and angry raised eyebrows, finally he has a dark red knit cap that has only been in 8 sets so far.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>There are two little extra side builds for the figures a set of handcuffs and a walki-talki with a red joystick that represents a controller for the drone in the set.</p>

<p><strong>Builds</strong></p>

<p>There are two main builds the first one is the jetpack that has two angled plates that is connected with a 1x2 trans blue plate and on each sie of that plate is a 1x2 clip plate that ha sa light saber hilt that represents the jets for the pack. To connect this jetpack on the back of the police officer is a new vest that goes on the neck of the minifigure with a 2x2 stud area for the pack to go on.</p>

<p>Also there is a drone build that is a very simple build, it has two rotor blades on each side of the drone and also attached to the body of the drone is a 1x2 green clip plate that has a 1x2 $100 bill tile on.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Now for a small cheap (free) polybag this is quite good, i love the figures and the build are though small and simple are effective. If this was a easy retail set i would recommend it as a easy pick up, it is unique and can give a few hours of entertainment also it would inspire some role playing with the set.</p>

<p><strong>Pros - </strong>Great figures, nice builds, provides entertainment, worth the price, easy to build</p>

<p><b>Cons - </b>No phenomenal parts, could be easier to obtain</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s dive right in.</p>

<h2>Building experience</h2>

<p>The building process is short and simple, I managed to build the two main components (the thug&#39;s drone and the officer&#39;s jetpack) without even opening the instruction pamphlet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instruction sheet is in the typical format for a polybag, there is nothing special about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The following image shows all the spare parts as well as the cover of the instruction sheet. As you can see, you get a second part of handcuffs in case you break or lose the other pair or if you need to complete another arrest scene, as well as a&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/74335/mini-antenna-ass-red-bla"">mini red antenna assembly</a>, another dark helmet visor and a&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4539481/light-sword-shaft"">lightsaber hilt</a>.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>As I mentioned previously, this set contains 2 Minifigures, which is rather unusual for a polybag and comes with plenty of accessories, such as handcuffs, remote control (made up of a&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6170545/walkie-talkie"">walkie talkie&nbsp;</a>and a small, red antenna assembly) for the thug&#39;s drone and the money case (made up of a&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4295260/flat-tile-1x2-dec-100"">100 Dollar bill plate</a>&nbsp;on top of a&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4542391/plate-1x2-w-stick"">green 1x2 plate with a stick</a>). The Jetpack is a more substantial accessory and theoretically the centrepiece of this set (since it carries the name), so I will talk about it in the &quot;Completed build&quot; section.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, is the female police officer. She is wearing the new, 2019 baby blue uniform with the police bullet-proof vest on top with the gold badge on the front and the white &quot;POLICE&quot; text on the back. Her torso is printed on both sides. Her legs/ pants match the colour of the uniform and have utility belts printed on the front side. Like every other female Minifigure, she is wearing red lipstick. The smug look on her face and the raised eyebrow make her seem really self-confident. She is also wearing a standard white helmet with a dark transparent visor.</p>

<p>The second and final Minifigure included in this set is the bad guy, the one our self-confident officer is supposed to capture and take to prison. I&#39;m talking about the escaped convict, criminal or crook. There is not much special about him. He is wearing the common, refreshed, Sky Police/ Prison Island convict jumpsuit with dark grey lines on the white torso (the torso has this print on both sides) and legs. Apart from that, his torso has the number &quot;86753&quot; printed on the upper left side and the neck collar of his buttoned convict shirt has this messy look. His face has a microphone printed next to his mean and confident looking smile. Finally, he is wearing a pretty uncommon,&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6113985/mini-pixie-cap"">dark red knit cap</a>.</p>

<h2>The completed model</h2>

<p>Apart from the 2 Minifigures, this polybag also contains a jetpack for our hero cop and a drone stealing a money suitcase, remotely controlled by the crook.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The drone is a quite simple build. The two black propellers on either side are attached to the dark red body with&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4581225/plate-2x1-w-holder-vertical"">dark grey 2x1 plates with vertical holders&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6261355/plate-1x2-w-vertical-schaft"">dark grey 1x2 plates with vertical shafts</a>. The bottom of the drone consists of one&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4159007/plate-2x2"">orange 2x2 plate</a>, which also acts as the landing gear of our drone. Apart from that, the drone also has a claw, a&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6028812/plate-1x2-w-1-horizontal-snap"">medium grey 1x2 plate with a horizontal snap</a>, with which it can steal the money case.</p>

<p>The police jetpack is the central model in this set, even if the build is very rudimentary. It only consists of 8 parts. The wing consists of two 2x3 white angled plates, one towards the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4179875/left-plate-2x3-w-angle"">left&nbsp;</a>and the other to the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4179874/right-plate-2x3-w-angle"">right</a>, held together by a&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6240215/plate-1x2"">1x2 transparent blue plate</a>. Medium grey&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4539481/light-sword-shaft"">lightsaber shafts</a>&nbsp;are attached with to either end of the wings with&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4535737/plate-2x1-w-holder-vertical"">white 2x1 plates with vertical holders</a>&nbsp;to act as jets. This whole wing assembly is then attached to a new component, relesead in 2019: a&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6248533/mini-armour-w-knobs-no-1"">black &quot;mini armour with 4 knobs&quot;</a>, which can then be attached to the cop Minifigure.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>This set has plenty of play value, especially considering the low price. Kids could have the female cop Minifigure chase the money-stealing drone back to the evil crook for hours, or even enact larger pursuits using other City sets. For a collector, this set holds value, as it comes with quite a few useful accessories as well as with 2 Minifigures which can be easily integrated into a larger City scape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is also the possibility that Lego might offer this set for free with larger purchases, making it even easier to obtain, however, I noticed that not all Lego brand stores in my city have it for sale, so we shall wait and see.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, I enjoyed this little set and it gets my recommendation.</p>
