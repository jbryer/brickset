<p>If you have seen&nbsp;the movie than you know what set is about.If you don&#39;t know,Rex and Emmet landed on first Systar system planet and got ambushed by bunch of this cute plantimals.Rex was attacked by bunch of this and this one or is favourite&nbsp;to the designers or easiest to build.</p>

<p>CONNECIONS</p>

<p>Don&#39;t know if you have realised,but this set has connection with 3 other sets:Rex&#39;s Rex-treme offroader,Rex&#39;s Rexplorer&nbsp;and Rexcelsior,because that is on same planet. If you haven&#39;t realised,this same plantimal monster and Rex have appeared in Rex-treme&nbsp;offroader. Besides for shiney&nbsp;parts and magenta plant leaves,it is nothing special. And by the way,only difference between this plantimal&nbsp;and one in offroader&nbsp;are four orange leaves appearing only in this set.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s get on Rex. Looking on print,this version has no difference to the one in offroader,except for face printing. One of his faces is this smile you can see on official pictures.Other one is dangerous smile.And my favourite&nbsp;thing is that he has comically oversized gun. Infact,I hve weight it and gun is HEAVIER THAN MINIFIGURE!</p>

<p>PROS</p>

<p>-it is good display piece</p>

<p>-you get very nice figure of Rex</p>

<p>-fun build</p>

<p>-if you don&#39;t have account on LEGO webside,it is very cheap</p>

<p>CONS</p>

<p>-hard to imagine a scene for play</p>

<p>OVERALL</p>

<p>It is very nice and good set.If aviable&nbsp;in you&#39;r&nbsp;LEGO store,don&#39;t wait and buy it.</p>

"DutchFlyer","2019-03-09T08:23:54.073Z","Cute and presumably very evil","<p>This set is (currently) a gift with purchase in&nbsp;the Lego (online) store. It is a fun little build, with great use of parts and fantastic colourful parts.</p>

<p>The build is quick and fun. The pieces are the main attraction: the fancy colored sparkling dish and&nbsp;cone, the brightly coloured palm leaf and crab, the orange leaf. All are lovely.</p>

<p>Rex is well done, nice detail on the legs,&nbsp; He has two expressions, none of them friendly though. I like his unshaven look. The plantimal looks deceptively lovely, but the claws of the crab serving as pincers show its evil side.</p>

<p>Overall this is a fun little set. Well done, lovely.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-02-06T13:05:16.56Z","A Fair Item at the Time for fans of the character.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #30460 Rex&rsquo;s Plantimal Ambush:</b> The LEGO Movie 2 features some interesting ideas for Polybags. This particular item was originally a Gift with Purchase, a year later it became available for sale on LEGO S&amp;H, which isn&rsquo;t common. I rarely see Polybags available for sale, I suspect the situation in 2020 changed up some of how things were sold. Either way, is this a set worth tracking down?</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Two characters included.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Cheapest price for a Rex Minifigure.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Buildable plant monster fun to display and fun to play with.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Light purple crab element found in this set.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Hard to find.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">No unique elements to the set, most of this Polybag is a re-pack of models and characters from the larger Rex sets.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Should have included two plant monsters.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I enjoyed picking this up on sale, as I do like The LEGO Movie 2 sets and haven&rsquo;t managed to get many of them yet. That being said I feel this Polybag could have offered more, either more to build with a second more unique plant monster, or even a printed baby raptor in the dark blue colouring to go with Rex. I would only recommend this set for some parts and the Rex Minifigure if you&rsquo;re not interested in getting any of the larger sets for his character. It&rsquo;s also great if you want an army of light purple crabs. Overall. Somewhat Recommended.</p>

<p>Comes in a normal polybag with the normal size instructions that you get in polybags. Instructions are clear and easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get a lot of cool and unique parts with some different colors. You get a lot of plants parts. You get 5 orange leafs and a pink palm leaf. You also get an pink crab and a purple sparkle neon&nbsp;dish and cone as well. The total piece count is 32.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p>Rex is the only figure in this set. He is armed with a double barrel gun. Gun is a little big and bulky, but still works for his character. Has a double sided head. Has printing on both his body and legs, also a little on his arms as well. Overall a decent figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. Took me under a few minutes to build.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice polybag to get. The parts are great, especially for a polybag. Rex is a nice figure and the gun is not bad. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>
