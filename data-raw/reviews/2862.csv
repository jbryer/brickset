"SaintElsewhere","2008-10-02T19:32:29.217Z","Wow, I'm pretty sure I still have this...","I got this for my birthday lo those many years ago. I still remember it almost perfectly. I enjoyed playing around with the different activities and my favourite aspects were playing with the Creator mode and making my own characters. I think the best part of this from 7 year-old me's POV was that extremely friendly sounding minifigure guide who would always pop up and give you tips and was just always there. A true Lego classic. Only problem is that some bits were kind of difficult for 7 year-old me.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2012-05-03T04:48:43.313Z","LEGO Gear (Video Games/PC) - LEGO Creator: Harry Potter Review","<p>This game may be a little bit better than the original LEGO Creator videogame but it's still not my favourite one. In this game you're able to create your own scenes with parts and minifigs from the LEGO Harry Potter theme. The scene could look cool and you can also bring it to life if you want to. </p>

<h4>Pros</h4>

<ul><li>Nice way to build your favourite Hogwarts scene<br>
</li><li>You can bring your scene to life<br>
</li></ul>

<h4>Cons</h4>

<ul><li>Could be boring after a while<br>
</li></ul>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>All in all it's a great game to get and I would HIGHLY recommend you to
get this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and
Amazon for sure.</p>",TRUE,5,1,5,5,5
"Berrus_Brickus","2010-12-30T07:30:11.813Z","A Worthless Sequel (with a Sequel?)!","<p>Let's get right on to the Pros and Cons,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul>
<li>*First of many liscenced LEGO games 
<li>*Can create characters for all four houses (somthing Harry Potter Years:1-4 missed) 
<li>*Parts in the game are nice</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>*Pathetic sequel to the first LEGO Creator game (which was decent). 
<li>*Dumbledore wannabe woun't shut up (and nobody wants to see his bare chest) 
<li>*Can run out of space (to quote the beardless Dumbledore, ""Oops, looks like you've run out of space and can't put any more models in your world!"" 
<li>*The graphics for LEGO Island were better than this (and that is sad) 
<li>*Closes down alot 
<li>*Besides Hogwarts robes, only studios torsos can be used for you figure 
<li>*Disturbing how the minifigures legs wiggle in the chair 
<li>*Figures can't climb up stairs (They could in the original LEGO Creator game)</li></ul>
<h4>Neutral</h4>
<ul>
<li>*Not really a pro or a con, but I thought it was kind of funny how Pippin Reed (from the <em>Adventures, Orient Expedition, </em>and <em>Studios </em>themes) was present.</li></ul>
<p>In conclustion, don't bother with this game.&nbsp; If you are looking for a creator game, try the original, LEGO Creator, or LEGO Digital Designer (more specifically LEGO Universe mode).&nbsp; If a LEGO Harry Potter game is what you are looking for, the try the more recent one from TT games (LEGO Harry Potter: Years 1-4).</p>",TRUE,2,3,1,1,1
"TooMuchLEGO","2011-02-09T20:00:51.307Z","A fun game","<p>I remember getting this game a couple years ago...and still I now enjoy this game. This game has a really good minifigure creator- you can make Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw students in this game, which in real life they STILL haven't made (with the exception of Luna Lovegood).</p><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>The game has four worlds- Diagon Alley, Hogwarts (Interior and Exterior) and King's Cross. There is a surplus of stuff you can place in your worlds- stores, trains, trees, Hagrid's Hut, minifigures, stairs, and other stuff too. The game also has some fun Challenges- like Draco has Harry's Nimbus 2000, and Ron has to stop him.</p><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>Sometimes the game can be a little annoying- there's this little wizard who is a great and friendly guide, but sometimes he'll blurt somewhat annoying lines out there in the game,(CONGRATULATIONS! You just placed your first model into your world), and the game has a limit on how many models can be placed into your world (which is a bummer when you wanna make REAAAAALLY long train tracks. Oh well.</p><p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>But the&nbsp;game is a lot of fun when you forgive the faults, and can supply hours upon hours of fun.</p>",TRUE,4,1,4,5,4
