This version is shown in the first trailer, just after buying a coffee from the newly named, Coffee Unchained. He also has a phone playing the awesome remix playlist. He has a new hairstyle, well, just headphones, but, uh, new piece? I will have to end up getting two of this minifigure, just so I can give one of the phones to Star-lord. :)</p>

That isn&#39;t to say that this minifigure is bad, in fact , it&#39;s actually pretty good.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll just point out the worst thing about this figure first. The legs and torso are the same from most of the Lego Movie 2 sets that include Emmet , though the character doesn&#39;t have much variants to him compared to other characters , so it was pretty much inevitable to find the same torso and legs found in this figure. I would give Lego a pass in that regard , but if you get past the torso and the legs, this is a pretty &nbsp;good figure. The standouts of the figure are pretty much everything else other than the torso and legs. Things like the exclusive double-sided , extremely happy face prints , the exclusive printed tile of the phone (Which is a really Awesome exclusive accessory) and the plain white coffee cup , which isn&#39;t exclusive but still a pretty uncommon piece and nice to find in a cheap collectable minifigure. The best part of the figure is obviously the new mold introduced , the hair/headphones combo , which is a really useful&nbsp;piece and could easily be recolored and used for different minifigures.</p>

<p>While this isn&#39;t the best figure of The Lego Movie 2 series , it definitely is a fun figure who will be a fine addition to your collection. There&#39;s plenty to enjoy from this figure and is definitely worth picking up.</p>

Torn and frayed, Emmet has survived the worst that the Alien Invaders has had to offer and continues to smile away the day.</p>

<p>Featuring a new hair piece with headphones, a printed tile with cell phone set to Awesome, a coffee cup with no printing and two separate smiling expressions (one with eyes open and one with them closed), Emmet brings his construction worker uniform to the party with tattered and frayed looking faded print elements.</p>

<p>He&#39;s a weaker offering admittedly from this new Series for The LEGO Movie 2 CMF. Still, a nice addition to any collection and represents a moment from the film which is very well-received. Somewhat Recommended.</p>
