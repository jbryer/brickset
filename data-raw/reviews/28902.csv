<p>Lucy includes a new head piece with goggles. She comes with a pair of light grey binoculars, a black quiver and a dual-sided face with a smiling happy expression and a frowning prepared for anything expression. Curiously despite having a quiver she does not include any type of bow, I don&#39;t believe she used one in the movie, but it might have been nice to include it here, perhaps in a new colour to represent Lucy&#39;s unique style choice of hot blue and pink. She also does not include any alternate hair piece.</p>

<p>Compared with Emmet&nbsp;I would say Lucy here is a more interesting looking figure. Definitely higher up on my Recommended list. Her printing is top-notch, her accessories work well, and she&#39;s definitely a nice variant to own. I just wish she also had a bow of some kind to go with that quiver. Just to complete the look. Recommended.</p>
