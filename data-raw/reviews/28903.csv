He was a Master Builder originally, and he is back to chew bubble gum and take names, and he&#39;s all out of bubble gum.</p>

<p>Re-using the same parts previously, the printing has changed to reflect the new look, and he has been given a new pair of legs with dual-moulding for the wearing of pants look. His print includes some suspenders for the shorts he&#39;s got on, a new tattoo on his torso, the same scaly looking detailing on his torso and face, and some nice dystopian looking outfit details such as chains and metal patches. He includes a brown whip accessory and is overall quite impressive.</p>

<p>Love the idea of taking a classic horror monster and putting it into a dystopian future. I would recommend this one quite highly for the pure charm of it alone. Highly Recommended.</p>
