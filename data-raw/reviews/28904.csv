This minifigure includes a new crayon costume part with a nicely detailed print. I like both expressions on her. However, I still do appreciate the more and more creative minifigure costumes lego has been coming out with so I am happy to add this one to my collection!</p>

<p>The costume has printing of little flower emblems and her legs are dual-moulded giving us some nice rich dark purple boots/socks, she also has two expressions, open-eye smiling and closed-eye smiling. Actually the lack of printing for this character makes her parts perfect for Monofig collectors. She has dark purple hands unfortunately and I&#39;m not sure a light purple hand has been made before. I foresee an entire box of crayons at some point to re-use this piece, we still need green, blue, red, orange, yellow, black, white, grey, metallic grey, pearl gold, light green, tangerine twist... er... and whatever other colours I&#39;ve forgotten from my big box of crayons.</p>

<p>Highly Recommended.</p>
