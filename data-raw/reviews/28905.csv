This particular battle pack sort of came out of nowhere, much like the Elemental Masters one from 2017.&nbsp; The pack gives us fans and collectors a chance to get our hands on the Oni in minifigure form, since there weren&#39;t any March of the Oni sets due to the Legacy wave taking the spot for January 2019.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>The figures were already put together in the packaging and the weapons took like 10 seconds to build so...yeah.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>The first Oni in the pack is the biggest and most over-the-top one, Omega.&nbsp; He is the main leader of the Oni in Season 10 and he has an exclusive printed Oni Mask piece in black to represent his face.&nbsp; The horn pieces used are ridiculously large, but look cool all the same.&nbsp; Aside from the Oni Mask piece, the rest of his parts are the same ones used for the other Oni.</p>

<p>Each Oni has an identical torso printing on a black torso with wrinkle lines and a large white necklace(?).&nbsp; The face prints for each are really evil looking and accurate to the show appearance, and the other two Oni besides Omega use the Black Panther ear pieces turned around to the front to resemble their horns, I guess.&nbsp; Omega and the short Oni have the ZX shoulderpads in black for their armor, while the other Oni wears the Sons of Garmadon armor piece backwards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The weapons for each figure are nothing that special, except for the normal height Oni, who has this really interesting staff with a blade attached to the side of it.&nbsp; Omega has a weird walking stick and the short Oni has an axe.&nbsp; Each weapon has a black tassle and translucent purple stud in some place.&nbsp; Omega and the short Oni both have two black katanas.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>This is a really nice battle pack for $12.&nbsp; The figures are nice, even if they reuse a lot of the same parts.&nbsp; Omega&#39;s Oni Mask piece is by far the best piece in this set.&nbsp; If you&#39;re a Ninjago fan or simply like the Oni figures, I&#39;d recommend getting this soon since I don&#39;t know how much longer LEGO will keep this in stock.</p>
