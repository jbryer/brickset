<p><strong>Accessory</strong></p>

<p>This adorable giraffe has a small leaf element in the light green ,that was used in the previous cmf series for Neville Longbottom, He doesn&#39;t just get one of these though he gets two one for hte figure and one as a spare piece which have now been reintroduced to the Minifigure line for the first time since 2011.</p>

<p>Giraffe Guy has a new exclusive costume hat piece for the giraffes head that is moulded in the nice Cool Yellow colour that most of the figure is moulded in. This hat piece has large orange scales all over even under the hole for the head, there also are two eyes printed plus some brown print on top, behind the piece is a brown line that is moulded and printed. His face is dual sided with on side having a smirk with his eyebrows raised and on the other side he is chipper and smiling.</p>

<p>Now his torso is printed onto a cool yellow torso with the continuation of the orange scales on both arms the back and most of the front where there is a blank space for his belly. That orange scale design continues onto his cool yellow hips and the first half of his dual-moulded legs with the top being cool yellow and the bottom being brown with no print on the brown sadly.</p>

<p><strong>___________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>Now this figure is impressively adorable and reminds me and im sure others of the dead icon for Toys R Us Geoffrey Giraffe. I love his newly created hat piece that perfectly represents a giraffes head and the detail all over the piece and figure is remarkable and perfect. This character will be highly popular behind the Wizard of Oz characters.</p>

<p>I recommend this figure to anyone trying to complete the series or who like the animal suit people or Giraffes or people who want to try make a minifigure for their Toys R Us MOC</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Pros-</b> Well designed figure, the extra leaf piece is nice to have, Perfectly executed head mould, Just a great figure all round</p>

<p><b>Cons-</b> I still think the minifigures series should retail for &pound;2.49 and not their current &pound;3 but that just a con with the whole theme and not this figure directly.&nbsp;</p>

"J14T14","2019-04-02T04:45:17.303Z","""I was dead, but now I have come back to life!""","<p>Now that I have gotten that out of place quote from <em>Night at the Museum 2</em> out of the way, let&#39;s talk about the elephant in the room. Wait! Sorry. Wrong series. Anyway, this is still an amazing&nbsp;figure to have. It is the first non-duplo, and not brick-built LEGO giraffe we have gotten that doesn&#39;t look like it it is going to kill you in your sleep (I am looking at you&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40077-1/Geoffrey"">40077-1 Geoffrey</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40228-1/Geoffrey-Friends"">40228-1</a>&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40228-1/Geoffrey-Friends"">Geoffrey &amp; Friends</a>). It is also really nice to have since we were unable to get the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40316-1/Geoffrey"">40316-1 Geoffrey</a>&nbsp;brickheadz&nbsp;due to the closing of&nbsp;Toys R Us in the USA (R.I.P old friend. I only shopped their once).</p>

<p>The figure itself has printed, duel molded legs and a nicely detailed torso. One&nbsp;thing that is missing that this figure could have benefited from is a new tail piece similar to the tail found on the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71013-4/Cute-Little-Devil"">71013-4</a>&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71013-4/Cute-Little-Devil"">Cute Little Devil</a>, but with a tuff of fur on the end instead of a point. Now the head piece is a new mold and it is detailed excellently. It looks both realistic and cute in the perfect LEGO style. The head has two new smiling face prints. One showing teeth and one&nbsp;not. Now one thing that I have noticed&nbsp;on this figure is that you can easily&nbsp;make it look more like an anthropomorphic&nbsp;giraffe, and less like a guy in the suit simply by replacing the head included with a plain, orange minifigure&nbsp;head. The open space at the bottom of the headpiece ends up looking like just another spot. Now for accessories, this figure comes with a 3-leaf plant piece, and it comes with an extra one.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a fantastic minifigure that will make anyone happy. It is fun for kids, and it is nostalgic&nbsp;for adults who grew up paying inflated prices for their LEGO&nbsp;sets and getting cool exclusives. (I mean seriously, why did people like that store so much?) Anyway, it is just nice that we got this figure a little late rather than not at all.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-11-30T19:23:05.2Z","Giraffe Powers Activate!","<p><b>Set #71023 Giraffe Guy:</b>&nbsp;Seen briefly in The LEGO Movie 2, this particular character adds another brand new animal costume to our menagerie of people who dress up as animals. Or inanimate objects. Or just plain anything they want to dress up as.</p>

<p>The spotted look of the animal is shown quite effectively on the print, but suffers a tad from a lack of side-printing on torsos, a trick LEGO has not created for any Minifigures as yet. So it does suffer a tad in the look, but overall looks very nicely done. Carrying a stalk of leaf to feed himself with, this guy has a teeth bearing smile on one side and a upraised smile on one corner on the other. He&#39;s probably got that song stuck inside his head. Dual-moulded legs round out the look quite nicely... It is a bit weird to see the animal&#39;s face with a minifigure face underneath though.</p>

<p>Overall a very lovely looking Minifigure and well worth the asking price. LEGO keeps making all of these super rare and unique animal head pieces and I wonder when or if we&#39;ll ever see them again? Strongly Recommended.</p>

"Master_Wu","2019-07-17T15:11:13.487Z","Great collectable!","<p>This long-necked giraffe minifig is another one of Lego&#39;s great ideas! It&#39;s got highly detailed arms, legs, torso and neck!</p>

<p>The whole minifigure is yellow with the traditional giraffe&nbsp;spots of orange covering it from head to toe. His legs are printed half brown to look like feet. His hands are brown like feet also! He has a double sided smiley face underneath the long neck which has excellent printing and molding making it look a lot like a giraffe!&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set was well worth my money and I recommend it&nbsp;for anyone who likes Legos!</p>

<p>Giraffe guy is a cool figure which you may not belive me when I say it is similar to the DC series flash .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The head mould is exclusive , his head is reused in the creator expert bookshop wich is not right , his torso is nicely printed , his legs are dual moulded and have side printing along with the arms .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>&nbsp;His accessory is just a stub in light green . The stand is the standard Lego movie two white CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a great figure it is just the fact of its head being reused which&nbsp;Lego needs to stop .&nbsp;</p>
