<p>The watermelon piece on his head is a nice looking slab of watermelon with details for seeds, rinds, and a hole for the minifigure to see out of! This guy has a two-sided face: one shows a plain smile, and the other shows a cool smile with dark sunglasses. He wears a plain green T-shirt underneath and some pants that are half pink, and half white with green corners. He also holds a slice of watermelon and comes with an extra in case you loose it!</p>

<p>I really like this minifigure and recommend it for any lego fan who collects minifigures.</p>

<p>I actually discussed this new element in my recent review of Series 19&#39;s Pizza Costume Guy. This large costume element covers the unprinted torso partially, it is printed on both sides with seeds from the Watermelon. His legs are dual-moulded with white and pink colours while some minor green printing has been included. He carries two printed half-round tiles as Watermelon Slices. His expressions are smiling lopsidedly like Han Solo or smiling lopsidedly like Cool Guy Han Solo. (Because he&#39;s wearing shades.)</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;m a huge fan of quirky designs done right and I really dig Watermelon Dude as a solid offering. He stands out a bit more, but still there is not a whole lot of Characterisation for some of these characters. Still, I&#39;d recommend this Minifigure to everybody. Recommended.</p>
