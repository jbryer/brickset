<p>I hazard a guess that Sherry Scratchen-Post is in her 60s at least, as evidenced by the slight wrinkles on her torso print skin and the long grey hair piece she is using. She carries no accessories, but comes with Scarfield, a unique sculpted cat element with spiked mohawk and printed band-aids as well as visible fangs in his little mouth.</p>

<p>Her outfit would do Xena proud, a complete set of leather armour printed on her torso and legs with side-arm bands printed around her wrist and upper shoulder loaded with spikes. Her single sided face includes a grim expression, but adds some cuteness to it with whiskers and a pair of round red glasses.</p>

<p>Overall this character looks great and her parts are perfect for re-use of any type of warrior you&#39;d care to make, swap out the head and hair for something different and you could make that Xena Minifig I mentioned, or any number of other powerful warrior women. Highly Recommended.</p>
