<p>Benny is the best character in whole Lego Movie and one of the best in this pile of CMFs. Minifig is designed very simple, with no prints on legs, hips, and arms but apart from that looks just amazing. Destroyed logo on his chest looks like it have really been scratched off. Broken helmet, icon of Benny character is also made so good. Whole this plain blue fig is just charming. Whole look is completed by blue air-tanks.</p>

<p>Very important part of fig is of course, what differs it from another - robotic arm. It is quite an old part, but still looks perfect. It&#39;s little bit tough to put in his hand, which makes one arm longer than the other one, but it isn&#39;t so bad.</p>

<p>Benny has two prints on his head, both made very carefully. One is angry, with a little bit closed eye, and second one - very happy - with a big smile and uncovered tongue. I prefer&nbsp;this first one, though the happy one is probably more useful in TLM2&nbsp;MOCs, and fits better to Bennie&#39;s nature.</p>

<p>Last thing in this set is Bennie&#39;s tool box. It is simply molded part, but looks very pleasant. Bets and most important thing is of course classic space logo on the side. It is really small, but makes a great job. Whole box contrast very well with spaceman body.</p>

<p>Also to this fig we get white stand, which seems to be very useful in MOCs, but i prefer old, black one, and additional robo-hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apocalypsbug Benny is a very solid fig, which looks great on a display and as a part of a model. It&#39;s little bit overpriced (like every other minifig) but still is worth buying as one of a really few in this series.&nbsp;</p>

"charleslegoguy","2020-02-06T11:00:52.803Z","Detailed minifigure with nice prints and cool parts","<p>This is one of the LEGO Movie 2 minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For the parts, I think this minifigure has many useful parts like the cracked helmet which is a very cool piece, and the torso print is also interesting and useful. I think the most useful piece in this whole minifigure&nbsp;for MOC&#39;s&nbsp;is the toolbox. It has a nice space logo on it and can also be used by any minifigure. Overall, i think this is a very cool and well-designed minifigure and I predict a lot of people might want it as well.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-11-30T17:58:58.83Z","Missing Arm, but still SPACESHIPS!","<p><b>Set #71023 Apocalypse Benny:</b>&nbsp;Our favourite Spaceship loving Minifig is using all the same parts from previous iterations save for the torso, here you will find they&#39;ve replaced one regular LEGO arm with one cyborg style arm indicating that somehow Benny lost an arm.</p>

<p>His printing is a faded Classic Space logo on his torso, while a more defined Classic Space Logo can be found printed on his toolbox accessory. His facial expression is brooding or big happy smile, even with one arm missing he&#39;s still in love with Spaceships and will gladly shout it to the heavens.</p>

<p>If you want some Classic LEGO Spacemen with cyborg arms to add to your displays you&#39;ll probably want to buy multiples and swap the heads out for more traditional looking spacemen. Overall a very nice Benny Variant and much appreciated. Highly Recommended.</p>
