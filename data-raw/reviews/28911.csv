Raptor trainer!","<p>This figure, in my opinion , is one of the better figures&nbsp;from The Lego Movie 2 minifigure series. It&#39;s most definitely not the best figure out there of the minifigures&nbsp;line , it&#39;s just&nbsp;a really good variant of the character , Rex.</p>

<p>Starting off , I just want to bring the spotlight to the legs , because those legs are awesome! Especially love&nbsp;the fringes detailing on the side of the legs.&nbsp;You could most certainly use these legs on custom cowboys , because this figure is essentially a cowboy variant of Rex. Other than those amazing exclusive legs , the torso is the same one from the other Lego Movie 2 sets that include Rex , which I&#39;m fine with mostly because the legs make up for it and the torso was already perfect as is. The exclusive face prints with this figure are the determined face and the talking/cocky (that&#39;s just what the face print looks like to me) which I really like both expressions and don&#39;t really have a preference for either one, they&#39;re just pretty much equally good to me. The best part of the figure is easily the new hair/hat combo , I really appreciate the attention to detail with this &nbsp;incredible new piece with the really awesome ridges on the hair portion of the piece, and like the &#39; Awesome Remix Emmet&#39; figure&#39;s &nbsp;hair/headphones combo, it&#39;s a new mold that could be recolored for different characters. His accessory , the baby raptor , while not exclusive , is a really nice inclusion as it&#39;s a cool raptor and a really cheap alternative way to get this design of the baby raptor as opposed to the Movie Maker set and the Rexcelsior.</p>

<p>There&#39;s definitely a lot to like about this figure , I personally prefer it SLIGHTLY more than the Awesome Remix Emmet from the same series , but not by much. The idea of a cowboy variant of Rex doesn&#39;t sound too&nbsp;interesting at first , but the execution of the figure was done very well to distinguish this figure as a variant and it&#39;s own thing. This figure is nothing TOO special , but it&#39;s a better overall figure than most of the other figures from the same series and it deserves and gets my recommendation for a purchase , especially if you&#39;re a fan of the Lego movies like me.</p>

He also includes a little baby blue raptor, this is the absolute cheapest method to acquire this mold in this colour scheme and should be farmed if you&#39;re looking for a pack of these things.</p>

<p>The loveable Rex includes two expressions on his face, one determined looking grin the other with his mouth open and eyes closed as if in the middle of saying something. Overall this is an excellent looking Minifigure and a fun Rex variant. If you want the Blue Raptor child getting him is a must. Highly Recommended.</p>
