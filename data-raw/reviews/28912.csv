"Master_Wu","2019-07-17T15:34:01.193Z","We're off to see the wizard!","<p>Dorothy is a very iconic minifigure from the classic film: The Wizard of Oz. She has some nice detailing and even comes with her dog,&nbsp;Toto!</p>

<p>Dorothy&#39;s hair is made of a rubber-like material so the braids can move around a little bit. She has a two-sided face showing a concerned face, or a happy smile. Her torso has short sleeve printing and great detailing of a blu and white checkered garment on the front and back of her torso. She wears a checkered skirt which goes on top of her legs which are printed half white, and half blue with some flesh color in&nbsp;between. Her feet also have some nice sparkley ruby slipper printing all around the legs except for the back.</p>

<p>The only problem I have with this set is that the dog cannot clip&nbsp;to the stand at the same time as Dorothy.</p>

<p>I recommend this set more for adults who collect minifigures!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-02T17:45:18.953Z","Off to See the Wizard.","<p><b>Set #71023 Dorothy Gale &amp; Toto:</b>&nbsp;When we first learned of LEGO Dimensions and The Wizard of Oz being a part of it, many of us hoped to receive the main cast in Minifigure form. Sadly only the Wicked Witch of the West appeared. Then came The LEGO Batman Movie where the Winged Monkeys and Wicked Witch had another guest appearance.</p>

<p>Enter The LEGO Movie 2, the Second Part, where we find at last all four main characters from the classic film adaptation of The Wizard of Oz.</p>

<p>Toto looks excellent, his new sculpt is brilliantly crafted and printed with fine fur detailing to show off the lovable dog. My only complaint is he doesn&#39;t seem dark enough, this particular breed of dog is usually very black furred and the colouring of Toto here looks more on the Grey side of the colour spectrum. It just doesn&#39;t quite match what we saw on film.</p>

<p>Dorothy looks almost perfect. Her checkered skirt piece and blouse look brilliant, and we have ourselves an excellent new hair piece. She also has some great expressions with happy smiling on one side and concerned fear on the other. If it weren&#39;t for her very poorly done Ruby Slippers she&#39;d almost be perfect. The print on her feet used to simulate the Slippers is a tad weak. I would have preferred it if she&#39;d included new shoe elements for the feet similar to skates or flippers that could work better and be sculpted in that nice rich red colour.</p>

<p>As it stands, her slippers look unfinished, since they don&#39;t print details on the inner foot of a minifigure so they aren&#39;t all the way around. Still, I can look past that for finally being allowed to get her and her companions. Strongly Recommended.</p>
