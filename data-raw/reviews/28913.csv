Lets look at the accessory first.</span></p>

<p><b>Accessories</b></p>

<p>Cowardly Lion has only one accessory but its one of my favorites in the series it is the Lions medal that is printed onto a clear 1x2 tile</p>

<p><span style=""display: inline !important; float: none; background-color: transparent; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: noto sans,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-shadow: none; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">All 20 figures in this series including President Business has a new white minifigure base plate that thankfully has no print.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><b>Minifigure</b></p>

<p>Now Cowadly Lion is a great figure who is a nougat colour throughout, His new hair piece has two light nougat ears on the top, there are lines and curls moulded into the piece to represent his thick fur. He has a double sided face print on a light nougat head piece one side shows him frowning with his whiskers and eyes and a cute brown nose plus two bowing eyebrows, the other side has the same but his mouth is very happy as if he is about to cry that is how happy he looks.</p>

<p>Cowardly&#39;s torso has a zig zag lines to show fur on his belly and chest, this on the back asw ell, sadly no arm print. Between his legs and torso the is a exclusive colour for the minifigure animal piece, previously seen in series 18&#39;s Cat and Simpsons series 1&#39;s Sratchy to name a few, in a nice nougat colour. Finally his nougat legs have a two zig zag fur prints on his upper legs and his toe has some claws printed in brown.</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I love this figure so much, his great aesthetics are welcome. I adore his face prints and i like his new detailed hair piece so much. He is a great figure to buy without a doubt.</p>

<p>I would defiantly recommend this to any body especially those who love Wizard Of Oz as he is very well replicated in this tiny minifigure. I would say if your to buy any of these minifigures form this series this is one i would say you to get but then again most people who are buying this series are buying the 4 Wizard Of Oz characters</p>

<p><b>Pros -</b> Detailed excellently, nice printed medal, love the nougat tail, well produced hair piece.</p>

<p><b>Cons -&nbsp;</b> None To Mention</p>

<p>The cowardly lion has some nice features. His legs have toe claw printingat the botoms and some ruffled fur&nbsp;printing at the top. He has a tail in between his legs and torso. His torso has some very plain printing of more ruffled fur on the front and the back. His head has two faces: a sad looking face, and a big happy smile face. The lion also comes with a cool looking medal that is printed on a clear tile. The head piece has some big ears popping out which look very nice but the piece cannot move which prevents the ability to pose his head.</p>

<p>I think this is a neat figure but is a little bland. While this minifigure is very cool and great for collectors,&nbsp;I&nbsp;would recommend other figures first.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-02T19:37:42.91Z","He's got Courage! Now he has Da Nerve.","<p><b>Set #71023 Cowardly Lion:</b>&nbsp;This brilliant beast of the forest is excellent designed based on the original 1930s film classic. Covered with fur printing on his light nougat torso and legs the Cowardly Lion includes a brand new head piece with lion&#39;s mane and ears. He features two wonderful expressions, a slight frowning scared expression and his grinning happy expression.</p>

<p>Printed on a 1x2 tile is the courage medal he receives from the Wizard. An actual medal was probably too much to expect here since it would not fit around his neck with the mane dangling over his chest and it couldn&#39;t actually pin to his chest as intended.</p>

<p>Also included is his tail element and that rounds out the look of this very welcome addition to the collection. I&#39;d strongly recommend picking him up if you missed out on him. Strongly Recommended.</p>
