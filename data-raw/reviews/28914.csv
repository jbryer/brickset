"Minifig290","2019-01-20T22:37:42.343Z","A Shiney Figure With A Story","<p>Hello All, today I was able to get the LEGO Movie Two Minifigures and one of those characters i got included Tin Man, each minifigure packets retail for &pound;2.99 or $3.99 and released February 1st officially, Tin Man has 8 parts including base plate giving him a Price Per Part of 37p/49c. Now my Tin Man figure has a story which i will tell in this review that is a bit interesting. Lets look at the accessories first.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>Tin Man has two accessories his silver axe and heart, His axe is a new exclusive pearl silver piece and his heart uses the new 1x1 heart tile in red with a exclusive print of a clock, and because this series has now got extra parts you get two of these heart pieces.</p>

<p>All 20 figures in this series including Tin Man has a new white minifigure base plate that thankfully has no print.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Tin Man himself is fully pearl silver head to toe, his hat is a new mold with a friends hair accessory sized hole on top. His head has his metal face printed with a few bolts screws and metal plates printed on alongside his mouth, nose and eyes. Between his neck there is a exclusive pearl silver bow piece that was introduced in the Batcave back in 2017. Now his torso has some bolts printed on the front with some dark silver print to show some rust or oil on the front and back, he also has some nice arm print with metal plates and bolts. Finally Tin Mans legs have the same oil print. He also has some side leg print with some bolts and screws.4</p>

<p><strong>Bonus + Story Time</strong></p>

<p>Now when i brought this figure from my local Argos i thought it would be the usual minifigure opening experience apart form the new packaging but i was wrong when I opened my Tin Man he only had 1 heart accessory and it was damaged with nicks all over the part on the front and back which i assume must have been a production error and passed the quality control, so i was a bit disappointed so I wanted a replacement from LEGO Customer Service but when I was to order he part from LEGO&#39;s replacement service i found that the set number was not yet entered into the system so i had to chat with a Rep for the Customer Service and i told him the situation and he told me that there was no possable way to replace the part and he could not send a replacement figure packet so offered me two Harry Potter CMF&#39;s but then he messaged me a few minutes later saying they where out of stock so he gave me 300 VIP points that is equal to &pound;15.</p>

<p><strong>___________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>So that was an interesting experience, but back to the figure. I love the inclusion of the four Wizard Of Oz characters especially Tin Man, i love his accessories and the pearl silver bow is awesome to get one plus two extras of.</p>

<p>I would recommend this figure if your just planning to get a few but i&#39;m sure that most people who get any character sof this series is planning to at least get the four Wizard Of Oz characters. I&#39;m sure that both kids and adults will love this figure.</p>

<p><strong>Pros - </strong>Great accessories, white base plates, 3 extra parts (2 bows and heart piece, even if mine only had one brocken one), pearl silver figure, well detailed.</p>

<p><b>Cons - </b>None to mention</p>

<p>First of all, this tiny android has this classic, I may say, late &#39;80s vibe&nbsp;in it. It looks a little bit rusty, a little bit damaged&nbsp;with some stains all over the body. It is a very simple minifig, but still looks excellent. His printing is really subtle,, just some stains, buttons, patches and, to be honest, nothing more. His body looks like he wears some kind of metal shirt. He has a great leg printing though. On a side of a leg You can see very nice details of some metal parts, which may be his boots.</p>

<p>His face is also surprisingly simple. Even though he has additional color applied on the jaw (is little bit shiny) this is just a simple happy face. Face is little bit more decorated than in standard&nbsp;fig (has nose and eyebrows), but still&nbsp;it is so minimalistic. But, apart from its simpleness, it looks great. Again it reminds&nbsp;me some kind of android from Sci-Fi&nbsp;movie.</p>

<p>As additions to his appearance he&#39;s got little bowtie - done in plain silver, looks nice, and, as a head gear ordinary kitchen-like&nbsp;funnel which looks just great. Only bad thing &#39;bout this part is that the top is smaller than minifig&nbsp;hand so you can&#39;t use it &quot;official&quot; way.</p>

<p>In his hands he hold plain silver axe, which is nothing special, but still is a very useful part, and clockwork heart. And this part has a special place in my heart. It is this new, 2019 heart-shaped tile, with an old fashioned clock printed on. This part is wonderful. It may have so many way to be use in MOCs&nbsp;and overall is great addition to fig, especially with the fact that it fits to his story.</p>

<p>Also to this fig we get white stand, which seems to be very useful in MOCs, but i prefer old, black one, and additional two bowties&nbsp;and one heart.</p>

<p>Though whole series of minifig&nbsp;looks really bad and poorly, this guy really stands out. It is a solid fig, with great accessories and thousand of usage in MOCs. And also he looks perfectly on a display.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-02T20:31:56.6Z","The Heart!","<p><b>Set #71023 Tin Man:</b>&nbsp;Our final Wizard of Oz Minifigure slipped into The LEGO Movie 2 CMF Series is the Tin Man. He includes a very nice selection of parts in a rich silver tone and that includes three bow tie elements.</p>

<p>Rivets run the length of torso as buttons and on his legs as well to add further detail for this marvelous creation from Oz. He carries the new axe element for Fire Fighters all in silver, no printed detailing or alternate colours, and he includes a printed heart tile for the clock that the Wizard presented him at the finale of the film. He also includes a nice looking new head piece for his top, the only thing missing is his trusty oil can, such a shame, he may rust without one.</p>

<p>With his cute printed nose and smiling innocent facial expression this is a must-own Minifigure from this Series. Highly impressive and I would Highly Recommend tracking one down. The parts alone are worth the asking price. Highly Recommended.</p>

"Master_Wu","2019-07-17T17:53:03.6Z","Shiny! ","<p>The tin man from The Wizard of Oz is a nice, shiny collectable. He holds a tin ax and a heart that&#39;s supposed to look robotic. The heart has a fancy clock on it. The tin man has a funny hat and a bow&nbsp;tie. His face has metal screws and bo lts plus a faint smile and a button nose. His torso has detailed printing on the arms and on the front and back it shows rust marks. The legs have details on the fronts and sides showing lines, screws and more rust. I really like this minifigure and I&#39;m glad I bought it.</p>

<p>I recommend this minifigure more towards adult collectors who like the film.</p>
