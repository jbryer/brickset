<p><strong>Accessory</strong></p>

<p>Scarecrow has one accessory a exclusive 2x2 white printed tile with the text &quot;Certificate of ACHEIVEMENT&quot;, also some black lines that represent some smaller text plus there is a signature and red ink stamp wih a tan border around the part.</p>

<p style=""background-attachment: scroll; background-clip: border-box; background-color: transparent; background-image: none; background-origin: padding-box; background-position-x: 0%; background-position-y: 0%; background-repeat: repeat; background-size: auto; color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: noto sans,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif; font-size: 14px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; margin-bottom: 14px; margin-left: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-top: 14px; orphans: 2; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-shadow: none; text-transform: none; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"">All 20 figures in this series including Scarecrow has a new white minifigure base plate that thankfully has no print.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Scarecrow himself uses what i believe is a new cylindrical point on top with a nougat bow printed around the bottom middle of the part, his head is printed on a tan head piece showing some wrinkles and a brown - orange noes and his eyes and mouth. Now his dark green torso that has a string of rope around the bottom of his neck and stomach plus a few tears with straw coming through on the front and back. Finally his dark brown legs have printing showing some stitched on knee patches and a continuation of the rope on his legs and hips.</p>

<p><b>Overal</b><b>l</b></p>

<p>Now as i stated in my previous review of a Wizard Of Oz figure in this series i love the inclusion of the four Wizard Of Oz character, but Scarecrow is my least favorite of the four but that does not mean his a bad figure what so ever. I love the print on his 2x2 tile and his new hat is a awesome piece.</p>

<p>I would recommend this figure to anyone planning to just buy a few of this series but then again if your going to buy any of the figures in this series your probably going to buy all four of the Wizard Of Oz characters.</p>

<p><b>Pros -</b> Great printing throughout, Awesome new hat piece, nice well detailed accessory.</p>

<p><b>Cons - </b>None to mention</p>

His head has a happy face with nice lines to make it look like straw. His torso shows a green shirt with some straw sticking out of it and a rope to tie it down. The rope continues down his legs. He also has some patches at his knees. He holds a tile that say certificate of achievement some scribbled words and a ribbon at the bottom.</p>

<p>I would recommend this set to anyone who likes collecting minifigures.</p>

Why, he does, he Does Have a Brain.","<p><b>Set #71023 Scarecrow:</b>&nbsp;Compared to the Scarecrow in an earlier series, this fellow made to resemble the character from the 1930s classic film The Wizard of Oz features some very impressive detail and a nice new hat.</p>

<p>The cords, straw and everything else is there, patches on the legs, bits of cloth, it is all here. He has a nice new hat element which includes some sculpted detailing for the band around it and his face has the signature nose, a rare item to be printing on Minifigure heads. A printed tile with the Certificate of Achievement he received from the Wizard is included for accessories.</p>

<p>Overall a very solid offering and a must-have for fans of the franchise. Highly Recommended.</p>
