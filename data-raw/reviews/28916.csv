<p><b>Minifigure</b></p>

<p>President Business has a casual older outfit with a sand green torso that has a diamond white and dark green pattern with a white button up shirt underneath. He has dual molded white arms. His dual molded dark green and tan legs have a checkered print on the tan part plus a belt on the hip ad the dark green section has some black shoe print.</p>

<p>In 2014 The LEGO Movie introduced Presidents Business&#39;s blocky dark orange and tan hair that has thankfully been re-released in this figure. Mr Business has a double sided head that has one expression showing happiness with wide eyes and a cheery mouth, while on the other side he has a more concentrated face print with focused eyes and mouth expression.</p>

<p><strong>___________________________________________________________________________</strong></p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>Now this is my favorite of the 16 LEGO Movie figure in the series, so not including the 4 Wizard Of Oz characters. I love his great printing on his outfit and the new golf club is excellent plus the re-release of his popular quirky hair is very welcome by many.</p>

<p>Now Gone Golfin President Business is a great figure to get if you are considering to buy on or two packs as he has new parts and prints and makes the &pound;3/$4 price seem slightly reasonable.</p>

<p><b>Pros -</b> Great printing, nice new golf club, welcome re-release of his blocky hair.</p>

<p><strong>Cons - </strong>None To Mention&nbsp;</p>

But it might have been nice if we got a little more Will Ferrel in this film.</p>

<p>Dressed to the nines in classic golfing attire, President Business is only missing the funny little hat some golfers wear. He&#39;s got a very nice sweater design with diamon patterns, an impressive design for Golfing pants with dual-moulding to enhance the deliciously &#39;Dad&#39; like print. He has equally fun expressions, with one side being open-mouthed smiling and the other looking like he&#39;s laughing awkwardly at some bad joke. And of course he has the putter, an excellent new accessory from LEGO sporting goods providers. Octan. It&#39;s always Octan. Er, not that this club has any Octan logos on it or anything like that.</p>

<p>Overall a decent enough Minifigure, very solid middle of the road look and feel. Recommended.</p>
