Considering they cancelled the Flashback scene as it was intended to appear, and we didn&#39;t see much of this version of Lucy on screen.</p>

<p>The answer may surprise you. My first Flashback Lucy actually had a cracked torso straight out of the package, fortunately I had a spare and then after reporting it LEGO sent me a random bag and it turned out to be Flashback Lucy.</p>

<p>Flashback Lucy includes a very Lucy looking costume, it&#39;s loaded with awesome and includes a nice print featuring bubble details. The dark blue and magenta compliment her lighter blue and magenta hairstyle, which she hid behind black marker for a very long time. Included with her is some rather revealing accessories, a pink microphone and a printed tile featuring the Gold Single Everything is Awesome. Gasp. Does this mean Lucy wrote and sang Everything is Awesome? Oh wow, no wonder Emmet fell for her at first sight.</p>

<p>Her facial expressions include the smiling standard look for Lucy and an open mouth closed eyes singing expression as she belts out the lyrics to her song. With dual-moulded legs and an excellent overall design I&#39;m pleased to own three of her, cracks and all, and would highly recommend her.</p>

<p>Highly Recommended.</p>
