Or Super Pop-Star?","<p><b>Set #71023 Candy Rapper:</b>&nbsp;This punny miss is dressed in a tutu with white and pink stripes and features a top to match, her legs are dual-moulded with white and pink as well and overall she&#39;s a very impressive looking Minifigure with some interesting ideas behind her.</p>

<p>Idea 1: She&#39;s a Music Star, as evidenced by her included accessories of a microphone and audio cassette.</p>

<p>Idea 2: She&#39;s dressed like a Candy Wrapper, hence her very punnish name since she might be a Rap Star.</p>

<p>Idea 3: Well there is really no idea 3, but Her hair is a very nice shade of pink, there&#39;s some excellent silver star detailing on her hair, tutu and back, and she has two awesome expressions. Smiling and Smiling with a Wink.</p>

<p>I would strongly recommend getting her, she&#39;s just a great, fun looking Minifigure. I know absolutely nothing about her as a character, but I love her look and wish I could have at least gotten doubles for my collection. Overall Strongly Recommended.</p>
