She sings, she plays guitar, and she chases mice, all in one package. Granted it might just be a costume, but she does include the hair/ear combination head piece first used on 1960s era Catwoman and the cat tail accessory for around her waist.</p>

<p>She includes some nice dual-moulded legs with a very bright teal colour used, her costume is printed with leopard style spots as well and her guitar has tiger stripes in fuchsia (a type of hot pink), she&#39;s got a singing expression on one side and a regular smiling expression on the other both complete with printed whiskers.</p>

<p>Overall this is another great addition from the Systar System. Everything about her is very colourful and very fun. She reminds me of Josie and the Pussycats with her costume design. Recommended.</p>
