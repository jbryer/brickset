Especially because I was having him hold two sticks for a dual weld look. Yes, he comes with an extra stick for the axe, it makes one wish he come with an extra axe head, for a proper dual weld look with all his parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think Abe will be a popular figure because of the diversity of his design. The most common thing people are going to have him do is fight vampires, because of the cult movie &quot;Abraham Lincoln Vampire Slayer&quot;. But like I said he could be used in multiple setting like a &quot;Steampunk&quot; or &quot;Victoria Era&quot;. Plus, like I said earlier part of a gang.</p>

<p>His head part does have two different expressions. And his back has a print of a top hat with two axes. Not to mention the arms have bracelets printed on them.&nbsp;</p>

Immediately, I wanted the&nbsp;Apocalypseburg Abe figure. Abraham Lincoln is my favorite US president and I really wanted a version of him since I am currently unable to get the original one. The first pack I bought had this figure in it, ad I didn&#39;t even feel the bag!</p>

<p>The figure has a new hair, hat combo that is different than the original Abe Lincoln minifigure. The hat is now dark brown and it has a pair of goggles&nbsp;molded on. This piece sill be especially useful for steam punk mocs and anyone who wants to make a Disney &quot;Journey&nbsp;into Imagination&quot; Moc if you want to make a figure of the Dreamfinder&nbsp;(someone please do, I really want to see that. It would be so cool!) The figure also has all new prints on the head, torso, legs, and arms. He also comes with an ax, which is&nbsp;nothing too special.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great figure and poses a lot of value for moc makers, collectors, and kids alike and will make a fine addition to anyone&#39;s collection.</p>

We wrecked brick up!","<p><b>Set #71023 Apocalypseburg Abe:</b>&nbsp;Welcome to the wonderful world of Steampunk Dystopia, where Abraham Lincoln is alive and well and wielding an Axe. Maybe to kill vampires, possibly to deal with pesky assassins, who can say?</p>

<p>Given a brand-new hat/beard combination head piece with sculpted goggles along the brim and featuring two distinct expressions, a smiling one and a grimacing ready for battle one, we have a very nice print as well with some awesome details. The silver LEGO Skull belt buckle is pretty nice. The matching knee belt is pretty awesome too. He even has his own logo on his back with a stovetop hat and twin axes crossed almost like a coat-of-arms.</p>

<p>Overall Abe here is a great addition to the ranks of citizens living in Apocalypseburg and definitely worth tracking down if you missed out. Strongly Recommended.</p>
