Either this represents a flashback moment or it&#39;s after she&#39;s calmed down from being Warrior Kitty.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a nice addition, but somewhat redundant if you collected all the sets from the first movie. Still, she&#39;s a very nice solid build and fun to have if you&#39;re new to the franchise and don&#39;t already own her. Recommended.</p>

<p>Unikitty is a very beloved and popular character from the two Lego Movie films, however &#39;Lego Movie 2 The Second Part&#39; introduced the apocalypse unikitty, which was an interesting and rustic design, but in the own CMF series for the sequel it included a Unikitty that appears to have been taken out of a 2014 &#39;Lego Movie&#39; set.</p>

<p>The figure -</p>

<p>The figure has a light blue horn attached to a hollow white stud, two dark pink 1&times;1 cheese slopes for ears on a 1&times;3 pink plate, a generic printed unikitty face on a 1&times;3 pink brick with a 1&times;3 white plate underneath, a hollow spring green stud is the attached for a very unstable neck, an unprinted 1&times;3 pink arch brick for the body and a printed white tail and the feet are a sand yellow and light blue 1&times;1 plate attached to 1&times;1 white plates for her rainbow design.</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is just the standard white &#39;Lego Movie two The Second Part&#39; CMF stand.</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This is a good figure for someone who doesn&#39;t own a normal Unikitty however whilst it is subjectively a good figure, it is objectively a bad CMF, it just isn&#39;t interesting enough to warrant that kind of exposure. Also,&nbsp;the neck/head attachment is so weak it falls off with the slightest touch, I really don&#39;t understand this as Lego have a much sturdier design for this but oh well, with that in mind I can only recommend this to a select group, but most people have this seen&nbsp;as though it came out 2 years and 8 months ago (at the time of writing this review).</p>
