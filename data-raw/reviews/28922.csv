She includes a record and pink microphone for her accessories, features a brand-new hair element with some nice curls and colour choices and features a highly impressive upper torso print.</p>

<p>Her lower body is covered by a half-side cloth skirt while she has minimal printing on her feet and waist area to simulate traditional garb from this particular style of dress. She features two distinct smiling expressions, a wider smile and a more subdued normal type of smile with less visible teeth.</p>

<p>Overall Hula Lula isn&#39;t much to talk about, but she&#39;s a great figure. I&#39;d definitely recommend her, it&#39;s just such a shame that there weren&#39;t as many memorable moments from the sequel to feature a lot of these unnamed characters. Recommended.</p>
