"Faefrost","2019-02-04T04:40:26.69Z","A delightful little Polybag","<p>So many recent Polybags just feel meh, that is wonderful to finally get one that just feels right. It is a fun little set on its own. Provides a nice expansion to existing displays or play patterns. And gives some interesting parts and builds. This does all of that nicely.</p>

<p>The set builds a nice little popcorn cart, roughly 4x4 studs wide plus wheels and handles. Through some clever build techniques and an interesting use of windows and panels it has a neat popping popcorn play feature.</p>

<p>Minifig&nbsp;- The included minifig&nbsp;is a fairly standard city fig combination. The torso is nothing new, nor is his face and unprinted khaki legs. He has a standard modern red ball cap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>parts - For a tiny little polybag there are a few really neat parts. The star of the show is the 1x1 printed brick to represent a popcorn bag. It&#39;s marvelous. You also get three of the ice cream/smoke pieces to represent popcorn. 1 goes on the bag and 2 go in the cart to be bounced around to simulate popping. The set also has 2 of the newer &quot;wheelchair&quot; type wheels which are always nice to get.</p>

<p>Build - it&#39;s a simple build that will take you five minutes. But it is a perfect little street vendor to go with your city or Modular town, or to take residence in your growing fairground.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall - Fantastic Polybag. If you see it, grab it.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-19T22:45:27.88Z","Awesome Unique Offering from 2019.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #30364 Popcorn Cart:</b> As with most years LEGO will provide some nice food-based vendors in City Polybags. From Hot-Dog Stands to Popcorn Carts every LEGO City needs multiple food vendors outside of the many attractive tourist destinations. So this is the best offering from LEGO City Polybags in 2019.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Great model with a fun play feature.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Printed Popcorn Box 1x1 brick included.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Smiling vendor Minifigure included.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Vendor Minifigure has generic tourist look, does not feature a uniform print or the hat element used in the past.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Difficult to find at retail.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Get as many of this set as you can. I strongly recommend buying at least five or more to populate LEGO City. Or, failing that, get some parts from Pick-A-Brick and build your own with various other colours to make alternate flavored Popcorn vendors for your LEGO City and LEGO Creator Expert Fairground. This is the best Polybag from LEGO City this year and I recommend it strongly.</p>

"Lego_fan_","2020-01-10T02:38:22.36Z","Pop that corn","<p>Lego set #30364 is a great addition to any Lego city and is a must have as the Minifigures need a place to eat as well you know.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set includes one pop corn vender Minifigure&nbsp;and a pop corn cart.</p>

<p>The Minifigure is nothing special and is just normal parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cart however is a real cool build. It is like most normal pop corn machines that you see but it has poles for your vender to pull it along with. It also has a pop corn bag element and a realy cool function.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The function is that when you put the corn in the machine and press down on the plate sticking out the corn pops making it pop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall i think this set is great and is a&nbsp; fun little addtion to my and any other persons collection.&nbsp;</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2020-12-26T22:59:07.917Z","Goes great with my hotdog cart from 2018 ","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>The popcorn cart is a good polybag with a unique in paper design and a fun integrated play feature .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The figure has a newer style cap in red , a large grinning face print , a red flannel shirt and some dark tan legs .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build uses two wheelchair wheels at the bottom , half a hinge piece for a support , a modified 2&times;2 dark grey plate for transport , a platform with a very nice 1&times;1 printed popcorn box on a white brick , the case with the corn uses some bricks and technic and a plate so you can push up and down on it to make the three ice cream pieces inside shake like popcorn , the are four windows two of which can open and the top is tiled off .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a good polybag that in my opinion is only missing another popcorn box but the balance of play and display is great so I recommend it .</p>
