"Masterbuilder4071","2019-05-02T17:39:58.32Z","A really nice little set!","<p>I never really bought any of the older Toy Story sets, and I regret that. So when the new sets released, I had to buy some of them. So I just bought the smallest one as a sample if you will, and now I plan to get more Toy Story 4 sets.</p>

<h2>Contents/build</h2>

<p>The set comes with one medium bag and one small bag, with no numbers. Also in the box is the car starter brick and the instructions. No stickers because this is a juniors et of course. The build took me about 4 or 5 minutes and was fairly simplistic. It used a little bit of SNOT construction for the eyes, but the rest was just basic construction. You also do a bit of repetitive building for the side builds, with some brick-built blocks and some traffic cones. So overall a nice build.</p>

<h2>Minifigure</h2>

<p>Woody is the only figure in this set and is one of the main reasons I bought it. He is a detailed, good looking figure and has very nice printing. He does not have the same long arms and legs he used to have, as well as the molded head. But I have to say that this does not look bad. He looks more like a Minifigure, and I like that. He Has duel molded legs and a nex hair and hat combo, which looks good. His accessory is a brick-built remote for R.C.&nbsp;So a really nice inclusion for $10</p>

<h2>Build</h2>

<p>The finished product consists of a remote control, 6 blocks, 3 cones, and R.C. R.C is built around the Juniors starter brick and looks overall good. All the parts with detail on them have printing and look very nice and clean. Something this R.C has that the previous set did not is a seat for woody. Although there is not a seat in the movie, this does work nice and comfortably fits woody. R.C also has a receiver antenna with just a trans-red cylinder&nbsp;at the top. R.C rolls like any other&nbsp;Lego car would, just normal. Also included are three green Nanofigs, four if you count the extra. These are used to represent the green army men. It would have been nice to have at least some printed faces, but that&#39;s just a nitpick.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>Overall this is a really good set. you get a decent value, a great Minifigure, and a good build. This set makes me want to get other toy story sets, and I&#39;m sure I&nbsp;will. Thank you for reading, and I hope you enjoyed the review.&nbsp;</p>

And when I got it in hand it just didn&#39;t surprise me. Unlike the other toy story sets. I really can&#39;t expect much from a ten dollar set. Which is a good deal for what you get. You get woody, 3&nbsp;of the awesome green army men + a spare. And RC&nbsp; if you count that. So really looking at the price and the content, it is a great set. Just didn&#39;t surprise me.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-10-17T14:21:03.127Z","Junior Builds for Pixar Fans","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #10766 Woody &amp; RC:</b> Here is a small set for Toy Story 4, the smallest from the line and featuring something many probably are wondering, is this even in the movie? And I can&rsquo;t answer that without spoiling things. Anyway let&rsquo;s discuss this set real quick, because this is a 4+ set which is extremely small and so the things to discuss aren&rsquo;t as much as other sets have been sadly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a really cute looking box, I mean seriously the artwork on the front is awesome and fun and shows off the set very nicely. The back even shows off everything in a cute manner, somehow, I can&rsquo;t explain it, maybe it&rsquo;s just because this set is so tiny.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is folded inside because it is a smaller set, this is the only manual that was folded in any of the Toy Story 4 sets, which is a great idea, I&rsquo;m not a big fan on folding manuals in LEGO sets, it makes building things a hassle and a half at times.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Sadly this set doesn&rsquo;t feature a whole lot of parts. In fact if it were not for the 4+ specific large parts this set could have been a Polybag, we often see 69 pieces in Polybags that use multiple 1x1 tiles and the like. This set doesn&rsquo;t have those, but it does have a large black brick with axles to attach wheels to.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Green Army Man: Not officially counted as a Minifigure, the Microfigure is released in solid green here to represent Sarge and his men from Toy Story. It&rsquo;s a bit strange this doesn&rsquo;t count as a Minifigure since the trio is called out on the back of the box, also there&rsquo;s an extra inside so you can have four little green army men for Woody to interact with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Woody: This Minifigure is identical to the one we discussed in Duke Caboom&rsquo;s set. Sadly not a unique facial print either, no changes between this one and the one in the larger set. Ah well, it could be worse I suppose, but I digress. Really nice to get Woody in such a cheap set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build &amp; The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;m combining this discussion here because this model is a really simple build. RC is the main build with some building blocks made out of LEGO bricks and tiles and some cones built out of plates and cones, similar to how they would be built in any of the LEGO Cars sets. Overall the build is quick and easy, some might think a little too easy, but that is the point of 4+ sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">RC is a buildable character, which is great, he was included in the original Toy Story sets when Toy Story 3 came out, that model was much larger and perhaps a little out of scale with the rest of the toys in Minifigure form. This model is perhaps over-correcting for this because it might be a smidge too small when compared to Minifigures. His remote control is perfectly to scale though for the Minifigures and really great. Woody can hold it and fit inside RC as he&rsquo;s driving.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The overall look of RC here is really good, love all of the printed elements to make the character. It&rsquo;s also a simple toy to play with so kids are going to love this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is pretty fun, not sure if it&rsquo;s something you need if you already have Woody, since he is in other sets. I&rsquo;m going to recommend it though as a really great toy, loads of fun can be had just with this one set alone for the target demographic. Recommended.</p>

"Oregondete81","2019-07-11T20:49:05.937Z","Woody & RC Review","<p><strong>Set Overview:</strong></p>

<p>This set review is for set #10766: Woody &amp; RC. This is one of six Toy Story 4 sets released earlier this year before the premiere of Toy Story 4 on June 20th, 2019. The set is 69 pieces including one Woody minifigure, an RC build, 4 toy soldier nanofigs, and side builds for playability.</p>

<p><strong>Why I bought this set:</strong></p>

<p>I remember going to see the original Toy Story movie as a kid. I remember repeatedly watching it when it came out on VHS. I loved Toy Story as a kid. I have not seen the most recent film and it&rsquo;s been years since I&rsquo;ve watched any of them, but when I saw these sets were being released, all those memories of watching Toy Story as a kid came flooding back and I wanted each and every one of these sets.{Dark Ages during last Toy Story LEGO Toy Story run} I did not pull the trigger due to the fact that they were all Juniors sets and I&#39;ve never bought one before. I generally look at the price to part ratio and the build experience as major parts of my choice in LEGO sets and Juniors sets are generally the exact opposite of those values. I decided this week to test one out and went with cheapest of the lot. I bought this set for nostalgia purposes and a chance to see what these Juniors set experiences are like.</p>

<p><b>Minifigs</b><strong>/</strong><b>Nanofigs</b><strong>:</strong></p>

<p><em>**Pros: </em></p>

<p><em>-</em>The Woody minifig is fantastic! The print is on his torso is excellent, he has dual molded legs and a hat hairpiece combo that are all top notch printing. Only downside was the face which I will address below.</p>

<p>-The set includes 4 toy soldier nanofigs overall. I think these are such a great sue of nanofigs to include characters from the movie while avoiding more minifigs and therefore increasing cost. I can see these pieces being very valuable for a future MOC.</p>

<p><em>**Cons:</em></p>

<p>-The face for Woody just doesn&#39;t quite do him justice. Overall I prefer the new line of Toy Story minifigs over the old ones with molded heads. However, some of the new ones capture the essence of the character better than others. I think is one of those misses. It&rsquo;s not a bad minifig in itself, but it doesn&#39;t immediately capture the film characters essence.</p>

<p>-I, as an AFOL, love the inclusion of the toy soldiers in this set. However, I don&#39;t understand the inclusion of them in a Juniors set. I understand one aspect of Juniors&#39; sets is to utilize larger pieces due to the difference in dexterity for children at that young age and these toy soldiers do not need to be connected to anything so they don&#39;t violate that principle. But they are tiny little pieces that are still difficult to handle and balance and easy to lose. I think this would have been a more justifiable inclusion in a standard 5-12 set. Even though I love their inclusion, I don&#39;t know that a Parent or preschooler will get the same enjoyment out of their inclusion.</p>

<p><strong>Set-Build:</strong></p>

<p><i>**Pros:</i></p>

<p>-This is where I have to say the Juniors Set exceeded my expectations. The RC build was fantastic. It was extremely simple, but very effective build. It is a great representation of RC and has a lot of playability.</p>

<p>-Printed pieces are awesome! I will have to keep this in mind about Juniors sets from now on. Honestly, some of these prints are well worth the mark up when factored in.</p>

<p>-The side builds provide tremendous playability. The ability to stack the boxes and knock them over or use the cones to set up a race track are really efficient use of side builds.</p>

<p>**<em>Cons:</em></p>

<p>-The side builds are great for playability but almost annoyingly simple builds. 1/3 of this set can be put together in 15 seconds. Then again, being my first Juniors set, maybe that&#39;s just part of what I need to understand about them.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Thoughts:</strong></p>

<p>I have a lot of thoughts about this set, but overall I liked it. I think it nailed certain aspects and came up short in a few others, but for a Juniors set it exceeded my expectations. Due to the inclusion of the nanofigs, I really wish they had made this a standard set with a slightly more complex RC build, but for a Juniors set it exceeded my expectations on detail, build experience, and final product. I&rsquo;m really happy with this purchase and look forward to displaying my Woody &amp; RC with the rest of my collection. The only group I would discourage from buying this set are parents worried about the nanofigs. If you look at this set and any of your thoughts gravitate towards &quot;Will my kid stick those up his nose?&quot; the answer is &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; and you might want to buy a different set.</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2020-04-05T17:33:02.353Z","Great set , especially if you're a Pixar fan","<p>The smallest and cheapest set of the&nbsp;Toy Story 4 wave definitely surprised me on how much better the set is than what I initially expected. I picked this set up because the value in this set is actually pretty fantastic&nbsp;and&nbsp;I was a HUGE fan of Toy Story that missed out on most of the 2010 Toy Story sets, so this was a nice&nbsp;and cute alternative to the much bigger (and very expensive to get sealed nowadays) original version.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>RC: </strong>RC&nbsp;uses a big juniors base piece in black where 4 red wheels are attached to the build. The completed model looks very good with the impressive printing all around&nbsp;like&nbsp;his &#39;face&#39;&nbsp;using two 2 by 2 printed circular tiles for the eyes , the hood and at the back using a 2 by 4 printed tile for the continuation of the blue design. Unlike the 2010 version,&nbsp;A seating area and control remote&nbsp;was provided,&nbsp;the seating area&nbsp;can&nbsp;fit Woody in the vehicle just perfectly and the remote build&nbsp;was a nice addition. Behind the seating area is the antenna in a pretty odd placement. Overall RC looks pretty accurate to the character from the movies (other than the placement of the antenna) and the very simple design worked very well.</p>

<p><strong>Traffic Cones and Toy Blocks: </strong>What&#39;s left are the side builds of toy blocks and traffic cones. The 6 blocks included are 2 red ones, 2 yellow ones, 1 blue and 1 green. The cones and the blocks are very minor side builds and they&#39;re pretty straight forward, but they definitely add to the playability of the set.</p>

<h3>The Minifig(s)</h3>

<p><strong>Woody:</strong> While&nbsp;Woody is a common figure to get in this wave ,getting my hands on the 2019 Woody was an absolute joy.The legs came out great&nbsp;using a dual-molded design with blue for his jeans and brown for the boots.&nbsp;His front and back torso printing are both very impressive and accurate to the iconic character. For the front , he has his cowboy vest , Sheriff badge and belt printing and the back continues the belt and cowboy vest design as well as the pull-string printed on there which is awesome. His face has a smiling expression and a confident open smile, both expressions are great but not exclusive (came in Duke Caboom&#39;s&nbsp;Stunt Show). And the hair/hat combo was easily the best part of the figure, and I really liked how the hat was placed a little crooked just like in the movies. Overall, I think he turned out great with his translation from molded head to regular head, and while not exclusive, I loved getting him in this set.</p>

<p><strong>The Green Army Men:</strong> we get 3 green army men. Well, actually 4 because one&#39;s an extra , so that was a nice surprise. This version of the army men are&nbsp;small statuette figures in plain green, the fact that they&#39;re appropriately small here unlike the 2010 figures that were full sized minifigures, makes this set capture a very accurate scale in the perspective of a toy.</p>

<h3>Value for Money</h3>

<p>This set actually has a fantastic value! You get a handful of characters from Toy Story and while the builds aren&#39;t highly detailed because it&#39;s a 4+ set, the amount of things you get here feels like it&#39;s more than worth the price, which is always a good thing.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>As a 4+ set, it&#39;s REALLY great. The build&nbsp;for RC looks good all around, the prints are fantastic as always,&nbsp;Woody and the army men are great , the value is there and this set is a good alternative to the 2010 version. This set also captures an accurate scale that other sets of the wave don&#39;t have, so that&#39;s pretty unique.&nbsp;If you aren&#39;t a Toy Story or even a Pixar fan, you might probably skip this set , but if you are, I&#39;d say to get it&nbsp;as it&#39;s generally a good deal, but trust me this set looks way better in person. As a huge Toy Story fan myself, I love this set a lot and I highly recommend it.</p>
