These sets are inspired by the fourth film in the series and yet as they are 4+ sets they don&rsquo;t include a lot of scenes from the actual film. Or a lot of characters. Hamm, Mr. Potato Head, Mrs. Potato Head and many of the larger characters are absent. Which is a true shame as the Toy Story 3 tie-in sets managed to include most of those characters.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, these new sets are still pretty fun, but AFOLs such as myself are more interested in collecting them for the characters rather than the models.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Toy Story 4 boxes are a nice light blue colour which resembles Andy&rsquo;s room&rsquo;s decorative wall paper, which is a tad odd since Andy isn&rsquo;t even in this movie. Or is he? Each box shows off the animated versions of the characters included in each set, meaning Duke Caboom and Woody are prominent on the front of the box.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The front shows a decent action shot while the back breaks down everything included in the set by model sections. The manual shows off the steps to build which are fairly easy to follow along with for younger builders.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Included in this set are some nice elements, a large printed wall element with Caboom on it and two of the 4+ baseplates typical of these sets. Some really big curved elements are also included, I&rsquo;m talking parts you&rsquo;d probably use to make a sloped roof on a large town house or farm house if you were inclined to MOC something of that nature. Overall though not a whole lot of elements.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Duke Caboom: This new character looks wonderful and quite smartly dressed in his white stunt show suit. It reminds me of the Stunt Racer from the Collectible Minifigures, the design isn&rsquo;t identical of course, this print has red stripes running down the sides of his legs and minor printing on his feet, his torso features the red striping on his back while the front includes a Canadian Maple Leaf symbol on his belt buckle. He has a helmet with clear red visor, red soft-goods cape and a unique hair piece to swap with. Overall a strong Minifigure and a fun one. His bike also has a printed round tile with Canadian Maple Leaf. Very solid.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Woody: Sharing the same parts as another Woody, this Minifigure has a different face only, with a closed mouth smile on one side and an open tooth revealing smile on the other. Woody is really a great Minifigure, there are some who have complained that they should have just re-issued the older parts with the unique sculpted head and longer legs. Personally I don&rsquo;t agree with that, not because it would detract from the value, but because this way we get to see them tackle the character a new way. This version of Woody gets a new hat piece after all, and he fits in better with the other Minifigures. Sure he isn&rsquo;t accurate enough anymore, but he makes for a very smart looking Minifig.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Woody and Duke Caboom work together to make a small ramp, some drums, a sign and Duke&rsquo;s Motorcycle. This is a supremely fast build, it shouldn&rsquo;t be difficult to construct this model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: A &lsquo;flaming wheel of death&rsquo; stunt jump and two toy cars are built here. Again these are fairly quick and easy to build items, shouldn&rsquo;t take longer than thirty minutes max.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set features a very impressive ramp for jumping over. Duke Caboom will burst through his signature stunt entrance rush up the ramp and jump over a pair of cars before leaping through a ring of fire. Or, if you&rsquo;d prefer, he can jump over some barrels instead. The model is pretty nice, though a bit loose, the cars like to slide off their resting area when you pick up the ramp since they don&rsquo;t attach by studs. It&rsquo;s a great little set and well worth the asking price.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a good set, much better than the Roller Coaster for unique characters, although it is the third set to feature Woody. Duke Caboom is a great figure and all of the accessories he gets in this set is just perfect, really makes him look like the action figure from the movie with the commercial showing off much of these items, such as the ramp and the toy cars to leap over. Recommended.</p>
