"BlobfishBricks","2020-05-07T22:19:25.867Z","My First Juniors Set and Surprisingly Good.","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; This was my first juniors set and I didn&#39;t have very high hopes for it. The only reason I got it was because it was on clearance for nine dollars and I figured it was worth it for the Buzz and Bo. I&#39;m happy to say it was better than I expected.</p>

<h2>The Box and Build:</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; One thing I do like about 4+ sets is the box is always rather large, and I like that. In it is one instruction manual, and, surprisingly, three bags. Naturally, the build is quick due to its use of large pieces. The only thing that even uses any smaller pieces is the skunk car.</p>

<h2>The Minifigures:</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Three minifigures are included in this set. First is Buzz. He is not exclusive, appearing in three other sets, and I was disappointed in the quality of his face color. Nevertheless, his jetpack/wing thing does look good, and he even had a fair amount of detail under that. Next up is Bo Peep. Natural she comes with a cape and staff, and I love the hair piece. The only fig exclusive to the set is Gabby Gabby. She has a dress and polka dot shirt, but overall not much special. This is OK though, because it is fairly accurate to the film.</p>

<h2>The Complete Model</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When complete, the main playground structure is fairly large. There isn&#39;t much you can&#39;t see in the images, but inside the shelter on the left is a small oven, maybe?. The two sections can be split apart, but when together the ladder makes a bridge. Two slide pieces are used to make the slide, one curved, one straight. Apart from this big playground there is a skunk car, by far the most advanced build in the set (and yet, not at all). There is also a mery go round that spins.</p>

<h2>Overall</h2>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As I didn&#39;t have high hopes for the set, it was actually a fun little set. Obviously it is more of a playset, not for collectors. Thee minifigs are pretty good, not too special. Naturally it has good playability, being made with that in mind. No very special pieces are included. Overall, however, I would suggest this for anyone who loves playing with Lego.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-11-07T15:16:31.427Z","More Toy Story 4 Fun.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #10768 Buzz &amp; Bo Peep&rsquo;s Playground Adventure:</b> And again we come to a set that really isn&rsquo;t as accurate to what transpired in the movie. For one thing I don&rsquo;t recall Buzz hanging out with Bo that much, but I suppose that could just be me. Anyway this is a decent enough set for what it is, though only include three characters for the price in this set seems to be really skewing the price-per-piece ratio.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">In all fairness the 4+ sets have a fair number of large parts and printed elements.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Buzz, Bo and Gabby are all having fun playing at the Playground. The front shows the three characters in animated form so you know who to find in this set. The back shows off the set in all its glory, this is actually a fairly decent Playground build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is nice, but the packaging has a tendency to potentially bend or crease the manual because of how large it is. They work very well though, the pages are easy to follow along with while building.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set has many large elements, a massive wall printed with the side of a house complete with window frame, two large slides, a large bubble cockpit element, four large brown crossed wall elements. (Pieces commonly used in Jurassic World paddock fences.) Definitely explains why this set actually cost so much.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bo Peep: Seen in two sets from the Toy Story 4 line of LEGO 4+ Disney products, Bo has a rather nice look to her. She features an excellent dual-sided print design with matching legs which captures her look quite well, her face has two different expressions, a smile with open mouth showing teeth and a sort of smirking expression, her hair piece is brand new and looks quite appropriate, she also includes a large light teal hook-shaped cane accessory and a simple purple 4+ cape. Quite lovely.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Buzz Lightyear: This Minifigure hasn&rsquo;t changed much since the CMF, in fact I think the printing on him is almost exactly the same. I know the printing on his wings and space armor are exactly the same. The only variation is the facial expression, this version of Buzz has a closed mouth smile as opposed to the more cocky looking sure of himself open mouth teeth exposed smile on the CMF release.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Gabby Gabby: This character also has a nice look to her. She has a warm smile on both sides of her face, though one has a more up-turned corner of the lip almost giving a sinister look to her, though she&rsquo;s really very nice. Her yellow dress is amazing, and her legs include some print to show off the matching under skirt ruffles at her knees. Speaking of skirts the piece here is not new, but the colour sure is, this is the first time it&rsquo;s seen in yellow if I&rsquo;m not mistaken. Her hair piece is very nice too, though I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s a re-use or not. It has a hole on top to peg Friends style accessories into and yet it is not a Friends specific hair piece. If anything it might be the same hair piece as the one used by the CMF Babysitter in a new reddish tone, but I don&rsquo;t know. It&rsquo;s difficult to keep track of hair styles these days in LEGO.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Her back includes the pull string visible on the print, which is an excellent touch. Overall a really nice Minifigure representing a very nice character. A pity the database doesn&rsquo;t account for her yet.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Bo builds a merry-go-round and skunk car model here. This was really quick, I&rsquo;m talking fifteen minutes tops to complete the build, the merry-go-round was a nice little model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Buzz storms the house, the play structure house that is, once he&rsquo;s built it with you. This was definitely fun to build, was a quick model to make, and took only a little bit of time, but it is also a model that we&rsquo;ve never seen these in a lot of LEGO sets, this entire set would fit in well for a LEGO City park.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: Gabby comes out to help finish off the play structure and this part of the build is equally quick to complete, all in all you&rsquo;ll be having adventures with everybody in no time.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kids will adore this fun looking play structure. It features a miniature house, a slide, one of those bubble window structures with a ladder leading up and a ladder leading across to the house, a standalone merry-go-round is included, those spinny things we all loved as kids that made us dizzy when we pushed it around and around as fast as we could.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">You also get a skunk-mobile as seen in the movie, it&rsquo;s not as detailed or as involved as the fake skunk car Bo Peed used, but it is here and is represented rather nicely for such a small model using minimum pieces. There&rsquo;s a lot of fun to be had with this toy from Toy Story 4, older fans can appreciate its look as well with some hints of nostalgic pride. The colour choices are nice too, the orange contrasts quite nicely with the teal and really pops. This is a very impressive model for a 4+ set and I&rsquo;m amazed LEGO hasn&rsquo;t made anything similar in their City or Creator lines.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This offering is the only way to get the character of Gabby Gabby from the LEGO Toy Story 4 sub-theme of sets. It&rsquo;s a pretty decent play structure too and would look good in any LEGO Park display. A fun toy, capturing some of the moments from the movie, though not at proper scale. This play structure would be huge compared to the Minifigures since they are meant to represent toys and these toys live in a world populated by humans. However LEGO sets don&rsquo;t necessarily need to represent such things. Highly Recommended from me. Hopefully you&rsquo;ll find this to be equally enjoyable in your own rights.</p>
