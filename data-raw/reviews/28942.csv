Even though the set is obviously juniorized&nbsp;, the build is still strong enough to be enjoyable for teens and adults, the figures won&#39;t be the only draw!</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p><strong>The RV:</strong>&nbsp;Even though the RV isn&#39;t the&nbsp;most compelling build due to big junior builds, it can still appeal to the older collectors. The front of the RV has a 2 by 4 printed tile of the grill and license plate&nbsp;which is a nice print and 2&nbsp;translucent orange 1 by 2 tiles as the lights. For the interior of the RV, there&#39;s a nice driver&#39;s seat and simple builds for a sink and a toilet, the inside has enough space to pose some figures , though you sometimes can&#39;t fit the top of the RV completely&nbsp;when you stand&nbsp;Jessie , which I wish they made the top have 1 more layer so that you could, but you can easily fix that, so it&#39;s not a big deal. The left side of the RV has an open space where you can find a cup and croissant , which is always nice to get the croissant piece. The design of the opening almost reminds me of a food truck.The right side of the RV&nbsp;has some blue windows and a nice print&nbsp;that says&nbsp;RV&nbsp;with&nbsp;an air&nbsp;vent. The back looks complete with another window and more tile pieces to finish it off, along with&nbsp;a short blue ladder leading us to the removable top. The top of the vehicle has a&nbsp;yellow awning and some space at the back to pose your figures. Luckily , Lego didn&#39;t omit a sleeping space , and they provided one within&nbsp;the top of the vehicle. The cover would be taken off to put a figure in bed&nbsp;there which is awesome. Overall, it&#39;s not a perfect build, but it&#39;s fun and better than most junior vehicles imo and actually quite enjoyable.</p>

<p><strong>The Entrance&nbsp;Gate: </strong>This&nbsp;build was very simple, the gate can turn around to open of course , next to it is a little red flower and a nice&nbsp;pine tree build, the top of the entrance sign has a great print that says Grand Basin and an RV printed on there, which is a pretty useful part.</p>

<p><strong>The Campsite:</strong> Finally, we have the campsite build. Filled again with simple designs that are pretty cute. It includes another one of the nice pine tree build and next to it is an implication of a cabin going on, which could&#39;ve been expanded upon , but it&#39;s just a junior build. A little lamp could also be found close to the bench build , where there&#39;s a plate with an apple on it and another cup piece, included with the table is a wooden seat with the existing log circular tile print. Lastly there&#39;s a&nbsp;grill section with a schmoe and a hot dog. Overall, it&#39;s a nice build that makes a good place to display the figures that come in this set.</p>

<h2>The Figures</h2>

<p>Though the set as a whole is still great, the figures are mostly going to be the main draw for this set , and the figures that are included here are PHENOMENAL!</p>

<p><strong>Jessie:&nbsp;</strong>You get Jessie the Yodeling Cowgirl&nbsp;, and her translation to regular minifigure head was&nbsp;well-handled&nbsp;,&nbsp;she uses&nbsp;a dual-molded leg design for the boots and her torso&nbsp;looks great, it has her back torso printing for the pull&nbsp;string which is something the original was missing. The legs and torso in general look very accurate to the character. Her facial expressions&nbsp;include&nbsp;a closed&nbsp;smile and an open one for the alternate face, both fitting for the character.&nbsp;The new mold introduced with Jessie is an awesome hair/hat combo, which turned out great, the hair at the back also has an accessory hole so that you can put a bow on her. Overall, she&#39;s an&nbsp;amazing exclusive minifigure and I&#39;m very happy to own it.</p>

<p><br />
<strong>Alien:&nbsp;</strong>The Little Green Man in this set , while not exclusive (came in the Carnival Thrill Coaster set) ,&nbsp;is always nice to get another of. It uses the same head mold from the 2010 sets , but with different printing for the eyes to give it pupils. Overall, he&#39;s not my favorite version of Alien, but I still like him.</p>

<p><strong>Forky: </strong>Forky&nbsp;is a new mold that&#39;s only one piece, and he&#39;s so adorable, he&#39;s got his printed googly eyes and his long red arms, he can attach to one stud as well as be held by a minifigure&nbsp;in between his arms and legs. Overall, this single piece perfectly captured the look of the character imo and he&#39;s very cute.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rex:&nbsp;</strong>And then we get the standout figure of the set that is Rex. I was extremely happy with his inclusion in this set, as I was one of the people who missed out on most of the 2010 Toy Story sets, and now a lot of people can get him very easily. Anyway, the two things that make him better than the original Rex is that he has eyebrow printing and a more accurate color printed for his belly, the old functions of the original Rex is the same here, you get the tiny rubber movable hands , the two movable legs and the detachable tail connected with a&nbsp;technic pin. Overall, I&#39;m very happy to have a second chance at getting Rex, getting him here was awesome!</p>

<h2>Value For Money&nbsp;</h2>

<p>For what&#39;s included in this set, you get quite a lot. You get a good RV&nbsp;build&nbsp;and 2 other side builds ,and 4 amazing figures (3 which are exclusive to the set). What you have here feels like it&#39;s enough to fit the price , which will leave you satisfied.</p>

<h2>Overall Opinion</h2>

<p>As I said, this set is a juniors set that can also appeal to an older demographic ,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the figures&nbsp;of the set are pretty much good enough to sell the set. As a HUGE Toy Story fan, I love this set so much and it brings a fine addition to my collection. The price is good, but I&#39;d say to look for it on sale first.&nbsp;I would say this is the best set of the Toy Story 4 wave and it will definitely satisfy Toy Story fans who&nbsp;missed out on the 2010 sets like me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well Forky, I hope your question has been answered and you found this review helpful.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-11-22T11:41:56.03Z","The Toys are Going on Vacation!","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #10769 Toy Story 4 RV Vacation:</b> This is a pretty great set, it features loads of unique characters and some awesome models to enjoy. It&rsquo;s also the only set to feature the newest character for the Toy Story universe, Forky. Onwards to the review where we discuss everything about this model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The packaging for this line is great, really stands out and attracts the eye, especially with the huge characters on the side showing you everyone included in the set from their animation models.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is smaller here, in previous sets I forgot to mention that the manuals were much larger, with the size of this box you figure to find a larger booklet. But instead it&rsquo;s a smaller size, but equally easy to follow along with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with most 4+ sets you&rsquo;ll find a larger baseplate, there&rsquo;s also a solid single large piece chassis for the RV. Everything else is fairly common, there&rsquo;s a few printed elements, a sign for the Grand Basin, the front grille of the RV and that&rsquo;s pretty much it for prints. Nice parts, I suppose, aside from the baseplate I&rsquo;m not sure what else might be useful for MOC builders. Oh, pine trees, LEGO small pine tree elements are included, almost forgot.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Forky: Much like Ducky, this new character is a single sculpt with two different colours of abs plastic being used, one is white the other red for the arms. The figure doesn&rsquo;t do anything, it can&rsquo;t hold anything, but the facial print is nice and accurate. It can attach to a single stud with the feet and, in a very clever move, his lower body is the same shape as a bar. Which means that Minifigures can actually hold Forky in their hand. Very great idea.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Jessie: Woody&rsquo;s pal Jessie can yodel, and she&rsquo;s got a really impressive looking print. The torso and dual-molded legs look spot on for the character and her head piece includes a hole to attach a bow. Her facial print has an open mouth smile and a regular smile. No accessories for her aside from the bow, but you can see her pull string on her back, which is a very nice touch. Especially since her braid hides that area of the back print.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">LGM: Not much to say about him, he&rsquo;s the same little alien character we&rsquo;ve seen since the first Toy Story LEGO sets, same head sculpt, same basic print, same short legs. Overall a great looking figure, but common.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Rex: This isn&rsquo;t exactly a Minifigure per-se, but it does work out quite well as a character. Rex has a single torso with arms and head, you attach his legs and tail and then you&rsquo;ve got the nervous carnivore. His mouth can&rsquo;t open, he can&rsquo;t hold any accessories, but he&rsquo;s a pretty nifty looking character. If you own the T-Rex from Jurassic World have some fun exploring the encounter of two film legends.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: You can build Jessie and the lower half of the RV. This is a quick build and extremely simple to follow along with. The design is very well done for a 4+ set. Not much else to say there.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: In this bag you&rsquo;ll find Rex and the parts to make the top of the RV as well as the Skateboard, Camera and Grand Basin sign. This is a very quick build, not a whole lot to it actually. The top of the RV took longer than the sign, but overall it wasn&rsquo;t longer than 30 minutes or more to finish it all.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: This is the final element of the build. Forky and the LGM are included and you build the cabin fa&ccedil;ade and campground area for eating and preparing food. It&rsquo;s all built up onto the large green baseplate and uses relatively few parts, making it simple enough and quick enough to complete the build and then get started playing. Not much else to say, on to the completed model section.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">RV: This is a very clever looking model, it has a similar design to LEGO City RV models, only this one is open from one side and rather cramped due to the nature of the single chassis piece. It has all the comforts of home inside, a driver&rsquo;s station, a sink and a toilet. The upper area seems to have a pool, there&rsquo;s also a mug and a croissant&hellip; there aren&rsquo;t a whole lot of details here, just the grille and license plate. A pretty decent model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Campgrounds Area: This model is pretty fun looking. We have a large gate to pass through the area where a barbecue pit, cabin and eating area is set up. There&rsquo;s space enough for all the characters to sit and enjoy the hot dog and roasting marshmallow that is included with the set. And when that&rsquo;s done they can take a picture with the camera or go ride a skateboard. Overall a lot of fun can be had with these pair of models.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a must own set for Jessie alone. But with Rex and Forky here too you&rsquo;ll definitely want to own this set. The Grand Basin sign is rather clever as far as puns go though I&rsquo;m not entirely certain if it was used in the movie. I&rsquo;ll have to watch it again to find out. I&rsquo;m not entirely sure why they included a toilet also, considering these are all toys and don&rsquo;t really need to use the bathroom. Oh well, it was probably the best option for filling the space inside. I&rsquo;d strongly recommend picking this up for Jessie, Rex, Forky and the models. Definitely a very well put together set. Strongly Recommended.</p>

<p>The parts are ok, along with the building experience and playability. Rex is awesome to have, but not for the price. This set could&#39;ve benefited a lot more if it was $5 less. $30 sounds way better for what&#39;s included and the part count.&nbsp;</p>
