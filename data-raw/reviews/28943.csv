"J14T14","2019-04-30T15:15:52.26Z","The Perfect Toy Story 4 Set","<p>If you could only buy one set from the new Toy Story 4 line of sets, this would be the one to get. It is full&nbsp;desirable&nbsp;characters, the builds are simple, but okay, and it is full of fun play features.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Woody, Buzz, ane Boe Peep appear in other sets, but this is the only one where all three appear together. Like many, I would have liked to have gotten special molds for the characters like we got for the previous Toy Story sets, but it isn&#39;t a huge turnoff for me so I can live with the direction they chose to take. My favorite new piece it Boe Peep&#39;s shepherd&#39;s crook. It can fit around a minifigures neck, so it can be used to recreate scenes from the first two movies. Key and Peele&#39;s characters,&nbsp;Ducky and Bunny, only appear in this set. I love these comedians so I love getting them in LEGO in some form. The head of Bunny is great and looks good when compared to the trailers. The Ducky character mold is cute, and I think that it looks great (I am probably going to have to watch my back after saying this, but i think that it looks great when aired up with <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/name-Chuck"">Chuck</a>&nbsp;minifigure from the Angry Birds Movie line of sets)</p>

<p>The builds are &quot;juniorized&quot; and use large pieces, but this is okay given the age range that LEGO was going for. The large, printed doorway piece it the only one I&nbsp;this set that I have no idea how to use outside of this set, but I will figure it out eventually. The build itself for the shooting gallery is cool and I like the inclusion of the cannon shooter-piece.The bumper-cars are cute little builds, the ice cream shop is nice, and it includes two unprinted pieced that were first introduced in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70822-1/Unikitty-s-Sweetest-Friends-EVER!"">70822-1</a>&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70822-1/Unikitty-s-Sweetest-Friends-EVER!"">Unikitty&#39;s Sweetest Friends EVER!</a>&nbsp;for Ice Cream Cone. These will be useful and hopefully we got more of these pieces in different colors. Now last but not least, the spider spinner ride. People have called this an octopus, but the prints for those dome pieces look more like a spider to me. You can move the arms up and down and seat a minifigure in baskets at the end of the arms. Because most of the mass is towards the outside of the build, it spins really nicely and for a really long time. This is cool as kids will have a fun time playing with this.</p>

<p>Overall, this set is great for kids to play with, but not so great for adults. The only reason why adults would pick it up is for the minifigures, and I think that it completely&nbsp;justified here. The minifigures are great and the builds are fun for kids. This set is fantastic and I am so glad that I picked it up.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-11-22T13:21:10.7Z","To the Carnival! And FUN!","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #10770 Buzz &amp; Woody&rsquo;s Carnival Mania!:</b> The largest and priciest set from LEGO&rsquo;s Toy Story 4 sets is an interesting collection of models. While there was a carnival in the film though, this set looks kind of like a tie-in to the Toy Story Ride in Disney World? Or was it Disneyland? I can&rsquo;t quite recall. That being said, it&rsquo;s a fun looking set and let&rsquo;s discuss all aspects of it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This shows off images of Ducky, Bunny, Bo, Buzz and Woody on the front of the Andy&rsquo;s Room wallpaper box design. It also shows the models in a fun environment display, which makes tons of sense since the set is a collection of Carnival rides. The back shows everything in the set in detail and even shows a fun little play scene in the corner.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is very nice, showing the build steps quite accurately. There is no real issue with them.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set features some nice parts from the 4+ line. The large wall element is printed with some decent looking space effects, there&rsquo;s a printed sign for the Star Adventure game, two printed round cockpit elements with bars for the Octopus ride and a printed Ice Cream stand sign. A pretty good selection of parts for AFOLs who enjoy MOCing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bo Peep: This character shares all of her parts with the previous set I reviewed featuring her, I think even her head is the same, it certainly seems to be identical for at least one of the prints. The other side has an open-mouthed smile, which I believe is not the same as the alternate expression on the previous version.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bunny: With short legs this character looks pretty impressive, in point of fact this is a rather rare looking Minifigure because he is made mostly from a dark blue colour. This is unique to the character, he has some printing on the back of his torso to show his tail and a tag, that&rsquo;s correct, a tag. Most stuffed animals do have tags after all, very nice touch of detail for the character.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Buzz Lightyear: Buzz&rsquo;s print and Minifigure looks the same here for all of his parts as the one from the CMF and Buzz &amp; Bo Peep&rsquo;s Playground set. The only difference here is the facial expression, he has a smirking confident expression. No accessories to hold, but that&rsquo;s ok. Ah, one difference between the sets and the CMF from Disney Series 1, this version doesn&rsquo;t include arm printing for his laser.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ducky: This is a solid sculpted piece in scale with Minifigures. It can attach via the bottom to studs or a Minifigures&rsquo; hand, so that you can attach him to Bunny. A nice looking printed element here, very accurate to the animated model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Woody: All of the pieces and prints are the same for Woody here between the three sets his Minifigure is included in. His sheriff&rsquo;s outfit looks great, he has dual-molded legs and a regular Minifigure head with hat/hair head piece. No accessories for him to hold, but he does feature a unique head print. Each set has a different expression or set of expressions for Woody, this version has a nervous expression on side and a smiling expression with an open mouth showing off his teeth.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Each Minifigure is paired up with an appropriate carnival ride. Buzz and the Star Adventure game are part of this first build. It&rsquo;s a fairly quick build, in keeping with 4+ sets, and so this set stands out as a quick easy to build selection of models. This model uses the large baseplate and gate element, so it will use a small number of other parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: This model build uses the chassis elements of the Mighty Micros, it&rsquo;s nice to see them incorporate those elements into another build. This is the only repetitive build, after constructing Woody you build two bumper cars. Really quick and easy to construct.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: Bo and her Ice Cream Stand build are included in this set, it&rsquo;s a quick build and really quite fun. Love the use of ice cream cones, scoops and cherries for decorations on the sign. As a bonus you could pretend they are actual ice cream cones when playing. But this build is relatively quick, as is the point of 4+ sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #4: Ducky and Bunny are included in this bag and the build here is the massive Octopus ride. This is a sweet build, if a tad on the repetitive side due to the nature of such rides. Also this Octopus build is missing four arms, quite unfortunate for a ride model of this type. I&rsquo;m sure someone has managed to find a way to take two of these and merge them into a properly armed cephalopod.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Star Adventure Game: Buzz&rsquo;s Star Adventure is a very interesting cannon ball launching game to knock down the four space rockets and win a prize. This model is a very solid one, it looks pretty impressive and features some very nice play features. A small container of cylinders sits beside a cannon and Buzz can launch them at the rockets to hit them and win one of the many prizes printed on the large gate element, stuffed bears, dolphins, ice cream cones, stars or planets. (None of which are included in this set to actually use as prizes sadly.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bumper Cars: These models are based on the Mighty Micros car chassis, which works perfectly as remote controlled bumper cars. They run around on wheels instead of sliders like past bumper car models, and feature steering wheels. Overall some fun looking little models. Also fun to play with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ice Cream Stand: Bo&rsquo;s special Ice Cream Stand looks great, it&rsquo;s a solid looking kiosk where you can purchase ice cream of all shapes and sizes, as evidenced by the sign up top. The combination of yellow and teal coloured elements for the sign works well and there are some spoons and an ice cream float to drink already on the table. Two seats allow Woody and Bo to enjoy Ice Cream together. And two spoons are included with this set so they can do just that.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Octopus Ride: This ride can spin and you can raise and lower the seats while the Minifigures are inside. It&rsquo;s an ok build, the model looks pretty good too with its funky four-eyed octopus face on either side of the rounded head. It&rsquo;s creepy, fun and can fit all of the figures included in this set. A solid model and great for a carnival ride display.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a nice set for a carnival set up. It features some very impressive models for a 4+ set and a good selection of Minifigures. My only real problem with the line is that half the cast of characters are absent, there is no stuffed unicorn, no Hamm, no Slinky Dog, not much of anything. Still, for a return of Toy Story to LEGO form these sets really work well, great fun to collect and decent price range for all of them. As far as this set is concerned, I highly recommend it, it features most of the main cast and some very nice models. Highly Recommended.</p>

<p>The building experience was great due to the variety of things you build. The parts are good, and the playability is plenty due to the games included. However, the price is mediocre and should&#39;ve been $40.</p>
