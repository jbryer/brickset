Gee, sounds like I&rsquo;m repeating myself again, if you can find it I&rsquo;d say you can&rsquo;t go wrong picking it up and here are the reasons why.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Fun little model to build with an awesome design.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Decent Minifigure included for a female racer.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Easy to find originally at retail in many locations.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Price-Per-Piece ratio a bit problematic with only 34 pieces.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">No alternate hair element for the female racer.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As I noted this was a really great looking polybag and included some extra side-models to act as markers for the race. Get a bunch of them and you can have a full racing team. Unfortunately you&rsquo;d need to get some spare Minifigure elements to make them all unique. Recommended.</p>
