While small, sets like this allowed for some really fantastic car builds in a really tiny and inexpensive space, like the slightly dorky-looking 31055 Red Racer and its amazing elder, 31027 Blue Racer, which even managed to have an opening rear engine hatch. Even the polybag sets had some charm to them, like 30187 Fast Car and 30183 Little Car.</p>

<p>However, this set takes a different approach. And maybe it&#39;s not for the best...</p>

<p>The set takes more of a Tiny Turbos approach to building, with SNOT brackets used to create the bumpers and side panels. A Racers piece also serves as the front fascia. Two new cutout half-arches are used to round out the roofline, with the cutouts perfectly accommodating the rear fenders. A pair of new round tiles with pins compose the tailpipes. What makes this little set really notable is the use of azure blue for the highlights, which is a very pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>However, this Race Car seems to have taken all the wrong notes from the Tiny Turbos era. Although it appears to be an LMP style racer, the parts used in the car&#39;s midsection and fenders give it an extremely bulky profile, making it look more like a strangely low slung pickup truck or cabin-forward muscle car. In addition, while previous Creator mini cars have featured brick-built head and taillights (31000 Mini Speeder stands out as a gorgeous example,) this set has no taillights and only a specialized front fender to do so.</p>

<p>While this Race Car may scratch an itch for a small Creator car build, it is by no means the best work of the theme.</p>
