I was captivated by the oo&#39;s and ahh&#39;s of the exclusive &quot;you can only buy this here&quot; branding of Legoland. It took much self control, but managed to leave with just this one.</p>

<p>It is a simple set, and not much more than what&#39;s pictured. Building the small cars are a reasonable fun experience, but does feel a little recycled and there is no real&nbsp;feeling of a unique experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some of the parts that you get have&nbsp;some form of uniqueness to them as they are legoland parts, but there are no real unique or uncommon parts in this set except for the decals, perhaps, that I found.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall a cute set, but wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to find it. My son&nbsp;ended up dismantling it much faster than I anticipated. Not necessarily a disappointment, but was left wanting more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not Recommended.&nbsp;</p>
