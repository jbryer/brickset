"J14T14","2019-04-24T17:15:59.793Z","Who Ever Designed This Set Needs A Promotion!","<p>LEGO&nbsp;Minecraft&nbsp;has been around for a while, but this is the first polybag that we have gotten, and boy oh boy did they nail it! Most polybags hve a small build and maybe one minifigure. This set includes a small play scene and two minifigures! I can not recall&nbsp;any other polybag that includes this!</p>

<p>The build includes a sandy and grassy area with a small rock build. There is a build for a TNT block which includes two 1x2 printed bricks. When you push down on a 2x4 tile, the rock &quot;exploads&quot; and the small build launches off. This goes well with the creeper minifigure included. there is also a small plant build&nbsp;and torch build included.</p>

<p>The two minifigures are iconic to Minecraft as a whole and were perfect to include in this set. Steve is just in his standard attire and has a minecraft sward included as an accessory. The Creeper is also just standard and there is nothing special about it.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a perfect polybag for the Minecraft theme ans I hope that LEGO makes more of them. If you really want to, you could buy many copies of this set to build up an army af creepers and Steves. I recommend this set to anyone who wants a taste of the Minecraft theme or want to just have nice small build to add to their collection.</p>

<p>Plain and simple; gets the job done. Polybag and postcard-like instructions is all you need for a set this size.</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>Simple pieces. Love the printed TNT bricks, and the inclusion of two large plates for such a small set. The rest of the pieces are common, but useful. If I could afford it, I&#39;d buy a hundred of these just for the parts!</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>It has two: a classic Steve and Creeper. This is great. A very cheap way to obtain two of the most iconic figured from Minecraft. That&#39;s honestly why I bought it. The only other Minecraft sets I had only had armored Steve or Alex, and the super charged creeper, not a regular one. Very nice to have just the classic versions of both.</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>Simple build that was able to include the TNT exploding function. It was very interesting to see how they fit that into such a small model with so few pieces.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model:</strong></p>

<p>The scene itself could be added onto other Minecraft sets seamlessly, making it a perfect add-on kind of set. You could even buy a few more of these to make a long coastline. Plus, it has Steve and the Creeper to go with it and add on to the collectability or playability.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>This is probably my favorite LEGO polybag ever. A nice Minecraft scene even with a built in function, with Steve and a Creeper all in one. Probably the best $4 I&#39;ve ever spent! I liked it so much that I bought a second copy just to keep sealed. I would totally recommend this set to any LEGO, Minecraft, or LEGO Minecraft fan. It&#39;s a small set, but it is a great value.</p>

This year marks the first release of a LEGO Minecraft Polybag. Which is a great idea and I&rsquo;m amazed they did not try to include any sooner. Let&rsquo;s go over the Pros and Cons and then discuss the final thoughts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Includes two Minifigures, Steve &amp; a Creeper.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Model works as a great little set piece for the encounter between the two Minifigures.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Includes TNT Brick and explosive play feature.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Great value for your money.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">No unique printing on Minifigures.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Limited number of accessories for this set.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Sold out fast making it difficult to find at Retail.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I love the idea behind this set. It adds more to your LEGO Minecraft collection and let&rsquo;s you get the main character and an enemy for him to fight/defend against. You also get the printed TNT buildable element. Still this is a great parts pack for LEGO Minecraft fans, and I would strongly recommend trying to get multiples of it if you can to add more bricks to your Minecraft collection. I hope we get to see future Minecraft Polybags as the line continues.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Highly Recommended.</p>

"sirfangar","2019-08-27T00:01:43.107Z","Quintessential","<p>Back when <strong>LEGO </strong>launched their <strong>minifigure-scale&nbsp;</strong><strong>Minecraft</strong>&nbsp;sets nearing the end of 2014, I was beyond&nbsp;&nbsp;excited, but ended up purchasing only the <strong>21113 Cave</strong>. What I had wanted most out of the theme were the player-insert himself, Steve, and the Creeper.</p>

<p>It took nearly 5 years, but LEGO has at last provided us with an inexpensive way to get these 2 icons of the game. Though Steve is quite frequently seen throughout the line, albeit with slight variations, mostly armor add-ons&nbsp;and a rather diverse weapon selection, him and Creeper are enough to justify the price of a polybag. Licensed themes have had figures packaged the same way sell for 4-5 dollars, so this pack seems like a no-brainer.</p>

<p>The figurines are complimented with a rather spacious side build, all things considered. Alas, the play feature is nothing innovative, but does present a bit of action, showing that at least a modicum of thought was put into the scenery. <strong>I find this set to be the perfect entry point for anyone on the fence about the theme, surpassing last year&#39;s Melon Farm</strong> (much better value if you ask me).</p>

<p>You can&#39;t really go wrong with this one - the classic poster boys of the game alone are enough to attract attention of kids, teens and adults alike.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"miuboy","2019-10-21T16:40:34.78Z","unique minecraft polybag","<p>when i heard the news about this set, i was conflicted...</p>

<p>they created a minecraft Polybag! whats there not to love? then i saw it in person and instantly knew&nbsp;that this set is rather pitiful...&nbsp;</p>

<p>COST</p>

<p>this set costed 3,99$ at my local Walmart, although i don&#39;t recommend this [unless you don&#39;t have a creeper] as i will expain in a moment...</p>

<p>PACKAGE</p>

<p>the standard Lego&nbsp;poly bag, although no complaints about it, other than it looking like a duplo bag</p>

<p>PARTS</p>

<p>this contains no useful parts,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;BLOCKS&quot; INCLUDED</p>

<p>there is several blocks that this set contains that can be easly&nbsp;acquired in other sets</p>

<p>TNT: boom is the only word to describe this...</p>

<p>POPPY: this is the depressing reminder of the rose...</p>

<p>TORCH: well, i have hundreds of these</p>

<p>MOBS:&nbsp;</p>

<p>STEVE: prepare for another Steve, this time holding a stone sword</p>

<p>CREEPER: awe man... JK just your standard creeper, nothing special...</p>

<p>OVERALL REVIEW&nbsp;</p>

<p>well, this set is unfortunatly&nbsp;upsetting... my brother bought this set, and to prove a point, i made this using existing pieces, and although this set is not BAD, it could of had a better potential, we could of had a cheap way to acquire a unique mob/skin, how about not adding Steve and adding a illiger, or how about a llama? we have had WAY too many of them...</p>

<p>in conclusion, i recommend only getting this if you need more creepers or... STEVES...., as this brings nothing unique to the table...</p>

"Nic1306","2020-03-01T10:23:19.42Z","Minecraft in polybag version","<p>General infos about the set:</p>

<p>The set comes with two minfigs, Creeper and Steve. The set has 36 parts and got released in 2019 as first Minecraft polybag.</p>

<p>Minifigs:</p>

<p>The two minifigs coming in this set are Steve and a Creeper. None of the two are exclusive to this set, but its cool to see them in such a tiny set. It a cheap way to get the minifigs. Also the selection is very good. I think it makes sence, to include Steve in the first polybag.</p>

<p>The build:</p>

<p>The build includes nice parts but doesnt look so good. I think partet out, the parts are in better use. But the function with the TNT exploding is cool, and gives this set much and cool playability.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>Good worth for good minifigs and much playability and good parts, definitively worth to buy this one.</p>
