<p>With&nbsp;December 2018 ,&nbsp;came a new sub-theme of the Marvel Superheroes line ; Spider-Man. 5 sets were released as a part of this subtheme&nbsp;; 3 regular sets and 2 Juniors/4+ sets. As&nbsp;well as these sets , a polybag was released containing Spider-Man and a miniature version of&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76114-1/Spider-Man-s-Spider-Crawler"">76114</a>&nbsp;. Given the fact that the set it gains direct inspiration from looks very good , I hope this set will be just as good.</p>

<p><strong>The packaging.</strong></p>

<p>This set is in a regular sized polybag&nbsp;showing Spidey at the controls of his Spider-Crawler crawling around a city. In the top left hand corner is the Lego and Spider-Man logos and below is the set number. In the top right hand corner is an image of Spider-Man in his All New All Different suit&nbsp;known as the&nbsp;<a href=""https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Spider-Armor_MK_IV"">Spider-Armour MK IV</a>&nbsp;. This minifigure is excellent featuring dual molded legs for red boots and intricate torso and head prints.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure.</strong></p>

<p>While the Minifigure in all of the Spider-Man sub-theme sets&nbsp;is exceptionally detailed , the figure found in this set is not that good. The figure included in this set is the same figure used since 2012 and has appeared in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-minifig-sh038"">14 different Spider-Man sets</a>, so if you&rsquo;re a fan of Spidey you are guaranteed to have multiples of it. Nevertheless, this figure features accurate torso and head printing when compared to the source material. This figure was based off Spider-Man&rsquo;s design in the TV show <a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultimate_Spider-Man_(TV_series)"">Ultimate Spider-Man</a>, however also captures the comic look of Spider-Man quite well.&nbsp;This figure features plain blue legs so is slightly disappointing that dual molded legs weren&rsquo;t included. This figure just feels cheapened down , to make this better Lego could have included dual molded legs (<a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sh205/spider-man-black-web-pattern-red-boots"">like this figure</a>) or the new head and torso (<a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sh546/spider-man-dark-red-web-pattern-blue-legs"">like this figure</a>).</p>

<p><strong>The build.</strong></p>

<p>The build in this set is a scaled down version of 76114. Like 76114 , this set has 8 legs with hinges&nbsp;at the knee and at the connection to the body and a red and blue colour scheme. Each leg is identical and features a&nbsp;Plateround 1 x 1 with Throughg. Hole for mechanical detail. The main body of the mechanical spider features two red translucent studs representing lights ,&nbsp;two levers so Spidey can control the Spider and a light bluish grey 2x2 plate that acts as a seat.&nbsp;To the back of the spider there is a clip which connects the bum of the spider to the body.</p>

<p><b>Overall.</b></p>

<p>Overall my opinion on this set is simple ; it&rsquo;s a great build that is rather imaginative but is let down by a fairly poor figure . Due to this reason I would only recommend this set to collectors who want to collect every set in the&nbsp;wave or to children who may not have any Marvel sets as I imagine it would be very good for play.</p>

"vikings","2019-12-30T06:19:32.27Z","Not Bad","<p>This set is mini replica of set 76114: Spider-Man&#39;s Spider Crawler.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a normal polybag with the normal size instructions that come with polybags. The instructions are clear and easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>There are no special parts. The total piece count for this set is 73.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p>Spiderman is the only figure in this set. There is nothing special to this Spiderman. It is just the same old friendly neighborhood Spiderman.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build is quick and easy. Took me a few minutes to build it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:</strong></p>

<p>Once I was finished with it I was pleased with it. For a polybag it is not bad. It resembles the larger version very well. The levers work well for controlling and Spiderman can reach them easily with no problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a decent polybag. The set is a nice replica of the original. The Spiderman is okay just being like every other. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 4 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-23T10:54:44.473Z","Spider-Man Needs Villains.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #30451 Spider-Man&rsquo;s Mini Spider Crawler:</b> Welcome to the first officially released Polybag in the LEGO Spider-Man Sub-Theme of the Marvel Super Heroes brand. Spider-Man has previously had his own Sub-Theme of LEGO Studios then the Spider-Man theme which dealt with Raimi Trilogy 1 &amp; 2, but the competition took over afterwards. And then we come to Marvel Super Heroes where Spider-Man was released alongside his allies in the Marvel Universe.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;m getting a bit long winded though, let&rsquo;s cover the pros and cons of this interesting Polybag idea.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Large, fun and easy to build model for quick and enjoyable play times.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Spider-Man Minifigure included.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Interesting model design with nice colour choices.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Good parts pack.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Lack of accessories for Spider-Man.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">No villain to battle against.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">While this is an interesting Polybag it doesn&rsquo;t really speak to me as something fans of the Theme would want to hunt down and pick up. It makes a nice gift idea for KFOLs, but lacks a lot of play without having other sets from the Theme to accompany it. The Minifigure isn&rsquo;t unique or different from most past releases of Spider-Man and the model is just strange.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It&rsquo;s a bit quirky and pretty impressive too, for a buildable Spider mech vehicle. Polybag collectors will probably get a kick out of it, but in the end I&rsquo;d only mildly recommend the set, and mostly for the parts, it is a pretty decent parts pack after all for clip joints. Mildly recommended.</p>

"Lego_fan_","2020-01-06T03:39:59.537Z","Jointed spider","<p>This Lego set #30451 Spider-Man&#39;s Mini Spider Crawler is a perfect edition to any Marvel, Spider-Man or Super hero collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set contains 75 pieces some of which create Spider-Man.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigure is nothing special, and is the exact same one as many that came before him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Spider crawler build however is very cool looking and great for for display. It has eight legs that can be moved from two differnt points each. Also it&#39;s back can go up and down as well. I think that is is about 4-5 inches across with the Legs like how they are in the photos.</p>

<p>If you ever need some joints parts this set is perfect for them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall i think this set is a must have for any Lego collector or builder.</p>
