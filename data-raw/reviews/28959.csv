<p>When Lego released the stock pictures of this model, I was absolutely struck by the level of accuracy the designers put in to this ginormous set. I was very pleased to see that one could customize the model to either a street or super-loaded Ford Mustang. This is typical of Creator line to have more than one version of a set, which I found interesting for this line of sets. The set is very large and dense throughout. At no point of the build did I feel bored. All techniques used for the vehicle were very characteristic of the designer, Mike Psaki. I have always wanted a Creator Expert vehicle, but this vehicle had many more functions that previous models really never had.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What I enjoyed about the model:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>Typically for Creator Expert vehicles, they do not exhibit any functions for the set itself. The only other one that had done this was the Aston Martin DB5, which had such functions as an ejector seat and bullet-proof shield. However, the Ford Mustang presented the first system of a steering system in this series of vehicles. Though it was a very basic system, compared to Technic models, I really was amazed that Mike wanted to have a steering mechanism in this highly detailed vehicle. In addition, they included a hydraulic system in the back of the vehicle to raise and lower the rear axis. I had never seen this system in even Technic models, which presented a breakthrough in the melding of both themes in the Lego universe. It intrigued me that the function did not stop when the knob underneath the car was spun, making the loop go on infinitely and in both directions. Very excited to see these two functions become introduced into this theme.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>It was very interesting to have many more printed pieces in this model. Creator Expert has very limited amount of stickers for their cars, usually leaving them for the license plate and making the entire model bland throughout. The stripes of the Mustang are iconic and I was happy to see the large amount of printed tiles during the building process.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What I disliked about the model:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The only one negative of the model was the ability to switch between a base production model and street racer version. I understand that it allows the builder to display the model that they enjoy the most, but it also makes a lot of excess pieces after the version is made. It feels not as complete as any other model looks. I would have liked to incorporate all the pieces into the vehicle at one time, which is impossible (I tried and it did not work). Some of the pieces could have been used for a Ford memorial or plaque describing the car.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Would I recommend this set?</strong></h2>

<p>Given that this is my first Creator Expert vehicle and the amount of praise all the major Lego reviewers have for this amazing model, I would highly recommend this model. Lego went above and beyond to hype up this model and promote their partnership with Ford. They have designed a smaller one for Speed Champions but made minor details shine in this enormous set. The instruction booklet is full of various facts throughout the process and a brief history of Ford, making this set that much more special for the builder. It felt very easy to build and enjoyed the new approach of incorporating more unique functions to future vehicles of this line. I hope to start collecting future models from this iconic theme!</p>

"Marlon8000","2019-04-06T18:18:38.42Z","Buckle up buckaroos","<p>If I could say what the next Creator Expert set should be... This would be it !!!!&nbsp; Finally a &#39;67 Mustang GT. So it didn&#39;t take long before the mailman had a package for me.</p>

<p>Here we go!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The box:</strong></p>

<p>On the front of the box, there is the LEGO Mustang seen on the left front corner.The background is a dried up canal -Looks like the canal where the race in Grease took place-&nbsp;Te usual information on the left: Age rating 16+, Set number 10265 and name, and a little lower, 1471 pieces. In the bottom right corner shows the Pony logo. on the right there is also the Expert banner that shows a detail pic of the engine, and the dimensions of the car.</p>

<p>The back shows the Mustang completely tuned: Front and back spoilers, air intake on top of the hood, exhausts on the side and the backside is raised. In this set you can choose to pimp your Mustang or not, all parts are included.</p>

<p>In the box, there are 11 bags. 6 big bags numbered 1 to 6. and 5 bags numbered 1 to 6 where 5 was left out.</p>

<p>The instruction booklet is sealed in with the sticker sheet</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The instructions:</strong></p>

<p>The instructions are very clear......................&nbsp;booklet has 211 pages and 313 steps and starts with some Mustang history on the first 11 pages, which is quite interesting.</p>

<p>At the end there is some advertisement for other LEGO sets, and, as usual,&nbsp;the last 2 pages are the partslist of this set</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The build</strong></p>

<p><strong>Bags 1:</strong></p>

<p>These kind of Creator sets usually start out the same, but pretty quick something unique happens... This is, as far as I know, the first Creator car of this size with steering wheels. For the steering, a 40T gear is used, which is quite big.</p>

<p>Bags number 1 builds the chassis with front axle and its steering mechanism, and on the back the mechanism for raising and lowering the back axle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bags 2:</strong></p>

<p>The back axle is being build, and once mounted, it can be raised and lowered by a round 2x2&nbsp;turning knob. the knob sticks out from underneath the chassis... pretty cool.</p>

<p>Also the front end, and the first part of the engine is build. The valve covers have the Powered by Ford stickers, and the oil cap has a printed Pony logo. Also, the way the engine hoses are made is pretty clever, but one hose is running over the oil cap. I pushed that one hose down underneath the tilted part.</p>

<p>After the steering column and the center console, bags 2 are empty. The sloped part next to the steering column was a bit tricky. Instructions were a bit unclear on how it was supposed to go.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bags 3:</strong></p>

<p>With bags 3, you&#39;ll build the doors and the front seats... The doors are longer than I expected... 12 studs. But build pretty sturdy and hung up on a double hinge construction. Opening and closing goes with a healthy resistance. The striping on the doors are printed sloped 2x2&nbsp;tiles, and in front of each door a 4x2 sloped tile with the GT logo.</p>

<p>The seats are pretty straight forward, but look good because of the Palisade 1x2 brick in Sand Yellow. The seats are mounted onto the chassis by a rod on the bottom, and Plate 1x1 W.holders on the front of the seats. This way they tilt forwards... Nice!</p>

<p>For the rest it is some construction on the back end. The lower side body&nbsp;behind the rear wheels and the 2 dual exhausts are the only visible things.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bags 4:</strong></p>

<p>Bags 4&nbsp;holds the parts to build the back end of the Mustang. The entire backside is build&nbsp;as SNOT. After building the backseats, the&nbsp;rear window is placed on its back and from that point on, you build towards the taillights. The back end has the round GT logo, which is a sticker. The taillights are 2 studs tall, looks a bit too tall in relation to the size of the car, but I guess if the height was only 1 stud, they would be too small...</p>

<p>All in all, the tail looks awesome. Only thing missing at this point is the trunk lid. &nbsp;I particularly like the way the rear window is placed over the rear seats</p>

<p>With bags 4 I really got excited about what a great set this is...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bags 5:</strong></p>

<p>Now it is time to build the front end of the car. Well, it starts with the top of the doors, which adds an extra hinge element. This makes the doors very sturdy despite their length.</p>

<p>Then the engine is completed with a double fan belt construction, the radiator and finally the carburetor with air filter... Beautiful!</p>

<p>The front bumper is in 3 parts so that it has the 2 folds in it. The grill has a printed tile with the&nbsp;Pony logo, and fog lights on Plate 1x1 Round w/ horizontal 3.2 shaft, which touches the&nbsp;printed tile perfectly. The sunken headlights look great&nbsp;with the standing 2x2 27 deg plates... Very genuine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Bags 6:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>With bags 6 the car will be finished, starting with the rooftop, the trunk lid, and the hood.</p>

<p>Basically the 3 panels are build the same way. Lot of 2x3 and 2x4 tiles in White and Earth Blue. The center line are printed tiles.</p>

<p>The hood is a bit disappointing. It is just a straight panel that never fully closes. There is always a minimal gap with the grill... Also the hood&nbsp;has an air intake that only mounts on 2 studs, so it easily comes off. Ofcourse, this is done because of the engine upgrade that can be done, but it can also fall out when you don&#39;t want it to.</p>

<p>Adding of the wheels with unique rims, and the license plates, and this &#39;67 Mustang GT is done.</p>

<p>You can choose between 5 types of license plates; 2 American types, 1 British, 1 German, and 1 I&#39;, not sure of... French or Polish... There are extra tiles for all license plate stickers.</p>

<p>Now, the car is done, but not really... some upgrades can be done to make this already awesome car into a road monster.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Upgrades:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Engine:</strong></p>

<p>Once you finished the build of the turbo/air intake, you need to take out the air intake of the hood, and the air filter (The blue round thingy on top of the engine). Then you place the turbo/air intake on top of the engine through the opening in the hood.</p>

<p>The hood still opens all the way without touching the air intake.</p>

<p>It looks pretty cool, but for me personally, it is a bit over the top.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Exhausts:</strong></p>

<p>The new exhaust will be located right behind the front wheels. Once the minibuilds of the quadruple exhausts are done, they click on very easy. You might need to line them out so that they point backwards a little.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t forget to take off the exhausts on the back end.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Front spoiler:</strong></p>

<p>The front spoiler is build with about 10 bricks, and clicks underneath the front of the car. Personally I think it is 2 studs too short... you can see the tires when looked at it head on.</p>

<p>Also, it doesn&#39;t look so cool from the sides... It seems that the design of this spoiler was done in a rush.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rear spoiler:</strong></p>

<p>The rear spoiler doesn&#39;t look too bad, however, when looked at from the rear you see the 2x2 round slide shoes that are used to make the spoiler sturdy...</p>

<p>The 2 spoilers are entirely in Earth Blue colour, while they should also have the with striping that runs over the length of the car.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>NOS tank:</strong></p>

<p>The NOS tank is actually pretty cool... it goes in the trunk so you it placed out of sight, but I like it.</p>

<p>A little 2x2 cylinder with rounded top. On top a nozzle with a gauge... I think I&#39;ll keep that.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The completed model:</strong></p>

<p>Well,... Up till now, my favorite Creator set was the Ferrari F40, but&nbsp;I think this is one of the best creator set so far, The shape of the car is very genuine.... Arg! difficult,.. ok, a tie between the Mustang and the F40... But yes, great build, higher playability because of the steering wheels, and the upgrade options. Cool parts like the rims, and many parts in Earth Blue... Very good value for your money.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t care much for the upgrades, so I will bring it back to original state, but yes, this was a very enjoyable build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Should I go get this set?</strong></p>

<p>Owwwyessssss!!!!!!!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Thank you for reading, have fun :-)</strong></p>

"matrix_7000","2020-03-19T19:10:14.593Z","One of my favourites","<p>This model is definitively one the best made by Lego. It really looks like the real car and it has many details and a great &quot;Muscle car&quot; kit.</p>

<p>Many people are complaining about the lines that are not aligned perfectly, but this is for me a detail.</p>

<p>This is my favourite with the &quot;Harley Davidson Fat Boy&quot;.</p>

<p>It is a very good value for money.</p>

"mablemyhre","2020-01-09T19:34:58.633Z","Great Lego Mustang","<p>This is a great set for you Mustang lovers. The build is a lot of fun.&nbsp; The front wheels turn with the steering wheel.&nbsp; You can build it so the engine is exposed through the hood.&nbsp; A few stickers but nothing too complicated.&nbsp; This is certainly priced right given the number&nbsp; of pieces. The engine is very detailed. I would highly recommend. I think it is the best car Lego offers.</p>

"StanSUeScotty","2020-04-03T09:54:18.7Z","Nice Looking!","<p>It looks fantastic! The design, colors, and details are the best of all lego cars, surpassing all vehicles from the technics theme.</p>

<p>The only drawback of this car is that it does not have&nbsp;cylinders, making it only a model but not a real car.</p>

<p>It&#39;s really fun to play since there are 2 different modes and multiple license plates choices, and you can easily lift up the rear chassis thru spinning a hidden gear.</p>

"Sfish57","2020-10-19T01:37:04.323Z","Cool and good looking model","<p>A real&nbsp;well sized and good looking model set. The colors are awesome and the proportions are spot on. Most of the build was different and interesting along the way. Some repetition but not much. Some nice details, especially that add ons to make it a hot rod or daily driver. Good value. If you like cars and models this will be a fun and pretty project.&nbsp;</p>

"mrbrick81","2020-08-15T22:14:06.22Z","Great building experience of iconic muscle car","<p>A perfect combination of easy to follow instructions, Technic parts under the bonnet and System parts to make the rest as well as a sleek finish with tiles to avoid to many studs.</p>

<p>Close to perfection in design, if you take the piece count into account and the limitations of System the design team had to overcome while keeping the price tag&nbsp;reasonable.</p>

<p>Choice of colour for this iconic muscle car is right on the mark and the set even comes with a couple of upgrade pieces to even further the look of raw engine power and gorgeous model outlines.</p>

<p>Only cons you can think of are a couple of fragile pieces like the rear-view mirrors, the stiff steering (no HOG) and there not being a suspension. Bear in mind though that the Technic pieces are kept to a minimum (around 15%).&nbsp;To conclude, the set also does not include any mini figs, so if that is your thing, you won&#39;t find it here.</p>

<p>Best and most complete car in the Creator Expert car series so far. Hope they do similar iconic cars in the future with this amount of detail or make one in the 1:8 super car series; a more modern Mustang edition or the Transformers Camaro? who knows.</p>

<p>Until then, this is your safest bet if you are out for a pristine model of a classic muscle car and an enjoyable building experience.</p>

"Karidian","2021-04-25T01:50:39.567Z","My First Ever Build","<p>As a late comer to LEGO, (at 66) this was my first ever build and experience with LEGO.&nbsp; I had been intrigued by the Land Rover after seeing it in a toy dept at a store we regularly shop.&nbsp; Also was something my husband wanted to try, so he bought the Ducati bike and I ended up with the Mustang since the Land Rover was sold out.&nbsp;&nbsp; My first car was a &#39;67 Mustang GT so this had personal memories for me also.&nbsp;&nbsp; The build was intimidating until I got into the swing of things and got better at finding the parts. It was amazing to see the car coming to life from all the parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; Learned so much about how the parts worked together, I felt the design was incredible for all the attention to detail and fit. &nbsp; I took my time, had to rework a few things due to errors on my part, but the end result was fantastic.&nbsp; I really enjoyed working on this build and have also bought and built the Fiat 500 and the Chevrolet Corvette. &nbsp; Both my husband and I are hooked. &nbsp; We have purchased the Land Rover among several other large kits. &nbsp;&nbsp; I would recommend this build for an adult beginner or experienced LEGO fan.&nbsp;&nbsp; Great value and satisfaction for the money.</p>
