My daughter saw it in the LEGO magazine and wanted it because it had a girl and a dolphin in the set.  The figures in the Belville group are larger than most(3&quot; tall), they are jointed at the ankles, knees and elbows. I'm glad I have at least one of the Belville sets, however since my daughter is older now, this will most likely be the only one in our collection. Great simple set for a young girl, and it was $4.99 retail at the time of purchase.   Solid 3 for what it is.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
