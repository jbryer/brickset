<p>The new Sky Police theme on first view seems a nice addition to the City line, however this is certainly a set to avoid unless you strive to get all the sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;It comes &quot;free&quot; with issue 11 of the Lego City Comic with a price tag of &pound;4.25 for this month, and is available between 9th January 2019 and 12th February 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Packet</strong></p>

<p>Issue 11 is the first of the City Comics&nbsp;to have the wider foil bag that is sealed rather than&nbsp;having a glued flap.&nbsp; These are harder to&nbsp;open than the previous versions, but at least you don&#39;t get the smaller parts stuck&nbsp;on the glue.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>This month we are introduced to Tom Maverick.&nbsp; He&nbsp;has the same torso and legs as the 2017 set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60138-1/High-speed-Chase"">60138</a>&nbsp;which is better know as Chase McCain.&nbsp; The head has been used many times before to depict pilots and the helmet is simply white with a transparent brown visor, again used multiple times previously.</p>

<p><strong>Main Build/Parts</strong></p>

<p>The build is complete within nine steps and is constructed out of 27 pieces.&nbsp; There is little I can say that I like about this unfortunately.&nbsp; The pilot sits as low as possible, but still appears to be too high.&nbsp; It is solid enough for play and the use of the tile element <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6131655"">6131655</a> does round off the front of each wing nicely, but it is not enough in my view to save the set.&nbsp; The tile element is relatively rare as it only appears in 9 sets according to the database (10 including this one).</p>

<p>This is a strange City Police set as it does not contain any handcuffs?&nbsp; I expect most people have plenty and with no crook to catch they are not needed.&nbsp; A basic crook Minifigure may have saved this set as the play value is very limited unless you have other sets, although that would have probably pushed it through the price bracket.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>The build made me think that they had a few pieces left over and put them together in the dark to see what they could make.&nbsp; The comic sets had been pretty strong up to now, so this is a surprise.&nbsp; Looking at what is coming next month I think we will be waiting a while for another great set.&nbsp; Next month is two Firemen, but it does include the new axe!</p>

<p>The price has reduced from the issue 10, but is still up on the month before that.&nbsp; The price does fluctuate depending on what is attached and this month&#39;s &pound;4.25 is not too bad.</p>

<p>If you miss out on this now I expect it will be attached to one of the future comics as Lego try to get rid of the ones they are bound to have left from 13th February.</p>

<p>I would recommend getting Issue 2 of the Giant Series, also released on 9th January 2019, as that comes with <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30359-1/Police-Water-Plane"">30359</a>.&nbsp; The Giant Series is only &pound;0.60 more and the Polybag is far superior.&nbsp; Additionally if you are getting this for a younger Lego fan, then <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60206-1/Jet-Patrol"">60206</a> could be a better choice at &pound;7.99.</p>
