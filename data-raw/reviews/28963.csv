<p>Packaging / Instructions<br />
The minifigure is packed in a foil&nbsp;bag with glue stronger than before. In the magazine, surprisingly, there was an instruction! It wasn&#39;t needed, but it is.</p>

<p>Minifigures<br />
For that matter, the Young Wu minifigure is the highlight of the set. He&nbsp;has Cole&#39;s hair from Ninjago Movie repainted, an exclusive head and torso to this character, and plain, unprinted black legs.</p>

<p>Parts<br />
Nothing interesting. We get 2 golden lightsaber handles, a brown 3L stick and 2 small white fangs.</p>

<p>Generally<br />
It is a great set, mainly because of the minifigure&nbsp;and the low price.</p>
