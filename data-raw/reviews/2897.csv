"Belville_Lover","2010-06-07T02:25:08.137Z","Real beach day","I once got this set for my birthday and I was a fan of Belville and dolphins.<br>It is really good to experience a beach day, because there ware a lot of specials (shell, crab, sea star). The girl has a basket, which is good to carry things to the beach, a nice datail.<br>This set is really good to combine with others: you need people, who watch a dolphin show or join the beach scene.<br>&nbsp;On the other hand, if you don't want to train dolphins, since you respect the animals and don't want to use them for show business, you can play life guard with this set: you have a tower, life wests and a scooter- and like in ancient Greece: dolphins, who save peoples lives ;).<br>Another feature of this set is the new look of the girl: she has a new hairstyle and the mimic is different compared to older sets.<br>",TRUE,3,4,2,4,3

<p>I loved the Belville line. The dolls offer great playability because of their joints: they can move, bend, sit, hold stuff. You could swap their hands, legs, head, etc. and create unique dolls.</p>

<p>This set offers little building experience like most of the Belvilles. The emphasis is on the dolls and the stories kids could create with it. Of course, you need more than one doll to create a story. The set comes with plenty of accessories for playtime: dolphins, crab, water star, basket, blanket, skirt, life vest, hula-hoop. My favourite accessory is the jet ski! The tree and springboard (sorry I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s called exactly) adds a nice touch to scenery, it helps recreate the atmosphere of the beach.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s one of the best Belville sets (though I don&#39;t own much, but I searched the database before this review). I don&#39;t like the fairytale line of Belville, but I think the sets that imitates life-like scenes are absolutely lovely and offer great amount of playtime for kids. This is where not the build that matters but the stories kids could create with the dolls and accessories. At least me and my childhood friend played countless hours with Belville figures.</p>
