It opens and closes quite nicely, and the parts lie inside ready to be played with. There is even a 3D picture on the front which either displays The Lego Movie 2 logo, or a smiling&nbsp;Emmet.</p>

<p>When you open this up, the crane is stored in three pieces which can be easily placed together for play. When you are done, you clip the chunks back to their places, and close it up. The downside of this set is that one of the pieces does not clip and stay as advertised. So, when you close the pod, the piece just tumbles loosely in the container.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Normally costing ten US dollars, however, I wouldn&#39;t pick this up unless I found it on sale.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a really nice set to have on the go, I&#39;m just disappointed that the piece doesn&#39;t stay in place.</p>

So when LEGO marked down The LEGO Movie 2 Pods during Black Friday I decided to toss them in. Rather than discuss them fully I will treat them as I did with the Polybag Pods I&rsquo;ve reviewed before, despite the change in packaging, there really isn&rsquo;t enough to warrant one of my fuller reviews. Now then, onto the Pros and Cons.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Emmet packaged in a little Pod to build and play with.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Pod design fairly fun, interior builds are great and printed display elements exist for a decent display option. Also includes simple 3D image effect on the front of the package.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Packaging design is vastly improved, allowing for easy opening and quick building fun.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Emmet Minifigure not unique to this set.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Price Range seems high for what you get. Despite what Brickset says I&rsquo;m fairly certain these were originally 8$ a piece in Canada. Which seems a tad high for what is essentially a Polybag item.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Easy to lose when brought into the park or somewhere to play with.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I like the idea of Pods, a fun little model to build and collect, a great toy for carry and build play which is convenient for taking to school or friends&rsquo; places with your favorite characters. What I don&rsquo;t like is that you can&rsquo;t connect these to Baseplates for a display option. And it looks like they intend to rectify this with the new pods being introduced this year, though I&rsquo;ll have to wait and see when I can pick one up to build with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Would I recommend this set? Not at full retail price. If you want to collect all of the pods, because they all do have unique prints inside and out and look very collectible, I&rsquo;d suggest picking them up when you can find them on sale or for a good BOGO style price. Should such a thing happen. Otherwise it is extremely safe to skip out on these purchases. Mildly Recommended.</p>
