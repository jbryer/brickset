But I will say while I was a bit meh in the previous review, this time I&rsquo;m going to surprise you I&rsquo;m certain.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Great pod design and excellent parts as well as a fun print.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Awesome 3D image on the front of the pod.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Sweet Mayhem Mini-Doll re-uses parts, but is unique to this set unlike Emmet.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Price rather high for product.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Easy to lose or misplace when taken to the park or a friends&rsquo; house to play with.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I felt that the Emmet Pod could be skipped because it didn&rsquo;t offer much in the way of exciting options. The Minifigure wasn&rsquo;t even unique, as it could have been Vest-Friend Emmet or something, but was just the same old Emmet. Here Sweet Mayhem looks more interesting, she is unique to this set and includes some parts such as the small heart-shaped tile which is a great part to get. Overall I feel that this Pod is just a better package, another thing I didn&rsquo;t mention in the Emmet review is that his parts are a bit looser, his construction arm won&rsquo;t store securely so it moves around a lot and could be lost much easier than anything with Sweet Mayhem&rsquo;s pod.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Comparing the two I feel Sweet Mayhem is a much better offering, the build is more cohesive and I love the look of it. Overall I&rsquo;d recommend this set much more than Emmet&rsquo;s. Highly Recommended.</p>
