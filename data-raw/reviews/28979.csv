No little builders to take advantage of the sets in my household, though I still have plans to get a few Duplo sets based on certain Themes I am enamored with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is therefore a rare review item from me. A Duplo Polybag, I tossed it in with a larger order to qualify for free shipping and because I was genuinely curious to see which one of the five I&rsquo;d get.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Duplo is designed for smaller builders. Between the ages of 1-4. It is designed to work with LEGO elements as well, so some clever builders, such as Jangbricks, use Duplo to make the interior of much larger models to save on parts. It&rsquo;s a very interesting idea, and one might even dare to use the term ingenious. Be that as it may I haven&rsquo;t seen a Duplo set in years. Not since I was of that young age and even then I can&rsquo;t be certain it was official.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Anyway. The Town Rescue Polybag is a mystery offering. If you find them on store shelves you can easily identify which ones are which and buy whichever ones you want for your little builder. All five variants have the exact same elements save for the person or animal included in the bag, you get a 2x4 Duplo Plate, a large red fire hydrant and a splash of water. You can choose to get a Fireman, a Policewoman, a Dog, a Cat or a Bird. When ordering from Wal-Mart online you have no idea which of the five you&rsquo;ll get so it&rsquo;s a fun little mystery when shopping online.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The parts offer limited play value, but with imagination and fun you and your little one can pretend any number of scenarios as you teach them to play with Duplo in great little creative ways. Mix and match with existing sets to expand your options, buy multiples and stack the plates up to make a fun little fire dousing tower. There is an endless array of imaginative play you can enjoy alongside your builder when you get this Polybag.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;d recommend this item as part of a larger purchase of Duplo sets to offer more excitement and fun. Introducing the little builders to the fun world of Polybags in this fashion is a great idea. I really feel that you&rsquo;d get more value if you tried to find and pick out the ones with actual people to play with instead though, but the bird is still a nice solid element and large enough to avoid any problems with children sticking it in their mouths. (Not that I&rsquo;d recommend letting them do that regardless.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Recommended. Oh, and if you enjoy collecting Polybags, but don&rsquo;t have any children to get this for aside from yourself. Well, good luck getting all five variants if you only have access to online options. This is one of those collectibles made to drive collectors mad with the &lsquo;Mystery&rsquo; aspect of it all. Fortunately for myself I&rsquo;m content with having just the one out of the five for my collection. Your mileage may vary on that one folks.</p>
