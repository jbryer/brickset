"Gridlock007","2019-04-29T19:34:00.2Z","second best Far From Home set","<p>The Lego Marvel Superheroes&nbsp;Molten Man Battle is an Exceptional Set. $29.99 is a good price, as it features 297 pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Packaging:</p>

<p>While not as good as Endgames boxes, I think the packaging is very decent. The instructions had an ad for the other two sets, along with the usual Lego Life ad.</p>

<p>Comparison to other sets:</p>

<p>The subtheme has two other sets. I think it is not as good as the Hydro Man Attack, but better then Stark Plane and Drone Attack. I am happy this is not a mech, as mechs are overdone. Furthermore, this reminds me of the monsters from power miners.</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>Spider-Man: This is a new variant of Spider-Man, as he is in his stealth suit. It looks useful for a custom Spider-Man Noir.</p>

<p>Mysterio: While a good figure, he does appear in each set.</p>

<p>Firefighter: He is the chosen one to destroy Molten Man with his one fire extinguisher.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>I think this is&nbsp;a good quality set. If you want a Far from home set, get the Hydro man set, but this is more for children and play.</p>

"azgx29","2019-12-19T18:53:26.523Z","My review","<p>The set is pretty great overall. Could have been slightly lower price. One complaint is with the instructions it is hard to tell whether those orange bricks are with print or without it. I constantly had to search up images of the set to make sure I did it right. Other than that great set.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-23T11:19:44.4Z","Monstrous Molten Marvel!","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #76128 Molten Man Battle:</b> Welcome to the Spider-Man Far From Home LEGO Built Character Pack. It&rsquo;s expensive, features no set pieces for display options and includes unique Minifigures for the Super Heroes line. It&rsquo;s also the cheapest option from the Far From Home sub-line or at least it was until the Minifigure Set was released. That being said this being the cheapest set to get Mysterio is rather unfortunate as there isn&rsquo;t enough to justify purchasing it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The set uses a vertical designed box with the image on the front being height wise instead of length wise. It is an interesting action shot showing off the set in all its glory, Spidey&rsquo;s live action head on the side of the front of the image is replicated on the side panel in brick form with the mini-figure. It&rsquo;s a decent enough box, but it might have been nicer to see some more fire elements used with bricks rather than the artwork of fire around the LEGO set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Far From Home package design carries over to the manual design. In the back the LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2 Game is advertised. And the LEGO Life QR code is on the front.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is just front loaded with parts, ball joints and ball joint sockets, a large tire, massive stud launcher, orange bumpy lava-like elements with gold detailing and a printed Molten Man facial part. Also all of the new Web gear Spidey uses. Highly impressive selection of parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Firefighter: A regular citizen is a rare figure to see in the Super Heroes theme. This Firefighter has a highly detailed uniform print with a portable flashlight attached to his torso and some leg printing for the high visibility parts of the uniform. I&rsquo;m not sure if this is shared with LEGO City as far as prints go, but the parts are similar. He has a dark red hat, a dark reddish brown head and a fire extinguisher using the flintlock pistol and some parts to make one which is kind of neat.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Mysterio: This Minifigure is 100% identical to the one found in the previous set I reviewed, the printing and accessories are all the same. He is a solid Minifigure though and it&rsquo;s nice to see him included in so many sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Spider-Man: This version of the character is also known as Hit Monkey by the citizens of Paris. He&rsquo;s got a highly detailed body armor printed on his torso and legs and a balaclava style mask with night-vision goggles. His accessories include web effects for different attack options, a clip-on web swinging piece and web cuffs. Overall a nice variant for collectors who enjoy such things.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 1: Spider-Man and Firefighter must contend with the formation of Molten Man&rsquo;s torso. This part of the build is fairly straight forward, build the legs, build the torso, connect them all together. The only parts you may need to pay close attention to is the numerous orange rocky parts used for magma, some of these have printed gold detailing and some are clear, sometimes these can be confused for one another during the build so always check carefully before using a part.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 2: Mysterio aids in completing Molten Man with his arms and head, again this part of the build was relatively easy. There is a few stickers to be applied of course, and again the same orange rocky parts mentioned above need to be carefully checked over before attaching to avoid disassembling to put the proper part in place later. Speaking from experience there. Overall though, not too troublesome of a build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Molten Man: As with most brick-built massive figs or however you&rsquo;d care to term the, you will find some pros and cons. The joints with the bricks tends to limit stances for dynamic posing, indeed it seems like some of the weight weakens the joints with time as one of my feet tends to flop around more than I&rsquo;m used to with this style of buildable character. Molten Man has a lot of interesting design cues though, you&rsquo;ll find part of a street light and street sign on his arm, part of a car melted into his torso, a traffic light, a stud launcher and dripping orange magma as well as orange chains.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This model is a bit squat, but looks great, and despite what happens in the actual movie I can actually believe that this is actually a dangerous villain about to melt and burn the streets of Paris. If it weren&rsquo;t for the loose ankle joints making posing difficult I&rsquo;d say the model was almost perfect.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Really impressed with this set. I&rsquo;d strongly recommend it to complete the Far From Home sub-theme of MCU sets. I feel though that LEGO may need to firm up the molds for the ball joints to prevent them from deteriorating, Spidey&rsquo;s villain shouldn&rsquo;t topple face forward just by looking at him. Strongly Recommended.</p>

"Isj_rocks","2023-04-28T19:31:21.907Z","A set that was great before the movie..","<p><b>Introduction: </b>I&nbsp;knew from the first pictures that I would own this set, Molten Man looked creepy, but cool, and the Stealth Suit Spider-Man looked amazing even in those blurry images. A lot of my assumptions about the set were correct, but how does it measure up after seeing the film?</p>

<p><b>Minifigures: </b>Let&rsquo;s begin with the figures in the set. Starting with the&nbsp;blandest in my opinion, the firefighter. I do like the figure, I just lack the understanding of why he was chosen over notable characters in the film such as Ned, Betty, or even a Nick Fury variant. The torso and legs have great printing and the fire extinguisher is a nice inclusion. Next, the Mysterio figure looks great as it does in the three sets this wave. The minifig includes blue power blasts instead of more accurate purple ones, this is understandable because to my knowledge the piece doesn&rsquo;t come in purple.&nbsp;His inclusion was accurate to the film and really rounds out the minifigures. Lastly, the stealth suit, or as it&rsquo;s called in the movie, the Night Monkey suit.&nbsp;I really like the head and appreciate the small details on it, the head can also be handy in Spider-Man purist customs. The torso print is very nice and includes a&nbsp;S.H.I.E.L.D. logo in the corner. The legs are also very detailed. The figure also comes with a plethora of web pieces.</p>

<p><b>Build: </b>The Molten Man build is the main one of the set, and looks like a walking street. The street builds include construction poles, stop lights, street lamps, signs, and the front of a car. These builds can be easily removed from the Molten Man build if you wanted to add them to a lego city or such. One hand of the creature is a stud shooter and the other is a usual hand. The stud shooter really fits into the build and adds a lot of nice playability. The other hand can easily grab around the figures. The build includes plenty of translucent orange pieces that could be incredibly useful in a volcano MOC, but in the actual build here they all look quite nice. The build also includes plenty of places for Spider-Mans web pieces to hook on to.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion: </b>Overall, the build and minifigures provide lots of fun, except for the fact of the shocking twist in Spider-Man Far From Home that nullifies the purpose of Molten Man as a villain in the film. With that aside, I&rsquo;m really happy to own the set, I like the Night Monkey figure a lot and the Mysterio figure is always great on it&#39;s own or for parts. I hope you enjoyed this review of set 76128!</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2020-04-09T14:53:46.177Z","FIREMAN-SAVIOR OF EUROPE","<p>I loved Spider Man Far From Home and the wave of sets Lego put out for the movie was pretty interesting, this one in particular caught my eye since this and the Hydro Man Attack set looked like pretty unique sets especially for a theme with overdone and oversized 20 dollar bike sets. And all the figures were great (almost)!&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&#39;t worry we&#39;ll get the&nbsp;fireman out the way in a minute, Let&#39;s start off with Molten Man.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p><strong>The Molten Man:</strong>&nbsp;He is the main and only build of the set, and the way he was built up was pretty interesting... &nbsp;His design feels like it came out fresh from the ground, which was a fun and unique concept that was executed very well. All sorts of metal parts are found around the model, like traffic lights with a sticker that says &quot;Krater Rd&quot; connected at the right shoulder area, a road sign (using a sticker)with a cross on a vehicle that looks scratched up on the left shoulder area, a lamppost, a car hood coming out of the torso, and 2 bar designs with an identical build and stickers, one connected at the back and another on the right hand, both using mini ball joint connections. The legs use 2 points of articulation using ball joints, they work pretty well here and give the figure a lot of different poses or even stand him up on 1 foot if you want to. The torso&nbsp;looks pretty complete with a lot of great texture to give a rocky feel to it, sticker molten lava designs&nbsp;and&nbsp;a lot of rock pieces in translucent orange&nbsp;(and even some with a gold shine to it which is awesome)are pretty much present throughout the whole&nbsp;build. It&nbsp;also uses&nbsp;3 translucent orange long antenna pieces to represent some dripping lava and 2 long translucent orange&nbsp;chains, which isn&#39;t a new coloring, but very nice to get.&nbsp;The face of the monster is attached with mini balls joints and has 2 points of articulation so that you could move it around, the&nbsp;face came out really good&nbsp;&nbsp;using a printed shoulder pad piece. The back is also complete with no anti studs exposed, which is always a plus. Finally, we got the hands, the right one is a rapid fire 6 stud shooter and the left one is a regular hand where you could move fingers and grab figures.</p>

<h3>The Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Stealth Suit Spiderman:</strong> This variant of Spider-Man&nbsp;is AWESOME, he&#39;s one of my favorite Marvel minifigures in a while. The whole suit design is very interesting for a character like Spiderman, it&#39;s very detailed with printing all over the back and legs (with even hip and feet printing). The mask design was also very awesome with printing on the back of the head as well, it&#39;s a fresh and awesome twist on spidey and he&#39;s easily the standout of the set.<br />
<br />
<strong>Mysterio:</strong>&nbsp;Mysterio makes an appearance&nbsp;here, just like in the other 2 sets of the wave, while he&#39;s not exclusive, it&#39;s nice to get him here. He&#39;s&nbsp;got good green and gold armor printing on the torso and legs and are pretty much on the same level of good detailing as the Spiderman in this set. He&#39;s got his pink newer style cape and a plain silver head piece under the new fishbowl piece that has an accessory hole (if you have the Scrooge McDuck minifigure, you could put his top hat piece on it, which looks very cool), overall a really neat figure.<br />
<br />
<strong>Fireman:</strong> And then we get the EPIC figure of the set that is the Fireman, definitely one of Marvel&#39;s greatest superheroes of all ti- &nbsp;ok I can&#39;t keep this up any longer. Believe me, I&#39;ve seen all the memes of this guy in Just2Good&#39;s sub-reddit. And&nbsp;since he&#39;s a meme he has some ironic value to me, but he&#39;s still a stupid inclusion in the set. It just boggles my mind that in a theme where Lego seldom gives their figures leg printing, SOMEHOW give it to this guy of all characters, just...why? The torso and leg prints are just reused from Lego City, he even uses a very common face print, the only thing I could say is good about him is the interesting part usage of a flintlock piece for a fire extinguisher, other than that, terrible figure, he has no reason to show up here over one of Peter&#39;s classmates that could&#39;ve been fun.</p>

<h3>Value for Money</h3>

<p>I&#39;d say the value of the set is pretty decent, the price seems about right for what&#39;s included here, you get a great action figure-like Molten Man that&#39;s reasonably sized and 2 great figures for a play scene, maybe it could&#39;ve been slightly lower price, but still fine.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion</h3>

<p>Again, with a theme that&#39;s running out of ideas and&nbsp;just comes out with overdone vehicles, it&#39;s a breath of fresh air for a set like this to come out from the theme. The Molten Man is a great build that&#39;s good for both play and display, and the figures are amazing (except for Fireman obviously). But unfortunately, the Fireman just weighs&nbsp;this set down quite a lot, it&#39;s a waste of a minifigure spot that was made with pure laziness, I would&#39;ve given this set a 5 star if a more interesting figure took his place. But overall I can&#39;t be too hard on the set and it&#39;s still mostly a really good set since the other 2 figures are amazing and the originality of the set is truly welcome, and for 30 bucks, it&#39;s a decent&nbsp;value and I still recommend it, even if you&#39;re not a spidey fan.</p>
