<p>Fortunately, this year ushered in the new wave of three sets for Spider-Man: Far From Home, and this one in particular is by far my favorite&nbsp;- not just of this wave, but of this whole year so far.</p>

<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>This set took a decent amount of time to build, and since it&#39;s a playset, I had a lot of fun putting together the different structures and admiring the building techniques and designs.&nbsp; Overall, it was a pretty pleasant experience, and one that I don&#39;t feel very often these days with how few&nbsp;playsets come out every year.</p>

<h2>The Minifigs</h2>

<p>This set includes four minfigures - three of which are exclusive.</p>

<p>The first minifigure is our very first MCU Peter Parker minifigure, and the first general figure of the character since the old Sam Raimi film sets.&nbsp; He has two interchangeable headpieces - first is his hairpiece which is the Captain America/Star Lord/Tony Stark/whoever else hairpiece in dark brown, which is a color that was also used for Steve Trevor in that one DCEU Wonder Woman set a few years back.&nbsp; His second headgear piece is a beanie piece in red with printed Spider-Man eyes on it, to resemble Peter lifting his mask over his face.&nbsp; The face LEGO used for Peter is the newer Ant-Man face introduced last summer in the <strong>Quantum Realm Explorers</strong>&nbsp;set.&nbsp; It isn&#39;t super accurate to either characters, really, but it isn&#39;t horrible.&nbsp; The torso is a new print with a gray jacket over a blue shirt, which is unbuttoned to show off a peek at his Spider-Man outfit underneath.&nbsp; Both the torso printing and the printed beanie are really awesome and useful parts.&nbsp; Peter&#39;s legs are unprinted dark blue ones.</p>

<p>The second minfigure&nbsp;in this set is MJ, and this is also our first time getting this character as a minfigure.&nbsp; The only new part of her, though, is her face print, which actually fits MJ very well.&nbsp; She has two expressions, both of which work nicely.&nbsp; MJ&#39;s hairpiece is the long ponytail piece in black, and her torso is a reused City torso - a gray jacket over a dark red shirt.&nbsp; I understand why they reused this since she only wears normal clothes anyways, but the lack of curve lines is kind of odd for a female character.&nbsp; Her legs are unprinted black ones.</p>

<p>The third minifigure is Mysterio, who is the only figure who is not exclusive since he comes in ALL THREE sets, so getting your hands on him is not difficult at all.&nbsp; He is a beautiful minifigure, however, so getting multiples of him really isn&#39;t all that bad.&nbsp; His bowl helmet is a new piece, which fits on a shiny silver head to give off a cloudy, concealed look underneath.&nbsp; His cape is a nice bright purple color, and his torso and legs show off some really fantastic gold, green, and purple designs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The final minifigure is Hydro-Man himself.&nbsp; His pieces are all molded in blue and azure colors, which are complimented with prints of the same colors.&nbsp; He has no printed legs, but his torso and head have some nice detail.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>The first part of the build is Hydro-Man&#39;s water tornado, which is built out of a ton of 2x2 windscreen slopes in translucent blue, each with a water stream sticker to finish the look.&nbsp; The build technique is pretty simple, but works well.&nbsp; Even if it isn&#39;t anything all that interesting to look at, it goes along with the rest of the set well.</p>

<p>Another side build included in the set is a small black gondola for MJ to travel in.&nbsp; There are some nice dark maroon pieces inside the seating area and a staff piece for MJ to paddle with.</p>

<p>Along with the set is a set of white spider web pieces for Spider-Man to use, much like the normal power blast pieces included in sets such as&nbsp;<strong>Thor&#39;s Weapon Quest</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main build comprises of a nice Venice bridge over a canal, accompanied by a small cafe.&nbsp; The bridge itself is a nice symmetrical design made up of sand colored bricks and slopes, as well as some nice &quot;brick texture&quot; pieces.&nbsp; The set gives you bricks with holes on the bridge to attach Spider-Man&#39;s web pieces if desired.&nbsp; Without the pieces, however, the various holes in the side of the bridge don&#39;t look too nice.&nbsp; The bridge gives plenty of space to display minfigures looking down at the water.&nbsp; There is a white build of poles and a small roof connecting them on the bridge to finish the decoration and design.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only big complaint I would have with the bridge itself is the spaces under the bridge that can be seen through the steps.</p>

<p>The cafe is probably my favorite part of the set, because it feels like something straight out of a modular city build.&nbsp; It&#39;s small, it&#39;s compact, but it does what it needs to well with an appealing color scheme and interesting part usage.&nbsp; The outside bridge of the cafe has room for a table and two chairs for Peter and MJ to enjoy some hot coffee beside the canal.&nbsp; There is one main play feature that launches one of the people in the chair by turning a lever, and it works surprisingly well for a launch feature.</p>

<p>The cafe itself has some nice white, brown, orange brown, and blue designs, and even&nbsp;really nice tree leave pieces growing on the roof for some more rustic and old design.&nbsp; The cafe has an open entrance, and a blue sloped brick on one side of the cafe facing the table and chairs has a sticker displaying the name of the cafe.&nbsp; There is a taller tower-looking build going further up from the roof, made up of more sand and brown pieces, and a large web piece hanging on the side to have Peter hanging from.</p>

<p>The interior of the cafe is pretty cramped, but has enoug space for a nice coffee dispenser build and a mug under it to fill up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Price</h2>

<p>This set retails for $39.99 in US dollars, which I&#39;m honestly convinced is a very fair price for a set with 471 pieces, and is also a very good sized playset.&nbsp; The build ended up being larger than I expected, and is definitely the best priced set of the wave, maybe even of the whole year.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall, I absolutely love this set.&nbsp; It&#39;s the best Marvel Super Heroes set I&#39;ve picked up in a while, and could be compared to last year&#39;s&nbsp;<strong>Sanctum Sanctorum Showdown&nbsp;</strong>which was also a fantastic playset.&nbsp; I absolutely adore the cafe and the bridge is a really refreshing and well scaled build.&nbsp; I would definitely recommend this set, for it&#39;s great minifigures and fatastic build.</p>

<p>Final rating: <strong>9/10</strong></p>

"Isj_rocks","2020-05-24T20:56:47.637Z","One of Marvels best sets!","<p><b>Introduction: </b>With the overflow of Lego Spider-Man sets with oversized pointless vehicles, this set is a nice change of pace. I appreciate all the effort lego put into this set, so without much more fanfare let&rsquo;s begin this review!</p>

<p><b>Minifigures:</b>&nbsp;Beginning with the minifigures of this set we have Mysterio. The Mysterio figure looks absolutely great, but the catch is he&rsquo;s in every set of the Far From Home wave, not counting the accessory pack from later that year. Once you get past his common appearances, he really is a great figure. His helmet piece is new here and is later reused for Mr. Freeze in the DC sets. I believe the glassy dome piece looks better here than on Mr. Freeze, but that is purely my opinion. Underneath the helmet piece is a silver head adding on to the glassy appearance. The torso has great detailing and you can tell Lego enjoyed blending the green, gold, and&nbsp;purple through this figure. I also enjoy the use of gold hands instead of purple. Looking now at Hydro Man, I feel like he was the biggest let down of the set, but I understand why Lego had him be a minifigure instead of a build like Molten Man. If you&rsquo;ve read my previous review on the Molten Man set you&rsquo;d know that I loved the decision Lego made in having him be a build instead of a minifigure. This Hydro Man minifigure, while it makes sense for him to be here, he&rsquo;d look a lot better in the form of a build. MJ is the next minifigure we&rsquo;ll be reviewing. A lot of people have complained about this figure due to it not looking much like the actress who portrays MJ. I think the head is spot on, but the rest of the figure is not accurate nor does it bring any value to the set. Last but not least the Peter Parker minifigure. This is a really great character&nbsp;portrayed well in minifigure form with everything except the head. I appreciate the mask piece, as well as a hair piece being included, but the head piece looks nothing like the interpretation of Peter Parker found in Spider-Man Far From Home. The torso here is great with the Spider-Man suit peeking out of his shirt, that detail, while not necessarily accurate, is welcome from Lego. Ranking the minifigures here I&rsquo;d say the Peter Parker is the best, then Mysterio, then MJ, and lastly Hydro Man. Let&rsquo;s look at the build now!</p>

<p><b>Build: </b>It is no secret to the Lego community that when it comes to themes like Marvel, DC, and even Ninjago they lazily throw mech suits and motorcycles at us, &nbsp;and sadly I&rsquo;d say 80% of the time they aren&rsquo;t accurate to any source material. Besides accuracy, I don&rsquo;t really want fourteen Hulk busters each year, all of this leads me to enjoy this set more. Looking first at my least favorite build, Hydro Man&#39;s tidal wave thing. I feel like this build really just makes the set feel too busy and frankly reminds me of how this Hydro Man interpretation isn&rsquo;t very good, and that one&nbsp;similar to what Molten Man got would&rsquo;ve been better. Next, the gondola build. I&rsquo;ve already mentioned my lack of appreciation for vehicles, but this small boat build is very nice. I wish a paddle piece had been included instead of this beige stick. Lastly looking at the bridge and restaurants. As someone who has never really been into the Lego Architecture theme I was surprised that I enjoyed the engaging detail of the tower build here. Below the tower a small Italian restaurant can be found along with much more great detailing among the build. Outside the restaurant a small dining arrangement can be found that leads up to the gorgeous bridge. There are many play features in which parts of the bridge can break off, which can be annoying if you plan to display the set, but if you want to use the set in play you&rsquo;ll enjoy a lot of the features included. It&rsquo;s these great location builds that make me love this year&#39;s Avengers Tower set. I definitely hope Lego continues to put effort into Lego Marvel like they did in this set.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion: </b>In conclusion I have to weigh the good of this set against some&nbsp;mistakes Lego made, and the things that could&rsquo;ve been done better. I think this set is definitely worth the $40 and that overall a lot of effort was put into this set, so that&rsquo;s my review!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-23T11:28:01.203Z","Perfectly Wonderful Set.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #76129 Hydro-Man Attack:</b> Spider-Man Far From Home was a huge success, but also almost cost the MCU their Spider-Man deal with Sony pictures. Fortunately all of that was sorted out. We got three sets for this MCU based film and one Minifigure based LEGO Store only pack, which covered much of the film&rsquo;s plotline and story without actually giving away too much.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The LEGO Marvel packaging of 2019 changed to be feature film thematic, meaning that each film in the MCU got its own unique design. In the case of Spidey&rsquo;s tie-ins, the boxes featured here are mostly a dark blue tone with a crosshatched pattern which matches the blue of Spidey&rsquo;s costume. Don&rsquo;t believe me? Check out the live action Spidey on the front of the box to verify.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">They also had LEGO versions of the characters on the side panels of the boxes which mimicked the action shot of the actual actor on the front. The action shot of the set on the front of the box is really impressive, showing the set really well and highlighting the fact that a whole bunch of new webbing elements have been introduced.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The back also shows off features of the set and includes a shot of all the new webbing elements so you can see what they all are. A nice thick cardboard stock manual with easy to follow along with build instructions and a sticker sheet also come in this set rounding out the typical offerings from a Marvel/DC Super Heroes set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Arches, Slopes, Windows, Bricks, Plates, Cylinders this set has it all in spades, with a massive amount of elements in trans clear blue as part of the build for Hydro-Man. The new webbing elements are introduced here and feature some nice spider web designs, you&rsquo;ve got string shots for action webbing, impact shots to show where spidey has hit and even a pair of web cuffs once he catches the bad guy. All highly versatile and fun add-ons for play with your LEGO Spider-Man sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Hydro-Man: This all blue Minifigure features some very fun water detailing alongside the typical torso and facial prints, but lacks any kind of printing in his legs or arms, to add more to the water look of the character it might have been nicer to use a clear blue leg colour instead, that way he could blend in fully with the tower build that serves as his extension element. That being said, it is nice to get the character in this set and not just have a brick-built variant.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">MJ: Here&rsquo;s Peter&rsquo;s girlfriend, a character who was not in the Spider-Man Homecoming sets appears now here for the first time, she has a decent torso design with a grey sweater jacket over a red shirt, no printing on her legs, but she does have a dual-sided face with a smiling expression on one side and a questioning expression on the other. It&rsquo;s what it looks like to me, her eyebrow is raised and her lip is quirked up as if she wants to ask something. No accessories.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Mysterio: This armored character looks great. He has awesome printing on his torso and legs showing off all of the gold accoutrements for his armor, and the purple cape hangs down nicely. The fishbowl helmet is a distinct and iconic visual, LEGO has managed to capture it perfectly, adding the flick-fire accessories for him gives him a complete look that just screams awesome.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Peter Parker: Coming with a host of accessories, Peter is very impressive. First he has a very nice torso, similar to the Clark Kent Minifigure from 2012, Peter is dressed in three layers, a shirt and jacket and his Spidey costume underneath. He has two distinct head pieces, a regular head of scruffy brown hair and a partially pulled down Spidey mask. He also comes with two expressions, happy smiles and worried fear.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The accessories are designed to make spider web based arsenal, there&rsquo;s firing webs, extending web shields and gripping webline for hanging on bars. He also has web-cuffs to capture the villain with. All-in-all a lot of accessories. You can even give him the spare pizza slice if you wanted.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Hydro-Man is built with this set, the Minifigure and the towering swirling vortex of water which is used to simulate him manipulating the environment. This build also includes a small gondola. Overall a highly impressive section, some stickers are used sparingly for added texture detailing on the water tower, but overall it&rsquo;s a quick and simple build. Just be sure you don&rsquo;t forget a step, with all the similar water bricks being used it is easy to miss something, as I discovered while building.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Peter Parker leaps to action to construct a portion of Vienna walk way, the basic underside of the model is built here, which involves some long bridge/arch pieces. Some of the elements are a bit stubborn as you work with them on anything other than a flat surface, I strongly suggest you build the model while on a table or hard floor.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: Here comes Mysterio in all his Minifigure glory, the rest of the column side of the model is built up here which includes part of the play features, not a whole lot to note during this build, aside from some nice use of parts for some classic detailing without relying on stickers or anything like that.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #4: MJ finishes off the model as she builds a small restaurant with outdoor seating area. Stickers will be placed here for menus and a newspaper, rather than printing a new element they decided on using a sticker. This section of the model builds quickly and solidly, there were no easy to miss moments or frustrating clutch power issues.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Vienna Building: This model is the largest and very play feature heavy, one section of walkway can be sent flying with a technic pin push, it can easily be restored for more exploding action. The tiny caf&eacute; table in the corner is resting on a trap door, push the technic pin and send the person seated there flying, be it MJ, Peter or Mysterio. There&rsquo;s some nice detailing here too, one section of watery canal houses a tiny mouse enjoying a slice of pizza, they also seem to have stolen a jewel of some kind. Is this Mouse an enemy of Spider-Man? Or what&rsquo;s more likely, this hidden jewel is actually one of the holographic emitters being used to &lsquo;fake&rsquo; the Hydro-Man attack.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Gondola: This is a very nice little model that fits in quite nicely with the overall look of the set. Not much else to say, you can fit two Minifigures in there.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Hydro Tower: This towering pedestal of water is made with transparent blue elements which makes it stand out pretty nicely. It&rsquo;s a unique looking idea to expand on Hydro-Man as a water construct, the only other thing to note is that stickers are used to add wave detailing to some of the sloped elements, adding the hint of motion.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Really love this set overall, pretty good details, nice recreation of the scene from the movie and excellent selection of Minifigures, all for a good price. The only downside of this set is the use of stickers for the newspaper tiles, considering LEGO has made Printed tiles for Gotham City and the Daily Bugle before, if memory serves, relying on a sticker here seems a bit of a waste.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Overall Highly Recommended. A great set for a great movie.</p>

"one79","2021-05-08T17:43:10.767Z","Spiderman in Venice!","<p>This set is taken from the Marvel Cinematic Universe - Spiderman: Far From Home film scene. It is depicting the Hydro attack in Venice where Peter Parker as Spiderman cooperated with Mysterio to defend the city from Hydro.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/t/5f3ad4e7b7bf4223b2a6ba71/1620491400359/LEGO+76129+review-3.jpg?format=1000w"" style=""width: 650px; height: 488px;"" /></p>

<p>First, the only minifigures with dual expression are Peter Parker and Mary Jane. Peter Parker has confidence grin and surprised expressions, while, Mary Jane has annoyed and confidence smile expressions. I have a single disappointment with the standard City torso used for Mary Jane minifigure. It is a common torso, and it does not look that good for female minifigure since it does not have curve lines. The torso for Peter Parker is good enough with his Spiderman suit peeking out. He has alternate headgear of the Spiderman Mask not covering his entire face. This set is also equipped with several accessories hat can be used as web slings shot by Peter Parker.</p>

<p>The Mysterio minifigure looks great with its trans clear dome-like helmet. His minifigure is not unique though since you can find it in two other Spiderman sets. Beside his own minifigure, Hydro also has its own water whirlpool-like construction build that looks interesting. At least, it looks more like in the film (albeit a bit blocky) rather than only represented by a mere minifigure.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/t/5f3ad5358a24266064556187/1620491410487/LEGO+76129+review-2.jpg?format=1000w"" style=""width: 650px; height: 488px;"" /></p>

<p>There are two unique mechanisms on this set. You can have the walkway on the center of the bridge to be blown forward to launch the minifigure towards the canal (knob located at the back of the bridge not shown in the photo). The other mechanisms is that you can launch one of the minifigure sitting on the cafe&rsquo;s chair upwards (you can see the Light Bluish Gray knob in the photo).</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/t/5f3ad51881384917431540bf/1620491446178/LEGO+76129+review.jpg?format=1000w"" style=""width: 650px; height: 488px;"" /></p>

<p>I like the architectural style of this build. It reminds me of the Architecture series on LEGO&reg;. This set will looks nice on any city Diorama either to be used it straight away or a bit modded. I just use it straight away on my city diorama which you can see on <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/B_jITJnp73M/?igshid=15z5qjqxcya6d"" tabindex=""0"">Raysbrickville instagram post</a>. The classical style of the bridge looks terrific, albeit, a bit simple. The bridge might seem to have&nbsp;pockmarks, but, they are studs used to attach all the webs effect from Spiderman webs. I really love the small cafe building with a small bell dome at the top (no bell inside the dome though). It is not a Venice without a gondola, therefore, we receive one brick-built gondola to complete the scene.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/t/5f3ad566ad115066c6d64b0d/1620491452287/LEGO+76129+review-5.jpg?format=1000w"" style=""width: 650px; height: 488px;"" /></p>

<p>As you can see from previous photo, the little cafe on this set is pretty detailed with two chairs, flowers, a mug, pizza slice and newspaper on the exterior. While on the interior, we can see a coffee maker machine that is filling one coffee mug.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/t/5f3ad54f3e0ea03be1f682cf/1620491459939/LEGO+76129+review-4.jpg?format=1000w"" style=""width: 650px; height: 488px;"" /></p>

<p>Seems the designer of the set is not satisfied enough. The designer provides us with additional scene of rat eating a pizza slice next to a hidden gem underneath plank near the docking place for the gondola. Overall, I am satisfied with this set and I do not regret in getting it.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>I have a great time building this set with its Venice style scene. This is a nice scene and it definitely a nice addition to any city diorama, or you can just display it on table, shelf, or anywhere you like. It beats building police station or fire station.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Enough parts to build this scene and I am pretty satisfied with it.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>A great playability especially with many features such as the collapsing bridge and flipping cafe table and chairs.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>It is ok, not to costly and not to cheap. Get it at discount.</p>

<p><strong>Special Note</strong></p>

<p>Please note that I write this review based on my own LEGO Blog article which is available from:&nbsp;<a href=""https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-set-review-76129-hydro-man-attack"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab."">https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-set-review-76129-hydro-man-attack</a>.</p>
