"Lego_fan_","2020-01-11T02:08:43.317Z","A must have!","<p>Lego set #853865 is the perfect edition to any Lego Movie of Lego movie 2 collection.</p>

<p>This set includes two Minifigures; Emmet, and Sharkira, two sewer babies, and a falling apart car.</p>

<p>Emmet is the normal Lego movie 2 Apocalypseburg&nbsp;Minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sharkira is exclusive to this set and has some cool print detail such as a chain, and gear belt.</p>

<p>The sewer babies are super cute and are seem to fit in right with their fellow Apocalypseburg&nbsp;citizens.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The run down car is super cool. It contains an antenna, a whell without the tire, a cross bow turret gun on top, and a crunched end as if a vehichle&nbsp;drove through it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall i think that this set is super fun and is a must have for any fan of the Lego movie 2.</p>

Well, there are a fair number of decent Minifigures in it. So to speak.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging &amp; Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I will combine this discussion because it is an Accessory Set, as with most of these sets it is packaged on a card with blister bubble. This is the older style of card, using a simple image of Apocalypseberg in the background and showing the set off on the back it&rsquo;s a really generic looking card.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As far as the parts are concerned you don&rsquo;t get a whole lot, roughly the number you&rsquo;d find in a Polybag, but it is a fun little model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Emmet: This version of Emmet is found in 8 sets total, the print and detail is the same as we&rsquo;ve seen before with the nervous frightened expression and the smiling expression on the opposite side. He includes no accessories.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Sewer Baby: As with the Sparkle Babies these little dudes are sharing parts. Printing is different between them, both are dressed in tattered brown baby outfits, but one has freckles and a gap-toothed grin while the other has a band over his or her eyes which matches the detailing on Sharkira.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Sharkira: This member of MetalBeard&rsquo;s crew has decked herself out in a load of armour, her print shows gears and metal plates taken from a vehicle or some sort to deck herself out in the post-apocalypse looking outfit. She even has two distinct legs, one regular looking with gear and belt pouch detailing while the other seems to have been replaced with a metal leg of some sort.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build &amp; completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The model included in this set looks like the front end of a car which has been torn apart in the battle for Bricksburg. It includes front grille detailing and a single hubcap, attached to it is a bowcaster stud launcher and features something that may be a window wiper or a radio antenna. It is built out of fairly common elements and looks great, for an accessory set. Most of the Minifigures can fit on it, but it is a bit of a tight fit for all four of them.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a pretty decent accessory set, it compliments the Welcome to Apocaypseburg set quite well and I would suggest getting this alongside with that massive set to add to the display and characters in that set. I&rsquo;d recommend it, but I would also recommend trying to get it at a discount. The piece count is a bit high for 17$ CND after all. Recommended.</p>
