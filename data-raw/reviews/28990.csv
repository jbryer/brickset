<p>This set is to go along side the card packs for free at the same time .</p>

<p>Contense-</p>

<p>This is ok and good for storing the cards but other than that it is rendered useless .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>I have no clue why Lego pushed tlm2 in many werid products&nbsp;like props and trading cards over all there is absolutely no reason to get this .</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-01-31T13:46:40.177Z","Interesting Novelty","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>#5005777 The LEGO Movie 2 Awesome Collector Album:</b> Back in February when The LEGO Movie 2 came out, has it really been that long? Either way, back in February as part of the promotion with The LEGO Movie 2, LEGO offered up free giveaways. Foil Packs of Trading Cards and this Collector&rsquo;s Album, which included a bonus card as part of the set. A certain price range needed to be met when spent to get three packs of cards, and the album. Making it rather difficult to acquire all of the cards, and getting you to trade with friends.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Presentation</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The material used for this Collector Album is pretty solid. It was a decent card stock and worked fairly well, the interior shows some images and includes slots for sliding cards into them. There&rsquo;s some nice quotes also included and each card slot features the name of the character, set or vehicle which is depicted on the card.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Contents</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The book is set up by section, with spaces to hold cards focused on Apocalypseburg, the Sys-Tar System and Queen Watevra&rsquo;s &lsquo;So-Not-Evil&rsquo; Space Palace. I find the album to work well, but I also felt that the slot system was poorly conceived as the cards and pages in the album are both equally thick. Meaning you might tear or bend something that shouldn&rsquo;t have just to get it to fit.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Getting this on the Secondary Market is the only way to get it anymore, and collecting all 36 cards will be very difficult. Especially considering how hard it actually was to get all 36 cards and the card packs, which have never been offered for sale after the fact. I am still personally missing 6 cards from the set of 36, which is unfortunate. I don&rsquo;t recommend tracking this down, it is nice to own as a collector&rsquo;s item if you got it back in February during the promotion, but unless this is given to you as a gift you definitely shouldn&rsquo;t break the bank trying to acquire the 36 cards with album. Not Recommended.</p>
