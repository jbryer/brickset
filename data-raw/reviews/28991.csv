"Odeinoichus","2021-01-31T13:44:30.117Z","Marketing Strategy Explosion","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #5005775 The LEGO Movie 2 Awesome Trading Cards:</b> Part of marketing in February of 2019, LEGO released a series of Trading Cards and gave them away free with every purchase of products that month. A free album was also included which we&rsquo;ve discussed previously. Now we get to discuss the actual cards.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Presentation</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The packaging was a foil pack with a shot of Rex, Emmet, Wildstyle and Sweet Mayhem in her space gear. Not much to say here, moving on the card stock inside we find a very solid card stocks. There isn&rsquo;t much on the cards, but we&rsquo;ll get to that momentarily. Collecting multiple packs is how you complete a series, and this is a fairly decent offering as far as free giveaways go.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Contents</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The cards are printed on a decent card stock and some of them even feature a very impressive glittery gloss finish to them to show off the &lsquo;Hero&rsquo; or Main characters. You receive four random cards in each pack, for free that&rsquo;s not too bad, I wouldn&rsquo;t pay 5$ a pack just for 4 cards, which seems to be the norm with most collectible cards these days. I seem to recall getting at least ten in a pack when I was young, but that was the 1980s, a time when cards didn&rsquo;t cost as much to produce.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Comparing these cards to other types, they are somewhat thicker than most cards included with Chima Speedorz or original Ninjago Spinners. They are meant to be traded as well, meaning that you need to spend a lot on orders to get a full set if you don&rsquo;t have anyone near you also collecting and trading.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I got a fair number of packs as you were given three with every order exceeding a certain amount, but even with getting up to twelve packs I never did manage to get a complete set. And the number of duplicates adds up to eight and a half packs, and LEGO never made these available after the month of February so good luck getting a complete set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">These items were a fairly decent idea, I actually like the cards for what they are, but I do wish it had been easier to complete the set. On top of that, the backs of the cards are all the same bland imagery, no special write-ups on the characters, not even a little quote, just the same trademark information and the image seen on the front of the foil pack. Overall I wouldn&rsquo;t spend a fortune trying to get a full set of these, but I do still like them and am glad LEGO made them. If they were sold in shops I would at least give them a recommendation depending on the price, but as it is, it isn&rsquo;t a must-have item. Just a nice, freebie given away when The LEGO Movie 2 was in full release.</p>
