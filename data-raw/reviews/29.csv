"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-02T19:43:24Z","Just great.....","I understand that it is really expensive for the size of the set but I think it is worth it. After all it is an UCS! Anyhow, I just love the sleek look of this set. This causes this set to look amazingly accurate. The ship also has a special cockpit. I also like the chrome! It is a real beauty! The bottom is grey but you won't even notice it. The display stand allows you to show of the model in any angle you want and also has one of those cool cards that show all the facts about the ship. I highly recommend this set even though it is a bit of a rip-off.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Jedd_the_Jedi","2007-09-04T02:03:30.16Z","Pricey but Beautiful","This has got to be one of the utterly smallest UCS sets that ever went into production. However, it does bring out the lovely sleekness of the ship far better than its blocky predecessor. Also, the chromed parts are very hard to come by. Still, it is far too expensive for a set its size, even with the chrome included.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Leggodt94","2007-12-02T11:05:54.873Z","I can't stop staring at it","This set is soooo SHINY. And I love that about it. It is my first UCS set (I'm not really into the UCS.) And I have to say, its design and flare is impecable. However, it did not come with any minifigs, but that's okay 'cause it's a UCS set and oh ya, IT'S NOT SUPPOSED TO COME WITH MINIFIGURES! If I could some this set up in one word it would be BRILLIANT! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"darthdc","2009-09-02T16:26:10.92Z","Great looking set - too many stickers!","Possibly the smallest UCE Star Wars set ever. This model is probably the most accurate model of the Naboo Starfighter (until the recent minifig version with the droid fighter).

Pros

Chrome parts
Podium is hinged allowing for various display poses

Cons

Stickers - those on mine have already peeled off and crackled, including the stats one. Cannot get replacements. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legofan266","2011-07-14T03:02:56.707Z","Wow So Shiny!!","<p><strong>Naboo N-1 Starfighter (UCS):</strong></p>
<p>This set dosn't include any minifigures, but I have to admit it's really awesome. The ship is just so shiny. Several chrome elements used in this set that are completely unique. Very nice and colourful, but a bit small for a UCS type set. This set does include R2-D2's head, not the rest of the body. This set is just beautiful not matter how you look at it and I must say it may be small, but it's just that unique in design and the look of the pieces, it's just that cool. A stand in also included in this set, with an exclusive display card. This ship is beautiful and I would say that I would really recommend it, although it was and is a little pricey :D</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>Good set to get, if your really into Ultimate Collectors sets, but keep in mind that this set was $40USD back in 2002, so it's not going to ba very cheap and ofcourse it's wasn't cheap for back then either. If you can find for a good price used, definitely really cool to get.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>
<p>- Use of exclsive chrome pieces</p>
<p>- very nice unique display card</p>
<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>
<p>- Stickers (not many though)</p>
<p>- very pricey for the size and the piece amount</p>

"ra226","2012-03-02T14:59:03.153Z","Not a toy, but an awesome model","<p>This is a great looking model. &nbsp;It's awesome. &nbsp;Well-formed, no glaring flaws, and gorgeous chrome parts. &nbsp;It's not for everyone, however.</p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Chrome parts</li><li>Accurate representation</li><li>Display stand and data placard</li></ul>

<ul><li>Price--both then and even moreso now</li><li>Stickers. &nbsp;Not just annoying, but they decay over time</li></ul>
<p></p><div>This is more of a model, not really a play set. &nbsp;It has no minifigs and no little auxiliary vehicles, but it does come on a display stand with a data card, just as the other UCS sets do. &nbsp;It's the most acurate Lego representation of the ship. &nbsp;Yes, even though R2 is just a head (if you look at the actual fighter from the movie, it's obvious that R2 must have his body separated from his legs to fit in the droid socket--presumably this is a standard feature of astromech droids).</div><div><br></div><div>So since the only place you'll find it now is eBay or Bricklink, ""Value for money"" was the hardest one to rank for this one, but I gave it 3/5. &nbsp;It was overpriced then, and it's overpriced now, but you don't buy this model for the parts or the price. &nbsp;You buy it because you love Lego and you love this particular ship from Star Wars. &nbsp;I'm very glad I payed what I did for this set back when it was in production. &nbsp;Would I spend the $150 plus to acquire it now? &nbsp;Not a chance. &nbsp;Not because I don't love it, but it's just too expensive these days.</div><div><br></div><div>Only other complaint is regarding the stickers. &nbsp;They decay over time, and replacements are not easy to come by. &nbsp;The data card on mine has completely cracked and rotted into pieces--fortunately I scanned it at 600 dpi before it was too late and restored it to perfection in photoshop...</div><div><br></div><div>As a side note, there's plenty of space inside to hack some electronics in--I added blue LEDs behind the engines and wired them to a flickering circuit. &nbsp;It's a nice effect :)</div><p></p>",TRUE,5,5,3,3,3
