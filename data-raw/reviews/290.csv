<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Lots of detail for kitchens!</li><li>The back of the box makes a screen!</li><li>Chairs!</li><li>Food!</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Not much building.</li><li>Obviously, it's Duplo.</li></ul>
<h4>Overall:</h4><p>Well, this set is great if you have a small child or if you are a small child. This set would probably be more suitable for girls. Boys might like the 1408 instead.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, this set will be great for small children, or for big kids making a Duplo house!</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,2,3
