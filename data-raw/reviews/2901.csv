My only complaint would be that I think they should have made it bigger...but then it would have cost more and it was expensive enough as it is...its not a cheap set but worth it if you really like belville.",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0

Big pieces for weak little hands, lots of cute girlish stuff, and good support for the winter castle on the Lego web site (games and stories that the kids actually like to play). 

Obviously juniorized but that's OK for the target audience. 

The selection of little parts like plates, food, goblets, diamonds, drawers, etc is excellent for people who want to create detailed Lego MOCs, but I wouldn't spend all that money  just for those little bits.
