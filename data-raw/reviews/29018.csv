"LSWFan","2019-08-16T13:46:24.977Z","Some reading, some building and some adventures","<p>This Build Your Own Adventure book is the second in the Star Wars line and is a decent value model, figure and book combination.</p>

<p>It features a few loose stories, told through the usual excellent DK LEGO photography and some quite witty writing. The layout, design and feel of the book is really good. It&#39;s beautifully put together and a joy to read through.</p>

<p>Being a Build Your Own Adventure book, the idea is that the various small models featured can be built by the reader using the LEGO bricks in their collection. This is a good concept but tricky to execute: a number of the models have details and certain part requirements which need a wide range of LEGO bricks, obviously including Star Wars sets and ranging right through to LEGO Technic parts.</p>

<p>Of course, you can work with what you have and the argument goes that your imagination is a key component to having fun with LEGO, so the book can be used as more of a guide than a set of instructions. It does include the latter however, for the included Cloud Car model and its pilot. This is an interesting choice for such a book, as it&#39;s a vehicle which hasn&#39;t featured too much in the LEGO world. It has a design similar to the Microfighters range and looks OK when completed. The pilot wears an authentic but slightly dull Cloud City uniform and carries a small grey blaster. It&#39;s all fine but not as good as the Y-Wing and pilot featured in the previous LEGO Star Wars Build Your Own Adventure book.</p>

<p>BYOA: Galactic Missions is an&nbsp;engaging read, with some nice model ideas. It&#39;ll stretch your building skills (and brick collection) and you get an exclusive, if slightly dull, Cloud Car. Pretty good value for the money and worth a look.</p>

<p>The Lego star wars build your adventure book came as a surprise birthday gift for me and this model in particular looks a greater amount better in person rather than the specific angle for the image on the cover of the box/book .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The Minifigure is rather nice being a lone Bespin guard and my&nbsp; first of the character although Lego did have cloud car pilots at the time that&#39;s a bit weird but alright as I have a spare cloud car pilot&nbsp; from the 2019 advent calendar anyway the figure has a regular blue unprinted officer cap , a stern facial expression , a very nice torso and some unprinted blue legs , he wields a pump piece in light grey as a blaster .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The main back spine is a 2&times;8 red plate running through the middle connecting both pods , the centre has a thruster assembly using snots and a 2&times;2 red tile with a 1&times;2 trans light&nbsp;blue tile at the back and a 1&times;2 dark grey grille at the front , both pods are built on two curved bases each with a snot build at the back attaching two 2&times;2 red slopes that make a perfect curve at the back ,on the inner side there is a dark grey slope , a trans black windshield and a printed 1&times;2 dark grey console in each , there is a four stud space for the guard and on each of the out wards sides there is a stud shooter with a red plate and slope attached to make it more grounded , it shoots trans orange studs and the nose of each pod has a large red slope that gives it&nbsp; the pointed cone shape of their universe cloud cars and this build is mirrored on each side .&nbsp;</p>

<p>The book-</p>

<p>The book is very childish but still fun and entertaining with about 3/4 of its depth taken up by a box for the bag that stored all of the pieces , the rest of the book is dedicated to creativity so it has parts pages , Naboo themed mocs , Corellia themed mocs , Scarif themed mocs , Bespin themed mocs , Jakku themed mocs and instructions for the build included .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a pretty good build your own adventure book , the build is substantial and the figure is nice I don&#39;t see much wrong with it , personally I get the vibe of this build being an upscaled microfighter so overall I recommend it .&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-01-31T18:17:12.05Z","Very Enjoyable Experience.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>LEGO Star Wars Build Your Own Adventure Galactic Missions:</b> This is the second book I have gotten with this basic play design, with some decent storytelling and fun inspiring builds to make with your parts collection to expand on the adventures of LEGO Star Wars characters. As I noted in the previous review this style is better than the Brickmaster novels in execution and shelf space, but the lack of alternative models may turn some folks off.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Presentation</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The presentation of this set is highly impressive, I mean book, did I say set? Yes, this is a book, the book is thin and stored inside of a large slip-case that also holds a tray for the large Polybag. There are pictures all around the package of the included model and Minifigure and also includes some of the fun clever models you will find inside on the back. The book itself is really impressive too with excellent artwork showing the style of humour you&rsquo;ll find inside.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The pages are nicely printed as well and showcase the contents in a colorful and fun way.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bespin Guard: The included polybag model features this wonderful character. A unique Minifigure not seen in any other cheaper sets, the print for his torso is very well done and the parts are all complimentary. It might have been nice to see two Pilots in this set for the two seats of the Twin-Pod Cloud Car model, but I can see where that might have been cost prohibitive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Contents</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This book focuses on LEGO Star Wars eras, you&rsquo;ll find reference to everything in the Skywalker Saga, but it mostly includes chapters inspired by The Phantom Menace, Solo, Rogue One and The Sequel Trilogy. As well as The Empire Strikes Back to coincide with the included Microfighter style model of the Cloud Car.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The instructions in the back for building the model are very well done and you can read the contents in a few hours while enjoying all of the images and pictures you find inside for each of the inspiring models the Master Builders created for this books photography.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This was a great buy at Costco in 2019 and features some very enjoyable content. I do like these styles of books as they are easier to handle when building the model included inside. The price still seems a tad high with 15$ for the book and 15$ for the Polybag of parts. Since it is 31.99$ CND at most major retailers. I seriously think this is a bit of a rip off and am pleased that Costco has offered these at 16.99$ most years which allows you to purchase these at a much better price per piece ratio. So I&rsquo;d recommend picking this up if you can find it at Costco. Recommended.</p>
