The set comes packaged in a sturdy chipboard slipcase which contains&nbsp;a hardback book&nbsp;and a separate&nbsp;thin, cardstock&nbsp;box which holds the Lego set inside. The part inventory is printed on the front of the box. A&nbsp;polybag with the Lego set is inside the box. US MSRP: $24.99<br />

<strong>Lego Set</strong><br />
(#11923&nbsp;- 101 pcs, Ages 6+ as printed on polybag)<br />
1 Harry Potter minifigure&nbsp;(short non-moving legs) with wand sprue<br />
1 Sorting hat<br />
4 2x2 metallic printed house crest tiles<br />
1 book w/ 1x2 printed tile page<br />
1 Treasure chest<br />
2 candlesticks w/ transparent orange flame elements<br />
2 transparent orange fire elements</p>

<p>The first&nbsp;configuration of the 2-in-1 set is a &quot;Sorting Hat Spinner&quot;. The second configuration is a &quot;Magical Fireplace&quot; that rotates making&nbsp;minifigures disappear behind the wall. I love the playability of the magic fireplace. The downside is that you can only build one or the other at a time with the bricks provided.</p>

<p>The printed house crest tiles are lovely!&nbsp;The only other set I&#39;m aware of that includes them is the 2019 HP Lego advent calendar. I&#39;m not a fan of stickers on bricks so I love the ability to replace them with printed tiles wherever possible.</p>

<p><strong>Book:</strong><br />
The book is approximately 8&quot;x10&quot; with 77 full-color pages and high-resolution images. The last 14 pages&nbsp;are dedicated to the building instructions for the 2-in-1 set included.</p>

<p>The book provides ideas&nbsp;for&nbsp;23 Harry Potter-themed&nbsp;Lego builds. It does not provide explicit instructions for&nbsp;each idea, but it does give some notes on construction&nbsp;techniques and elements used.&nbsp;Generally, the photos are clear&nbsp;enough for an experienced builder to get the gist of how each build is&nbsp;constructed.<br />
<br />

<p><strong>Cons:</strong><br />
My only issue&nbsp;is that&nbsp;the builds featured typically require&nbsp;unique elements&nbsp;that don&#39;t appear in the current Harry Potter &amp; Fantastic Beasts sets. If you want to build everything presented, you&#39;ll have to do some hunting to buy the necessary&nbsp;pieces.<br />
It would have been nice if they had limited the builds to pieces found in the&nbsp;current HP/FB sets and basics&nbsp;in&nbsp;the Classic brick boxes; or barring that, provided part numbers for pieces used so you could order them.</p>

<p>All in all, it&#39;s a fun&nbsp;Lego set and a great book. It gave me a lot of neat ideas for my own Wizarding World creations!</p>

I am only focusing&nbsp;on the building part of the book so for you LEGO book lovers out there, sorry :\. The set was a great edition to my full Hogwarts collection but it had a few flaws. The building experience was good but I didn&#39;t really enjoy the 2nd&nbsp;build. it ws just so bland. The parts are helpful especially&nbsp;the hat. It was a cheaper way to get it. the playability was great because it had so many action features and the two n&#39; on thing. but the value for money was not very good. it was like 25$ for a book and about 110 pieces. over all though, I&nbsp;just LOVE the way it fits into my great hall display.</p>
