I was very pleased with the value and the pieces included in this set.  Belville is a wonderful series for imitation of real life to the detail without going as far as SCALA.  I like the two girls included and you put the tent for them to sleep in as well as the sleeping bags included with the set.  It even has a pony for the girls to out trekking.  I would recommend any other Belville fans to buy this set if it is still available.  A classic.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
