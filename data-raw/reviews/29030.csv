"East64","2019-06-07T17:52:24.89Z","Great Minifigs and Main Build!","<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<p>The main build here looks excellent, the construction of the main body and the legs is interesting and well put together. The use of that seafoam green and a bit of tan works really well for the theme and there are only 2 stickers required.</p>

<p>Darth Vader minifig! Enough said. Also the Kashyk clone trooper is fantastic.</p>

<p>The little side 4 legged droid is actually pretty cool. The main &#39;head&#39; of that thing is a pretty weird build and involves parts that I probably won&#39;t ever use again, but the parts are at least unique and it ends up being a fun little addition.</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<p>The turret for the&nbsp;wookie is pretty meh, repetitive build for something that doesn&#39;t have much display value, its supposed to look like a fortified installation but the &#39;rock&#39; pieces are so low it doesn&#39;t look very good in person and the wookie has a gun included anyways. The turret also can&#39;t actually be held without modification</p>

<p>The pose-ability is surprisingly bad here. The legs don&#39;t bend or angle, and the main gun doesn&#39;t angle up or down, so the walker is pretty much just going to look like how it looks standing up straight. You won&#39;t be able to stage a battle scene with this thing fighting ground troops.</p>

<p><b>Value</b></p>

<p>For the price of $30 I think this is actually not bad given the minifigs included and that you get a really nice display model out of it. Seriously, given the part count and the fact that a lot of the&nbsp;parts included aren&#39;t even part of the min build the walker stands very tall and will fit in on the shelf among some larger more expensive builds. I also found this at target for $20 so I got fantastic value and I think if you search for it you should be able to find it at a discount as well.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>The main build for me would be an easy 5/5 if it had more articulation to pose it, the turret side build is mostly useless and the other is kinda fun but because of the lack of pose-ability of the main build you can&#39;t really pair them up well for display so it&#39;ll likely hang out with your polybag collection. Minifig selection here is outstanding, Vader is iconic of course and the scout trooper is just awesome too, great helmet design and great printing. If you&#39;re a fan of Star Wars and like the walkers in particular as I am I would highly recommend.</p>

"tye","2019-08-18T23:33:26.347Z","Awesome remake","<p>I really am glad Lego decided to remake some of their older Lego Star Wars sets because they really are worth it and shows the huge improvements Lego has made over the years.</p>

<p>I am going to compare the old 2005&nbsp;Clone Scout Walker to this new one.</p>

<p>Pros: Better design, detail more minifigures.</p>

<p>Cons: I am not a fan stud shooter but at least the figures in this set have proper blasters which is much appreciated. Stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build of the walker itself has more detail and the building techniques I found to be innovative and fun as a whole.</p>

<p>The only complaint I have is the Spider droid has a stud shooter but is fun for the kids. And I wish the Wookiee defense was a little more like a proper wall rather than a foxhole. But the design for the trench gun is great.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>Main part of the set is AT-RT - Clone scout walker. Vehicle&nbsp;was seen in Clone Wars and in Revenge of the Sith. This version in particular take part in battle on Kashyyyk. Model is quite tall, much bigger than it should be in minifigure scale, but still looks awesome. Legs are made well, has some nice details like dishes on a side. It&nbsp;is stable only in one position, which is a big flaw, but it often happens in this type of crafts. I like the way they made fingers on foot and overall shape of foot.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/gbdRvMbeIGR2P0OImHtipjafDdBpvOKSOSpkJWjUe5BuYqXwmb17kUrGk1PuxNf6SZWAiQXYqAiTVYiA8UcDUai25LYmhZENmVyKr8scOpfTzjuGiTxYtoNlv_dzJ6Hi7oE-nL4aGxU=w2400[/img]</p>

<p>&ldquo;Head&rdquo; is pretty straight forward. There are mostly standard bricks stack together. But still they manage to put some fine details inside. There is a kind of fender piece&nbsp;that could mimic foot resting pads. At the back there are also some grill tiles attached at the side. Couple of technic bricks that made pipes at the base looks fantastic, but blue pin is a big flaw. There is a seat for one pilot. At the back there is a pair of antennas.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kvYKsxYW6EEjV3efgeXTaKmZySiaY3Qz5CxczJWcqNjoPF49L6CaLev7ZRz9cXZAMB1lZmvrj9ghdhAar6leE4BmqoNeG0guxy4chZDSVQX6-TfGGVMxkJwJIirjZjEe1JZ6i0eT49g=w2400[/img]</p>

<p>Front panel is clearly the best part of this craft. It has great curved shape. Flaps are also designed perfectly. There are also two stickers at that part, which add a lot. Turret looks good, nothing to fancy. It can be turned around. Stud shooter is good for younger children. I think there should be some more bricks used in this turret, &#39;cause it looks a bit unfinished, yet it is still good work.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/0YM-fU_9ufrNP_KU1iaTK7oz_L5Tdvy9E_Sdhjl4elm7W-phgYFgDnxEPVmSSvd_6InOsYGiicSBMCKyvFpbt22K4IIwsZV8QpfJQbmWAqmpct6HwoqtjRJB9ef5uAeHt382DMeamfs=w2400[/img]</p>

<p>First side build is small trench for Wookie. It is a really nice small thing, can be form in nearly round shape, and has long rifle with some shields on sides. Good addition to the set.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Pvn3XoXXNNFFkZ1P-FjNXz5XEeD1DEKbXNtLyHK19EPkAIg5fAfRbSQnJ0Z6dZzOUuXsvybOKuIHlBG2TWdEv56od7kg_7uBf9h86SghZVmfepZItv-IIocEns-XfTgW2okWqGkIqkk=w2400[/img]</p>

<p>Last part of the scene is spider droid. I had one before, but this is different. I think it looks OK. Only a few parts, but makes a good-looking droid. Its legs can move, nose canon is a stud shooter and can be turned around, antenna on top also is movable. I like the addition of old type of phone part, which still looks cool.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>250 parts in this set. Rather typical ones. Some interesting colours, like dark tan or sand green. Big amount of new rock pieces is great, also worth noticing are 6 small dishes. Overall parts are good, but not very special.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Clone scout trooper &mdash; great looking fig. I love his green camo-like uniform. He has many pockets attached to his armour. Legs also have some great print. At the back there is also some print of his armour and tactical belt. Helmet is a great mold, is also perfectly painted. I wish they made a helmet with opening visor, like we can see in Rebels. But this is good enough. Clone has standard face and is equipped with medium size blaster.</li>
	<li>Wookie warrior uses the same legs and body as Chewie, But his head is different. It is rather simple. I like the lighter print around his face, eyes are printed perfectly and also his teeth are great. Body is plain dark brown, legs use a print of fur, which adds a lot to this figure. Warrior is equipped with old style pirate rifle.</li>
	<li>Battle droid is battle droid. His mold haven&#39;t changed since 1999. Good fig, but I wish we get like two or three of them in this set. He uses a medium size blaster.</li>
	<li>Darth Vader is always a welcome fig. Print on his body is very simple, but still looks cool, even though it&#39;s 20 years old. At his back he has big silver print of 20th anniversary logo, which looks weird, but is covered&nbsp;with cape. I love the old face print, and old type of helmet is also great. He has red lightsaber with silver hilt (not chrome)</li>

"vikings","2020-01-01T05:09:41.25Z","Great Walker","<p>This is a great Battle of Kashyyyk set (especially if you have the 2014 sets from the Battle of Kashyyyk). This is also a very similar walker to the 2013 75002 AT-RT Walker.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>The box is a medium-small size box. The is thin and short in length. The instructions are normal size for a $30 set. They are clear and easy to follow. On the inside of the instructions&nbsp;they show the improvements made on the old 2005 7250 Clone Scout Walker. It also shows the other collectable figures you get in the other 20th anniversary sets. It also has a little thing on the Battle of Kashyyyk</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get a couple unique parts in this set. The dwarf spider droid has a fencing sword, and an old school telephone for its eyes. The light green pieces are also cool to get. Other than that there aren&#39;t any&nbsp;special parts you get in this set. The total piece count is 250.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>You get four minifigures in this set: Battle Droid, Wookie Warrior, Kashyyyk Scout Trooper, and 20th Anniversary Darth Vader.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Battle Droid:</strong></p>

<p>This is the same model as the all the others. There is no special printing or anything. Comes with the usually blaster.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Wookie&nbsp;Warrior:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Wookie warrior is a great figure to get in this set. The detail with&nbsp;the different fur colors on the head and legs is very good. He is armed with a brown rifle.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Kashyyyk Scout Trooper:</strong></p>

<p>The Kashyyyk Scout Trooper is the exact same as it was back in 2014. The helmet is still the same (I prefer the older version of the scout trooper helmets) Has printing on both his body and legs. The printing and detail on his body, legs, and helmet is all very good.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>20th Anniversary Darth Vader:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The 20th anniversary Darth Vader is an exact replica of the Darth Vader from 1999. Has a single piece helmet and a hard cape. He has printing on his body and nothing on his legs. Has the original grey head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall the figures are great.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was easy nothing hard or difficult. It took me around 20-30 minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:</strong></p>

<p>After I finished it, I was really happy with it. Everything goes together nicely. The ground defense&nbsp;with heavy turret is okay. There is nowhere for a figure to grab and move it around. The ground defense part is somewhat loose and moves a lot when picking it up and moving it. But it is great for display for the Wookies and Clone Troopers. The Dwarf Spider droid is pretty good. I&#39;m personally not a fan of the stud shooter for its cannon. It just doesn&#39;t look right. Besides that it is really good. It very sturdy&nbsp;due to the clear 2x2&nbsp;round brick under it. The walker is really good. Again I&#39;m not a fan of the stud shooter for the cannon. Other than that this is really good. This is a very similar AT-RT to the 2013 75002 AT-RT Walker. There are a few differences like: The cannon with the stud shooter, the antenna on the back, and the front armor is slightly different (Which I do like). The legs and feet are the same as before but still look amazing. Overall I this is an improvement from the 2013 version.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great addition to the Battle of Kashyyyk. The ground defense, dwarf spider droid, and the AT-RT are all great. All are great additions to the rest of the Battle of Kashyyyk sets (If you have them) or just adding another set to your star wars collection. This is also a great army builder set. The figures are great. The walker is much better than the one from 2013. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Kaisermighe","2019-12-29T15:34:10.38Z","Nice Kashyyk battle scene with cool walker","<p>The All Terrain Recon Transport was a one-man walker used for scouting, civil patrol and combat in difficult environment during the Clone Wars (and at the beginning&nbsp;of the Empire).&nbsp;Lego has released two sets for this vehicle in the past, from ROTS in 2005 and from&nbsp;TCW in 2013 (based on the Battle of&nbsp;Umbara&nbsp;in Season 4). In-universe this walker should be less than 4 metres&nbsp;tall, so the size is wrong, it should have been half-sized. Which is weird, because coupled with bigger vehicles (such as with the Clone Turbo Tank) sometimes&nbsp;Lego has done right-size&nbsp;AT-RTs.&nbsp;But this way we get more details so it has some sense.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall the set took me less than&nbsp;40 minutes to build. There are 2 stickers. The building process was good thanks to having plenty of different little things to build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set comes with 4 minifigures. It&#39;s an awesome bundle, specially&nbsp;coupled with the vehicles for playability value. Like it&#39;s very funny, you could reenact the Battle of Kashyyk and the Order 66 or pretend that&nbsp;Vader and the Imperial Walker are hunting down the remaining wookies&nbsp;(which might have reprogrammed old battle droids to help them). Also i should mention that each minifig has its own true&nbsp;non&nbsp;stud-shooter&nbsp;weapon, which is awesome these days.</p>

<p>The scout trooper with the colours of the 41st Elite Corps is wonderful and has plenty of details, even thought the real driver would appropriately&nbsp;be an AT-RT Driver, but in some screens of&nbsp;ROTS we see scout troopers driving this, so it&#39;s fine.</p>

<p>The wookie warrior is very well done and it makes a fine couple with the clone representing the native&nbsp;race of Kashyyk&nbsp;defending his homeland against invasion. The Standard B1 Battle droid is&nbsp;an&nbsp;old classic, but i &#39;m getting tired of this.</p>

<p>Best minifig&nbsp;is Darth Vader classic design made for the 20th anniversary edition!. Vader adds a lot from both play and display point of view. It comes with his display stand and has back printing covered by the cape. Playing him against the walker is very funny, and it&#39;s kinda of&nbsp;a cheap way of gaining a sith lord if you haven&#39;t got the chance yet.</p>

<p>The trench section with an anti-tank gun is a pretty&nbsp;weak&nbsp;build. It&#39;s undeniably a poor segment, it just doesn&#39;t seem credible, it would have been better with some more bricks making it taller&nbsp;and having a way of keeping a gunner in place. Still it might&nbsp;be useful to play with.</p>

<p>The Spider droid in light-grey&nbsp;has some nice parts, such as articulations on lower legs, but some other parts such as the&nbsp;higher legs and shooting beak that i don&#39;t like very much, it feels too much bulky. It works perfectly to play with, having also a stud-shooter which could be turn with a ball joint mechanism. This represents&nbsp;the true Separatist threat here, the B1 Battle droid doesn&#39;t really do a lot on his own...</p>

<p>And finally the main thing, the AT-RT Walker itself! From a display point of view, it looks very good. It&#39;s pretty tall at 15cm&nbsp;but at the same time&nbsp;it doesn&#39;t take too much space on a shelf. The level of details is stunning, also love the colour scheme grey-sand green and sand. There&#39;s a seat with a handlebar for the driver, and also two holes for weapons in front of him. The main weapon of the walker&nbsp;is the chin-mounted&nbsp;laser cannon up&nbsp;front, which could move&nbsp;left-right, unfortunately not&nbsp;down enought to catch incoming foot troops if they get too close. It also has a stud-shooter which is fine, because it doens&#39;t detracts from the design. The legs are articulated but not in a very good range of motion, like you can&#39;t really put an inspiring pose for display. When playing with it it becomes quite clear that it&#39;s not that sturdy, for instance if you put too much pressure when connecting the driver to his&nbsp;handlebar the feets could disconnect, also there are some elements in the flanks that are flimsy. The antenna on the back is very well made and looks perfect.</p>

<p>Overall i think it&#39;s a&nbsp;quite good&nbsp;deal at 25$, thought not more. It&#39;s really a mix between a collector&#39;s pack and a very friendly playset&nbsp;. It could have been perfect with another minifig, maybe a Super Battle droid, and some more bricks around the trench, but all in all i&#39;m&nbsp;satisfied. For me it works best as a support or as a starting point&nbsp;for the&nbsp;Battle of Kashyyk, and i&#39;m very glad about the walker and Vader about the display value as well. So i would recommend this set to any Kashyyk/Episode 3 fan who wants more or maybe to someone who doesn&#39;t have an AT-RT. If you already have the minifigs and/or the walker thought, i think you could skip this. There is no new striking design here that&#39;s not already been seen, so there you go.</p>

They are pretty much stuck in the position you see in the pictures; moving them backwards is just fine, but they cannot go in front to have a walking motion.

"Struhadlo","2020-04-04T17:30:45.69Z","Serviceable, but little lazy ","<p>It does not happen too often that Lego makes a vehicle bigger than it actually is in the universe. The case is usually quite the opposite of that. Maybe they thought that the correct sizing of this vehicle would not fit the price tag. Well then they could have lower the price or make some other vehicle from the prequel trilogy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I generally do not understand why did they choose a Podracer from one the more hated scenes from the movies, or from a more hated movie in general for these 20th Anniversary sets, when they could have gone with a LAAT for example. The original trilogy got two fantastic vehicles why not the prequels? Who honestly cares about Scout Walkers? They are cool and all but could not Lego though of a more popular vehicle? Let&#39;s run a short test. I will name 5 vehicles I think are more popular than both&nbsp; <strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75258-1/Anakin-s-Podracer-%E2%80%93-20th-Anniversary-Edition"" target=""_blank"">75258</a>&nbsp;</strong>and this set without any googling. Jango Fett&#39;s Slave 1, Republic Gunship, AT-ET, Anakin&#39;s Interceptor, MTT.</p>

<p>I will not review nor base my rating on their choice of a vehicle to remake for these special sets, but the set itself since it is a decent set overall. So let&#39;s dive right into it.</p>

<p><strong>PRICING</strong></p>

<p>250 pieces for 30$ is alright with me. I would love to see few more B1 battle droids here but whatever. The price is fair and I have nothing to complaint about. Yet.</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Darth Vader. I will start with the collectable one first. The box says &quot;...an exact replica of the original LEGO Star Wars minifigure.&quot; So that was a God damn lie. First of all, there a humongous&nbsp;print that says 20 YEARS LEGO STAR WARS. Thankfully Vader comes with a huge cape to mask this, but why? It is on every single one of these 20th anniversary minifigs and it does not look good. I understand the need to distinguish these from the original ones, but why so damn huge? A small print on the back would be enough I feel like. Furthermore, the hilt of the lightsaber is not the chrome silver but a regular modern silver lightsaber hilt. And then the colours are little different. Anyway it is decent minifig and it surprisingly still holds up today. It has only a somewhat detailed print on the chest and a pretty detailed head in grey for the time period it originates from, but the mold for the helmet still looks decent. In conclusion, this is not an exact replica, but it is serviceable one and for many probably nearly identical.</li>
	<li>Wookiee warrior. This is a little different minifig for those who do not own one already as it has no head piece. Wookiee has some fur print on the legs and then no print on the body other than this one. Instead of head he comes with a mold that covers everything from waist to head. And the mold is quite neat I must say. The detailing is convincing enough and the face looks really good. There are some lighter shades of beige colour to help with the detailing. Wookiee is armed with an OG flintlock musket.</li>
	<li>Kashyyyk&nbsp;Clone Trooper. Yes, there are 3 Y in the name. A stellar minifig. The detailing of the camouflage on the armour is brilliant, the waist print connecting the torso and the leg print again excellent. There is even a pretty rich back printing here. No arm printing though. The head is a single expression angry clone one. As for the helmet I think you cannot really ask for more. The mold has a lot of small shaping done and the print is again beautiful. Overall a brilliant minifigure.</li>
	<li>B1 battle droid. A classic battle droid with no printing whatsoever. But honestly, it is not even in a need of one at all. I like these droids the way they are. One arm can hold stuff vertically and the other horizontally. There is also a hole on the back so you can put some stuff on the back.</li>
</ul>

<p>I have two gripes about this set&#39;s minifigs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why is there a regular battle droid instead of the Kashyyyk battle droid which is used in the set released in the SAME WAVE!? The set in question is a brilliant <strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75234-1/AT-AP-Walker"" target=""_blank"">75234</a></strong>. It has two of said battle droids why this set cannot have one too? I have no idea.</p>

<p>My other problem is lack of opposition. Putting one lonely B1 guy against this monster of a walker is not fair. There is the spider droid, but I think 2 battle droids would make the set look better. But that is not much of a dealbreaker.</p>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>The main build here is the walker. I think Lego has done a decent job putting together this fella. There are some nice details, some playability and the cockpit even has two handles of sort for weapons. The stickers are easy to apply unless you suffer from the Parkinson disease. And if you do, do not worry buddy. You surely have a loving family and everything will be fine (this was no sarcasm for a change). You can also pose the shields or winglets if you will around the cockpit area. All 5 of them. Putting the minifig into the seat is easy and with a little work you can put the handles into its hands.&nbsp;But..</p>

<p>The walker is just little bigger than it should be. It makes the two six by two&nbsp;plates at the front look too wide. It reminds me of the Frankenstein&#39;s Monster&#39;s forehead. And yes, the monster is not called Frankenstein, that is the doctor who created it. There are also problems with the legs. They have 3 joints and none of them allow you to pose the legs forward so there is no option to make the walker look like it is walking. You can pose the legs backwards in all 3 joints. The antenna gun at the front can rotate horizontally and not vertically which is strange considering this is an anti-personnel weapon. My last problem with walker and perhaps the biggest one is the colour theme. The grey and the beige are both alright. But why is there a sand green for the details and the military green which again is used for the detailing on the AT-AP walker in&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75234-1/AT-AP-Walker"" target=""_blank"">75234</a>&nbsp;</strong>set. I originally bought this set to add to the mentioned walker. But when you put these side by side they do not even look like they are from the same scene. Especially if you have seen the movie and you know the size difference. It is the same thing as with the battle droid. These continuity errors just drive me little nuts.</p>

<p>Continuity errors come from either stupidity or laziness. I do not belive Lego to be stupid. I think were just lazy here. Which is a shame since these two sets would go together pretty well considering they are both from the same battle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Spider droid looks good I would say. It has a stud shooter on the nose which some people hate and I do not mind. The legs are poseable&nbsp;and there is a transparent round two by two brick at the bottom to support the legs.</p>

<p>The trench barricade looks really good. The colour choice might be little strange since almost everything made by Wookiees is either from wood or metal, but it does not ruin the aesthetic of the set. And the rocky pieces used here are pretty cool.</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>You have 3 minifigs to play with so that is something. There are two stud shooters. One on the walker and one on the Spider droid. You can pose the legs on the walker, but only backwards as already mentioned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set definitely offers enough playability to be fun enough for kids and adults alike.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>Now I know I made it sound like I hate this set. But that is far from the truth. The problems I have with the whole thing&nbsp;are not major problems usually, it just takes more space to fully explain them. Beside some colour choices and the fact that the vehicle is too large, which does not hurt all that much, I think this is a pretty decent set. There is nothing amazing about it, but it is one of the classic average good sets.</p>

<p>I do recommend getting this set more for the play value than the displayability, unless you are head over heals with this vehicle.</p>
