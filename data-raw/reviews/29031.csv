"xboxtravis7992","2019-04-03T19:30:33.027Z","The Original Battlepack Returns for the 20th Anniversary","<p>So 11 years ago was when Lego first introduced the Star Wars battlepacks, and one of these was the now considered classic 7667-1 Imperial Dropship. Now in celebration of the theme&#39;s 20 year anniversary, Lego has re-made the classic set. Does this &#39;Special Edition&#39; hold up to the original with the additional $10 to the price tag?&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><em>Stormtroopers:&nbsp;</em>Every year Lego seems to introduce a new helmet that fans argue over. Iron Man, Ant-Man&#39;s original helmet, Darth Vader&#39;s updated helmet and the dual molded helmets for the Rebel pilots in last year&#39;s X-Wing. This year its Stormtroopers! Fortunately Lego has made sure that with this set along with a few other sets from earlier in this year, the new Stormtrooper helmet is easily available on the market right now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new helmet is actually pretty good looking with its crisp molding and prints. It is a loss that it can no longer rotate about the head to have the trooper looking in any direction other than forward... but I can&#39;t complain about the way it looks alongside&nbsp;the original Stormtrooper helmet. It may seem odd, but variance in Stormtrooper helmets is actually a realistic screen feature of the actual Star Wars films as the molds to form the plastic helmets gradually deformed after years of use during the original trilogy and had to be replaced and replicated again and again as the series went on. So having these new Stormtroopers aside ones released a year or two ago doesn&#39;t look to distracting, at least not as much as say... putting Rebel Pilots from last year&#39;s X-Wing side by side&nbsp;with pilots wearing the old style helmet. So no, don&#39;t panic and think you need to replace your entire Stomtrooper collection with the new helmet to try and make it look uniform, since the two helmet styles do blend together quite nicely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The head and body is the same as previous trooper&#39;s, with an &#39;Angry Clone&#39; head and identical torso and leg printing. Anyone wishing to update their troopers to the new helmet style just need the new helmet... and visa-versa anyone wishing to back date these troopers to the old helmet style just need said helmet (although as I stated, the variety is not that noticable in a large display set up).&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Shadow Trooper</em>: This is the third iteration of the Shadow Trooper look, and also uses the new helmet but this time in gunmetal gray and black molding. Unlike the white stormtroopers that blend in well with older Stormtrooper&#39;s, this new Shadow Trooper sticks out a bit compared to previous iterations due to coloring used, since the gunmetal gray highlights gives this one a much darker vibe than the figure from the original 2008 battlepack, and the primary black coloring of both the new and 2008 figure stick out compared to the gunmetal primary coloring from the Shadow Trooper battlepack from 2015. With that said, this is the most accurate of the three variants, closely matching the trooper&#39;s looks from most Legends and Canon sources. This is a cool figure, and I would be happy to see Lego sneak it into another set sometime in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>20th Anniversary Han Solo:&nbsp;</em>Yeah the nostalgic vibes are strong with this one, I have the original Han Solo from the first Millenium Falcon, but he got worn and abused when I was a kid and really is pretty beat up after several years of bouncing around a toy bin. So I am glad to have this modern day replica now as an adult. Is the 20th Anniversary printing on the back a bit obnoxious? Yeah. But I don&#39;t really view this figure much for the play value since the included stand really seems to indicate it should be seen as a collector&#39;s piece. While I don&#39;t have plans on buying all the 20th Anniversary sets, I got to admit the sleek black display stand and this retro figure really have me tempted to try and at least Bricklink the whole retro figure collection. The only major error on the figure is the yellow chest printing is not as opaque as it appears in the official set renders. Great to see the megaphone-blaster in use again to!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>I normally skip packaging and instructions in my reviews, but the retro-throwback box style and the information bits on the design of this set vs. the original in the instruction sheet are pretty neat. Check out the instruction manual on Lego&#39;s website if you want to see the information it covers regarding the design process if you can.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Yep, its 2008 again for the most part with the build. While this model is far more sturdy than the original, particularly with the updated build for the troop seats, it is still very similar to what we first saw in the original set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My only complaint is the stickers are a pain in this model. I normally don&#39;t have issues with stickers, but this one gave me trouble...&nbsp;They are all circular, and to my chagrin the alignment shown in the instructions (which I followed) ends up placing the Imperial insignia about 30 degrees off center from how it appears on the boxart (oops!). Its bad enough I am tempted to Bricklink&nbsp;replacement stickers and replacement parts to get the alignment &#39;just right&#39; since the instructions really throw it off. Note: After first writing this review I noticed the original 2008 model seems to have intentionally offset Imperial insignias, so um... accidentally genius homage?</p>

<p><strong>Finished Model</strong></p>

<p>Okay, the nostalgic vibes are strong. This speeder-dropship&nbsp;(headcanon, this is totally a low altitude speeder since it is not sealed up for spaceflight)&nbsp;looks and feels a lot like the 2008 original but the changes made are well chosen improvements. The darker blue color is far more sleek and gives it a nice official Imperial look the bright blue on the original lacked.&nbsp;The opening and closing flaps near the engines are a nice addition, and the cargo/seating sled is far sturdier than the original (although it looses one seating spot compared to the original, which is mostly fine considering it doesn&#39;t have more figures to ride there). The stormtroopers look far more natural in their new three seating arrangement than the original four seat design looked, and its easy to imagine the rear trooper functioning as a gunner to protect the aft end of the ship! The ease of dropping the trooper seats encourages the same MOC potential the original has, and I hope to see Lego fan&#39;s building custom cargo and weapon platforms to swap with the as built seating bay.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But is it worth the $10 price increase? If we consider that the Han Solo figure adds about $4 of value, the model isn&#39;t to far off the $15 &#39;standard&#39; battlepacks have been coming in at for the last few years. But those &#39;standard&#39; battlepacks have been very character specific recently, and as fun as it was to get Jedi, Bounty Hunters, Inferno Squad and Snoke&#39;s Guards in cheap sets... those aren&#39;t army builders... Stormtroopers are army builders though and I am really tempted to buy a handful more of copies of this set just to quickly stock up on the new trooper helmet design (even if it means ending up with a few spare Retro Han Solo&#39;s). But, at $20 I can&#39;t say I really want to buy multiples of this set. My recommendation is that this set is a must buy, but look for it on discount or use your VIP points to lower the price especially if you intend to buy more than one copy of the set to army build.</p>

<p>The nostalgic chord though has been well struck with this set, and if your a fan of the 2008 original this is a great re-make to acquire!&nbsp;</p>

"VerMonster","2019-04-07T18:32:18.543Z","Its good, but not the battlepack I'm craving","<p>Lets take it from bottom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dropship build. I want to be indifferent, but I find myself actually liking the design. That the troop bay is modular screams &quot;MOC ME&quot;, building cargo and gunship modules. I see this kind of like a Little Bird, or a Kiowa Warrior. This is a great starting place, and I&#39;m going to have a few of these so I&#39;ll be doing the MOCs. The trouble I have is that something like this platform is incompatible with the Tarkin Doctrine and doesn&#39;t feel like front line Imperial tech. But... don&#39;t care.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the real point to this is the minifigs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know people are kibbitzing about the helmets. But people hate every helmet for Stormtroopers for 20 years. It isn&#39;t easy trying to take a prop made to fit on a 6&#39; tall man and scale it down to fit a not quite one-thirtysixth the size. I think despite losing the ability to turn the helmet, this looks good. I think it&#39;s an honest and worthy attempt to recreate something so iconic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The use of the Shadowtrooper is a great addition. They are supposed to be a special missions unit, so it&#39;s a little odd to see one as a pilot here, but I can live with it. Given that I&#39;ll be buying several of these for the next few months I&quot;ll have a team or even squad&nbsp;of them</p>

<p>This is a good $15-16 battlepack. And then they add the jaundice version of Han. I honestly don&#39;t know if it is worth the extra four or five bucks. And I&#39;m going end up with a number of them. BUT, it&#39;s a good look, and can remove the 20th Anniversary logo from the back of the torso. That is what ruined it for me even as a Star Wars fan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, I said it wasn&#39;t the battlepack I&quot;m craving, so in all fairness I&quot;ll share what I want. I don&#39;t mind the $18-20 pricepoint, particularly for a licensed property. What I WANT to see for that value, though, is 4 Stormtroopers and a Scout with a minifig-scale&nbsp;speederbike about the size of the one in 75014. And if LEGO wanted to do something profitable, not all of them have the scout and the bike, some of the boxes would get two more Stormtroopers (one with an NCO&#39;s paldron) and an E-Web instead, or two Shadow or Death Troopers with jet packs, or... well, you get the idea. Set up half a dozen variations as blind boxes, put 12 in a case.</p>

<p>And I can survive at $20 for this, to. I know Target is charging MSRP for this, as is Amazon, I haven&#39;t seen a Walmart price. I do plan on getting four or five of these, and if they clearance them out for insanely low prices in six months or so... well.. I&#39;ll hurt my bank account.&nbsp;</p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2019-06-14T23:46:16.833Z","So this is what happens when you combine a Lego classic loved by many with modern building techniques. I'm thoroughly impressed with this","<p>To some, it may seem like I&#39;m not a huge fan of Lego Star Wars due to not having a lot of sets from this line. However, I am actually a huge fan of Lego Star Wars and I was thoroughly excited when they announced that Lego Star Wars would be celebrating it&#39;s 20 year anniversary this year. This was one of the sets I wanted the most, due to the interesting design and the fact that it was an upgrade to a already very popular Star Wars battlepack. Anyways, I suppose we shall examine this set at a closer angle</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</b>Once again, I must discuss the box because the box art is very superb for this line. While it lacks the CGI that was seen in the Overwatch sets, the box art is very unique, featuring&nbsp;a black background, a logo that surrounds the set, making it look complete, and an antique design of the old Lego Star Wars emblem that states the 20th Anniversary as well as displays the collectible figure in the set. The back is also somewhat unique, featuring all the collectible minifgures&nbsp;as well as provide some information on the original set. The instructions are also quite unique, telling a little story on how Lego Star Wars began, a comparison between the 2 different models and some more information on the minifgures, specifically highlighting the one included in the set and provided some info on the character.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong>This section will be very easy to discuss because even though there are 5 minifigures included, I really only need to discuss 3 because all the Stormtroopers are the same. So, I may as well Start with the Stormtrooper. Overall, I&#39;m very satisfied with the design. The torso and legs are well detailed. The &quot;Angry clone&quot; expression is innacurate, but I see why they do it and at this point, I don&#39;t care because it&#39;s basically a &quot;Lego meme.&quot; However, I am a little bit divided on the new helmets. From a design and display perspective, I absolutely love the super accurate detail they were able to accomplish. And while it does look bulky and may look out of place with older Stormtroopers, the helmet is still an accurate Stormtrooper helmet. From a play perspective though, it is really harder to move the helmets and even though it looked a little weird on the older ones, it was still a fun thing to do, to move the helmets around and look like the Stormtrooper was looking either right or left. You can&#39;t really do that with the new helmets though.... The Shadowtrooper is pretty similar to the Stormtrooper, featuring pretty much the same design, but in black. I do believe the update was very much welcomed by the commmunity and even I appreciate it, though he does suffer from the &quot;Angry Clone Head&quot; and the &quot;Bucket Helmet&quot; syndromes. Overall, a well designed figure though. Finally, we got the Special Anniversary Edition of the Classic Han Solo. Overall, I feel like this is a well designed figure to tribute the beginnings of Lego Star Wars. All the details of the older and simpler figure are still there, probably updated with modern prints. And, while this is a controversial opinion, I actually like the printing on the back of the figures because it separates this one as a collectible version from the older versions and doing people a service who have the older ones, so they don&#39;t lose value. Though, I can see why people don&#39;t like the printing. Overall, a solid set of minifigures</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong>The build was pretty easy for the most part, featuring some modest technic building as well as a few stickers. Honestly, nothing to complain about. Though, I will warn that one closely looks at the sticker sheet because it is easy to mess up the colors and then you won&#39;t have a fun time trying to fix that. Also, when you&#39;re attaching the technic beam to the troop carrier, make sure you attach it the right way because if you don&#39;t the assembly will wiggle around a lot, but who knows, maybe one wants that to feel more faithful to the older model.</p>

<p><strong>The Complete Model:&nbsp;</strong>Overall, the complete model looks very nice. This set includes a nice little place you can display Han Solo and a way to connect him to other figures if you have any. The ship is very well designed and improves a lot of the flaws and even upon the design of the older version. I especially like the use of the winglet pieces that were initially designed&nbsp;for Nexo Knights and they look marvelous here in Dark Blue. Also, the connection of the newer version is much stabler than that of the old one, something I didn&#39;t find out until reviewing this set, but maybe some people prefer the more loose design. Also there are places where the troopers can store their weapons. Also, the cockpit piece looks really sleek compared to the old one, even though they love to use it on helicopters in City a lot, I find it an acceptable usage, definitely better than the bulkier one. Finally, I&#39;m glad they fixed the issue that the previous one could sit 4 figures, despite the set only including 3 Stormtroopers and 1 ShadowTrooper. If I had the older one, I&#39;d certainly be boggled why they included seats for 4 figures, but only included 3. Overall, I think this has some much needed improvements to the older one.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Thoughts:&nbsp;</strong>For fans of Lego Star Wars, this entire wave is nice because they&#39;re remaking sets that fans may be nostalgic about or provide upgraded models to sets people may have wanted long ago but couldn&#39;t necessarily get. This set in particular was a good choice for me because it&#39;s a unique set that never appeared in any of the movies but the Lego community loved when it was first revealed and also one I never got initially. This set is definitely a decent set that includes 5 figures, 4 are good for army building, 1 is a collectible figure and I believe the 4 upgrades are decently desirable, especially with the new Shadow Trooper that was provided. For a battle pack, I do view the price as a little high, but I can understand it with the inclusion of an exclusive minifigure and a few parts to make the stand. Overall, I am satisfied with the set, I&#39;m glad this is a fairly cheap set to obtain, I like the fact there&#39;s a lot of minifigures in a small set and I&#39;m happy Lego even released a special wave to celebrate the 10 year anniversary for Lego Star Wars</p>

<p>Anyways, I hope you enjoyed reading this, I hope you were able to reach a reasonable conclusion and I will see you soon for more Lego reviews</p>

"BrickofFate","2019-12-31T08:38:08.037Z","20th anniversary battle pack","<p>The imperial dropship is one of the five sets (though there are a few more which are exclusive and hard to find) celebrating 20 years of lego star wars</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The box:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The box has a rectangular shape like the dual microfighter sets and not the normal size for a battle pack.The box has the beautiful 20th anniversary badges and theme which make the it look very good.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The instructions:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The instruction&#39;s first page is the same as the one in the other four sets,explaining how the star wars theme was created 20 years ago.After this is a comparison between the older version (from 2007,i believe) and the new one,paired with interesting facts about them.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The minifigures:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;There are five minifigs in this set,including 3 stormtroopers,1 shadow trooper and the 20th anniversary Han Solo minifigure.The new design for the stormtrooper helmet is discussed a lot amongst fans and reviewers.It better represents the helmet in the films which is a great thing even though i prefer the the previous version of it.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The build:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The build is simple,like the first edition of the vehicle&nbsp; but it is still fun to assemble.It looks kind of unfinished because there isn&#39;t any protection for the pilot except the glass infront.To be honest only a few buy this set for the vehicle only.Still,it is nostalgic to own one,and the set is great for building your army of stormtroopers.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Playfeatures:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; The main playfeature of the set is droping the back of the ship and deploying the stormtroopers into battle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Conclusion:</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The set is definitely an improvement to the last edition of the set,though the price is higher than it should be.</p>

<p>20th anniversary Han Solo is a nice edition to the set.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The build for the dropship is really cool and a very good remake of the original. I don&#39;t own the original, but I still like this set and I find the ship really fitting in the Star Wars universe, though we never see it, because it&#39;s not canon...</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Yes, the minifigures are fantastic. I personally love the new Stormtrooper design and the Shadow Trooper is a nice addition. I like Han Solo, but unfortunately his inclusion make this set not be a battle pack. Come on, LEGO, I don&#39;t want an&nbsp;army of Han Solos... Also, who cares about stud shooters? Does anyone enjoy them really?</p>

<p><strong>The Price</strong></p>

<p>This set is&nbsp;<strong>very</strong>&nbsp;expensive. My guess would be that Han Solo and the 20-Year Anniversary are what pumps up the price, but still, it is too much...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, I like this set, but it is not an army builder and it is too expensive...</p>
