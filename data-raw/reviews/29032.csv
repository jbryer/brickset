<p>The box has same length and width as, e.g. <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42025-1/"">42025</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42054-1/"">42054</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42066-1/"">42066</a> but 20 % more height. I would like to point out that it is smaller than the box of the<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42078-1/""> Mack (42078)</a>.</p>

<p>It is surprisingly heavy due to the fact that it is almost filled - in contrast to many other recent sets where you got only about 50% of the box&#39;s volume.<br />
However, the 550-page instruction book certainly has an impact.</p>

<h2>Built</h2>

<p>I spread the assembly over three evenings:</p>

<p>1. Car</p>

<p>2. Trailer (+ re-assembly of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42093-1/"">Corvette</a> for comparison)</p>

<p>3. Truck</p>

<p>I would estimate complete building time 6 to 7 hours.</p>

<p>I appreciate that there are no lengthy, complicated sequences on decorative elements. Set-up and mechanism of the trailer and truck are very similar but I never found it repetitive.</p>

<p>It would be considerable helpful if the &quot;2x&quot; notification would be printed <strong>at the beginning</strong> of such a building sequence where you have to assemble multiple subunits.</p>

<h2>The Model</h2>

<p>The truck is -really- big: Its width is comparable to <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8436-1/"">8436</a> or <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42009-1/"">42009</a> which means it it bigger than more recent trucks: You can easily place the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42078-1/"">Mack</a> truck on the upper deck.</p>

<p>All the decks and ramps are moving nicely and fit together very well. On <a href=""https://brickset.com/article/44899/review-42098-car-transporter"">Huw&#39;s review</a> I have asked if the chassis would appear &#39;open&#39;, &#39;empty&#39; because there are not that much panels or beams used. This is far less than I have expected. It is most prominent to me on the trailer. But this can be fixed (see below).<br />
Also, without stickers the front looks plain and boring.</p>

<p>I think the set designer has put a lot of effort in the technical functions and probably rated the overall appearance as secondary topic. This suit both this model and the whole technic line.</p>

<p>The car is also nice and does not need to hide from 42093:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42098/105_wr_31553.png"" style=""width: 640px; height: 305px;"" /></p>

<p>As with all recent technic model the turning cycle of both engines has a very big diameter. I always believe that this reduces playability.<br />
I have measured an outer diameter of 95 cm (23 &quot;) for the car which is 3.5 times the length of it. Not that realistic. I would like to see set designers to improve on this in the future.</p>

<p>There is a certain amount of modularity that will allow you to remove the upper transport decks without taking the whole model apart. Just work from end of the instruction backwards. It should be possible to add the white railings to the lower deck to prevent cars from falling down.</p>

<h2>Playing</h2>

<p>The aim of this set is likely to play with it plentiful options to drive the blue car over the various decks and ramps.<br />
Fun will be much higher if more cars are added to the play:</p>

<ul>
	<li>42093 Corvette</li>
	<li>42075 First Responder, will only fit on upper deck</li>
	<li>42079 Forklift, will only fit on upper deck</li>
</ul>

<p>However, I noted a couple of draw-backs when you add the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42093-1/"">Corvette</a>:</p>

<p>It cannot be placed on the lower deck of the trailer. It is a bit too long and therefore (typically) pushes the ramp to the truck down. It also barely fits the upper deck of the truck if the blue car is also placed there. This is owed to the fact that the bottom of the Corvette only has one point of attack for the yellow locks just behind the bumper bar.</p>

<p>Also, it cannot be driven onto the lower deck of the because the rear spoiler gets caught by the red support of the upper deck from the trailer.</p>

<h2>Rating</h2>

<p>This is a very nice set that has all what LEGO Technic is about (or should more often be...).</p>

<p>Currently I consider it as the best technic set of 2019 both for parts, playability and value-for-money.</p>
