"chefkaspa","2019-09-21T09:09:53.017Z","just a few (additional) remarks","<p>Huw has already described the set in <a href=""https://brickset.com/article/44805/review-42097-compact-crawler-crane"">his review</a>. There is only little that I would like to add as shown in the pictures:</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The picture shows content of the box compared to its size:</p>

<p><img alt=""content of box"" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42097/003_42097.png"" /></p>

<p>Bags are not numbered so I did a brief sorting:</p>

<p>To me it appears to be a good parts part. Yellow is the main colour with dark gray as second. Note that there are no special wheels for the tracks.</p>

<h3>Assembled Model</h3>

<p>The next pictures shows the assembled model in front of its box as reference for its size:</p>

<p>As far as I know, this would be the set with the most functions:<br />
Four supports with rotation (via small turntable), deployment (lever action), and extension (worm gear) independently on each of them.</p>

<p>The crane itself can be rotated (just a little more than 180&deg;, e.g. no full turn), raised (linear actuator), extended, and, of course, is equipped with a winch. The upper part folds in/out. The base can be raised and lowered by a lever. This function is not really obvious and I only noticed after writing the draft of this review...<br />
The construction of the arm is very similar to the one from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42082-1"">Rough Terrain Crane</a>.</p>

<p>Last function - because it is operated by a 12-tooth gear - is the control panel which is represented by a sticker on a 3x2 tile.</p>

<h3>Rating</h3>

<p>I cannot add much to the verdict of Huw&#39;s review with which I agree.</p>

<p>Even if you would not keep the crane assembled there are a few building &#39;tricks&#39; to pick up like the self-locking deployment of the supports or the very basic setup for gear rack.</p>

<p><strong>Is it worth buying?</strong></p>

<p>Consider that designers were able to create a model that has similar size of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42042-1/"">another recent crawler crane</a> using (ca.) 30% less parts (958 resp. 1401):</p>

<p>Deductions are noticeable in reduced lifting capability and stability.</p>

<p>I bought at 30% for rare(r) yellow parts in favour of sourcing parts from lego.com or Bricklink.</p>

<p>Colour cleanup</p>

<p>By replacing a few visible parts you&#39;ll get:</p>

"CPMoellering","2021-01-15T21:48:30.88Z","My First Technic Crane","<p>I had had my eye on this one for almost a year. I finally pulled the trigger with some money from Christmas just in time.</p>

<p>I did a little research because I didn&#39;t even know that these things exist in real life. A lot of them are designed to be able to fit through standard doorways I discovered at about 30&quot; wide. (~76cm). If we assume that is what this one is going for, we get a scale of about 1:4 which is huge for a LEGO set.</p>

<p>The build took me about 4 hours, with laying out all the parts first. None of the bags were numbered, so I just knolled out all 920 pieces before getting started. (Honestly, part of the fun.)</p>

<p>The directions were clear and I didn&#39;t have any issues while building. I chose not to use most of the decals because I have some MOC plans for this set in the future.</p>

<p>The undercarriage build was fine. I would have liked to see them add a couple of nobs to control&nbsp;the tracks. I mean why not, it wouldn&#39;t have added that much to the set in terms of parts. It seems the suspension for the tracks is a bit notional. The idler wheels don&#39;t engage the tracks, and there are only 2 sets of wheels for each track.</p>

<p>The outriggers and the boom all came together pretty easily. I enjoy the &quot;control&quot; one has with the finished model, giving it quite good playability. I am a bit disappointed with the capacity of the crane. I lifted about 300 grams (10.5 oz.) and I felt that was pushing the envelope of the boom. Considering cranes like this in real life can lift several times their own weight, I thought it could have been made a bit more robust in that regard. (The finished model weighs in at about 800 grams, or 28 oz)</p>

<p>This set is a first for me with several parts. The linear actuator seems to work well and I am looking forward to having that capability. The arm sections used on the outriggers are also new to me and I think they have some possibilities as well. The biggest new part for me is finally having&nbsp;a tracked vehicle. I have hungered after a tracked LEGO set for quite a while. Initially, I am a bit disappointed. They are just hard plastic, which I guess makes sense but isn&#39;t going to give any grip on a table-top or hardwood floor.</p>

<p>All that being said, it was a fun build and I&#39;m looking forward to the increased MOC capabilities I will have now with the new parts and lots of additional gears.</p>
