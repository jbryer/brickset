<p>First of all, the new 4x4 off-roader is a very nice looking Technic set and one of my first I have ever built.</p>

<p>I chose this set to buy, because I wanted to have a new experience&nbsp;in building LEGO - not only the standard creator expert sets or star wars, but something new for me.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that building Technic sets is a little different than typical LEGO sets. So I wanted to try and and the fun was great - even when I forgot to add an important part&nbsp;during the first steps and when I got to the end of bag 1 I realized that one small orange part was not used my me :(<br />
Unfortunately it had to be used and I spent the next half an hour to take apart most of that I already built.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beginners luck !</p>

<p>So after bag 2 and 3 and 3 hours of fun with my new LEGO set, I finally got my new 4x4 off-roader from LEGO and I had to try his capabilities despite it was 12 pm and a little cold on the covered porch, where I started to play with the new bricks.</p>

<p>My first experience during the construction are very positive - the car is not to small and not to big. The construction is stabile and I hope during my fun in the field it will not fall into pieces.</p>

<p>The colors&nbsp;are nice and even with the stickers it looks fabulous. I&#39;m not a big fan of stickers and I don&#39;t understand why LEGO is so often using them, but as always it&#39;s surely a pirce&nbsp;problem.</p>

<p>But I have also some negative reviews of the car :</p>

<p>1) price ! 230 EUR is to much for only ~1000 pieces - I benefit of a 25% discount at Selgros and that&#39;s why I bought the car so fast - if it wasn&#39;t the case, I would wait for a sale at the LEGO shop</p>

<p>2) the car is not so fast as I hoped - I thought that with two engines the car would be much faster and the tyres would have more power to drive up on bigger barriers, but after all it&#39;s &quot;only&quot; a plastic toy</p>

<p>3) to MUCH stickers my dear LEGO !</p>

<p>So - after all I don&#39;t regret my purchase and I&#39;m waiting for my 8 year son to be back from his holidays&nbsp;to play with this off-roader in the field, and I hope the fun we will have&nbsp;together is worth the money.</p>

<p>This review is not a complete one, I just want to add something to what Djhaggy said (who by the way did an excellent review, I confirm all what he said).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Construction was very pleasant, the design and mechanics are fabulous. I was amazed by this rotating front chassis that brings an enormous benifit to the overall suspension and clearance of the model. It&#39;s really an extreme off-roader in this sense. However, it&#39;s quite heavy (only 1000 pieces but 2 XL motors, one L motor and a battery box makes it overall heavy). You might say that it&#39;s no problem because it got muscles! Well, not so much actually. The speed is correct but the power doesn&#39;t meet the expectations. On a shallow climb, it slows down, and stops on steeper climbs. You can easily solve this problem (by inversing two gears at the rear end), but as you know, torque is at the cost of speed, and it&#39;s damn slow! Maybe adding a second XL motor to the rear drivetrain would help, there is space left (it&#39;s a pick-up!), but I didn&#39;t try yet.</p>

<p>I also don&#39;t like very much the remote control via an App, it&#39;s not the same feeling as a physical controller. The set would have been great with a new controller with progressive steering abilities. Without that, it&#39;s just too expensive!&nbsp;</p>

2. The build was fine, nothing difficult to put together. 8 million stickers though, I didn&#39;t put any of them on, seemed to tedious.<br />
3. It has 3 motors, yes! But no, the vehicle is super slow. It drives terribly slow on hardwood floor, get to carpet, its despicable.&nbsp; My Batmobile powerup!&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/app-controlled-batmobile-76112"" rel=""nofollow noopener"" target=""_blank"">https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/app-controlled-batmobile-76112</a>&nbsp;drives circles around this thing. I changed batteries 3 times thinking maybe I had bad batteries because it was so slow.<br />
4. Having to use my phone to drive it is horrible.&nbsp; The &#39;joy sticks&#39; are so small, my fingers kept losing the sticks and the car would drive erratic. Worse is, it has the forward/back on the right side and steering on the left. Anyone that has owned an R/C vehicle knows that is the opposite of a real remote and there is nothing in the options that I can find to flip the controls.<br />
5. After installing batteries, it took over 10 mins before I could even drive the stupid thing.&nbsp; I had to download the app, then I had to pair it, then I had to wait for updates and finally could drive the truck.&nbsp;<br />
6. I tried to write a review on this set on Lego.com, but it keeps giving me an error message that I cannot leave a review unless I am logged in, which I am! It&#39;s like they can sense I was going to leave a bad review.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps anyone else thinking about this set.</p>
