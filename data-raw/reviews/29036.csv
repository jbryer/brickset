<p><strong>Set 21046: Empire State Building</strong>, just released, could well be considered one of the best Architecture sets structures of the past few years, and IMHO is a candidate of best Architecture set of the whole series - buildings, scenes and skylines.&nbsp;This is the third rendition of the Empire State Building, the first dating back to 2009 (<strong>set 21002</strong>) and the second as part of the<strong> New York City</strong> skyline (<strong>set 21028</strong>). It is also by far the biggest, most detailed and the best. Building it was actually more fun than I had thought to be. The general character of the building itself as well as the necessity of applying 648 1x2 grilles could make for an extremely boring and tedious build, but the designer has made sure to avoid it as much as possible, IMHO. There are also a lot of clever techniques used, and the end result is actually very impressive.</p>

<p>IMHO this set is good value for money, even if somewhat expensive.(as all Architecture sets are). In price per part the RRP is actually excellent, and IMHO when looking at the final result (like Jangbrick&#39;s &#39;volume of stuff&#39; metric) it IMHO is still good value. Overall, this is a set definitely worth saving for.</p>

<h2>Building the Empire State Building</h2>

<p>As with all Architecture sets, one starts out with the construction of the base, where the yellow cabs (same scale as in the 2nd <strong>Guggenheim Museum (set 21035)</strong>) are already put in. The construction of the base floors sets the tone for the rest of the build: lots of studs-on-the-side, SNOT and side-ways construction. The core elements are quite colourful (red, yellow, blue, white), but in the end of course covered up by the 1x2 grilles.&nbsp;The most prized parts will probably be the silvered bricks (1x2 tiles,&nbsp;1x2 curved slopes and 1x2 grilled slopes). There is no use of Technic elements, yet the final structure is remarkably stiff and rigid; very well done by the designer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At no point I felt the construction becoming very tedious, which is a testament to the skill of the designer. Of course there is some repetition involved. However, the construction sequence makes for quite a bit of variation, as various parts get built at various times.</p>

<p>The construction is also a great way&nbsp;to discover construction techniques that allow for 1/2 or 1/3 brick offsets to create the &#39;layer&#39; effect of the real building. When finished, the looks on the outside are deceiving, they hide a lot of very clever construction underneath. Overall, the look and feel of the Empire State Building are captured very well. The grilles as well as the side-ways construction result in the facades and roofs not becoming plain and bland.&nbsp;In that regard, this set is a definite highlight in the Architecture line-up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>As with all architecture sets, this is a clear display piece. Even if, considering its size and weight, it could conceivably be used as a substitute for the candelabra in the murder detective game Clue.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>This set is IMHO an absolute highlight in the Lego Architecture line-up, and is a viable candidate for best Architecture set to date. The build is fun, and actually quite quick for a total of 1750+ pieces. This set could even appeal to&nbsp;those not normally interested in&nbsp;Architecture&nbsp;sets.&nbsp;The construction techniques used are very clever and could easily be used in other projects. The price is quite good as well, especially when compared with other Architecture sets. Some people talk about sets being a day-one purchase, and sets living up to the hype. IMHO this set definitely is a day-one purchase, and definitely lives up to the hype.</p>

<p>Was impressed at how many 2x1 grate plates there were (I think about 680, which is insane). The building techniques were very creative, and they even used some illegal ones, which I guess means that it isn&#39;t anymore.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In short, would 100% recommend to any afol, regardless of their liking of architecture</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>(Also gave it a 5 playability because the brilliant techniques used in constructing it, make it stupidly stable.. buuuuut the very top can fall off quite easily so be careful)</p>

<p>When someone first thinks of New York City, the first image that arises is the Empire State Building. The epitome of structural significance in this bustling metropolis delivers on all angles. Though I have never been to New York myself, I am still amazed by all this city has to offer, regarding the magnificent buildings. People flock to this city to be amazed by the beautiful skyscrapers that surround them. When I first bared witness to this set, I was blown away at the detail that the architects put into the model. This model was purchased as a way for me to branch off into Lego Architecture and now it has engulfed my curiosity into this theme of Lego. I wanted to fly to the city just to make sure they got every detail they could correct.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What I enjoyed about the set:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The building techniques used in this model were superb and kept me intrigued the entire way. The designers for this model did many outrageous modules for each section of this behemoth of a skyscraper, including placing a 4x2 tile in the horizontal on a 4x2 skinny studded brick, something I had never seen before. It was weird to build in this manner, but it provided exceptional support for this very tall model. There were 684 beige grate pieces used for the model to get the iconic color of the Empire State Building, which was nearly perfect.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>&nbsp;The instruction booklet was actually very interesting to read while building the model. Typical Lego builders do not take the time to read the fine print or details thrown about in the instruction booklet. Yet this model made you feel much more engaged with constructing this immaculate building. The interesting caveats, such as the escalators and elevators that are built in the model made the process even more amusing. The facts about the model also made the builder appreciate the cultural significance of a building that many may never see in their lifetime.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What I disliked about the set:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The only qualm I have about the set is the repetitive nature of the building process. Even though it expedited the building exponentially, I felt very dissatisfied with how quick it took. It took me roughly two hours to build the model and I felt disconnected at times from the building. There were some points where I got bored while building, which rarely happens when building a Lego set.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Would I recommend this model?</strong></h2>

<p>The largest Architecture set since the Robbie House did not disappoint. Even though the building process may be too repetitive at times, every detail during that process was incredible. I felt entranced in the beauty of the model when it was constructed and was very proud to display the model in my house. It may be mini-scale compared to its real-life representation, but this does model does enough for the future architects of the world to go out and build more impressive structures. This should be on everyone&#39;s Christmas list this year and for future lists.&nbsp;</p>

"StarKiller22515","2022-03-14T17:01:04.43Z","The Empire State Building","<p>This is a great display piece that has some unique and interesting building techniques, but having to put on 684 tan 1x2 grill pieces, a lot of which do not connect to 2 studs, so you have to line them up once you are done, but they spread those out, so it&#39;s not so tedious. There are tiny details that you would not know existed unless you built the set (or read this review), like how on the fist floor there are escalators built in to take up to the second and third floors. There is also an observation platform at the top as well. Overall this is a very cool display set.</p>

"George_W_S","2020-04-27T16:35:35.453Z","That's tan","<p>An overall amazing masterpiece. This set captures the iconicity of the Empire State Building beautifully. I bought this for &pound;65 which was worth it!!!!!!</p>

<p>Anyway. This was my first architecture set, and I am thoroughly happy. I love America and thought this was big, cool, greatly priced and instantly iconic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros: Being 55cm it makes a presence in a room. Although many people may call it&#39;s colour scheme &#39;bland&#39;,&nbsp;it&#39;s simply being accurate and that&#39;s all. I especially love the mini taxis at the bottom, the streets with crossings and the windows all surrounding the grandeur of the building. It&#39;s sleek and you can tell how the designer wanted to add more fun throughout the building experience with an overall basic build. Inclusions such as the red, white and blue bricks used for the inside of the building and the escalators on the bottom of the build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons: Nothing</p>

<p>I can&#39;t think of negatives on this build as it is simply perfect and I can&#39;t improve it in any way. It is completely personal preference if you should buy this&nbsp;</p>

<p>Honestly, I don&#39;t know what else I can say.</p>

<p>Accurate. Magnificent. A great build. And a 10/10 value for money.</p>

<p>What more could you want from this set???!?!?!?!?!?</p>
