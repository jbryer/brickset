I can safely say that this has got to be one of my favorite Architecture sets that I&#39;ve built (I haven&#39;t built too many, but still...). Lots of different building techniques were used in&nbsp;this massive set, and the little doors in the back allowing access to the paintings in the National Gallery is a nice&nbsp;touch.&nbsp;The Routemasters&nbsp;and Black Cabs returning from the Buckingham Palace set helps this set fit in with the other London sets.&nbsp;They even put&nbsp;blank spaces where there are elevators... ahem,&nbsp;I mean lifts, in the real space, something that went unnoticed by my parents when trying to get a stroller down to where the fountains are; good job designers!</p>
