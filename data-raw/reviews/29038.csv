<p>After catching fire for this whole Space Port/Mars Exploration-series with the three small-to-medium sets, I set my sight on the two larger sets of the series. Unfortunately, the special 60229 set does not yet see any discounts, so I focused on this one. I got it on quite the sale, which I&#39;ll come to later. Al I can say now is that this set was a surprise, but a good one! Judging by the past &quot;Adventure&quot;-series (Volcano, Jungle, Arctic), the largest &quot;regular&quot;-set used to fall somewhat behind the expectations, especially when compared to the &quot;special&quot; large set. But this series proved me wrong!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This is one set with quite unique parts! Obviously, the rails for the transportation system are quite an eye-catcher. I only knew them from the rollercoaster-sets and it is good to see that they find use in even more places.<br />
Also, the rocket itself has some large compartment-like parts which, of course, reduce the overall number of parts needed, but are great as a storage and for MOCs such as trains, ships or huge rocket boosters.<br />
Also, for a set this size, there were not that many stickers, which I appreciated. Oh, and a turquoise Brick Separator? What???</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Six minifigures are included in this set, which is a good amount for the size. Should not have been less. Again, the two genders are equally represented. We have a male and female technician/scientist, a male and female flight controller and a male and female astronaut. There is not much gear to the figures (camera, smartphone-thing, two tools), but that&#39;s OK to me, since the focus is on the rocket and the control center.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is not that complicated, but there are a few steps where you have to put a little more thoroughness to it. Due to the functions of the control center, it tends to swerve a bit while building. Also, the rails have stretch quite a bit, so enough space is required to build them.<br />
So nothing someone with a little experience can&#39;t handle, but very young builders might need some assistance.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s start with the obvious: When all is set up, this large set takes quite some space. The rails span over half a meter in diameter with nearly one meter in total length. The two small carts move smoothly across the rails most of the time.<br />
The control center stands at nearly 20 cm in height and 15 cm in width (without the stairs). It has a large detachable glass front for easy access to the minifigures. The control center features two work stations with computers and monitors and two large screens in the back, showing all kinds of information for the space travel. These screens each have a special function. One has a rotating display to show the trajectory of the capsule and the satellite. The other one has a countdown-function with &quot;moving&quot; letters 3 to 0. Also, the back of the control center can be opened completely for an even easier access.<br />
The rocket, when set up on the launch pad, measures nearly 50 cm in height. The colour scheme might seem a little odd with all the brown parts, but it turns out to be quite realistic, compared to the NASA spacecrafts. Other than these, this rocket has a real cockpit which fits two astronauts. The middle part has a cargo area for the space telescope. The last section is for propulsion, as it holds the main thrusters and the two boosters. It also has some kind of cargo-area, but this has no use whatsoever. The launchpad itself has a &quot;take-off&quot;-function, with the two support towers falling to the sides at liftoff.<br />
Additionally, there is a piece of ground with the mandatory crystal rocks and a &quot;holo&quot;-sticker. A small robo-rover with a deciphering-tablet and a larger, man-operated rover with a claw-arm complete the set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As I mentioned in the introduction, my expectations for this set were not really that high, but what a surprise! It turned out to be a very cool and fun set in what is an overall good series. Again, the biggest plus of this set is its playability. There is so much to discover, to move, to open, to place, to remove to push... my two girls already love this set and I already have to hide it, so that I can spend some time with it! ;-D<br />
The best part, for me, is the control center. Nicely designed, so many functions (the countdown is just too cool!!!), cool to look at and even cooler to play with. The mechanisms that hold the glass front and the two separate parts, which can be opened, are innovative! There are parts in that mechanisms, that I would&#39;ve never guessed can be used that way! You&#39;ll have to experience it yourselves!<br />
The rocket has a simple design to it, yet looks realistic and powerful. The cockpit persuades me even more than the one of the 2015 Millenium Falcon, both having similarities in design. However, the cockpit of this rocket can be closed almost completely, while the Falcon&#39;s still has quite a gap in it.<br />
The rails and the additional stuff support the very high playability of this set. I still could spend hours pushing these little carts over the rails! Good fun, indeed!<br />
What holds this set from getting full five stars is, once again, the waste of space and opportunities. There are several places in this set where something seems to be... missing in an odd way. Underneath the control center: Big empty space. The Lower part of the rocket: Big empty space. Why not put something there? Stinginess? Laziness? Who can say...</p>

<p>But all in all this is still a very good set. I got it for 75&euro;, which I think is OK for a large set which can be good for some nice displaying (AFOL) or hours of fun playing (actual target audience)!</p>

"charlesh555","2020-07-28T19:35:11.72Z","A classic space experience","<p>As this set is currently available for a price some way under RRP at various retailers, we decided to buy this as a summer holidays build project. My 7 year old was greatly impressed, as was I. He has inherited my classic space sets that I built at his age, and is a massive Lego fan. This set is considerably larger than any of those, but has some simple ingredients which make it work:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Interesting build, with little repetition.</li>
	<li>A range of different play features.</li>
	<li>Solid construction, including swooshability for the rocket.</li>
</ul>

<p>We took turns with the build steps in the instructions, which were easy to follow. The build process is nicely sequenced so the smaller elements of the set can be played with while the build of the larger elements continues.</p>

<p>One interesting build feature is a sliding mechanism in the control center as part of a countdown display on the large screen. The introduction of a rubber grommet provided an &quot;ah&quot; moment when we saw how the light resistance it provides means the slider has four distinct positions to give the 3...2...1... blast off countdown.</p>

<p>The set is inspired by NASA and this is no bad thing. We felt that the storage cavity in the lower part of the main rocket was a little out of step with reality though. The satellite isn&#39;t meant to fit there, and any stowaway astronaut may come to a grisly end as that piece burns up in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The highlight for my son was the short train track which delivers the two astronauts from the control center to the launch pad. The way the vertical supports peel away from the rocket was also good.</p>

<p>As an adult I was pleased that there weren&#39;t too many stickers. This modern space theme is excellent in my opinion, and even with no Benny, every bit as good as the classic space theme.</p>

"Itellyounothing","2019-08-28T12:36:43.287Z","City Space Port!!!! Whose seen the Martian?","<p>First of all full disclosure, I am a huge Lego Space fan. So I am predisposed to love anything they do.</p>

<p>This theme, this set appeals to me no end.</p>

<p>The build was fun. Especially the modular nature of the Rocket. If you have some&nbsp;of the other models in this theme, you will be able to make some awesome creations.&nbsp;60229 and 60227 come to immediate mind.</p>

<p>Parts, some great parts come with this set. I really like the astronaut rollercoaster. Many opportunities for that. I am also a fan of the big blue transparencies and the brown / orange tiles to give the rocket a cylindrical look. The crystal rocks are fun too.</p>

<p>Playability, the cargo spaces on the rocket, the little geological sampler and crystal, the mission control and the launch platform all give huge opportunities for imagination. In someways the set actually appears to be two. One for launching the huge rocket and getting a satellite into orbit and another for searching Mars for it&#39;s secrets.</p>

<p>Value for money...... I think this is a very cool set, but the second hand value seems far more reasonable (yes I get they always will)..... I feel like this home grown pile of awesome bricks is helping Lego meet licensing fees on other failing lines and that seems to be a shame. Maybe it&#39;s time to ditch a certain money sink Lego. That said there are some big parts in this set!</p>

<p>I still give it a five. Hurrah for Lego Spaceport!</p>

"CPMoellering","2020-12-19T22:54:39.533Z","Close, but short in a few areas","<p>Received this set for Christmas (You know you&#39;ve done your job well as an AFOL when your adult kids gift you LEGO for Christmas!)</p>

<p>The build was straightforward and took me a leisurely&nbsp;three hours. The sequence of the build was logical and arrived at finished pieces for each sub-build.Each sub-assembly&#39;s has a corresponding parts bag and instruction book. I would prefer a consolidated book, but this way it is possible to parcel out building tasks to multiple builders if you desire.</p>

<p>The launch control room is great. The full-wall display with the countdown timer and moving display are cool and the removable glass wall provide easy access for play. The ability to slide my iPhone in after loading the app t have an animated display is also a very cool touch. However, I do think the gimmicking of it limits it re-use in other builds.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The roller-coaster-esque transport feels a little hokey to me, but is forgivable. If it had remained elevated the whole way it would have seemed more realistic to my mind.</p>

<p>The rover and the utility truck thing felt like they were cobbled together out of extra parts and don&#39;t really fit the launch control scene. I get the rover goes with the tiny chunk of Martian turf, but again, it feels like an extra.&nbsp;The utility truck is okay, but I&#39;m not sure if it belongs on earth or on Mars. The actuated arm and claw aren&#39;t bad, but there isn&#39;t anything for them to do.</p>

<p>The centrepiece of the build, of course, is the rocket. It&#39;s decent sized and overall I like it. My main criticism is the designer seemed to try to combine a shuttle and a rocket in one vehicle, since we have cargo bays in the main rocket motor. Not only that, but the bay&nbsp;doors are not hinged, which, to me, really impinges&nbsp;the playability in &quot;shuttle mode.&quot;</p>

<p>The command capsule is big, though I pity the astronauts who have to spoon all the way to Mars.... And, here again, I would have liked to see some sort of hinged door.</p>

<p>As another reviewer stated, that lack of a gantry by which to get the astronauts to the capsule also feels like an oversight. I made my own with parts out of my collection.</p>

<p>I think the various rocket pieces will get use in MOCs as well as the tri-girder pieces that are used a few places in this set.&nbsp; Not sure I would have bought this one on my own, but I&#39;m not sorry to have it in my collection.</p>
