"Sobel","2019-06-29T18:34:14.35Z","Nice looks, but not much more - just like many people today! ;-D","<p>I bought this set together with the Mars Rover and the Lunar Station, because they were on a good discount just one day after release. As mentioned before, I am a huge fan of everything space when it comes to LEGO, so this whole series is a must-have for me. So while this set looks quite good, it offers but much beyond the looks. But everything in order:</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts are absolutely standard for a plane/shuttle-type model. Only ones to stand out the crystal rocks, the holographic-thing beneath the rocks and the rover. Oh, and for a set this size, there are not that many stickers, which I appreciate.</p>

<h3><br />
Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are two minifigures in this set, which I personally think is a bit cheap. We have a male pilot with a light space suit and a female astronaut with a heavy suit for outer-space missions. There&#39;s no additional gear for the minifigures, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary.</p>

<h3><br />
The build</h3>

<p>Both rover and shuttle are very simple, yet robust constructions. The build is simple, should be done in 25 minutes max without hurry.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><br />
The completed model</h3>

<p>To me, the additional part of the set stole the show: the rover is a small, yet very versatile vehicle with a realistic design and lots of functions. The claw-arm moves freely in every direction, can grip the crystal rocks and looks very cool. It also features a laser which is quite mobile, too. Furthermore, it has a movable solar panel and a place to store the small scout drone in the back. The drone itself features a &quot;holographic display&quot; which has no real purpose but to make a sticker look different (just like in the old Exploriens series from the late 90&#39;s)</p>

<p>The shuttle is medium-sized, with an aerodynamic design, landing gear and a big hatch in the middle. Unfortunately, opening the hatch is all you can do with it. The cargo area has room for one astronaut and the rocket-boosted sample container. The cockpit can&#39;t be opened unless you detach the whole &quot;glass&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another additional part is a small rock-thingy with two Crystal-Rocks and some sort of cryptic image you need the drone to decipher.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><br />
Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Judging from the pictures I saw and the box design, I didn&#39;t have too many expectations on this set. And I was right this time. Like I stated in the title, the shuttle looks quite cool and has some play value, but that is all. Cool design isn&#39;t everything! The shuttle itself has NO functions other than opening the hatch. Ok, placing the container in the cargo area, of you wish so. And both minifigures fit in. But nothing else. No hinges to open the cockpit, no sort of claw-arm to grab the container...&nbsp; Let&#39;s be honest: the whole thing is just an enlarged version of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60078-1/Utility-Shuttle"">2015 60078 Utility Shuttle</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The small rover is a huge plus for this set, saving it from getting only two stars. It is versatile, has quite some functions and good looks. Feels like a mini version of the 60225 Mars Exploration Rover to me.</p>

<p>The small rock thing? Why??? Why did it have to be SO DAMN SMALL???? This is going to get lost so easily... Was it too much to use a 4x4 plate and add one or two more &quot;rock&quot;-bricks??</p>

<p>Also, one more minifigure would have been a good idea for this set. Maybe a second outer-space geared astronaut to go with the rover.&nbsp; But then again, male or female? Male one -&gt; riots from the feminists. Female one -&gt; both have to wear the same space-suit -&gt; envy! ;-P</p>

"OscarDelta","2019-08-19T21:43:22.59Z","Fascinating look at two future Mars missions","<p>I bought this because I wanted an unlicensed spaceship set, but I found that it inspired me to research the real-life Mars missions this set is based on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A little bit of background: Mars 2020 is a mission to deliver a new, updated rover to Mars. This time, the rover will be accompanied by a helicopter drone that will be able to scout the area around the rover to help plan routes and avoid hazards. One of the new abilities of this rover is obtaining core samples. The plan is deposit these core samples at predetermined locations for transport back to Earth during a later mission.</p>

<p>Now back to this set: it includes the rover and the helicopter drone (Mars 2020) and it includes a core sample retrieval drone and manned space shuttle (future missions).</p>

<p>I find the four-color scheme of white, black, orange and blue to be appealing. It inspired me to make my own MOC of a Mars passenger rover with the same color scheme.</p>

<p>The rover is pretty decent. The grabber claw works well with that rubber band. The laser is based on the laser used by the current rover to drill small holes in rocks to observe the gas that escapes. The solar panel seems a little small but that&#39;s ok.</p>

<p>The helicopter drone is a good companion to the rover; I can imagine that the gold cone are it&#39;s optics and because the drone is built upside down, I like to stick it underneath one of the shuttle wings for storage.</p>

<p>The core retrieval drone looks fine. The rock samples fit perfectly inside.</p>

<p>I like the proportions of the shuttle; it&#39;s pretty sturdy. Enough been said about the printing issues on the removable canopy; I&#39;ll just say: it doesn&#39;t bother me.</p>

<p>Overall, I found this set to be well worth my time and the potential for education (especially for young children already interested in space) is substantial.</p>

"Japanbuilder","2019-10-23T01:22:34.1Z","Great for play and flight! ","<p>We are on a roll here with these Space sets from LEGO in 2019. So far they have been offering up a nice variety of sets from small massable craft to satellites to rovers. Today we go up a notch to a medium sized set: Mars Research Shuttle. Let&#39;s dive in!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Packaging:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Very much the norm by now we get a nice pack with the shuttle flying above the martian surface with the rest of the builds in the set on the ground running assists. It is a bit surreal looking but as always imagination is key. On the corner an actual concept image from a real drone in development now at NASA. A nice touch in my opinion in bringing space exploration to life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside we get a few bags and a sticker sheet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Build and Parts:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build was very simple as to be expected in the City line from LEGO and some very large pieces were included, namely the wedge plates for the wings and the rear tail stabilizers. The canopy piece is also very large, however, it has a nicely detailed print on it. The downside to it being the white on it not matching the white of the rest of the set. This has been a real sore spot in this line thus far. I hope LEGO gets it together soon and gives us prints that match what they show us on the box. Aside from that the new astronaut helmet mold is exquisite. Dual molded and fitting a recolored visor piece that prevents the old up and down swivel but just adds to its cred as inspired by suits currently in development. It is a nice selection.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Minifigures:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the size of the set we only get 2 minifigures here. One male and one female, but as has been the case thus far they have nice prints on the torso and legs. The orange suited one is my favorite still in the wave with its mesh printing and silver detailing along with the cool space logo blending into the overall printing.We also get some decent faces for this set as well just as in the previous set 60225. These are welcome and will bulk up your space personnel nicely.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Completed Model:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed model comes with several components, the smallest being the drone, the rock formation and the cargo drone. The cargo drone gets thrusters and suggests it will carry any collected sample material to and from the shuttle. The drone comes with a book piece which has a nice print that interacts with the rock formation. The rock formation comes with 2 Geode pieces and a stickered tile that the drone&#39;s book piece can filter the reds out of to reveal some mineral compounds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next biggest assembly is the rover. It comes with a solar array panel applied via sticker that provides the unit with power. It also has a laser drill to help it dig up rock samples. This laser assembly is on a ball joint and it works well. The claw-arm gets 2 ball joints and can move about very, very well on those. It can even be tucked in rearwards to make the unit that much more compact. While lacking in the range of the larger rover in set 60225 this one has the same claw mechanism and works just as well if not better than its bigger brother at getting close in to the Geodes and scooping them up on its claw. The entire claw assembly can also rotate a full 365 degrees and this adds tons to its play value. It also looks adorable to my eyes with its six wheels and 4 front lights.</p>

<p>Lastly, the shuttle itself is a real looker. It has 2 spots for your crew members and even a maintenance housing at the rear. That housing, however, is held together by ratchet joints and will give the craft a rickety feel at the rear. They wont fall off though it is just the give between notches on the joints that make that sound. They will hold their angle just fine. The detailing on the engines the cockpit and the cargo drone control deck are well thought out and the craft is highly swooshable. The cargo drone also gets a storage slot it fits into in the shuttle. The landing gear on this shuttle is very small but I rather like it as it preserves the sleek look of the model even in landed mode. I feel that bigger wheels would have made the set look less appealing and clunky in flight. The only eye sore is the cockpit print color which does not at all match the color of the other white bricks. This piece is also a bit smoky in texture and not as crisp as previous materials for canopies. Still the shuttle looks nice overall.</p>

<p><b>Overall:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Certainly a fun set. If you can nab it for under 30 or 25 USD then go for it. It is large and the inclusion of 2 astronauts with vital jobs to do will be fun for many children. The additional assemblies also mean multiple children can play with this one set and have a good time. The rover in particular was way more fun than I first thought it would be. Its nicely articulated laser cutter and claw arm just make that component of the set so good and fun.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are into space exploration or have little ones that are into science and technology then this set should hit all the right buttons.&nbsp;</p>
