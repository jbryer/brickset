"Sobel","2019-06-13T17:37:53.59Z","Nice and sturdy space-vehicle! Mars is SO gonna be explored...! ","<p>I have waited for quite some time now for a decent new space-themed series by LEGO. Since my beginnings, I collected LEGO space sets, preferably the sci-fi-like ones (e.g. Blacktron, Space Police etc.). Now finally, a completely space-based series, though not sci-fi but rather in the spirit of LEGO&#39;s recent NASA-sets (Saturn V, Lunar Lander)! For sure I am going to get my hand on all of those sets!<br />
Now let&#39;s take a look at the second smallest set to the series:<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The 202 parts of this set go almost completely to the rover itself. You get some gear - drill, remote-thingy, laptop, camera, solar panels -, nice wheels (combination of TECHNIC-wheels and the good old <a href=""https://rebrickable.com/parts/2593/wheel-hard-plastic-medium-35mm-d-x-31mm/"">2593 Hard Plastic Wheel</a>), the new crystal-rocks, which I liked very much and an OK amount of stickers.</p>

<h3><br />
Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are two minifigures in this set, which is sufficient for a set this size. We have a male driver for the rover, with a more detailed helmet than earlier space sets (no openable visor, though) and the classic oxygen tanks, and a female scientist/technician with a laptop.</p>

<h3><br />
The build</h3>

<p>Straightforward from top to bottom. There is really nothing special to it. Overly detailed instruction booklet, as with all sets these days... *rollseyes*</p>

<h3><br />
The completed model</h3>

<p>Yep, that&#39;s how a Mars rover can look like! Very sturdy, big wheels, high suspension. This thing looks like it could scale the Olympus Mons with ease. It has enough spotlights at the front to light its path, a container to store valuable samples and a very mobile crane that goes in almost every direction.<br />
The set is rounded by some pieces of gear to go with the technician or to fit in the cargo area of the rover. For a rather small set, it is quite something like a drill, a camera on a stand, the two pieces of crystal rock and more!<br />
I also like the colour scheme of orange/gold and white. It looks kinda efficient/retro and modern/futuristic at the same time.</p>

<h3><br />
Overall opinion</h3>

<p>A well-designed set with a very high playability, like most up-to-date sets. The rover, even though coming out smaller than I expected, has everything it needs for some Mars-exploration-action. The overall looks are flawless, the mobility of the new wheels is great - when pushed, it goes a very long way on a flat surface, the kids love it - and the gear it comes with is just right for a set this size.<br />
It has some good parts for MOCs, for example the wheels and the cockpit.<br />
On the downside, the cockpit is not to be opened in an elegant way. You can only remove the screen completely. Also the price of 20&euro; is quite a lot for a rather small, non-braded set. I got it for 17&euro;, which is OK.</p>

"Japanbuilder","2019-10-21T01:42:02.67Z","Immersive set just a few flaws. ","<p>Inspired by actual NASA rovers, at least as depicted on the box, we get a large manned Rover set for the&nbsp; 2019 Space wave. Let&#39;s see if the set lives up to expectations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Packaging:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like all the sets I have looked at so far in this series the front of the box depicts a basic scenario of the Rover being tested. As has been standard we also get a shot of a real life prototype rover being developed by NASA. I love that touch as it grounds much of the set in the real world and the LEGO version just lets the imagination run wild.&nbsp; It is a nice mix of reality and fantasy.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building experience was simple. The set is not expert-level to be sure given its pedigree and price but the early stages are really fun. At least for me the plate pieces being joined by technic beams and the ensuing warping is just interesting as the pieces have that slight tension on them. As the rest of the build comes together it all flattens out and it is as if it was all meant to work that way. We get a handy bit of fun pieces here as well. In particular, I liked how the sticker for the laptop piece really fleshes out that really old piece and gives purpose to the user. The modified stud with the bar protruding from it is also a nice piece to get and to get a spare of. The Geode pieces are my new favorite thing ever and I could never get enough of those.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Minifigures:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We get a pair of figures. One male and one female, both have nice printing on their suits but the astronaut figure steals the show completely. The orange suit and the mesh like detail along parts of it along with the hip and leg printing is great looking. That is uses the classic airtanks and comes in the new helmet molding is just icing on the cake.&nbsp; Happy to add them to the collection even though the face prints for either one are not that unique.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Completed Model:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed set I found to be quite cool looking. Though it is not without its flaws.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>What I liked:</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The overall design looks very polished. I liked the angled canopy piece and print and the large wheel design. I love that the crane can also be retracted and tucked neatly above the flatbed on the back of the vehicle. I like that we get several storage options on the vehicle itself one being the flatbed on the back an a lockbox type set up on the side of the vehicle as well. I also really like the fact that even though the claw on the crane has a rubber band to make it work, it actually feels mechanical in nature to me and it has enough &quot;bite&quot; to get at the Geodes. The crane arm itself is quite articulated and can reach both the flatbed and the storage box on the vehicle with ease. I liked that the solar array build can be hauled on the back and you can pretend it is also a power unit for the rover itself. The other items for testing the rover are fun as well allowing for thorough imaginative play of the rover and testing it or it just filming itself on the job in space, thanks to the included camera build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=""separator"" style=""text-align: center; clear: both;"">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i>What I did not like as much:</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I felt a bit disappointed by the print on the canopy not matching the white of the rest of the bricks. I also felt a bit bummed that those huge wheels were not rubber wheels and that no suspension was added to them in any way other than the natural flex of the technic pins that hold them. I also found the set bore little resemblance to the actual prototype being advertised on the box and again in the back of the final manual. Though that is a minor gripe really as it is all about imagination and the LEGO design just looks cooler. Also its size is a bit of a let down. It is much too big to be hauled to space by any of the space going vessels in this wave so it feels like you have to imagine that it would be hauled in parts into orbit then in parts again at a new planet and assembled on the surface of its final destination. But the biggest let down was that the vehicle has no comfortable way to accommodate a second figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was able to find this set for under the equivalent of $20USD and for that price this is actually very nice! It is large and robust and the crane arm and claw are fun to operate. If you can only get a few sets in this wave and are on a tight budget this would be a fun one to have. It looks nice and plays fairly well despite its limitations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are looking to get set 60226 then you might want to consider skipping this one as the rover included in that set, while not having as fun of a crane arm, will fulfill the role of this set quite well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>So while fun definitely not a must-have in the wave.&nbsp;</p>
