"iwybs","2019-07-08T02:31:10.233Z","Prelude to Invasion","<p>The moment I saw this set, I thought of 2011&#39;s Earth Defense HQ from the Alien Conquest theme (set 7066).&nbsp; That set contains a small fighter that is very similar in many ways - it uses the same canopy, nearly the same inverted 1x4 curved slopes underneath that canopy, nearly the same assembly of a wedge slope and a small tail behind the canopy, the same 3x10 wedge bricks to form the bulk of the fuselage, engines&nbsp;of similar diameter, and similar upturned wingtips.&nbsp; I wonder if, in real life, the two spaceships were made by the same set designer (Mark Stafford designed 7066), and I imagine that, in head canon, the two spaceships were designed by the same aerospace contractor; call it Stafford Space Works.&nbsp; The scenario runs something like this -&nbsp;</p>

<p>The successful exploration of Mars by astronauts from Lego City returned a wealth of incredible new knowledge to the scientists and citizens of the City, but their ventures beyond low Earth orbit also came to the attention of fierce, greedy aliens from beyond the fifth dimension .... before long, these creatures from outer space launched a full-scale invasion aimed at nothing less than the wholesale conquest of Lego City and the reduction of its citizens to liquid hors d&#39;oeuvres.&nbsp; Fortunately for the survival of Lego humankind, the bounty of scientific knowledge and engineering know-how that came from the Mars exploration program allowed them to quickly develop the small shuttles used for routine satellite maintenance into fearsome orbital interceptors.&nbsp; With these new fighters guarding the orbital approaches and heavily armed attack helicopters patrolling the skies, the Earth Defense Force eventually drove away the fleets of flying saucers and ushered in the Golden Age of Space Exploration.&nbsp; With the lessons learned from the alien invasion, there was no longer any need to visit Mars, for space colonies could be established far more easily on far more distant, yet hospitable planets.&nbsp; For many years the fleets of Lego Classic Space pushed through the unknown spaces of the galaxy and established trade routes between Earth and the farthest stars while Lego City grew into a thriving cosmopolis with citizens from all corners of the universe, but the peace was not to last.&nbsp; No sooner did an aggressive corporation break the longstanding taboo and return to mine the valuable Martian mineral deposits than a new, and even more fearsome, alien enemy arose.&nbsp; What happened next?&nbsp; Only you can tell, dear reader!</p>

<p>But seriously, this is a perfectly competent little spaceship.&nbsp; It&#39;s cheap and swooshable, which is all it needs to be.&nbsp; The cockpit is just large enough to accommodate the minifigure&nbsp;laying down with a spacesuit on, and the fuselage behind the cockpit contains an open space just large enough to accommodate the satellite, with its solar arrays folded.&nbsp; A couple of modified plates with clips serve as a partial tailgate just large enough to keep the satellite from coming out while you swoosh the ship.&nbsp; There&#39;s no obvious place to store the spanner, and it&#39;s a bit tricky to stash the spanner in the cockpit (with the minifigure) and still close the canopy all the way.&nbsp; The ship neatly combines wedge plates and wedge bricks to produce a pleasing planform that widens towards the back without suffering the severely straight lines of other small spaceships, like the 918, and the use of 2x2 triangle tiles neatly bridges the angles of the wedge bricks and the trailing edge of the wing.&nbsp; The engines and trailing edge use a neat technique: white automobile spoilers clip into modified plates on the wing, bar claws clip onto the center of the automobile spoiler attachment bar, and&nbsp;Black Brick, Round 2 x 2 Dome Bottom parts slot onto the bar claws.</p>

<p>With all that said, there&#39;s nothing really special about this ship to make it stand out from any other little Lego spaceship.&nbsp; Hence, it is neither bad (1) nor good (5) - just perfectly neutral, a mediocre 3 in overall rating, as well as with respect to the building experience, parts, and playability.&nbsp; At $10 USD for 84 parts that weigh 145&nbsp;grams, the price-per-part ratio isn&#39;t great and neither is the price-per-gram ratio, but they&#39;re acceptable for a $10 pocket-money set.&nbsp; It would be nice if the minifigure was one of the new orange-suited figures with dual-molded helmets and classic white airtanks, but there&#39;s nothing wrong with the use of the standard EVA helmet that&#39;s been used in City space sets since 2011.&nbsp; It&#39;s used for all City spacewalks, and this set is meant to evoke a spacewalk, so it&#39;s fine.</p>

<p>In conclusion, this set would make a fine present for any kid of the appropriate age, but apart from its place in my head canon there&#39;s nothing special about it.&nbsp; I hope you&#39;ve found this review useful, and I hope you have a nice day.</p>

"Sobel","2019-08-22T08:16:58.153Z","...but wait, there's more!","<p>I did not plan on buying this set in the first place, but when I decided to give me the treatment of the complete Mars-exploration series, of course this one had to be included. As the title states, this set might not look like much on first sight, but there&#39;s more to it!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Even though being a small set, we have quite some nice parts here. There is a cockpit-glass with a hinge, two small thruster-parts and solar-panel stickers. There are only four stickers in total which is nice!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Of course, there&#39;s only one minifigure which is a male astronaut with a standard face. It sports the new white-and-gold space-suit which I personally find very appealing. The astronaut has a wrench-like tool which seems a little chunky to work on something delicate like a satellite, but oh, well...</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>What do you expect from 84 parts? Easy, straightforward, can be done in 10 minutes. As always, the instruction booklet is WAAAAAYY to detailed... Waste of paper in my eyes...</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Here we have a handy and stylish little spacecraft with an aerodynamic design, movable cockpit-glass, built-on thrusters (other than with the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7695-1/MX-11-Astro-Fighter"">7695 Mars Mission set</a> with STICKER THRUSTERS) and a special minifigure. Also, there is a hatch in the back of the shuttle, which might not be obvious on first sight. The satellite fits in smoothly and can be secured by two small clamps. A little flaw: The wrench-thingy has no real place to be put so it falls around loosely in the cockpit.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>WYSIWYG... at least almost! While it may not look like much more than a standard small spacecraft, this set offers quite a little playability. I liked how the designers found a way to include some kind of cargo area in such a small set. This is quite outstanding in my eyes, there being no set of this size coming to my mind which has this type of cargo hold which fits a whole satellite.<br />
With a price of 7-10&euro;, this set makes a perfect gift for little adventurers and space enthusiasts! Maybe the start to a glorious collection of LEGO space themed sets...?</p>

"Japanbuilder","2019-10-17T00:51:12.877Z","So much sleekness in such a little box! ","<p>Whenever LEGO releases a Space wave we get little spaceships for entry prices that are meant to be massable and come with at least one little astronaut to fill up your space exploring forces. Set 60224 for 2019 is all of this a bit more. Let&#39;s dive in to see why.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Packaging:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This package is actually quite nice. Similar to the polybag set 30365 for 2019 we get a full image of the product within and a picture of an actual astronaut in the corner. It really lights the imagination on fire seeing a set representing or building upon an actual thing that exists.</p>

<p><b>The Build and Parts:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is very simple and should not pose a challenge for anyone in the intended age group. The parts are also quite nice and fairly large considering the the price of the package. We get the angled plates to form the wings which are pretty big as well as the large sloping pieces that make up a large part of the body of the craft. The canopy piece is also very large but unlike previous pieces in this style the material here is a bit cloudy and prone to smudge and scratch quite easily. Another thing of note to me is that this wave has a lot of 1x1 studs of both solid colors and translucent colors with this white dot right smack in the center of the stud. Like the piece was removed from a modelling sprue or mold case prematurely and a bit of excess material was left behind. Very sad about that as it diminishes the usefulness of pieces. I mean that dot looks like a blemish and breaks the color consistency.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here are the spare parts left in my set when I was all done. Take note of the white dot at the center of that peal gold stud.</p>

<b>The Minifigure/s:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We get a nicely printed figure here. I like the silver print representing the fitting rings of his suit and other gear. I really like the logo for this theme as well, it is very much reminiscent of the old classic logo and the orange lining also makes an otherwise bland white outfit pop in a very good way. The only downer is that once again we get the astronaut from set 30365. For those of us who enjoy unique figures getting a repeat is not that fun. Thankfully, he is always in a suit so you can overlook the look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Completed Model:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The completed set looks outstanding! The craft looks sleek and fast. I am particularly fond of how those large sloping pieces blend into both the lining of the flight deck and the wings. The nozzle style engine thrusts are super fun and actually allow you to stand the model vertically if you want to. Similarly if you have hollow studs you can put them in there and still keep the nozzle function intact. Doing so allows you add translucent studs in there to simulate engine heat and exhaust.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hollow enclosure at the rear of the craft houses a real fun feature in that you can transport a satellite in there. The unit is small and simple but looks very nice. Part of me wishes they had brought back the translucent parts from 2015 but these dark blue panels with clips detailed with stickers work well with this color scheme. Housing the satellite within also gives the appearance of a main power unit to the ship which only further enhances its looks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>But it is the ability to further customize this design into a fighter or hauler that really make it a fun toy. For those who like to set up dioramas this set out of the box looks very nice as a display model as well.</p>

<p>The only 2 negatives to it are that 1: the orange suited astronauts do not fit in this model without removing their air tanks. Not a big deal in the grand scheme of things but having to remove an integral part of an astronaut to get them in here is kind of disappointing. 2nd the ship does not have the components necessary to dock to the modular system developed for this line in 2019. You would need to heavily modify the design or add an assembly into the cargo area at the rear that allows for a connection to other sets in this theme.</p>

<p><br />
<b>Overall:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a stand alone toy or display model this thing is great! The included parts alone do a great job of filling the head with all sorts of scenarios and the ability to expand or alter the roles of this craft with minimal modifications is great! Alas, it is a shame that making it fit into the rest of the theme with some sort of assembly that allows it to dock to any of the sets in the wave requires heavy modification.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still on its own as a long range cargo hauler or explorer/fighter this thing is loads of fun and is bound to please any child with a predisposition to things that fly and have engines.</p>

<p>During the build a hanger bay is created in the back to store the side build satellite. A couple of white pieces were placed so they could either lock the satellite in place or allow it to slide out for deployment. A very nice feature! Even with the large hollow area, the entire vehicle felt reasonably strong during swoosh-ing.</p>

<h3><b>Side Build</b></h3>

<p>I actually think this was a really nice build. Two stickers are used to provide detail to the satellite&#39;s solar panels. The panels themselves are clipped onto the craft &quot;upside&quot; down giving the craft a pretty neat effect. Storage and deployment of the satellite is fairly smooth. During a shake test the storage bay clasps kept the satellite in place fairly well. They were jostled out of place a bit but not enough to allow the satellite to fall out.</p>

<h3><b>Mini-Fig</b></h3>

<p>The set comes with one astronaut figure.&nbsp; This is a personal preference but I don&#39;t like the new-style space helmets. I came across when I got the 50th anniversary of the Lunar Lander kit in July and it holds up here. I prefer the basic motorcycle helmet and trans-blue visor like in the <a data-blogger-escaped-target=""_blank"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31066-1/Space-Shuttle-Explorer"">Shuttle Explorer</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actual figure is predominately white with orange and black highlights. Those highlights represent the flexible joints in the hard shell of the suit. The visor consists of two pieces, a white helmet-air tank-chest piece and a large visor painted in gold. The astronaut has only one face, that of a generic &quot;man of action&quot;.</p>

<h3><b>Conclusions&nbsp;</b></h3>

<p>Overall, this is an okay set. I love the overall aesthetic of the kit. The sticker use isn&#39;t too heavy to either with only four total being used. The amount of stuff in the kit (the shuttle, satellite and figure) also feels good. The only downside to is the mini-fig&#39;s helmet design. If you really want a set from the 2019 Space line, this a fun cheap set to get!</p>

"VerMonster","2019-11-26T22:14:39.897Z","Great little set","<p>I&#39;m probably odd here, but I think LEGO needs to focus more on GOOD, sub-$20 sets, and this one hits all the high points for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts. OK, it&#39;s a ten dollar set, you don&#39;t get a lot of parts, and there are stickers. I dislike stickers, personally, but I prefer them to not having anything but plain bricks and printing is too expensive. I just need to cut back on my caffiene intake, take my time, and put them on straight.</p>

<p>Playability. Pretty high. The shuttle is very swooshable, and both the satellite and the minifig&nbsp;have a fair degree of playability for what they are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Design. The shuttlecraft is great. Simple but elegant, and it&#39;s a great jumping off point for MOCing up. That it has a trunk (boot for you who don&#39;t speak American :P ) is a nice touch, and that adds to the playability. It is similar to the one in one of the Overwatch sets but much nicer.</p>

<p>The design of the minifig is the astronaut we&#39;ve had for a while, and while it isn&#39;t terribly reflective of any design in use or on the drawing boards, it is infinitely better than Classic Space.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The satellite is a simple build. I like it, even though it isn&#39;t as good as the one in 30365. No big deal, there are lots of satellites, and this can be MOCed up to be something more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great entry/budget set for a theme that sadly looks like it is being abandoned in 2020. If I can get them on clearance in a month or two, I&#39;ll get a few more for myself, as it is a good fleet builder.&nbsp;</p>

"REGINALDO","2019-11-29T20:06:12.493Z","Satellite Service Mission","<p>I purchased this set as a fan of spacecraft, moon and mars travel, and of course love the space themed sets. Particularly, I really liked this set, the price is good, including for Brazil where prices are much more expensive.<br />
All in all it&#39;s a great 5-note set, I liked the design of the spacecraft, the crewman (astronaut) in white outfit, and the satellite that comes docked at the rear of the ship.</p>

<p>Easy assembly, it is an excellent set. In my view, it will inspire the US and European space agencies (NASA and ESA) to build spaceships.</p>
