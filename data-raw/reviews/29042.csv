<p>There are six booklets covering various sections of the build.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Book 1 covered the motorcycle and the taxi.&nbsp; Fairly straightforward builds and contained seven stickers.&nbsp; Three minifigs with this one, policeman, crook and taxi driver.</p>

<p>Book 2 covered the TV van and had two minifigs these being the camera man and the female reporter.&nbsp; This one had four stickers.&nbsp; I wasn&#39;t quite sure what the &#39;postbox&#39; on the side of the van was for.&nbsp; The inside of the van had two each of 2x2 slope with radar &amp; disc slot pattern and computer screen pattern. Those pretty much filled up the back of the van.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Book 3 covered the toy shop.&nbsp; This contained a display of toys in the window and on the roof of the shop the sign and a couple of balloons.&nbsp; I loved the hat with the propellor on the top.&nbsp; I&#39;ve not seen this before.&nbsp; Two minfigs, little boy on skate board and his mum, and five stickers.</p>

<p>Book 4/5 covered the baristas mobile coffee trolley and the shop.&nbsp; This is the one that has the doughnut on the top but it is made later.&nbsp; The coffee trolley had three stickers and was in the form of a tricycle.&nbsp; I hadn&#39;t seen the white take&nbsp;out cups before and I see they have only been used in six sets before including this one. Two minifigs with this one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The coffee shop itself contained a display of cakes &amp; biscuits, a seating area and coffee making area.&nbsp; Four&nbsp;stickers on that one.&nbsp; A cash machine is on the side of the building.&nbsp; I struggled a little bit with the dark blue panel wheel arch that went on the front of the building, but got there in the end.&nbsp; The roof had the mechanism for flicking the doughnut off the roof.&nbsp; Great fun that was!</p>

<p>Book 6 covered making the lorry cab.&nbsp; This was an orange colour&nbsp;and had four stickers and one minifig.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t find this particularly difficult to do.&nbsp; This one had the exhaust pipes clipped at the top with 1x1&nbsp;plate with clip.&nbsp; Six wheels on this.</p>

<p>Finally book 7/8 covered making the trailer and the doughnut.&nbsp; Four stickers used here.&nbsp; Quite a bit of work with the trailer.&nbsp; Bit of technic stuff here to enable the arm to rise up.&nbsp; There was also a rest for when the arm was down and two support arms for when it was in use.&nbsp; Not too clear on the purpose of the grey/black/orange thing on the turntable at the back.&nbsp; You couldn&#39;t attach the doughnut to it. I&#39;ll leave you to decide what that was for.&nbsp; The doughnut consisted of making an inner circle to which to attach the pink and dark tan sections of the doughnut which was then lifted into position by the crane.&nbsp; As I said earlier, I had great fun flicking the doughnut off the top of the coffee shop!</p>
