Even though it is a quick build that doesn&#39;t have any big centerpiece, each sub-scene in this build has either fun working mechanics, heartwarming characters/pieces/story, or both. My gf and I assembled this together and kept holding up fun new pieces for each other to see and smiling ear to ear. This was fun to put together, fun to display, fun to take pictures of, and also interactive! There are 3 cool moving pieces that make this fun fair scene come to life! Would absolutely recommend!</p>

AFOLs especially who build city diorama like the author, are very glad every time the new LEGO&reg; People Pack is released. The LEGO&reg; People Pack set theme for this review is the Fun Fair. This set consists of 183 parts which will build up into 14 minifigures and several games.</p>

<p>Builds that constructed from this set is the shooting gallery, strength test, duck ring toss, face paint, and ice cream cart. One important thing is that on this set you will get yellow duckling. At the time this article is made, the duckling is only available on 6 sets. And on this set you get 3 ducklings! On the shooting gallery, you can shoot LEGO&reg; parts to the target that can make the target fall back. Even though there are three targets, but this set only provide one shooter.</p>

<p>The strength test game has a component that when pressed down (to simulate a hit) will launch an indicator component upwards to simulate the power of the hitter, and it is complemented by round flat tiles to represent the power lights. For ice cream cart, the author is glad for more variation other than hot dog cart. Recently, the author notices that the LEGO&reg; company start to introduce ice cream vendor into the latest sets such as LEGO&reg; City <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60200-1/Capital-City"">60200 - Capital City</a>, City <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60253-1/Ice-Cream-Truck"">60253 - Ice Cream Truck</a>, Friends <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/41389-1/Ice-Cream-Cart"">41389 - Ice Cream Cart</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40344-1/Summer-Celebration-Minifigure-Pack"">40344 Summer Celebration Minifigure Set</a>.</p>

<p>There are 8 adults, 2 elders and 4 children on this set. The elderly is a couple. The grandfather is enjoying ice cream while the grandmother is enjoying warm coffee. There is&nbsp;adult couple who enjoy playing ring toss. There is a youngster eating a hotdog on the fun fair. A boy with propeller hat is engrossed in playing shooting gallery to win a purple teddy for her female friend. The shooting gallery is watched by a male adult with rocker t-shirt.</p>

<p>A woman with leather jacket is preparing to test her strength with huge mallet. A boy is enjoying ice cream he bought from a lady selling ice cream. A female painter is face painting tiger drawing on a girl&rsquo;s face. And of course it will not be called a fun fair without a clown standing on stilts handing out animal-shaped balloon to children.</p>

<p>When the component and minifigures from this set are combined, we will see that this LEGO&reg; People Pack is already very interesting and looks very lively. This set can be moved to a place with bazaar scene in a city diorama. Unfortunately, this is the only LEGO&reg; People Pack that has 14 minifigures while the other 4 LEGO&reg; People Pack sets have 15 minifigures in it.</p>

<p>This set nearly score a perfect rating from me if only it provides 15 minifigures instead of only 14 minifigures. I do not know what is in the mind of the designer by only giving 14 minifigures (unless the designer consider the 3 small ducklings is equal to 1 minifigure).</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>Building People Pack is enjoyable especially knowing that we are getting more minifigures. We can ever switch the parts and cross-dress all the minifigures.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Other than we only receive 14 minifigures for this set, I will have no other complain. We are getting some interesting parts such as the three little duckling and dog shaped balloon parts.&nbsp;And don&#39;t forget, we have an ice cream peddler!</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Adult will love the variety of the minifigures a long with the accessories. It is a must for people building a theme park for their city dioramas. Children will also definitely enjoy this set!</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>The price for people pack is usually reasonable. If you wait until it get discounted, it is even better!!</p>

<p><strong>Special Note</strong></p>

<p>Please note that I write this review based on my own LEGO Blog article which is available from:&nbsp;<a href=""https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-set-review-60234-people-pack-fun-fair"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab."">https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-set-review-60234-people-pack-fun-fair</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this insight from me will be useful for all AFOLs out there!</p>
