"dylzone","2019-12-03T15:36:53.497Z","Must buy for overwatch fans","<p>Despite no minifigs, the set makes up for it with a triple molded piece that represents Hammond (the hamster that drives the mech). In terms of playability&nbsp;it only has a transforming feature which is disappointing&nbsp;but allows for more detail. The parts include alot&nbsp;of sand green few yellow (including 2 handlebars) and some black.</p>

<p>overall i would defiantly recommend&nbsp;this set.</p>

"Green_Bricks","2020-03-31T13:09:44.217Z","Great choice, Overwatch fan or not","<p>As an owner of this set, I am in what I believe to be quite a large, unexpected group; people who bought this set, despite having no knowledge or interest in the franchise it came from. I&#39;m still not completely sure what drew me and so many others to this model which I&#39;d never heard of, but I can safely say that, in terms of being a unique, affordable Lego set above all else, this set is one of extremely high quality. That being said, let me tell you all about it.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p>For a set with just over 200 pieces, this one took me a while to assemble. Part of that assembly time, admittedly, was taken up by applying some quite intricate stickers, especially the round ones for curved surfaces. Also, I spent some time throughout the build trying to get all the moveable parts to line up into the configuration that I wanted (I&#39;ll get onto those later!). Still, the pure Lego building aspect was great fun and quite satisfying, being able to watch such an odd, un-Lego-like structure coming together. This set felt more like the experience I might have gained from a &pound;30 or &pound;40 set, taking up a decent amount of time, but the end result is just as satisfying; I enjoy knowing that I put a little more care and love into this set than some City set&nbsp;you build from the bottom straight up (not to take a jab at City sets, but sometimes you need something a bit more interesting).</p>

<p><strong>Completed model</strong></p>

<p>Okay, I had to say it eventually; this may just be my opinion, but I think that this set looks incredible. I have it in the form where its legs and turrets are out, and the colour scheme, shaping and compact size all complement each other perfectly for me. As mentioned earlier, it&#39;s slightly tedious trying to get all the armour plates to line up, but it is truly something wonderful to behold when you put in the time to do so. The curved elements make the model look futuristic;&nbsp;not quite cyberpunk, something beyond steampunk, very sci-fi anyway. The heavy duty weapons look menacing and dangerous, and I somewhat wish I could afford to purchase some colour variants and build an army with a dozen of these, ranging throughout the colour spectrum with some more vibrant tones, along with the earthy, muted ones. Overall, a great looking model in my opinion.</p>

<p><strong>Figure</strong></p>

<p>No minifigures are included in this set, but we do get one exclusive character, the one piece, anthropomorthic hamster by the name of Hammond. Despite how incredible this set is, this,&nbsp;<strong>this</strong>&nbsp;little piece right here, was a clinching factor in me eventually purchasing this one. The levels of duel moulding here are unparalleled by some top range minifigures. There are detailed ears, paws and a miniature jetpack, and the fact that this figure doesn&#39;t lead to the price of the set&nbsp;skyrocketing is incredible to me. Very, very nice.</p>

<p><strong>The 3 Ps</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>P</strong>rice - for &pound;17.99, I honestly don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to go wrong; this set appeals mainly to sci-fi fans, but would be a welcome addition to any fan&#39;s collection; heck, you don&#39;t even necessarily have to like Lego. As long as you have a grasp on how to put the thing together ,it looks great on display, and I would recommend purchasing it.</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong>layability - I haven&#39;t gone into it much above, but this set has serious play potential. It has lots of chunks on clips and ball joints, allowing the legs to fold up into a ball, hence the &#39;wrecking ball&#39; name, and this ball can vaguely roll across a flat surface. The turrets can be hidden away, or folded out manually. There is a cockpit lid on the top, which you can flip open, and hidden behind one of the turrets, there is a knob which you can rotate to spring Hammond upwards, out into the open, on a platform with a changeable elevation. Although this feature doesn&#39;t work perfectly for me, if you can find a way to better implement it, then it could be extremely enjoyable for younger children (well, and me). Lots of play features, all packed into a small set, so perfect for acting out adventures.</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong>arts - So. Much. Sand. GREEN! The colours in this set are a blessing from Lego, with no less than 42 parts in sand green, many of them new and exclusive. Add in some orange ball joints, yellow handlebars, printed radar dish &amp; windshield and that incredible little Hammond, and you&#39;ve got yourself a parts pack to rival most sets of this size. Resellers, be intrigued!</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>As of the time of me writing this review, the set is available on Lego&#39;s website and Amazon, so I say what are you waiting for? And if you already have this set but haven&#39;t built it yet, dig it out and spend your isolation period doing something fun! I can&#39;t tell you with 100% certainty that you&#39;ll love it as much as I do, because you all have opinions which I will never know, but I can wholeheartedly say that I <strong>think</strong> you&#39;ll love it.</p>

"Watsonite","2020-12-02T19:10:44.957Z","New balls please","<p>I have no idea whatsoever what Overwatch is and who or what the Ham creature is supposed to be. OK, cutting some corners here. I did know it is a video game as is also clear by the Blizzard logo on the box. But that&#39;s about it. So why do I own the set?</p>

<p>There is not really an explanation&nbsp;here. I seemed cool, it was more than reasonably priced; and as mentioned, it seemed cool.</p>

<p>This Miley Cyrus-toy comes with a small character, moulded in one piece. Normally I do love my minifigures but the hamster is cute and the set doesn&#39;t leave you wanting for more figs.</p>

<p>The build consists of two parts; the centre core with the &#39;lift&#39; mechanism for Ham, and the outer shell which can open and close to shift between &#39;battle&#39; mode and &#39;rolling&#39; mode. I found the build to be pleasant and varied. Some nice techniques as well as bricks are being used and there isn&#39;t all that much fiddling around. The colour palette is striking but of course already determined by the source material.</p>

<p>There is a sticker sheet but it is small. Luckily there are some nicely printed elements here. Lego&#39;s sticker logic is more often than not obscure and unclear. Some small sets have printed elements and the big-buck-boxes come with sticker sheets. But with Ham&#39;s tank-y vehicle, a mix of both.</p>

<p>The design is clever with both the lift for Ham as the folding shell. The shell&nbsp;conceals and reveals weapons and turns into legs. Cool.</p>

<p>I assume that knowing the franchise adds value for the set, but I never experienced my lack of knowledge on Overwatch as a problem. This is a cool set for any sci fi fan and even more inspired than many Star Wars sets out there.</p>

<p>I loved building Wrecking Ball and it is small set that will be kept built for a while.Smaller sets have the tendency to move to the large Lego shelves rather soon over here. Ham however&nbsp;has got himself an extended welcome</p>

<p>Now how about a Ham-Ham crossover with the homonymic character from Toy Story?</p>
