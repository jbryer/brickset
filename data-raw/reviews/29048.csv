<p>One of the best things that I like about this build is that primary configuration divides the parts and pieces into numbered bags, so you&#39;re not spending 80% of your time in the initial steps looking for the right piece after a vigorous organization. &nbsp;There are 6 pouches for the entire build and each pouch is a modular part of the overall primary build: 3 for the&nbsp;cafe (1 pouch per floor), 2 for the townhouse (1 per floor) and one for the courtyard. I wish all Lego sets were packaged like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This sets includes some good unique pieces that add architectural aspects to your build. It also gives some good ways to incorporate architectural ideas into your independent builds too. &nbsp;The sliding red shutters are a nice touch and the pergola on the third floor loft is a nice touch made with your standard pieces. &nbsp;small details here and there add a nice touch to this set to include: the bookshelf below the TV, the red sliding shutters, the signage for the pet shop and the architectural elements of the townhouse.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a modular set and can be connected/incorporated to your other buildings. &nbsp;Even the secondary builds off this 3 in 1 have modular&nbsp;connections and should be able to be incorporated into your overall city plan too. &nbsp;Great details make this a great addition to the Expert Creator sets and stands up with relatable details and heights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall an awesome set with great adaptability, a well written 355 pages instruction guide, three minifigs, and an overall fun build that you can do at once or take your time doing without leaving piles of pieces around. &nbsp;With close to a 1000 pieces, you get a diverse set of pieces and for a not so bad price. &nbsp;Would recommend and will be building and rebuilding many times over.&nbsp;</p>

"Zapp_Brannigan","2020-12-27T21:45:21.88Z","Mini Modulars A Great Step for Beginners","<p>Naturally, I&#39;m a City fan, so any city-related set I come across usually warrants closer inspection. Creator, and by extension, Creator Expert (including modulars of course), has released countless sets over the years which may just as well belong to the City theme. Of course, the biggest difference with Creator is, as its name suggests, it is meant for more stimulating building experiences, hence the builds tend to be more intricate and less juniorized with opportunities&nbsp;for alternate 3-1 models and beyond.</p>

<p>The Townhouse Pet Shop &amp; Cafe is no exception. For a set of its size the amount of detail gone into the design is impressive to say the least. Noting that open back construction is used, the buildings have substantial depth for their size and are not simply facades (which unfortunately have plagued City sets today). The diverse range of colours and architectural styles is perhaps the set&#39;s greatest assets;&nbsp;the latter lends itself to details that are almost at the modular level.</p>

<p>Please note this review is for the primary build. I do not plan on building the secondary or tertiary models.</p>

<p>The build is divided into six bags and total build time is three hours. Three minifigures are included. The first minifigure is a guy with a baseball cap and Hawaiian shirt, the second is an elderly gentleman, and the last is a female child.&nbsp;I usually don&#39;t notice the minifigures all that much, but I felt that three minifigures are not enough; two more would have sufficed. Of course, we can populate the rooms to each building with our own minifigures, but as is, the set&nbsp;feels a bit empty.</p>

<p>The first building is the cafe. Stonework and arches dominate the facade to the cafe. There is a cup sign over the entrance, and I really like how the entrance awning is a car roof. Inside the cafe is a table, dining bench, stool, and cash register. A small oven or coffee maker would have been preferred to serve as a kitchen area. The second floor is a kitchen with stove, sink, and drawers. A wooden drawer is also included on the other side of the room as well as small plant vase on the window sill. Whether the kitchen&nbsp;belongs to the cafe, the modern townhouse next door, or to its own apartment is left ambiguous to the builder. The balcony, windows, and roof are beautifully detailed using a combination of arches and decorations, including parrots! A small garden sits on the roof.&nbsp;A common design used&nbsp;is offsetting the windows and doors,&nbsp;so they are not flush with the front walls. The second floor window, for example, uses jumper pieces to give an offset to the window, adding depth to the appearance. This is a common practice seen widely in modular buildings.</p>

<p>At the street corner is an open patio belonging to the cafe. Here, there are a couple seats and table with checkered tablecloth and croissant. A small, crooked tree made using technic angled axle connectors provides shade to the patio. A menu is posted on the side of the cafe and is the exact same piece used in 10243 Parisian Restaurant.</p>

<p>The second building is the pet shop and modern apartment. The pet shop has a fish tank, parrot stand, and counter with mouse and cheese block underneath. Pet accessories including balls and dogbones are put right outside the shop. An ATM sits on the right side of the pet shop with a single dollar bill in the machine. I think it&#39;s neat how a chair is used as a&nbsp;cover for the ATM.&nbsp;The pet shop sign is made using a number of 1x1 quarter circle tiles to show a dog and bird. The second floor is the modern apartment living room with small TV screen sitting on a shelf, a modern style couch, and a planter. The third floor is the bedroom with a bed, and a night stand with a light and cell phone. A door leads out to the balcony where there is a large&nbsp;planter. A solar panel is mounted on the roof, no doubt providing the home a modern source of power. The&nbsp;apartment is wonderfully detailed, using brick bricks to give both the exterior and interior walls contours, as well as sleek glass panels for the windows and railings. The balcony awning is a timber trellis constructed unconventionally using 1x8 tiles mounted sideways on clips. The red shutters also provide depth to the modern appearance and can slide along the rails to their desired positions. An AC unit is mounted on the third floor sidewall while a large brick built coffee sign is placed on the second floor sidewall. My only gripe is the traffic light, which should be a separate structure instead of being attached to the apartment.</p>

<p>A hot dog stand is included which includes a single hot dog, and ketchup and mustard dispensers. The sign is a brick built hot dog whose size causes a high centre of gravity and therefore the cart is prone to tipping over on its short side, though this is rarely a problem and the brick built hot dog is very creative.</p>

<p>As mentioned, the colours balance one another perfectly and convey a sense of busyness to the typical street corner scene. The light yellow and dark azure are fairly uncommon (at least for me, they don&#39;t appear in any set I own).</p>

<p>A number of brick built animals are included, including a dog (which looks suspiciously familiar to Brian from Family Guy), mouse, parrot, and bird.</p>

<p>Each floor section is modular allowing for easier access and alternate arrangements. Both buildings are connected using a gutter pipe which runs between the roof of the modern apartment to the cafe roof. The layout is an L-shape which occupies a 24x24 area minus the rear 12x12 corner cutout, and is rigid which does not allow hinging between the buildings. Each of the three sections comprising the cafe, apartment, and outdoor patio can be rearranged to the builder&#39;s liking, and is connected using&nbsp;Technic pins.</p>

<p>There are no stickers in this set as everything is printed. At $100 CAD the price is perfect for the number of pieces you get. Numerous parallels may be drawn with the modular buildings in terms of design and construction. As a result, I consider this set to be an excellent cheaper alternative to full fledged modulars, and it is also the perfect introduction to modular buildings for younger audiences. From an AFOL perspective, this set is also well suited for conversion to a full modular building, which I plan to do in the future. As it is, however, it is also quite good and a superb addition to any Lego city.</p>
