It is large and has a significant amount of long/large bricks. The rotors are also very large, there are 6 of them, and they can be creatively reused in your own custom builds.&nbsp;It has very few &quot;junk bricks&quot; (the small colourful parts that you can not build with, that Lego Friends are full of).</p>

<p>Building experience was good, though not great. At the beginning it felt kind of slow, though it got much better after the chassis was built. The rotors can be misaligned and hit each other, so one has to watch that while building.</p>

<p>This model has a few moving elements: the rotors can be rotated with a small gear at the tail, one wall can be moved thus allowing figures to enter/leave, there is another gear that can lower or raise the submarine drone on a string. The cabin can also be easily detached.</p>

<p>For KFOLs, as a model to play with, it is at most good. My kids do enjoy it a lot, it is fun to play, but as I see it as a parent it has some flaws.&nbsp;But some elements detach easily (side-panels on tail, wheels, some antennas(?) below cabin)&nbsp;and can be easily lost. The model is large and can not be picked up easily by a 5-6 YO. It is difficult to hold it firmly with one hand.</p>

<p>The one real downside of this set is that&nbsp;there is only one minifigure. I would have&nbsp;expected more, say two&nbsp;pilots/engineers and a diver.</p>

<p>Overall, I&nbsp;think this set is very good. The helicopter looks great and is fun to play with for kids. Even with the few minor flaws I can recommend it wholeheartedly.&nbsp;</p>
