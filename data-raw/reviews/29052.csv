I think at the price point of $40 dollars this was an ok value for the money buy could have definitely been a $35 set. The minifigures are nice however would have been nicer to see it come with maybe one more minifig or perhaps a little something for Poe to wield like a mounted blaster cannon. I however do think this set as a whole was a solid 4/5 experience.</p>
