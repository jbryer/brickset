This one depicts&nbsp;the scene at the end where Rey and Kylo are facing each other, engaging in a light sabre duel while the planet / base is breaking apart, on its way to blowing up. In the end, it does a decent job in its representation, and there is some possibility of play. That said, for a 200 piece set, it simply looks small, mostly because many of those pieces are used in building up the base. That said, there are enough play features to make this set interesting: the planet can split apart and two sets of trees can be knocked over during the fight. Of course, Rey and Kylo can fight it out as well.</p>

<p>The two minifigures are nice, and the Kylo Ren figure is actually unique (so far), while Rey is absolutely not (as she is found in 5 other sets). The prints are well done, and each of them has two facial expressions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is a nice set, with some play value, and it even looks nice on display. I can also see where the RRP is coming from, even though in sheer size it does not look as such.&nbsp;The construction of the display is fun as well. As such, I personally like what this set has to offer. Especially when you come across it at reduced price, one could seriously consider picking it up.</p>

I enjoyed the building process, and the finished&nbsp;set looks great on a desk&nbsp;whether it&#39;s&nbsp;&quot;closed&quot; together or split open a bit to showcase the&nbsp;lava. The trees are small, but if they were larger they would overwhelm the set, so I like them the size that they are. And Lego has done a great job mixing the green and white leaves to give the impression of a snowy forest.</p>

<p>Kylo Ren&#39;s minifig has an alternate face with the wound on his face and a shocked&nbsp;expression right after Rey defeated him and right before the planet split open. It&#39;s a great minifig head, and I appreciate Lego including it because it was a key moment from this scene.</p>

<p>In terms of&nbsp;play features, the falling trees and&nbsp;the splitting terrain is all very&nbsp;smooth and works well, and the spinning disks that you can stand Rey and Kylo on work&nbsp;better than I expected -- set up their lightsabers at the right angle and they can knock each other aside.</p>

<p>All in all, this is one of my favorite recent Star Wars sets, and&nbsp;I expect that I will have it on display for a very, very long time.</p>
