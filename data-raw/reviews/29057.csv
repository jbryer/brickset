Out of every superhero in both the Marvel and DC stables there is no vehicle as well known and recognisable as the Batmobile, despite the fact that over 80 years of comics, toys, movies and TV the Batmobile has had no consistent design. Some are more artistic and stylised, some more grungy and militaristic - some are just black cars with a bat-logo haphazardly stamped on the bonnet.</p>

<p>Ah but this right here, this toy is designed to evoke the 1989 movie Batmobile - long, protruding nose, single-seat cockpit thrust right back, bat wings in place of a spoiler. Designed to evoke the look, mind, not designed to slavishly adhere to it. This is a blessed relief as it allows the design of the car to breathe somewhat, to be it&#39;s own thing, and not need to compromise in the name of screen accuracy, something which has troubled Star Wars toys for many years now.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>Building the toy is generally unchallenging, although the process is a little archaic compared to modern Lego standards, in that in the early portions of the framework the front and back end look very similar, meaning you need to be somewhat on the ball to not go accidentally attaching pieces to the wrong end. It&#39;s only a minor gripe though, and overall the model comes together with little difficulty.</p>

<h3>The Completed Model</h3>

<p>On completion you are left with a beast of a vehicle, especially when placed alongside the smaller Lego City cars. Not that that&#39;s a problem - the Batmobile is supposed to be big and intimidating. What impresses - from an AFOL point of view at least - is that a couple of action features are included without taking away from the overall design of the vehicle. Which is to say, the look and design of the Batmobile come first, the fold-out stud shooters and spinning flame-exhaust come second.</p>

<p>While stud shooters are definitely old hat by now, the way they tuck into the fuselage of the car make them entirely inoffensive. Neither is the flame-exhaust, but I can&#39;t help but feel that the rear portion of the car could have been better used as a place to stow the captured Joker, but sadly it isn&#39;t to be. The space available would always have been a tight squeeze for a minifigure, but the Technic axle and gears make it impossible.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Ah yes, the minifigs. They&#39;re not exactly the highlight of the set, but they&#39;re certainly functional. Batman is in a rather bland grey suit with a printed-on utility belt, with the newer cowl with the shorter ears and no built-in chinstrap. Sadly this apparently necessitates a printed face on a black minifig head, which invariably comes out too pale. Perhaps this is a welcome change from the overly-tanned Batmen of recent years, but honestly it just feels unnecessary. A normal flesh-toned head would do just fine. And thankfully the older cowl has no trouble squeezing its longer ears into the Batmobile canopy, so if you have one of these lying around spare it&#39;s an easy swap.</p>

<p>The Joker has gone back to his &#39;classic&#39; look that he sported between 2012 and 2016, albeit with a new torso print that makes him the more interesting of the two minifigs. In a bright purple waistcoat over a green shirt, this is a well-decked-out Joker, rather than the scruffier versions that the movies have been offering over the years. Sadly his only accessory is a stud-shooter gun to fire splodges of purest green - presumably some dastardly chemical or other. A shame that more uniquely Joker-y accessories were eschewed in favour of bland functionality.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>I don&#39;t hesitate in saying that this is the best Batmobile Lego has produced so far, in minifig scale at least. While it still stops short of perfect (no lockup in the rear, bland minifigs), it does the important stuff better than any other version.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also noteworthy that this single toy gives kids and collectors alike everything they need for Batman: the Dark Knight himself, his nemesis, and the iconic car. If&nbsp;this were the only Batman set you bought, you wouldn&#39;t be missing anything. While the price is hardly generous, it doesn&#39;t feel like a ripoff either, unless you were desperately expecting more minifigs with nowhere to put them. In essence then, this is a must-buy if you have no Batman sets at all, and a deserved upgrade if you&#39;ve been disappointed with Batmobiles in the past.</p>

<p>A more iconic duo is difficult to name, and to add one of the most iconic vehicles in pop media serves only to make this set more appealing to comic book fans.</p>

<p>But is it as good as first appears?</p>

<p>Simply put, yes. At &pound;25 for 342 parts, it is already well above the typical 10p per part aim that most people want. And for a change, it&#39;s not actually bulked up with lots of small parts to make it seem better value. The Batmobile is substantial, being one of the longest Minifigure scale mobiles to date as it rather dwarfs the included two figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not that this is a bad thing, per say. Oversized vehicles are often problematic, but this one does it well and is not made bulky by the included play features either which fit into the build well. The spinning flame at the rear is activated by turning the rear axle, and the weapons are two stud shooters which fold down with ease or can be left off without affecting the overall appearance. The almost pure&nbsp;black look works well as expected, broken only by the lights on the front and rear, the grey bat-symbol on the front, the grey piping and the yellow hubcaps on the wheels.<br />
<br />
It seems to draw inspiration from the 89 film in it&#39;s rear end&nbsp;design, though towards the front reminds me of the 90&#39;s animated series Batmobile.</p>

<p>The two included figures are fantastic, both detailed well without being over the top though as the same Batman appears in three other sets it does rather take the value of him away. The Joker himself is exclusive and doesn&#39;t wear a jacket as his main outfit, instead opting for a purple waistcoat with dark green sleeves. He seems to be loosely based on the newest Lego videogame version, minus a few details.<br />
<br />
Of course, that&#39;s not to say the set doesn&#39;t have it&#39;s flaws. The same Batman as in the other sets is disappointing, and another figure could have easily added some extra value to this set.<br />
<br />
As far as new parts/prints go, aside from the figures, as far as I am aware the only new print is in the Bat-symbols which are small discs which fit on the round shield. You get an extra of these, which is a lovely inclusion.</p>

"Puidwen","2020-04-21T00:03:58.247Z","Right up to the end i thought this was going to turn out better.","<p>First off the thing gives off a very 80s batman vibe.&nbsp; About equal in size to the jedi starfighter form 75214.&nbsp; Make sure you fold the wings all the way up or it looks a bit weird and not in an weird 80s type of way.&nbsp; The instructions are mostly clear, although i did have a few problems with perspective.&nbsp; I end up having to move a few parts.&nbsp; It holds together when finished.&nbsp; I mention this because some of the parts (the mufflers?) are partially held in by friction.&nbsp; It also left a a few plates dangling in the middle of construction.&nbsp; Lego did an excellent&nbsp;job on all the printing on this set, including the hubcabs.&nbsp; The Minfig batman has a very nice torso print, which is semi metalic, and two head prints, a scowl and a smile.&nbsp; I must confess i can&#39;t put him in the batmobile without the cape flaring up behind his head.&nbsp; I would said the real prize of this set is actually the Joker minfig.&nbsp; All the colours on the clown are very bright. He has has a very excellent printing on the suit.&nbsp;The head has two faceprints, a cheerful one, and an upset one. The faceprint does come off as a bit &quot;gritty&quot; when i think they were going for one of the more campy jokers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Edit:&nbsp; After digging through my parts i found this set is prime for modification.&nbsp; Just two 8x1 tiles on the side, and switching out the two 1x2 tiles in the middle of the engine for a 1x4 help a lot.</p>

"boptop123456789","2020-05-14T14:45:50.88Z","One of the best Batman and Dc sets in a while","<p>This is my first batmobile ever, and I really love it! I&#39;ll talk about the build first. The car itself looks a lot like the 1989 version of it. I looked and it looks a lot like the rebirth version of the batmobile. For play features, there&#39;s some stud shooters which are just getting old at this point, but they don&#39;t look too bad. The fun part about this set is the flame on the back turns when you push it forward, it reminds me of an old batmobile toy I had which was cool.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now for the mini figures. The highlight is the Joker. He has some amazing printing based on Lego Dc Supervillains, it&#39;s my second joker after the LBM one and I like it. Batman is the same as the other new sets, but he&#39;s based on the rebirth version and I&#39;m really into the comics, so I love the Batman.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great set. With an awesome build and amazing mini figures! I definitely recommend it to all Batman and Dc fans.</p>

"FullMetalScars","2020-03-13T21:03:46.517Z","OK-mobile","<p>While the end result is aesthetically pleasing, there are a few design choices that could have been done better. The roof is attached&nbsp;to the windshield by two small pegs, and the windshield is only connected to a hinge plate at the front. As a result the windshield and roof pop off a lot when being played with. The build itself has a lot of small parts that can make it difficult to do for younger builders without help. There are a lot of tight fits that smaller fingers may have trouble with alone. As an adult, I enjoyed the moderate complexity of the build for myself.</p>

<p>Overall this was an enjoyable build. The rear axel spinning the fire at the rear of the car is a really simple and cool feature.&nbsp;</p>
