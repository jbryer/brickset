<p>-Minifigs-</p>

<p>Batman: He&#39;s&nbsp;fine. Same as other sets.</p>

<p>Robin: Looks good. He also comes in the batcave, so this is the easiest way to get him.</p>

<p>Mr. Freeze: Looks amazing! Very reminiscent of the very first Mr. Freeze minifig.</p>

<p>-Parts-</p>

<p>It has some good parts. The wings on the back would be good for making a small batmobile. The snowmobile comes with a cool trans-light blue slope with glitter in it. It also comes with the piece pack containing hooks, grenades, and other things.</p>

<p>-The build-</p>

<p>The build process is&nbsp;fine, but if it is broken, careful not to mix up the two sides when rebuilding.</p>

<p>-Completed model-</p>

<p>This model is great for play. The bike can split into two bikes as the main play feature. The back can shoot off a harpoon and the front can shoot off a grenade. The snowmobile isn&#39;t very interesting, but I do like the slope and the spoiler pieces in a new(?) color.</p>

<p>-Value-</p>

<p>I can see this being $20, maybe $25. Well luckily, it&#39;s $20! That seems like a good price for the volume of stuff you get.</p>

<p>-Overall opinion-</p>

<p>This is a good set that gives you a good guy vehicle and a bad guy vehicle, which allows for exciting play. The play features don&#39;t take away from&nbsp;the model, and it seems like a good value for $20.</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s all for my thoughts! I hope they helped you make a decision!</p>
