<p>To begin with the mini figures; this set includes the new Batman mini figure found in other sets for this year, as well as a Bruce Wayne, Robin (based on Damien Wayne), Bat Woman but also includes two bonus mini figures they did not have to include but gave us anyway - Catwoman and Two Face.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The mini Tumbler is a nice build with all 6 wheels having their own part, rather than being dual connected with a technic piece. The Clayface&nbsp;build reminded me of the older Bionicle sets, with an interesting head piece that allows for a moving mouth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Batcave itself consists of 3 separate platforms that build together. The main part in the middle offers the most details for the set, including stickers for the Abraham Lincoln coin and a Joker card. Usually I don&#39;t care for sets with a lot of stickers but in this one, I don&#39;t really mind it, cause it adds a nice touch of detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For those wondering about the middle entrance, yes, the new Batmobile will fit properly and can drive right through.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other connectable pieces are the small prison cell which has a wall breaking mechanic and the platform leading into the Wayne Manor. There is a cool mechanic involved where you place a mini figure on the opening hatch, remove a technic piece and that&#39;s how Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this was a nice set with a variety of different dark colors that fit the Batman theme, offered great mini figures and was well detailed. I look forward to adding onto this.&nbsp;</p>
