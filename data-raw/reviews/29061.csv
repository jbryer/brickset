Now the sets formally in LEGO Juniors have been folded into the main Themes they were linked to and have the new 4+ logo on the bottom of the box. This means the sets have new boxes, which are pretty much the same as the rest of the Theme and you don&rsquo;t need to feel as if you&rsquo;re collecting a different Theme for the sets you enjoy.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Box/Instructions</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Box: The packaging for LEGO Juniors was red and predominantly unique. The 4+ boxes of LEGO DC Super Heroes uses the same design as the rest of Theme, which has changed in 2019 to a dark black packaging design to evoke Batman, because this year it&rsquo;s all about Batman. The back is a breakdown of everything in the set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Instructions: Perfect for young builders, the manual is straight forward and easy to follow along with. The design works great.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set features 59 pieces, one of which is the newish large vehicle chassis part which LEGO uses in Juniors style sets. This one is in black, because we all know Batman doesn&rsquo;t build with anything else. Overall not much in the set though for parts fans.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Batman: This version of Batman has been seen so many times, the printing is not new, which makes sense in a way. That being said, his cape is the newer softer material, so he is an upgrade from his earlier releases in 2012.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Riddler: A brand new torso print is seen here and Riddler gets his new face with this Minifigure, with large mutton chop side-burns and a little stubble. The gold crowbar is here as his accessory, he&rsquo;s trying to break into the ATM to rob it, and he&rsquo;s going to escape on a Skateboard&hellip; oddly I think that&rsquo;s the weirdest idea.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This build is relatively quick and easy for older fans, even the age range might seem a bit cheated if they&rsquo;ve watched older brother or sister building so much more with so many more pieces. However it works for what it is. A quick little thing to build and play with for hours and hours of fun, then you graduate to full-fledged LEGO sets. (At least according to LEGO Marketing.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Batmobile in this set is really fun, it&rsquo;s obviously inspired by the Tim Burton era Batmobile, especially with that flame bursting off the end. The little ATM build is ok, there&rsquo;s no real play feature to it, but a dynamite stick is included to pretend to blow it up. Overall a fairly simplistic introduction to larger LEGO sets from DC Super Heroes.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I try to get most everything DC and Marvel, mostly for the Minifigures, but I haven&rsquo;t grabbed the DUPLO sets just yet. The Juniors sets interested me as well for certain characters or builds. So as a collector I picked this up during a sale, I feel it would be appreciated by some fans and builders, but I&rsquo;m honestly a bit put off by seeing Riddler trying to escape from Batman on a skateboard when he&rsquo;s got a turbo engine powered car to thwart his escape. It&rsquo;s just a really odd and quirky looking idea, which drew me to it. I don&rsquo;t know if this would be a set most folks would want, for the asking price the piece count is a bit poorer, even for a &lsquo;Juniors&rsquo; inspired 4+ set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Overall, slightly recommended.</p>
