"AddictedToStyrene","2019-09-11T02:51:57.433Z","Spoiler-Free review of the 2019 Star Wars Advent Calendar","<p>Spoiler-Free review of 75245 Advent Calendar, for anyone interested in buying it but not wanting to open it until December.</p>

<p>Note: this review doesn&#39;t consider what&#39;s printed on the box (about half of the contents) but it does list numbers of figures/vehicles etc. If your threshold of spoileriness is higher than mine, read on at your own risk. Also, the listing for this set on Brickset shows all the builds, so well done if you&#39;ve come this far with your eyes closed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set contains:</p>

<p>Seven minifigures, including two named characters. Printing is superb, and all figures come with appropriate weapons/accessories.</p>

<p>There is one minifig scale built-up weapon. It&#39;s got some rarer pieces but isn&#39;t amazing. At least there is only one, and no &#39;weapon packs&#39;.</p>

<p>Four brick-built creatures/droids, including the Christmas themed character and the Santa themed character. These are superb and one is going to be very suitable for adding to a certain UCS set.</p>

<p>Three tiny diorama scenes. One is great, one is OK and one is well built but not particularly characterful. Still, it might look nice next to previous years&#39; scenes. Even if you don&#39;t like it, it shows what you can build&nbsp;that scale without tonnes of expensive pieces.</p>

<p>Nine ships/vehicles of various scales. All are good to excellent. One is a little fragile but still a lovely build of a quirky ship. One took me a second to work out what it was supposed to be until I realised the instructions showed the back of it. Turned around it&#39;s a lovely model!</p>

<p>Almost all the models and figures are great, and most have not appeared in Advent Calendars before. The ones that are repeated are good for army-building. There is a great part selection including some very useful and rare pieces, with the usual array of spare small pieces. Everything in the set stands alone and there are no classic pairs or conflicts. Every era and most movies are represented, except for (SORT OF SPOILER ALERT) the two non-trilogy movies. There is nothing special from any TV shows or other media.</p>

<p>Overall a very good advent calendar, especially on sale.</p>
