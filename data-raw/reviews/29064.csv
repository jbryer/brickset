"CityIsAwesomne","2019-12-24T11:38:07.223Z","Underwhelming At Best","<p>Lego city advent calendars just really seem to be going downhill nowadays, aren&#39;t they? This is my ninth year getting a lego advent calendar and like always I stick with Lego City. I&#39;ve always been excited about these because thet always offer something reallistic that you can play with, instead of the usual fantasy themes in Star Wars or Harry Potter. But nothing lasts forever, like awesomeness. The good old days of great lego city advent calendars comes to an end sooner or later and that has happened.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll say that this isn&#39;t a terrible calendar. It&#39;s still fairly fun and I do recommend it, at least to those who are new to lego city calendars. I&#39;d not recommend for those who have been getting these calendars for ages because it will disappoint you for reasons I&#39;m going to disclose here below.</p>

<p>Pros first, the minifigure collection and pieces found in the calendar are about as good as they can get. I usually am excited about minifigures in these calendars but this calendar takes the cake for most original minifigures. Part of why is the pieces. These are some of the most unique pieces I&#39;ve ever found in lego and it&#39;s the first time I get a lot of them. For example, the eskimoo minifigure has two faces, both nothing I&#39;ve seen before. The woman with a camera has a super rare torso and scarf and a very rare hat, all are my first ones, and so on. These are just examples. There are loads of minifigures in this specific calendar, more than usually. So you can kinda see that the minifigures are my favourite part of the calendar.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the pros stop there. Minfigures are not the most important part of an advent calendar, that goes to the builds. That&#39;s what this calendar fails at. The second half was slightly better and more original than the first half though. But seriously, a stump, lego friends catapult,&nbsp; generic snowman and a poor ice fort is enough for me to be turned off (not sexually).</p>

<p>Although despite that, the builds that are good, are actually quite original. For example, curling. This is not a spoiler as they are shown on the front cover. That was quite a nice addition as we&#39;ve never seen anything like that before. And a lot of the builds in the second half had more of an original and cool theme than the first half. But overall, the negative builds weight out the positives ones, sadly.</p>

<p>The playabilty level ain&#39;t too bad though. As I said, there were actually a handful of positive builds that are really original and even the unoriginal builds..., do offer some playabilty. They actually quite pushed the playabilty level far in this calendar.</p>

<p>The price is alright. It&#39;s expensive but every other lego city calendar has this and it turns out rewarding and satisfying, even in this calendar, depsite the underwhelmingness this one bears. Overall the minifigures were quite original and nice to get, and half of the builds were decent, the other half just bad. It all offers a handful of playabilty though luckily with a decent price. Overall as you can see, I&#39;m divided on this one so the overall score&#39;d be <strong>3/5 </strong>or<strong> 6/10</strong>.</p>
