<p>Wasn&#39;t too impressed to find that Ethan would be driving his scooter blind!&nbsp; A solid black visor!&nbsp; Would you be able to see through that?&nbsp; I swopped it for a trans black one instead.</p>

<p>I was delighted to see that there was a loo roll in the loo.&nbsp; Of the sets that I have done in the past I don&#39;t recall a loo roll being included.&nbsp; Full marks to the designer who decided to include that most essential of items.&nbsp; The loo was a tad cramped though, not much manoeuvering&nbsp;room in there.</p>

<p>I really liked the colour combinations for this set.&nbsp; Toffee, bright light or cool yellow and white worked well together. There was a part that I hadn&#39;t seen before - window arch 38583/6278396 in white. At the moment it only appears to be available in white or tan.&nbsp; I do hope Lego will expand the colour range for this part, it could be useful&nbsp;addition for those who make MOCs.</p>

<p>I decided to swop the yellow headlight brick on page 81 section 64 for a white one. I felt that the yellow one provided didn&#39;t quite go with the cool yellow. That was a personal preference, others may be happy to keep the one provided.</p>

<p>I was slightly puzzled as to why there was one lone 1x6&nbsp;orange plate.&nbsp; When I discovered where it went in the build I swopped it for a red one.&nbsp; Once the other stuff has been made you cannot see this piece at all.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t encounter any difficulties in making this set.&nbsp; For me it was quite a straightforward build.&nbsp; I wasn&#39;t quite sure what the green plant thing was that is made at Section 79 page 96. It didn&#39;t look like anything I was familiar with.</p>

<p>I thought using purple ice cream scoops for bunches of grapes was good.&nbsp; I actually moved the green plant element forward one so that the grapes hung over the roof edge better.&nbsp; I also intend to add another two at the back and have bought the necessary parts to do so.&nbsp; I feel it adds that little finishing touch and covers the roof a little better.</p>

<p>All in all a really great set and I would recommend buying this.</p>
