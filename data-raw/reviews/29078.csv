"Minifig290","2019-10-11T21:10:51.357Z","Sparkle Babies!!! Could I Say Anything Else?","<p>Long time no see, hello all today im going to review and set that is selling out extremely fast the LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part 70847 Good Morning Sparkle Babies! that was released recently in the last wave of the theme for just &pound;8.99/$9.99 with 50 pieces and a price per part of 18p/20c.</p>

<p>This set is the only set to include Sparkle Babies but also has a catapult build and a Emmet and Lucy minifigure and some accessories. Lets take a look at this great set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Included in this set are 2 minifigures and two babies:</p>

<p>Emmet is an exclusive version with a new double sided print for his face showing him smiling and slightly winking his right eye on one side and him smiling with both eyes shut out of happiness. Though his orange and silver construction outfit and his brown hair is the same he has used for all the other sets in included in.</p>

<p>Lucy (formerly known as Wyldstyle) like Emmet is an exclusive variant again with a new double sided face showing here smiling with eyes open and the other side showing smiling with her eyes shut. Her clothing is a fairly uncommon print only being in 4 sets along with here light blue hair with magenta highlights which is a great piece to get in a cheaper set.</p>

<p>Included in this set are two exclusive Sparkle Babies both highly detailed on in pink and the other in turquoise, the pink baby has silver sparkles and a darker pink lightening bolt on her torso and a face that reminds me of David Bowie with a pink lightening bolt down the side of its face. The turquoise baby has the same sparkle design but has a pink star with silver lines around it on its torso, the babies face has a turquoise star around its left eye.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>There are three accessories included for the figures to hold such as two feeding bottles which are identical using unprinted lavender 1x1 round bricks with a transparent stamp piece on top, but there is also an exclusive 2x2 tile with a print for the album with &quot;A POPULAR BAND&quot; with an image of Lucy with 3 other singers and &quot;EVERYTHING IS AWESOME&quot; printed above their picture.</p>

<p><strong>Star &amp; Build</strong></p>

<p>To go along with the Sparkle Babies is a star that has few features for this set, the star uses the star plate ,introduced earlier this year, with a 2x2 printed tile for a face on top.</p>

<p>There are two, two piece builds to add onto the star; a 1x1 hinge plate with a 1x1 plate on top that goes on the anti-stud of the star piece so on of the Sparkle Babies can ride the star. There is also a 2x2 round plate with a 2x2 round inverted dome that can also go underneath so the star can be fired out of the main build, a catapult.</p>

<p>Now, this catapult build is a very simple build with a dark gray spade connected to a technic 1x2 brick by a pin, 1x1 round stud with hole and a clip piece that allow it to tilt up and throw the star. Surrounding the cannon are a few plants and flowers that add a lot of colour such as two bright leave parts, one in dark pink the other in orangy yellow, that clip from the side of the cannon, there is also a blue and purple plant sticking form the back of the build,orange leaf with teeth part in the ground.</p>

<p>____________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>I am overall impressed with this small inexpensive set and i can see why its selling out ridiculously fast, I love all the included characters such as those cute Sparkle Babies. The set is worth every penny and i believe will be sough after once its retired.</p>

<p>I&#39;d definitely recommend this set to anyone who is wanting a little set to play with or display, also it has some great parts so MOC builders would enjoy some parts included.The &pound;8.99/$9.99 makes it a cheap set and easy to buy and would make a great stocking filler this Christmas.</p>

<p><strong>Pros - </strong>Great value, fantastic figures, Sparkle Babies, nice exclusive parts</p>

<p><b>Cons - </b>Availability in big name stores as most have sold out</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-02-06T13:24:41.103Z","A Finale Scene Brought to Life.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #70847 Good Morning Sparkle Babies!:</b> Welcome to another brand new day in the Sys-Tar System restored Apocalypseberg. Or something to that effect, this little set is basically a battle pack from The LEGO Movie 2 and apparently it&rsquo;s retiring this year despite being a Summer Wave release. Is it worth picking up? I believe so.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The LEGO Movie 2 seems to have suffered in the sales department. Ever since its release in February it has failed to meet expectations, as a matter of fact many sets have been deep discounted at the end of this year (2019) and will be retired, and part of the reason for this isn&rsquo;t just the movie. No, it might also be the packaging design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I like this packaging design, it&rsquo;s very impressive and a nice evolution of the original LEGO Movie packaging design, with dark purple and a star field visible instead of the blue colouring of the original packaging. Unfortunately it is a tad on the blandish side. It does a great job showcasing the sets, but it doesn&rsquo;t look exciting enough in package. Nothing like the Hidden Side sets which have also had a hard time selling, but have a very imaginative and interesting package design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual for this set is a single small manual that has not been folded. Typically I&rsquo;m used to seeing them folded in half, that is not the case here, and the manual does a great job showing the build instructions.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">For a small set there aren&rsquo;t a whole lot of parts, heck at 50 pieces in the entire set I&rsquo;m surprised, this thing could have fit inside a Polybag if it wanted. There are some orange and pink/maroon looking plant elements and some other elements from LEGO Friends, the teal bulb elements used for flower petals. Ah yes, and one very collectible printed tile piece with the album cover for Everything is Awesome.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Emmet: Unique facial print for this set, the torso is the same as we&rsquo;ve seen in past LEGO Movie 2 sets, but the head features two unique prints, a large cheerful smile on one side and an eyes closed really happy smile on the other. Everything else is the same faded and torn construction uniform he&rsquo;s worn since we were first introduced to this version of the character. He comes with a baby bottle built out of a cylinder and eye stalk piece. (Or whatever those things used in the Daleks are called.) Kind of odd not to just use the baby bottle accessory, but perhaps this buildable bottle is more accurate to the film.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Lucy: Torso and hair are shared between other sets with Lucy, but as with Emmet she features a unique to this set head piece with dual-sided print. One side has her closed eyes smiling happily while the other features an open eyed open-mouthed happy smile showing that, once again, Everything is Awesome. She also carries a buildable baby bottle and the printed tile of her record album with the song title on the front she gave to Emmet at the end of the movie.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Sparkle Babies: Using the LEGO Baby torso and head, these two Minifigures include unique printing and are color coded. The boy is in blue with a sparkly star print on his torso and a matching symbol over one eye. The girl is in pink and has lightning bolt patterns everywhere. Both of them are super cute, and either of them can ride on the back of the Star with a few extra pieces attached for just this reason.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Star: This is the same character we&rsquo;ve seen in previous sets using a printed tile and a unique star shaped brick this character build is fun and cute and oversaturated. There are enough Stars in The LEGO Movie 2 to build your own constellation.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build &amp; completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">What you build in this set is criminally small and criminally irritating. I mean, I get it, the set is meant to be like a Battle Pack, but the model here is just utterly wasted. Basically it involves a small scenery model with a really goofy gimmick. You attach a Minifigure Shovel to a clip and hide it under the donut piece, then once you put the circle tile inside and place a Sparkle Baby on it you can smash the shovel to send the baby flying.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Sounds horrible doesn&rsquo;t it? What&rsquo;s worse is you detach the face off of Star and fit the Baby on top of it. What a terrible idea for a play feature, I&rsquo;m not even sure why LEGO did it, because I don&rsquo;t recall this being featured in the movie, but maybe the Sparkle Baby was riding on a Star while flying, so maybe that&rsquo;s what they were going for.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set should have been included with a larger build, I feel like it could have been combined with another set celebrating the finale of The LEGO Movie 2. As it stands this set is just terrible, 14$ for four Minifigures, a character built out of bricks and a small little useless model with a poorly executed play feature. You&rsquo;re really buying this set for the figures and LEGO knows it, so wait for a sale, or better yet, toss it into an order through LEGO when you use your VIP points to get it for free. Somewhat Recommended for the Figures.</p>

"Lego_fan_","2020-01-18T14:20:13.587Z","Sparkle babies.","<p>Lego set #70847 is the perfect addition to any Lego collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set comes with two Minifigures; Emmet, Lucy, (wild style) a star figure, and two sparkle babies; a blue and a pink one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Emmet figure in this set is the tattered print version and is just like every other Emmet except for the fact that his second face is him smiling with his eyes shut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lucy (wild style) is nothing exclusive here but she has her purple and blue hair, and a nice smiling face as well.</p>

<p>The star figure is cute and is not exclusive to this set aside from his or her clip that is a baby saddle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The babies are exclusive to this set and have cute faces with face paint on them which match their pajamas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build itself is very small and includes some cool looking alien like plants. It can also shoot the star in the air when you press down on the shovel. This set also includes an exclusive Popular band tile, and some drink cups.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall i think this set is a very cool addition to any collection and is great for anybody who likes Lego babies, or loves the Lego movie 2.</p>
