From the figures, to the build , the price and amazing value , it was an absolute joy receiving this set as a gift.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p><strong>MetalBeard:</strong>&nbsp;The build for MetalBeard was fun and interesting putting together. You just see how the colorful pieces come together to make a fun and musical party MetalBeard. He has&nbsp;a trumpet&nbsp;on his&nbsp;left&nbsp;arm that is removable, you can try to make him hold it with his other hand&nbsp;to make it look like he&#39;s playing the trumpet that&#39;s really fun to do.&nbsp;He has record player on one shoulder and a purple jewel on the other. At the back , he has a flag pole and half a seashell , which is some fun part usage. His right arm has a regular hand with good articulation for the fingers and the whole arm in general, using some mini ball joints for the arm&nbsp;, along with the other. Below MetalBeard&#39;s head is a printed 1 by 4 printed tile of piano keys and he has hook hands to play them which was a really fun detail. Below the piano keys is his golden chest in which has his organs as seen with most MetalBeards. He has a great peg leg that has a diamond to the end of it and his other leg, is indeed a piano, using another useful piano key print. The legs are easily poseable as they&#39;re connected with a mini ball joint, and he could still stand on the piano leg itself without tipping over. The back looks complete&nbsp;as well, not showing any anti studs which is always a plus. Overall, a very different and fun variant of the character that&#39;s designed very well.</p>

<p><strong>The Dance Floor, Speaker and Bottle Table Builds:</strong>&nbsp;These little builds&nbsp;work as cute little side builds that are very simple in design and appearance but still sets the scene for a party.</p>

<h2>The Minifigs</h2>

<p><strong>Benny:</strong><strong> </strong>He&#39;s easily&nbsp;my favorite part of the set, he has&nbsp;a new star glasses piece to go over his chipped helmet. He has his classic space logo on his front recolored in pink and purple with a part of a star behind it and a continuation of it for the back torso printing. his classic blue air tanks&nbsp;are present which is always nice, the dual molded&nbsp;white and blue legs are also phenomenal&nbsp;and his new and exclusive&nbsp;face prints are&nbsp;so adorable&nbsp;with&nbsp;his&nbsp;sincere&nbsp;face and a heart eyed face (presumably for when he drives his SPACESHIP!). Overall, one of my favorite minifigures from the theme, I just love it that much.</p>

<p><strong>Unikitty:&nbsp;</strong>She&nbsp;has one&nbsp;exclusive&nbsp;part to her, and that&#39;s the&nbsp;smiling expression. Her high heels ,&nbsp;glasses expression and colorful tail all come in the pop up party bus, but since this was a cheap alternative for that, it was great getting her here (also because her exclusive scarf is so cute and a soft piece to go around the neck). Overall, a great variant of Unikitty that&#39;s not entirely exclusive but a way cheaper alternative way to get her which I liked.</p>

<p>All 3 characters&nbsp;in the set have something in common, and it&#39;s the new and exclusive face prints , which is a really good&nbsp;part on Lego to go all out and give ALL the figures of the Lego Movie 2&#39;s final wave of sets exclusive and expressive face prints.</p>

<h2>Value For Money</h2>

<p>I got this set on sale as The Lego Movie&nbsp;2 sets were being sold pretty poorly and it went on sale, but if I got it for full price, it&#39;s still worth it all, for great parts ,&nbsp;figures and builds. It&#39;s one of those sets where the price perfectly fits what&#39;s included.</p>

<h2>Overall Opinion</h2>

<p>It&#39;s a perfect set on all sorts of levels. The value is really there and the quality and fun is clearly presented in this amazing &nbsp;set. As a fan of The Lego Movie 2 , this easily fits right in to my collection, and it should fit in to yours too. If you haven&#39;t bought it yet ,&nbsp;I highly encourage you to get it before it goes off shelves as it&nbsp;is retired. Experience total perfection for yourself!</p>

"guidotin","2020-07-11T21:05:57.7Z","Yet another weird set from Lego Movie series","<p>I&#39;m writing this from the perspective of a parent who bought this set at an extremely discounted price. Neither I nor my 5 y.o. daughter are&nbsp;into Lego Movie-themed sets. She watched only half of the first Movie before getting bored, and so I haven&#39;t even bothered to get&nbsp;the second. She finds the Lego Movie sets weird and never lusted for any of them -&nbsp;and I kinda share her opinions. So, if you are a Lego Movie fan, I recommend you look for another reviewer.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>My daughter quickly assembled the Unikitty, the astronaut and the smaller objects,&nbsp;and was happy enough playing just with them. When she turned the page and saw the instructions for that pirate-robot-music thing, she assigned me for the building task. Building experience was mostly bland, and when&nbsp;my daughter saw it ready, she promptly asked &quot;what&#39;s THAT?&quot;, and I couldn&#39;t say for sure. I just made up a story where the pirate (from a 1989 lego set we&nbsp;own) fell off the boat, got eaten by a shark which was then abducted by the alien version of Boney M&nbsp;and made into a cyborg.</p>

<p>Although the colour combinations are pleasant between the golden, dark grey and dark purple parts, the pirate-robot thing is very awkward to play with. The main problem is that it does not stand properly: the underside of the keyboard leg is flat, and cannot be mounted on a plate base, and the wooden leg is very small to provide decent support. The result is that it keeps falling again and again. Lame.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, my biggest complaint is with the accessories, which are a bit on the poor side. The&nbsp;music speaker is very basic, the table for the drinks is a piece taken directly from a&nbsp;1988&nbsp;space set, and the dancefloor... why is it soooo small?? Is that a solo dancefloor? What&#39;s the point? Why didn&#39;t they make this a 12x12, 16x16 or at <em>least </em>an 8x8 plate? Unforgivable.</p>

<h2>The Minifigures</h2>

<p>The set has only one &quot;proper&quot; minifigure with the astronaut - &quot;Benny&quot; - which I find very odd-looking. He has two faces, one with an open smile and the other with heart-shaped eyes that, combined with the star-shaped helmet visor and clothes makes it look like he&#39;s on ecstasy or worse. My daughter called it the &quot;wacko&quot; astrounaut, and it will soon be starring as an alien-possessed character in one of our space terror soap opera play.</p>

<p>The Unikitty is the only one I knew by name, thanks to a previous (and almost as weird) discounted set. It&#39;s my daugther&#39;s favourite, and the scarf is one of the &quot;parts&quot; that stand out the most in the set. As a grumpy parent, I see no point in having brick pieces printed with cat faces that cannot be used anywhere else.</p>

<p>The pirate only has the head and the cap as <em>de facto</em> minifigure parts, as the rest of the robot is all made of regular parts. As I said before, it can barely stand on its own if the arms and legs are misaligned, and frequently falls. By the next day, my daughter was already disassembling the pirate-thing to make use of its parts in her own builds. That&#39;s exactly why I bought it for.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>From a cold point of view, the only advantage&nbsp;of this set is the good assortment of golden parts which include three golden spyglasses, a golden treasure chest, a golden flag, and a golden seashell, along with smaller golden cones and other items. These will be perfect for building a Lego reliquary for other plays. There is also a number of&nbsp;dark purple plates and shaped parts that, although not as exclusive as the golden ones, might still be useful for building sports cars and other&nbsp;stuff in that colour. The coloured dancefloor is a nice idea poorly executed - this set should have had a much bigger dancefloor.</p>

<p>Apart from the golden parts, this set has also a few unique, specialised parts.The ones I can highlight the most are the Unikitty scarf and the two musical keyboard plates. I will probably try to build a Lego DX-7 with those plates sooner or later. However, as special as these parts may be, I do not think they alone would justify the purchase of this set.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Value&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Despite the selection of golden pieces, I believe the ppp is very poor considering its original price tag of 27,99 CAD (about 20 USD?) for less than 200 pieces. A very&nbsp;poor value in my book. That being said, I got this item on sale at an unbelievably low price - 9 CAD (about&nbsp;6 USD) at Walmart, from a clearance shelf alongside other Lego Movie sets. It seems that nobody wants these things!</p>

<h2>Overall Opinion</h2>

<p>Overall, I find the Lego Movie sets a bit too specialised in a way that they channel playing experience towards the specific events and characters of the movies, moving away from a more open and creative playing experience with more general sets. Of course, the same could be argued for several other Lego sets of the last 25 years, as&nbsp;even Town-themed sets are rather too specialised nowadays.</p>

<p>Since my daughter is not particularly a fan of the Lego movie, the only reason I bought this was for the parts. This set stood out from the clearance shelf as the least useless in terms of parts that could be extracted for other, more interesting custom builds. It is almost not worth it, even at 9 CAD, and it would have been a terrible deal at the original price tag. Maybe it will find its value in the hands of obsessed Lego fans or opportunist&nbsp;collectors 20 years from now.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">This set stuck out to me when initially revealed for it essentially just being a figure pack with a tiny bit of scenery sprinkled on top, something which I personally don&rsquo;t mind at all. I just happened to see it while shopping one day and picked it up on a whim. While I enjoyed The Lego Movie 2, I didn&rsquo;t have a huge desire to purchase many of the sets after the initial release of the film, so </span></span><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70848-1/Systar-Party-Crew"">70848: Systar Party Crew</a><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal""> was the first set from the line in quite some time that I had purchased.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Minifigures</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">While the new version of Metalbeard is the main build of this set, two of his acquaintances appear as minifigures with him. First up is an exclusive variant of the blue spaceman, Stardust Benny. He appears similar to previous incarnations but his shirt is now decorated to give more of a disco vibe with its star motif. He also has dual-molded blue and white legs that I believe are exclusive, as well as my favorite part, a pair of star-shaped glasses that attach to his helmet. They&rsquo;re just a great part all around, and my only complaint is that there wasn&rsquo;t an extra pair included. The other &ldquo;minifigure&rdquo; included is actually Unikitty, who is really a brick-built figure but she fits better here than in the Builds section. I don&rsquo;t normally love brick-built figures, let alone those with minimal articulation, but Disco Kitty is just too funny for me not to like. The boots and glasses are just perfect. Honestly I don&rsquo;t have much else to say here, but I like how her boots are made to emphasize how much taller than normal she is.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Builds</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The main focus here is the new version of Metalbeard, but there are a few little side bits that I&rsquo;ll mention here. First is the drink table, which is pretty basic. It&rsquo;s not bad but it&rsquo;s bland and I find it funny that only one of the three included characters can actually hold the drinks included. Next is the speaker, which is also a very basic build. It&rsquo;s simple but I can appreciate how the designer was able to create such a recognizable object with just four pieces. Finally we have the dance floor. I hate to shock any readers, but this part is also a very simple build. It works well enough but it would have been cool if it was large enough to fit Metalbeard, though that would have no doubt bumped up the price.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The star of the show here is of course Metalbeard himself, who is all around great. The ball joints used on him provide plenty of articulation, even if they take away from the color scheme a little bit. That&rsquo;s quite a shame too given that this version of Metalbeard has a very unique look, featuring large quantities of gold and purple parts. There are some interesting parts used on Metalbeard, namely the clam piece at the top (I think it&#39;s supposed to be feathers but I&rsquo;m not really sure) and telescope plus gem for his peg leg. The main aesthetic with this figure is music, which is incorporated in both the keyboards above his chest and on his leg, as well as in the trumpet he holds in his left hand. Overall I think Metalbeard is a nice build and I like how distinct he is from the previous variations, even if I don&rsquo;t personally own any of them.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Parts and Miscellaneous Thoughts</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">I already touched on it before, but I really love the glasses Benny comes with. The bone in Metalbeard&rsquo;s chest is a funny inclusion that I believe is present in past renditions of the character. Other than that there isn&rsquo;t much to be said, if you want some purple and pearl gold parts then this is a decent way to get some.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">In terms of the building experience, I found it to be very simple, as is to be expected of a set this size. If you&rsquo;ve ever built any other buildable figures or mechs of a similar size then you pretty much know what you&rsquo;re getting with this one. For the unenlightened, you basically just go through the side builds before doing Metalbeard&rsquo;s torso and then his limbs and trumpet. Like I said, it&rsquo;s basic but still fun.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Overall</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">For what it is, this is a fun little set. Sure, it&rsquo;s far from the most complex design ever realized in the medium of Lego bricks, and the side builds are pretty uninteresting, but you&rsquo;re buying this for the characters and on that front it more than delivers. Unikitty is a repeat but great nonetheless, the exclusive Benny is wonderful, and Metalbeard is a fun departure from his normally drab self. On the price front, the $20 MSRP seems fair for what you get, and the set&rsquo;s relative age means it&rsquo;s easy to get discounted as well. If you&rsquo;re in the market for some silly fun or colorful parts then this is a nice option for a good price. </span></span></p>
