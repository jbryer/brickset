It hadn't sold because the box was so tattered.  I was delighted to get it just because I'd always wanted the Belville mushroom, but after putting it together, I was just delighted with it.  

The tall flower, together with the arch and table pieces, gives a really nice proportion to the set as a whole.  Even the clunky Duplo flowers look cute in unusual colors, with little Belville flower plates in the center.  Then the fact that the fairy is completely jointed, with stud-grabbing feet, means you can pose her like a real fairy, instead of having to lean her against something.

Finally, you end up with charming unique pieces, including a bucket with handle, a rake, and a light green shovel.  The rare colors, the feeling of proportion, and the poseability of the figure combine to make this a great set.  With a Belville mushroom!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
