This LEGO Movie 2 set is extremely expensive and involves a very large number of characters. It&rsquo;s also on clearance right now and very well worth that kind of price, full price&hellip; I think I&rsquo;ll save that discussion for the end.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This large box shows off the set in very impressive detail. It&rsquo;s a pretty large box and all the characters inside are on the top with their names beside them so you know who is who. The front shows the set very nicely, the back includes some action shots for play features and play ideas when playing with this set. Overall a really nice box.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is large, has the usual imagery and is terrible. Several images are inconsistently printed making it difficult to follow the steps as they show a finished section of the model with parts you haven&rsquo;t used yet during the build. This makes the build slow, tedious and frustrating as you need to pay really close attention to which step you are on. I cannot believe LEGO allowed such a terrible misprint issue to be packaged in one of their sets. I have never seen a manual with so many image issues.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set includes a lot of clear blue elements, bricks, plates and ultimately the NEXO Knights shield element. There are a lot of these elements in clear blue, which is extremely useful for folks that enjoy MOCing crystal spires or the like. It&rsquo;s a very nice selection of parts, but also a very frustrating selection of parts and we&rsquo;ll discuss why in the build portion of the review.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Archimedes: This brick-built spa employee is a cat. An anthropomorphic cat dressed in a white spa robe with gold trim. The build is pretty fun and looks great. The only moveable part is the tail. No accessories to hold.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Balthazar: This Vampire Mini-Doll has a very nice cape, an impressive looking torso print and a brand new hair piece which is very well made. He has a rather bland face expression, but he can swap his head with his bat form and then you&rsquo;ll see something interesting. No accessories to be held though.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Balthazar Vampire Bat: There isn&rsquo;t much to say here, Balthazar as a bat is made out of three parts, the bat body, a Mini-Doll head and a hair piece. This figure isn&rsquo;t much, but he does include a more appropriate facial expression for a Vampire, with an open mouth showing his fangs and a slightly sinister look to his face. He makes a nice addition and could be considered a Balthazar accessory.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Benny: This version of Benny is unique to this set. While his parts are all the same as previous Benny figures, the facial expressions are unique with a goofy looking smile on one side and a relaxed open-mouthed satisfied expression. No accessories to hold, but he has no need of them when he&rsquo;s getting massaged.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Calm-Down Kitty: Another unique printed face for Unikitty in this set. The rest of the build is perfectly fine, similar to other Unikitty builds, the parts are new to the Theme, but not to this set as they are also found in a few other sets. The printed bridge element and the spiky tail.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Eight: Another Spa employee build out of bricks. This octopus only has four arms, despite being named Eight, and has studs on the end of each arm so he or she can hold onto accessories. Accessories for Eight includes a teapot and a tray with glass on it. The face is printed on a 1x2 sloped element which is just eyes. Overall a decent looking figure.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Flaminga: This wonderfully detailed character build features some very impressive design elements, the wings feature small heart shaped tiles for feather deailing and the tail uses the heart shaped plate. The wings are hinged, but cannot raise up and down. Still he or she is very capable of performing massages. The torso features a printed brick with spa robe. They look great, if a bit top heavy due to the thin legs and tiny bird-feet.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Sparkle Rinse Lucy: Unique to this set, as are all of the Minifigures, Lucy has a hair piece showing her &lsquo;natural&rsquo; hair colour which has been revealed thanks to the spa&rsquo;s relaxing tubs. Her torso and legs are printed the same as other sets which feature this look, and I think her head might be a shared print, though I&rsquo;m not 100% sure on that. She has an angry expression and a regular smile. No accessories. Since there&rsquo;s no fighting going on in the scene it makes sense that she isn&rsquo;t holding anything. Also, if I recall their equipment was removed during these scenes.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Balthazar in Vampire and Bat form begins to construct his spa by working on the side section where his revolving door is located. The build is fairly enjoyable for the most part, however due to the nature of the clear blue elements and other parts being used here I have found some issues with clutch power with this set. This section isn&rsquo;t too bad on its own, but as we continue forward ooooh boy is this build irritating. I am hereby issuing a statement, build this on a hard, flat surface and do not move the model until it is finished. Also keep a close eye on the steps, some of the images in this manual show you building things out of order, or rather the pictures are out of order as they show some sections of the model being completed while you are trying to put the pieces on and haven&rsquo;t reached that step yet.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Lucy, Benny and Archimedes start helping to build the next portion of the spa, adding our first trouble spot, one of the clear looking crystal pillars. These things are a pain, they like to pop off when you move the model around while it is unstable, and as I noted above some of the images are showing steps completed two or three sections later. It appears this manual has had numerous misprint issues.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: After building Flaminga, he or she can help build the next section of Spa with another pillar and even more irritating images out of sequence. If you&rsquo;re starting to get frustrated and confused I would recommend taking a break and maybe following a reviewer on Youtube&rsquo;s speed build slowed down to better see where the parts are meant to go. Not a really big issue if you are patient and take your time. The numerous clear blue elements for the crystals are also a bit of an issue, try to miss any parts in your build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #4: Eight is on hand, and hand, and hand to help build the rest of the central archway. This is where you really need to be paying attention, I missed a few parts and had to try and jiggle parts into place without completely tearing everything apart. I only partially succeeded in that endeavour. Seriously this build is pretty easy if you take your time and don&rsquo;t rush it, but if you find yourself getting confused because of the weird pictures they are showing I am once again seriously telling you to check out a build video on Youtube.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #5: Calm Down Kitty is here, which is great because each bag has somebody new to build, I appreciate sets which do this as it gives you new Minifigures or buildable characters to construct while working on it. This final portion of the build is for the spa tub area, it didn&rsquo;t have too many issues, but again take it slow. I can&rsquo;t believe LEGO allowed this manual to go to print with so many issues and inconsistent shots of the finished product with each build step.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Spa: This build looks great as a display piece, but I&rsquo;m not 100% behind it as a playset. There is a lot of elements that can easily pop off, accessing everything is easy and simple, but the massage table is loose. The rotating doorway is very nice, works well to swap between Bat and Human form Balthazar. And the spa tub on the other side can open up where folks can rest, relax and soak up some rejuvenating bubbles or something. No Bruce Willis was included with the set unfortunately, if anything it would have been amusing to see and make this set a must-have for that reason alone.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is a bit pricey and the unfortunate issues with the manual and the build is making it extremely difficult to recommend this set. I enjoy the look of it, and the Minifigures are very enjoyable, however I feel as though this set should be gotten on discount. And maybe the manual needs a new print. It has limited play features with a rotating door and a flipping spa pool that you can launch people out of. Overall it&rsquo;s a fairly nice looking set, however I&rsquo;d have to say only get it on sale. Slightly Recommended.</p>
