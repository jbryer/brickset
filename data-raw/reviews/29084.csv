<p>The Fire Fang, when presented, got a rather luke warm reception from many commenters. I liked the initial look, and now having built this set&nbsp;I have to say I am not disappointed at all. The build was fairly quick but interesting. The plastic elements (like the hood) are not as much of a nuisance as I thought they would be, and actually look OK.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigures, including the three Pyro bad guys are well done. The snake is quite moveable, and makes for a nice bad guy. Unfortunately, there is not much good guy stuff included in this set.</p>

<p>The final issue is the price: There are a number of pieces that arguably raise it, but as is, I think the RRP is a tad high. To me, this is a 40 euros&nbsp;worth set. If you can find it on a (slight) discount, you like Ninjago, or like evil animals, then this set IMHO is worth picking up.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The roughly 460 pieces are divided over 4 bags, where IMHO two or three would have done. Likewise, I think many children younger than 8 years old can quite easily put the Fire Fang together. The stickers are easy to apply (though as they are very visible, do take care), and the hood elements can be attached quite easily as well. The one thing that might put off younger children is the fair amount of small parts included, that provide the details of the snake.</p>

<p>I like the use of the spoiler element to represent the large scales on the bottom of the snake. The best part of the construction is discovering the clear knowledge of Lego geometry by the designer, and the skill with which he/she has used it to create a fairly fixed shape through clicking various sub assemblies (6 subassemblies, and the swooping tail) together.</p>

<p>Overall, I would say the build was fun, taking me about an hour to finish at a leisurely pace. I also like the new bad guys, which seem to be a mixture of cobra-like snake people and ancient Egyptians.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>There are four minifigures included in this set: Kai FS, Pyro Slayer, Pyro Destroyer and Aspheera. As there are currently no detailed minifigure inventories in this set, I cannot be certain, but my guess is Aspheera and Kai are unique, while the Pyro Slayer and Pyro Destroyer can be found in other sets.</p>

<p>The new bad guys seem to be some kind of zombie-mummy-on fire-snake people. Pyro Slayer and Pyro destroyer actually identical, the difference is made through their equipment. Their torsos are printed front and back, resembling a mummy-zombie (ripped and dirty bandages) on fire. It is highly detailed, well printed, quite colourful, and IMHO well done. The torso print is continued on the legs in the same style. Their heads, resembling a cobra in strike pose with flaming hood, is dual-moulded (brown with trans-orange hood), if not triple moulded (the black eyes). The head is highly detailed and IMHO looks quite evil.</p>

<p>Pyro Slayer is armed with a bronze shield and a bronze staff weapon, looking a little like a Japanese naginata. He also wears a minifigure back plate with knob. Pyro Destroyer wears a new piece of bronze shoulder armour (mini&nbsp;armour no 17), with a cobra head on each shoulder. The mould looks fairly crisp, and generally looks good. He is armed with a bronze shield and an &#39;Egyptian sword&#39;, resembling the khopesh of Ancient Egypt.</p>

<p>Kai FS is included with a spinner. His torso print is nice and includes some subtle detail. It is continued nicely on the legs. He has two facial expressions, one smirking and one somewhat peeved. He also seems to have an injury above his left eye as he has a small bandage there. As he comes with the spinner, he also wears flaming head gear.</p>

<p>Aspheera is IMHO the best minifigure of the lot. He comes with a dual moulded&nbsp;footing similar to that of the dementors in the Harry Potter series, or the yellow and blue ones from the Ninjago&nbsp;&#39;Possession&#39; subtheme, when these elements seem to have been introduced. Rather than blue and trans-yellow or black and transparent, here the mixture seems to be trans-orange and opaque light-orange/yellow-orange. His head is identical in design to that of the Pyro Slyer and Pyro Destroyer, but is dual moulded gold / trans-orange. Similarly, his shoulder armour is of the same design as that of Pyro Destroyer, but gold rather than bronze. He is armed with some kind of pole-arm with a banner (different variations of that banner are included in the set). His torso-print is very detailed showing mummy torn&nbsp;mummy-bandages on fire, but him also wearing something like a massive silvery amulet on his chest and gold necklace/neckplate (well known from Ancient Egyptian high status burials or from images of high status individuals and gods). Of course there is the issue of the transition between the ghost-pedestal and the torso, otherwise IMHO this one could be a viable candidate for mini-figure of the year.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>The Fire Fang seems to combine elements from different snake species: the hood from the cobra-family, the tail from the rattlesnakes, and the nose from the horned vipers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Personally I love the way the belly of the snake - usually larger scales in different colours - has been designed. The head of the snake is impressive, though maybe slightly undersized. The swooping tail is well designed. The stability of such animals is always somewhat problematic due to the narrow base and high centre of gravity, but is surprisingly good. I like the design of the throne, with its mixture of barbarian and oriental styles. IMHO the colour combinations of&nbsp;the snake - black, sand blue, new dark red and trans-orange - work really well. I like how the small sand blue banners are used to shape the plastic of the hood.&nbsp;The stickers and banners definitely do add to the overall looks. I also like the way the designer has turned the tail into a fearsome weapon with the sting and the stud shooters.</p>

<p>The whole pose of the snake is IMHO quite dynamic, with the designer showing a good grasp of Lego geometry; otherwise Aspeera would have been looking up at the sky rather than forward when occupying his throne.</p>

<p>There is a small stand for a small staff, which presumably can be protected by the snake or the ninja&#39;s, or can be used to &#39;awaken&#39; Fire Fang, or control it.</p>

<p>As the title of my review&nbsp;already suggests, this snake could be a perfect companion/opponent to the <strong>Ultra Dragon (set 70679)</strong> which was released at the beginning of this year as part of the Legacy wave. Where the new Ultra Dragon was not a massive step up to the original design it was inspired by in the 2012 <strong>Epic Dragon Battle (set 94950)</strong>, IMHO Fire Fang is much more impressive than the Great Devourer that was in??????cluded in that set. Similarly is the use of different techniques to get the shape of the snake.</p>

<h2>Play vs Display</h2>

<p>IMHO this snake is impressive enough to be a display piece on its own; it is big enough, well designed and &#39;finished&#39; enough, and with a fairly simple base it would do very well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a nice play set, especially when it can be combined with something from the Ninjago good guys.<strong> Lloyd&#39;s Titan Mech (set 70676)</strong> from this wave or the aforementioned Ultra Dragon would seem viable candidates. The snake itself handles well, and has a high slither-factor. The slashing tail is simple but effective.&nbsp;On its own, I can see children chasing their siblings or crawling the snake all over their parents. Or it could go all Godzilla or Great Devourer on their Lego city.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall this seems to me to be a good set, better than I expected it to be. Somehow I have been captured by its looks. IMHO it it lacks an immediate opponent to fight against, but that seems to be common in this wave (sole exception seemingly the <strong>Castle of the Forsaken Emperor (set 70678)</strong>. Something like Lloyd&#39;s Titan Mech or the Ultra Dragon seem its &#39;natural&#39; opponent. And in fact, combining either of the two with Fire Fang costs about the same (one-on-one) for the former, and slightly more for the latter than the original Epic Dragon Battle. Adjust for inflation, and you end up (arguably) with something cheaper.</p>

<p>The designer has IMHO done a very good job in creating an impressive angry snake. The four included minifigures are nice, though maybe 5 would have been better. The RRP is a tad high. If you can find this set for 40 euros or less, one should definitely consider picking it up.</p>
