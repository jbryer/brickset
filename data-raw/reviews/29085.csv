I don&#39;t usually buy mechs, but this one has such a striking appearance, so I ordered it too, with other new Ninjago sets.</p>

<h2><strong>The minifigures</strong></h2>

<p>6 minifigs is the perfect amount for such set. As always I am amazed by the job LEGO does detailing the minifigs: the prints are filled with tiny details, the newer molds for armor and helmets are so good, that each&nbsp;minifig looks like a little piece of art.</p>

<p>Zane has a new dual-molded half-translucent&nbsp;helmet, and he can use a Spinjitzu cone, which is really good: dual-molded too, however, this one doesn&#39;t have mixed-in glitter inside (like some cones in other sets), it&#39;s just transparent.</p>

<p>Lloyd is in his green outfit, wielding a golden sword. He also gets a katana, which is neatly placed in a holder.</p>

<p>As the opposing force, the set features a squad of &quot;Blizzard&nbsp;soldiers&quot; I believe, led by General Vex. And again, I cannot express enough, how much do I love the amount of dual-molding with translucent plastic, that LEGO does nowadays. The shoulder armour, which has ice crystals &quot;growing&quot; from it, the samurai style helmet with ice too, they look stunning. General can use a blue katana (so many katanas in this set!) or a spear with a flag (we get 3 different flags to choose). The face and body prints look like General&nbsp;is covered with ice. He has quite a menacing face.</p>

<p>The Blizzard warrior has a similar outfit and armor, but different head. The Blizzard sword master has a stylish cloak and a hat. His head is transparent blue. And finally, the Blizzard archer, with his shoulder plate, a crossbow and an ordinary samurai helmet.</p>

<h2><strong>The parts</strong></h2>

<p>The variety of the pieces is very good, the set is a treasure for anyone, who likes to get more different parts in different colors. I can&#39;t be sure, but I suppose some pieces might be in colors they have never been before. However, there aren&#39;t any fully new pieces, except the Zane&#39;s Spinjitzu cone and the large golden shuriken.</p>

<h2><strong>The build</strong></h2>

<p>Assembling the mech was quite time consuming, in a good way. You have to build many things twice, for the arms, legs, shoulders, etc, but it isn&#39;t boring at all, because when you are building, you become amazed by the genius of the designer. I could see so many thoughtful decisions and&nbsp;so many perfect connections!</p>

<p>Every angle is perfect, every piece is in its place. The most interesting part was building the chest plate, and when I put the two small golden wing pieces (which can be seen on the pictures, on the chest), I just couldn&#39;t undestand, how, just how the designer or designers came up with such perfectly fitting position for them, as it&#39;s something absolutely not obvious at all.</p>

<h2><strong>The completed model &amp; playability</strong></h2>

<p>The first thing I&#39;d like to mention is the color scheme. I am a big fan of sand-green, and there&#39;s so much of it! This is truly a thing of beaty to behold. And there are so many small details, making it look even better. Again, I praise the designer or designers&nbsp;for their job, as they left nearly no places which aren&#39;t covered with something good looking. They even cared to cover the large Technic joints on the hips! The mech looks awesome from any angle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only exception for this is the back, there are some exposed Technic liftarms, which make the body sturdy, and are also used to connect a flyer machine with transparent green winglets. The flyer is pretty good by itself, and has two projectile shooters. The mech is armed with a sword and a spinning shuriken.</p>

<p>The model is very sturdy, the arms have a good range of motion, you can move them in shoulders, elbows and you can clench fingers to hold the sword (you can detach it anytime). There are no knee joints, as usual for mechs, and the feet aren&#39;t very movable. But you can move the whole leg back and forth, and also to the corresponding side.</p>

<p>The head looks a lot like samurai helmet, and you can lift it up to put a pilot inside. For controls, he has two printed consoles. Also, we get 8 identical printed pieces for the shoulders (which you can move too). The set doesn&#39;t rely too much on stickers, the sticker sheet is small, and I like that most of the details are done &quot;in bricks&quot;, rather than with stickers.</p>

<h2><strong>Overall</strong></h2>

<p>Lloyd&#39;s Titan Mech, in my opinion, is one of the best looking mechs LEGO ever made. Almost everything is perfect about it, however, I find it a bit pricey. I would recommend it to anyone, who likes mechs, and/or Ninjago. If you are in doubt, to get or not to get this set - I would say, definitely get it, you will not be disappointed!</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lloyd&#39;s Titan Mech is the one big mech included in the 2019 Ninjago summer wave, based on the Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitzu story line. It is also the third biggest set of the wave. Personally, I think this is one of the bigger mechs, if not the biggest &#39;normal&#39;&nbsp;Ninjago mech to date (including the Lego Ninjago Movie). The build itself is fun, and I like the way the mech comes together, and how the designer has made use of various parts, like the small wings.</p>

<p>There is a nice selection of minifigures - 6 in total - with only Zane FS being truly unique to this set. The mech itself has decent posability, with the knees (as usual) being fixed. A small flying machine is hitched to the back, and this play feature is well integrated in the design. Most of the mech is also quite solid, though the center wing of each &#39;trident&#39; of wings does come off quite easily.</p>

<p>Of course there is the issue of price. Its price per part is good (well under 0.10 euro per part), and in line, of not on the cheaper end of that of previous Ninjago mechs. If you like mechs or Ninjago this is definitely a set worth considering. If you can find it for a discount, IMHO it becomes a good buy.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>For some reason, this set is listed as a 9+ build. I honestly cannot fathom why. IMHO many younger children will be able to build this set. The sole reason why I can see the age range being so high is because there is some Lego Technic included in the instruction, and there are numerous joints/hinges that need to be &#39;clicked&#39; together. I did not come across extremely difficult sequences, very delicate construction, or tediousness which might putt off some children. There are some stickers that definitely add to the looks of the mech, but again, not too many and IMHO nothing too difficult to apply.</p>

<p>One starts with building Lloyd&#39;s flying machine, which is fairly quick and simple. Next up is the construction of the upper body of the mech, which is stiffened by Technic bars and connectors. Very quickly one can enjoy some clever techniques used to shape the torso.</p>

<p>The legs are sturdy, with the &#39;knee-bend&#39; provided by Technic bars. The feet provide a stable base for the mech in various poses.&nbsp; The arms consist of fairly simple upper and lower arms, again allowing&nbsp;quite a bit of articulation. I like the use of the tire rims. The final details to build are the shoulder armour (with printed curved slopes!) and the &#39;helmet&#39;.</p>

<p>It took me around 90 minutes to finish the mech, at a fairly leisurely pace. Part of the reason for that is the relatively small number of parts in a single bag, and there being quite a bit of brick-stacking.</p>

<h2>The minifigures</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, there are six minifigures in this set. None of the bad guys seems to be unique, unlike&nbsp;Zane FS and Lloyd.</p>

<p>For the four bad guys, one set of legs, two different torsos and three different heads have been created. The Blizzard Sword Master and Blizzard Archer share a torso, as do General Vex and the Blizzard Warrior, while the Blizzard Archer and Blizzard Warrior share a head (with two sided print). Likewise, there seem to be two colours for the same (new?) helmet and armour design: gun metal and dark red.</p>

<p>The torso prints are well detailed, though on one there seems to be a partial issue with the red bleeding through the white print a bit. That said, it is not something that is really noticeable or distracting from the overall print. The torso of General Vex and the Blizzard Warrior have a little more subtle detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The helmet and armour pieces for General Vex and Blizzard Warrior are dual moulded, and well designed. I like them. Blizzard Archer has a bit of shoulder armour, which seems to be a recolour of an existing piece. Blizzard Sword Master wears a hat and tattered&nbsp;cape.</p>

<p>I like the general expressions of the face prints, especially that of Blizzard Sword Master (angry face and braid on the back of a transblue head) and General Vex, with his sideburns. One of the faces of Blizzard Archer and Blizzard Warrior shows them hit in the face with a snow ball.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bad guys are armed with ice blue katanas, a crossbow, and something looking like a naginata for General Vex.</p>

<p>Zane FS has a dualmoulded&nbsp;cowl&nbsp;and a nice print on the legs and torso. Lloyd has two face prints (determined and smirking). Almost the&nbsp;same minifigure can also be found in Lloyd&#39;s Journey (set 70671), seemingly the only difference being Lloyd wearing a cowl in this set, and a hair piece in Lloyd&#39;s Journey. I like the well (and subtly) detailed print on the torso and legs.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Overall, IMHO this is a very good looking mech. My first impression is that it resembles a Transformers/Samurai hybrid. It has size, and I like the consistent colour combination of white and sand green, with details in gold. The looks also fit that of an arctic environment, including the feet looking a bit like snow boots.</p>

<p>The ugly parts of the construction (like the Technic knees and off-colour pieces) are well covered. The snow boots are shaped in such a way as to prevent the mech from leaning to far forward or backward. This allows for a fairly wide stance of the mech.&nbsp;&nbsp;The mech itself is armed with a sword (fixed in place by a Technic cross-pin) in the right hand a shuriken spinner on&nbsp;the left lower arm.</p>

<p>I also like the look of the mech with Lloyd seated in place. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be a place to store Lloyd&#39;s sword.</p>

<p>The flyer seems to be a bit of a mixture of a jetski with bird wings.When fixed to the mech it looks somewhat like a halo, and definitely makes the whole machine more impressive. The flyer has two well integrated spring-loaded shooters.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>Overall, I think this set is as much a play as a display set. The flyer adds a play feature on its own, enhanced by the spring-loaded shooter. The articulation of the legs and arms helps as well, and so does the way the sword can be fixed in the hand (to prevent it from falling out during play). Unfortunately, the wings of the flyer are somewhat delicate.</p>

<p>The mech is well finished enough to make for a nice display piece, especially with the flyer attached. Then it even looks ok from the rear. IMHO it works well as a stand-alone piece or as part of a mech line-up.</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, I think is a good set. The mech is big, stable, and looks good. All but the middle flyer wing is also very sturdy.&nbsp;There are a good number of minifigures included, and the flyer provides an extra play feature. Even the RRP is acceptable, and becomes very good if one looks for a discount. If you like mechs or Ninjago, IMHO one should definitely consider getting this set.</p>
