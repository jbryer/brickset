This is clearly the flagship set, or should I say, the landship? I own a couple of previous Bounty sets, the largest ones, and you can see a lot of common with&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.brickset.com/sets/70738-1/Final-Flight-of-Destiny-s-Bounty"" target=""_blank"">70738: Final Flight of Destiny&#39;s Bounty</a>, (the color scheme especially) and the sails are almost the same as for&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.brickset.com/sets/70618-1/Destiny-s-Bounty"">70618: Destiny&#39;s Bounty</a>. So let&#39;s get started.</p>

<h2><strong>The minifigures</strong></h2>

<p>The set features 9 minifigs, which is perfect, and they look fantastic as usual. The ninjas wear their own colors, as always, and the Serpentines have new &quot;desert&quot; style outfits.</p>

<p>Wu got himself a new cloak, which is made from soft fabric, not with that stiff material that LEGO usually uses for cloaks. I find it great, because it looks a lot more natural and realistic, and it doesn&#39;t crumple so easily, as the stiff ones. As for the outfit, he wears a kimono with golden dragon print on the back. His love for tea continues in this set too, and he&#39;s got a cup and a teapot.</p>

<p>Nya and Jay look similar, with Nya&#39;s black and blue and Jay&#39;s mostly blue outfits. Jay has a couple of funny printed badges, and both of them have shoulder armor with weapon holder. They have alternative faces for the heads.</p>

<p>Kai, dressed in red, is almost the same too, with some small bags printed on the chest, shoulder armor and a second face too.</p>

<p>Cole has a little more interesting clothes, with new dual-molded helmet, which has translucent top, looking like flames. His outfit is mostly black, with ripped off sleeves, and he&#39;s got a funny printed bag for food on his back. There are a fork and a spoon printed on it. Cole has a second face as well. And he can use a Spinjitzu cone, which is new for this Ninjago summer. It&#39;s a really well-done piece, and I&#39;m glad to receive another one with this set, as well as with other sets. This cone is trans-orange with mixed in glitter, which looks very nice and beautiful, especially in the light.</p>

<p>The ninjas have a really wide selection of close combat weapons, as LEGO is generous for such pieces in modern sets, as always.</p>

<p>The Serpentines are only 4, opposing to 5 good guys. But they have 2, I&#39;d say, &quot;high officers&quot;, which should even the chances.</p>

<p>The first one is Aspheera, who gets a jinn-style lower part, instead of legs or tail. It looks marvelous, with two colors of transparent and non-transparent plastic. The upper body part is a burning armor with some kind of tunic. There&#39;s also a golden shoulder armor piece with snake heads. Aspheera has a golden snake head, and can use a spear with a flag (we get 3 different plastic flags to place on it).</p>

<p>The next &quot;high officer&quot; is Char, with long rubber tail. He also wears golden shoulder armor and is armed with a staff, holding 2 small snakes.</p>

<p>The two remaining Serpentines have snake heads too, but no tails, just legs. Their bodies have nice prints with burning&nbsp;clothes. They can use shields and swords.</p>

<h2><strong>The parts</strong></h2>

<p>With this set we receive a lot of really good parts. The whole model consists of very different pieces, which is good, because there aren&#39;t a lot of places where the same part appears many times. It&#39;s also great, that the set doesn&#39;t rely too much on any large pieces, there are only 3 big &quot;ship hull&quot; pieces, and the new golden wheel discs. Also the golden shurikens and the mentioned Spinjitzu cone are entirely new.</p>

<p>We don&#39;t get a lot of Technic parts, their selection is quite limited here.</p>

<p>The most notable pieces for me are the golden exhaust pipes, the windscreens and a couple of decorated &quot;fence&quot; pieces.</p>

<h2><strong>The build</strong></h2>

<p>Assembling the set was actually quicker, than I expected. It isn&#39;t bad at all, I didn&#39;t get tired and built the set in one go. The build is straightforward, without any noticeable complexity, except a couple of places, where some attention is needed: constructing the turning mechanism for the front wheels (which is really simple, without any gears, but very effective), and for the retracting turbines for the detachable flyer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We build the Bounty from the bottom to the top, adding small details along the way. I&#39;ve enjoyed it a lot, it was relaxing, without repetitiveness, despite the set being symmetrical.</p>

<h2><strong>The completed model &amp; playability</strong></h2>

<p>For me, the Land Bounty looks stunning, but it turned out to be a little smaller than I imagined. But I think it looks even better than the pictures, so it compensates. I like the massive front grille with thick blades, I like the red line, following through the whole vehicle. It has 2 identical windscreens,one behind the grille, another on the top, which are tilted forward (they are actually regular windscreen pieces, just flipped upside down). The vehicle looks like a large land ship, the sails strengthen the impression.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The top part of the Land Bounty serves as a bridge and as a detachable flying machine. It just sits there, connected to a couple of studs, and you can remove it at any time. Pressing Technic levers on its back will make 2 large engines&nbsp;to move to the sides.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can open a hatch on top of the flyer (which actually consists of 3 parts), and place someone inside, or leave a pilot just on top, because there&#39;s a large steering wheel. The flyer has 2 stud shooters on the sides, and overall looks good by itself, except that exposed Technic levers on the back.</p>

<p>The top deck of the Bounty itself is quite empty, with a turnable cannon in the center and a tiny bonsai tree in the front. I also find the inner sides of the boards not really good looking, as they are the bottom sides of the pieces. But that&#39;s not a big deal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s see what&#39;s going on inside. You can access the inner compartment by removing the flyer and the plates with the cannon. starting from the front windscreen, we got the control room for 2 drivers, with a steering wheel, gear shift lever, and a small printed console. Behind the control room there&#39;s a nicely built arcade machine and a tiny stove for Wu&#39;s teapot. Next, we got 2 identical weapon holders, where you can place some of your weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then there&#39;s just an empty corridor, leading to 2 round entrances on the sides. The inside of the corridor is half occupied by a retractable turret&nbsp;platform. It&#39;s built on Technic liftarms, and you can lift it up by turning a gear on the side of the vehicle. There are 2 projectile shooters on a turntable on this turret. It&#39;s completely invisible from the outside (well, visible if you look into the entrances), and it cannot be lifted when the flyer is sitting on the vehicle.</p>

<p>And finally, behind the turret is a small room for a tiny quad bike. Despite of it being very small, I&#39;d say it&#39;s a nice model and it doesn&#39;t look like it was made without proper thinking with leftover pieces. It&#39;s a good little vehicle.</p>

<p>The Land Bounty doesn&#39;t have a lot of small details, but I think it doesn&#39;t need to. There are only a couple of fancy decorations, and it mostly look cool and powerful. Now, I was so surprised by the sticker sheet! It&#39;s so small, for such a large set! Some stickers are even used inside, so it&#39;s even fewer of them outside!</p>

<p>I can&#39;t express enough, how much I love turning wheels in LEGO sets, and I always appreciate any set, that has such feature. The Land Bounty exceeds the expectations, by not only having the turning mechanism, but also having this mechanism turn the front wheels and the middle wheels, with the middle wheels turning less, than the front ones. It looks great and it is effective for playing. I absolutely love this. Turning the wheels is smooth and feels nice, the knob is located at the back.</p>

<p>There are 2 golden shurikens on the sides, which are just hanging there. They both have small wheels with rubber tires, which roll on a surface and make the shurikens spin. It works mostly fine, on a carpet or on the floor, or mostly anywhere, except bumpy surfaces, where the small wheels aren&#39;t able to touch the ground all the time.</p>

<h2><strong>Overall</strong></h2>

<p>I like the Land Bounty, I like it a lot. It&#39;s quite a displayable set, but it has a lot of great play features and is really well-designed. It&#39;s sturdy, it&#39;s something that you want to take for a ride, something you want to play with. However, the price is quite high, I&#39;d suggest to wait for a sale or discount. But I am definitely recommending this set as another well-done LEGO Ninjago&nbsp;vehicle.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>
