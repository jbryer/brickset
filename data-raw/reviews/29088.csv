<p>Lego Ideas has once again brought out a set that embodies what Lego is all about: reminiscing on one&#39;s childhood. The Flintstones is an iconic TV show from the 1960&#39;s, making any adult who sees this model excited about how impressive in detail everything is. The original concept constructed by Andrew Clark, previous designer of the Ideas Doctor Who set, captured&nbsp;all aspects of the show that made everyone that watched it so happy. I am truly amazed at how well the Lego designers encapsulated all elements of a complex building into a beautiful display piece for any to bear witness to.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>What I enjoyed about the set:&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>The construction of the roof on the actual house itself was truly a remarkable piece of Lego engineering. Every other bag of the model essentially built up, pun intended, with&nbsp; the various techniques displayed to depict a sleek, yet sophisticated process to construct the roof. It is very stylistic of not only the era of the show, but also how efficient the Lego designers were in this model. In fact, I prefer the entirety of the house and car over the original model made by Mr. Clark. The roof adds the necessary detail for the lifestyle that the Flintstones&nbsp;family portrayed in their chaotic lives.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>The Flintstones family car utilized a variety of building techniques that made for a very sturdy vehicle. Though the car is not a traditional build as many other typical cars that Lego produces, the Ideas designers used the interpretation from the original designer to revolutionize new building processes for future vehicles. The process was very simplistic, yet the vehicle is very robust and can hold all the minifigures, which is very uncommon for many traditional Lego vehicles. The &quot;wheels&quot; are truly one of a kind and are useful for future builds of steam-rollers for fans of Lego. Though, the one drawback is the car is harder to move on surfaces with very little traction such as tile. This one drawback does not deter from the eye-catching prominence of this separate build.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>What I disliked about the set:</strong></h2>

<ul>
	<li>I would have liked for the set designers to incorporate the dinosaurs and other important characters, especially Dino the family pet, in the final model. Andrew Clark did an impeccable job recreating Dino through Lego pieces and creating a unique piece for the head of the dinosaur. I understand that Lego wanted to make this set much more affordable for all fans of Lego, but it would have been perfectly fine to&nbsp; increase the price by $5 to allow for Dino to be in the set, due to his significance in the series. I do find it ironic that the designers made an excuse to not have an extra figure in the set by stating Dino was missing on the TV set. Very humorous on Lego&#39;s part and effective Easter Egg for the model.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>With the overall playability of the set, I felt like it severely lacked some aspects of actions and/or more modules within the set itself. The designers spent too much energy on aesthetics and should have incorporated more iconic scenes from the show that would have created a more action filled atmosphere. I could have used the scene where the characters buy the dinosaur ribs, causing their car to fall-over to add more context to young builders as to why there is that random build with the car. Also the house interior was a little too bland and the only interesting about the inside was the bowling set that was included.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Would I recommend this set?</strong></h2>

<p>After analyzing all the intricate details incorporated in the set and many memories that arise from the construction, I must say that this model is in the running for my top 5 list at the end of 2019. Every step of the model only added to the authenticity of the model and made the building process that much more effortless. The characters are iconic for all generations, even if Barney is the same height as Fred in this model, though Fred should be taller. Little imperfections do not detest from the prominence that this grandiose model has for many individuals. This set could have easily been apart of an entire line surrounding The Flintstones legacy, especially portrayed in Lego form, which is the heart of nostalgia for many individuals. I highly recommend this model for its variety of building techniques and nostalgic aspects throughout. Cannot wait for the next line of Ideas sets coming out this year!</p>

"Minifig290","2019-05-12T01:06:02.023Z","Yabba Dabba Doo, A Dream Made In Bedrock","<p>Hello there, today I&#39;ll be reviewing the LEGO Flintstones set from 2019 that retails for &pound;54.99/$59.99 with 748 parts giving a respectable price per part of 7p/8c. This set includes four minifigures the Flintstones car and the Flintstones house and mailbox.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>In this set you get four figures Fred and Wilma Flintstone, Barney and Betty Rubble, lets look at them in more detail.</p>

<p><em>- Fred Flintstone:</em></p>

<p>Fred is wearing is iconic orange with black triangles clothing with is also iconic light blue tie, his legs continue his orange and black clothing until midway as they are dual-molded with tan taking th ether half of his legs. Fred&#39;s single sided face shows his happy smile and a stubble around it. He uses Emmets hair in black which i believe is exclusive for now to this set.</p>

<p>- <em>Wilma Flintstone:</em></p>

<p>Wilma is also wearing her iconic white dress, with blocky gaps were her hips should be. Printed around the top of the torso is a necklace made out of rocks. Her legs continue her dress until, like Fred, it goes to her legs with a pair of dual-molded legs. Wilma&#39;s double sided face has her smiling with lipstick and the other shows her a little cross or concerned or confused. Finally her hair is an orange pony tail hair piece with raised hair at the front.</p>

<p>- <em>Barney Rubble</em></p>

<p>Fred&#39;s best friend Barney who has his brown clothing with some string design at the collar of the torso with some small rips next to each of the arms, his legs are similar to Fred&#39;s with the style but not in orange with black but just a bold brown. Barneys single sided face is similar to Fred&#39;s with a thrilled smiling mouth around his stubble. Finally his hair is Emmets hair in an exclusive yellow colour.</p>

<p>-<b> </b><em>Betty Rubble</em></p>

<p>Barney&#39;s wife, Betty is similar to Wilma with a some changes and the obvious colour changes, she has a necklace with a single white rock. Her torso is like Wilma&#39;s but in a aqua blue colour. Betty&#39;s double sided face has her with a happy lipsticked expression and the other one with her eyes closed and her mouth is open is excitement.</p>

<p><strong>Builds</strong></p>

<p>There are 3 builds, the Flintstones car, mailbox and house that are all detailed to perfection. Lets look at them starting with the car.</p>

<p>- <em>Flintstones Car</em></p>

<p>Even in the stone age people to get to places so the most obvious way is, a car?, any way this car is based on and around a few large technic bricks. Around two large 1x14 technic bricks are a few tiles and sloped parts. Between the technic sides are the wheels which use 2 large tan half cylindrical panels with some rounded plates and tiles connected with pins each. Above the front wheel is a dashboard with a 2x2 round brown tile printed with a wood log end. There is enough space to fit four minifigures comfortably but 5 with a bit of hustle. Above the seating area is a ridged white fabric roof with a cut out at the back. This fabric is connected to some technic parts and bars.</p>

<p>-<i> Mailbox</i></p>

<p>This is a small side build for the house but it holds a great printed part, based on a green plate base with a log holding up the stone box which has a exclusive 1x4 sloped brick with &quot;<em>Flintstone</em>&quot; printed on it. It has space to fit 2 1x2 letter printed tiles which you get one of in this set.</p>

<p>-<i> Flintstones House</i></p>

<p>Now the main build the house, with a large base built using multiple green plates. On the base around the house are a few plants and round tiles to represent stones. On the right side is a large palm tree which uses a large elephants trunk brown part to hold up the 3 leafs with a unprinted dark tan head on each, this tree is angled at the bottom of the house. At the entrance of the house are two silver plant pots with some nice purple flowers in also there are two unprinted transparent glass bottles.</p>

<p>The outside of the house is an organized mess of light gray bricks that make the roof slope. The windows have slopes to make a rugged design. The aqua blue door is built using some brown hinged plates and aqua tiles that is connected to a bar piece inside of the house. Each side of the house use some large slopes going out and then back into the building using a SNOT method that is also used on the chimney with tons of small round and 3/4 1x1 tiles. Now the roof uses two large 8x6 sloped plates in light gray surrounded with a mess of tiles and plates in dark gray that gives a stone age feel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The interior of the house is ,though cramped, perfectly sized for the price of this set. In the house is&nbsp; fire place that is hidden behind a uncomfortable looking white sofa that can fit 2 people, the is a blocky TV with a printed 2x4 tile with a news anchor announcing that Dino is missing. Between the sofa and TV is a coffee table that uses the cloud shaped minifigure base plate that was used in the Unikitty blind bags with a bowl of cherries and grapes. Surrounding the windows are some curtains with a 1x3 tiger print on.</p>

<p>Now there are two hinged interior parts that are 8x6 in size, one has a phone set with a white croissant used as a handset. The other hinged part has a large lamp with a white shade over it and a light nougat crate with three bowling skittles and a black technic ball as a bowling ball. Just to note these hinged parts are prone to swinging around when ever you carry it around.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;m extremely thrilled with this set i love everything included and the &pound;55/$60 price makes it even better. The four figures are spectacular and the interior of the house is well planned out. Though i do wish LEGO had included the Dino and children but never mind.</p>

<p>I recommend this set to any fans of the Flintstones or Ideas sets, as it is a great display piece with great minifigures and builds. Also the the booklet gives a nice bit of detail about the franchise.</p>

<p><strong>Pros - </strong>Great minifigures, iconic builds, awesome printed parts and new pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Cons - </strong>I wish Bamm Bamm and Dino was included, the two hinged parts at the back swing around when its being carried around.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2019-09-02T06:24:11.42Z","Yabba Dabba Doo!","<p>I got this set as a birthday present and it is definitely a fun little set. I built it with my 5 year old son who has never seen the Flintstones but he still enjoyed the idea of cavemen. Of course I grew up watching the show, which of course was already in syndication when I was a kid, so for me it was a lot of fun and brought back memories of watching the show.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Minifigures</b></p>

<p>You get Fred, Wilma, Barney, and Betty, all of whom look great. Fred and Barney have the same hair, just in different colors, but it is very cartoonish with a few hairs sticking up in the back. Wilma and Betty have their own unique hair pieces. Beyond the hair everything else is standard and there are no accessories, unless you count the bowling ball which I will get to later. I feel like they went with the bare minimum in terms of minifigures. There is no Pebbles or Bam Bam, who don&rsquo;t play critical roles in the show, but are a very important part of the families. It certainly would have been fun to include some baby minifigures. However more disappointing is the lack of Dino, after all, who doesn&rsquo;t want a dinosaur?</p>

<p><b>Parts&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>The parts aren&rsquo;t anything too special. They are primarily gray, meaning that if you like Star Wars then you aren&rsquo;t really getting too much you don&rsquo;t already have. However, there are still a handful of special parts that make this set a lot of fun. Most importantly is the palm tree, which isn&rsquo;t just great for the tree parts, but also for the minifigure heads that represent coconuts. You have a bottle, some flowers, a croissant (which is the phone), and most exciting grapes and cherries. You also get a handful of printed parts, this set has no stickers. There are 5 2x2 round tiles printed with tree rings which seem incredibly useful for making logs or tree stumps. You also get the Flintstones logo printed on a rounded brick used for the mailbox, while not particularly useful for anything else, it looks fantastic and really does a great job bringing the whole set together.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The</b> <b>Build</b></p>

<p>So you start off with the car. The car is rather brilliant in that its seats are six studs wide meaning you have no problem fitting in the minifigures. It has a technic base, which doesn&rsquo;t seem very stone age to me, but don&rsquo;t worry, you won&rsquo;t see it. The most interesting parts are the wheels which are made out of large half cylinders, and the roof which is covered by a piece of fabric that looks perfect. Nothing here is revolutionary, but having built tons of Lego cars from the 80&rsquo;s to today, I will say that I&rsquo;ve never built anything like this one, so that says a lot about the creativity used to design this part of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After that you move onto the house, which is completely gray and uses mainly irregular stacking. As a result you have to pay careful attention to what you&rsquo;re doing, but it is fairly simple, my five year old built half of it without any trouble. After finishing the stacking you are left with a lopsided rectangular structure that isn&rsquo;t very interesting. At this point you start using basic SNOT techniques to give the house it&rsquo;s unique rock shape. Again, it isn&rsquo;t anything you haven&rsquo;t seen before, and parts of it are repetitive, but it works brilliantly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally you build the roof which seems surprisingly complex for what is a flat slab. When we opened the set it was late at night and I told my son we&rsquo;d have to save the roof for the morning. The following morning when I woke up, he had already finished the roof and was happily playing with the set. The only thing special about it is it uses some basic SNOT to give it its irregular footprint. The only thing disappointing here is that the roof just sits on top of the house, it does not attach in any way. Just a simple clip would have made it so much more stable, yet still removable to allow for play.</p>

<p>Beyond this you also build the furniture, tree, landscaping, and mailbox. All of it is very simple, but it is also very important in completing the look of this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Final Model and Playability&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall the model looks fantastic and is definitely a play piece. While it has no &ldquo;play features&rdquo;, it is of course a modern stone age house which allows you to live inside of it. It&rsquo;s floor plan hinges open to give you easy access to the whole model after removing the roof. At the same time it looks wonderful on display if that is how you intend to use it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The car looks great as well, and certainly is perhaps the most iconic image of the Flintstones. Its&nbsp;wheels have a little too much friction so they don&rsquo;t always spin, and of course they can&rsquo;t turn. It is also a little difficult to seat the minifigures&nbsp;in it as the seats only have one row of studs located in the back. The steering wheel also detached rather easily. However it does come with a rack of ribs, which don&rsquo;t quite weigh enough to tip the car over, but it is rather fun to recreate that scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, my son&rsquo;s favorite part are the bowling ball and 3 pins. They are as simple as can be, but they sure are fun to play with. Of course you do get extras of all the small parts, so if you have a white 1x1 cylinder laying around, break it out and combine it with the extra parts to build a 4th pin, their is plenty of room to store it in the basket. I just wish that they gave you a few extra bricks to build a lane with. How awesome would it be to have a Lego bowling lane with arrows printed on the tiles. I think I might have to piece together a lane for Fred and Barney to bowl on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall the set looks awesome and is tons of fun. It does have quite a few problems which is disappointing. But what it does well, it does great, and that more than makes up for any shortcomings. My 5 year old son had no problem assembling this set on his own, although we did work together. Several builds, such as the tree were so logical that he skipped ahead in the instructions, memorized how to build it, and then assembled it as I worked on the walls. So don&rsquo;t expect anything too technical from this set, and don&rsquo;t expect to learn too much aside from a new way of building a car. However, if you grew up watching the Flintstones, this set will bring you back to your childhood and is definitely a lot of fun! Building it with my son also made it a very enjoyable family experience. Much more enjoyable than building a large Star Wars set that he isn&rsquo;t able to help with as much as he would like to.&nbsp;</p>
