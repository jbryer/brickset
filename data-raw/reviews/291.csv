This set would probably be more suitable for boys. Girls will probably have more fun with the 1407. One of the reasons I like this (and the 1407) was that they contained food. If you are out for food, try getting the 5604 instead. What really is bad is that there isn't any building. Just pour out the pieces and you've built it!</p><p>Overall, this set will be great for small children, or for big kids making a Duplo house!</p></div></div>",TRUE,3,3,1,2,3
