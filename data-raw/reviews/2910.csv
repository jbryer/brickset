As a stand alone set I think that the baseboard is a little too small for the set which is not a problem if you have other baseboards anyway or you could build up rather than out!
Dinky items such as cups and cakes to make little tea parties with which are popular
with my girls. I think Belville should come in little pink plastic boxes to keep all those
bits in.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
