<p>I have been collecting Lego since 2013. And I own nearly 200 sets! And this set surprised me. More then others I have seen or built.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Unfortunately with a set this size, you can&#39;t expect much. It was interesting to see the coaster track for the first time. But not a great build.</p>

<h2>Minifigs&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The figures are okay. Buzz is great but a step down from the CMF series.the alien isn&#39;t great ether.</p>

<h2>Verdict</h2>

<p>This set exceeded my expectations! Originally I wasn&#39;t even gonna buy this set because it wasn&#39;t a complete Roller coaster. But I reconsidered it when I looked at it as a kiddie ride. And it&#39;s only $20! Get it on sale even better!&nbsp; So I think that it is a great set, not as a roller coaster but as a kiddie ride. Also to get Buzz lightyear in a twenty dollar&nbsp; set. Great !</p>

"Minifig290","2019-12-14T12:56:48.173Z","Disappointing on many levels","<p>Hello all, today I&#39;ll be taking a look at the Toy Story 4 10771 Carnival Thrill Coaster set that was released as part of the 4+ range to be released in conjunction of the Toy Story 4 film, this set was released in April 2019 for the price of &pound;15.99/$19.99 with 98 pieces. The Price Per Part of this set is 16p/20c.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>There are two minifigures in this set, Buzz Lightyear and a Alien.</p>

<p>Buzz Lightyear has a well detailed torso and leg piece that gives depth and detail to the figure, he has a armour piece that was the same used for the 2016 CMF figure with his logo in the centre and some buttons printed. Connected to the armour piece are two wings that have some red and white warning stripes and at the end green and red lights. Now for the most disappointing part of this figure his face, unlike the well detailed head piece in the 2016 CMF this figures head print is faded and isn&#39;t vibrant. This figure is released in another set the Buzz and Woody&#39;s Caravel Mania! 10770.</p>

<p>The Alien is a very nice little figure who uses the same head piece from the 2010 wave but with some better printing for the eyes. His torso has a purple collar and the Pizza Planet logo plus a dark blue belt which like the collar print continues to the back of the figure, and finally he has some unprinted blue short legs. Like Buzz he is released in another set the RV Vacation 10769.</p>

<p><strong>Side Build</strong></p>

<p>There is a small little cart build thats built around a 2x4 Orange brick with some small wheel parts, this has a small red balloon build, a 2x2 round tile printed with a Pizza that was first release din the City 60150 Pizza Van, and it also has a lime green popsicle piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Rollercoaster Build</strong></p>

<p>The rollercoaster build includes the station piece that is built on a large Juniors baseplate in light bluish grey, this has a small little barrier built with a helicopter rotar piece with some 1x2 transparent plates. The station building has two columns built with 2 1x2x5 white bricks with one having a exclusive print with clouds and sparkles. The top has a green piece that covers the top of the entrance with a exclusive printed 2x4 tile with a caterpillar print that connected to the side of the top, on the other side is a camera that aims towards the coaster tracks.</p>

<p>The coaster track includes 6 purples track parts, 4 turns and 2 short pieces that are all connected with some 2x2 red tiles and has some grey bricks to keep the build together.]</p>

<p>Finally the coaster has three coaster carts, one of them at the front of the vehicle has a printed piece that shows a caterpillar face, all three coaster carts are on lime green coaster with two coaster wheels underneath to connect to the coaster tracks. The two other carts have a few tiles and a panel piece to make them look sorta compete.</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To conclude this review i have to say i was very disappointed with this set, the Buzz Lightyear figure has poor printing on his face, the build is very lackluster and the coaster could have at least has one or two ups and downs. The three carts are very boring and don&#39;t give much interesting details. The coaster station is very uninteresting as well. The only benefits for this set is the coaster track pieces in a cheaper way than before.</p>

<p>I do not recommend this set for anyone looking for a fun set, but if your looking for some parts there are some decent ones, the best parts are the 6 coaster tracks, the coaster carts and the coaster cart wheels. The price of this set also makes this set even more disappointing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pros -</strong> Cheaper way to get coaster parts, Alien figure is a nice inclusion, i do like the inclusion of Buzz despite his face printing</p>

<p><strong>Cons - </strong>Poor printing on Buzz&#39;s face, boring builds, overpriced</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-04T11:37:24.517Z","Thrilling Coaster for 4+","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #10771 Carnival Thrill Coaster:</b> LEGO Toy Story 4 has a nice offering of sets, unfortunately the biggest selling point for this set is the inclusion of the six Roller Coaster track pieces, none of the Minifigures are unique, it&rsquo;s even redundant when you consider the other Carnival themed set as that one also included Buzz. I feel this set could have been better spent giving us Hamm, however I will still give it a fair enough shake in this review.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Again the packaging is very nicely done, showcasing the set in action and including the two included characters on the side of the packaging. A lot of nice shots on the back too showing off all the included elements and builds and the Minifigures and then featuring another action shot.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is very efficiently designed and quite easy to follow along with. No true issues here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As noted this set features six roller coaster tracks, four longer curved parts and two short straight tracks in purple completing a circuit, a large baseplate, three roller coaster car parts in lime green and two printed 2x2 tall bricks with some clouds and oddly coloured sky prints. A full pizza is included as well. Overall though it&rsquo;s rather limited in the parts department.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Buzz Lightyear: The exact same Minifigure and print as seen in the previous carnival set. Nothing else to say really, no different facial prints, nothing to differentiate the character.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Little Green Man: We&rsquo;ve seen a load of this character, I don&rsquo;t think this features any different parts or prints from the Disney Series 1 CMF figure, though if I remember right that one may had slightly more detailing compared to this set. Overall a very weak selection of Minifigures.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: First build involves the front kiosk entrance to the coaster and a small food cart, this is a pretty swift and easy build, nothing terribly difficult or frustrating. The LGM is present and ready to ride the coaster once you&rsquo;ve built it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: The coaster itself is a pretty simple build, in point of fact it is highly repetitive and doesn&rsquo;t involve much in the way of building. The tracks are a circle and the carts are pretty similar in build and structure. Overall nothing too interesting about this build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Thrill Coaster: This is a pretty solid model I have to say, it doesn&rsquo;t feature any curves or hills, just a simple circle that spins around and around the track. The carts stay attached fairly well and don&rsquo;t fly off, this is honestly a really good model and pretty fun as a toy, and makes a great starter before moving on to larger and more involved coaster builds in other Themes. The only problem is there isn&rsquo;t really much to it, the build is simple and not very involved, nothing too impressive. It might have been more interesting if they designed the model with something to make it stand out more. Though it is printed to look like a caterpillar, so that&rsquo;s pretty cute honestly.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It&rsquo;s pretty safe to skip this set. I am really shocked that so few Minifigures were included in this set, or that they didn&rsquo;t include at least a third character so that the coaster could have three passengers. Hamm, Potato Head, any of the other characters featured in the movie that weren&rsquo;t already in some of the other sets&hellip; I mean they have a Bullseye mold, why not re-release him in this set? It&rsquo;s a fun toy and great to play with, but it is a bit disappointing when you see the character selection here. Recommended for the parts mostly.</p>
