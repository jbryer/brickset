"Courage","2019-03-10T01:39:41.957Z","A Nice Addition For Most People","<p>So far, the Xtras theme have proven to me personally to be a fantastic little endeavor, to the point that it&#39;s surprising it hasn&#39;t really be done to this extent before. Small cheap-ish bags containing some unique and sometimes pretty uncommon parts is almost essential to people looking to add life into their custom (or existing!) city layout, or other buildings.</p>

<p>This new sticker pack just adds more variety, letting you apply stickers to existing Lego bricks from your own collection for added smaller detail.</p>

<p>The pack includes 5 sticker sheets, as well as a handful of smaller mostly flat plates and stands incase you want to apply stickers <em><strong>immediately.</strong></em> There&#39;s also a pretzel thrown in because why not I suppose.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll get the parts out the way, they&#39;re pretty good pieces to have for added signage and decoration but I can&#39;t help but feel they aren&#39;t incredibly useful with most of the included stickers. For instance, a 4x4 tile with studs on one side is included in sand blue, which doesn&#39;t go too well against the colour scheme of most of the decorations and sign colours. It&#39;s a nice part to have nonetheless.</p>

<p>The stickers themselves are where this pack really shines, including a large variety of generic (in a good way!) shops, warnings, posters and brands that really do blend in to many city, town and industrial scenes. Some particularly stand out ones to me are the vague yet useful Octan logo, the various numbers to add to busses/trams etc., the posters, giant Lego logos as well as a few cereal box designs.</p>

<p>The shop titles are extremely generic and vague but that does help integrate with potentially existing builds smoothly. A few stickers also reference older themes/stickers like the museum logo remaining consistent for a few years now. I also enjoy the more niche designs like an ant farm, large tacky &#39;sale&#39; signs, and many many pretzels. Minifigures just love their pretzels. I guess they need something to dip into all their red coffee mugs.</p>

<p>They do include a few stickers for the large round sign included, but only one of each for whatever reason? This means you can indeed have a sign sticking out, but only one side shows what it&#39;s advertising. I think another set of them would be a nice inclusion. I&#39;d also love for their to me more smaller product like the cereal boxes and honey labels. Why not some small designs for soda cans? Or magazines and newspapers?</p>

<p>I guess the inclusion of small &#39;fragile&#39; and &#39;this way up&#39; signs are a nice compromise, but Lego can often get quite creative with their fake brands. Just look at how long Octan has survived.</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s a lot of words for 5 sheets of sticky paper. Either that shows how much I like them or that I don&#39;t know when to shut up. Either way, this is a great inclusion for people building up realistic city styled MOCs as well as liven up existing sets.</p>

<p>Just try and get over your fear of stickers first.</p>

<p>This is the best accessory you could get for&nbsp;a MOC or setup.</p>

<p>These work great in my apocalypse bunker.</p>

<p>The stickers range from shop signs to sticky notes to fish tanks! 5 sheets of stickers for an great&nbsp;price.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you have&nbsp;something small this isn&#39;t going to be very useful.</p>

<p>The stickers with white areas will look odd if placed on a dark background.</p>

<p>There are some great references on the stickers. (&quot;Paradisa Beach&quot; &quot;Mount Clutchmore&quot; &quot;Cross Axle&quot; ) And some great traffic signs, ads, menus, numbers, clocks, etc.</p>

<p>The parts included are just ok, mostly stuff for signs. The pretzel is nice though.</p>

<p>I recommend&nbsp;buying 2 packs in case you mess up with the placement.</p>

"snazzybricks928","2022-05-04T23:25:32.553Z","Almost Good","<p>853921-1 Brick Stickers is the latest acquisition to my collection, and it is a fine acquisition indeed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Brick Stickers comes with 12 elements, along with 5 sticker sheets, for a total of 17 pieces. The elements include a Pretzel, 2 street signs and a street pole, a 1x6x5 window panel, along with a few tiles. The 5 sticker sheets have designs from Pizza ads to Train routes. The stickers are all transparent-backed, though aren&#39;t the quality of stickers in regular sets, as these are less sticky, and you have to be careful applying them, as the corners of the stickers may lose their adhesive.</p>

<p><strong>Details</strong></p>

<p>The stickers have nice details to them, there are 2 identical decals that show post-it notes with some miniscule writing on them. There are fonts (on the stickers with text) ranging from cursive to sans serif. Given the multitude of stickers for &ldquo;City Pizza,&rdquo; &ldquo;City Food Market,&rdquo; &ldquo;Toy,&rdquo; and various street names and popular destinations. I like the colour variety, and the different sizes of stickers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall 3.5</strong></p>

<p><em>I wish the stickers were of the same quality as seen in sets, although that might&#39;ve ramped up the price. Otherwise, this is a fairly decent decoration tool, and I would recommend it.</em></p>
