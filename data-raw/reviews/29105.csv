It is a&nbsp;nice idea, it comes as a kind of birthday card (about the same size as well) with some space to write a name and a small note. (however, the set is not designed to be sent as mail) The card is the same size and form&nbsp;as 5004931-1</p>

<p>It includes a mini-fig with interchangeable head (boy/girl) and little carnival build with a stud shooter. The card folds out to double the original size, is fully printed with a carnival theme and balloons and can be used as a backdrop and target board to shoot at with the stud shooter (there are some pre-cut holes as targets). It ads really nicely to any fairground or carousel&nbsp;set.</p>
