Unfortunately by the time I finally got around to it, I failed to nab the set. It sold out. So I have never opened this or taken a look at it. That being said, I&rsquo;m reviewing everything, so let&rsquo;s discuss this item&rsquo;s pros and cons.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Sweet Mayhem&rsquo;s Spaceship includes one roll of stickers, this item was cheaply sold to allow for further rolls when the first roll was used up during play.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">The packaging is very user friendly and child safe, a small blister carded item easily opened by adults and with no potential choke hazards or other issues.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Numerous fun sticker designs for imaginative play and which are featured heavily in the film.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Makes for an interesting display element for a collection.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">No buildable elements included.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Not compatible with any other sets.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Useless if 70830 has not been previously purchased.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I purchased this on a whim with full intention of exploring it more. That did not happen. However the sticker roll is a very well thought out product as the set in question can run out of stickers. Only 36 are included on each roll and with children playing they will be used up when re-enacting the scenes in the movie. Or just because. So LEGO was smart to offer this item cheaply online for those who wanted spares. Overall though, unless you purchased it when it was released there is really no point to tracking it down now off the secondary market, unless you are a very determined LEGO Movie 2 set collector who desires every item produced and sold direct from LEGO.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Not Recommended at Secondary Market Prices.</p>
