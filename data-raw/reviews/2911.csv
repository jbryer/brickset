is just my children! Don't forget to keep the box and instructions!! Also
be careful when pushing out the green material for the leaves and 
head garlands etc. that you don't throw out bits that are actually part of the
set. If you are moving up from Duplo you will need some patience with these
sets- lots of teeny little bits but some nice details like little cakes etc.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It's a bit empty compared to the castle sets of same price. 

However, I do like the food stuff, the flowers, the 2 big flowers and the colourful lamps that hang between the 2 big flowers are brilliant. Not forgetting the green beg.

The bed is a bit different from what I expected. 

This set should be earning 7/10. I bought this set at 50% off recently. So, ++2 points for the low price that i got.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
