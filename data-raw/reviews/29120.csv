I can&#39;t help but feel pretty&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;from it, I&#39;m not necessarily implying it&#39;s a&nbsp;horrible&nbsp;set, It&#39;s a&nbsp;decent set (considering it&#39;s a set based off a scene that was in the movie for like, what?...7&nbsp;seconds?)&nbsp;,&nbsp;it&#39;s just that the execution and the build could have been&nbsp;better. Let&#39;s start off with...</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p><strong>The Mech:</strong>&nbsp;It was a nice experience putting this together. That&#39;s about all I can say, the build didn&#39;t have any mind blowing building techniques that would make it more unique compared&nbsp;to other mechs.&nbsp;Just wish it was more unique and interesting in its build. &nbsp;The seating area has Emmet fit there nicely with mugs as the controller of the mech , which I think is pretty hilarious. I also like how it has a &quot;shoulder pad&quot;design which is great. The arms have really good&nbsp;and flexible&nbsp;articulation with clips and ball joints making the top half of the model very&nbsp;posable&nbsp;which is a great feature. The&nbsp;legs&nbsp;are fine but it&#39;s not able to move forward so much, as the bottom of the seating area blocks it from moving forward and it doesn&#39;t offer a lot of good&nbsp;articulation. The small couch design below the seating area looks pretty comfy and it&#39;s a pretty cute design, unfortunately you&nbsp;can&#39;t actually sit a figure there which was a bit disappointing, it would have been nice if there could be a second driver. One of my biggest issues though, is that the claw hand can&#39;t grab figures properly, they should have gone with the exo force fingers to get a good grip of Sweet Mayhem. It&#39;s not a big deal though, since you could easily swap it out.</p>

<p><strong>The Couch:</strong> It does its&nbsp;job just perfectly. Pretty much the double decker couch but with another layer , which allows&nbsp;more people to watch TV together and be buddies! It&#39;s a very comfy design that can seat at least six minifigures. The cup holders and the ladder was also done pretty well. Simplicity was all that was needed in this build and it&#39;s&nbsp;certainly a great build. My main problem is that it doesn&#39;t try to use other pieces from the mech, which leaves you with a lot of extra parts when you keep the model in this build , but that&#39;s just a little nitpick, it&#39;s still a great build.</p>

<p><strong>Emmet:</strong>&nbsp;He&#39;s&nbsp;just another Emmet, his face print uses a bit more of an uncommon design that comes in the Dream House and the Emmet&#39;s piece offering Polybag, with a simple smile expression and an angry expression, which we don&#39;t see often with a Happy-go-lucky character like Emmet, so I liked that. Overall, nothing special here but I still like the Emmet minifigure, who doesn&#39;t?</p>

<p><strong>Sweet Mayhem:</strong>&nbsp;I like the inclusion of Sweet Mayhem here as it&#39;s the second cheapest (excluding the Disco Pod) way to get her. Sweet Mayhem is definitely one of , if not the most detailed mini doll I&#39;ve&nbsp;ever&nbsp;seen.&nbsp;It&#39;s a great figure with very detailed printing and molding in the pieces like the helmet, the armor and the wing pieces, just so many new pieces and even a hair piece that looks so shiny and colorful, it&#39;s just so good, she came with two flame pieces in translucent blue with glitter to have&nbsp;her in a flight mode. Overall, a really detailed mini-doll that isn&#39;t exclusive but still nice to get here.<br />
<br />
<strong>Rampage Kitty:</strong> The only exclusive figure in&nbsp;the set is the Angry Kitty , which has a scared/hissing pose. It has some great part usage for the tail and the exclusive&nbsp;hissing&nbsp;face print is also nice. Overall, a nice variant for Unikitty.</p>

<h2>Value for Money</h2>

<p>I&#39;d say that the price should have been 25 dollars instead of 30, but it&#39;s not too bad of a price.&nbsp;For what&#39;s included here, you get a decent amount of a mech and figures to play with here, but I&#39;d say to wait for it to go on sale. If there&#39;s a set you&#39;re going to pay full price for, I wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s this one.</p>

<h2>Overall Opinion</h2>

<p>It&#39;s a pretty ok set with a decent value to it. The mech build is pretty decent and fun despite there&nbsp;being some flaws with it (just check out Chubbybots&#39;s alternative build of this set on YouTube for a WAY cooler and improved mech),&nbsp;and the figure&nbsp;selection&nbsp;isn&#39;t exactly the most interesting of the theme(though it is pretty&nbsp;fitting from the scene of the movie) but the couch build is pretty much&nbsp;perfect. If you aren&#39;t a fan of the Lego movies and decide to try one set, I wouldn&#39;t go for this one as&nbsp;it&#39;s far from&nbsp;the best set that this line offers, but&nbsp;I&#39;d still say this set is still somewhat good enough for my&nbsp;recommendation.</p>
