The transformation feature is superb &mdash; one moment the school looks normal and in a few seconds it is a monster with huge claws.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p>One thing that amazed me is that this set actually uses bricks for walls and roofs. Unlike most Star Wars sets (which are mostly plates&nbsp;covering technic) here we have many 1x1 bricks, 1x2 and 1x3 bricks, even 1x2 and 1x1 double height. And the roof&nbsp;is formed from 1x2 slopes and there are even 1x2 inverter corner&nbsp;slopes and 1x2 top slopes. It really brings me back to fond memories of building old Black Monarchs Castle. The High school even has the same wall corner pieces that were used to form towers in some castles. This is excellent.</p>

<p>There is a lot of stickers and some are harder to apply but in the end it is manageable.</p>

<p>Much of the space inside the walls is either decorational or serves as a shell for mechanism, but there is still much space to play with minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Figures</strong></p>

<p>The box show 8 figures. That includes small dog figure but doesn&#39;t include the skeleton. So it is still 8. We get yet another Jack and Parker, I don&#39;t get why they are both in so many sets (Spencer the dog too). 3 figures have possessed&nbsp;forms &mdash; transgreen heads, green hair and two have transgreen wings.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>There is a lot of objects figures van interact with &mdash; a computer, cafeteria, library, a classroom etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>The set is quite large and quite heavy. For 1400 pieces it feels smaller than the Star Destroyer 75190, but it is cheaper and denser. There is a lot of place for play and the built-in features are excellent. The price seems adequate for what you get, though as always one would like to pay less for Lego.</p>
