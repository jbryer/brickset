<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The set includes six minifigs, Jack, Parker, JB, Chuck and Mr. Santos, both conductors who can become haunted, and Paul.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The build was enjoyable, rather quick for the price, but satisfying. You start building the train station, which unfortunately does not have much interior design. This is disappointing but the station is obviously not the main focus so it is nice to have. The station also has transformation functions which overall work rather well.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; The most disappointing part of the set is the track. You only get enough to hold the train. Fortunately, you get a ramp that lets the train roll on and off. The track is fastened to the station, which is OK because I believe it helps for the app.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Before I got the set, the images made the train look way too short, but I am happy to say it appears a reasonable length when built. The front car looks excellent, and is the&nbsp; other part of the set that transforms, Wings sprout out of the sides, and the front mouth opens. This works great, and I believe the spring-green wing pieces are exclusive. I&#39;m not that great on keeping up to date in bricks, so don&#39;t blame me if I&#39;m wrong.The second car holds J.B&#39;s machine that I think is supposed to detect gloom. The third and final car holds a storage crate, good for storing the extra gloomed heads. The top of the car had a gun to help catch ghosts. This is a nice car but I feel it lacks detail compared to the other two. The second and third car can also switch out because the machine and crate are not fastened to the car.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Over all, the set is a fun build with great transformation functions, and good minifigs. The train, before seeming short is actually a good size. The lack of track is disappointing, but overall it is a nice set that I would recommend.</p>
