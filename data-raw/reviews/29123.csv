"Saffroth","2019-08-05T06:09:52.233Z","Time to BUS-t some ghosts!","<p>Out of all the Hidden Side sets, this was the one I was excited for the most. School buses are a very general vehicle, and there not being any sort of minifigure scale one before was disheartening. Then this was revealed. I bought it from Amazon and built it. I should also mention that I did not use the app features, as I don&#39;t have a phone that is supported by the Hidden Side game.</p>

<p>Building Experience: 4/5</p>

<p>The set goes together easily enough, as most LEGO models do. There were a few interesting bits, but nothing that profoundly changed me as a builder.</p>

<p>Parts: 5/5</p>

<p>Lots and lots of flame yellowish-orange pieces, including the Volkswagen Beetle wheel arches in flame yellowish-orange (they&#39;re not in Brickset&#39;s inventory as of the time of writing) There&#39;s also a bunch of dark azure parts from the ghost-busting weaponry. The minifigures are nice, bit strange that Jack&#39;s hood is white even with his red jacket though. Also, the construction workers are good even in their human forms, but the ghost figure parts are great.</p>

<p>Playability: 4/5</p>

<p>As i said above, I don&#39;t have the Hidden Side game app. Even without it, this set still has great play value. although the ghosts seem a bit unbalanced with only drill gauntlets, a pickaxe, and a haunted portable toilet against a bus with a lot of weird laser weapons and three cellphone-equipped people.</p>

<p>Value for Money: 5/5</p>

<p>The price per piece ratio is good, eight cents per piece and almost 700 parts for 60 bucks. I&#39;d say the volume of stuff you get is pretty sizeable, as the bus is larger than it looks on the Brickset cover image, I didn&#39;t even know it was eight studs wide until I got the set in my hands. The side builds of the portable toilet, road work sign, and cones wouldn&#39;t look out of place in a City layout. (maybe change the monster eyes to lights in that case)</p>

"szczudel1","2019-09-24T22:23:03.17Z","Biggest Lego disappointment","<p>I could never imagine I could be so disappointed with Lego set. Set itself is ok, maybe too much things happen on the exterior of the bus but children will not notice it anyways. The head changing mechanics is poorly designed but this is the medium&#39;s limitation, so I can go with it.</p>

<p>Thing that got me literally furious is the misadvertisment of the set+app functionality. My son got all fired up about this ghost hunting thing. He builds the model peaking at the photos of the app in the manual or on the box getting excited about ghost hunting. He saw the advertistment online, so he knows what to expect. I take my phone (which we play Pokemon Go on all the time- an AR game) and try to install the app. Not supported it says. I take other phone, nothing. I take another phone, bought 2 weeks earlier (so a quite modern one) also nothing. This is just unacceptable for a toy to be advertised as AR profuct with so poor list of supported devices.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To all the parents - even though advertistments, catalogue and even the box of the&nbsp;set does not mark it with proper attention (just some small font info), check whether the app works on one of your devices. I am not a cyber noob. I have like 3 computers at home and half dozen consoles I did not consider it for a second that AR would not work on one of my newer phones. We only play Pokemon on mobile. My kid does not own a phone, nor he is allowed to use it. I&#39;d rather buy him a game for Switch or PS4 that has some valuable gameplay than let him play mobile garbage.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Shame on you Lego. Now I&nbsp;have to explain to my 7yo, why he cannot go ghost hunting tommorow morning :(</p>

<p>So I saw a bunch of reviews before buying this set. Most of them bad reviews.</p>

<p>Still bought it.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t understand the bad criticism.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a great set. Just... come on... the toilet shoots poop ????</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to have a blast playing with my kids catching ghosts ... without the app.</p>

<p>Yes.. without the app.&nbsp; cause... people... you ain&#39;t missing out on much.&nbsp; Its repeat, repeat and then some more repeat. They could have done so much with the app... but no...&nbsp;</p>

<p>I compare this set to the ultimate batmobile or the ninjago dieselnaut. Just a little smaller but with the same kind of playability and allot cheaper.</p>

<p>Love the set, hate the app. Maybe the app will improve.</p>
