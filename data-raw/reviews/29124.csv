<p>In this review I will talk about the LEGO set, not the LEGO app. I haven&#39;t tried it yet, and probably never will. But hey, lets see what I have to say about LEGO&#39;s latest theme...</p>

<h3>BOX</h3>

<p>Yes, there has been lots of debate about the box-art. Well, I like it: it is different, it shows we are not dealing with an average LEGO-set, but that there is more then meets the eye. Well-done.</p>

<h3>MINIFIGS</h3>

<p>There are&nbsp;5 figs and a dog.&nbsp;<br />
The main characters, Jack and Parker, have new headpieces. Jacks&#39;&nbsp;hoody looks great and is very usable. Parkers&#39;&nbsp;looks weird&nbsp;and not LEGO to me. The hair is OK, but her tan cap looks&nbsp;too big, almost comical. The hot-dog guy is OK, funny, makes me laugh, especially his puking face.<br />
The best figs are of course the shrimp employees: the chef and waitress. Not only are their torso-prints sublime, their ghostly faces are amazing. Stunning prints, stunning molds, just stunning.&nbsp;<br />
Last we have Spencer, Oh the cuteness...come here doggy doggy, doggy, who is a good boy,..cuddlecuddlecuddle, erhm,...sorry...lets move on...</p>

<h3><span style=""line-height: 1.1;"">BUILD</span></h3>

<p>The build is composed of a small little blue car with ghost-gun and a nice terrain-build with the shrimp-shack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The car is OK, nothing special. It uses the big car-piece with fixed doors we have seen before in the adventurers sets from years ago. It holds the minifigures perfectly.&nbsp;Unfortunately there is no room to store their mobile phones. The ghost-gun look good, it is a nice build and the purple dishes are a perfect to give the ensemble an extraterrestrial, ghostly appeal. The worst thing about the car is the backside. It looks weird with its rounded central backlight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The shack is absolutely amazing, Not only the outside, but also, and maybe more so, its interior. Wow, what level of detail: a nicely tiled floor,&nbsp;a crate with fishes, meat and an egg, a coffee-machine (?), a stove&nbsp;and oven and a few kitchen&nbsp;cupboards. But wait, there is more: a little spoon, a bottle of ketchup and mustard, and 2 types of pans. It is an accessory wet-dream :) . The shack stands on a little piece of terrain which holds a nicely build shrimp-sign and small dock-are with a few barrels that are used as tables. It does what it is meant to do, nothing more, nothing less. The color-scheme is spot on. No weird or unusual colors. Good job LEGO.&nbsp;The tree on the side is,&nbsp;unfortunately, awful. Those technic pieces used as branches are horrible, I wish LEGO would stop doing this.&nbsp;<br />
There are plenty of studs to place minifigures all around which is good for play-purpose.<br />
<br />
The action-features that allow you to change the build to its possessed side are subtle: you reveal the evil shrimp and&nbsp;the evil eye and hidden beneath the inside and outside flooring is a large tongue/mouth with teeth. I like the subtleness of these changes, they are not too much in-your-face and make sure you don not have to used them, to enjoy the build.</p>

<p>There are a lot of stickers for a relative small build like this. The little car gets a few very small stickers that do not add anything to the overall model. The sticker on the front of the car even gets lost behind the grill-piece.&nbsp;Most of the stickers on the shack are&nbsp;also,&nbsp;in my opinion, unnecessary. The only stickers that are absolutely essential, are the ones on the diner-sign and the seafood-sign. Apart from the stickers we also get a lot of nicely printed pieces like 2&nbsp;tiles with wood-print, a nice printed tile for the oven and the absolutely stunning &quot;evil eye&quot; print. Wow, brilliant!</p>

<h3>OVERALL</h3>

<p>A great build, a great set and&nbsp;combined with the shrimp-boat (which will be coming my way in 2 days) you will have a winning team! For sure!</p>
