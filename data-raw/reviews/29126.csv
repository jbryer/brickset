In one small set you&#39;ll get a vast sort of pieces in not so frequent&nbsp;colors. Now that i finished the build, and if i find it in a good price (like i did with this), i&acute;m&nbsp;strongly considering having another one.Overall this theme seems to offer a great deal of sets.&nbsp;Good one LEGO!</p>

<p>I never liked the look of this set form the &quot;Hidden Side&quot; theme. IMHO it is the worst looking set form this series so far: the cemetery looks bland, the graves look uninteresting, the shack looks weird and the tree simply awful. At least: that was the impression I got when looking at the box-art and the released promo-pictures.</p>

<p>In all Honesty, I have to admit the set looks much better in person: you still have to use your imagination&nbsp;quite a bit, because the cemetery still looks a bit bland, but the graves are actually nicely build-up and the tree looks good and its action feature is kinda fun :)</p>

<p>The shack tends to become the worst part, with a color scheme that is all over the place and little to no room to do anything with it. &nbsp;I know the playability form the &quot;Hidden Side&quot; series comes form the interactive play, but that doesn&#39;t mean that the LEGO set itself has to become useless. I feel that, at least in this case, it somewhat is.</p>

<p>The set comes with 3/4 minifigures (4 if you include the statue) and a little ghost-dog. The protagonists are the same like in every other hidden side set.&nbsp;I still wish LEGO would have chosen to have a group of youngsters to be the hero&#39;s of the series, so we would have different characters in&nbsp;the different sets.The ghostly graveyard keeper is - without doubt - the star of the show. He looks simply stunning in every way and the ghostly key is a nice accessorie&nbsp;to have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, is this a good set? Hmm, it depends:&nbsp;</p>

<p>1.Do you like what yo u see? Well, then you will love what you get.<br />
2.Do you not like what you see, well, then you maybe like the parts, because this set offers a nice variety of parts and pieces, that, for me, are useful in mocs: the gates, the wooden door, the arches, the bricks with snots, the wings, the leaves, the black telescopes, etc...</p>

<p>And maybe, when I think of it, that could be the best thing about this set: it could be something for everybody.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-11-04T16:55:00.213Z","Enter the Dangerous Graveyard and begin to explore the Hidden Side.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #70420 Graveyard Mystery:</b> LEGO Hidden Side is officially over. The Theme lasted for a few years and then finished due to LEGO&rsquo;s decision to end it and probably poor sales over all. I&rsquo;m still hoping to finish collecting the Theme at retail, but it&rsquo;s definitely not going to be easy. That being said, this is one of the first wave sets and an instant must buy on my list. We get so few LEGO Graveyard scenes any that they decide to give us is a welcome addition for display options.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The packaging may or may not have contributed to the poorer sales of Hidden Side after a while, aside from being part of an app game. This packaging is definitely impressive though, love the style of art used to show off the LEGO instead. The shots of the actual set are on the back, but the front shows a lot of action and adventure for the main characters as they do battle against the ghosts of the Hidden Side. Really awesome package design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Our manual is extremely thick card stock and features all of the build steps quite efficiently. App images are shown as well as is customary in Hidden Side LEGO sets. And the cross promotional image in the back showcases all of the sets from Wave One. Overall a decent enough manual design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Including mostly common elements you do find some nice grey versions of the LEGO gold brick element. There are no printed pieces in this set, all of the details are using stickers, so you will probably enjoy this set for that reason if you&rsquo;re looking for some nice elements to use in constructing a Graveyard.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Jack: This version of Jack is also found in the Shrimp Shack set, he&rsquo;s wearing his white hoodie with the black pants combination and carries his typical cell phone tile. His expressions include a large happy smile and a determined angry expression. All of the parts are not too new, but definitely impressive when combined.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Mr. Branson: The only unique figure in the entire set is the Grave Keeper. A man in charge of upkeep of the Newbury Graveyard. He has a pair of coveralls covered in dirt below the waist, he&rsquo;s working hard to keep the Graveyard clean, his head has a smiling expression on one side and a nervous look on the other and his hair piece is a grey familiar looking piece. He has no accessories straight out of the box, but can use the tools in his little shed to help tend to the graves.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Once possessed by a spectral being his hair becomes longer and messy instead of straight combed, represented by a spectral green hair piece, his face is glowing green and he&rsquo;s constantly screaming represented by the mouth being constantly open. Overall Mr. Branson looks great and another fun welcome addition to the Newbury Citizenship.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Parker: This version of Parker is included here in a cheaper offering, but the parts are also used for the version in the large Newbury School set of wave one. She includes her cell phone tile, the unique head piece combination for her hat and hair, her pants are plain blue while her top is black with blue sleeves. She has a scared and smiling expression on either side of her face, and she has her necklace print on her torso. A very solid offering for the character.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Skeleton: This is your standard LEGO skeleton, all of the parts are here, not much to say, except this one is carrying around a ghostly green key. Perhaps a secret means of accessing the Other Side? It&rsquo;s hidden in the graveyard, so it must be there for a reason, I wonder who this poor soul used to be?</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Spencer: Our friendly ghost dog piece is found in this set yet again, you must own half a dozen of these by now. Cute little ghost dogs to populate all of LEGO City? Have you given each one a different name to differentiate them from the one true Spencer? An excellent piece, but I do wish they&rsquo;d make it in some different colours like ghostly green and spooky blue.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Mamali: The ghost boss of this area is depicted as an ancient and spectral grandma with a horrifying expression. She includes a walker too. This particular ghost may not be as impressive as the others, but she&rsquo;s definitely a fun design. Now if only LEGO had made these ghost characters as actual Minifigures instead of digital only characters.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Jack and Spencer deal some major construction damage with help from Skeleton, this portion of the build is a graveyard fence area with some different sized graves and mausoleums. It&rsquo;s a bit of a quick build, faster than I expected while working to construct it, but there&rsquo;s also some sticker placement here which may require some help. This build is definitely simple, plates on top of plates and then bricks to finish off the detailing. Much different from the Harry Potter Graveyard build and somehow a bit more satisfying.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Parker and Mr. Branson team up to finish the build, this is mostly a large storage shed inside of a tree, here Mr. Branson stores all of the tools he needs to tend to the Graveyard, and this is a rather interesting build. Especially the top tree area which is extremely horrifying. As you work on the build you&rsquo;ll see a lot of nice details added in, but we&rsquo;ll get to that shortly, all of the steps for this build are relatively easy to follow along with and nothing really stood out to be as difficult to follow. Overall a very enjoyable build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Graveyard: This model is highly impressive, it is a stretch of ground with turns on it that is loaded with personality. You have fencing, large gates on one side, three different types of grave markers, a small stone that can lift up a large mausoleum that also lifts up and reveals a scary skeleton within and a stone marker with a half angel marker on the top which spins around to reveal the coloured elements which interact with the app.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Then there&rsquo;s the tree which houses a janitorial area with a water tap and a storage area for a broom, a shovel and a pickaxe, the tree on top is monstrous and can flail its arms about which causes the eyes on the front to emote slightly. This represents the transformation of the set, though it does not transform. It&rsquo;s a very solid model with limited features, but loads of imagination for some fun adventures. All of the detailing however is relying on stickers for the tombstones.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a very impressive set. I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t have to tell you that, considering how popular it was when it first came out. Finding it these days may not be easy, considering how quickly Hidden Side seems to have sold out and vanished from most retail areas, even LEGO&rsquo;s own site hasn&rsquo;t put any sets back in stock even from the newer waves once selling out. As if the Theme was already quietly retired during the Pandemic and that is a huge shame because this Theme was pretty ingenious and a very nice breath of fresh air came out amongst many old tired themes. Overall I&rsquo;d recommend this great set, it&rsquo;s a fun set piece and looks perfect. Recommended.</p>
