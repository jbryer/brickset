"OzToymaker","2019-08-01T22:33:43.87Z","AR is not for me","<p>When I first saw the Hidden Side sets that were in the pipeline, I will admit that the page was turned pretty quickly without really looking (as I do with some other ranges- it may be LEGO, but I am not the demographic for the range!)</p>

<p>Lots of colour, geared towards playability, and little focus on the set itself, more on the app.</p>

<p>Despite this, some sets did manage to catch my eye, this being one of them.</p>

<p>The build was very easy, understandably, given it aims at the younger fans, but nevertheless, cute. &nbsp;Along the vein of Scooby Doo and those sets.</p>

<p>Particularly like the boat can be split in two, to shipwreck it on the rocks.</p>

<p>Not such a fan of the colour wheel on the back. &nbsp;Needed for the app, but it is pretty large, and doesn&rsquo;t fit in with the overall look. &nbsp;Some modding, and this set may fit in really well with the Old Fishing Store.</p>

<p>The ghost sailor also comes with a normal head, so as not to loose it, I stored it in the mouth of the crocodile. &nbsp;Seems appropriate!</p>

<p>I did try the app, but it wasn&rsquo;t really for me - might appeal to the younger crowd, but that is fine. &nbsp;I was more interested in the model. &nbsp;The main issue with it however, is the heavy focus on the app on the box art- hard to see the LEGO and what the set is!</p>

<p>Was hoping some of the pieces would be phosphorescent, especially given there are ghosts, but alas- no.</p>

"BelgianBricker","2019-08-06T16:48:31.65Z","Schrimpocalypse","<p><em>&quot;The wrecked shrimp boat&quot;</em> is my second <em>&quot;hidden side&quot;</em> set from LEGO. Together with the <em>&quot;Shrimp shack attack&quot;</em> it will probably be the only 2 <em>&quot;hidden Side&quot;</em> sets I will buy, seeing as how they form a perfect couple.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>BOX</h3>

<p>I said it before and I will say it again: I love this box-art. It clearly shows that we are not dealing with a normal LEGO-set. I feel like the animated style of graphics on the front of&nbsp;the box will particularly be appealing to younger kids. The only thing I would have changed is to show a little bit more of the actual LEGO-set. But apart from that: good job LEGO</p>

<h3>BUILD</h3>

<p>The build is easy and fast. When finished we are left with a little bit of rocky terrain, a nice shrimp-boat, an albino alligator and a kayak</p>

<p>The rocky terrain looks quit good. It uses the same plant/root/vine structure on the left-side as the shrimp shack does on its right-side. Placing the rocky terrain on the left side of the shrimp shack&nbsp;creates an almost perfect continuing landscape in which you can place the boat. I like it. I don&#39;t know if this was intended by the designers or by LEGO, but I really like it.</p>

<p>The rocky,...euhm rocks,&nbsp;hold&nbsp;2 places on either side on which you can place each halve&nbsp;of the boat and a center part&nbsp;that has a little action feature: the entire thing can lift up to reveal an evil face. It s simple, but well executed and the haunted face looks really really good. His evil eyes are printed and look amazing. We even get an extra - sweet. Time to make a&nbsp;zombie-moc&nbsp;figure :)</p>

<p>The boat is a nice build. It looks really good, with a nice gloomy color-scheme. The build uses a few stickers, but most of them, I feel, are unnecessary. The lifebuoy stickers are absolutely&nbsp;needed but that&#39;s about it. We get a nice deck with railing, a control-centre with steering wheel and some control-panels. On the backside we get a great looking engine and some extra space to place a crate of fish.&nbsp;<br />
Although the design of the boat is really good, I have a few small remarks: on the front of the ship we are left with 2 small holes on either side on the deck. This looks a bit weird. The lifebuoys are connected to the wall with blue technic-pins. They are visible from the inside and contrast too much with the white color of the walls. Lastly, the steering wheel stands rather low. That;s about it, no further &quot;complaints&quot; :)</p>

<p>The color-wheel, used for the app, is integrated perfectly in the build of the ship as part of the engine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a bonus, I like the little details all around: the lantern, the crate with shrimps,... it makes the model come alive.</p>

<h3>MINIFIGURES</h3>

<p>Again, these look really, really good. Unfortunately we get another Jack and Parker. I would have liked to see&nbsp;a gang of teenagers to go after the ghosts, so we could have different protagonists in each hidden side set.</p>

<p>The highlights are, again, the ghostly figures: the shrimp-captain looks stunning with his yellow clothes and his transparent octopus-arms on his back.</p>

<p>The only complaint I have is that the yellow printing of the captain&#39;s son&#39;s torso is placed&nbsp;over the blue printing of his sweater, making it look dark and not yellow enough to go with his pants. It is a common problem with LEGO printing these days and should be fixed.</p>

<h3>OVERALL</h3>

<p>Great little set that fits in perfectly with the shrimp shack. I&#39;m happy, oh yes I am :)</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-11-04T16:40:55.04Z","Great fun for Haunted Shipwreck Fans","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #70419 Wrecked Shrimp Boat:</b> Welcome to Newbury a town assaulted by spectral spooks and haunted hordes. LEGO Hidden Side, the latest toy&rsquo;s-to-live based App Game. Buy the sets, build the sets, scan them with the app, enjoy an adventure the likes of which you never expected. I have no intention of playing the game, not because I don&rsquo;t want to, but because I choose not to own a cellular phone. LEGO is already an expensive hobby, paying monthly for a phone I don&rsquo;t want or need just seems pointless to me.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Unfortunately this means my reviews will not touch upon the aspects of the game that the Brickset site reviews have, I will be addressing the toy aspect of this Theme. If you&rsquo;d care to hear more about the game and what it entails, please check out the main reviewer&rsquo;s review here on Brickset.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">LEGO Hidden Side features boxes with a similar design to the LEGO Overwatch sets. The front of the packaging features digital art showcasing the set and the characters engaged in a wild action shot. The back shows the set in physical form, which is why most retailers have, unfortunately, turned the boxes around to try and entice people to buy the sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I say unfortunately because the digital artwork is truly spectacular. And most people shouldn&rsquo;t be confused by a LEGO product in a box on a shelf in the toy aisles, so I&rsquo;m not sure why Retailers think the back is more effective to garner sales.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manuals for this Theme are equally well designed and feature step-by-step instructions which are simple to follow along with. Some of the printed elements in this set are printed, the others rely on the included sticker sheet to add further detailing to the model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set features a smorgasbord of elements which are fun and interesting. There&rsquo;s a load of darker coloured elements, some of which are common, while others are rarer. For example, there are some dark brown elements and a very interesting looking choice of pea soup green plates, a lot of somber black, grey and dark blue elements, which work well for a ghost/haunted inspired theme. It should be noted however none of the detailing seen on the packaging are present, you will need to apply stickers to the boat hull elements and other parts such as tiles and windows.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Captain Jonas: Dressed all in orange rain gear to protect from the sea&rsquo;s sudden weather changes, the Captain of the Shrimp point features a new hat element for a large brimmed rain hat and a torso print with a jacket over a sweater. You need to be warm at sea after all, especially for early morning fishing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Take the extra multi-limbed back bracket piece, the lime green Pirate cutlass and the spectrally enflamed green translucent Minifigure head and you can turn him into possessed Captain Jonas. The ghastly head print is very impressive, with glowing green flames everywhere and a seaweed looking green version of Captain Jonas&rsquo; regular mustache and eyebrows. Truly terrifying.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Jack: Riding around in his little canoe this Minifigure is dressed here in a white hoodie/jacket with black gloves and black pants. His leg has a printed belt with silver bone charm, which is his dog whistle. He has some kind of logo with three red lines on his torso and his cap, and the head piece is dual-molded. The hood is molded in white, while the ball cap underneath is molded in red. To complete the look, this character features a smiling facial expression on one side a screaming expression on the other and carries a black printed smart phone tile with ghostly image on the screen.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Jonas Jr.: Wearing a dark blue beanie and with a terrified expression permanently on his face this Fisherman doesn&rsquo;t have a whole lot of options, unless you want perpetually terrified people to populate your LEGO City for some reason. He&rsquo;s a nice solid looking Minifigure though, aside from the head I don&rsquo;t believe any of the other parts are unique to him.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Parker: She&rsquo;s very unique, highly unique in fact, with her brand new hair element which depicts a yellow tuque with purple braids underneath, a pair of jeans with torn knees (what is with that fashion statement? It has never made sense to me.) and her black top with light blue sleeves with the fanny pack style storage device strapped over her chest and the P necklace dangling from her neck, Parker is truly an impressively detailed Minifigure. She features two facial expressions, smiling and frowning or scowling in thought and has a unique printed smart phone tile complete with ghostly image on the front. All-in-all a truly impressive Minifigure.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Spencer: This Ghost Dog looks pretty good as a piece, while it has a unique sculpt design for the specific character here, with a bit of alternate printing I could see LEGO re-using it in any number of ways as multiple different Ghost Dogs. Either it is dual-molded or LEGO printed the clear abs plastic white to make it look more ghostly. I&rsquo;m more inclined to think it is dual-molded in clear and white because just how it looks slightly layered.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Captain Archibald: This is the &lsquo;boss&rsquo; ghost in the game you will face. He does not come with the set, but a picture of him is shown on the box. A truly menacing looking spectre.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;m not sure if the Alligator Ghost is a pet of his or what, but it&rsquo;s a pretty nice animal to include in this set, the possessed Captain Jonas will have something to use against Spencer the Ghost Dog.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Jack and Spencer join forces with an evil &lsquo;Ghost&rsquo; Alligator and use their canoe to build a swampy looking piece of terrain from somewhere in Newbury, not sure if they have a swamp, but this build is necessary for the transformation feature included with Hidden Side sets. There was some sticker placement, but most of the build is fairly to the point without anything which jumped out at me as difficult or needing of assistance. I think the Alligator is using new parts, the build for this animal is different from what I recall of past creatures LEGO included in such memorable sub-themes as Islanders and the like.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Parker and Captain Jonas step to the forefront working together to put the front portion of the Shrimp Boat together&hellip; The Bow if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, ok I don&rsquo;t know much about ships. There is sticker placement with this build, but what&rsquo;s more interesting is that you get to build the model in two halves. The ship is wrecked after all.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Not the Bow, the Prow&hellip; Silly, forgot about that. Er anyway, this build is relatively straight forward, again. It lets you build the ship up quickly and effectively, you&rsquo;ll also find some special Minifigure elements in this bag. The elements used to turn Captain Jonas into the Possessed Captain Jonas.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: Jonas Jr. helps you as you build the rear section of the ship, the engines and the cargo area. This build also requires some sticker placement, but includes some fun touches for detailing of the ship&rsquo;s engine. Also the shrimp, a very clever use of elements to make these creatures, which also gives them the ability to be held by Minifigures. Simple, fun and a great way to take some spare elements in matching colours to make even more shrimp for your display, litter the wrecked deck of the ship with extra shrimp.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Shrimp Boat: When combined this is a pretty awesome looking little model. Ok, so with the stickers on the windows and some other areas it looks rather odd, considering it hasn&rsquo;t been wrecked yet. But, if you wanted to you could probably buy two of this set or just not attach those stickers and keep the ship model looking pristine. There are no action features here aside from a built up LEGO wheel that spins on the side of the engine, I suspect this is something you are meant to scan when it reveals certain coloured LEGO elements. I have no idea which ones though. Overall though this is a very nice model, I build so few LEGO boats it&rsquo;s really nice to make one which is simply an old-style looking fishing boat.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Swampy Terrain: This model by itself is extremely plain looking, and rather odd out of context due to the Technic Axle joints sticking out from two sections of the rocky terrain. It&rsquo;s an interesting model while built, but once finished you&rsquo;re going to be looking at it and wondering, how can I play with this? Fortunately LEGO thought of this, the central part of the model flips up to reveal a tooth filled spectral face. This bit of terrain is haunted! With the face up the two sides with the barren area on the right and the branch filled are on the left could be considered limbs of a sort, a grasping hand and perhaps the remnants of a hook-for-a-hand that Pirates are famous for.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Wrecked Shrimp Boat: Take apart the Shrimp Boat model and place it onto the two Axles on the Swampy Terrain and you have a Wrecked ship, the front half on one side and the back half on the other. It holds fairly securely, as long as you don&rsquo;t try to pick up the combined model by any of the ship parts. Remember they aren&rsquo;t securely attached. With everything together you can have oodles of fun, especially with the game to play along with while scanning the set. Even without that the set as a whole is surprisingly enjoyable, fun to build, great to display for any Halloween LEGO display or just to have a spooky, haunted location in LEGO City.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Hidden Side as a Theme is very well thought out and designed to interact physically with a game app on your smart device. This means there are some things about the set I did not cover, things which are specific to the game, I do not own a smart device, nor have I touched the game yet. Speaking as a set, this is a very well designed one and highly impressive. It&rsquo;s one of the stand outs from this first wave as a must have.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The models are superb, the Minfigures are truly great with some neat new head pieces that I hope to see in many different colours. In fact, as we now know, Jack&rsquo;s new hoodie baseball cap piece is being used next year for LEGO Ninjago sets for a character there. How long before we see it and Parker&rsquo;s hat/hair combination in LEGO City sets?</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;m pleased to see LEGO still going strong with a &lsquo;Toy&rsquo;s-To-Life&rsquo; type of theme, only this one is more about the app than the console&rsquo;s toy pad. It is a really solid set, the Minifigures are all top notch, and it&rsquo;s a model you don&rsquo;t see too often. LEGO City Harbor and Cargo sets never featured fishing trawlers before. So I would strongly recommend this set, nay I would actually encourage you to get it, the price isn&rsquo;t too steep and everything here is very enjoyable to build and play with. Encouragingly Recommended.</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2020-08-16T19:51:13.11Z","The best hidden side set ","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>The wrecked shrimp boat is the best hidden side set in all categories .</p>

<p>The Minifigures-</p>

<p>The minifigures include Jack , Parker , Captain Johnas and Johnas jr , wich are all great with dual moulded pieces to useful torso and some nice phone prints and tentacle neck art attachment . The animals included are Spencer a very nice ghost dog mould , an alligator in a very nice albino design , three regular Lego fish and two very nicely built shrimp .</p>

<p>The builds-</p>

<p>&nbsp;The only other small thing is the boat for the protagonists to ride in the only detail is a clip and rowing oar on the back . The actual shrimp boat from a distance looks great and closer up it still looks great the very front has two stickers on the hull and the nose has some sand green sloping , the the rounded ledge also has another rustic sticker on each side . The cabin has a multitude of stickers on the exterior and has an exhaust pipe , Windows , a lantern , an antenna and has four identical rails that look great but are not really sturdy . The interior has a steering wheel , a 2&times;2 printed white brick slope and a sticker on the back of a snot brick . The roof has a communication array and a cool shrimp sticker . One major feature of this build is disconnecting each half and now we are moving onto the second half it is significantly shorter than the front of has the engine wich incorperates the necessary colour wheel , a crate for the fish and shrimp and some standing area . The other build is a coastline piece with vegetation and rocks and the central rock can be lifted up to reveal a face and each half of the boat on the rock to make it the wreck boat in the title .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is an incredible set and would be great for absolutely every Lego fan I don&#39;t like the app or other sets but this is amazing .</p>
