"LSWFan","2019-08-01T12:55:08.697Z","A great entry point to the Hidden Side series","<p>Hidden Side is LEGO&#39;s new original concept - a series of sets featuring various places and characters from the town of Newbury, which is haunted and has its very own &#39;hidden side&#39; which can be accessed via building the models and using the Augmented Reality (AR) app on your phone.&nbsp; It&#39;s a little like a more kid-friendly version of the Upside Down, as featured in Netflix&#39;s Stranger Things.</p>

<p>J.B.&#39;s Ghost Lab is the cheapest of the initial wave of sets but despite that it is still an impressive model.&nbsp; You get a nicely detailed&nbsp;lab, featuring bottles, flasks, a camera, a turning &#39;colour machine&#39; (more on that later), consoles and even a 3D printer.&nbsp; The build isn&#39;t too taxing and all of the little details make it interesting and fun to complete.&nbsp; It looks pretty much what you would expect and although it&#39;s a shame the lab isn&#39;t bigger, the app does address that somewhat.</p>

<p>Also included are three minifigures: Jack Davids - a ghost hunter and vlogger, complete with his ghost dog Spencer, J.B. - the scientist who owns the lab, and Elton Douglas - the janitor.&nbsp; Elton has an interchangeable head so that he can appear haunted or just plain terrified.&nbsp; Each of the figures are well realised and highly detailed, Jack&#39;s hood and cap ensemble is particularly impressive.&nbsp; Spencer the ghost dog is a great little figure with his body being half-translucent.</p>

<p>As a toy in its own right, the Ghost Lab has enough about it and sufficient accessories to be fun to play with and should interact well with the other sets in the series.&nbsp; What takes the whole package to another level is the accompanying app.&nbsp; This is available for free for your mobile phone.&nbsp; Currently it only appears to be downloadable through the App Store for Apple IOS devices, although presumably it will also turn up in Google&#39;s Play Store very soon as well.&nbsp; You have a choice of two game modes: Hunter or Ghost.&nbsp; Choosing Hunter causes the app to scan your completed set with the phone&#39;s camera and it then it constructs a bigger lab behind it and some steaming vents in front.&nbsp; These are solid and work well on the screen with the LEGO set.</p>

<p>You then need to use the Colour Machine within the set to&nbsp;a particular colour&nbsp;as prompted, which you then scan by tapping on the screen.&nbsp; This can be a little tricky as the app is dependent on a well-lit room to pick the colours up properly.&nbsp; If it fails to do this a couple of times the app will turn on your phone&#39;s light to help the situation.&nbsp; It would be good if you could do this manually as it makes a bi difference in picking up the colours.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Once the colour has been scanned you then need to search for it on screen in the form of &lsquo;Gloom&rsquo; floating around the lab.&nbsp;Collecting enough of this will then reveal a ghost, which you must chase around the screen and capture by firing at it.&nbsp; All the time the lab is in the background and the app does a good job of integrating itself with the LEGO underneath.&nbsp; Once you have captured the ghost the mission is complete and you are rewarded.&nbsp; These rewards (mostly more Gloom) can then be spent on random upgrades to your gear, and even further down the line researching other ghosts and so on.&nbsp; You can replay and receive a slightly different experience but broadly it is similar.</p>

<p>Choosing Ghost mode gives you a different game, this time a 3D environment on screen where you wander about as a ghost spreading Gloom on the particular scene.&nbsp; This appears to be a little bit of a selling tool for other Hidden Side sets, as these feature in the scenes, but it&#39;s a solid enough game in its own right and also rewards you for doing well, so you have the pull of unlocking more stuff in-game.</p>

<p>Throughout the app, J.B. appears on-screen to guide you.&nbsp; As Jack is a vlogger, you also accrue (virtual) followers as you go and as you get more you can work on upgrades in J.B&#39;s in-app lab.&nbsp; Overall, the app works well but I can see it getting old quite quickly.&nbsp; Buying more LEGO sets to play with will help but I think LEGO will also need to ensure they continue to enhance the games and content within the app to maintain interest.</p>

<p>It&#39;s very difficult to knock the Lab set itself.&nbsp; It&#39;s a lovely little scene with some cracking minifigures.&nbsp; For &pound;18, it&#39;s fantastic value.&nbsp; Adding the AR is just the cherry on top.&nbsp; It&#39;s all a solid start for Hidden Side, and hopefully this is a range LEGO can develop into something that will really hold the interest of young builders.</p>

"legom0nk3ys","2020-08-25T06:52:23.62Z","A Unique Kind of Set","<p>This was my first hidden side set. When I first saw the theme, I thought hidden side was some licensed theme based on a cartoon. Turns out, ot was an app integrated original theme. For my first time I wanted to try out something small, so I picked the smallest set of the wave.</p>

<p>This set includes the&nbsp;main male protagonist Jack Davids. Jack has a new piece for his headgear, which is a dual-molded piece of a hoodie covering a hat. He has a grin and angry face for his two expressions.&nbsp;Apparently, Jack had a dog named Spencer who died and became a ghost. Spencer is also dual-molded, featuring a white coat over his transparent body and looks adorable. The antagonist of this set is the janitor Mr Elton, but he is not actually evil. He includes an alternate head and hair piece of a ghost, and when switched over he becomes a terrifying possessed minifigure. He has a grin and scared face for his two human expressions. He still retains his green muddy janitor&#39;s uniform, with his vest&nbsp;sporting the logo of his alter ego-El Fuego. The scientist J.B. Watt is the owner of this lab, so she is obviously in the set. One side of her face is an energetic grin and the other is a muddy face. Both are a little too over the top in my opinion. She wears a lab coat with a Frankenstein shirt inside. She also has a new dual-molded headgear piece, which is a lavender hair piece with goggles.</p>

<p>The build for this set is a small laboratory with a chamber in the middle and some big insulators up top. There is a tube with green juice in it that leads ro a round tub, which has a turntable featuring different colours used for scanning in the app. At the other side, there is a computer with a printed keyboard and some tools. A 3d printer is built using a safe/box piece with presumably a controller inside, and the machine also doubles as a table, holding a pizza and a soul artefact, in the form of an Erlenmeyer flask. The back of the build has a ladder leading up to the top, which holds three tubs of chemicals used for scanning in the app. There is also a large panel piece with a large sticker on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set has a great assortment of minifigures, and an interesting build. The play value is there, but the overall look is a bit lacking. However, the more I look at it, the better it looks. The price is fine and there are lots of play opportunities. It a pretty nice set, but not too good for a starter set.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-11-04T16:36:53.977Z","A relatively poor offering from a Theme that could have done better.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #70418 J.B.&rsquo;s Ghost Lab:</b> Welcome to Newbury, where sinister specters and horrifying haunts are the norm. A sinister army of ghouls and ghosties is rising from the grave to unleash a terrible fate upon the good citizens of Newbury and it&rsquo;s up to you, alongside Parker and Jake, to save the day with your new LEGO Hidden Side App.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Introducing a new Toy&rsquo;s-To-Life type of game using Apps instead of toy tags, the Theme includes more building and more fun. In theory at any rate. This set is a weaker offering mostly due to the nature of the model and how it was designed and implemented. Be that as it may, it is still a fairly good source of characters and parts for your collection.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The lively digital artwork on the &lsquo;front&rsquo; shows a thrilling and chilling moment of an experiment going wrong. A citizen of Newbury has been possessed and it&rsquo;s up to Jake to save the day. The back shows off the set in physical form, while advertising the free app to play the game.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is sharing the interesting and vastly different design, the build steps are fairly straight forward with this booklet making it simple and fun enough to build. Though the end results may be a tad disappointing. Stickers are included in this set for detailing, not a lot of printed elements here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Not a lot of elements to discuss in this set, you&rsquo;ll find the standard parts you&rsquo;d expect in a lab model, beakers, test tubes, cylinders and the like, but you won&rsquo;t see anything rare aside from the Minifigure elements and Spencer of course.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Dr. Drewell: The boss of the lab, his soul item is a jar included in the lab. He looks very impressive and seems to be helping the group in the animated episodes. But it might have been more interesting to see a different soul item, or something that could be built, but I suppose LEGO can&rsquo;t have built items for the scanning gimmick.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Jack: In this set Jack is dressed in a red outfit and carries his Cell Phone. Most of his parts are the same here as the Shrimp Boat set and the details are pretty the same.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">J.B.: With a wild hair style, J.B kind of reminds me of Jillian Holtzman in design. Her hair is unique to her with goggles incorporated into it. Her print is highly imaginative, showing the traditional lab coat design with some great elements, including numerous pens and a name tag of sorts. She also has a pink undershirt with LEGO Frankenstein head printed on it. She carries a purple tile printed with her cell phone and has two facial expressions, a grinning smile on one and a dirty disgusted looking expression on the other.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Mr. Elton: Dressed in green coveralls, Mr. Elton has some very impressive details including a pair of small wrenches in the belt on his legs and his cleaning cloth in the pocket. He also has a name tag on him and uses the Mechanic Hair piece from the CMF series in brown. His two facial expressions are highly impressive, with a winking smile on one and a terrified grimace on the other. He has an extra possessed head with a wild hair do, this possessed head features a mouth with slime dribbling down. Pretty funky looking, though not much else to say really.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Spencer: Same here as the Shrimp Boat, Spencer is a great piece and I love the ghost dog idea. Can we get a ghost cat in the next wave of sets LEGO? I&rsquo;d kind of like to see more ghost animals, and cats are fairly common in LEGO form.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: This build is assisted by J.B. and Mr. Elton, notes on the build: Kind of weak honestly. It is easy to follow and doesn&rsquo;t feature any tricky moments, although stickers are used for some detailing this build in this set did not need to be split between two numbered bags. It honestly feels like LEGO is relying too often on the numbered bag approach for building.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Parker shows up to join the others while you finish building the model. And the steps here are a bit repetitive due to the nature of the central section of the model. Overall the build in this set is rather lackluster, considering they break it up between two separate bags for some unnecessary reason and the fact that the model will ultimately not include any play features, this set is a dull build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">People keep telling me this is a perfectly acceptable entry level set for the Theme. I&rsquo;m sorry, but no, no it is not. In my opinion a LEGO set needs to do more than just interact with an app. It needs to embody the creative aspects of the build and play style that is LEGO. It needs to inspired imagination. It needs to be better than a generic lab that would fit in with any other theme. Monster Fighters, Scooby-Doo, Marvel or DC Super Heroes.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This model is colorful and has some very interesting design elements, some of them reliant heavily on stickers. That being said, when compared to the rest of the Theme this set is a very weak offering. Aside from the Minifigures included in this set we have precious little going for it. A wheel spins, you can probably scan a lot for the app to interact with. I wouldn&rsquo;t know, I said I didn&rsquo;t play the game, don&rsquo;t own a smart phone. But I digress.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This model has very little going for it, the big thing that looks like it will spin to let you reveal the possessed character can&rsquo;t even do that. LEGO Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles had a lab set too, and in that one you could turn the central section to turn an ordinary person into an evil mutant named Spyder-Bytze. That set wasn&rsquo;t the best, it had some stability issues, but it had more to do as a toy compared to this build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I apologize if I am coming off as rather negative, but I feel that LEGO can and has done better when it comes to lab builds and this set definitely could have used some more thought outside of just being engaged with the app.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set in my opinion is very weak. Comparing it to other sets in the range and even other lab sets in the past, this just feels really wasted as far as potential goes. I&rsquo;m certain some fans will enjoy the set as is, but I just feel that it wasn&rsquo;t the best use of a set in this range for a heroic base. I will say this much though, it&rsquo;s a decent value for the price, since it does include three Minifigures, Spencer and some nice parts. Despite this I would still not recommend it unless you already have all of the other sets and want to have a complete Theme collection. Not Recommended.</p>

"MasterJumpyCake","2020-09-28T17:22:09.807Z","What a great set! 70418 Review!","<p>This set is my fist, and, judging by the retirement of the&nbsp;theme, probably the last hidden side set. I nabbed it on a bargain &pound;13 on amazon and couldn&#39;t resist it! It has so many cool parts, such but I will get to that later on.</p>

<p>The set comes in an appealing box, the packaging design makes it quite hard to see what the actual set is, but it is colourful, and very satisfying to open.</p>

<p>The set consists of two bags, and the instruction manual. Several large pieces come loose, which I have never understood. The build is relatively simple, using several&nbsp;large wall elements like you might see in the Lego 4+ line of sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build time is relatively quick, only took about 15 minutes in total. The stickers are very fiddly to apply to the elements. There are some really neat parts, such as the silver ball elements (<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6082975/voodoo-ball-%C3%B810-2-no-1-no-1000"">6082975</a>)&nbsp;and the purple dishes (<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6245309/parabolic-element-%C3%B816"">6245309</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigures are neat, with some very good printing on their torso&#39;s and legs. The ghost dog is a good inclusion.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is a good set for anyone looking for a cheap but still nice hidden side set. There is a small amount of playability, and it is compatible with the app, which I found hard to navigate and to use.</p>
