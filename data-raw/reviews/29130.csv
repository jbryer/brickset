"jzisko","2020-06-12T12:26:32.387Z","Way More Than What's on the Surface","<p>This set was gifted to my son during the holidays. &nbsp;It is comprised of a small treasure island, a jeep and a trailer. &nbsp;It&nbsp;comes with the 4 minifigs form the Jurassic World lineup and a Baryonyx, a pretty cool and quite tall dinosaur.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building this set was quite fun. &nbsp;There are three different aspects to the&nbsp;build that are all mutually exclusive of each other, so if you want to build one part before the other, you can finish it to completion. &nbsp;The jeep was a little tough for my 5 year old to build by himself, but he handled the island and the trailer pretty well.</p>

<p>I did enjoy putting the jeep together the most. It comes together slowly and is comprised of mostly plates which allows a lot of color, character, and details to emerge. &nbsp;It has a decent amount of&nbsp;detail and some pieces I&nbsp;wouldn&#39;t expect (the rails down the sides or the windshield&nbsp;are actually crowbars...pretty neat use of that piece). The engine compartment has some great detail, more than I expected from a set this big, and small little things here and there really make the jeep not just cool to play with but cool to&nbsp;look at too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The trailer is fairly simple, but well thought out. Dino damage, plant life and mossy growth, and patchwork repairs are&nbsp;pretty cool. &nbsp;Inside as a bed and a computer: furthering the attention to detail in this smallish set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t have too many cons for&nbsp;the set review. &nbsp;The biggest downside I don&#39;t like&nbsp;it latching mechanism for the trailer&nbsp;door (the side that opens to reveal&nbsp;the inside, not the small white person door). It attaches at the bottom and can be difficult to open. &nbsp;I moved mine towards the top and it was easier to operate that way. &nbsp;The treasure island is an ok part of the set. &nbsp;Though Lego did put thought into adding some action, it does sit to the side when compared with the play that the jeep and trailer get. I do enjoy the gems and gold that comes with it to. All the bricks are decals except for the map 2x2 tile. &nbsp;I&#39;m not a fan of the decals as they wear off much faster.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Baryonyx has two mouth positions: open (as pictured) or fully closed. &nbsp;It can go in between but the two end points &#39;click&#39;&nbsp;into place so you will have to delicately move it. &nbsp;I don&#39;t mind the two &quot;hard&quot; settings to choose from. &nbsp;The arms freely pivot, though the legs have a notched or stepped geometry so the legs don&#39;t just freely&nbsp;pivot while trying to stand him up. A very well done aspect. &nbsp;The head also pivots on a notched hinge as well. It also has a 3x2 area to mount minifigs, other Lego, or whatever on its back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The treasure island, though my least favorite part, I still found to be greatly creative and have a good use of parts outside of their traditional uses. Using the windshield usually found in small aircraft as a waterfall is a welcome divergence. &nbsp;The small action used to reveal the treasure chest is a nice touch, but it still fell flat with me&nbsp;when standing independently. Overall though, it doesn&#39;t detract from the set and does add a nice touch to the overall Jurassic World collection if that&#39;s where you&#39;re going. &nbsp;It can also add to other themes too if used correctly. &nbsp;So still plenty of potential.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A super fun set that will expand your dinosaur adventures and good for most ages. &nbsp;The jeep is awesome and fun to build. If you&#39;re looking for a way to break into the Jurassic World collection, this is a low-risk place to start. You get a great set even if you decide that it&#39;s not a collection you want to pursue.</p>

"ForestMenOfEndor","2020-09-07T21:34:53.403Z","Parts + Playability = (Near) Perfection","<p>I just finished building this and&nbsp;<a href=""/sets/10758-1/T-Rex-Breakout"">10758:&nbsp;T. Rex Breakout</a>&nbsp;with our son and daughter, ages 3 and 4 respectively. The 3-year-old handled the Juniors T.Rex set and had a blast. The 4-year-old assembled Baryonyx, the minifigures and some scenery, and then started plotting out a narrative for everyone. I built the vehicle.</p>

<p>My daughter enjoyed assembling, disassembling and reassembling both Baryonyx and the landscaping. Baryonyx may not be completely accurate (until we invent time travel, no one will design an accurate toy dinosaur), but it is attractive, imposing and full of articulation. If folks ever ask why a LEGO dinosaur might be &quot;better&quot; than an ordinary toy dinosaur, the answer might often lie in the articulation.&nbsp;I had a good time with the vehicle, since its construction was a departure from LEGO&#39;s endless stream of off-roaders. It is nice and wide at 8 studs and deploys lots of bars and clips. The various builds were fun to work on in tandem.</p>

<p>We bought this set mainly for the parts, including Baryonyx, of course, but also the dog element. The recolored husky mold looks just like our much-loved and now departed chow chow. To be honest, I would have paid full price for this set just for the dog (yes, we know about Bricklink!). The off-roader also happens to include some very useful parts for a MOC that we are working on (first generation Ford Bronco in US Forest Service livery). Sand green!</p>

<p>This set very easily checks the playability boxes for both our children: dinosaur, minifigures, dog and vehicle. Played with in that order. An additional dinosaur would make it even more perfect, so that two children can both ROAR at the same time, but that&#39;s why we also built up 10758. As a major bonus,&nbsp;we often read about Baryonyx in our various dinosaur books, and the kids were very&nbsp;excited to reenact&nbsp;some fishing scenarios.</p>

<p>This is not a cheap set, but it can presently be found for the usual 20 percent discount on Amazon. At $48, it is more than worth it. Between the dinosaur, the dog and the sand green parts, I would pay LEGO&#39;s price if necessary. In fact, I could imagine 75935 as a set that I would buy for a mark-up after it&#39;s retired (if we didn&#39;t already own it, or if one of the kids destroys Baryonyx).</p>

<p>All in all, I would recommend this to anyone who likes the Jurassic Park/World theme or dinosaurs in general.</p>
