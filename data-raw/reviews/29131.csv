"Harmonious_Building","2019-09-01T16:18:04.173Z","A dinosaur next to a fun fair, what could possibly go wrong? ","<p>We all know why we&#39;re here. Not with regards to being on this planet, I mean, but with regards to this set. You&#39;re here because you, like me, missed out on Triceratops Trapper (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/5885-1/Triceratops-Trapper"">5885</a>) way back in 2012 because you were being financially responsible, and you&#39;ve never found the stomach to drop US$100 to Bricklink just the Triceratops on its own for the same reason. It&#39;s a strange set of circumstances, I know, but Brickset brings people together. That&#39;s just how it is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, the Triceratops is amazing, and looks just as good as in the digital marketing artwork. It&#39;s all hard plastic except for the grey horns and &quot;beak&quot;, which is of the slightly softer and more rubbery material, and the head itself comes in its own nice little cardboard box to keep it safe in transit, which is just great. Very lovely all around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Even so, dropping US$50 on a LEGO Triceratops might still be a little bit hard to swallow, so yes, there are actually some other things that come with this set, if you can believe it. LEGO made the unusual move here of releasing a third wave of <em>Jurassic World </em>products that don&#39;t really seem to tie in to any of the feature films per se, but it was a good excuse to give us back some of the missing dinosaurs and even some new ones, so I&#39;m not complaining (though I&#39;m still waiting for my <a href=""https://i.ytimg.com/vi/PJ00qpg2AR4/maxresdefault.jpg"">LEGO Ankylosaurus</a> as seen in the video game). Anyway, there&#39;s four minifigs here, and they&#39;re all pretty good. Strangely enough, what&#39;s nice about the figs is this set is that they&#39;re all pretty generic, which means they can easily be incorporated elsewhere with little trouble. You&#39;ve got your 200th version of Owen Grady with a plain grey&nbsp;print - very useful. You&#39;ve got some scientist characters whom I barely remember from the films but also have generic prints which I think actually show up in City sets though I could be mistaken. Last and least, you have &quot;tourist&quot;. She looks good though: two expressive faces and a relatively uncommon hairpiece. Nice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the builds...well, let&#39;s just say they leave a lot to be desired. This set is pretty much five or six fairly tiny builds, and the majority of them are not exactly the best things you&#39;ve ever seen. Owen&#39;s buggy is not bad, and if you leave off the sticker or swap out the front curved piece, it can easily pass as an &quot;unlicensed&quot; buggy that we&#39;ve seen many iterations of over the years. The &quot;spinner&quot; ride is actually more elaborate than it looks, and it does have a fun little gear mechanism in which the &quot;eggs&quot; spin around as they themselves spin around the central white pillar, so that&#39;s pretty neat, and it wouldn&#39;t be too difficult to modify the aesthetic if you wanted to make it match up with some of the recent <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31095-1/Fairground-Carousel"">Creator fairground sets</a> that were released at around the same time as this one. It looks fine if you leave off the stickers. And those, I would have to say, are more or less the highlights. The &quot;entrance gate&quot; build is completely underwhelming. The electric fence is presumably the other main setpiece for the Triceratops to bust through, but it&#39;s better in principle than it is in execution and frankly just doesn&#39;t look that good. The fence can also be connected to the spinner ride - but why? It doesn&#39;t feel that natural and in any case it&#39;s not terribly pleasing to look at or play with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is basically a glorified &quot;battle pack&quot;, and that&#39;s for better and for worse. The Triceratops is the star, plain and simple, and it is awesome. The minifigs are above average and soften the sticker price.&nbsp;The builds, not so much. It&#39;s been seven years since the last Triceratops: wait a few more weeks and see if this goes on discount. But not too long, or you might be waiting until 2026 when this guy becomes US$100 on his own, too, like his cousin from 2012 did. Just saying.&nbsp;</p>
