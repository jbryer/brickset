Just like everyone else, I am super excited for the new Avengers: Endgame movie coming out. This polybag is a great way to get an exclusive ironman figure (though none or the parts themselves are exclusive) and a way to get Iron Man&#39;s beloved robot, Dum-E (also, why is Dum-E not considered to be a minifigure, yet basically every brick-build droid in the Star Wars line is on this website? Robo-Rights yall!)</p>

<p>The Iron Man Minifigure is wearing the new quantum realm suits that appears in every other set this line. He is using the flame pieces in trans light blue for the foot repulsors&nbsp;and 1x1 round tiles for the hand repulsors&nbsp;(personally I prefer the old system of 1x1 round bricks and 1x1 round studs being used instead. I think that it looks better and it allows you to move both legs independently from one another). He also includes a clear stand that attaches&nbsp;to his back. This is a nice inclusion that you don&#39;t see in any other Iron Man set. The head and helmet&nbsp;are the same as on the other Mark 50 and Mark 85 Ironman minifigures.</p>

<p>The Dum-E build is similar&nbsp;to other Dum-E builds, but it is unique. This one is really cool since it is spewing out fire. this is odd since we have never seen on of these robots do this. Fire extinguishers, yes. Actual fire, no. I can&#39;t wait to see how this plays into the movie.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a fantastic polybag with a great minifigure and build (that should be counted as a minifigure as well). It doesn&#39;t spoil anything in the movie and it is just a fun little thing to add to your collection in preparation&nbsp;for the movie.</p>

None of the stores had this thing in stock, I ended up finding it on OfferUp for retail. Weird.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: Dum-E&nbsp;featured prominently in the first Iron Man, when Tony was building his suits. This scene on the front actually harkened back to that dynamic, which didn&#39;t really happen in Endgame. The build is clever, using technic parts to simulate the treads on Dum--E and the arm is again made with common but ideal parts. It&#39;s emitting flames instead of a fire extinguisher but whatever. This is going to fit well into a Hall of Armor scene.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figure is honestly nothing special. The Quantum suits are found throughout the Endgame sets and the helmet/face aren&#39;t unique. The transparent arm and dish help make Iron Man appear to fly with the trans blue flames attached by the technic part. However, the flames, while neat, just don&#39;t look right when compared to the previous cylinders.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, this is a missable set. You can use any Quantum Suit and helmet to add this to a Hall of Armor and Dum-E is made from common parts. No worries if you don&#39;t find this one for your collection.&nbsp;</p>

Great Minifigure.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #30452 Iron Man &amp; Dum-E:</b> From Endgame comes this little Polybag which features a very minimalistic build, I think this might be dangerously close to infringing on Hasbro&rsquo;s Action Figure rights for Marvel Likenesses, because there really isn&rsquo;t much to build here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Iron Man in unique Endgame armour print available in this cheap set.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Dum-E model is quick and easy to build.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Not much to build.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Price-per-piece ratio seems a bit high on the one hand, on the other it&rsquo;s a glorified CMF with extra model for building.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I find this Polybag to be a bit of a mixed bag. It&rsquo;s got Iron Man in his Quantum Armor from Endgame, so there is that, but Dum-E uses a very small number of elements and so we are left with a pretty poor price-per-piece ratio compared to other Marvel Super Heroes Polybag sets. Although there is a nice flight stand included in the set, which is rare to see with Iron Man figures. I&rsquo;d recommend getting it if you find it at retail for a decent price, don&rsquo;t break the bank trying to get it if you can avoid that. Mildly recommended.</p>

"Isj_rocks","2020-05-15T18:07:07.697Z","The Beginning of the Endgame ","<p><strong>Introduction: </strong>This polybag kicked off a long wave of sets for Endgame, and I&rsquo;m proud to have found it. Let&rsquo;s begin a review!</p>

<p><b>Minifigures: </b>The one minifigure included in the polybag is Iron Man in his quantum suit. This polybag is a really cheap way to obtain those great quantum figures. The helmet is the same from Mark 50 and Mark 80, but it works nice here. The quantum suits are extremely detailed with delightful torso and leg printing. The minifigure also includes some blue power blasts and rocket boosters. The headpiece used is the same from Mark 50 and 80 too. That&rsquo;s all for the figure!</p>

<p><b>Build: </b>The Dum-E build Is really great with a yellow variant here opposed to the one from the Hall of Armor set. The build can also roll around on the black studs. The top limb holds a translucent orange flame piece which is a nice touch.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion: </b>Overall, there really isn&rsquo;t much to say about this simple polybag, it&rsquo;s got a great figure and a nice build. I&rsquo;d recommend this polybag for the quantum suit alone. That&rsquo;s my review!</p>
