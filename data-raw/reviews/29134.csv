I have yet to pick up&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75258-1/Anakin-s-Podracer-%E2%80%93-20th-Anniversary-Edition"">75258-1 Anakin&#39;s Podracer &ndash; 20th Anniversary&nbsp;</a>set, but this looks pretty good.</p>

<p>Now, all the LEGO Star Wars 20th Anniversary sets are remakes of previous sets. In that sense, this set is not only a miniature model of a remake, but is a remake itself. The first Anakin&#39;s Podracer polybag was&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/30057-1/Anakin-s-Pod-Racer"">30057-1 Anakin&#39;s Pod Racer</a>&nbsp;from 2012 and the first miniaturized build of this vehicle&nbsp;was from&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4485-1/Sebulba-s-Podracer-Anakin-s-Podracer"">4485-1 Sebulba&#39;s Podracer &amp; Anakin&#39;s Podracer</a>&nbsp;from 2003. In my opinion, this is the best of the three miniature representations of this</p>

<p>One thing that I don&#39;t like about the build is that the bars that hols the two pods together should be pink, not purple. This isn&#39;t a huge problem, but it does annoy me. I also don&#39;t like how flimsy the front flaps are. The break off pretty easily and are had to aline properly. Other than that, this looks pretty good for it&#39;s scale. The engines are built well and the pod itself is nicely shaped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is a nice impulse buy and a fun thing for kids to play with. I would recommend this as a thing to pick up for fun.</p>

"vikings","2020-05-24T05:22:42.49Z","Decent","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a polybag and has the normal polybag sized instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get a few decent parts with this polybag. You get two trans purple lightsaber blades, 1x2 clear brick, and a clear rod. The total piece count is 58.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a few minutes to build it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a decent Star Wars polybag. The build looks great and resembles the larger scale nicely. The clear rod connects the cockpit to the engines. The trans purple lightsaber blades do a nice job of showing the energy between the engines.&nbsp;The engines are a little unstable and the 1x4 yellow tiles aren&#39;t very unsecure and are hard to keep from looking&nbsp;crooked. Also, there is no stand under the engines, so they just rest on the ground. Other than that&nbsp;(as my only criticism&nbsp;of the set) the set looks good. I do recommend getting this set to add to your Star Wars or lego collection. It is another decent polybag done by Star Wars. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 3-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"KingAlanI","2019-08-18T22:31:14.173Z","Solid little set","<p>I picked this up at Target to go with #75258 (a regular size contemporary model of Anakin&#39;s podracer), which in turn I got because #7131 was one of my favorite childhood sets.<br />
Like other polybags, the building experience is simple rather than good or bad.<br />
Like many podracer models, it&#39;s somewhat flimsy having to attach the engines and cab while not looking more solid than the movie craft. Yet the finished product was still fairly swooshable.</p>
