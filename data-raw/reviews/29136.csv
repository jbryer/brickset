It is an accurate version of the N1 Naboo Starfighter featured in the Phantom Menace. It is totally worth it even if you don&#39;t like the set and you need some parts for a moc.</p>

"J14T14","2019-04-26T18:52:12.277Z","""Spinning is a Good Trick""","<p>I have not yet been fortunate to pick up a full sized LEGO Star Wars Naboo&nbsp;Starfighter set yet, so when I saw a well scaled, cheap polybag version, I knew that I just had to pick it up.</p>

<p>While it would have been nice to get chrome elements instead of light gray, I know that LEGO would never do that for a retail set like this, so I will let that pass. The build it self is sleek and well scaled to the real thing. The representation of an astromech is nice and a lot better than the 1x1 studs that are often used. The build it sturdy and doesn&#39;t have any specific weak spots. A fun thing that I like to do is grab the pole in the back and spin it around like in the movie. There are no especially rare pieces included</p>

<p>Overall, this is just a fun little set that kids would like and can be used in a microscale space battle fro adults. Even as a teen, I enjoyed playing with this set and I encourage you to pick it up if you happen to find it at your local store.</p>

The model was great fun to build and it&rsquo;s awesome to play with or display. The cons are pretty minor and rather nitpicky honestly, the only thing I&rsquo;d say is a real drawback is the lack of retail presence. I&rsquo;m also starting to wish that LEGO would include small action flight stands as part of these sets so the ships can be displayed mid-flight instead of parked in the hangar. Overall though, as with most Star Wars Polybags I&rsquo;d strongly recommend getting this one if you&rsquo;re a fan of this ship design.</span></span></span></span></p>

"BatTotoro","2019-05-11T13:00:14.337Z","Good shape, nice to play with","<p>This set has a really good looking, only the engines seem a bit smaller compare to the real scale but nothing wrong with it. It would have been amazing to have a custom droid painting on the small white part, but that&#39;s not what Lego use to do for this kind of set.</p>

<p>This set is really good to play with, the tail allows to hold it to and the parts are strongly connected.</p>

<p>It was gifted for may the 4th in France, so it is kind of a very good surprise !</p>

"vikings","2020-04-04T05:53:33.89Z","Great Mini Starfighter ","<p>This is one of my favorite Star Wars polybags yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a polybag with a normal polybag sized instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The yellow pieces are nice to get as they aren&#39;t overly common to get. Other than that there aren&#39;t any cool and unique pieces in this set. The total piece count is 48.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The build is quick and easy. There is nothing hard or difficult with it. It took me a couple of minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great Star Wars polybag. This is definitely&nbsp;one of my favorite ones yet. I own one of the larger scale Naboo N-1 Starfighters (set 7877) and it is a very good replica of it. It is very solid and sturdy. You can hold the tail on the back of the starfighter and spin it, which is nice. Overall I am giving this a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
