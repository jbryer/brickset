<p>Issue 12, 13th February&nbsp;2019 to 19th March,&nbsp;of the Lego City Comic comes with Fireman Phil.&nbsp; Last month gave the teaser image of this set and to me it appeared that we would get two Minifigures and the new axe element.&nbsp; Sadly the image was slightly misleading and you only get one Minifigure, who comes with a white fire extinguisher, an Octan barrel and two flames.</p>

<p>The price has gone down again this month and the comic is priced at &pound;3.99, which seems very reasonable for a Minifigure and comic.</p>

<p><strong>Packet</strong></p>

<p>The packet is the same as introduced for Issue 11, which is the new wider foil bag.&nbsp; This may be a bit large for the contents, but seems to be how all magazine/comic sets are provided now.&nbsp; It certainly seems durable enough to cope with life on a magazine stand.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Fireman&nbsp;Phil also&nbsp;appears&nbsp;in the 4+ set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60212-1/Barbecue-Burn-Out"">Barbecue Burn Out</a> and standard Lego City set&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60216-1/Downtown-Fire-Brigade"">Downtown Fire Brigade</a>.&nbsp; It is great that he is featured here as it&#39;s an affordable way to obtain this version of the 2019 fire fighter without buying an expensive set or one that is aimed at new builders and has few parts.&nbsp; His torso and legs are standard and are in all of the 2019 City Fire sets except <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60213-1/Dock-Side-Fire"">Dock Side Fire</a>.&nbsp; Fireman Phil has a white fire extinguisher to battle the fire.</p>

<p>He also has a red helmet that is new for 2019 according to the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6248066"">Brickset Database</a>&nbsp;and a <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6268851"">bright blue oxygen bottle</a> that also new has a new part number as it only appears in 2019 sets.&nbsp; The breathing mask and visor have featured many times before.</p>

<p><strong>Main Build/Parts</strong></p>

<p>This build will not tax anyone.&nbsp; It is four elements that build the barrel in the standard Octan colours and comes with three transparent orange elements, a curved base and two flames, to represent the fire hazard.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>Certainly worth picking this up this month.&nbsp; The only thing stopping it get a five star overall rating is that there is no play function to put the fire out.&nbsp; The fire extinguisher by itself wouldn&#39;t work from a distance.&nbsp; Maybe the inclusion of a stud launcher would have improved this.&nbsp; I did find that a quick blow knocks the fire over well enough.</p>

<p>The back pages of the comic have a cut-out building and recommend that you use blue bricks to try to knock the fire over.&nbsp; They show three round blue plates but sadly don&#39;t include them.</p>
