<p>I glued the styrene in place from the inside with some liquid plastic modeler&#39;s cement and snipped the protruding styrene off on the top of the helmet.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little fine sandpaper action on the top to even things up and no one is the wiser, for the most part.&nbsp; Of the 10 I did last night, I glued some of the helmets in place.&nbsp; I may do the rest in due course.</p>

This is a&nbsp;reasonably cost-effective way to build a small army of these Stormtroopers.</p>
