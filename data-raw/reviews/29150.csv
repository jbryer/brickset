The scene of a kid in chicken costume and a rabbit roller-skating down a ramp is definitely avant-garde. Yet, the design succeeds in illustrating the joy of spring in an Easter holiday colorama complete with the egg-pod, rabbit, chicken, trophy, and colorful garden. The lenticular image of the kid hatching from the egg on the lid of the pod is an interesting touch although I am not sure if it makes a lot of sense. The parts for the set are delivered in a soft bag inside the pod Kinder-Suprise style. The build is moc style and won&#39;t take long. The chicken costume minifig is very detailed and could fit well in a costume party scene. The rabbit is cute. The ingenious part of the pod is how the minifigure can be position on a stand and the pod closed with all the relief in place inside which provides playability for a child besides the ability to reposition the characters around the ramp scene. The pod with the build inside has an unexpected heft to it, since the entire set is packed in a small volume.</p>

<p>To sum it all up, the pod delivers spring fresh cuteness in spades. It would make a nice gift for minifigure collectors and little girls who would appreciate the characters and colors. Most definitely one of the more unique non-pretentious promotional Easter sets out there.</p>
