<p>The outside colors are all black and white, which is really unique for&nbsp;a Lego set.&nbsp; I can understand why this may deter some fans, as it is arguably not as interesting of a build as a result.&nbsp; However, I like the uniqueness of the set because of that.&nbsp; The inside of the set, which contains the moving parts, use various different colors, so it&#39;s not a completely black and white build.&nbsp; This set is rather different from the original Ideas set and a bit more complex, but I think it&#39;s been improved.&nbsp; Most notably are the moving paddle wheels and smoke stacks.&nbsp; There are a series of tires on the bottom, so when the set is moved back and forth on a surface the paddle wheels and smoke stacks move.&nbsp; This is rather clever and makes further reference to the original cartoon.</p>

<p>While I feel this is a great model, it&#39;s worth noting that it&#39;s quite expensive.&nbsp; In the U.S. this goes for $89, for a 751 piece set.&nbsp; I understand there&#39;s always the &quot;Disney tax&quot; and licensing fees, but that still feels like a hefty price tag.&nbsp; Just looking at the set, it feels like a $50, maybe $60 set.&nbsp; Shelling out $89 can be a hard thing to swallow.&nbsp; Because it&#39;s an Ideas set and not readily available in most stores, it also likely won&#39;t be discounted or put on sale anytime soon.&nbsp; As such, unless you really have an interest in this set I would suggest waiting for some type of discount.</p>

<p>All of that said, I do really like this set.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s a beautiful set that pays great respect to the source material with the design and color scheme.&nbsp; If you&#39;re a big Disney fan like I am, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to buy this unless you really can&#39;t stand the price.&nbsp; For everyone else, waiting for a price drop may be in your best interest.</p>

"mablemyhre","2019-08-08T02:55:55.33Z","Great Set","<p>This is a very fun set. The parts are primarily black and white. &nbsp;Fitting for a very vintage set. &nbsp;This is a somewhat challenging&nbsp;build. &nbsp;There are gears and other mechanics which cause the smoke stacks do go up and down as you roll it along. &nbsp;The paddle wheels also turn. &nbsp;I would highly recommend this set.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-10-10T15:56:51.767Z","Animation Classic Brought to Life Lovingly","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #21317 Steamboat Willie:</b> LEGO Ideas has been a huge hit with many releases. For the 90<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Mickey Mouse, LEGO once again teamed up with Disney and a fan designer who designed and built a project based on the 1928 Mickey Mouse short of the same name. I had intended to purchase this set myself, but a surprise purchase from my brother had me getting this set this summer. I definitely felt it was worth picking up, but it&rsquo;s hard to accurately review the cost of this set since it was a gift. As such, expect a glowing review that will not discuss the price-per-piece ratio too much.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">LEGO Ideas has always had excellent packaging design. The fully enclosed boxes which feature open up flaps are just extremely useful and versatile, you also have thicker cardboard stock being used with the boxes and each one features a unique design reminiscent of the source material for the set in question.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">In this case the box is pretty much old film black and white greyish tones with the LEGO set prominently shown on the front and the back. This set is #24 and costs 120$ CND. The box is rather large and the manual is very thick. It also features a bit of a write up on the fan designer, the LEGO designer and the graphic designer. As well as a write up on the iconic Walt Disney short which started everything for the company in 1928.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set features a lot of elements in white, black and grey. What is interesting however is that the first bag features a lot of standard yellow, blue, red, green and tan elements. Which is mostly hidden once the model is complete, because these are the parts used for the interior skeleton of the model. Rather than cast new colours for the parts in question, LEGO chose to use standard elements for the build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Mickey Mouse: Mickey has no real print, aside from the two little buttons on his silver dual-molded legs the sculpt of the head includes his face of course, but he has no other printed detailing. He&rsquo;s a simple mouse with humble beginnings and this Minifigure represents a time before his popularity exploded. His little cap sits on his head very well and features silver detailing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Minnie Mouse: As with Mickey, Minnie features dual-molded legs. She has no printed detailing on her torso, her legs feature silver printing for her shoes, while the skirt element included is printed with dots and cast in that sharp silver colour. She has her little cap and a guitar, because LEGO hasn&rsquo;t made a fiddle element yet. (Actually I believe in the short she had a violin along with the Turkey in the Straw music sheet, but again, LEGO hasn&rsquo;t made that piece yet.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: This is an Ideas set, which means there are a lot of steps to the build and a lot of different techniques compared to standard system builds. Case in point, typically you do not place plates in a staggered fashion, all of the studs must attach to the female ports underneath LEGO elements for strong connections. This is what is typically seen, here there are a lot of steps where plates overlap over empty spots in the model, meaning that they do not connect to anything.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The skeletal build of the interior of the ship is extremely engaging because of this as it forces you to start thinking of more advanced build techniques.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Before that though you get to construct a small stand piece with a Mickey icon on the front, this is meant to be a display stand for the Minifigures, but it&rsquo;s also a little nod to how some of the Mickey cartoon shorts started, with an image of Mickey&rsquo;s head in a grey background showing which character would be the focus of the short.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Mickey is also in Bag #1, this build was extremely satisfying.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Moving on we begin to make the actual ship itself. In this build you also make the smokestacks lower portion, which is linked to a wheeled play feature that mimics the animation of the short. This portion of the build is slightly repetitive in certain steps, but overall it becomes a solid model as you work to construct the iconic vessel piloted by Mickey in his cinematic debut. If that sounds repetitive I do apologize, but this is extremely impressive overall and I really love getting new Ideas sets, they always expand how I view LEGO builds.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #3: Minnie is here and the rest of the ship is built. The paddlewheels and whistles and smokestacks for this river boat is extremely impressive. I haven&rsquo;t even started it yet at the time of writing this review and I&rsquo;m eager to start. The build here just looks awesome, and it is nice to see all of the printed tiles on this set. This is definitely worth picking up just to experience the build alone. It&rsquo;s exceptionally satisfying, has a lot of nice detailing to capture the animation model and including a bunch of Technic elements hidden inside allows for a solid play feature&hellip; But I&rsquo;m getting a bit ahead of myself, let&rsquo;s move on to the completed model section.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Steamboat Willie: This model is extremely interesting in design and implementation. The only issue I find with the finished model is that, due to the nature of the build and the play gimmick which allows you to simulate the moving smokestacks you cannot fit the Minifigures inside of the steering area, or inside in general.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Everything I remember from the cartoon is here, the moving crane, the parrot, crates and other cargo and the three whistles on the top of the control area. This model isn&rsquo;t perfect though, the large paddle wheels are built very ingeniously, but perhaps not very practically. The ends of the paddles like to pop off very easily when moving the finished model around. I&rsquo;m amazed they couldn&rsquo;t make this work without using so many clips as they can be notorious for holding things in place on finished models depending on the placement and what&rsquo;s involved.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Display Stand: Included alongside the highly detailed Steamboat is a small Mickey Head stand, this stand can be used as a backdrop piece, or if you remove the parts on the back used to hold it up can sit flat on a shelf for Mickey and Minnie to stand on. It&rsquo;s a fairly solid additional build and quite fun, it reminds me of all the cartoon intros with Mickey&rsquo;s head, which is probably what they were going for.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I am a huge fan of Walt Disney as a company, even some of their more questionable ideas in how they handle certain franchises isn&rsquo;t that big of a deal for me. They make quality entertainment ninety-seven percent of the time, and when combined with LEGO, a quality toy manufacturer, you can&rsquo;t go wrong. The model in this set was designed and implement excellently and while some of the build felt a bit troublesome until it was all finished (I actually got confused as to how to make the smokestacks with the attachments while building.) overall it&rsquo;s a very nice piece and a great set to sit alongside the likes of Disney Castle, the new Disney Train and many others.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As I received this as a present I will not comment on the price, but suffice it to say I strongly recommend picking up this set for any and all Classic Disney fans. I actually wouldn&rsquo;t mind if LEGO expanded from this one set to include other iconic Black and White set pieces from Disney&rsquo;s many years of animation. It&rsquo;d be nice to get some Black and White inspired sets for the likes of Horace Horsecollar and Clarabelle Cow, not to mention Goofy and Donald. Strongly Recommended.</p>

"Shawnjohn","2019-12-10T09:33:31.257Z","Beautiful and iconic set","<p>I absolutely love this set.&nbsp; From the moment i saw it being released, i had to have it as it is as iconic as they come.&nbsp; The overall build was alot of fun, the figs look great and capture that nostalgic feel and there is definitely a nice playability factor with the steamboat wheel moving and moving the stacks up and down.&nbsp; Even the box it comes in looks great and allows for a nice &#39;stand&#39; to showcase the set.</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>- the figs are perfect overall for this set as they capture exactly what era mickey and minnie are from and their look</p>

<p>- lots of moving parts allows for good playability&nbsp;</p>

<p>- everything, including the box, looks great and allows for a great looking showcase piece&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>- it can be a bit pricey, but most licensed lego is nowadays</p>

<p>- could be a slight bit larger to allow for more playability on the boat with the figs</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, i have to give this set a 5.&nbsp; I may be biased because i love this short so much and mickey mouse in general, but it really does look great, both in play and showcasing and captures the essence of steamboat mickey to a tee</p>

"Nordbart","2019-09-29T08:23:46.707Z","a boat and two mice","<p>Hi, this is mz first review. Let&#39;s see how it goes.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s start with packaging. It&#39;s a mostly gray, black and white like it&#39;s source material and shows different views from the set. It looks great, let&#39;s open it!</p>

<p>I knew from seeing previous reviews that I will not be greeted by only white, gray and black parts. But wow. I looks like 80% of the parts are random colors green, blue... I&#39;m concerned that in the complete model it will show....</p>

<p>So... now i have a rolling mechanism of sorts which looks like it cam from cloud chookooland. Now it&#39;s time to add black and white panels. My concerns seem to be mislead. So far it appears the colorful rainbow mechanism seems to be doing his work in the background and the &quot;real&quot; model isn&#39;t showing anything of it.<br />
It starts to look like a boat, let&#39;s move on.</p>

<p>Just a few finishing touches... and suddenly a crane. Yeah, it wasn&#39;t really hidden now. I am no big fan of fiddling with tiny strings and making sure the knots don&#39;t leave to much leftover string. I&#39;m not going to cut it. Anyway it appears I have a boat now. Let&#39;s play!</p>

<p>But first actually it&#39;s been a while since I have seen the movie it&#39;s based on. Luckily it is avialible on YouTube by Disney themselves. It hasn&#39;t aged well... But this isn&#39;t a movie review.</p>

<p>The boat seems to be an ok recreation of the source. There have been a few creative freedoms and cut corners of course. It would have needed to be much bigger to be in right size to the mini-mouses. We only have 3 characters Micky, Minnie and the Parrot. Both Mouses have been recreated quite nice apart from the missing Tails. Especially sad since we have the Hammer but no way to recreate the scene it&#39;s used in.</p>

<p>The Parrot is actually a very mean character in the movie but he looks rather innocent here. Sadly the Big Cat Captain is missing and the other two animals the Cow and the Goat. Which are actually involved in a few scenes.</p>

<p>But I can recreate a few of the scenes involving both Mouses and the Parrot. Functionwise the boat rolls on rubber wheels and spins the waterwheels. A bit fast for my liking though. And both exhausts go up and down if they don&#39;t get stuck. I might need to fiddle with it a bit to make it work easier.</p>

<p>Anyway it&#39;s mostly a display model so it looks great. No colors are to see except from the underside and if you peer down the exhausts. I like it.</p>
