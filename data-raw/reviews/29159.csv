<p>Of course it is only a couple of pieces, but you get a nice minifigure and the rotorblades actually rotate while driving.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gardener George came with the 20th March 2019 to 23rd April Lego City Comic.&nbsp; At first glance you will be reminded of the 2013 Polybag <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/30224-1/Ride-On-Lawn-Mower"">30224 - Ride-on Lawn Mower</a> with the cutting element switched from front to rear and now in bright red.</p>

<p>The price was back up to &pound;4.25 for Issue 13 and this is perfectly fair for a Minifigure and good small vehicle.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The set comes taped to the front of the magazine in the larger foil bags that were new for 2019.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>This particular Minifigure, Gardener George, only appears in this set but the parts can be obtained from various others easily enough.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>With 31 pieces, including the Minifigure, you will never have a build that will tax anyone.&nbsp; However, it&#39;s completed within 12 steps and contains a nice mix of System and Technic parts to make a well sized lawn mower with a simple mechanism for allowing the cutting blades to spin as the vehicle is pushed along.&nbsp; It works by allowing them to rest on the surface and the frictionless pins allow the blades to spin easily - even on a smooth desktop.</p>

<p>I think the addition of a 2x2 plate or two to raise the sloped element at the front so it was above the Minifigure legs would have improved the appearance, but this certainly does not reduce the quality of the set.</p>

<p>None of the parts jump out as too rare but younger builders may not have the Technic elements in their collections.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>For this price the set was fantastic and although this review is written well after the comic was available if you see it attached to future comics, like Lego do seem to do with older sets, then certainly do pick it up - especially as you&#39;d be getting two sets anyway!</p>

<p>The back of the comic showed that Issue 14 would come with a policeman wearing a jetpack, which at the time I could only hope was to be&nbsp;an improvement on the incredibly poor Issue 11 set.</p>
