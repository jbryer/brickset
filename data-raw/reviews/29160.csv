This set is currently available for qualifying Avengers purchases of over &pound;75 / $75 /&nbsp;75&euro;</p>

<p><strong>The Packaging&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The packaging is predominantly black which contrasts from the white packaging of the Endgame sets. To the right of the box is an image of the Iron Man Mark 7 and above is The Avengers (2012) logo to show this set is in &nbsp;commemoration of the last 11 years. To the left of The Avengers logo is the Lego logo and below that is the set&rsquo;s number ,&nbsp;name&nbsp;and recommended age to build it.&nbsp;Depending on where you live , it could show you how many pieces are in the&nbsp;set (211). At the bottom is a Marvel Studios logo with &lsquo;THE FIRST TEN YEARS&rsquo; underneath. The back of the box shows another image of the set . This set is also a celebration for Avengers Endgame. Avengers Tower&nbsp;is featured in the Avengers Endgame film&nbsp;so makes this set more meaningful and commemorative for the final film in the Infinity Saga.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>As with usual promotional sets ; this set only includes 1 minifigure. Tony Stark , portrayed by Robert Downey JR, therefore seems the most sensible option to include as he owns and pays for the tower and is the main character in the MCU.&nbsp;This Tony Stark minifigure however is different to previous minifigures&nbsp;of the famous hero. In this set Stark is wearing the <a href=""http://ironman.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_VIII"">Iron Man Mark 8</a>&nbsp;while it is in mid transformation. His right arm and hand are covered by his suit and the chest plate has attached to his torso. This suit configuration is like the <a href=""https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=0Rg5brwfnF0"">scene</a>&nbsp;in Avengers : Age of Ultron where Vision is born , however&nbsp;that suit was the Mark 43 . The suit included in this set is the Mark 8 which isn&rsquo;t seen in this configuration , but the printing on the torso is accurate to the chest plate on the onscreen Mark 8 having 4 diagonal lines coming from the arc reactor. The printing on the back of the torso is ok however could be more accurate by having a gold accent&nbsp;instead of the white one found on the figure. The head is the same head featured on all of the MCU Iron Man minifigures for the past year . One side of the face has a smirk on and the other has a HUD display which is incredible. An accurate black hairpiece is given to Tony as well&nbsp;as an Iron Man helmet featured on various other Iron Man figures.</p>

<p><strong>The Build&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The build starts with a black round display table where the figure can be clipped to. The model of the tower then built upon that base. An array of techniques are used to build the Avengers Tower which are effective as it creates the tower&rsquo;s shape quite accurately. The top has a landing pad which comes out quite a bit and the viewing point comes over some of it leaving a slight gap where a quinjet&nbsp;flies out. This is by far the tiniest rendition of the quinjet&nbsp;however accurately captures the crafts shape. On the side of the top of the tower is a printed 2x2 round tile . The tile has an &lsquo;A&rsquo; printed on which effectively captures the tower&rsquo;s logo in the films. This piece was created for the Avengers Endgame sets so is effectively re-used here. Two 3x6 w. Angle &rsquo;s are used to create the triangular shape of the tower which is effective. To create the curvature of the back of the tower , 3 Wall 1/2 circle, 2x4x2 W/ Cutout are used.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This set is an amazing promotion with great pieces and an exclusive minifigure. It&rsquo;s clearly not a model to be played with ; however is an excellent display model.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s great if you get it for free , however if you are looking to buy it online you could pay&nbsp;an extortionate price.&nbsp;</p>

"Gridlock007","2019-04-30T19:59:50.963Z","Assemble this set!","<p>This set is my third favorite GWP (gift with purchase). Set#40334 Avengers Tower is a fulfilling vignette.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Packaging: The packaging was a nice black and red box with the 10 years of Marvel Studios logo in the corner. The instructions have no ad in the back.</p>

<p>Minifigure: The one Minifigure included is a Tony Stark suiting up into Iron Man. While arm and leg printing would have been nice, it looks good as is. He comes with a round translucent blue piece to put his helmet on. He is a good addition to the Hall of Armor set.</p>

<p>Build: The first thing you build is the base. It has a sticking out double headlight piece to put on a Minifigure. SNOT would have been ideal. The build was fun to build, even though it was a bit too repetitive. The Avengers logo is a little off, and the tower is built backwards, but those are not&nbsp;too hard to modify. The Quinjet included was nice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Comparison to other sets: Lego GWPs are getting better lately. Now, some of the licensed&nbsp;promos&nbsp;are Lego Architecture style vignettes. This&nbsp;looks better to me than the minifig scale Age of Ultron&nbsp;version. It&acute;s successor, the Battle of Hoth, is worse, though the predecessor, the Diagon Alley, is better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is my favorite Marvel promotion they have done. To be eligible for this set,&nbsp;I recommend you buy the Molten Man Battle, Hydro Man Attack, Avengers Compound Battle, or The Iron Man Hall of Armor, or all!</p>
