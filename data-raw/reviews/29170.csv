"J14T14","2019-05-03T15:57:28.893Z","Steamboat Willy- Mickey","<p>Once I saw the inclusion of vintage Mickey and Minnie in this series, I knew that I just had to get them! They are not entirely&nbsp;exclusive though. Versions of these figures are included in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21317-1/Steamboat-Willie"">21317-1 Steamboat Willie</a>&nbsp;ideas set with silver printing that differentiate them from these figures. But since that set is overpriced, this is a great and much cheaper alternative to get these desirable&nbsp;minifigures!</p>

<p>Now as for Mickey, he looks perfect! He reuses the head-mold from the original Disney series, only with white replacing the tan and with solid black eyes. He includes a nice hat piece that connects with a mini-peg&nbsp;attachment. He includes an unprinted black torso with black arms and hands. The legs are duel molded and have wonderful printing. It is in fact the same as the Mickey from the previous series, only in black and white this time around. He includes a light gray boat steering wheel&nbsp;as an accessory. This is great as the only other set this comes in in this color is the Steamboat Willie Ideas set.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a remarkable minifigure and looks great when paired up with the new Minnie! I am so glad to have gotten this figure and I can not think of a single&nbsp;LEGO or Disney fan who would not enjoy this in their collection!</p>

"Slobrojoe","2020-04-06T12:22:00.623Z","A really nice minifig with a cheap (ish) and easy way to get it","<p>Steamboat Willie, donned &#39;Vintage Mickey&#39; by the Collectable Minifigure Series teams, is 1 of 18 Disney Series 2 minifigures.</p>

<p>Packaging:</p>

<p>The minifig comes in the usual plastic blindbag, but the wheel makes this minifig quite easy to find. I don&#39;t really review blindbag art or the instructions, so you&#39;re going to have to find a picture online.</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>Overall, there are 6 pieces: the 4 that make up the minifig, the steering wheel and the black minifig baseplate that we all know and (dare I say it) love. The steering wheel, piece 52395, only appears (in light grey) in 3 sets: this one, 21317 and 76149.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Build:</p>

<p>As usual, the minifig takes less than half a minute to make.</p>

<p>The completed minifig:</p>

<p>The hat is quite tall and the top bit is black whilst the bottom bit is white. You can see a plain white shield-like logo too, but it is a bit obscured by the seal line that runs down the middle&nbsp;of the entire hat. The hat attaches to the head by a small protruding stick that fits into the small hole onto the top of his head. The ears are really nice and rounded and the smile is really fitting. In all, the head is amazing. His torso is plain black and I only have one problem with it. That is that you can see dust on it really easily, so that takes a factor of displayibility down a little. On the legs, it starts off as white with a circle on each leg. It goes down to black and then back to white. The steering wheel fits in his hand very well. My only problem with this is that the pin connected to the wheel is in a bad position compared to Mickey.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pricing:&nbsp;</p>

<p>This minifig was sold for &pound;2.99 or $3.99, although I found the Disney blindbags on sale in various shops. I think this is a decent deal for a minifig&nbsp;otherwise exclusive to the Ideas&nbsp;set 21317, which was sold at the extortionate price of &pound;79.99 or $89.99.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion, I think this is a steal at &pound;3 or $4. Because of the few minor&nbsp;problems, I decided to give it a&nbsp;4 out of 5. It would look amazing next to&nbsp;Vintage Minnie, in the same series. Thanks for reading and if you thought this&nbsp;review was helpful, please hit the &#39;yes&#39; button below.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-30T16:16:52.543Z","Any Port in a Storm.","<p><b>Set #71024 Vintage Mickey:</b>&nbsp;This version of Mickey Mouse is identical in print and design to the version found in the Steamboat Willie set. The basic differences here is the lack of silver highlights on the parts, such as Mickey&#39;s hat which had silver detailing instead of just plain white.</p>

<p>The rest of the figure is completely identical, his parts are all the same, and he even comes with his steering wheel. Uh-oh, looks like Steamboat Willie might have suffered an accident of some sort. Either way, this is one of the weaker offerings if you already bought Steamboat Willie, but a great value if you chose not to purchase it or could not afford it at the time of release. I&#39;d recommend this version of Mickey for folks looking for a cheaper means to acquire this particular version. Recommended.</p>
