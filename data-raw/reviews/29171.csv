They are not entirely&nbsp;exclusive though. Versions of these figures are included in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21317-1/Steamboat-Willie"">21317-1 Steamboat Willie</a>&nbsp;ideas set with silver printing that differentiate them from these figures. But since that set is overpriced, this is a great and much cheaper alternative to get these desirable&nbsp;minifigures!</p>

<p>Now as for Minnie, she looks perfect! She reuses the head-mold from the original Disney series, only with white replacing the tan and with solid black eyes and with eye lashes to differentiate her from Mickey. She includes a nice hat piece that connects with a mini-peg&nbsp;attachment. She includes an unprinted black torso with black arms and hands. The legs are duel molded and have wonderful printing. It is in fact the same as the Minnie&nbsp;from the previous series, only in black and white this time around. Her skirt also has the same white polka dot printing, only it is molded in light gray. She has a white life preserver as an accessory. This is ok, but certainly not the most fitting inclusion. Perhaps a guitar, or a new goat would have been nice to get instead.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a remarkable minifigure and looks great when paired up with the new Mickey! I am so glad to have gotten this figure and I can not think of a single&nbsp;LEGO or Disney fan who would not enjoy this in their collection!</p>

Vintage Style.","<p><b>Set #71024 Vintage Minnie:</b>&nbsp;Again here we have a CMF version of the Minifigure found in the Steamboat Willie set. This version is plain white, no silver markings on her hat or skirt, the printing is identical though with all the same details. She uses dual-moulded legs for her under skirt.</p>

<p>Her accessories include a hat with flower and a toilet seat... I mean... life preserver. Honestly kind of odd for an accessory. I would have thought they&#39;d give her a purse, or maybe a violin since she had one in that short, from what I can recall. Still it&#39;s an excellent means of acquiring a vintage style black &amp; white Minnie Mouse for your display. Recommended.</p>
