But Duck Tales were my favourite animated series back in 1990s, so seeing Scrooge McDuck&nbsp;in Lego was a lot of joy for me.</p>

<p>The minifigure itself looks very much like any other Lego character&nbsp;&ndash; classic body and arms, except for a head, which is exactly like&nbsp;the classic McDuck from 1980s. The black hat is a separate detail, which can be attached to some other minifigures (e.g. Friends).</p>

<p>A small duck tail can be seen in the back, it&#39;s attached via a mini-belt, which makes the body and legs fall apart a little easier than usual. It&#39;s covered in blue paint, just like the legs, which imitate Scrooge&#39;s coat. Red boots are on his yellow legs, a true trait of McDuck (unlike most ducks in cartoons).</p>

<p>Scrooge also has a stick and the most important &ndash; his first 10 cents (1x1 round), which McDuck earned in his youth before gaining his fortune. The set includes 1 extra coin and 1 extra stick.</p>

<p>Scrooge McDuck is a character that I am at least acquainted with and this figure is incredible .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>&nbsp;His mini peg hole attachment is a hat and it looks really good , his head is dual moulded and printed well , his torso is very good and simplistic , his tail is very finely printed , his legs are dual moulded and posses side printing and finally his arms also posses side printing .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>His Accessories include a 1&times;3 reddish brown rod for a walking stick and a 1&times;1 sliver round tile with a one cent print . His stand is the standard CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is my favourite figure from the Disney series two and can be enjoyed by all Lego fans .</p>

With his trusty cane and Number One Dime, this Minifigure looks absolutely stunning. Once more we find ourselves with a newly sculpted head for the Minifigure, this one with sculpted spectacles resting on his beak.</p>

<p>A top hat sits on his head and his printed detailing is top-notch capturing his spats on his webbed feet, the coat and coattails running down his torso to his legs and, naturally, his side-arm print for his cuffs. About the only complaint I could have is the use of a plan brown bar for his cane, it took them years to make a proper Umbrella and yet LEGO has not sculpted a proper curve-handled cane for their Minifigures. He can&#39;t very well practice pogo jumping with a simple stick, he needs a proper handle to grasp to bounce around on the base of his cane and stomp giant spiders, Beagles and so much more. Oh well, at least he looks the part. Highly Recommended.</p>
