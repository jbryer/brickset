With that said, Huey is a pretty good figure , he&#39;s&nbsp;easily the best of the duck triplet in the series.</p>

<p>The main reason he&#39;s better than Dewey and Louie is because his accessory is way more interesting and unique compared to the other two. The Junior Woodchuck guidebook was a great accessory with a great print of the logo on the cover and a 1 by 2 tile print of cardinal points on the inside of the newer style book being able to flip open. The design of the figure itself is pretty simple for Huey , just like his brothers. &nbsp;His head and hat are new molds&nbsp;that look accurate to him, the hat attaches to the head using a peg connection. There&#39;s some great molding on the head for the tufts of hair (or feathers). His torso is appropriately simple for his plain&nbsp;red shirt. And like his Uncle Donald , he comes with a great duck tail piece. His legs use a nice dual molded design for his webbed feet. Keep in mind each figure of the duck triplet is pretty much just a recolor of each other. The head, tail and legs are exactly the same as the other two, differences are different color for shirt and&nbsp;hat, and accessory. I guess this was to be expected since&nbsp;the 3 figures are based off the original show and not the reboot , and they looked pretty much identical&nbsp;in the original show, but maybe they could&#39;ve added some exclusiveness to at least one of the figures to give them different eye printing for different facial expressions or whatnot. But at the end of the day it doesn&#39;t bother me too much, it&#39;s still a pretty good figure.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s one of the better ones of the series, it&nbsp;has enough good qualities&nbsp;and accuracy to the character to justify the price. Again, definitely the best one of the duck triplet for the interesting and unique accessory compared to the particularly bland accessory of a&nbsp;flashlight. It&#39;s a great figure and I definitely recommend it to any Disney or Ducktales fans.</p>

<p>Huey and his brothers are triplets, as such each one shares an identical parts count for the main construction. You have short dual-moulded legs, a little duck tail, a newly sculpted appropriate looking head for the character, a new hat element to attach to said head and a single unprinted solid colour torso with white hands. Each triplet has unique accessories, Huey includes a book part in light green with a printed tile showing a compass inside. The front cover has the Junior Woodchucks logo printed on the front.</p>

<p>Overall a very impressive looking Minifigure. Highly Recommended.</p>
