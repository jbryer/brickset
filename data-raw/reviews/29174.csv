<p>Rather short review, isn&#39;t it? The hats worn by the triplets all use the same small connector element, I have not tried it yet, but it may be possible to attach them to Mini-Doll hair pieces. Which would be interesting. Honestly I can&#39;t think of much else to say, once you discussed the features of one triplet, aside from the colouring, you&#39;ve discussed them all. Dewey is a great addition to the collection and Highly Recommended.</p>
