The only media I watched with the classic rendition of these characters was with &quot;Duck Tales The Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp as well as various Christmas&nbsp;special VHS movies. I have been watching the new Duck Tales series. Because of this, I was really excited to see the four new&nbsp;&nbsp;Duck Tales characters included in this series. All the new characters are based off of their classic looks rather than their new looks, but that is okay. You can easily rearrange different torso prints and adding/ removing hats if you want to create a representation of the new characters.</p>

<p>Louie himself comes with a new head mold and a new hat mold. The head piece is used for Huey&nbsp;and Dewey, but that works. The hat mold fits on with a minipeg and it is the same mold, just different colors, for all the figures. All three of them also share the same leg molds. The torso is unprinted and this is the same for all three boys. This works since the only difference between the three characters in the original show was the colors of their cloths. The only accessory included for Louie is a flashlight.</p>

<p>Overall, I really like this minifigure. It is really fun and goes well with his brothers, his Uncle Scrooge, as well as Donald and Daisy from the last series. I hope that we get more Duck Tales series characters soon because they do a great job every time!</p>

All the parts remain shared between him and his brothers aside from the colour of course, and Louie includes a very nice flashlight accessory. Useful for exploring ancient tombs for untold riches to amass a great fortune and help his Uncle Scrooge remain the Richest Duck in Duckburg.</p>

<p>All three represent their appearance in classic Donald and Ducktales era cartoons, so if you were hoping for modern versions from the reboot. I am sad to say it is not to be. But still I find all three very well put together and make a very great little set. Highly Recommended.</p>
