<p>This fan favourite chipmunk uses a brand-new head sculpted exclusively for him, there&#39;s some fur detailing on his chest and the stripe on his back is included for the sake of accuracy. His legs are medium in dark brown to indicate his height compared to other characters, for an accessory the Mandragora part is re-used, unprinted this time from Series 1 Harry Potter and is topped with the 1x1 with short bar on one side to create an acorn. Very clever use of parts.</p>

<p>Chip may not be sporting a Fedora or a jacket, but he&#39;s still a highly collectible character from Disney and there is still hope one day soon we may see the entire Rescue Rangers team. Until then this is a cheaper alternative to the large train set for the character. Highly Recommended.</p>
