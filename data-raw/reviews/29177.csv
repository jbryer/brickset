<p>I am really into collecting minifigures so I will try not to have much of a biased opinion on this!&nbsp;</p>

<p>This minifigure&nbsp;has some fantastic parts such as the new short legs that move, and that happy, red-nosed face! There is not a lot of detail on the torso but it is made for whith the head. I had fun collecting this iconic minifigure, I just thought it was a little expensive.</p>

<p>I would recommend this set if you like collecting minifigures. If collecting them isn&#39;t really the thing for you, I would suggest looking into buying a different lego set.</p>

<p>Dale is a character that I was unfamiliar with until the release of Disney series two but I appreciate much of the design effort put into him .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>His head is a very interesting dual moulded design with a printed nose and mouth his torso has a print representing a lighter area of the and a tail on the back and his legs are mid-legs in light nougat introduced with the first Harry potter CMF series .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>&nbsp;His accessory is a reddish brown sack which is very nice in that colour . His stand is just a plain old CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>for a character I have no attachment to , I like this figure quite a lot and would recommend him to Disney fans and people in similar situations as me .</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-31T20:34:29.743Z","DALE!","<p><b>Set #71024 Dale:</b>&nbsp;At first glance you might think he uses everything Chip does, and you&#39;d be right, aside from one key fact, Dale has a unique head sculpted for himself. Everything else is pretty much the same aside from colours and that buck-toothed head.</p>

<p>He has a lighter shade of brown for fur, pretty much a tan variation, includes a sack to carry all the nuts/acorns they find and features the same black stripe down his back and a little printed tail. A pity they didn&#39;t give us an actual tail piece, but considering the amount of new parts created for Disney Series 2 itself I&#39;m sure they can be forgiven for that. Overall a quality pair of figures, you can&#39;t have one without the other. Hawaiian Shirt print when, LEGO?</p>

<p>Highly Recommended.</p>
