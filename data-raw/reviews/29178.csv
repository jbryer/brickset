That being said, Jasmine is an excellent looking Minifigure with great attention to detail.</p>

<p>Every aspect of her costume is included, there is minimal printing on her legs for some of the sashes she wore and the lighter colour indications of her shoes, her arm bands are printed on the side of her elbows, and she features great print detailing on her torso, front and back, for her iconic top and necklace. Her hair piece is a re-use from the Disney Princess Theme, as the material is the same used and there is a hole in the top to accommodate the mini-doll accessories. She includes a little white bird, which she was seen handling in the film once. And she has a nice smiling expression.</p>

<p>Overall Jasmine is a highly collectible Minifigure and a great addition to the line. Highly Recommended.</p>
