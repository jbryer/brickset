For some reason, the pictures of the figure didn&rsquo;t really catch my interest at first, I was still going to get him anyway since I wanted to complete the series. Once I did, he totally surprised me, he&rsquo;s not the most detailed figure of the series, but he&rsquo;s simple and pretty darn good.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jafar uses the dress piece in black without printing which is pretty uncommon in that color and it was nice to get it in a cheap CMF. His torso is a very simple design for the printing of his robes on the front and back of the torso, it looks very accurate to the character. His cape was a new cut with a pretty soft feel to it and it has 2 colors with black and red, it&rsquo;s a nice cape and it looks great. He comes with a shoulder armor piece in black, which isn&rsquo;t new or exclusive in any way, but it&rsquo;s my first one of that piece and I liked getting it in a cheap way. I think the aspect of the figure that came out the best/surprised me the most was the face print. I didn&rsquo;t expect a translation of Jafar&rsquo;s face to minifigure form to work so well, he&rsquo;s got a long and cartoony face in the movie (Same with Hades who also appears in this series) but I think the face prints look perfect for the character unlike Hades which came out a little weird in my opinion. The facial expressions themselves also look perfect for Jafar, with an unamused face and a cunning smile. The new mold introduced with the figure is the new headdress piece which came out great! The printing was good and I like the feather molded on there, the piece is pretty smooth as well which I like. Finally, his accessory is a snake staff, which was a fitting accessory and nice to get cheap.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I love this figure. The execution of the figure was perfect and probably one of the best translation of an iconic Disney character into minifigure form in the series. This is one of those figures that look way better in person than the pictures make it look, it totally surprised me and made me realize that it was one of the stronger figures of the series. For a Disney fan like me, this is a must-have, if you aren&rsquo;t one, I still highly recommend him, he&rsquo;s got great parts in addition to a great appearance.&nbsp;</p>

This particular Minifigure uses the newer sloped lower torso piece with no printing. I have discussed this part before with other Minifigures and it just now occurs to me, I forgot to mention that the connection of this new piece is much more solid compared to the older bricks. Whereas previous sloped bricks for legs allowed the torso to come loose quite easily, the new dedicated element connects with similar pin design to an ordinary LEGO leg connection. Meaning that this element clutches better and ensures you won&#39;t lose half the minfigure when storing them.</p>

<p>Jafar has a torso with appropriate front and back printing, the back mostly for his belt sash. He includes a soft-good cape which is two-sided. One colour red, the other black, a shoulder pualdron piece which I do not believe is unique to him, but can&#39;t quite recall where I&#39;ve seen it before. He reuses King Tut&#39;s cobra staff and features a turban head piece unique to him. His face features two expressions, sinister smirking evil face and more somber, cunning, unimpressed thinking face.</p>

<p>Jafar is a great Minifigure, however, much like with Aladdin from Series 1 I am deeply frustrated to find that they did not include his animal companion as an accessory. Iago is missing, and seeing as how Disney LEGO sets are mostly relegated to movie tie-ins I highly doubt we&#39;ll get a dedicated animal piece for Iago, unfortunately. Recommended.</p>
