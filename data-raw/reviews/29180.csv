""That's what I was going to say!""","<p>I have not picked up any of the Disney Princes sets with Anna and Elsa, so to get them in this series as proper minifigures is pretty nice. Anna here looks great and has some nice pieces included with her.</p>

<p>To start, she looks great when compared to the movie. Her hair is a new rubber piece, she has a new two sided face print, a new cape piece, and great printing on her torso and dress piece. The hair could have used a white strip running down the side, but i think that it still looks great regardless. The cape on the other hand is the newer, softer material and it only has one hole at the top to put it over the neck. This means that it will only bend into its proper shape once the hairpiece it put over it. This limits its use on custom minifigures as only similar hair pieces will do the same thing. The torso and dress piece are nicely printed and have great detail. I think that the dress piece and it&#39;s lack of poseability&nbsp;works great here since at one point in the movie, her dress gets wet and becomes frozen and stiff as she tries to walk into the trading post.</p>

<p>The only accessory&nbsp;she comes with is a lantern from the new Harry Potter sets, which works well here.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a really nice minifigure. I can&#39;t wait to pick up her sister soon! This figure is great for all Disney fans and is a welcome inclusion in this series.</p>

<p>Anna has one of the best detailed torso I&#39;ve ever seen. She has a beautiful embroidery flower pattern, which looks nearly the same as in movie. She has a golden trim at the front and the back. To this black shirt blue dress matches perfectly. Here also are two embroidered flowers, which in real life are much more subtle and less visible than on official picture. She als has new type of cape which looks ok.</p>

<p>Face is done in standard skin tone. Anna Has some freckles on her cheeks and great eyelash. Her mouth are very light and subtle. She has two expressions: calm one and winky one. Her hair looks great done in some kind of orange color. She has two braids, which reminds me of Indian hair style.</p>

<p>Anna is equipped with a lantern - quite a new pieces which is really nice and useful.</p>

Her dress is very nicely put together with an excellent torso printed with rich detailing and the new sloped lower torso element also printed with some very nice detail work.</p>

<p>Her hair is a softer rubbery material and a new element, the same for her unprinted soft-goods cloak which fits quite nicely and drapes very well. She carries a lantern with her and has a regular smiling expression on one side and a winking expression on the other. A very solid companion piece for Elsa and lovely new parts. Highly Recommended.</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2020-10-15T07:54:50.277Z","She finally getâ€™s a minifig form, for the first time...","<p>... I&rsquo;m not going to finish it, you&nbsp;know how the rest of it goes. So I bought Anna after seeing Frozen 2 in cinemas back when it came out. Honestly, I think my initial expectations for Anna was the same for Jafar, they were both one of the last figures I had to collect from the series and the pictures didn&rsquo;t convince me too much at first. Both turned out phenomenal figures, Jafar surprised me more, but Anna&lsquo;s still great.</p>

<p>Her dress piece in blue looks great with printing of some beautiful flower designs. Her torso continues the flower design with dark pink flowers on it and some gold lines with a shine to it that were continued to the back printing, it came out really nice and accurate to the movie. A cape in magenta is attached to the figure with one hole, the design of the cape is the soft material that I prefer over the original style and has 2 round collars at the front. The face prints include a smile and a winking expression (something shared with her sister), I really like these face prints and they definitely fit Anna very well. Her hair was a new rubber piece introduced with this figure, it&rsquo;s in a dark orange color and the it has 2 long braids going over the shoulders. I wish the piece was hard plastic instead of rubber, but that&rsquo;s just a nitpick, it&rsquo;s still a really nice and welcome new hair piece. Finally, her accessory is a black lantern with a translucent yellow cylinder piece inside of it to simulate the light coming out of it, I really appreciate the inclusion of this lantern here as it&rsquo;s a cheap way to get the piece and it was a pretty fitting accessory as well.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a perfect figure. It&rsquo;s just awesome to finally have Anna in minifigure form and she translated very well IMO, with great and accurate detailing to her appearance in the movie. Is she one of the best of the series? Well... there&rsquo;s some steep competition, but definitely in the better side of the series. This is a must have for any Disney fans, as for just regular old Lego fans, I&rsquo;d still recommend it since there&rsquo;s some really nice parts to be found here as well.</p>
