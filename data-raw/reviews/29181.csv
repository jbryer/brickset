<p>Minifig looks excellent. Her torso correspond perfectly with skirt part creating beautiful dress. It is done in Light blue with even lighter (nearly white) arms. On them there is a very subtle silver pattern with sone dots and snow flakes. Whole torso has similar painting with lot of silver. I like how they paint the skirt to show how it is ripped at the front. Elsa has also a nicely detailed cape, which is unfortunately done from paper (like old capes) and sticks out.</p>

<p>Her face is done in standard skin color and has a really nice print. I especially like her silver eyeshadow. She has also red lipstick put on her lips. She has two expressions: one rather calm, and second more happy&nbsp; with a wink. Her Hair are light yellow and looks amazing. I like how LEGO made her braid.</p>

<p>She is equipped with a big snowflake, which looks fine, and could be quite useful because of handles on each arm.</p>

<p>Overall it is a great fig.</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2020-08-07T07:14:19.62Z","Let it go has been taken as a review title, I guess I’ll just go with “Into the Unknoooooown!!!”","<p>Wow, I&rsquo;m actually surprised that Elsa and Anna only made their minifigure debuts in the second series and not in the first one given the success of the movies they came from. With that outa the way, I think that Elsa came out great! I have one little problem with her though, and we&rsquo;ll get to that later.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s start off with the dress piece, it looks pretty good in the azure coloring and with printing of shiny silver lines to match the rest of the outfit, it looks pretty great. The torso continues the shiny silver colors with back printing as well and it looks great, she also has arm printing with more of that silver shine, I really appreciate the silver shine all around the figure in general, it looks very awesome. The cape was a new cut that&rsquo;s kinda in between the newer style soft cape and the old papery cape with how it feels when you touch it, the actual design of the cape is a blue one with more of that shine to it, specifically with the snowflakes, and it looks real pretty, the cape was also attached to the figure with one hole only. Her new and exclusive face prints include a smile and a winking expression, something she shares with her sister, I like these face prints, I think they fit Elsa pretty well, one more thing to note on the face prints are that the eye shadow was printed on with some shine to it, I really appreciate that little detail. The new mold introduced with this figure is the hair piece, it was a pretty awesome new piece, I just wish it was plastic instead of rubber though, but that&rsquo;s not my biggest problem with the piece itself, it&rsquo;s the fact that it&rsquo;s yellow. Elsa has white-ish hair in the movies, but Lego still made her hair a light yellow color, a problem shared with the mini-doll version. My gripes with it aside, I still think the hair looks good on the figure and it was a very well-made piece that&rsquo;s very different and superior to the mini-doll one. The inaccurate hair color wasn&rsquo;t a huge issue to me, but it&rsquo;s still an inaccuracy I&rsquo;d like to see Lego fix in the future. Finally, her accessory is a big snowflake piece in translucent blue which was nice to get in a cheap cmf.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I really love this figure. The appearance looks pretty accurate to the iconic character (other than the hair color) and the printing and detailing looks really good all around and it was overall a good translation to minifigure form. She&rsquo;s my third favorite minifigure of the series (behind Jack Skellington and Sally) and I highly recommend her for any Disney fans.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-31T20:47:23.37Z","Icy Snow! Icy Snow! It's almost as big as her!!!!!","<p><b>Set #71024 Elsa:</b>&nbsp;It was inevitable, first Mini-Dolls and then Minifigs! Our lovely looking Minifigure version of Elsa relies on the new lower sloped torso element for her dress, is printed quite elegantly and includes a very impressive top with full gown print to replicate one of her famous dresses.</p>

<p>She includes a brand-new hair piece with her signature style, which is cast in a softer plastic style. She has a soft-goods cape with snowflake prints and some lovely side-arm printing to compliment the design of the dress. Her expressions include smiling face and winking happy face. To simulate her ice powers she includes a massive moulded snowflake made out of crystal blue to represent an ice version. Elsa is breathtakingly beautiful in this form and I Highly Recommend her.</p>

<p>Elsa is character who I don&#39;t care for from a franchise I am indifferent&nbsp;about but this is a very good figure .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The Minifigure has an exclusive hair piece which is nice but in the wrong colour , her cape is very shiny and is positioned in a way that it looks like it is blowing in the wind , her torso and dress are seamless together and her arm printing is great .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>Her accessory is a giant snowflake in a light Trans blue colour . Her stand is just a standard CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a very good minifigure and provides a good value so I recommend it .</p>
