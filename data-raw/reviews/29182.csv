<p>The general detailing of this figure is just outstanding with the stripe printing all over the arms and legs of the character, accurately representing the iconic character from the movie.</p>

<p>His accessories are awesome&nbsp;with his Halloween design of a present with snowflakes (They give you 2 designs of the snowflake piece as well as an extra of each design , which is absolutely welcome). The coattail is also a nice inclusion , along with the new mold for the collar piece,&nbsp;which has some very good attention to detail (like the bat ears,&nbsp;nose and eye molding on the collar). The face print is a big pleasant grin which looks great and I think it fits Jack very well.</p>

<p>Overall, if you&#39;re a fan of The Nightmare Before Christmas or Disney,&nbsp;you&#39;ll definitely love this figure. If you&#39;re not a Disney fan in general,&nbsp;there&#39;s still a lot of cool details to find in this fantastic figure. This figure genuinely feels like a Comic-Con exclusive minifigure made available easily to the public, yes, I love this figure THAT much.&nbsp;He is definitely&nbsp;the best&nbsp;figure of Disney minifigures series 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;I completely recommend this for the price (buy multiples and keep them sealed, he&#39;ll go up in price, I&#39;m sure of that). Pick this one up,&nbsp;I think you&#39;ll find a lot of enjoyment out of it.</p>

<p>This figure is one I have wanted since i got my first minifigure as this film means so much to me and when it was revealed I was over the moon .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure has the iconic face of Jack printed on a white head , his bow tie is the only new mould and represents the in universe one greatly . The torso and coat tails flow very well into each other and the legs have since printing like the arms .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>His accessory is a 2&times;2 present piece with a 2&times;2 white tile print for the lid the contense&nbsp; of the present is two different 1&times;1 printed snow flakes on Trans clear round tiles . His stand is a standard CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this figure means a ton to me as this is a film I watch over and over again every Christmas always have done and I will recommend it to any Lego fan .</p>

Not as wiry or thin as he could be, the Minifigure version of Jack still looks nice when standing next to Sally. Much like Sally there is a lot of attention to detail, with a very expansive print covering a good size surface area. The numerous black and white lines to capture the look of his gothic attire are very well-placed, though it is definitely telling the LEGO has yet to figure out a method of having prints on the inside of the arms and the sides of the torso. This would only serve to enhance such detail heavy characters, such as Jack.</p>

<p>He has a packaged gift with a nice detailed print on the box, this is the same present elements used from Series 18, in a suitably black and white primary scheme with bows to match. (Although the bow really should have been a spider design rather than traditional bow.) Inside are some printed 1x1 round tiles for snowflakes. I guess he&#39;s gifting someone snow for this Halloween... Christmas... Halloween? Oh whatever. He also includes a very nifty new neck piece shaped like his signature tie. This is bat like in design.</p>

<p>Overall Jack is very impressive. Love the attention to detail. Highly Recommended.</p>
