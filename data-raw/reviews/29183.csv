<p>This is , without a doubt , the most detailed minifigure&nbsp;of Disney minifigures series 2 , and also one of the most detailed figures I&#39;ve ever seen. This figure just &nbsp;blows my mind.</p>

<p>This figure is just perfect from top to bottom. The new hair mold&nbsp;is phenomenal! It&#39;s appropriately long for an accurate portrayal of the character , with molding of ridges all around the hair. The faces don&#39;t really capture the character&#39;s appearance&nbsp;in the movie in my opinion, as it would be hard to give the look of the stop motion animation feel from the movie , but with what Lego could work with, it&#39;s still really good and it doesn&#39;t bother me at all. the facial expressions include a smile and an open smile face and they both look nice.&nbsp;What makes this figure SO detailed is the stitching , the cloth and patches all around the legs and torso of the figure, which makes for some really accurate representation of the character. I just can&#39;t do this figure justice with words, it&#39;s just really&nbsp;THAT good to me. The dual-molded legs and arms (with stitches also printed on them) and the shoe printing&nbsp;were a really nice touch.&nbsp;The accessory is a&nbsp;dead flower, using a plant stem&nbsp;piece&nbsp;and the flower accessory piece in black, both exclusive in this coloring here. The accessory choice was pretty clever since it&#39;s from a&nbsp;really iconic scene from the movie&nbsp;, and I especially really appreciate how Lego&nbsp;included an extra of the stem piece and the flower top piece to have an entire second dead flower build.</p>

<p>Definitely one of the best of Disney minifigures&nbsp;series 2 (I like Jack Skellington&nbsp;more by a fair portion). I really just can&#39;t find a flaw in this figure. I love this figure , especially as a fan of Disney and The Nightmare Before Christmas. This is just a perfect figure and would be an outstanding addition to your minifigure collection, even if you&#39;re not a fan of Disney. I completely recommend this, totally worth the money.</p>

<p>Sally is one part of the main protagonists. Her Minifigure looks great, she has a plethora of intricate details for all the seams and joints interconnected via the sewing thread and needle used to put her together. Her torso and legs feature dual-moulding, possibly even triple-moulding judging by how many different colours are used. She has printed designs on her arms, a new hair piece with long wavy back that sits flush against her back and two different smiling facial expressions.</p>

<p>For an accessory she has two plant elements in black, one of the newer plant stem hand held items and a star-shaped flower hair pin from LEGO Friends. Combined they do an effective job of making a piece of Deadly Nightshade. Overall Sally is a very impressive Minifigure and I Highly Recommend her.</p>
