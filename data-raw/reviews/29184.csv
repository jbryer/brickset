I have been wanting this figure to help complete my Incredibles collection (I only need the original <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/30615-1/Edna-Mode"">30615-1 Edna Mode</a> and&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71012-14/Syndrome"">71012-14 Syndrome</a>).</p>

<p>While the original Edna was based off or her appearance in the first Incredibles movie, this one is based off of her look in the Incredibles 2. Her torso is a new print and looks great when compared to the movie. The original Edna also had her classes printed on and reused a common hair piece. This Edna uses a completely&nbsp;new hairpiece that also has the glasses molded in and the eyes printed on. This looks a lot better than the original, but it can be a little off putting at some angles. Her head has new prints with a normal-ish face underneath. I say normal-ish because it has normal minifigure proportions, but it is so different with the glasses on that is is just a little shocking. She also has the short legs in black, which works perfectly considering her height. Her accessories are a tea cup and a bag that has a 1x2 print on it with her business&nbsp;logo on it.</p>

<p>Overall, I think that you should get this minifigure. If you are a Disney fan, pick it up! If you want some new pieces to make some mocs with, pick it up! it is a fantastic minifigure and everyone should try to&nbsp;get one!</p>

<p>Edna Mode reminds me of the world of fashion, to Anna Wintour.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
The figure itself looks perfect and accurate. Her long-sleeved T-shirt is so sophisticated and stylish. The hairpiece is fantastic, it looks great on the figure. I have only one problem with the hairpiece, it looks strange from an upper point of view because the glasses hide her mouth.&nbsp;<br />
It has two accessories, a cup, and an Edna Mode bag. I have to say, I love that bag, it is so chic. It is from the Incredibles 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
All in all, I absolutely love this minifigure, if you are a Disney fan you should get this one!</p>

Is a tad cliche for a title, but what else can I say?","<p><b>Set #71024 Edna Mode:</b>&nbsp;Our favourite diminutive character from Incredibles not part of the Parr family has had some pretty strange releases. First there was a polybag with the game, and then the CMF for Disney Series 2.</p>

<p>I feel the CMF captures the likeness better and shows the character with more interesting details. Her torso has a very solid print for her top and her short legs are a solid black. She carries a tea cup in one hand and a copy of a magazine with her name on the cover used with a 1x2 with bar on the end and a 1x2 printed tile. Her head features a large smiling expression and a dour frowning expression. Her hair piece is quite unique, she is only the third Minifigure I am aware of that incorporates glasses into the hair sculpt to cover the eyes. (The other two being Crazy Scientist from Series 14 and Robin from The LEGO Batman Movie.)</p>

<p>This hair piece also has a hole in the top which is sized to accommodate LEGO Friends accessories. A tad odd that, but I suppose it adds to the versatility. Overall Edna is a very impressive Minifigure and definitely worth tracking down if you want to add her character to the LEGO Incredibles collection. Recommended.</p>
