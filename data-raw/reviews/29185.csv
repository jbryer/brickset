This character is beloved from both movies and was long overdue to make his entrance&nbsp;into LEGO form. I was so happy when I bought my first blind bags for this series and I found this dude.</p>

<p>To start off, he comes with two clear power-blast elements (which I believe are new in that color) and a dark gray dish that was first introduced&nbsp;in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70917-1/The-Ultimate-Batmobile"">70917-1</a>&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70917-1/The-Ultimate-Batmobile"">The Ultimate Batmobile</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sh397/polka-dot-man"">Polka-Dot Man</a>. It is great to get an unprinted version here and I hope that we continue to get more of this piece in more colors. Other than that, a 1x2 white jumper piece is included to help attach him to the minifigure stand included in every blind bag.</p>

<p>The printing on this guy is crisp and clean. Since it is printed on a white surface, it comes out looking great!The arms and legs are duel molded and the printing on the torso and head look perfect when compared to the movie and other Incredibles minifigures.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a fantastic minifigure! It completes the lineup of main characters that we have for these movies and it is a perfect addition to any Disney fan&#39;s collection.</p>

<p>Frozone has some basic but very nice looking detailing from head to toe! He has a circular plate which is supposed to act as some ice he is standing on as well as&nbsp;some very nice ice elements in his hands to indicate his ice powers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only problem I have with this set is the gray stand can&#39;t stand on anything unless you put a 1x2 underneath.</p>

<p>Overall I would recommend this set! It&#39;s a little expensive but it&#39;s worth the money for a nicely detailed minifigure!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-01-08T20:58:15.23Z","Honey... I found my Super Suit!","<p><b>Set #71024 Frozone:</b>&nbsp;This simple looking Minifigure is the last of Disney Series 2. It includes very simple print detailing for some of the costume details on his torso, and his face is single-sided print with a smile and the trademark Frozone visor. Included&nbsp;for accessories are two of the flick-fire hand blast elements and a large circular disc which we saw in The LEGO Batman Movie theme for Polka-Dot Man... or was it The Spot? Oh dear I&#39;ve completely forgotten.</p>

<p>Frozone rounds out the cast of Incredibles quite nicely from the LEGO Juniors sets and is a must own CMF to complement the line. I&#39;d recommend tracking him down if you missed out on the original release window in 2019. Recommended.</p>

<p>Frozone is a very demanded minifigure ever since Disney series one and was strangely omitted from the incredibles two sets .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure has a white head with visor and facial printing , a very simple but accurate torso , dual moulded arms and dual moulded legs .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>His Accessories include two very cool Trans clear power blasts and the disk he slides around ice on which is a recolour of polka dot man&#39;s stand . His stand is the standard CMF stand with a 1&times;2 white jumper to hold Frozone on it .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is the second best figure in Disney series two in my opinion just behind scrooge mcduck I would recommend this to Disney and pixar fans .</p>
