<p>Fig is designed perfectly. His armor is rather simple, but looks amazing. It has some kind of Greek vibes in it. on the upper part of body there are two patches where cape is attached. At the belt he has a great printed emblem of Zeus. At the back is a really subtle painting. Arms are in a darker skin tone, which is great and Hercules has bracelets on both hands. Legs are dual molded and has a nice printing of Greek skirt. On his foot he has sandals&nbsp;which are simple but amazing.</p>

<p>His head is in darker skin color and has two typical expressions: one happy, second angry. I think this could be a very useful face in MOCs. His hair looks weird, but is just like in movie. It is orange and has a red bandana.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hercules is equipped with a standard sword (always good to get one more) and great shield. It is golden with yellow printing on it.</p>

<p>Hercules is one of the best figs in this series of CMF.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-01-06T20:59:52.14Z","Zero to Hero","<p><b>Set #71024 Hercules:</b>&nbsp;Hades&#39; nemesis and the titular hero of the film, Hercules features a brand-new hair element with a wavy design in orange and some great tanned skin tones for his arms, head and lower feet. His print captures the costume of the film very well. You&#39;ll also find a printed shield element with logo of Zeus on the front, this round shield element was first introduced for Captain America if I&#39;m not mistaken.</p>

<p>He has a short sword from The Lord of the Rings theme, a soft-goods blue cloak, rounded not straight, so I believe this is a new element. Two facial expressions, the smiling one and then a sterner look for when he is trying to portray, the hero, and dual-moulded legs with printing as well. Overall a very nice looking and solid Minifigure, I&#39;m curious to see if they&#39;ll find a re-use for his hair element myself. Recommended.</p>
