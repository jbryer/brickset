What are you gonna do?""","<p>I have not had the luxury of seeing the full Hercules movie. I saw the first 30 min or so in my middle school English class five or so years ago. I hope that I can see it soon since it looked pretty good. Anyway, lets get into this representation of the God of death.</p>

<p>I think that he looks really great! The reuse of the Ghost Rider head piece is really cool and I can&#39;t think of a better piece to represent his look. His face print is great and looks just like the character. His torso is nicely printed and has duel molded arms as well as some print. The legs are a completely new mold and has some nice printing on the front, but is bare on the back. this means that if you want to use this on a custom minifigure but you don&#39;t like the print, you can just turn it around and use the blank side. His accessories are two flame pieces in trans neon orange. I like that they went with this color over the more common trans orange for this piece.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a great minifigure. He is not the most popular Disney villain, but he is still really cool to get. He comes with come great pieces that can be used on custom minifigures and I can&#39;t wait to see what people do with this guy in their mocs.</p>

<p>With another unique lower body part that will see very little re-use potential similar to Ursula from Series 1, Hades has a very simple print design for his torso, the folds of his toga carry down onto the leg piece he&#39;s using. His arms feature some side printing on the upper biceps and of course, we see a new printed face on the Ghost Rider head element. At least I think the head here is the same mould as the Ghost Rider flaming head effect piece, just with different colours. I could be wrong.</p>

<p>Rounding out Hades is two LEGO flame effects that he can hold in his hands. He did shoot flames from his hands constantly, but it might have been nice if these were dual-moulded to reflect his mood changing flames. Overall Hades is a brilliant addition to the LEGO Disney Series 2 and definitely one of the better offerings. Highly Recommended.</p>
