<p>Huey, Dewey and Louie&nbsp;certainly should&#39;ve been part of some set(s)&nbsp;as they&#39;re just recolour of each other. Making it very annoying if you had got some pack of these and all of them were just the duck triplets. Least it would&#39;ve been good to get Scrooge, who is in this series as well.</p>

<p>It&#39;s expected like with series 1 duck and mouse head, that they have a pin hold for the hats, that I wish they find a way to reuse it along with Scrooge&#39;s top hat.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;accessories for the 4 give us&nbsp;the book recolour, the CMF exclusive (aside from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71211-1/Bart-Simpson-Fun-Pack"">71211</a>) slingshot and a 10 cent coin. Louie got the short end of having a 2 piece flashlight.</p>

<h3>-VINTAGE MICKEY AND MINNIE-</h3>

<p>These figures were added to celibate&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21317-1/Steamboat-Willie"">Steamboat Willie</a>, which already have minifigure in the set, but these are&nbsp;had light grey instead of metallic (which I think should&#39;ve been the other way around).</p>

<p>It would be good if you couldn&#39;t afford the set, but the Steamboat set isn&#39;t like the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71040-1/Disney-Castle"">Disney Castle</a>, and they just take up space for other Minifigures like Goofy and Pete.</p>

<h3>-CHIP &amp; DALE-</h3>

<p>These two are in their no clothes look and&nbsp;not their Rescue Rangers getup, though sadly don&#39;t have pinhole to be future-proof for Chip.</p>

<p>Very well design head and fluffy print and giving us those medium legs&nbsp;when they could&#39;ve gone with the&nbsp;short legs.</p>

<h3>-ELSA &amp; ANNA-</h3>

<p>It was expected to see these two as Frozen was a big thing but good to get these two in minifigure form with their own hairpieces that sadly haven&#39;t been use in different colours&nbsp;out of them.</p>

<p>Elza have a very pretty design with a snowflake pattern cape. While Anna is equally good, but her sister is the star of the show.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t say the same for the accessories but good that they were included.</p>

<h3>-JAFAR &amp; JASMINE-</h3>

<p>Another in minifigure form and getting Jafar for the first time.</p>

<p>Jasmine reuse her minidoll hairpiece as it&#39;s a &#39;not broke don&#39;t fix&#39; hair and good for those who don&#39;t want minidolls.</p>

<p>As Jafar on the other hand bring in an accurate&nbsp;headwear and shoulder pads which replace <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-11438"">piece 71024</a>. They did a well job trying to show off his long face.</p>

<p>Two having very nice accessories of the snake staff and cute little bird.</p>

<h3>-HADES &amp; HERCULES-</h3>

<p>The two character could&#39;ve been made into a set but wouldn&#39;t have got the leg &amp; arm&nbsp;details otherwise. Extra Hercules could have him be used for Roman Soldiers as we don&#39;t get much of those.</p>

<p>I really love leg mould for Hades, feeling like they could be to for some other Demi minifigure that I wish could&#39;ve been seen again. The head even use the flaming head (that honestly should&#39;ve been a split&nbsp;piece instead of deal moulded) with his&nbsp;devilish smile.</p>

<p>Sadly Hades just have 2 flame pieces for his accessories while Hercules have that shield with the thunder printing.</p>

<h3>-SALLY AND JACK SKELLINGTON-</h3>

<p>These two certainly fit in here, Sally epically with the amount of detail on her clothes that give a fantastic look to her. However, the face doesn&#39;t sit right with me, feel like they shouldn&#39;t have gone with the standard small black eyes and gone with bigger eyes.</p>

<p>Jack looking really great in his suit with that bow-tie, however he is short and should&#39;ve brought back the long arm and legs for him (As well as for Woody)</p>

<p>Accessories are very lovely with the black flower and present with two different snowflakes.</p>

<h3>-EDNA MODE &amp; FROZONE-</h3>

<p>These two certainly should&#39;ve been in a line of incredibles sets, as they feel more sets than CMF, but are very good looking figure nonetheless.</p>

<p>Edna having her own&nbsp;hair mould with the glasses unlike her <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/30615-1/Edna-Mode"">polybag version</a>. Even have attention to detail of putting bangs on the printing.</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>The 2nd series to me took a noticeable nose dive with the choice of minifigures, it isn&#39;t that they are bad or anything, these are some excellent design looking minifigure. It&#39;s just that a lot of them I could see having sets made for them, but it&#39;s good that we got them in here for a more detail design.</p>

<p>I do recommend these figures to collect but wouldn&#39;t so much recommend getting blind pack of them because of the triplets.</p>
