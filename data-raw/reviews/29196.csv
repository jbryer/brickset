"Zapp_Brannigan","2019-07-16T04:10:39.96Z","Neat Little Promotional Set","<p>I received this set for free which came with my order of 10268 Vestas Wind Turbine. For a limited time (not sure how long though), you can get this complementary set on any LEGO order of $100 or more (also not sure if Pick a Brick qualifies, but I don&#39;t think so). This set is an &quot;Ideas&quot; set based on the winning entry &quot;Cosmic Rocket Ride!&quot; by mjsmiley, as per the Brickset description I&#39;m reading off of right now.</p>

<p>At 154 pieces, this set took no longer than 15 minutes to build, but the final product is wonderfully designed. The set comes with a child minifigure as well as 4 silver coins of the round 1x1 tile variety. You insert the coins in the red coin slot to the left and climb up the 3 steps to mount the rocket. Turning a knob at the back will cause the rocket to pitch back and forth. The mechanism is compact and consists of a Technic crankshaft attached to a tri-axle connector. The&nbsp;eccentric rotation of the crankshaft causes oscillation in rotation of the tri-connector, hence giving the rocket its motion. The rocket is very nicely designed and decorated, as well as the ride receptacle which is decorated with semi-chrome 1x1 plates and stars. The rocket moves smoothly for the most part, but due to imperfections in the flushness of adjacent layers of bricks, the mechanism may occasionally collide&nbsp;with the side wall, but after a while of breaking into the set the problem dissipates.</p>

<p>Overall this is a great addition to any LEGO city especially if you have the Fairground collection. Since this is a free set I have no complaints for what we are given. I hope LEGO continues to release complementary sets with every large set we order.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigure</p>

<p>Boy: The minifigure included in this set is plain but appropriate. He has a brown hair piece, a freckled cheerful expression, and a t-shirt with a space logo on it. He comes with short blue legs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set</p>

<p>The base of the set is built up nicely with dark blue steps leading up to the ride.&nbsp;A nice touch is the&nbsp;coin slot that comes with printed coins. I like the way the top is curved giving it a finished look.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The rocket ship it self is superbly rounded on the top and underneath,&nbsp;with colourful lights on the sides.&nbsp;The fins, tail and exhausts compleat the look. There&#39;s space for two minifigures if one stands.</p>

<p>The mechanism is the highlight of the set and it works perfectly, moving the ship back, up, and around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a nice looking little set and a perfect giveaway, but don&#39;t be too disappointed if you miss out.</p>

"DrFrankenstein","2020-04-11T03:11:01.583Z","Could easily be a store set on its own","<p>The Space Rocket Ride is easily one of the most memorable promotional gift sets LEGO that I have seen. The first thing that meets the eye is the catchy box that is pretty good size compared to previous boxes free promo sets (for example the Christmas freebies of later years). The instruction booklet inside is standard for the most part except that the first page gives some details on the ideas designer and background on the model. The parts come in two sealed bags which contain a decent variety of bricks in a number of colors.</p>

<p>I found the build pleasant and relatively quick. The finished model looks quite nice and would stand great in a LEGO amusement park collection. I really like the appropriately flashy color choices of the designer and the details on the rocket. The rocking motion mechanism is simple yet clever. The coin slot adds to the playability as well. Like others have noted, the ride is out of proportion against the minifigure, but it does not detract much at all.</p>

<p>My only minor gripe is that the two 2x2 corner yellow bricks in my copy of the set are a slightly different shade of yellow than the rest of the base bricks (look closely and you can see this defect even on the official LEGO photos above). It is an innocuous enough problem, yet raises new questions about the quality control of the current LEGO manufacturing process. If this were LEPIN or some other cheap knockoff, I wouldn&#39;t even raise an eyebrow at such defects, but this is a legitimate LEGO set, and I do expect higher standard.</p>

<p>Overall, this is a very enjoyable top notch promo set that excels on many fronts. In fact, I feel that it could easily be a catalogue set in the amusement park theme on its own since it has all the qualities. It&#39;s great to see the LEGO Ideas program consistently produce some of the most interesting sets in the LEGO lineup the last few years.</p>

"Pariah_","2019-09-04T14:03:31.053Z","To Space!","<p>I bought the Lunar Lander, in which I will be reviewing soon, and got this free promotional with it. It comes in the cute little box, not just a polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Building experience</h3>

<p>It&#39;s fun to build, and the mechanism inside is interesting, and is fun to build.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>it&#39;s kind of ordinary parts, though it does feature some rareish parts, respectively the blue cone used for the nose and 1 other navy blue piece.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>It has a crank at the back that you turn to move the rocket, witch is simple but works. There&#39;s also a coin box and some steps to the rocket, though I dislike the steps because the steps don&#39;t lead to the actual seating area. Speaking of, I enjoy how you can fit all types of minifigures inside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Value For Money</h3>

<p>Well, its free w/ $100 purchase and worth&nbsp;$12 so I think it&#39;s cool</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>A nice little promo, would like to see more of these lego ideas sets come to life!</p>
