"Gus_263","2008-04-13T15:52:56.967Z","Cool promotional including nice minifigures","This set is one of the small sets from the studios theme, was released as a promotional with Quaker Oats breakfast cereals in the year of 2001. As a promotional, of course this is a little set, so, there is few building involved, but some color schemes and pieces included makes it good for the size. The four minifigures included are nice and simple, have some itens like the caps and the hat (of the pirate captain). The cameraman and the other minifigure of the studio are good desined, and still useful, but better are the original lego skeleton and the pirate captain, also used in the classic sets from the pirates theme. Other itens, like the treasure chest, the colorful &quot;coins&quot; and the camera makes this promotional, a good set to increase other and also to have in your collection. Overall, another nice small set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"lotr_builder","2009-06-12T03:06:08.733Z","Cool!","Well, this one is small but great. I really didn't know that it came with cereal until now, (!) because I got it with a box full of sets from an auction. And it was a wonderful surprise when I opened it up to see this.
    The minifigures are great - and four of  them is a great deal. This set had my first ever pirate fig (hooray!) and this was actually my first studio set, and this DEFINITELY made a good impression. If you want some good accessories and minifigures, this set if right for you.

"Paco_the_Duck_Ninja","2010-05-05T17:21:38.483Z","A nice little set.","<p>This set apparantly came via mail with Proof of Purchases from Quaker Oats years ago, although I got it from my grandma back then. It's a pretty good minifig set that comes with a skeleton (always good to have) the old Pirate Captain (with Pegleg!), Steven Speilberg (director) and a cameraman. There are some nice pieces that you can easily get elsewhere in this set, although this does supplement other pirate and Studio&nbsp;sets well. It's great if you got it for free back then, but it's nothing to search for anymore.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,5,5
"TooMuchLEGO","2011-02-07T21:11:24.42Z","Just Plain Great","<p>I bought this set from Amazon for $8.98, and it is a great set. Though there's not a lot of pieces, it was worth it.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>There were no instructions for this set- and the box was a simple bag like in the minifigure series. The box art is all right though.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>So, you get a camera, a shovel, a pickaxe, a megaphones, a boom mic, a treasure chest, a glass cup (or looks like it), oh, and gold coins. The gold coins are probably the best bit in the set.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>So you get a Cameraman, with a camera. He's got a cool face and torso. The next fig is a skeleton. He's pretty basic. Then the director, who bears resemblence to Steven&nbsp;Spielberg. That's why I refer to him as Steven, not the Director. Finally, there is Captain Redbeard, the original commander of the LEGO Pirates. Awesome!</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>To be honest, there's not much to build here- just a boom mic, a camera, and the minifigures. DO NOT GET THIS SET FOR A BUILDING EXPERIENCE.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It's not much- just a treasure chest with some valuables and Steven and his cameraman filming, and Redbeard as an actor. But it has nice figs, like I mentioned.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall I really like this set. You get a lot of nifty stuff, 3 rare minifigures, and some neat little treasure. Not a bad set for 8.98. :)</p>",TRUE,4,5,2,3,5

No, really.","<p>I&#39;m a bit too young to have experienced peak Pirate-mania in Legoland, so I must confess I didn&#39;t understand quite what the fuss was all about when the catalogs labeled the Black Seas Barracuda and Red Beard Runner as&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;Legends way back when.&nbsp; But the&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;club magazine said that if you ate enough Quaker Oatmeal you would get a&nbsp;<a data-saferedirecturl=""https://www.google.com/url?q=https://brickset.com/sets/1411-1/Pirates-Treasure-Hunt&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1601328163431000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEsorzMfI1Z-xfZk6z6eshoHYhj3A"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/1411-1/Pirates-Treasure-Hunt"" target=""_blank"">free polybag</a>&nbsp;with a pirate captain, a treasure chest, a skeleton, and a film crew.&nbsp; Well, I wanted that pirate captain and Mom obligingly bought the oatmeal as long as I would eat it.&nbsp; After a few weeks I was pretty sick of sugary flavored oatmeal and I had my pirate captain.&nbsp; My brother had one too.</p>

<p>You can&#39;t have a pirate captain without a pirate ship!&nbsp; Our bins of basic off-brand bricks soon became 8-bit pirate ships built from 1x2, 2x2, and 2x4 bricks, amply stocked with hand-drawn flags of all the nations of the world to fly as false colors.&nbsp; Through a sequence of rebuilds, my ship went from &ldquo;The Fat Duck&rdquo; to &ldquo;The Duck&rdquo; to &ldquo;The Mighty Duck&rdquo; while my brother&#39;s ship returned to the scrapyard.&nbsp; His film director was unmasked as &ldquo;the man behind the curtain&rdquo; posing as the villainous Makuta on Mata Nui while really being nothing but a humbug; my film crew took up residence on a ledge overlooking my town as fly-on-the-wall filmmakers gathering material for a documentary.&nbsp; Eventually, the Duck was scrapped too because it was too fragile and there was no room for it after my room got rearranged.</p>

<p>With all the excitement over Pirates of Barracuda Bay, I recently found time to pull out the old bin of basic bricks and rebuild the Fat Duck from memory.&nbsp; With some genuine&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;plates to strengthen the hull and a new mast and paper-towel sail, the Duck is ready to assume a permanent place in my&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;collection.&nbsp; That is, if old captain Redbeard can escape the wrath of captain Graybeard ....</p>
