Surprised in two ways...first this is a chrome black Darth Vader and very very pleased. A larger replica of the 10th Anniversary rare polybag minifig placed in random sets of the time.&nbsp; The chrome black is striking and vivid making it stand out. Second surprise was the size. A bit disappointed as the picture on the LEGO Shop website makes it look larger and I was expecting a regular size minifig clock. Not the case in this circumstance.&nbsp; Approximately 5&quot; tall by 4&quot; wide, this is a small alarm clock. Playability is limited to a button on the top of the black replica brick that also displays the set time. Packaging has the 20th Anniversary print, making it a must for anyone collecting all of the Star Wars Celebration LEGO.</p>
