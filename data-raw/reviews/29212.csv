<p>On 24th April 2019 we were introduced to Special Agent Bold, Jeff Bold, as he came attached to Issue 14 of the Lego City Comic.&nbsp; Although he suffers with hayfever it says that he is a Special Agent for Really Serious Cases.</p>

<p>This edition also came with an extra set attached.&nbsp; For me this was <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/951809-1/Refuse-Operative"">951809 - Refuse Operative</a>, which is to date my favourite Lego City Comic set and as it was attached I picked up a couple more of this comic to get more of the crates.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>All the packets now seem to be the larger foil packs.&nbsp; This easily holds the 16 pieces securely.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Jeff Bold is unique to this set.&nbsp; A criminal to chase would have been a welcome inclusion, but the set loses nothing without it.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>The Mini Armour, W/ Knobs, No.1 piece was new for 2019 and appeared in 4 of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6248533"">Sky Police </a>sets along with here.&nbsp; All other parts are pretty standard.&nbsp; You do also get handcuffs and a radio for Jeff to hold.&nbsp; The jetpack can be removed easily&nbsp;as it&#39;s connected to Jeff&#39;s back by four studs on the new element.</p>

<p>It is a shame that they don&#39;t include a hair element for when he removes his helmet, but this is a minor omission.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>This is a very nice set that I imagine kids will love playing with, and thankfully a HUGE improvement on the last Sky Police offering which was frankly the worst of all these comic sets by far.</p>

<p>With the extra set attached to the comic the value was incredible.&nbsp; Two small foil sets and a comic for &pound;4.99 - what more can you want!&nbsp; It would be nice if Lego could provide us with someone for the police minifigures to chase as we have plenty of the good guys (four police figures to date) and only one crook who came with Issue 1 back in 2017, so we are well overdue another &quot;baddie&quot;.</p>

<p>The next issue shows a female firefighter with an interesting helicopter.</p>
