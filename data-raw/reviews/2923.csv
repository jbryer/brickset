This set was only available in Europe and I was very pleased with the ease of building and the many different accessories that are included with this set.  A girl will have HOURS, DAYS, ect of fun with this set.  I use this set in my classroom to teach my severely disabled autistic students to learn how to play with each other in social interaction.  I use the dolls as examples of real people and create dialogue for my students to mimic as well as have fun with.  I was disappointed that Belville doesn't make DollHouses of this quality any more.  They should go back to this quality if you ask me.  LEGO will always be the leader in this type of girls' toy.
