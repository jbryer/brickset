<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I will try to describe as good as possible my experience. (First Review)</p>

<p>First my thoughts on the Box before assembling.</p>

<p>The Box represents the 3 Dinosaurs from the Masterpiece Gallery which are very impressive when you stand in front of them.&nbsp;No photo can describe or show the real beauty of almost 3 Meter tall Monsters.</p>

<p>So honestly I imagined the 3 Dinosaurs smaller and less interesting than they really are when Lego said they are going to put them in small boxes and release it.&nbsp;I say that because of the Lego Houses previous exclusive sets. (Like the House and&nbsp;Tree House). So i&#39;m positively surprised from the Set when i assembled the first Dinosaur.</p>

<p>The construction experience is not as much repetitive as i imagined to build 3 times a Dinosaur. The Skeletons, the basis are pretty much the same but built every time with different pieces so the construction is pretty exciting. Even at the podiums they tried to change the little details so it&#39;s less repetitive as possible.</p>

<p>Personally it&#39;s the first time i build creatures like this so i am discovering the different techniques of mechanisms for movement like arms, legs and tail. And the Master builders from Lego&nbsp;surprises me every time with the different specific pieces used for other purposes.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also adapted for kids because it&#39;s a playable set, they are flexible and pretty solid. There are no pieces to fall off when you manipulate the dinosaurs.</p>

<p>I Had a lot fun for 2 hours, and I can expose them in my Room.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Negative,&nbsp;like always, is that It&#39;s quite expensive around 80&euro; (600DKK) no minifigures and about 14 stickers which is bad for an exclusive set,&nbsp;I think.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all i&#39;m pretty happy to have the opportunity to buy it because it&#39;s hard to find.</p>
