<p>Started on a Saturday...finished late Sunday. Had lots of distractions (2 yr old wanted in on the build, but he only likes to destroy).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mini figures are pretty plane.</p>

<p>Details of the castle are really creative and thought through. I had a hard time keeping the last tower together while building the set, but I found a way to&nbsp;overcome and get it solidified.</p>

<p>I hope to see this set in Mass production and I wish I would of bought some of the other sets fans created!</p>

<p>Hope y&#39;all enjoy it as much as me!</p>
