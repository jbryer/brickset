<p>Let&#39;s jump in!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every AFOL Designer set has a &#39;exclusive&#39; element in every box. I was under the impression that each kit had a unique exclusive element but I believe they are all the same as this one. It&#39;s a nice Technic 2 x 4 red brick with 3 hole axle and printed 60 years logo. This part is not included in any of the build.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48118171156_49b60acf21_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 531px;"" />They label the bags with numbers and a letter.&nbsp;I thought you&#39;d go step by step with Bag 1A, and so forth but you need to open all no. 1 bags at once. Was like that for any new numbered bags in the build.</p>

<p><em><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48115360316_fc8a4f026f_c.jpg"" style=""width: 799px; height: 518px;"" /></em><strong>- The BUILD:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>First Level (Basement)</strong><em><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48118284127_4ff42da6b7_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 598px;"" /></em><strong>STEAM ENGINE and ORRERY:</strong><br />
A <strong>steam engine</strong> is a heat engine that performs mechanical work using steam&nbsp;as its working fluid. The steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. This pushing force is transformed, by a connecting rod&nbsp;and flywheel, into rotational&nbsp;force for work.</p>

<p>An <b>orrery</b> is a mechanical model of the Solar System&nbsp;that illustrates or predicts the relative positions and motions of the planets&nbsp;and moons,&nbsp;usually according to the heliocentric model. It may also represent the relative sizes of these bodies; but since accurate scaling is often not practical due to the actual large ratio differences, a subdued approximation may be used instead.</p>

<p><em>Note: Some vials/flasks in the back behind orrery.</em></p>

<p><em><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48118294092_2d6152de85_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 598px;"" /></em>Front first level of building. Stairs (meant to be marble? and nice striking contrast color), stream, garden and rock formations for the base.</p>

<p>Note: Silver knob on the right with gear to turn the wheel and piston for the steam engine. Works smoothly.</p>

<p>Nice stream under stairs - <em>&quot;The way to knowledge is not free of obstacles.&quot; - Tbrick</em><br />
But more important is the garden depicting MENDEL&#39;S CULTIVATION EXPERIMENT with intermediate inheritance of four o&#39;clock plants:&nbsp;<br />
Gregor Mendel established the rules of heredity and is seen as the father of modern genetics.&nbsp;<br />
Intermediate inheritance of the plants produces mixed color (pink) in the first generation of descendants and a ratio of 1:2:1 of pure and mixed colors in the next.</p>

<p><strong>Second Level (1st Floor)<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48124997212_ab7c3f6182_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 598px;"" /></strong>Full interior large first floor library. Excellent details here.<br />
Microscope, secretary (quill and inkwell plus writing papers) w/stool, gramophone and note hourglass on wall (right side) near entrance.</p>

<p><strong>Third Level (2nd Floor)<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48139416937_e19bd59b54_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 598px;"" /></strong></p>

<p>Chock full of details and experiments on this floor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Chemistry Lab table with conical flasks, Bunsen burner, papers for notes, spigot and sink (which can double as a crucible?). Sextant against wall, wooden field camera, Double-Slit Experiment,&nbsp;Schr&ouml;dinger&#39;s Cat, wing sculpture (high up on right) and Pavlov&#39;s dog.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48135534582_726f4fa6a3_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 598px;"" /></p>

<p>DOUBLE-SLIT EXPERIMENT: In modern physics, the <b>double-slit experiment</b> is a demonstration that light and matter can display characteristics of both classically defined waves and particles. It displays the fundamentally probabilistic nature of quantum mechanical phenomena. The experiment was first performed with light by Thomas Young&nbsp;in 1801.</p>

<p>Here the electron beam gun is the pearl gold stud w/hole, the double-slit panel is the grill element and the white 1 x 1 is the screen to show the interference pattern.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48135411521_69e522ccda_c.jpg"" style=""width: 567px; height: 800px;"" /></p>

<p>SCHR&Ouml;DINGER&#39;S CAT:<br />
A cat, a flask of poison, and a radioactive source are placed in a sealed box. If an internal monitor (e.g. Geiger counter) detects radioactivity (i.e. a single atom decaying), the flask is shattered, releasing the poison, which kills the cat.&nbsp;<br />
The Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics,&nbsp;after some time the atom will be simultaneously decayed and not decayed,&nbsp;implies that after a while, the cat is simultaneously alive and dead. Yet, when one looks in the box, one sees the cat either alive or dead, not both alive and dead. This poses the question of when exactly quantum superposition ends and reality collapses into one possibility or the other.</p>

<p>Here the dark grey rod with knob is the radioactive source, the cone is the flask of poison, and the 1 x 1 white clip/square studs/ tan cheese slope is the cat itself. Depicting the cat either being alive (the tan bricks) or dead (the white &#39;skeletal&#39;) bricks).</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48139326073_b77cd95e46_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 598px;"" /></p>

<p>PAVLOV&#39;S DOG:&nbsp;Classical conditioning (also known as <b>Pavlovian</b> or respondent conditioning) refers to a learning procedure in which a biologically potent stimulus (e.g. food - the pearl gold dish w/rod) is paired with a previously neutral stimulus (e.g. a bell - pearl gold cone). It also refers to the learning process that results from this pairing, through which the neutral stimulus comes to elicit a response (e.g. salivation) that is usually similar to the one elicited by the potent stimulus.</p>

<p>Note here the camera has a weak connection with the cone into the centered anti-stud(?) underneath. But perhaps done on purpose since you can tilt it up and down this way.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48165832136_f3d124d2eb_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 598px;"" /></p>

<p><strong>Fourth Level (3rd Floor)<img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48154638021_9cd6eab9c8_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 598px;"" /></strong></p>

<p>We have on this level a radio transmitter and on the left hand wall a nice work bench w/drawers containing a scale, some weights for it plus&nbsp;writing paper/notes and a stool. Also a nice open round portal to access a balcony.&nbsp;On right (loft) notice a compass (printed graphics on it) which will be used to guide a telescope.</p>

<p>Note here is possibly an&nbsp;unstable part of the model.<br />
The dark blue floor buckles and comes apart (since one side of the 1 x 8&nbsp;brown plate is not attached to anything) when I pressed down to put in the stool. It needs&nbsp;two 1 x 6 brown plates underneath to secure it better (you must add this in from your own parts collection). I suggest putting those in first and build together with the dark blue plates before attaching floor to walls.</p>

<p><strong>- EXTERIOR:</strong></p>

<p><strong><img alt="""" src=""https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/48165380827_4cf3879bbc_c.jpg"" style=""width: 800px; height: 598px;"" /></strong></p>

<p>Here on the top level, we have an observatory with an ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPE:&nbsp;The astronomical telescope makes use of two positive lenses: the objective, which forms the image of a distant object at its focal length, and the eyepiece, which acts as a simple magnifier with which to view the image formed by the objective.</p>

<p>Also to the right we have a WIND WHEEL (<b>windmill):</b> is a structure that converts the energy of wind into rotational energy&nbsp;by means of vanes called sails&nbsp;or blades.<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;""> </span>Centuries ago, they were usually were used to mill grain, pump water or both.<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;""> </span>There are windmills that convert the rotational energy directly into heat.</p>

<p>The observatory spins 360&deg; with pearl silver knob in front, and the telescope can tilt up and down with that gear you see on the left of it. A little shaky but very smooth. The Wind Wheel spins smooth too with just a breath of air ;)</p>

<p>Note: A flaw in building order?&nbsp;The technique pin you use to mount the gears for the telescope within is not secure enough when later you have to put in plates to mount the telescope itself. It keeps pushing down and won&#39;t clear the top.<br />
Best to mount those plates when you put together the gears. Will save some headache time.</p>

<p>Nice technic built&nbsp;tree with smooth, polished green apple...NEWTON&#39;S APPLE! The tree beautifully balances the model and provides nice shade over the stairs.</p>

<p>Isaac Newton himself often told the story that he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravitation by watching the fall of an apple from a tree.<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;""> </span>Although it has been said that the apple story is a myth and that he did not arrive at his theory of gravity in any single moment,<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;""> </span>acquaintances of Newton do in fact confirm the incident, though not the apocryphal version that the apple actually hit Newton&#39;s head. I like to think it did ;)</p>

<p>Our two SCIENTIST MINIFIGURES!</p>

<p>No names given but for the guy, let&#39;s go with the designer himself and call him &#39;Doctor&nbsp;Thilo Brick&#39; and for the lady,&nbsp;I&#39;ve always been fond of Marie Curie so we&#39;ll call her &#39;Doctor Marie Greeble&#39;. They are stalwart scientists who on their spare time run this wonderful Science Tower museum and from time to time conduct experiments on their own here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have to thank TBrick (Thilo Sch&ouml;n) for his fun, wonderful model. I had an excellent time building and going over the &#39;experiment&#39;s&#39; more indepth with my son. Stimulated great conversations between us.<br />
If you haven&#39;t picked one of these up, I suggest you do and see if they are somehow still available through any third parties. You won&#39;t regret it.</p>

<p>Now TBrick has also provide FREE building instruction for a Science Tower City Site Extention&nbsp;to incorporate&nbsp;a courtyard surrounding the tower that will fit into the City Modular system. Check out the link below to his informative website on this model as well as a link to the additional free instructions within.<br />
