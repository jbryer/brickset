<h2><strong>The minifigures</strong></h2>

<p>We get 5 minifigs, which is absolutely awesome for a set of this size. Overall the prints and details are crisp, clear and look very nice. I love Nya&#39;s new dual-molded helmet with translucent top. You can place her inside a small hurricane cone, which is absolutely marvelous, I spent good 5 minutes just looking at it from different angles. It&#39;s a top quality piece with sparkling glitter mixed in the&nbsp;translucent plastic.</p>

<p>Kai minifig is more regular looking, but he has a nice small shoulder armor/weapon holster.</p>

<p>The ninjas can use a wide range of weapons we get in this set.</p>

<p>For the bad guys we get 3 Serpentines:</p>

<p>Char, who is clearly in charge here with his snake staff. He has rubber-ish tail instead of legs and perfectly detailed dual-molded snake head, and also shoulder armor.</p>

<p>The two lower ranked bad guys are nearly identical, sharing body pieces, which look like burning mummies. Both of them have snake heads too, but they are different, which is great: one has a hood and the mouth is threateningly open, another doesn&#39;t have a hood and his mouth is closed.</p>

<h2><strong>The parts</strong></h2>

<p>The part selection is actually somewhat more wide, than one could think. Yes, it&#39;s mostly common pieces, but we also get a fair amount of Technic pieces, including some most modern pieces. I was glad to receive 4 Technic wedge belt wheels in gold!</p>

<p>I also love the new gold&nbsp;wheel discs, and the large spinning shuriken.</p>

<h2><strong>The build</strong></h2>

<p>Assembling the set was fun, not too straightforward with at least one surprise (for me) of how the things will work. I couldn&#39;t see where it all was going, while I was building, and didn&#39;t figure how the shuriken will spin until the last pages of the instruction. I liked that little mystery.</p>

<p>There aren&#39;t any complex building techniques, in fact we have only a couple of places where SNOT was used. Also a couple of side&nbsp;panels are put on tilted Technic pieces&nbsp;-&nbsp;I advise to be careful here, as it&#39;s easy to leave them only partially attached. Another similar issue is with the hood: we build it separately, with tilted pieces too,&nbsp;and then we are supposed to place it on the car, but in my experience it may leave it not fully attached. I proceeded with carefully placing the tilted pieces on the car first, and then putting the hood on them.</p>

<h2><strong>The completed model &amp; playability</strong></h2>

<p>The assembled&nbsp;Katana 4X4 looks very cool, not just like an average vehicle. I like its kind of long and flat hull, elevated with large wheels. These wheels are not regular wheels too, with these new side discs. You put the tires between the discs, there&#39;s actually nothing inside the tire, except Technic connectors. I love the front radiator grille, made with swords and the cockpit with printed hatch.</p>

<p>By the way, the amount of stickers for this set is quite significant, practically every flat surface is covered with a sticker. We also get three plastic flags to put on a small stand, which is awesome, it&#39;s always good to have a choice.</p>

<p>Behind the cockpit the car has two large turbines with flames and a tiny tiny storage box. The rest part of the back is just empty, which doesn&#39;t look so great. This is the only noticeable flaw in this set IMO.</p>

<p>The car has 2 built-in projectile shooters in front, which are activated by pressing the hood.</p>

<p>Next, we have that large shuriken in front, and I mentioned that I wasn&#39;t able to figure out its mechanism until it was completed, so... This is a kind of building spoiler alert? He-he! If you don&#39;t want to know in advance, skip this paragraph. If you do, I&#39;m telling here how does it work. It&#39;s a super simple system with only one gear, attached to the shuriken itself. No more gears at all. The shuriken can be slided&nbsp;back and forth, using handles at the sides of the car. Doing so makes the gear touch a rubber piece, which spins&nbsp;it, and the shuriken. It&#39;s quite fun, because you can choose when you want it to spin, and when you don&#39;t.</p>

<p>As a personal thought I would appreciate having working suspension for this car, it could be done with a couple of rubber bands, LEGO already done this before. But, it&#39;s a motive to modify it, right?&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>Overall</strong></h2>

<p>This is a good looking powerful car with a couple of neat play features. It has a potential to be upgraded too, with your creativity. I would recommend it to&nbsp;anyone who likes Ninjago vehicles, as it&#39;s fun to build and play with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for reading!</p>

"CaptainCalamari","2021-01-08T15:41:35.207Z","Unimaginative, underwhelming set","<p>I&#39;m going to be completely honest. I bought this set for the minifigures, because the build didn&#39;t really interest me and I got it discounted by 20%.</p>

<p>This set has a great minifigure selection. 5 figures for a $50 set is quite good, and all of them are great.&nbsp;FS Nya is my favorite. She has an incredible gunmetal gray and trans-blue dual molded hoodpiece, along with&nbsp;a spinjitzu spinner which is the best individual piece in the set. S11 Kai is a good figure, but very common. Pyro Whipper is exclusive, although he only uses one unique piece, which is his head. Pyro Slayer is very similar, but he does not have armor and uses the cobra-style head. I don&#39;t mind the reuse of these parts. I actually think it&#39;s really smart&nbsp;when Lego does this with generic villain minifigures because then we tend to get a bit more variation, but they are still clearly from the same faction. Char is a superb figure that has 3 exclusive parts: a dual-molded orange and black head, a wonderfully detailed torso print, and a black rubber tailpiece. The only other set he&#39;s in is the $130 Land Bounty so this is a great way to get him.</p>

<p>The front end of the Katana 4x4 looks fairly good. The shaping is interesting and there are some nice stickers. The cockpit is excellent. There&#39;s a round transparent piece on a hinge that opens to access the interior. There&#39;s a surprising amount of room given that this only seats one minifigure. The best part about this vehicle is the spring-loaded shooters hidden underneath the hood. Just pushing down on the hood will trigger them. It&#39;s probably the best implementation of spring-loaded shooters I&#39;ve ever seen because they don&#39;t detract from the appearance of the vehicle and are so well hidden.</p>

<p>Once we reach the back end, there are some problems. The &quot;trunk&quot; that can store weapons is awful. It&#39;s positioned really awkwardly so there&#39;s a big gap underneath it that just wastes space. It&#39;s not very nice-looking and there&#39;s just no need for it. The flatbed area at the back is completely empty. You can fit a ninja or two there but it just doesn&#39;t seem like there&#39;s any point to it. The entire vehicle just doesn&#39;t look good from the back.</p>

<p>Okay, now we&#39;ve reached the most egregious offense of this set. The rotating saw function sucks. The gear attached to it is supposed to spin while it rubs against this rubber piece. It just doesn&#39;t work. The rubber piece is easily dislodged and is not held in place very well. The shuriken-shaped blade collides with the front wheel when you try to spin it. The function worked okay for the first couple of days after I built it, then stopped working. I tried rebuilding it and it still wouldn&#39;t work correctly. It&#39;s one of the most dysfunctional play features I&#39;ve ever seen in a Lego set.</p>

<p>So overall, this is a very skippable set. The build for the vehicle itself is not the best. I think we get too many vehicles for Ninjago, especially Kai-themed ones. There are some great things, like the spring-loaded shooters and cockpit, and some problems that really hold it back, especially the rotating saw. The excellent minifigure selection is not enough to redeem it in my eyes. If you&#39;re interested in a wheeled Kai vehicle, you&#39;re much better off going for the newly released X-1.</p>
