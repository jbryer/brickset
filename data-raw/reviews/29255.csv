<p>First off, the minifigure selection is fantastic. I haven&#39;t seen the show in a while, but from what I&#39;ve heard, General Vex is one of the main antagonists of the season, so it&#39;s nice to get him in a reasonably cheap set. He is the best figure in the set, as the duel moulded armour looks fantastic, and he reminds me of the ice tribes from Legends of Chima. Zane is exclusive to the set, and even if he doesn&#39;t have any fancy parts like the other two, he is still a nice figure to get. Jay FS is also exclusive, but I am a bit disappointed, as the Trans yellow is more green than I would have liked. (Thanks in part to the blue on the cowl) Overall though, this is a good way to get some nice minifigs.</p>

<p>The main build is a helicopter, but it is unique thanks to the angular design, and the bend in the middle. It looks nice, but some there are some exposed parts in the middle due to the use of Trans light blue parts, but these are easy to ignore, as the set looks fantastic. While printed parts would have always been preferable to stickers, the stickers get the job done, and the set stands out amongst similar aircraft.</p>

<p>The build is fine. The curve consists of an interesting build, and the propeller gimmick is more complex than I thought.</p>

<p>Lastly the gimmicks. The rapid fire stud shooters are boring, and a pain to use because of how easy it is to lose the studs. The propeller is nice, you twist the engine at the back to turn it, and the build gave me a greater appreciation for it. The spinner is also fun to use, but it took some time to get used to. However, the best gimmick is the spinning shurikens. You move the helicopter forward, and the wheels at the bottom make the shurikens spin. It is a simple gimmick, but it works wonderfully.</p>

<p>Overall I am pleasantly suprised by this set. I feel that people might not be too interested because it is another helicopter, but I think you should give it a chance.&nbsp;</p>
