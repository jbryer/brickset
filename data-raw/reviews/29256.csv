"CaptainBrick33","2020-08-26T12:44:18.897Z","A good oversized Ninjago Bike?","<p>Cole&#39;s Dirt Bike (or as it&#39;s known in the show, the Rock Cycle) is yet another big motorcycle released in the LEGO Ninjago theme. This one is actually very similar to set&nbsp;70733-1: Blaster Bike from the Possession line of sets. Both are oversized bikes piloted by Cole, both cost&nbsp;$19.99 and include one villain character to fight. This is the reason why many people overlook this set and just pass it off as another Ninjago bike, when it&#39;s actually a really good set.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>This set is packaged in a typical for $20 sets box size. On the front there is an action shot of Cole and Kai fighting a Pyro Viper on the Dirt Bike. On the back there are all the features of this set shown.&nbsp;I like that from this set wave onwards, the mascot Ninja is shown on the side of the box, rather than on the right corner.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Instructions and building experience</strong></p>

<p>The building experience is fairly standard for a set of this size. If you have built other motorcycles from Ninjago, none of the building techniques used here will suprise you. I don&#39;t remember how long did it took me to assemble this set, but it probably won&#39;t take you more than 30 minutes.&nbsp;The instructions were simple and easy to follow.&nbsp;On the back there no&nbsp;ads for the rest of the summer 2019 sets, which some people may find unfortunate.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There isn&#39;t anything too special in terms of parts here. There are no unique parts or new recolours. However, at the time of this set&#39;s release, the small rock piece with light grey printing (piece&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6268373/roof-rock-tile-4x4-w-angle-no-3"">6268373</a>) was exclusive, but has since been reused on&nbsp;71720-1&nbsp;Fire Stone Mech. Also, this set comes with the new for 2019 hood pieces for Kai and Cole, which is the cheapest way to get them. It&#39;s also the cheapest way to get the new wheel rim piece in warm gold (piece&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6264181/rim-dia-30-half-w-4-85-hole"">6264181</a>).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>In this set we get three&nbsp;minifigures: Cole, Kai and a Pyro Viper.</p>

<p>This version of Cole was very interesting, as it was the first one to use orange as the secondary colour (not including Airjitzu Cole). He has the new at the time armour piece in gunmetal grey, as well as the Legacy mask in black and orange with Cole&#39;s ninja symbol printed on the top. Underneath his mask he has two different face expressions: one angry and one smiling. On his torso there are some grey details with brown straps over them. His legs have some more brown and grey details as well as an orange belt. In addition, this Cole variant&nbsp;is sleeveless, which makes him stand out amongst the rest of the ninja team. Cole also comes in the&nbsp;Castle of the Forsaken Emperor set and in a small foil pack released earlier this year.</p>

<p>Even though the Rock Cycle can carry only one person, this set also includes a second ninja, Kai. Kai&#39;s colour scheme is mostly various shades of red with some dark tan sprinkled here and there. Like Cole, he has the new at the time armour piece in gunmetal grey, as well as the Legacy mask in red and dark red with Kai&#39;s ninja symbol printed on the top in keet-orange. Kai&nbsp;has two face expressions: one is angry with a closed mouth, while the other one looks happy/suprised. On his torso there are some pouches and straps, and on his legs there are more straps and a belt. Kai also comes in set 70675 Katana 4X4 and in the Land Bounty, which makes him a bit harder to get compared to Cole.</p>

<p>The villain in this set is a generic Pyro Viper. I like that an army-building figure is included in such a cheap set, since it makes it easier to get it in larger quantities. Pyro Viper has the same headpiece as Aspheera, but the warm gold is replaced with copper. He still has the transparent orange flames around his head, which look fantastic. His armour is fairly standard for Pyro Vipers, but it&#39;s still nice to get. On his torso and legs there are a lot of straps covered in flame detailing, which is meant to show fire bursting out of his body. This Pyro Viper is also available in three other sets:&nbsp;40342:&nbsp;Ninjago Minifigure Pack, Fire Fang and in the Land Bounty. However, a version of him&nbsp;without the armour comes in the Katana 4X4 set.</p>

<p>In terms of accessories, all of the three characters come with at least one weapon. Kai has a sword, Cole a hammer and the Pyro Viper has a copper blade and a shield.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The only build in this set is the Dirt Bike/Rock Cycle itself.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think that the Rock Cycle looks great. The colour scheme is pretty consistent, with various shades of grey, black, orange and warm gold. I really like how the vehicle has a very elemental aesthetic thanks to the printed rock pieces, which show that Cole is the owner of this bike really well. On the front there is a black tread with a rock piece covering the top, and the back has a giant wheel, which is the same one used on the Land Bounty. Some people may not like the tread or the big wheel, but in my opinion, it really helps to convey an off-road look. Unfortunately, to attach the tread to the vehicle, some blue Technic&nbsp;axles are used, which break the colour scheme violently. On both sides of Cole&#39;s bike there are some stud shooters and Cole&#39;s&nbsp;ninja symbols on the grey flag pieces. Obviously, Cole can pilot the bike with a handle placed behind some golden swords placed on the front. Behind the pilot seat, there is a white flag with stickers on both sides with the same symbols as on the rest of the S11 Ninja vehicles, which definitely makes the Rock Cycle feel more unified.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also need to mention, that this set uses quite a few stickers (six, to be exact), which many people may not like. IMO, the stickers add a lot of extra detail to the vehicle and none of them were difficult to apply.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Cole&#39;s Dirt Bike is pretty lacking in terms of playability, especially compared to the last Cole&#39;s Bike from 2015. Besides the stud shooters, there are no play functions or anything like that. I feel like the designers prioritised the looks and display more than play.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>While yes, Cole&#39;s Dirt Bike is another oversized&nbsp;bike, I think that this one is very well executed. If you already have a lot of previous bikes from the Ninjago theme, this one is an easy pass. None of the pieces or characters are exclusive and it&#39;s not too different compared to other sets like it. However, if this is your first set of this type, I highly recommend it. The Rock Cycle looks great and is a nice display piece. The minifigure selection is OK, but if you are looking for something more special, I would recommend&nbsp;70671-1 Lloyd&#39;s Journey.&nbsp;Overall, for a &quot;big Ninjago bike set&quot;, it&#39;s very good and you will definitely be satisfied with it.</p>
