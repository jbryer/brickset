It felt as if... we had reached our True Potential in an instant. It was a wonderful feeling. And a terrible one.&rdquo;</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In recent years, we have received a lot of the $9.99 sets for Ninjago containing one character and a&nbsp;build focused on a single gimmick. And of course, the Spinjitzu Slam sets are no exception. Even though the&nbsp;Spinjitzu Bursts&nbsp;are the newest in this series, I think that the Spinjitzu Slam sets are&nbsp;much better.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>I believe the packaging for the Spinjitzu Slam sets is the same as the Legacy spinners, however I am not sure since I never got those. They look really nice and do a good job at showing how the slam function works. Unfortunately, because of the shape of the box, the instructions get folded pretty badly, which results in them closing quite often while building the set.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions and building experience</strong></p>

<p>Since the spinner is built using a pretty big piece, the set is very easy to build. However, it is a bit more complex than the Spinjitzu Masters, as this spinner&#39;s launcher uses some Technic pieces. There really isn&#39;t anything too interesting about the building experience and there are no surprising techniques. The instructions are pretty simple and clear and I haven&#39;t noticed any errors.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Surprisingly, there aren&#39;t many interesting parts&nbsp;here. To my knowledge, there aren&#39;t any exclusive pieces to this set, but the minifigure parts were unique at the time of release. Also, this is the cheapest way to get Lloyd&#39;s golden sword.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The only minifigure included in this set is Spinjitzu Slam/Forbidden Spinjitzu Lloyd.</p>

<p>This Lloyd is definitely the highlight for me as, in my opinion, he&nbsp;looks absolutely amazing. Unlike with the FS Jay minifig, the green flames look beautiful on Lloyd and they meld very nicely with the gold mask. Speaking of the mask, underneath it we get a nice suprise, or two suprises, rather. This is the first time Lloyd gets a new face since 2017 and it&#39;s really good-looking. On one side we get an angry Lloyd face with gold flames bursting out of his eyes, and on the other we get an alternate face with Lloyd confidentially smiling, which was later re-used on Digi Lloyd. However, the primary face is still unique to FS Lloyd. Lloyd&#39;s torso is basically his season 11 gi but covered in glowing gold details. His legs are the same as the aforementioned gi, which some may consider to be lazy. I personally don&#39;t mind it and I think it looks fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lloyd FS also comes in a Ninjago magazine foil pack released earlier this year.</p>

<p>Like I said in the parts section, Lloyd comes with his golden sword, which was new at the time of this set&#39;s release.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Unlike the older spinner sets, this one includes not only the spinner itself, but also some obstacles for Lloyd to destroy.</p>

<p>The spinner launcher looks way better than the previous ones and instead of being a big handle with a ripcord, it&#39;s actually a launcher. If you push the button on the back, the spinner launches and starts spinning. Speaking of which, the Spinjitzu Slam spinner looks very nice, but unlike the ones included in the actual S11 sets, it doesn&#39;t have any glitter inside, which is unfortunate.</p>

<p>The three ice pillars are all the same except for what is on top of them. Two of them have creepy spiders and one is holding Lloyd&#39;s sword. I like the use of the Nexo Knights sword pieces used as icicles and the transparent light blue dishes, which hold the spiders in place. Besides that, they are fairly basic and there isn&#39;t much more to say about them.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>As is with all the other spinner/flyer sets (not including the arcade pods), the focus here is on the main play function, which I&#39;ve mentioned how you activate it in the build section. To my suprise, the spinner works fantastically and I have no problems with the function. Unlike the Spinjitzu Bursts, which open for a split second and spin for a few milliseconds before falling over, this one spins for a pretty long time with no issues. And thanks to the ice pillars, you can launch the spinner into them and try to retrieve Lloyd&#39;s sword or to &ldquo;fight&rdquo; the spiders. The only con is that if you give Lloyd a weapon and try to spin him, it is very likely that he&#39;ll fall out.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Overall, this set succeeds on all fronts. Not only does it include a fantastic minifigure, but the spinjitzu function, which is the main focus, works very well, possibly the best out of all spinner sets released before and since. The build is also good and looks nice on display.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So in conclusion, even though it was retired a few months ago, I highly recommend getting this one. It is my favourite Spinjitzu Slam spinner and my favourite Ninjago spinner of all time. If you are a completionist who wants to have every ninja minifigure, of if you are looking for a cheap set with tons of play value, definitely pick this one up.&nbsp;</p>
