"Blade","2008-01-14T06:09:10.56Z","Not a Necessity","I can't believe no one has reviewed this set so far. I know there isn't much to it but still. This is the easiest and cheapest way to get Johnny Thunder plus a bunch of accessories.

Johnny Thunder is in the usual attire of black pants, an adventurer shirt, brown wide brimmed hat and has a big smirk on is face. The only difference to usual is he comes with a big brown back pack that opens up and you can put a couple of small items inside.

On the green plate is the big brown crate and it's packed with stuff including:
Shotgun
Handgun
Dynamite
Magnifying Glass
Shovel
and a black scorpion as a companion or enemy.

Overall the set isn't much to look at and has very little playability but is a great way to get a Johnny and get a heap of accessories for a next to nothing price. Overall this set shaves in a 5 out of 10 only due to the amount for the price, otherwise it would be a 4 or 3. Not a must have but if accessories is what you are after or a keep the kids happy till we get home this is one of them.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-14T00:49:13.967Z","Big Box of Tools","This is a small set, and like some of the small sets, there is hardly any building involved.  The set consists mostly of a box with a variety of tools, a minifig, and a few extras.  Although there is no building involved, this set is great for obtaining the smaller parts cheaply, including the magnifying glass and the printed dynamite piece.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-11-23T18:32:59.997Z","Good for Supplies","Although this set has a small amount of pieces, this is perfect for anyone that is low on pieces. You get a rifle, pistol, dynamite, magnifying glass, and a backpack. I don't understand why the green piece is there, but besides that, this is good to get for supplies.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Valjean","2016-01-23T14:44:44.93Z","The archetypal pocket money set.","<p>Way back when I was a boy I recall being given this set by my parents. It was the first Adventurers set I ever received and was amongst the first Lego sets I was given. I hope you&#39;ll forgive me therefore if this review strays from being impartial. I believe at the time this set and others on the same scale such as the Royal King (6008) and Tribal Chief (6709) retailed in the UK for &pound;2, which seems a fair price.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box is tiny and displays Johnny Thunder&nbsp;in various poses with a desert background. On three of the sides of the box, a museum like background is shown. The set came without instructions (unsurprisingly).</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Given that this is such a small set, for the time it was bursting with new and interesting parts;&nbsp;namely the magnifying glass, rucksack, scorpion, crate and adventurers hat.&nbsp;I recall at the time being particularly enamoured&nbsp;with the rucksack, it opens and has space to store some&nbsp;of the equipment. Likewise the tiny working magnifying glass was also of great interest. The green piece is a slightly odd choice for the desert, but I guess Mr Thunder was relaxing down by the lush&nbsp;Nile that day.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Johnny Thunder [occasionally known as Sam Grant] is the main draw of this set. The printing on his torso is suitably adventurous with a khaki shirt, red neckerchief&nbsp;and revolver. His face sports a&nbsp;rakish moustache and a winning smile. In all&nbsp;he looks every&nbsp;bit the early 20th century explorer.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s rather self evident that there&#39;s no build to this set, being but a minifigure and an assortment of equipment.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>If we disregard the size of the set, the completed model is rather versatile;&nbsp;the figure could be used to excavate or explore&nbsp;most areas of the world due to the simplicity of the set and array of equipment.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Johnny Thunder&nbsp;was widely available throughout the other sets in the theme, but as an introduction to the Adventurers theme at a very low price point, comparable to the foil sealed minifigures&nbsp;of today, this set at the time really fulfilled its end of the deal. It provided a number of new pieces, a minifigure and sparked an interest in the Adventurers&nbsp;theme as a whole.&nbsp;It is quite possible to pick it up second hand for a similar price to that of the Minifigure Explorer&nbsp;(8684-7), I would however advise potential buyers to opt for this set though due to the variety of pieces on offer.</p>

I'd much rather have an extra Jungle Sub-themes River Raft than an extra of this if I had to decide. The mini-figure is one of the better ones of the theme and is a good one to have multiples of. Overall a semi-good set.<br>",TRUE,3,4,2,2,2
