<p>This is an interesting set for those of you that like set that represent outdoor activity. The LEGO&reg; Creator 3 in 1 #31098 - Outback Cabin set will be suitable for you that build city diorama or like outdoor adventure theme. This set depicts a father and son who enjoying their time in the outback by rowing canoe and fishing.</p>

<p>This Creator 3 in 1 Outback Cabin set is a model that I like, meaning this set has a complete building form and does not have any open section which make this building more realistic compared with some of the Creator 3 in 1 sets that were released lately (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31077-1/Modular-Sweet-Surprises"">31077 - Modular Sweet Surprise</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31097-1/Townhouse-Pet-Shop-Caf%c3%a9"">31097 - Townhouse Pet Shop &amp; Cafe</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31105-1/Townhouse-Toy-Store"">31105 - Townhouse Toy Store</a> just to name a few). Those sets have exposed sides similar with LEGO&reg; City and Friends building sets that some AFOLs will not like them since they feel the buildings seem to be incomplete. Fortunately, this set form a complete building.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/t/5fda1bcabddd201b330f3e5d/1608129497554/LEGO+31098+%283%29.jpg?format=1500w"" style=""width: 600px; height: 450px;"" /></p>

<p>As you can see, this set is consisting of two minifigures. A father and his son. Besides that, this set also provides a canoe, wolf, vulture and bonfire made from LEGO&reg; parts which is quite common in LEGO&reg; Creator 3 in 1 series. The animals made from bricks will make the set feel more special and interesting compared to moulded animal&nbsp;model.</p>

<p>The canoe built from LEGO parts has combination of light blue and dark blue which made it looks unique compared to the commonly used canoe colours such as red or yellow by the LEGO Group. The paddle itself is also made from LEGO parts and coloured yellow. The built bonfire is simple but complete with a grilled chicken thigh that attracts hungry wolf and vulture to the cabin location for sure. I am a bit confused where the minifigures get the chicken thigh since the inside of the cabin does not show any sign of captured wild chicken or turkey.</p>

<p>This cabin has a single fixed glass window, a transparent door, a solid door and simple fireplace. On the outside, there cabin is decorated with a wooden bird house, flower pots, stools made from log, moose head skull, lights and axe for cutting fire wood. There are two studs that can be used to hang the canoe and clip to hang the paddle on the cabin&rsquo;s wall.</p>

<p>The interior of the cabin is quite simple. On the ground level, there is a simple table with a small stool, a wall clock, a sink and fireplace. On the top level there is a mattress and pillow located in the small niche. The author wonders how the father and son will sleep. If you noticed from the previous photos, on the roof there are hinge system where you can open the roof on two sides. Though it does not have any significant function since you can only peek into the top level that has nothing beside the mattress and pillow.</p>

<p>I am quite happy with this set that it will match with other outdoor models of the Creator 3 in 1 set such as <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31048-1/Lakeside-Lodge"">31048 - Lakeside Lodge</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31025-1/Mountain-Hut"">31025 - Mountain Hut</a>, and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/5766-1/Log-Cabin"">5766 - Log Cabin</a>.</p>

<p>For Creator 3 in 1 set I usually only build the main build since the second and third builds left me with significant left over parts and they look less majestic. So I do not review the alternate build versions.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>It is fun, but too simple to my liking.&nbsp;The Lakeside Lodge set is more satisfying</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For me this build is too small.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This is fun for outdoor scene layout for city builder. Or you can let your kids to play with this set, and they will definitely have fun with this set especially with the wolf and vulture provided.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Well, this is kind of relative. I got this set at a bargain price. So the value for money is great to me. My advice is to always buy LEGO at discounted price whenever you can.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Special Note</strong></p>

<p>It seems the moose from the Lakeside Lodge has been hunted since its skull become a decoration for this set!&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Please note that I write this review based on my own LEGO Blog article which is available from:&nbsp;<a href=""https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-set-review-31098-outback-cabin"">https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-set-review-31098-outback-cabin</a></p>

<p>I hope this insight from me will be useful for all AFOLs out there!</p>
