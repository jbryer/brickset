Like the other of this subtheme, this was released in the year of 1999. This set includes the minifigure of a character from the adventurers theme, that is simple but nicely designed and detailed, still in a lego classic style.  The raft issimple builted, have basically a brown plate with some brown blocks under it to increase, still basic but the pieces are useful. Other useful pieces are the bag, the hat, the pickaxe, the map, the snake, the paddle and some other, useful pieces that makes it better in pieces. Altough it is so much small and have few pieces, all are useful and some rare, so, this small can increase some other sets and is a cheap option to have more itens for the sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I lost the fig a while ago, making this not able to be rebuilt currently. <br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-26T08:41:02.923Z","LEGO Adventurers (Jungle) - River Raft Review","This set comes with some useful pieces for future MOC's and/or brickfilms but it doesn't have many play features. The only feature is that you can sviwel the rudder on the back of the raft. This set also comes with a map, a red snake, a gem and a backpack where you can hide the stick of dynamite and the picaxe. We also get a minifig of Max Villano. This is the cheapest way to get this minifig so far. It's an okay set to have and it's good for pieces and for the minifig as well.<br><br>All
in all this set is an okay set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"AETerry","2010-11-13T10:30:26.003Z","River Raft Review","<p>Part of the Adventurers Jungle theme, I mainly picked this set up due to it's small size, pricing and the number of accessory pieces that were new in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The raft itself is really simple to build. One minifigure and a good number of smaller accessories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So this set really fell into the realm of an impulse item to pick up and get. But not too bad for it's size.</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,4

This set contains several cool pieces that are great for stocking up on adventurer gear. The mini figure is a guy named Max Villano, he is a well made figure with great features. The raft is rather small but it was a cheap set so I cant complain to much. One bad thing is the fact that it doesn't come with a blue 8x6 platform for water, but that is easily fixed. Overall a great set.<br>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
