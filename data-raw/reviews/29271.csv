Not the Best Price.","<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Set #41385 Emma&rsquo;s Summer Heart Box:</span></span></span></b><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;""> I decided to at least pick up one of these sets when I saw it at the local discount outlet for a good price because I was curious about the build, and also I like Emma. She&rsquo;s a fun character, but I digress, let&rsquo;s discuss this model.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Packaging</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">LEGO Ninjago has Spinners and LEGO Friends has Heart Boxes, the packaging for this set is the same style as the Spinners with a cardboard sleeve that can be opened from the bottom to find the parts and instructions. The sleeve is designed to hang on a shelf, it features a picture of the set prominently in the front a shot of Emma at the bottom and two live actresses on the front preparing to go to the beach apparently.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The instructions are pretty large. I mean there is enough space inside the sleeve, but it seems excessively large for what is in the set. They are well designed though with simple to follow along with instructions for the build and a very nice little checklist of other sets.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Parts</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">This set is loaded with awesome colours, teal, light purple, rose and they are mostly curved brick elements in order to make the shape of the heart box. This is actually a really nice set for parts in unique colours if you&rsquo;re looking for them. There is also a printed tile with EMMA written on it and with some nice design elements behind it which looks like something water related.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><b><span style=""font-size: 15pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""letter-spacing: -0.55pt;""><span style=""font-family: Courier;"">Mini-dolls</span></span></span></span></b></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Emma: Dressed appropriately for summer, Emma is wearing a very impressive dark blue ribbon tie strapless with a light teal pair of shorts and some white sandals printed on her feet. As with Moana it is a tad odd not to see toes printed on an open-toed sandal, but I suppose in the LEGO world LEGO Mini-Dolls don&rsquo;t have toes.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">For accessories she includes a pair of green flippers and a blue helmet with snorkel goggles to finish the look. I think this blue helmet is a re-use from NEXO Knights, it looks pretty decent, but it might have been nicer to include a hair element to swap out for her. The set also includes a heart jewel and a crab animal.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">Building this set is pretty fun actually, I&rsquo;m fairly used to making fun things in LEGO Friends Polybags like the awesome flowers and other non-Mini-Doll scaled builds, the Heart Box build is pretty clever and is designed to store the rest of the models to bring along and play at the park or a friend&rsquo;s house.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">The rest of the model is a very small underwater scooter which is pretty cute and a piece of plant probably meant to represent seaweed. I really dig the idea behind this set, it&rsquo;s like a polybag with an extra model to store something in. The heart box itself is just really impressive, love the design and the use of parts to make a legitimately proper scaled heart box.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom: 11px;""><span style=""line-height: normal;""><span style=""font-size: 12pt;""><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68);""><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,sans-serif;"">I like the idea behind this set, I don&rsquo;t think the price at MSRP is good. This is not worth 12$ Or 13$ with taxes. The 8$ I got it for at the discount outlet was a much better price. It&rsquo;s a tad higher than a Polybag, but it is a better value for your money. Overall I&rsquo;d recommend this set for the cute looking model, definitely recommended as a fun novelty set. I am going to enjoy seeing what the new square boxes do, but I may hold off until I see a sale because the prices are really a bit much for the content. Recommended.</span></span></span></span></p>
