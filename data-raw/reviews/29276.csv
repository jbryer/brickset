"lego_collector_123","2019-06-02T04:59:45.517Z","You SIRIUSly need to check this out ","<p>Harry Potter and lego make an excellent paring and I&nbsp;love that it was brought back last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;This years sets look good although surprisingly&nbsp;the set that caught my eye the most&nbsp;was this set, the smallest of the wave. I was&nbsp;disappointed not getting Sirius in a set last year&nbsp;as he is my favourite Harry Potter character, so from that point of view this set was a must buy for me, but the scene it&#39;s self looked fun and accurate to the move&nbsp;and the price was good as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>Harry potter: the hair piece used for 13 year old harry works fairly well although a new one would have made him stand out against his 11 and 12 year old self more.&nbsp;Both the smiling and serous expressions suit him but&nbsp;a scared one would have probably been more appropriate for this&nbsp;scene. His torso print is perfect and&nbsp;I&nbsp;especially like the silver trim. Medium legs work a treat and its great to get them in more colours, and he comes with the dark brown wand. Altogether a good, but not great, figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dementors: it&#39;s great to get two of these collectable figures in a cheap set. The hood pieces&nbsp;and&nbsp;the face print showing only their soul&nbsp;sucking mouths look great, and I&nbsp;like the tattered cloak piece&nbsp;as well. The torso&nbsp; would look better with more depth in the print but the leg piece look perfect, I&nbsp;love the duel&nbsp;moulding&nbsp;and it really captures the look of the creature. My greatest&nbsp;regret is the lack of a transparent&nbsp;stand to pose these figures in flight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sirius Black: definitely the standout figure of the set having only appeared&nbsp;in two sets before, both with the same version. The recoloured &quot;old Luke&quot; hair piece&nbsp;perfectly captures the look, and both the angry and neutral expressions&nbsp;work well. Its great to see a leg print and it flows brilliantly with the torso. Even the skin tone printed on his chest is done well and shows up brightly on the dark coloured piece underneath it.</p>

<p><strong>The Patronus:</strong></p>

<p>The stag Patronus is important to&nbsp;get right and i&#39;m not sure I&nbsp;like it. Most animals of this size have head articulation and as the stag is meant to charge at the Dementons&nbsp;this feels lacking, another nice addition&nbsp;would have been back leg articulation which it also lacks. The colour scheme of Trans blue with flecked silver look ugly to me, I&nbsp;would have gone for either Trans clear (more accurate&nbsp;but less impressive) or Trans blue with out the flecks. It&#39;s dual moulded&nbsp;so the antlers are made of a flexible material and are less likely to get broken which works well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The scene&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>There are many way to build lego trees and this one looks great. most of the tree is flat allowing for plenty of detail without many pieces, but two leaves branch off giving the illusion of three dimensions and letting you pose the Dementors mid&nbsp;flight. It&#39;s great to get lots of olive green leaves. A&nbsp;simple action feature lets you shoot off the Patronus spell but it doesn&#39;t detract for it&#39;s display value. The land and lake is tiny but serves it&#39;s purpose well,&nbsp;allowing two figures to be displayed easily and it looks&nbsp;detailed too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>

<p>When I&nbsp;come away from the set my main though is that no matter how many more parts you added you couldn&#39;t make the scene any better, more trees, more lake, more Dementors, they would be nice additions but wouldn&#39;t make to set more valuable&nbsp;to me. It was a fun&nbsp;little set to build, with a handful of rare pieces.&nbsp;It feel like a bigger set then the number pieces would suggest,&nbsp;and the price in incredible! $30 aud for a set this size with four desirable figures and a exclusive Patronus piece plus a nice little scene to display it all in is great value.&nbsp;</p>

"Watsonite","2019-08-02T17:44:32.533Z","Marked up minifigure set","<p>When I first saw this set I was drawn to it by the minifigure selection.</p>

<p>The stag, the two Dementors and Sirius Black are wonderfully executed. Harry Potter is but yet another Harry Potter.</p>

<p>The added trees and lake setting are a bit of an obnoxious build, choosing from complicated techniques for no real reason. And the stud shooter with the disk is a bit of an odd one out.</p>

<p>I can image there is some play value here but just for the figures who tell the story themselves. There is no real added value in the setting pieces.</p>

<p>I wanted the set for the figures and in the end it turned out to be just that. A marked up minifigure set.</p>

"lachiec1023","2019-08-06T22:24:01.14Z","A quality set with quality minifigures","<p>Overall, I love this set. The choice of minifigures&nbsp;makes this set worth picking up, especially Sirius and the Dementors. The Patronus Stag is such a suprising&nbsp;inclusion in such a cheap set, but it is a&nbsp;very nice addition to any Lego fan&#39;s collection. I hope they reuse this Stag piece to make an actual Stag for maybe a city set.</p>

<p>The only downside is that Sirius&#39; skin&nbsp;colour, showing on his torso, does not much up with his face. Hopefully LEGO at some point changes their methods of printing torsos and faces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A 4/5 rating is fitting.</p>

"Mr__BananaHead","2020-03-23T18:05:49.11Z","Great Display But Poor Price","<p><strong>Minifigs</strong>: The dementors are great as always and the Sirius Black is a great portrayal of the actor. The Harry Potter is okay but lacks distinguishing features to make it stand out from others. The Patronus&nbsp;is done very well and stands out in the set.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong>: The trees, while one-sided, do look very nice and there is a good amount of space for 2-3 minifigs on the ground.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong>: There are enough minifigs to recreate the film scene very well, but the one play feature - the stud shooter in the tree - shoots too heavy of a projectile to be very useful.</p>

<p><strong>Displayability</strong>: This scene is a very good display piece for even a tiny shelf. The dementors can be attached to the tree leaves, giving a decent impression of flight. There is just enough ground space for Harry, Sirius, and the Patronus to be able to be attached.</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong>: The set, in my opinion, is slightly overpriced, especially when compared to the same wave&#39;s Rise of Voldemort, which is the same price but is a bit larger. It would have been nicer had the price been $15-17.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-05-14T21:24:29.347Z","A good, cheap set!","<p>Alright, so let&#39;s just jump right on into this review, starting with the...</p>

<p>1.minifigures</p>

<p>So the figures here are really cool! Let&#39;s start with the one and only Harry Potter. Though he isn&#39;t exclusive, this is a nice way to get him without paying a lot of money. And he looks good, with that blue shirt and tan mid legs. Then we got an exclusive and pretty sweet figure, Sirius Black. He looks great, with his new hair colouring, new face, plus new leg and torso printing. Then we have the two identical Dementors, and they are great inclusions. The only way to get one before 2019 was the 80 buck Hogwarts Express set, so this is a nice inclusion.</p>

<p>2. The Build</p>

<p>So next is the build, and it isn&#39;t the best build out there, but certainly not the worst. That&#39;s really all I have to say about that.</p>

<p>3. Parts</p>

<p>As I said before, the parts here are sweet, with the figs and all, but that Patronus included here is amazing, as is the 1X2 glitter blue brick. I also like the glittery blue radar dish attached to the tree.</p>

<p>4. Playability</p>

<p>I do think you can have a lot of fun with this set, like how you can reenact the scene, with the launching spell and the rocks where Sirius sits.</p>

<p>5. Value</p>

<p>The four figs plus the patronus is totally worth twenty bucks, but the build, not so much :\</p>

<p>And there you have it folks! My full review of the LEGO Harry Potter Expecto Patronym set!!! Hope you enjoyed it!</p>

"8BrickMario","2020-06-15T17:59:12.86Z","A Siriusly generous set.","<p>I&#39;ve been very idly consuming LEGO for a while, and hadn&#39;t picked up a full set in a couple of years, but this brought me back as I was rereading the&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter&nbsp;</em>series. The excellent minifigure selection and value, as well as my personal love for the subject matter also made this a no-brainer.</p>

<p>This is going to get verbose.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>The parts selection here is nice, though not too flashy. You get some good olive leaf pieces and brown flower stems with pins, and some nice brown and grey pieces, as well as some green and blue plates for the bases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>This set is extremely nice to give us this minifigure selection in such a small set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Harry Potter is the same as his other renditions for the&nbsp;<em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em>&nbsp;sets, with the blue hoodie he wears a lot in that film. He has the new mid-length legs that can bend and sit while being shorter than the adult size...but I still feel that it makes him look too young for this film. I always viewed the young&nbsp;<em>Azkaban&nbsp;</em>cast more like teenagers than little kids, so the short legs given to the characters from this film feel a little juvenile. Harry&#39;s unchanged hairstyle also doesn&#39;t reflect the third film&#39;s quite as nicely. He uses the new wand piece&nbsp;which can be angled pointing forward in a minifigure&#39;s hand.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sirius Black is one of the characters the 2010-11&nbsp;run of LEGO&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em>&nbsp;passed over, so this is his first update since 2004. It&#39;s a marked improvement, giving him a more accurate hairstyle and color and evoking Gary Oldman much better. His robes also look the part, and you can see his chest tattoos. His face has a calm friendly expression&nbsp;and a harsh one, the latter of which suits his initial criminal reputation and his fear at the lake while Dementors swoop in.</p>

<p>Speaking of Dementors, this set provides two, making it no longer necessary to buy the $80 Hogwarts Express for just one. I can&#39;t understate how happy this makes me. This is their third version, and possibly the most ominous. Previous Dementor figures&nbsp;had skeleton bodies that trailed into spinal tails, uncovered hooded faces and cloth pieces that covered both sides of their bodies. These Dementors did exactly what I thought they would: use the&nbsp;ectoplasmic ghost tail piece to represent their tattered hanging cloaks. The moment that piece was revealed a few year back, I thought Dementors would someday use it, and I was right. The piece mixes clear and black plastic, though, since it&#39;s only meant to represent torn fabric, solid black may have been better. Their faces are now black to represent the cloth covering their entire heads, and have the hollow cheeks and round mouth you&#39;d expect. No alternate closed-mouthed face unlike the 2010 versions. Their bodies are printed with bones pressing through their robes, and their hands are grey, matching the film. Instead of a cloth shroud, they now have tattered capes, which are slightly less accurate, but still dramatic.</p>

<p>The final figure is Harry&#39;s stag Patronus, which is cast in clear glittery plastic. It&#39;s hard to approximate the glowing form from the film, so this is fine. Like most LEGO mounts, it has a gap where a figure can stand, and a brick and plate are provided to fill that space when it&#39;s not being ridden. Nobody rides the Patronus in the story, but it&#39;ll be useful when the stag is used as a normal animal in the future. The antlers are nicely cast in a softer material so they&#39;re not fragile. The stag is not articulated because the clear plastic would show off the inner workings of the pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The completed model</h2>

<p>The model shows the scene where Harry casts a Patronus Charm to save Sirius at the pond from Dementors. In the book and film, Harry is with Sirius when the Patronus is cast by someone he thinks is his father, but when Harry and Hermione enter a time loop, he realizes that he had cast the spell to save his past self and does so just in time. To this end, I think including two Harrys would have been appropriate, but if you have another, you can do so yourself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The scene consists of two trees, one of which is attached to a small outcropping by the water. Sirius is meant to lie down by the rock, incapacitated, while Harry casts the spell from the other side of the pond. The detached tree should be placed opposite the other piece of land for this staging. The trees are unusual builds, built primarily sideways and using A-frames for branches. They don&#39;t look great from the back, but oh well.&nbsp;The leaves provide numerous places to stick the Dementors to simulate their flight, which is great. The older versions, which could bend at the waist, would probably be more dynamic attached to the trees, but I still like the new ones more.The detached tree has a stud shooter to launch a glittery disc, representing the Patronus being cast, though this can also be placed on the knob on Harry&#39;s wand for display. It&#39;s a simple diorama, but it offers all it needs to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>This set offers fantastic value purely for including Sirius Black, the Patronus, and two Dementors in such a small set, but it also executes the film scene rather well and offers some interesting builds for the scenery. If you&#39;re at all interested in this set, don&#39;t miss it.</p>

"Corkscrew_Brik36","2022-03-29T18:46:59.963Z","I Expecto'd Better...","<p>Generally not impressed with this set. It is what you get for your money, I don&#39;t think I would have made it cheaper but what you get is rather underwhelming. The minifigures are good. A good way to get Harry and the Dementors, with the main draw being Sirius Black, who is exclusive to this set aside from a book. The deer Patronus is a great new mould, aside from a bit of flimsiness on the antlers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is the worst part: There is barely anything to it. I can&#39;t exactly blame them for being accurate, considering the location of this scene in the Prisoner of Azkaban film also looks this barren. The build for the trees, while admittedly interesting, seems a bit complicated and forces them to have more black than they should. The stud shooter on the left tree is also unnecessary. The playability of this set is about as playable as&nbsp;a plain green baseplate.</p>

<p>Additionally, when I bought this set a piece to the tree was missing and forced me to find a similar piece from my parts. When I attempted to get it sent to me by LEGO, my request was ignored.</p>

<p>At the end, this set is maybe not as bad as it was just a bad experience with it for me. Once again, the figures are great, they&#39;re the only part of the set I still have together.</p>
