I was in the process of wanting to buy it, when I rcieved it as a Christmas gift. I ripped it open not long after, and when I built it up I was a tad bit dissapointed, but nonetheless the set isn&#39;t entirely junk. So let&#39;s take a closer look at this set.</p>

<p>1. Minifigures</p>

<p>So the figure selection here is great, and the best part of this set. All 4 figs are exclusive, and they are all very nice. That being said, I do think that every figure here looks better in a different set in the 2019 line (excluding cedric who was in the 2018 Minifigure series,). First up we got Harry, who is my favorite fig in the set. You got Lloyd&#39;s (from the LEGO Ninjago Movie line) hair piece in black, a nice face print, black mid legs, and an exclusive torso print&nbsp;which looks nice, however the tri-wizard outfit in the Voldemort&#39;s return set is better. Then we have Fleur, who does have an exclusive and nice torso print, but not a new face. And I do think the Fluer design from the Beauxbatons Carriage set is better. We also have Cedric Diggory, who (like Fluer) has an exclusive torso print, but not a new face. And lastly we have Viktor Krum who has an exclusive shirt and a nice face print, but looks best in the Clock Tower set.</p>

<p>2. The Build</p>

<p>The builds are mediocre. The little shack has an okay look, but not much detail&nbsp; on the inside, so nothing much happening there. But then we have the main Hungarian Horntail dragon build, and he&#39;s just okay. The worst part about him is the horns fall off very easily, especially the ones on his heads. Speaking of which, the head is not new. It was originally used in the Newts Magical Creature set, so not new at all. The wings do look nice though on him. Then we have the little Golden Egg area too, which looks decent.</p>

<p>3.Playability</p>

<p>The playability here is decent. You can attach Harry to that Firebolt build and make him fly around, trying to catch the egg, then you could do it with the other 3 figs as well, so&nbsp;decent bit of playability.</p>

<p>4. Value</p>

<p>And lastly, the value here isn&#39;t all too great, with no exclusive moulds or anything, and just to be clear the price is normally $30.00, and if you ask me, it&#39;s worth twenty.</p>

<p>And I think that wraps this up! So thanks for reading, and I hope I was useful toy you!</p>

<p>+ Brilliant minifigure selection&nbsp;</p>

<p>+ Menacing and manoeuvrable dragon build</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>- The tent isn&#39;t particularly impressive</p>

<p>- The dragon does look a little bit undercooked, as if it&#39;s missing some parts.</p>

<p>Score: 9/10</p>

<p>Build Time: 1 hour&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
