<p>As mentioned by others, I mistakenly expected it to be a hinged building that opens up but was a bit surprised and somewhat disappointed to find that all the hinges included in the set are only there to help the &quot;octagonal&quot; shape (because you don&#39;t build the whole octagon) take form and give it rigidity. No doubt you can modify it into a hinged building if you want to.</p>

<p>The build was pretty straightforward. Nothing particularly exciting.</p>

<p>As the main triangular sections of the roof are each attached by only a single clip at the narrow end of the triangular shape onto the octagonal ring piece (<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6020990/parabolic-ring"">Element no. 6020990)</a> the completed roof is very fragile and even a gentle nudge will easily dislodge the roof pieces. I&#39;ve already had to rebuild the roof several times after each accident! Makes it rather frustrating from playability point of view.</p>

<p>Interior details are somewhat limited to various bits of furniture which are just put in place, with the exception of the built-in fireplace which is a bit of fun with the light brick giving life to the &quot;fire&quot;.</p>

<p>Of the minifigs, I love the bowler hat! And plenty of pumpkins for Halloween MOCs?!</p>

<p>So, all in all, interesting but somewhat flawed buildings. Definitely wait for it on sale if you want it.</p>

"Green_Bricks","2020-03-28T16:10:48.153Z","Best rendition so far!","<p>Before starting this review, let me just say that I like this set so much, that even after losing my progress first time round, I&#39;m willing to re-write this review to the best of my ability. The reason for this is that I believe this set is not worthy of the rating it currently has on Brickset, as of my time of writing. Everyone is entitled to an opinion of course, and naturally, this set is not flawless, but I truly believe that this is one of the best sets I built in the 2010s. That goes alongside modular buildings and D2C sets, for goodnes&rsquo;s sake! So, that being said, let&#39;s get into this review:</p>

<p>I knew quickly, upon seeing the new Harry Potter summer wave, that this was my favourite set. I mean, it&#39;s a building that&#39;s NOT a Hogwarts extension, so it&#39;s already pretty unique in 2019! Anyway, the pictures caught my eye, and I was very excited to receive it as a birthday gift in October. Although I&#39;ve become better in the last few years of LEGO collecting at saving sets up for a rainy day, I built this one almost immediately, and as I&#39;ll hopefully be able to convey to you, it did not disappoint.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p>For its small size, this set felt extremely pleasing and interesting to build. It includes a wide range of techniques that I am not used to seeing from LEGO, techniques which I usually come across in MOCs and which official model builders might see as unorthodox and risky. However, features like the two non-rectangular bases (non-rectangular is an understatement, they&#39;re octagonal of all things!), diagonal walls, sloping roof and a facade containing wear and tear really paid off. For a model that could&#39;ve easily been a grey lump, it went together in a way that felt somehow unique and unlike other buildings of this size. In fact, it is rare, in my opinion, to see a building of this size with so much care and attention. Creator Expert gets the spotlight, as well as the big price tags, and city is usually stuck with this kind of piece count, and ends up making a hash of it with a mediocre petrol station. For more affordable enjoyment, this set really hits the sweet spot. Even the stickers, which usually detract from my building experience by taking me out of the immersion, are all rectangular and simple to apply. Overall, very impressed with the build portion of the build, without giving away too many spoilers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Completed model</strong></p>

<p>This building excels in terms of building experience, and when completed, holds a candle to the other mid - large&nbsp;sets I have it on display with. As mentioned earlier, for what could have been a rectangular, grey set of four walls, the aesthetics&nbsp;are wonderful. Half the build has been cut off for easy access to an interior, which contains all the essentials for a small hut as well as a couple of references, such as Hagrid&#39;s pink umbrella and a copy of the Daily Prophet, the newspaper of the wizarding world. For something made of plastic, the interior looks extremely cosy and welcoming, and the light brick helps add to this atmosphere, which can be activated by pressing on the chimney section of the roof. The exterior, containing two huts of different sizes, looks great. It is covered in&nbsp;what you could call greebling to some extent, with protruding bricks and sprawling leaves. Even the stickers, which I sometimes don&#39;t bother with, add to the model significantly, whilst only being used in moderation. The brown doors are good examples of this; stickers make them&nbsp;look weathered, and add&nbsp;to the atmosphere that was already created by the wonderful building techniques, rather than heavily relying on stickers to create this atmosphere in the first place. The side builds, whilst not the main focus, add to the feel of this hut being incorporated into its natural setting, rather than a standalone structure, in-universe. The pumpkin patch looks the part, and makes sense, unlike some side builds that I&#39;ve seen in sets before (I&#39;m looking at you, weird exploding rock from 76080). So far, this set&#39;s been a hit, in terms of build and aesthetics.</p>

<p><strong>Figures</strong></p>

<p>The set continues to impress when you move onto the minifigures included. Without delving into too much detail, as they are not the main focus here:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Harry, Hermione &amp; Ron - casual clothes, exclusive I believe, mid&nbsp;sized legs (big thumbs up from me), accurate to Prisoner of Azkaban, very nice</li>
	<li>Rubeus Hagrid - new design for Harry Potter since 2018, visually impressive, manages to retain key features of minifigures whilst being obviously bigger than other characters, also very nice</li>
	<li>Executioner &amp; Cornelius Fudge - both fairly minor figures here (I doubt this will be a set that people buy just for the minifigures), but both very accurate, with a bowler hat, suit and grimace for Fudge, and a hood, mask and heavy looking axe for the executioner</li>
	<li>Buckbeak - probably most desirable figure inclusion, lovely new mould which shows LEGO going the extra mile, realistic feather design on wings, detailed face printing, great inclusion even if he jacks up the price a little</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The 3 Ps</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>P</strong>rice - definitely the elephant (or perhaps hippogriff?) in the room, and the only major downside, with a &pound;50 price tag for what should really be a &pound;40 set. It makes sense in terms of piece count, at 10p per piece, but with a lot of small pieces, and the only big inclusion being Buckbeak, I can see people holding back on this one. My only reccomendation would be to wait, as I have seen this set on sale for a desirable price many times since its release</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong>layability - you get 6 minifigures, an animal they can ride on, a side build and a main build with a fully fledged interior. It doesn&#39;t get much better than that</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong>arts - nothing particularly note worthy, other than the light brick, but parts like the pink umbrella and egg are nice, and the doors could easily be used in an urban setting, with or without stickers. Those pumpkins are nice too, and you get a good handful of them</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I think I&#39;ve done what I can, so if you aren&#39;t a fan of this set after reading what I&#39;ve had to say about it, I can&#39;t see you being persuaded much further. Like I say, it is one of my favourite sets from the last few years (you can take that with a pinch&nbsp;of salt, considering the fact that I started the decade aged 6!), and I&#39;m so glad that I can look at it now and admire it on my shelf every time I enter the room. As of now, I can&#39;t see you struggling to find it for less than &pound;40, so I say why not? If you&#39;re reading it at a time soon after release, it&#39;ll keep you busy in isolation too (can&#39;t wait for someone to read that 10 year from now!), so that&#39;s another positive. Anyway, if you&#39;re not a fan of the set, I hope you&#39;ve enjoyed reading my review, as I attempt to convey my passion for this set, and as lockdown continues, hopefully I&#39;ll keep on pumping reviews out! Bye&nbsp;for now :-)</p>

"8BrickMario","2020-06-20T18:42:20.843Z","One life of two can be saved tonight...","<p>After getting back into LEGO and the Wizarding World, this set was next on my list. It was the best way to get a standard Hagrid, included a new Buckbeak, and a nice model. The set depicts the scene(s) from&nbsp;<em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em>&nbsp;where Buckbeak&#39;s execution is began and then stopped by a time-traveling Harry and Hermione.</p>

<p>This is not to be a quick review. You have been warned.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The parts for the set are pretty nice. There are octagonal Technic corner frames in the roof segments, some foliage parts and some new uncarved pumpkin pieces. There are also some nice accessories in the hut.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Rubeus Hagrid </strong>has been using largely the same base in all of his previous figures, with only the decoration changing and&nbsp;moveable hands being added in the second version. This new Hagrid is completely different, only sharing the standard minifigure head mold. Previous Hagrids were three pieces, with a chunky one-piece body, a head, and a rubber hair and beard piece. This new Hagrid goes together more like a typical minifigure, with a separate torso and legs, and arms that plug in with Technic pins. The torso piece is fairly hollow, and thinner and smoother than the old Hagrids&#39;, only featuring molded detail for the hip pockets.&nbsp;This makes it feel more like a standard minifigure and allowed them to use the same piece for the very different fur coat outfit he wears in the Beauxbatons Carriage set. The top of the torso is completely flat, like a standard minifigure, whereas old Hagrids&#39; heads were pushed down into the shoulders a little, vastly reducing the hairpieces they could wear. The new arms&nbsp;match the thick sleeves and arms of Hagrid&#39;s proportions much better. The hands are standard minifigure hands, not the ones with sculpted fingers old Hagrids had. They&#39;re a bit squeaky in the arms.&nbsp;Hagrid&#39;s legs are the shortest&nbsp;minifigure legs and&nbsp;plug into the long torso to simulate them poking out of the coat. His face is more detailed than before, and looks great with the new hard-plastic&nbsp;hair/beard piece, which matches the color and shape of the film character&#39;s much better. Hagrid has the new lantern piece which is filled by a 1x1 round translucent yellow brick.</p>

<p>This new Hagrid is almost perfect, but I think it&#39;s a shame that he&#39;s smaller than the older versions. His torso isn&#39;t as thick, and his legs make him shorter. Giving him the mid-length legs would have made him the right height and given him more articulation, and they don&#39;t mess up the proportions. He&#39;s a huge improvement, just not in every single way.</p>

<p><strong>The Minister of Magic<em>&nbsp;</em></strong>is Cornelius Fudge, the weak-willed man who was convinced to order the execution of Buckbeak the hippogriff.&nbsp;Fudge looks appropriately stern, though I remember him more as friendly and then, stubborn. He has his signature bowler hat, and his torso and legs are printed with his formal robes. He&#39;s very simple, but good.</p>

<p><strong>The Executioner</strong>&nbsp;is Walden Macnair, revealed later to be a Death Eater in the books. He has a scary medieval-looking costume with a black hood and tunic. Under the hood, his head is printed with the point of a tighter-fitting hood, leaving a different display option. Macnair is given an axe whose blade is extended with a figure skate piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Harry Potter</strong>&nbsp;is the same as the other&nbsp;<em>Azkaban</em>&nbsp;renditions, and I&#39;m still not sure the mid-length legs should have been used past&nbsp;<em>Chamber of Secrets</em>. It&#39;s better at least than the&nbsp;<em>Azkaban</em>&nbsp;Hogwarts Express set confusingly using the shortest legs and child faces for the trio. It&#39;s the same ensemble, and he has his wand.</p>

<p><strong>Ron Weasley</strong>&nbsp;looks pretty good. His hair is a good choice for the character, and his face has a nice weak smile and a grumpy expression. His outfit is a simple maroon sweater (Ron&#39;s least favorite color) over a red shirt, but it&#39;s rendered really nicely. He has grey mid-length legs and his wand.</p>

<p><strong>Hermione Granger</strong>&nbsp;is alright. Her hair, reusing Wonder Woman&#39;s, is a pretty good choice, and she&#39;s wearing the pink hoodie she wears in the film, with the Time-Turner necklace being visible. However neither her smiling or angry faces remind me at all of Emma Watson, and though she had freckles, I think they&#39;re distracting and take away from the resemblance. I also think her mid-length blue legs are too bright for jeans. Either sand or dark blue would have looked better.</p>

<p><strong>Buckbeak</strong>&nbsp;hasn&#39;t had a molded figure since 2004, and this is a much better rendition and more up-to-date with LEGO&#39;s current style. The light grey color is a good approximation of the light blend of feathers in the film, and like before, his head is articulated so he can bow in the hippogriff greeting ritual. He uses the newer wing pieces, which look great, and a figure can ride on his back. They missed a trick by not articulating his back legs, though, since he can&#39;t rear up and attack Draco Malfoy, the action that got him sentenced to death.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Anything missing?</strong></p>

<p>This is an excellent figure selection, and I&#39;m not going to ask for a second Harry and Hermione to complete the time loop. However, I think Dumbledore and Ron&#39;s rat, Scabbers, are notably absent. Dumbledore was there to witness the execution and stall it so the time-traveling Harry and Hermione could free Buckbeak the second time around, and the discovery of Scabbers hiding in the hut was a critical moment in both visits to this scene. Their presence feels missed.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p><em>Prisoner of Azkaban</em>&nbsp;inexplicably changed Hagrid&#39;s hut to a two-chambered design, and this is the first minifigure-scale rendition of that version. The hut is not a complete facade, offering a little over half of the exterior, while leaving the back open. Closing the hut is not a simple matter of placing another copy back-to-back. The large chamber is the main entrance, which looks nice. Some SNOT building is used to construct the doorframe, which I enjoy. Inside, the furniture is all placed on round jumper tiles, allowing it to easily be removed and replaced. There&#39;s an armchair, a crate, a sack, a fireplace, and a table with two chairs. The crate contains a shovel and the pink umbrella Hagrid&#39;s wand pieces are hidden in. Now that there&#39;s a sculpted umbrella accessory, that piece is used. Before, it was constructed with a bar and cones. The fireplace is built into the house, and conceals a light brick that can be activated by pressing on the roof above it. This lights it up nicely, and the cauldron heating up the Norwegian Ridgeback&nbsp;dragon egg is included, though this is from the first book/film and occurred in a different design for the hut. It&#39;s still a welcome detail. Hanging from the rafters are more tools, like a bucket, a curled whip, a spoon, and a frying pan. The whip in black and the pan in gold are pieces I haven&#39;t seen before. The table is a simple build, and on it is a teapot. I&#39;m delighted to finally have this piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other side of the hut is smaller, and features a small desk with a candle and a&nbsp;<em>Daily Prophet</em>&nbsp;newspaper, as well as a trunk with a Chocolate Frog in it. One of the new spider pieces is attached to the rafters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two chambers of the hut attach with Technic pins, so if you wanted to leave off the smaller one for a &quot;films 1 and 2&quot; version, you&#39;re perfectly able to.</p>

<p>The other build is the pumpkin patch where Buckbeak has been chained. It&#39;s very simple, but looks good. The harness for Buckbeak&#39;s neck is cleverly composed of handlebars and a short chain that crosses the handles, which can be detached to put it around Buckbeack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think this set looks pretty good on display, but I am slightly disappointed by its size. I think it&#39;s partially correct, but still feels a little too small. Maybe the incomplete facade is causing that, but I don&#39;t know.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>I think this set does a lot right. The figure selection is very good and demonstrates some improvements from the previous versions of this theme, and the set is attractive, cleverly built, and offers a scene and a version of this hut we haven&#39;t seen before. I think this set complements the Expecto Patronum one very well, since both are part of the Time-Turner sequence. However, I can&#39;t call the minifigures perfect and the cast of characters doesn&#39;t feel complete. The model is a little small for my tastes, as well. I&#39;m very happy to have the set, no question about it, but I can&#39;t call it perfect.</p>

"sideswinger","2020-06-16T17:14:04.613Z","one magical set!","<p>So I got this set for my birthday, and i was hyped to open it up and build it, as always. And once I did open it and build it, I was very happy with it. But there was one thing wrong...</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start by discussing the figures. 4 out of 6 have exclusive designs, so the figures aren&#39;t bad. Hermione is probably my fav of the figures here, mostly from her hair and torso. We also got a nice Ron figure, and the Executioner is an exclusive character, and one who has never appeared in any sets before 2019. And if I&#39;m not mistaken, the Minister of Magic fig is also exclusive. Like I said, Harry and Hagrid aren&#39;t exclusive, but I don&#39;t mind because they&#39;re great figures. And then we got Buckbeak, and he is just awesome, with the new mould and all.</p>

<p>And next we have the build, which is not disappointing at all. I like the little pumpkin patch build which is pretty cute, but then the actual hut build is amazing. It&#39;s totally the best hut build up to date, if you ask me. I just love the exterior, but then the interior is great too, with all the screen-accurate details, like the chair and table. There&#39;s also the light brick lay feature too, which is pretty cool. It doesn&#39;t make a ton of sense to me why it&#39;s included, but hey! Why not?!</p>

<p>And lastly, the price...ouch. Sixty bucks?! Wow! Yes, this is a good set, but not a sixty dollar good set. Maybe forty, but sixty? Even fifty would&#39;ve been steep. But at the end of the day I can&#39;t complain too much because well...i didn&#39;t pay for it ;)</p>

<p>And overall, this set is a pretty good set, with fantastic figures, fantastic builds, and a not-very-good price. So I think that wraps up this review!</p>

"Framona_13","2022-03-22T09:53:20.157Z","Lego Harry Potter Hagrid's Hut Buckbeak's Rescue Review","<p><strong>Build:</strong></p>

<p>We get one side build and one main build&nbsp;for this set. I&#39;m going to start with the side build first and then go up to the main build as we go along this review.</p>

<p>The side build is a pumpkin patch which doubles as a sort of trap (I would say a holder, but it doesn&#39;t make much sense)&nbsp;for Buckbeak to remain trapped within said pumpkin patch. There are three big leaf pieces with pumpkin moulds and orange minifigure heads representing pumpkins built on top of the leaves. We also have a wooden pole, two chains and a bicycle handle representing holding Buckbeak back in place leaving him stuck in the pumpkin patch (poor creature :[ ) This is fairly easy to attach and re attach, although it is a tight fit for poor Buckbeak. The pumpkins give much needed colour to the set (I think this is what makes the set for me, if it was not there it would not be my favourite set of all time). In my opinion, this set is the perfect balance of light and dark, which if it was Lego&#39;s intention, they succeeded immensely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What was weird about this was that it was left to the end of the instructions. This was my third Lego Harry Potter set and as a Lego Friends collector previously, all the side builds were built first. Not anything affecting the review, but just an observation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now onto the main build. It is the titular Hagrid&#39;s Hut. The exterior and the interior both have much to offer in terms of display and play. The exterior perfectly reflects Hagrid&#39;s Hut from the movie Prisoner of Azkaban onwards, with its alternating light grey, dark grey and dark tan bricks and two buildings. There is also a chimney which doubles as a play feature (more about that in the interior of the set).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The interior is really quaint, just like Hagrid himself. The LEGO designers really managed to capture his essence as a character. In the first building, it is crowded but also leaves a bit of space (presumably to let little fingers pass through for children to play with). The first (and largest) building includes an armchair, a table with two chairs and a teapot, an umbrella stand and a fireplace with a dragon egg inside it. Now, as Harry Potter fans know, dragon eggs should be kept warm by a lit fire. This is where the chimney play feature comes in. Press down on the chimney, and with an object called a Light Brick, the fireplace lights up!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second building, on the other hand, is barer than the first one, but still manages to deliver substantial details. There is a desk with a newspaper (the Daily Prophet) with a candle illuminating the room, and a chest containing a chocolate frog.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall the build was the perfect mix of easy and challenging, which makes it intermediate. It is also very rewarding once you finish the build and look at it in admiration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Rubeus Hagrid</strong>&nbsp;- Undeniably, we had to have Hagrid. I mean...it&#39;s his hut, so. Anyway, he looks just like he does in the films, with his coat and a lantern, as well as the iconic beard. He has short legs which is unfortunate because he cannot bend his legs like the other minifigures, which means that he has to stand up in his own house (credits to the YouTuber EllieV for making me realise this). Overall, he&#39;s amazing, but not exclusive to this set (found in the Great Hall of 2018)</li>
	<li><strong>Harry Potter&nbsp;</strong>- We get a Harry in every single Lego Harry Potter set (I mean, it&#39;s his series). However, this is a casual version of his usual self, based on the final part of Prisoner of Azkaban. He sports a denim jacket and a baby blue shirt underneath. I love the details on his torso. He also has mid legs, which are coloured tan. He comes with a wand for an accessory.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Executioner (Macnair)&nbsp;</strong>- With an axe for an accessory and a hood over a black minifgure head, this character looks menacing in the best way. Here they managed to keep the magical form of Harry Potter Lego sets but made him creepy at the same time.</li>
	<li><strong>Cornelius Fudge (Minister for Magic)&nbsp;</strong>- The Minister of Magic comes with a bowler hat as a head accessory. I love this. I also love the printing on his suit and how the printing continues on the pants as well as the torso.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Ron Weasley&nbsp;</strong>- This is a casual version of his usual self, based on the final part of Prisoner of Azkaban. He is wearing a red pullover. I love the details on his torso, especially the V-Neck. He also has mid legs, which are coloured grey. He comes with a wand for an accessory.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Hermione Granger&nbsp;</strong>- This is also a casual version of her&nbsp;usual self, based on the final part of Prisoner of Azkaban. She sports a baby pink denim jacket and a hot pink&nbsp;shirt underneath. I love the details on her&nbsp;torso, especially as she has the Time Turner printed on her torso!&nbsp;She also has mid legs, which are coloured bright blue. She comes with a wand for an accessory.&nbsp;</li>
	<li><strong>Buckbeak</strong>&nbsp;- This is not really a minifigure, but a moulded figure. They did a great job on this magical creature. The HIppogriff can actually bow, just like in the book and movie! The wings can also move up and down. In the centre, you have a 2x2 studded brick, which means you can stick a minifigure onto Buckbeak.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>This is my favourite set of all time, despite the movie of which it is based on is my second favourite.&nbsp; Maybe that is why I am a little biased throughout this review. Did I get this at double the price because my country does not have a Lego Store? Yes. Is it an amazing set? Also yes. You have a decent selection of exclusive and main characters, the build is intermediate and you have enough elements to create stories.&nbsp;Get this ASAP if you do not have it.</p>
