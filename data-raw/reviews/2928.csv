"Novelty","2007-05-05T04:48:01.187Z","Snakes on a Raft","The idea for this set is nice - a raft with an adventurer, an oar his map and backpack, and a snake for the adversary.  Building the raft though is simple and it doesn't really look like a raft.  Other than the raft, there's not much building in this set.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

Three pieces make up the main body of the raft. This mini figure is hard to find in any other Adventurers set. Great set for a great price.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

My mom bought a bunch of them for my friends as Party favors on my 6th birthday, and I wound up with around 3. It contains many interesting pieces like a map, snake, gem etc. and a swarthy Mexican guy with a nice torso&amp;rifle. The raft is rather bland, but then again, how detailed can a raft get? This set is a fine addition to any collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

It is very hard to find sets from ten years ago in the stores, actually, it can't be found at toy stores now, just in stores where are sold old toys. It costed like what an impulse set costs in the place where I live. I thought it would not worth very well, but actually it is like an impulse, but from the Adventurers theme, something very classic. And it have 18 pieces, very few, but it have even more pieces than some current impulses!

With this simple set, we can get some useful contents. A snake, one of the best minifigures from the theme (his name is Max Villano), a crystal, a bag, a pickaxe, a dynamite (in plate form, in the way it fits perfectly with minifig schale), a map, a hat and more. 

So, most of the parts of the sets are itens for minifigures. The building isn't good with this, because the building is not the idea of the set. For playability it is good as well, the itens in this set can't be used by just one minifigure.

Now, with the Pirates theme again, I think TLG could take the idea of the raft (something simple to build) to make more impulses, something like this set. For what this set is, it is a 5/5. In my opinion, it is worth getting sets like this!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
