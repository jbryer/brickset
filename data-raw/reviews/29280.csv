<p>Personally, I find this is one of the more difficult sets to evaluate. I like the looks of the bus, it is an important subject within the Harry Potter universe, the price per part is good (especially for licensed sets), there are two unique minifigures and a unique minifigure head, yet somehow it feels overpriced and lacking &#39;something.&#39; Similarly, I feel like I should yet somehow cannot simply recommend this set.</p>

<h2>Build experience</h2>

<p>The build of this bus is simple and quite&nbsp;straightforward. It took me about an hour to build this set at a very leisurely pace. The stickers are easy to apply, though take care - it is very visible if they are applied crookedly. As such I simply cannot see why the age is given as 8+.</p>

<p>The most interesting part of this build was constructing the front of the bus:&nbsp;the driver&#39;s cabin and the engine. Putting together the windows can become a bit tedious, because there are so many of them. Apparently the windows are a completely new element. Personally I hope we will see a recolour in a less garish colour, as in this colour they might be less useful in MOCs.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are three minifigures in this set: Harry, Stan Shunpike and Ernie Prang. The latter two are unique to this set.&nbsp;Harry is the most common minifigure, found in two other sets (<strong>set 75945 Expecto Patronum</strong> and <strong>set 75947&nbsp;Hagrid&#39;s Hut: Buckbeak&#39;s rescue</strong>). He has the mini movable legs, a wand, and a simple but nicely detailed print of a blue shirt with a dark blue vest. The two face prints are well done, and contrast nicely: happy and sad/frightened.</p>

<p>Stan Shunpike is the bus conductor. The print on&nbsp;his torso is highly detailed,&nbsp; showing his shabby jacket, shirt and the ticket machine. IMHO it is well done, and I like it. The print of his hat is slightly out of register, it seems. I am not sure about his face print. I like the fact that he is unshaven, but the facial expression as a whole seems more angry or frustrated rathert han completely disinterested in his customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ernie Prang, the driver wears nicely printed vest over his shirt, with some fine detail in the print. I like his hair piece. I am not too sure about his face print either. I like the subtle beard, but his facial expression seems to show fear or worry... which somehow does not seem to fit this minifigure.</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>IMHO the build of the Knight Bus is a little of a mixed baf. Somehow I feel it is just a little too small.&nbsp; There is barely room for two passengers on the whole bus, Stan Shunpike cannot stand inside (just hanging of a pole) as each level is simply not tall enough to have an adult minifig stand upright. Add to this the fact that he cannot stand on the bottom level as that is all tile as part of the one play feature&nbsp;on this bus. The stickers do definitely&nbsp;add to the looks of the bus. Overall, the dimensions and such do look correct. I like the chandelier, as well as the designer having chosen to make the top level removable, a side-wall of the bus being able to be opened, and the inclusion of the sliding bed.</p>

<p>Without the minfigures it one would not see that the bus might be a tad too small. In general, this is by far the best looking Knight Bus produced yet. The designer has done a great job in capturing the shape of the bus and using the (new) bricks available to him/her.</p>

<h2>Play vs display</h2>

<p>Although the bus would definitely not be out of place as a display set, I think this is above all a play set. I can see many a child racing the Knight Bus across any place where it can and cannot go, much like the real vehicle. Getting the minifigures in might prove a bit tricky, but is doable. A true display model of the Knight Bus ought to have been slightly bigger (scaled up).</p>

<h2>The verdict</h2>

<p>Overall, IMHO&nbsp;this is generally a good set. The price per part is OK, the minifigures are nice (with two minifigures unique to this set), and the bus as a whole simply looks good. Yet somehow, this does not feel like a 40 euro set. The bus - in the end - is quite small.&nbsp;To quote Jang: it does not look like a 40 euro set. The set is arguably one&nbsp;minifigure&nbsp;(or a wolf) short as well. The 40 euro price tag is justifiable, but if you can find it for 5 euros cheaper, this definitely becomes a set to go for.</p>

"Croatoan87","2019-12-13T12:09:05.38Z","It's the Knight bus, how can one resist","<p>I&#39;ve been an avid Harry Potter fan for as long as it has been out, having been the same age as Harry when the books came out. Thus I was an equally enthusiastic to find out that there are Lego Harry Potter sets when I became an&nbsp;AFOL.</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></p>

<p>The set comes in a good sized box, a bit bigger than necessary in my opinion for the number of parts in the set but also extremely convenient when I travel around with it as the completed build fits perfectly into the box when it is complete. The instruction booklet is small and compact.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The parts are very monochrome, but that is expected considering the subject matter. The dual sided headpiece used for Dre Head, which is a new piece was pretty awesome. A whole collection of parts were new, like the Dark Purple Window, The Transparent slope and the dark red panel.</p>

<p><strong>Building the Set</strong></p>

<p>Building the set itselt was also quite a ride, building the chassis of the bus was an interesting technique that I enjoyed. It does on occasion feel a little repetitive when building the outside of the bus but there is a good balance between building the outside and the internal accessories so it never gets boring.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The Harry Potter minifig was interesting, and the new Torso and Face was also a nice change from the previous sets. Ernie was also made up of mostly new parts, the little bald skullcap was a fun addition and then there is the facial expression, absolute hilarity. But of all the minifigs, Stan is my favourite, mostly because he is in a completely purple outfit (Also made up of new parts) which I just find so ridiculous that I cannot help but love it.</p>

<p><strong>The Final model</strong></p>

<p>The completed set feels very stable, with limited risk of in coming apart, which in turn increases the playability offered by the entire side panel of the bus that opens up to reveal the inside.</p>

<p><strong>Overall opinion</strong></p>

<p>Finally, I really feel that this is a good model, the little scenes inside the bus brought back a lot of memories from the books and the film. Whether as part of a collection or a stand alone piece this set is well worth spending money on.</p>

"Randomness","2023-02-01T01:09:04.95Z","Take it away, Ern!","<p>I can&#39;t deny it, I&#39;ve always wanted a Lego Knight Bus ever since I saw the 2011 one up for sale, and when this came out, I had to get it. Anyhow, here we go.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>Of course, you have Harry Potter.&nbsp;The exact same minifigure comes in #75945 and #75947, which I already had beforehand, so this wasn&#39;t the greatest acquisition.</p>

<p>You have Stan Shunpike, who comes with a very nice hat, I think. Purple pants are also a great acquisition, although you could really just buy a Minecraft set to get one.</p>

<p>Ernie, while never really getting any spotlight, and only having lines in the book, has a really great minifigure. Hadn&#39;t had a balding piece before, so that was good.</p>

<p>Shrunken head is very fun.&nbsp;I mean, it did have the best lines of the movie film. If you put it on a regular minifigure, it of course looks real awkward, but that is expected.</p>

<p>Just really quality&nbsp;minifigs.</p>

<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

<p>It was pretty, good although the great expanse of purple pieces was sometimes hard to sift through. The sheer amount of windows and pushing them in was also a *bit* repetitive, but besides that, good building.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s sort of a purple parts pack. It&#39;s price per piece is basically exactly 10 pieces per dollar, which makes it not a bad deal, but also not a great one. A good part of those is windows (just so many windows), so it&#39;s parts-pack-ness is limited in that regard. But, where else are you going to get so many purple pieces?</p>

<p><em><strong>End</strong></em></p>

<p>So is it a good set? Well of course it is! Sure, the ppp may not be so great, one of the&nbsp;three minifigures may be in two other sets, and it&#39;s rolling is very limited on carpets, but it&#39;s still good. Just replace all your floors with tile or hardwood.</p>

<p>Oh,&nbsp;the stickers also exist. There&#39;s only five of them, so it&#39;s not very bad.</p>

"RichieBitchy","2021-01-11T18:29:59.23Z","The Best Knight Bus Iteration to Date","<p>The famed Knight Bus set was initially released after the 2004 film&nbsp;<em>Prisoner of Azkaban&nbsp;</em>hit theatres. This was obviously a very distinct set then, as purple parts were a lot rarer then, than now. Despite the set&#39;s clunky design, it was prized among collectors for its purple pieces that discoloured after time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After another nondescript release in 2012, Lego has got it right with this latest release. This is definitely the sleekest and most well-made Knight Bus set to date. The shape, details, and angles are all correct to the bus in the movie.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bus&#39;s back panel opens on hinge pieces to reveal the sliding bed, dangling chandelier, and a chair for a traveller. The bed, chandelier, and the shrunken head in the front by Ernie Prang all sway and slide around when the bus is tilted. The top deck of the bus can be accessed by removing the roof. There are small studs to which one can attach Harry&#39;s luggage.</p>

<p>All around great set, easy but fun build, valuable purple parts, and a must-have for any Harry Potter fanatic, as this is one of the most distinct and intrinsic features of the franchise. Priced at 40 USD, it&#39;s a fair deal.</p>
