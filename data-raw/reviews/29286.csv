<p>Comes in the special advent calendar box. The front of the box is thin and lifts up revealing the 24 &ldquo;gifts&rdquo; you get. Each little box lid shows the instructions of what you get and how to build it. I do wish they gave an instruction booklet so you don&#39;t have to rely on the box to build it every time. Really cool box though and a nice way to do a set like this.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>The piece haul is amazing in this set. You get so many great food pieces. You get a pie, a turkey, ice cream, cookies, chocolate bar and a croissant. You get a black witch hat and orange scarf for the snowman. You get a black and a white trophy fig as well. You get an entire gold minifigure. You get 11 printed pieces which are: Letter x2, cookie x2, chocolate bar, Harry&#39;s letter to Hogwarts, 4 2x2 tiles each one of the&nbsp;house&nbsp;crest (Gryffindor, Ravenclaw, Slytherin, and Hufflepuff), and a 1x2 tile in the book.

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build wasn&#39;t too hard to build. It took me around 20-30 minutes. You had a lot of small builds in this set. You had two tables with food, a fireplace with a wreath, you get 4 flag stands. Each one has two different color flags representing the different houses at Hogwarts. You green and silver for Slytherin, yellow and black for Hufflepuff, red and gold for Gryffindor, and silver and blue for Ravenclaw. You get a snowman, two identical small Christmas trees, one large Christmas tree, micro scale hogwarts express and chess set, A statue with a gold minifigure with a stand with the four crests of the houses on it,&nbsp;four gifts one 2x2 and the other three 2x3 each one in the colors of each house. You get a tan orange&nbsp;chess with an owl, book, and some other parts. Overall a nice haul of small builds and parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a nice set. You get six classic and iconic figures from the series. All of them have great detail and good facial expressions. I love getting Ron and Harry with their Christmas sweaters from the Sorcerer&#39;s&nbsp;Stone. All the small builds you get go together well. I like how they do a good job of three different times representing all four of the different houses of Hogwarts. The parts you get are great. You get a lot of good food parts from the pie to the turkey. I recommend getting this set (especially if you are a Harry Potter fan) This is a good advent calendar. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>
