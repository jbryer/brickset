"Ovid07","2007-07-11T12:56:04.12Z","Nice Set","This is one of those small sets that is &quot;nice&quot;.  I got this at brickworld and didn't really think much of it.  But still, gives you Thunder a little Dino and lots of accessories.  The cart is also nice with a good design to place the crate on.  However don't go looking for this set because with it not be made any more, it's not worth it. Especially with those new Indiana Jones sets coming soon.   ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-14T01:02:51.497Z","Cloverfield","This set attempts to do the &quot;big box of tools&quot; bit, but it has modified the concept to include a hand pushed/pulled cart for the box, and a one-piece baby dinosaur - the almost useless piece for dino island.  The building isn't complicated, but the end result is blend and doesn't colour-coordinate properly - the blue wheel clashes with the rest of the cart.  Play wise, it isn't really much on its own  - the baby dinosaur can be placed in the box and carted here and there, and it could be hunted by the minifig with the box of tools.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-05T11:03:17.78Z","Johnny thunder in the dino island","This is a small set, smaller than the island racer, of the same subtheme, and have few pieces. Here are included again the figure of Johnny Thunder, main character of the theme, and easy to find when released with the theme, but this was replaced by Indiana Jones and his theme. The set consists in the minifigure carrying a little cart with itens and a don't playable baby tyranossaur. Itens are additions to this, like the binocular, shotgun, pickaxe and the hat of the minifigure. A piece in the upper part of the set can be putted in many vehicles(carts, rafts, and also cars...) to carry itens like the included in this. The colors of the pieces are well painted, like the green of the baby T-rex. The wheels of the cart are small and blue, some of these were released with old space and castle. It don't have many playability due to have few pieces and be small, but still useful to be an addition for other sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-25T09:45:06.71Z","LEGO Adventurers (Dino Island) - Johnny Thunder and Baby T Review","For an impulse set I think it's okay. This set doesn't have any play features but we get some useful accessories like a rifle, a telescope, a pair of binoculars and a picaxe. This set which includes a small wagon also includes a baby dinosaur and we also get another Johnny Thunder minifig. I know that we all like this character but I think he's in too many sets. The pieces can be useful if you want to build some MOC's and/or if you want to make a brickfilm. It's an okay set to have but I think you should get the bigger sets first before you get this one.<br><br>All
in all this set is an okay set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"BobaFett2","2011-01-11T13:43:19.137Z","Hmm...","<p>I got this set with a bunch of other ones from a friend's collection. It's certainly an odd little set, with Johnny Thunder pulling around a box of tools.
</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>It's a nice presentation, good background, good scenery. Doesn't add too much though.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The set has great parts for only 2 dollars. You get a Baby T-Rex, a box, blue wheels, a gun, black binoculars (a bit rare), an astrolabe, a pickaxe, and a few other parts.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Johnny Thunder is great. A bit overdone though.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's simple-just placing things on top of each other. It's small, so not much to expect.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>It looks good, but it could have been done better.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, this is a good set. However, it is a bit lacking when it comes to it. It's small-the price is great-but it could have been a little better. I would recommend this set if you have a few dollar spare, no more than 4 dollars unless you are collecting the theme.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,4
"Lochdent","2019-01-17T12:56:42.31Z","Tiny dino adventures!","<p>This set comes from a time when Lego did tiny $2 boxed sets, I got this&nbsp;with my pocket money and it became an instant classic!</p>

<p><strong>The Box</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t keep the packaging and it was a long time ago but it was a tiny almost cube box with a punch hole. I miss these tiny boxes and I think Lego should bring them back as I&#39;m sure they would be more environmentally friendly, they looked cute and they made little kids with not so much money feel like they were getting a real Lego set!</p>

<p><strong>The Instructions &amp; Build</strong></p>

<p>The instructions, typical of this type of tiny set are a single sheet, there are no errors but they do feature the much missed alternate build inspirations even with so few pieces. The build is very straight forward and even when I was 7 took no more than a few minutes.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures &amp; Parts</strong></p>

<p>There is one figure included in this set and it&#39;s the hero himself; Johnny Thunder! He is wearing his standard outfit here, carried over from the previous theme but looks no less splendid for it! Also included is a baby T-rex, pretty lame by today&#39;s standards but very exciting and new at the time. He&#39;s pretty cute and fairly well sculpted. This is a great&nbsp;little accessories pack featuring a rifle, pick axe and&nbsp;sextant. Perhaps most interestingly from a parts perspective is the inclusion of a pair of binoculars in black and 2 wheel rims in blue!</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This set isn&#39;t going to set the world on fire and it&#39;s probably not even worth getting if you don&#39;t already have it, but if you do, you already know how great it is!</p>
