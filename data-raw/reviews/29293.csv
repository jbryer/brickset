The minifigs, from best to worst, are as follows: Dustin, Joyce, the Demogorgon, Lucas, Chief Hopper, Will, Mike, and finally, Eleven. The Dustin minifig&nbsp;does a near-perfect recreation of the actor with the face and the hair/hat combo. The torso is also very detailed. The Joyce minifig also portrays the actor very well, however the legs need printing. The Demogorgon minifig works well with the special leg pieces and the long claws. The part I dislike, however, is the specially molded&nbsp;face piece. It doesn&#39;t quite capture the horror of the Demogorgon. Unfortunately, there isn&#39;t really anything LEGO could do to fix this. The Lucas minifig matches the actor pretty well. I like the use of the bandanna piece but dual-molded to show his hair. The Chief Hopper minifig doesn&#39;t portray the actor well because the facial expression seems to be a dead-eyed stare. The legs on Hopper also need printing even more than on the Joyce minifig. The Will Byers minifig just doesn&#39;t have the face right for the actor. They tried to get it with the new hair mold, but just didn&#39;t. Mike looks even less like the actor, mostly because of the hair piece. The Eleven minifigure looks good except for two things. The minor issue is the hair piece, which I don&#39;t think looks very good. The major issue is the cloth skirt, which makes Eleven look like she is wearing a pink bath towel.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build:</strong> The build for the houses is very good in both cases. I had a lot of fun building this set, mostly because of unique techniques in places like Hopper&#39;s car and the Upside Down House. The whole build looks very nice and/or creepy. It is aesthetically pleasing.</p>

<p><strong>Playability:&nbsp;</strong>This set is NOT MEANT&nbsp;to be played with. However, there is ample, and I mean ample, room for minifigs anywhere in this set. The light brick feature is nice. This set is a bit unstable when set on carpet.</p>

<p><strong>Displayability:</strong>&nbsp;This set is MEANT to be displayed. It works as a centerpiece in any LEGO collection, although it does need a nice and wide shelf to sit well upon. The set has a stand for four minifigs of your choice. It looks good displayed in any direction.</p>

<p><strong>Price:&nbsp;</strong>As a 15-year old, I forked over $220 (with tax) for this set. That should say enough about how much I value it.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
