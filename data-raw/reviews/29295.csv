"lkb57","2019-07-22T01:48:58.74Z","Zero-G Satellite Repair","<p>The 2019 Space sub-theme looks fantastic, and I&#39;ve been excited to start collecting them. This polybag was a great start. First, the front of the packaging for the entire sub-theme includes a small photo describing the actual NASA vehicles/missions that inspired the particular set, and I was excited to see that this polybag is no exception--even, if the inspiration is some-what generic &quot;NASA spacewalks&quot;. I think this small nod to actual NASA science and missions is really fun, and a great way to get both young and old fans of LEGO interested in current space exploration efforts.</p>

<p>The satellite is a fun build that incorporates some simple SNOT techniques to construct the small control panel. I was excited to see that both the 1x1 keypad tile and the 1x4 solar panel tiles were printed . . . they should make great pieces to incorporate into other city or (in my case) Jurassic Park sets.</p>

<p>I have only one complaint about the set . . . and this is really a shortcoming of the entire sub-theme, and not just this one set. While the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6263432/space-visor-no-1002"">visor part</a> is fantastic, the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4600121"">helmet </a>part leaves a lot to be desired. The part was first released for the 2011 space subtheme. Sadly, it bears almost no resemblance to either <a href=""https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4e/bb/95/4ebb9542148dc24799fea098987db6de.jpg"">modern NASA space suits</a>, or to the older (and probably more famous) <a href=""https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e3/Aldrin_Apollo_11_cropped.jpg"">Apollo lunar space suits</a>. It seems to me that the release of the new 2019 space sets would have been the perfect opportunity to introduce a new, more accurate helmet part . . . especially since this year marks the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing.</p>

<p>Ok . . . rant over. Besides that one flaw, this is a great little set and a fantastic source for space-themed parts. I definitely recommend picking one up if you spot it in stores.</p>

"Japanbuilder","2019-10-15T01:47:23.187Z","Nice little addition to a space line up. ","<p>2019 marks a very fun year in the LEGO City line with a proper Space theme. I have always been a fan of LEGO Space and having missed out on the most recent wave which debuted I believe through 2014/2015 I was very excited to see what LEGO would do to follow up those sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interestingly they followed this up with sets inspired by recent NASA projects such as the Lunar Gateway program and the NASA SLS Program. While not accurate at all to any of these real-life projects the homage is undeniable and very welcome.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Today we will look at one of the smallest, if not the smallest, set in the wave for 2019. It is the polybag set 30365: Space Satellite. How does it look?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Packaging:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Standard fare, but it does feature a cool picture of a real astronaut on the corner. It sure gets the imaginative juices flowing and it is great to have it on the front.</p>

<p><b>The Build.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build experience is simplistic to say the least but the parts included are sure welcome and useful. We get a large dish piece and a telescope piece in pearl gold. We get the modern figure print for the 2019 astronauts which look nice and are highly detailed. We also get 4 1x2 printed tile pieces of solar panel arrays, these will be handy to be sure for many a MOC based on contemporary Space sets. Plus we get 2 printed 1x2 tile pieces of the digital key pad. Very nice!</p>

<p><b>The Minifigure/s:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figure included is the &quot;main&quot; character of the wave I suppose as he is in virtually every set this wave. Since he is covered in his EVA suit it hardly matters but for folks with a modest collection who happen to get many of the Space sets for 2019 this face may grow tiring. Still the detailing is very nice and comes complete with leg and back print despite the fact that the torso printing will be lost in his equipment.</p>

<p><b>The Completed Build:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We get a decently sized satellite here. While I am sure it wont be to everyone&#39;s liking the general shaping and detailing works great for imaginative play. The astronaut coming armed with a wrench and camera/light fixture on his suit will also make this particular figure really stand out among the others. The satellite is also highly swooshable and the folding solar panel arrays lend to plenty of play pretending they are broken or in need of maintenance. The swiveling pearl gold piece above the keypad is also a nice touch as you can use this to place your astronaut on the satellite or you can use that as a docking port to other sets in the line.</p>

<p><b>Overall:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a nice little set to get. If only get a handful of sets in this series for the year this one surely is a good one to have. You get a massable astronaut figure as well as a very well detailed and necessary satellite unit that you can use to add to your space world or expanding space operation. Generally for the price point these little impulse grabs are a treat from LEGO and you can&#39;t go wrong if you have a little LEGO fan in your family or a Space exploration nut you know would love something like this.</p>

"vikings","2019-12-30T04:27:09.897Z","Nice Satellite","<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a polybag and has the normal instructions that come with polybags. Instructions are clear and easy to follow.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You get some nice parts in this for a polybag. The 1x4&nbsp;printed tile for the satellite panels along with&nbsp;the 1x1&nbsp;printed key pad tile are nice pieces to get. You also get a silver wrench for the astronaut.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong></p>

<p>You only get one astronaut in this set. Single sided head. Helmet comes equipped with a light on the side of it which is nice. Is also given a silver wrench to use for repairs&nbsp;Minimal printing of the space suit on the body and legs. Overall a decent figure for a polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me a couple minutes to build. The total piece count is 36.</p>

<p><strong>Complete Model:</strong></p>

<p>After finishing the model I was impressed with the quality of the satellite for it being in a polybag. The detail you get from in a polybag is really good. Being able to adjust the panels on the side of it is a nice feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great satellite given it is a polybag. The detail and parts are really good for such a small set. The astronaut is okay. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5 star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"VerMonster","2019-11-26T22:32:06.307Z","Excellent polybag, just wish it was easier to get. ","<p>So, let me start off with the part I didn&#39;t like. I had to get it through Bricklink, it never showed up in my area at the retail level. Which is a &quot;boo-hiss&quot; for me. Still, I was able to get two at a price comparable to retail for a polybag, so I&#39;m just grumbling about paying for shipping and not being able to blame the over buying of these on a lack of impulse control.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Because a (non-Classic) Space christmas theme would be cool on a mini-tree or wreath.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifig is the same one used across this line. It doesn&#39;t reflect in detail any space suit I&#39;ve seen pictures of, either retired, in service or prototype. That being said, minifigs usually look like they have terminal jaundice so I&#39;ll let it pass. :P I think putting a drill in with this might have been more accurate than the wrench, but the wrench is probably a cheaper molding</p>

<p>The star of this polybag is the satellite. First up, the solar panels are printed. It&#39;s a good design, and solid enough to be swooshed. This could MOCed up to be a variety of satellites, and as it is it is very solidly playable. What did surprise me, and maybe shouldn&#39;t have, was how much nicer this design is to the one in 60224 Satellite Service Mission. I&#39;m not saying that one is bad, this one is just nicer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I REALLY want to give it a five. I really, really do. But if I can&#39;t find it locally, and have to pay shipping, it looses something. LEGO appeals to the part of my brain that is still around 12 and super impulsive, which is why polybags&nbsp;should be more of a thing in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>

"Slobrojoe","2020-02-14T16:28:59.83Z","Would be even cooler if the satellite floated!","<p>This set is 1 of 16 Space sets released in 2019. Lego had a sudden resurgence with&nbsp;a&nbsp;Creator Expert&nbsp;set, 2 poly bags&nbsp;and some really great&nbsp;boxed sets. This is one of the poly bags.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions:</h3>

<p>This set comes in a poly bag. It has an instructions leaflet with 12 steps in total and the minifig. The only mistake is that in one step, the studs were shown as light grey and the next dark grey, when they are actually silver, but, since there are only studs in one colour, it&#39;s not as much as a big deal as other larger sets.</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>There are some really interesting and rare pieces in this set, making it a could set for parts for MOCs. To start off, it has a pearl grey&nbsp;spanner and&nbsp;a large radar dish. There is a gold telescope piece and a printed 1x1&nbsp;flat tile of a keypad. It includes 4 printed solar panel&nbsp;tiles an orange, circular 2x2&nbsp;plate with a technic hole in the middle. Those are all the best parts, in my opinion, apart from the minifig.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures:</h3>

<p>There is only one minifig in this set. The astronaut is smiling and has a printed torso with curved orange stripes. There is also a small logo and some grey markings but are covered by the helmet. The helmet has a breathing system and a torch that clips onto the side. The only bad thing about the torch is&nbsp;that you can see the blue half technic pin at the back. The legs have the same curved orange stripes. He has a pearl grey spanner.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Build:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The build is very short and easy, taking about 3 minutes. There is nothing unusual to note.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Completed model:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The solar panels can be adjusted and the radar dish is put to good use. There are 4 spare pieces: a blue half technic pin with a stud; a silver stud; a translucent blue flat stud; a 1x1&nbsp;flat printed tile (keypad).</p>

<p>Overall, for &pound;4, this set was a bargain with the rare pieces and the cool astronaut. The only downsides were that you could see that pin and there are torso markings covered up. It would be even better if there was a transparent stand to support it. I highly recommend it to anyone and is a must-buy.</p>
