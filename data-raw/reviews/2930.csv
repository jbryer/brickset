There're no stickers included in this helicopter and the built is very quick and easy. This impulse set has only one play feature. The feature of this set is that the blades can sviwel full 360Â°. This helicopter also comes with some useful tools like a gun, a shovel and a camera. We also get another Dr. Kilroy minifig in this set. I have to say that this set is a good set for an impulse set but I also think that you should try to get the bigger models first before you get this one. The pieces can be useful for future MOC's and/or brickfilms for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
