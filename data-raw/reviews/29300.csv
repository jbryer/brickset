<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The other day, I went to Barnes &amp; Noble in search of the Hidden Side sets. While they didn&#39;t have them just quite yet, I found this set on a Lego HP display table. It instantly caught my eye, as I had seen other people&#39;s look at this set when it was first revealed. (such as Just2Good).</p>

<h3>The Box</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The box is a standard $20 box, nothing too out of the ordinary. Although, the packaging&nbsp;certainly is quite eye-catching, mostly due to Harry and Lord Voldemort&#39;s wand duel. I noticed that the Fabuland cauldron was not included on the front art, which I think is a bit strange.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With this set comes 4 minifigures. (5 if you count the statue on Tom&#39;s grave) Of course you&#39;ve got a Harry Potter, wearing his Triwizard Challenge attire, and sporting TLNM&nbsp;Lloyd&#39;s hair in Black. Then there&#39;s a Voldemort, wearing his signature robes, a Peter Pettigrew, which is a HUGE improvement from the last two Peters, and a Death Eater, with the wizard&#39;s hat in pure black.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The set comes with the main build, plus two sub-builds, which are another grave, (HP fans will recognize the symbol of the Deathly Hallows!) and a brick-built version of the Triwizard Cup. Previously we have gotten a Triwizard Cup in the Harry Potter CMF with Cedric Diggory (R.I.P) which was really not all that movie accurate, as it just used&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-89802"">the trophy piece</a>&nbsp;which has been relatively common in the past decade. Building this set was surprisingly fun! It didn&#39;t really use any strange techniques, but it gives a short yet calm build. The gravestone area is interesting, as it has a statue of an angel? (please correct me) holding a scythe. It also has a reasonable amount of foliage behind it. A stickered 2x3 tile in front saying &quot;Tom Riddle&quot; is mounted upon two medium stone gray 1x1x2 headlight bricks. (yet again, correct me, I&#39;m only a TFOL.) Under the 2x3 tile is a modified 1x2 plate with side bars clipped into a 1x2 headlight brick, that you can mount Harry on. There is also a space for a cauldron to boil, and the set comes with a bone, a splash of blood, which Lego needs to explain, and what is presumably Wormtail&#39;s severed hand. On top of THAT, there&#39;s a powerless Voldemort incased in a bundle of black cloth. That piece has previously been used for babies, which is funny! The clip-on side sections are nothing too interesting, just more sand yellow and foliage, along with a small headstone with a dark gray frog on top. The set&#39;s main play feature, however, is what I&#39;m interested in.</p>

<h3>The Play Feature</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you don&#39;t already own the set, you may notice the center section looks a bit odd. That&#39;s where the main play feature comes in. Place Voldemort on the exposed area of the small spinning plate, and lift up the other flap of land in front of that. Shut the land-flap, and push down the gray modified plate, and Voldemort seemingly pops out of his grave! This play feature is very fun to toy around with, but You-Know-Who can sometimes fly out across your room if you push down with too much force. (Quickly, I noticed that there are more Spring Yellowish Green tooth plates under the big land flap!)</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In conclusion, The Rise of Voldemort is a small but fascinating set with great minifigures, a great build, and great play feature, that I&nbsp;would totally recommend to any Harry Potter Lego fan!</p>

"Renaissance_Ravensly","2019-08-06T03:27:34.567Z","The Lord of Darkness and Shadows Rises Once Again! Mwahahahahahaha!","<p>So, I went to Target a few days ago and my father was very kind and allowed me to get a Lego set. Naturally, the choice was hard due to a lot of sets being recently released and a lot of them were ones I wanted. However I went with this one because for some reason, to my current knowledge, Lego does not show these sets on their website despite being released, and also this set offers some exceptional value with 5 exclusive minifgures (if you count the statue as a minifigure) as well as a reasonable piece count and a pretty good volume of stuff for a $20 set (in the U.S.A. I&#39;m not very good with international prices,&nbsp;so it may differ where you live). Anyways, let&#39;s get on with a more detailed analysis of this set&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i>The Box and Instructions:&nbsp;</i></b>Now, this is probably the shortest part of the review since the box isn&#39;t all that special. The box displays the set in it&#39;s glory around a dark blue background and some smoke. The back of the box shows off all the features which I will cover later in this review.&nbsp; As for the instructions, they are pretty easy to follow for a lot of people (I always like to caution people to read instructions thoroughly and carefully because mistakes are always frustrating to fix). However, an interesting thing I&#39;ve been noticing is a lot of sets have been lacking advertisements for the other sets. I wonder if Lego is doing this to be more economically friendly or a new marketing campaign or some other reason.&nbsp; Whatever the reason, it&#39;s something a lot of us will have to become acclimated to during the next few years</p>

<p><strong><em>The minifigures:&nbsp;</em></strong>This set offers a lot of minifigures for a relatively cheap set, which I think provides some amazing value. First I&#39;ll cover the statue because it&#39;s most likely the dullest minifigure. Even without a lot of detail, the statue offers a lot of charm, using the newer dress component in dark gray, which I&#39;m getting further accustomed to, but it looks nice. They also use a plain dark gray torso, head and hood piece. The wings are created by using the transparent neck bracket piece, 2 black stamp pieces, 2 of the newer clip pieces in dark gray and 2 angel wing pieces in light gray. The staff or scythe is contructed using a dark gray staff and clip piece and Lloyd&#39;s Dao in a pearl silver color. Next there is a Death Eater, which I believe is the first time we&#39;re getting in Lego, but I may be wrong. They are constructed using the newer Wizard cap in black, the newer dress component in black, a torso that depicts some type of robe and a quite grotesque looking face. Next, it would be fitting to cover Lord Voldemort.&nbsp; Now, there are 2 versions of him in this set. The first version is the baby mold used for the Native American in a Minifigure series recolored to look like a young Voldemort. The second version is a fully grown Lord Voldemort and one could say it&#39;s a color swap of the Collectible Minifigure version. Next, we have Peter Pettigrew. He has a pretty common hair piece, but common does not mean bad at all. He is pretty well dressed, wearing a suit that seems appropriate for the location and time period of the Harry Potter franchises. He has a gray hand to symbolize he cut off one of his hands as a sacrifice to Voldemort (How morbid, Lego). He has 2 faces, both showing his animagus features as a mouse, one looking rather worried and the other looking pretty mad. Finally, we got Harry Potter. The mid-legs used for him are a truly amazing invention and I&#39;m sure purist customizers&nbsp;will love them. Also, the torso reflects the one at the end, where he has won the Triwizard Tournament. He has a custom hairpiece, different from the one used in the first 3 movies and 2 faces, one furstrated and one happy. Both have his signature glasses and lighting bolt scar.&nbsp; Overall, a pretty good selection of minifigures</p>

<p><strong><em>The build:&nbsp;</em></strong>The build was pretty easy for me to build, but it may take more or less time depending on how much experience you have and your build speed. I always recommend building slowly so you don&#39;t miss anything. Also, there are a few stickers which take a lot of effort to apply<br />
<br />
<strong><em>The Completed Model:&nbsp;&nbsp;</em></strong>The completed model is very fabulous, using various shades of&nbsp;green parts to resemble grass and dark tan parts as well as brown parts as dirt. Various plants are used to make the graveyard look very overgrown and a combination of light gray and dark gray parts are used for the tombstones. There is also a cauldron for the ritual to revive Voldemort and a Triwizard trophy, which is very different from the one in the CMF series. I&#39;m neutral on the issue but I can see why many people are skeptical why Lego didn&#39;t use the one they created for the CMF series. Speaking of resurrecting Voldemort, the key action feature of the set is putting Voldemort on the 2x2 brown tile, pull the gray lever up, which puts Voldemort below the ground of the set and when you flick the lever, Lord Voldemort will rise from his grave. Even though this set lacks play features, the one they do include is pretty cool<br />
<br />
<strong><em>Overall Thoughts:&nbsp;</em></strong>&nbsp;Once again, I&#39;m impressed with another set. This set is fairly cheap, but contains 5 minifigures, a substantial build with a piece count befitting the price of $20. Even though this set lacks play featuresm, this does make a lovely display piece and the feature they do provide is thoroughly entertaining. All in all, I&#39;d definitely recommend this set to fans of Harry Potter as well as those who are curious, those who love minifigures and those who want a fairly cheap set with pretty good value.&nbsp;<br />
I&#39;ll see you guys soon<br />

My oldest son turned 7 that year and started reading the books in 2nd Grade. The books, movies, and Lego sets have been a staple of entertainment for our family since then.&nbsp; The Rise of Voldemort set includes some a nice play feature and all of the minifigures are excellent.</div>

You can also have a duel with Voldemort and his Death Eaters. [If you&#39;re not playing as the Harry Potter character you should rethink your core values. ;-) ]&nbsp; There&#39;s a nice trapdoor that lets you recreate Voldemort coming up out of The Cauldron.</div>

<div style=""font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"">&nbsp;</div>

<div style=""font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;""><strong>The reason you got this set, the mini figures:</strong></div>

<div style=""font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"">Harry&#39;s minifigure looks really sharp in his two-toned Tri-Wizard Tournament uniform which includes his name on the back like a sports jersey. He comes with a wand and longer hair so he looks as you would expect from the 4th movie. Harry&#39;s head has printing on both sides - one side is a confident smirk and the other side is a distressed frown on his face. Voldemort&#39;s figure is quite nice given that his robe was all black in the movie. The Torso includes lines to discern his robes wrapping around him. His head and face look appropriately evil for Voldemort. Voldemort&#39;s wand is white and the set comes with two white wands. This version of the Peter Pettigrew minifigure looks more sniveling than previous versions. Is face looks especially rat-like and includes two printed faces as well. His hair is long and really unkempt and he includes a gray hand to represent the fake prosthetic Voldemort gave him for his sacrificial hand.&nbsp; (This is a kid&#39;s toy? JK)</div>

<div style=""font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"">&nbsp;</div>

<div style=""font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"">The fourth minifigure featured in the set is one of the Death Eaters. The head only has printing on one side with a Death Eater mask and there&#39;s no face on the other side so you don&#39;t know specifically which Death Eater it is, but let&#39;s be serious - we all know it&#39;s Malfoy. A bonus minifigure included in the set is the skeletal statue that stands above Tom Riddle&#39;s gravestone. The statue is a regular minifigure and can come off the grave marker. There are no printed details on the Statue but the wings look quite nice. Brickset lists 6 minifigures and while technically in the box, I wouldn&#39;t call it a minifigure but it is the infant baby form of Voldemort. With the white face and slit nose features, It looks like you want to put it back in the cauldron and drown it.</div>

<div style=""font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"">&nbsp;</div>

<div style=""font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"">Also included in this set are some extra accessories for the mini figures. For instance there are a couple of bones, a set of two knives for Pettigrew, a gray frog, the cauldron pot, and a long sword for the statue. Also included are a number of greenery pieces to let you give your graveyard an overgrown, rundown look. The headstone for Tom Riddle&#39;s grave and the headstone with the Deathly Hallows mark are unfortunately stickers - we all know printed tiles would have been the best. There is also a Tri-Wizard Tournament cup built of Lego pieces included in this set. The cup looks passable but I honestly don&#39;t know why they didn&#39;t use the actual Tri-Wizard cup from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71022-12/Cedric-Diggory"">Harry Potter Series 2 Collectible Minifigures Cedric Diggory</a> set. especially since this set and the HP Collectible Minifigures all came out of the same time.</div>

<div style=""font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"">&nbsp;</div>

<div style=""font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;""><strong>Final answer:</strong></div>

<div style=""font-family:Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;"">Overall, I&#39;m really happy with this set because of the minifigures.&nbsp; The $20 US price seemed a bit high to me in the beginning but the value of the minifigures alone is worth that.&nbsp; The building process for this is not hard but it has a useful design.&nbsp; I know it&#39;s getting harder to build new Harry Potter sets with playability without rehashing old designs but this set is really good and I&#39;m looking forward to more Wizarding World sets in the future.</div>

"8BrickMario","2020-06-29T22:34:14.27Z","A wonderfully resurrected scene.","<p>This is LEGO&#39;s second rendition of the Voldemort&#39;s-resurrection scene from&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</em>. It&#39;s also much smaller. However, the minifigures looked to be excellent and this set seemed to cut out all the fat and stick only to representing the film. Such a pivotal moment being given such a compact set also made it seem lke much better value, so I went in excitedly.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>The pieces in this set are good. You get some good tan, brown, grey, and dark green elements, with two grey ingots and half-circles as well as two bright green Mixel teeth, two grey minifigure wings, a cauldron, and a translucent light blue 1x1 brick.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p><strong>Harry Potter</strong>&nbsp;is depicted in his Triwizard uniform, and, for the first time, the&nbsp;<em>Goblet of Fire</em>&nbsp;sets reflect the longer hairstyles that several of the young men had in the film. He reuses Lloyd&#39;s hair from&nbsp;<em>The LEGO Ninjago Movie</em>&nbsp;quite effectively in black. His torso is very similar to the 2005 version, but with no skin showing at the neck and more fabric detail. The back of the torso shows his last name. He uses the mid-length legs again, but somehow, this bothers me less for the Year 4 figures than it does for the Year 3 ones. I guess the hair does enough to make him look his age that the height doesn&#39;t bother me. He comes with a wand so he can duel Voldemort.</p>

<p><strong>Petter Pettigrew</strong>, otherwise known as Wormtail, is the standout of the set. Pettigrew is Voldemort&#39;s servant and can turn into a rat. He has&nbsp;had two minifigures before, but is massively improved here. Wormtail&#39;s hair has never been accurately captured, but this attempt is better. His first minifigure prioritized the bald spot by printing a ring of hair on a naked minifigure head, while the second just gave him the classic male hairpiece. This version gives him Snape&#39;s shoulder-length shaggy hair in dark orange, which looks a lot better and adds to his ratty vibe. However, playing around with pieces, I discovered that the piece used for sequel-trilogy&nbsp;Luke Skywalker and the new Sirius Black may have been the best choice, since it matches the silhouette of Pettigrew&#39;s hair much better and frames his face more accurately. That piece isn&#39;t as messy as Pettigrew&#39;s hair,&nbsp;but it might have taken the figure up that extra notch. Neither piece has a bald spot, but if Sirius&#39; piece were used, I&#39;d have thought it perfect enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pettigrew&#39;s face is fantastic, depicting thick eyebrows, moles, and his ratlike front teeth. It resembles his actor Timothy Spall pretty well, and the two expressions (angry and anxiously sniveling) are both perfect. His torso and legs do an excellent job of depicting Pettigrew&#39;s old pinstriped suit, patterned shirt, and bulging belly and chest hair. His back is nicely printed to complete the jacket. He comes with a wand and a knife, the latter of which is used in the ritual. His right hand is light grey to represent the magical silver replacement Voldemort gives him as a reward for being loyal enough to sacrifice his flesh one for the ritual.</p>

<p><strong>Lord Voldemort</strong>&nbsp;is the central character of the scene, and he&#39;s pretty nice. His face is similar to the 2011 version, but the contours have changed, his sunken eyes are depicted with yellow shadows, and his face feels a bit more like Ralph Fiennes&#39;. His expression has a big grin, which suits the character&#39;s triumph and Fiennes&#39; often-goofy performance, but I prefer the serious, calm expression in the minifigure series.&nbsp;He has his nostrils back after his previous depiction in the&nbsp;<em>LEGO Dimensions</em>&nbsp;theme&nbsp;removed them. For the first time, this theme gives Voldemort dress slopes for his lower body, which better captures his robes. His torso is nicely printed with the loose wrap of his robes, though the chest color is too faint and does not match the white plastic of his head and hands. The lower body is unprinted, but it doesn&#39;t feel lacking here. Voldemort comes with his wand as well, in white.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Voldemort is also represented pre-resurrection, where he is bundled up like a twisted, shriveled infant. The LEGO set rather hilariously uses the bundled baby piece in black with a peeved little Voldemort face in the opening. I love it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lastly, an anonymous&nbsp;<strong>Death Eater&nbsp;</strong>joins the scene after Voldemort&#39;s resurrection. This is probably my favorite Death Eater so far, depicting the&nbsp;<em>Goblet of Fire</em>&nbsp;costumes with their unsubtle pointed hoods and half-skull masks. The hood is cleverly represented by the conical wizard hat piece, and the prints on the head and body are very nice, showing a shadowed nondescript face under the skull mask and cloth and some detail of the robes. The design also feels simple enough to not demand dress printing, but I think the Death Eater could use it more than Voldemort. They also have a wand, in black, though they won&#39;t be using it as Harry and Voldemort are the only ones to fight.</p>

<p><strong>Anybody missing?</strong></p>

<p>Apologies for the ghoulish accidental pun, but yes.&nbsp;Task Three Cedric Diggory really ought to have been in this set rather than in the minifigure series with a shoddy Triwizard Cup. His omission seems obvious: they don&#39;t want to include a character in a set whose only role is to be a corpse...but yet they include blood and reference a severed hand in this set, so why is Cedric off-limits? If you missed out on the minifigure series, then this scene will always be a little incomplete, which feels unfair.</p>

<h2>The finished model</h2>

<p>The scene comprises the grave of Tom Riddle Sr. and some space around it for other graves and room to stage the rest of the scene. The center is meant for setting up the resurrection, while the left is where Harry comes in with the Triwizard Cup and the Death Eater can enter on the right. The scene is dominated by Riddle&#39;s grave, with a winged reaper statue on top. Harry can be placed on the piece below the statue and the scythe can be angled across him to mimic the way the statue restrained him to witness the ceremony in the film. Behind the statue, there are some leaves pinned in place by claws, and these can be used to hold two wands. Harry and Wormtail don&#39;t use them during the resurrection, but Voldemort cannot be hidden while carrying his wand, so it feels like there is one clip too few.</p>

<p>In front of the statue is the cauldron into which Wormtail assembles ingredients to revive Voldemort: a bone taken from his father (represented by a bone piece), blood taken from Harry against his will (represented by a Bionicle eye; a red translucent stud would have been better), and flesh given from the servant-Wormtail&#39;s hand (unconvincingly represented by a black robot claw).&nbsp; I can understand why they wouldn&#39;t use an actual minifigure hand, since they don&#39;t intend for hands to be removed and probably didn&#39;t want to make the severed hand too obvious, but it&#39;s disappointing. The ground in front of the cauldron hides Voldemort under a hinged panel. He is attached to a smaller hinge, activated by the grey rounded plate. Pushing down on it pushes Voldemort forward and out under the flap, which quickly drops down behind him. I especially like how well the lever matches the tombstones. It&#39;s nicely hidden.</p>

<p>The ground on either side of the center is sloped downward, which looks nice. The left side has a narrow tombstone topped by a frog, and the right has a grave with the symbol of the Deathly Hallows. This isn&#39;t in&nbsp;<em>Goblet of Fire</em>, but it&#39;s a nice touch. This grave has a leaf piece secured with a bow tile, but if you want a third wand clip, you can take a spare robot claw and attach the leaf with that. There&#39;s a third small grave formed from another curved plate, and the entire ground has sparse foliage and crumbled stone. The only odd part is the spring green Mixel teeth along the center section, which match nothing else in the set. I don&#39;t understand it.</p>

<p>The Triwizard Cup is included, and looks much better than the version Cedric came with. It&#39;s an effective microbuild that mimics the crystal center and barred pattern, though the four-pronged piece used for the outside meant the three handles couldn&#39;t be mimicked. It&#39;s an effective assembly.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This is a fantastic set that is very near to perfect. The minifigure selection is very good, with some noted improvements all around, the scenery is all it needs to be and very effective for the moment in the film, and the builds and pieces are interesting, and the central play function is nicely achieved. This is perhaps one of the best-value sets in the Wizarding World theme right now, and not one to miss.</p>

The Harry Potter, while a little plain, is a solid addition. The Peter Pettigrew&nbsp;looks very good and has a nice design for his clothing. The Death Eater, in my opinion, is the worst figure in the set. It just looks awkward with the pointy hat.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong>: The build looks very good for a dilapidated graveyard and maintains a good look despite the hidden play feature. The reaper statue is actually a minifig&nbsp;but looks so good in the build I chose to include it here. Nice overall.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong>: You can easily reenact the film scene until the twin cores, and the inclusion of a printed baby Voldemort is great. The play feature is well-integrated into the set and, while not accurate to the movie, serves a good role in the set. My only problem is that there is no possible way for Voldemort to hold his wand and remain completely hidden.</p>

<p><strong>Displayability</strong>: There is ample space for all the minifigs and the only loose pieces are either contained in the cauldron or can be placed on studs without looking awkward. The Death Eater doesn&#39;t really fit into the scene very well but can be tucked away off to the side.</p>

"BlobfishBricks","2020-03-02T02:44:06.403Z","Great set!","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I had liked the look of this set in the official images when it was announced in 2019, though I never realized what a great set it was until I bought and built it. It is a surprisingly large set to have no numbered bags, though the peace count is rather small. It was shocking to see how big the set turned out with so few bricks. To start off, the minifigs. Wow. Four exclusive (I think) minifigs in one twenty dollar set. That is great! I love Voldy and his followers and the Harry fig looks nice too, though a more scared face probably would have been more suitable. Unfortunately we did not get a Cedric with this set, though that probably would have made it too violent, given Cedric is killed in this scene. Speaking of violence, though... The whole set is made to capture the scene where Wormtail does all sorts of creepy stuff to bring back the Dark Lord, so it gets pretty grisly. Not only do we get the knife to chop off Peters hand and cut Harry, there is also clear red bricks and a bone, plus a clip peice, to resemble the &quot;Flesh, Blood, and Bone.&quot; In addition to this we get the great exclusive mini Voldomort wrapped in a cloth which looks great. Its made to be creepy, but he&#39;s honestly kind of cute, like that baby yoda were all waiting for. The set itself is great because its not enclosed in any way so the graveyard could stretch out miles, for all we care. The contraption to make the dark lord rise works good, and the statue to hold Harry looks nice, too. It cannot, however, hold him as it shows in the official images, but it can hold him in anther way.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I rarely give five stars to any set, but this one has a great amount of exclusive characters, and has great money value, especially compared to other sets announced recently, such as ones in the hidden side range. If you are a fan of Lego Harry Potter or like exclusive minifigs, you should definiately add this set to your collection.</p>

"Randomness","2023-02-01T17:31:10.81Z","It's less of a rise than a 90 degree turn upwards.","<p>I was hoping it would be more like the Graveyard Duel set, but this is fine too.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>We&#39;ll start with the titular character. Harry&#39;s in some very nice Triwizard garb, which does look nicely like the original, which I once found in a thrift store Lego bag. His hair does very well to capture the weird mullet he had during the movie film, and it&#39;s nice to get it in a different colour anyway.</p>

<p>Peter Pettigrew is very good, although the leg printing could leave something to be desired. The grey hand works perfectly, although at this point I still haven&#39;t been able to take it out of its socket, not that that&#39;s a problem, I just want to reenact the scene.</p>

<p>Voldemort is very good. The accents of dark green on black is very nice, although the white skin printed on the black torso is not super successful, as per usual. The nose slits have been done much better than they were onceupon a time, although it still makes you question whether minifigures do have nose things.</p>

<p>Finally, we have just a generic Death Eater. I mean seriously, how many Death Eaters have we gotten before that weren&#39;t just Lucius Malfoy with a reversible&nbsp;face? I do quite like the hat; I don&#39;t know when that came into being, but it&#39;s not bad.</p>

<p>The statue does gives some nice justblank grey pieces, and the scythe is nice, using that non-katana Ninjago sword. There&#39;s not really a use for that sword outside of Ninjago, but a new piece is always nice, I guess.</p>

<p>Baby Voldemort is a hoot, and with Baby Harry from the 2nd CMF series, I have complete collection of Harry Potter babies, I think. Not that that&#39;s what I was going for, but, uh...</p>

<p>The set could do with Cedric Diggory, although that could be too dark. You&#39;re lucky if you can get the CMF figure, but he&#39;s not really available elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

<p>As a $20 set, it&#39;s a fairly quick build, but the techneiques used weren&#39;t bad. Getting the sort of moundish curvature only take some clips and some slopes, but it works pretty well, and of course isn&#39;t a pain to build. I haven&#39;t met a $20 set that was, but it&#39;s still important to note.</p>

<p>There&#39;s really just 2 stickers, so that doesn&#39;t add any annoyances to the build, thankfully, and the Deathly Hallows gravestone is a very nice touch, so I think they&#39;re worth it.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&amp; Appearance</strong></p>

<p>I really like the grey frog for the gravestone; it&#39;s nice to get a non-brown frog from this theme. None of the pieces are too rare, but I&#39;m not certain it&#39;d be easy to buy all the pieces and rebuiild it from scratch. The cauldron could be a bit difficult to get your hands on, I assume.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a much better display piece than anything reallu, it doesn&#39;t look good from the back, though, butthat&#39;s not the worst thing. The Triwizard cup has been done many times before, and this one is pretty good. It&#39;s not bad at all.</p>

<p><strong>Playing</strong></p>

<p>Well, the function with &#39;raising&#39; Voldemort is very fun, although it doesn&#39;t work too well ifyou want him to come up with his wand in hand. Trapping Harry with the statue staff is very easy to do, and I&#39;m glad they built that in.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it&#39;s more of a display piece. It doesn&#39;t look very good from the back, with the black stick-grabber-things, and there aren&#39;t very many things to do withthe build exactly. It really depends on the minifigures.</p>

<p><strong><em>End</em></strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s a good set, and a very, very good display piece for a Harry Potter fan. It&#39;s not the be;st for playing, but it is only $20, so&nbsp;there are limits. Overall, it&#39;s very good, even with it&#39;s flaws, and I highly reccomend it.</p>

<p>If you can find it.</p>
