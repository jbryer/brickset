<p>The build itself is quick, as with any Brickheadz. That said,&nbsp;I also had a lot of fun building it, and arguably this is the most fun Brickheadz set to build. The colours are perhaps not the most striking, the pieces not the most special, but the techniques used are IMHO so much more enjoyable than found in most Brickheadz. Highlight to me was the construction of the arm and torch, with the added benefit of the spare lipstick piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a design, it is a nice abstraction of the actual Statue of Liberty: all features (the crown, hair, dress, torch have been &#39;Brickheatized&#39; as well as can be done, IMHO. To me, even if you do not like Brickheadz in general, this, IMHO, is one everyone should consider adding to one&#39;s collection.</p>

That being said let&rsquo;s save that discussion for the parts section of the review.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Welcome to New York City, heh, this box is a great looking one. The BrickHeadz is seen in a sea of blue with fluffy white clouds in the sky, almost as if you were at the physical location. The real statue is seen on the side of the package, which is pretty impressive. You may want to keep a sealed copy just for the box design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual was folded in half again making it frustrating to keep it open while building, but still the manuals are well designed. Meaning they don&rsquo;t have any difficult areas to follow along with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">This set is loaded with sand green parts, it&rsquo;s a goldmine as a parts pack if you&rsquo;re in need of sand green elements. You&rsquo;ll also find a nice gold hair element that is used for the torch, but could fit on any Minifigure head&hellip; I think it would look weird, but it is compatible. And the usual grey headlight bricks introduced in BrickHeadz is here.</span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A very enjoyable build for this BrickHeadz, the sand green elements and the overall design of the model gives you some interesting steps, the hair and crown Liberty is known for is extremely impressive. The toga she wears is also very interestingly integrated into the build. Overall a solid build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Lady Liberty looks awesome as a BrickHeadz. I don&rsquo;t know what else to say here, it&rsquo;s just a really solid model. Her Liberty Torch is really impressive. The only regret is that they did not print on the tile she holds with the iconic line associated with the statue. Another minor quibble, while everything is sand green, the clip used to attach the crown to the head is a grey 1x2 plate with clip. Which means you see a little grey clip sticking out when seen from the back. It isn&rsquo;t noticeable from the front though, so it isn&rsquo;t a huge part.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Lady Liberty is really a great set. It isn&rsquo;t the first time you build this statue with bricks, but it is the first time we&rsquo;ve seen it as a BrickHeadz model. It&rsquo;s a solid model and a solid build, not to mention a solid parts pack for all the sand green elements. Overall I&rsquo;d recommend getting this, it makes a great desk toy too. Strongly Recommended.</p>
