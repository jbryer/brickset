<p>Note-This review is spoiler free.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Packaging: It&#39;s a unique set, the pieces are in a single unnumbered bag with the instructions on the bottom inside a minifigure shaped container. The package notes the 3 minifigures and the drone. It&#39;s meant to be hung on a rack inside of on a shelf. It definitely stands out from the pack.</p>

<p>Minifigures: Well, the primary reason to buy&nbsp;any Marvel set is the minifigures, so this little one gives you three for your collection. The Spider-Man is wholly the same as the others in this series, except for an extra head. This spare head has Peter lifting the mask just enough to snag a bite to eat. It&#39;s a fun way to be able to use webhead in different scenarios than typical. It&#39;s a fun little piece. He comes with a printed web dish, which looks like when Spider-Man uses his web in an impact fashion.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maria Hill is the second figure,&nbsp;but honestly I see it&nbsp;more as Jessica Jones, once the&nbsp;hair is swapped out for a black ponytail. The pieces aren&#39;t unique, but in this configuration it is a new figure.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The real prize is Ned, the third figure. The legs are common, but the hair, head and torso are new. They capture Ned perfectly. He definitely helps to add some life to Far From Home scenes.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: There are three small builds in this set: a genstone&nbsp;in a case, a suit of armor, and a drone. The gem stone and suit of armor are common pieces used in a nice set up. I have a museum MOC, so they&#39;ll fit right in.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The drone is a variant of the others in the larger sets, again made from existing pieces. It&#39;s set on a clear dish and flag pole to simulate flying. The build has three rotor arms that are the exact same. It&#39;s a quick build so the repetition isn&#39;t a problem. The single trans orange eye gives the appearance of a camera or sensor. I like all three builds, they&#39;re a good example of the variety of things that LEGO can create with their library of pieces.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value for the money: Terrible. This set was 14.99 for 49 pieces. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability: High, the figures can be used in a variety of ways. The drone could be used with other figures in a park or beach MOC. As I said before, the armor and gem fit perfectly in my museum.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall: This is a great set, of it was half the price. I just can&#39;t recommend this at the current price point, despite the overall high grades.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-23T11:07:22.097Z","Far-From Home Accessory Pack.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #40343 Spider-Man and the Museum Break-In:</b> Far From Home was a great entry in the MCU with some excellent set pieces and some fun elements. It included three sets in the LEGO MCU collection plus this Minifigure pack which featured three characters from the film. Unfortunately it&rsquo;s a fairly difficult set to get because loads of people have wanted to pick it up. And I can see why.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">LEGO has altered the Blister Card packaging for these Minifigure packs, instead of the simple rectangular shaped bubbles they have created a new molded bubble in the shape of the iconic Minifigure. They have also made the package easier to open, with slits in the bottom of the cards that can be cut open to get access to the bags with the parts in them. The instructions are a simple fold-out manual which isn&rsquo;t too difficult to use, considering the builds included aren&rsquo;t elaborate.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Maria Hill: I almost didn&rsquo;t recognize her, her outfit is so different compared to the version which came in the SHIELD Helicarrier. Agent Hill&hellip; or Former Agent Hill&hellip; is dressed in a plain black jacket with grey undershirt on her torso. Her hair looks fine and her facial expressions work well, what she gets for an accessory in this set isn&rsquo;t a weapon, but a whole pizza. LEGO Pizza has a new print these days to better coincide with the individual half-slices, the print here is a whole pepperoni pizza.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Ned Leeds: Ned is Spidey&rsquo;s Guy in the Chair, and is wearing a grey undershirt which is matching with what Maria is wearing. He&rsquo;s also got a checkered over-shirt on, which is an interesting look. His hair is pretty rare too, I&rsquo;m not sure if it is new to his character, but it is definitely new for my collection. A dark brown semi-bowl cut colour. He isn&rsquo;t given any accessories.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Spider-Man: This is a really impressive print. Spidey here has printing on his torso, arms, legs (dual-moulded) and head, he also gets an extra head with half-unmasked showing him chewing on something&hellip; Probably a slice of pizza. He includes a clip with stud attached element with a printed dish on it showing him shooting a web out.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build &amp; completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is not much to discuss so I&rsquo;m going to combine it. What do you build in this set? Two museum display pieces, a suit of armour and a jewel under glass. And a hovering drone, yep, one of Mysterio&rsquo;s Drones is in this set, which kind of takes the lion&rsquo;s share of the parts. It also makes a fourth character in the set, technically speaking.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Nothing is too tricky to build, but the Drone is a repetitive build with the limbs. Everything looks great for the asking price.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A pretty good add-on to the Far From Home sets. The character choice is a bit useful, since we don&rsquo;t have Ned or Maria Hill from this movie yet. And technically&hellip; no wait, that&rsquo;s a spoiler. Ah well. The set is a very good value for money. You&rsquo;ll have a hard time getting it though, this thing has been in and out of stock so many times I was amazed I managed to get it when I did. Highly Recommended, if you can find it.</p>
