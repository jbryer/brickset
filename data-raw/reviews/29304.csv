<p>The parts and printing are high quality. The source material is well represented. Shazam&#39;s grin, in particular, seems suitable.</p>

<p>The figure is hardly exclusive, since it just swaps the white hood from&nbsp;<a href=""/sets/76120-1/Batwing-and-The-Riddler-Heist"">76120:&nbsp;Batwing and The Riddler Heist</a>&nbsp;for a relatively common wig.</p>

<p>For those who want to own it, you can also purchase the &quot;Shazam: Magic and Monsters&quot; Blu-Ray + DVD combo pack with polybag included for $18 from Amazon. I actually found it on sale for $10 a week ago, with free two-day Prime shipping. Since the polybag alone goes for $16 on BrickLink&nbsp;in the US, that&#39;s not a bad deal!</p>

<p>This particular version represents the character quite impressively. He features a very solid looking torso with unprinted red legs, a soft-goods white cape and a pair of vaguely familiar expressions. One side is smiling emulating Superman with a wide open grint while the other has electrical energy playing across his face and escaping from his eyes. Perhaps he&#39;s just transformed. His hair piece, I believe, is a re-use from the DCEU Superman Minifigures.</p>

<p>Overall Shazam is a nice offering and it&#39;s pretty great to have him with this particular version of his costume... not sure if original or New 52 actually. Strongly Recommended.</p>
