"legomac06","2019-08-13T05:45:00.083Z","A great set (just for Clutch Powers)","<p>This is a great set that features one of the most well-known LEGO minifigures of recent times - Clutch Powers! Whilst&nbsp;costing $18.99 (Aud) There is still good value in this set. Featuring four figures&nbsp;and a few extra parts.</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>+Clucth Powers</p>

<p>+Nice minifig selection</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>+useless side build</p>

<p>+unfitting kai minifigure for the season</p>

<p>Overall, a solid set, worth buying for the Clutch Powers minifigure alone.</p>

"StarKiller22515","2019-08-29T07:20:42.453Z","Good job LEGO","<p>This set has a great price point for what you get from it. It is so cool to finally get an official LEGO Clutch Powers minifigure. The dual molding on the Pyro Destroyer and the Ice Samuari is amazing and really shows how far LEGO has come. The Kai minifigure is pretty bland though and is just a throw in minifigure. Cool extra pieces and cool new unique pieces for the side build. Would definitly recommend getting at least one of these sets.</p>
