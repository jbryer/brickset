Its part of the 40000 range of sets, which were all produced for the Inside tour event, and given out to participants of these events. This set was released in 2019, and is owned by very few people.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The unboxing experience is unlike no other. The set comes in a pure white box, just like how ideas sets are boxed. It comes with a sleeve to go over this box, with the box printing on it to preserve the box, and allow for the box to stay in pristine condition. The front of the box is very basic, with the name of the set and the edition of the set on the bottom right, with a view of the set from the front. As for the back, its purely black with pictures of the building in real life, with a few text boxes of basic history for the building and the production of the product. The set even includes a group photo of the participants on the specific tour, hence there are different versions of the set available depending on what tour you went on.</p>

<p>Opening up the box, you get all the bags to build the set, with a massive baseplate for it to sit on. You also get the instructions, which have nothing special to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigures in the set aren&#39;t special either, using existing printing on the figures in unique combinations to make the different representatives of the countries. theres also a Lego Friends dog, which isn&#39;t exclusive either, but this isn&#39;t really a set for exclusive figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is truly magnificant. It looks really cool on a shelf, and has an interesting looking exterior, which will draw attention to it pretty well. The house is based on the real life System house, which is located down the road from the Lego House, and has incredible accuracy, for back in the day. The current system house has currently had the front door bricked across, so it doesn&#39;t look exactly like the set, but you can find images that show the older System house. The set includes some very nice Stickers, such as the door handles being 2 x 2 bricks sticker&nbsp;on a 1 x 1 tile (confusing, i know.) The flags are also stickered&nbsp;on each side, for the 10 different countries. Theres also a sticker on the modified 4 x 1 tile, with the old &quot;Lego&quot; logo as another sticker.</p>

<p>The interior is very detailed too, with 3 rooms built with equal attention to detail. The hallway has a display case, with some old lego models displayed, and doorways to each of the other rooms. The board room has a long conference table, with chair that go all the way around, and a built world map placed on the wall. As for the final room, its the most interesting. Theres a brick built moulding machine, Theres also the fabled 3D printed piece in this room, which has a buildable counterpart incase you don&#39;t want to use it. My only issue with the interior is that none of the furniture and interior pieces are stuck down, which leads them to slip and slide around.</p>

<p>Each other other sides for the exterior are pretty bland, with plain white walls on every other side, apart from the back which has a few window and some greenery. The roof is build so it can be lifted off, for easy interior access, and has some transparent dome pieces to make it a little more detailed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>overall, this set is an amazing building which looks great on display, and is definitely one of the cooler inside tour sets you can own.</p>
