<p>The Mars Exploration minifigure pack is neat little set and well worth your money.&nbsp; It not only comes with two exclusive ore pieces with a green interior but also an exclusive torso for one of the astronauts.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=ed0eaed99d&amp;attid=0.4&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1637519408436437534&amp;th=16b9a339dca9621e&amp;view=att&amp;disp=safe"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>The main and pretty much only build is a small desk with a variety of equipment on it.&nbsp; A small light (or microscope?) is set to examine the ore with the laptop presumably hooked up to the light.&nbsp; A small storage space is also given on one side which is a nice use of space.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=ed0eaed99d&amp;attid=0.3&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1637519408436437534&amp;th=16b9a339dca9621e&amp;view=att&amp;disp=safe"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>The solar panels use the riot shield piece in white along with two 1x4 printed tiles that only show up in this set and the satellite polybag.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=ed0eaed99d&amp;attid=0.1&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1637519408436437534&amp;th=16b9a339dca9621e&amp;view=att&amp;disp=safe"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>This &quot;build&quot; features a 2x4 plate and a piece of ore.... and that&#39;s it&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=ed0eaed99d&amp;attid=0.1&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1637519461771763773&amp;th=16b9a34647b1e03d&amp;view=att&amp;disp=safe"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>The real reason its there is for &quot;playability&quot;&nbsp;allowing you to &quot;mimic&quot; drilling the rock in half.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The Minifigures</h3>

<p>Here comes the only reason anyone buys this set. (and probably the only reason your reading this review) You get four minifigures with this set which is a plus since minifigure packs&nbsp;apparently only come with three now</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=ed0eaed99d&amp;attid=0.1&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1637519442732940756&amp;th=16b9a341d8e47dd4&amp;view=att&amp;disp=safe"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>This worker minifigure is probably the most generic and uninteresting of the bunch, but hey four Minifigures.&nbsp; He includes a wrench in silver. ( I know it kinda looks black it&#39;s just the lighting) His torso is used in a few other and the minifigure itself is in the&nbsp;60228-1: Deep Space Rocket and Launch Control and&nbsp;60229-1: Rocket Assembly &amp;Transport</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=ed0eaed99d&amp;attid=0.3&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1637519442732940756&amp;th=16b9a341d8e47dd4&amp;view=att&amp;disp=safe"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=ed0eaed99d&amp;attid=0.4&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1637519442732940756&amp;th=16b9a341d8e47dd4&amp;view=att&amp;disp=safe"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>The orange-suited astronaut is actually in another set too,&nbsp;60230-1: People Pack - Space Research and Development (Four. Minifigures.).&nbsp; Her accessory is a jackhammer.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=ed0eaed99d&amp;attid=0.2&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1637519461771763773&amp;th=16b9a34647b1e03d&amp;view=att&amp;disp=safe"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=ed0eaed99d&amp;attid=0.3&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1637519461771763773&amp;th=16b9a34647b1e03d&amp;view=att&amp;disp=safe"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>The torso of this scientist appears in a few new space sets as well but the cheapest one being $39.99.&nbsp; Her face print isn&#39;t the regular generic female face so that&#39;s a plus.&nbsp; Her accessory is a camera with a 1x1 circular tile attach to it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=ed0eaed99d&amp;attid=0.5&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1637519442732940756&amp;th=16b9a341d8e47dd4&amp;view=att&amp;disp=safe"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=ed0eaed99d&amp;attid=0.6&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1637519442732940756&amp;th=16b9a341d8e47dd4&amp;view=att&amp;disp=safe"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>Lego advertises this minifigure as &quot;exclusive&quot; but the only thing unique about him is his torso and not the design just the coloring.&nbsp; The torso design is found in&nbsp;60230-1: People Pack - Space Research and Development but in baby blue.&nbsp; The color of lime green was an odd choice considering the overall color scheme of this year&#39;s space sets. and gives off Buzz Lightyear vibes.&nbsp; His single accessory is a metal detector.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=ed0eaed99d&amp;attid=0.7&amp;permmsgid=msg-f:1637519442732940756&amp;th=16b9a341d8e47dd4&amp;view=att&amp;disp=safe"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>Was this review too long to explain a small little set? Probably.&nbsp; All told, being only $12.99 instead of the usual $14.99 in the US with 4 Minifigures and a neat side build PLUS&nbsp;two exclusive rock pieces AND a kinda-sorta exclusive torso... this set is worth your money especially compared to the beach minifigure pack.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"Japanbuilder","2019-10-16T00:35:15.17Z","Nice pieces, and that is about it. ","<p>Usually themes withing LEGO city get starter/booster packs of 4 minifigures to help consumers bolster the amount of figures they have for a particular theme. These sets are generally easy to get a hold of and are well priced as impulse buys. They also benefit from fun little builds that contain plenty of useful parts or accessories for the theme in question.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For 2019 this pattern seems to have been broken a little bit with the release of set 40545 for the Space Theme. I believe in most areas it is only available via LEGO itself which sadly limits who can get their on this set to raise the ranks of their astronaut and space support personnel.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s dive in and see if it is worth it to track down this set from LEGO.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Packaging:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Very unique. We get a fun blister pack here that is shaped like a minifigure in the main plastic casing. Opening it is also not too hard, it is held in place via protruding tabs on the back which are shut by tape so just slice the tape and pull the tabs down to get access to the interior.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Build:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is simple to put it mildly. Of note is the First Order Riot shield included in this set with no visor print and 2 1x2 printed tiles of solar arrays. From then on it is just studs on top of studs and your standard minifigure assembling techniques.</p>

<p>&nbsp;You are left with just one spare piece when you finish.</p>

<p><br />
<b>The Minifigures:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We get 4 figures and one of them is advertised as being an exclusive figure. Frankly though that figure is rather plain and not as interesting as the standard astronauts in the line for 2019. We get 1 orange environmental suit astronaut one ground crew and one scientist in the lot to round out the figure selection.</p>

<p>All of them are well printed and have fine details on their torsos and, where available, their legs as well. The exclusive figure as I said before is rather uninteresting as it has no leg printing and the suit design is not as striking as his regular orange suited companion. The best thing he has though is his orange visor which does at the very least make the figure important looking.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Side build and Accessories:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not much is going on here. We get a small research table for the scientist and some tools for the ground crew personnel. I imagine the intended play scenario here is for the ground crew to help the astronauts train on recovering rocks and ores and for the scientist to teach them how to analyze the samples they have gathered using the tools provided in the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I like the Geode pieces here and the use of the First Order shield is clever but overall the figures are the main draw. Thankfully we get a small storage safe to keep those Geode pieces from going all over the place during play. The scanning/lamp table element doesn&#39;t feel deeply scientific but a bit of imagination can easily turn it to a microscope. The laptop you can imagine is plugged into that and is helping in analyzing the rock samples.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Given it only comes from one source this set may be a hassle for many folk to get. I myself living overseas have no access to the online LEGO store. Thankfully I had scheduled a trip to LEGOLand Japan this year and was able to snatch one there but it cost me around 25USD for 44 pieces.The fact the piece count was on the pack meant that LEGOLand Japan itself had to import the item to its stores which is why the cost was so high.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you can get this for 10 to 12 USD in value I would say go for it, it will greatly bolster your ground crew and space crew for your space set up and it never hurts to get more Geode pieces. For regular play though the mainline sets should suffice in getting all the Space items you need. Sadly, this one is an easy pass if you feel you already have plenty of what this set offers.</p>

"charlesh555","2020-07-30T15:40:52.863Z","Good addition to the space theme","<p>The four mini figures in this pack (technician, photographer/scientist, 2 x astronauts) would complement any other space set in a collection, adding lots more playability for a small outlay.</p>

<p>The build is very simple, but who doesn&#39;t like assembling mini figures? The accessories for them are nothing new but the set does provide two of the relatively recently introduced rock/crystal pieces. There is also a lab desk with a microscope, laptop and a small movable solar panel. This is a printed piece (yay!) as there are no stickers at all in this set.<br />

I recently got this set for free thanks to a promo at the Lego website. Had it not been for the offer I would have given this set a miss, but for kids I think it is a worthwhile purchase thanks to the extra playability it brings to other sets.</p>
