"Novelty","2008-02-14T00:58:38.31Z","Snakes on a plain","This is another small set with the treasure hidden in some sort of structure.  However the structure looks weird, almost like a cross between an altar and a throne.  Random plants were added to give it an overgrown look and that works.  However, the &quot;hole&quot; where the snake emerges seems forced and unnatural from a design point of view.  Another unnatural and forced area is where the gem is mounted above the hole.  Parts-wise, this set is only good for the green bits, and even those are few.  There is also a gem and a gold piece included in the set.  There is some building in this set.  Colour-wise, the set is nice, but it could have less red to make it more &quot;hidden&quot;.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-25T09:12:59.7Z","Monkey Shrine","Pippin Reed's situation in this set is strangely similar to the one in the movie Indiana Jones and the Raiders of The Lost Ark in which Indy was trying to grab the small ornament on the altar in the first part. In this case, the small ornament is a golden plate with a face on it which looks like a monkey. The color combination is horrible and it doesn't look like you'll ever find something this colorful and eye-catching for a 'hidden' treasure. This set is however quite useful for parts as it contains a backpacks, a rifle, a treasure map (printed), a spider, a snake, various leaves and most importantly the golden plate with the monkey face.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-16T13:42:24.86Z","LEGO Adventurers (Jungle) - Hidden Treasure Review","Now this is a neat little impulse set which we get from the LEGO Adventurers theme. This set is a quick built and it comes with one minifig which is called Miss Gail Storm. She has a brown backpack which opens and she also has a white sun-helmet, red pants and a green vest. This set also includes a black spider, a rifle, a red snake and a golden sun-disk which is really shiny. It looks much better than the gold which we see in LEGO sets today. We also get a nice map piece. The small tomb does open and you can hide the sun-disk there. You also get a translucent lime green gem. It's a really good set for an impulse set but it doesn't have many play features.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
