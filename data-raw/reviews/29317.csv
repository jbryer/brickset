"TinyHippo","2019-06-13T12:21:47.84Z","Solid Microscale Effort","<p>The Star Wars Lego Magazine has an alternating cast of microscale vehicles and minifigures; the vehicles are sometimes re-releases of other polybags but other times completely new. More notably, the designers have clearly been given access to new parts to make some models and the At-M6 is no exception.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new parts enable good articulation of the legs for walking and posing, the head is even movable from side to side. The weapons are well placed and there are clever, SNOT techniques to make the rear section.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&pound;4 is a fair price for the set, even if you don&#39;t like the magazine, and even the parts alone might cost a similar amount of bricklink once you factor in postage.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>Craft looks acquired and fine. Legs has many points of articulation and is stabile enough to set him in some weird configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;Head&nbsp;unfortunately cannot move. Cannon at the top is great. Whole construction looks clean and well done. There&#39;s nothing to complain about. I like the way that they made a back of him. Little it disappointing that they didn&#39;t manage to make those bottles at his back, but still he looks ok.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>As I frequently say, parts are the main reason I&#39;ve bought those sets. This one is no exception. Parts are incredible useful, especially huge amount of plates with hinge bar. There are also: 3x1 jumper, small wings, 3x2 tile.</p>
