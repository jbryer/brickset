"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-27T12:38:02Z","Ruler of the Jungle","This is a nice little set, which has a very rare minifig, and blends in well with most other jungle-style sets. I attached mine to my 6278 (Indigo Island) for it to serve as a small shrine situated behind the large statue. This set also has the hard to find headmask of the Jungle Ruler. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-14T00:54:09.7Z","In the Jungle, the mighty jungle...","This is probably one of the most colourful sets ever, thanks to thebright reds and yellows and blue.  Despite being a small set, there's quite a bit of building involved, particularly with the idol/totem which is almost lifesize (minifig wise).  The design of the idol isn't great, but thanks to the colours involved, it looks interesting.  The addition of the minifig with the colourful plumed headpiece makes it stand out, and the other interesting design features on the minifig - the brightly coloured cape, the spear with the feathers, highlight the minifig so that it doesn't fade into obscurity besides the idol.  A spider completes the set.  This set isn't really good for parts, but is great thanks to all the accessories included.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-02T17:10:51.187Z","Ruler of the Jungle","This small set is one of the small from the adventurers theme, jungle subtheme. Like the other of the subtheme, this was released in the year of 1999. This small is another option to get a rare minifigure, the &quot;ruler of the jungle&quot;. This minifigure is cool, simple and nicely designed, with some good colors, a coloured cover and some other features. This set have also a little scenery, builted above a small green plate. The scenery have exactly the colors too used in other sets of this subtheme, making it better to increase. Also are included in this set, a spider and a black spear combined with some plumes on it. This set have a playability like the size, basic, but all the pieces are useful and it can increase so much sets. As a small set, this is in overall very nice and a cheap option years before, to increase more sets. 5/5   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-08-03T07:52:30.873Z","Colourful","This set is very colourful, the small altar looks like a toy robot I had when I was small. The ruler (King Kahuka) has a very interesting headgear. Also has a nice spear to prod other minifigs and feathers that can be snapped on to the spear. The cape that came with the guy is now already torn, and even so, the torn pieces are lost.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Terzeus","2010-11-30T15:22:42.983Z","Ruler Of The Jungle","This Adventurers Set from the Jungle theme looks poor in the first look. But only in the first look, because this set has a very nice minifigure with nice colour and printing. There are also very good parts, that you can use for creating a larger world of a Adventurers theme. But even with that is building of this set not interesting. But still, this set is a perfect addition into the Adventurers theme, which is very interesting at all.<br><br>Pros:<br><ul><li>Very nice minifigure</li><li>Great addition to the Adventurers collection</li><li>Some parts are really good addition too</li></ul><br>Cons:<br><br><ul><li>VERY Uninteresting building</li></ul>Verdict: A nice addition to the Adventurers theme with very good parts and colours. It is worth getting it, even if it doesn´t give you an interesting building experience.",TRUE,4,5,2,4,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-16T14:00:38.31Z","LEGO Adventurers (Jungle) - Ruler of the Jungle Review","Now this set is built very quickly. I think you might be interested in this set only because of the minifig if you can't buy the sets 5976 and 5986. The totem has no play features but this has some nice pieces which can be useful for MOC's and brickfilms. The minifig who's called Achu has a nice mohawk crown which has some cool markings on it. Also the printed legs and the markings on the torso are awsome. Achu comes with a red cape which has a LEGO minifig head on the back. I really like this cape. On his face you can also see two dark gray stripes. Achu also comes with a black spider and a black spear with a blue and a red plume. It's a good set if you want to get this minifig.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
