<p>Tina Tough has the honour of being the first female Minifigure to come with the Lego City Comic.&nbsp; It only took 15 issues, which covers the period 22nd March 2017 to 28th May 2019.&nbsp; She is also the pilot of the Gyrocopter (as per the title of the set), but Helicopter as noted on the cover of the comic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Following the last issue the price has reduced from &pound;4.99 to &pound;4.25.&nbsp; You only get one set of Lego with this comic, whereas the last edition had a extra one, so the value is Ok but I think &pound;3.99 would probably have been fairer due to only getting 29 pieces.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The wider foil packet is employed to hold the Minifigure and pieces, which is does well enough.&nbsp; My only dislike of the newer packets are that they tend to split when opening unless you are extra careful.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>As noted above, Tina Tough is the first female Minifigure to be supplied on the City Comic.&nbsp; Lego may have felt that the other comics and City sets&nbsp;covered this, but great to see.&nbsp; The Tina Minifigure also comes with <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60217-1/Fire-Plane"">60217: Fire Plane</a>, so this is an inexpensive way to get her.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>These sets can give you some nice pieces for little cost, however other than the Cool Yellow 1x2 plates, new to City sets for 2019 but around for a couple of years, that you get two of I wouldn&#39;t imagine people will be grabbing the comic for the parts.</p>

<p>The build is simple, but a little too blocky for my liking.&nbsp; It looks like something that a brand other than Lego would put in a small box and if all the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-City/subtheme-Fire/year-2019"">2019 Fire</a> sets were displayed together this probably wouldn&#39;t look right.</p>

<p>This is likely to be a set that quickly gets taken apart and ends up being used to build something else.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>I do like what they tried to do, but a Gyrocopter/Helicopter that puts fire out with a hand held fire extinguisher doesn&#39;t provide much playability - maybe a handheld stud shooter could have added some playability with possibly a simple small tree (like <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60001-1/Fire-Chief-Car"">60001</a> from 2013) and a flame element to knock down.</p>

<p>If you didn&#39;t get this the first time around then you probably haven&#39;t missed out.</p>

<p>If it was not for the first female Minifigure on the City Comic I would have scored this 1, but an extra point had to be awarded.&nbsp; On a similar note the parts gets two as you do have a slightly rare colour element with the Cool Yellow and the Playability is boosted as you can swoosh it with the&nbsp;rotor blades&nbsp;spinning nicely.</p>

<p>The next issue will contain a Diver Dude and an Underwater World!</p>
