<p>Pros - while the builds on this one are not at all difficult, it was very nice that I was able to build any of these vignettes with my 6-year-old daughter.&nbsp; Plus, the variety of things to build was fantastic!&nbsp; While we have plenty of helicopters already, I do like the color scheme of this one.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ski Patrol building/lodge is neat, with the first aid station and I like how they designed the roof.&nbsp; It&#39;s a fun build and gives different ideas on how to build a smaller building for play.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ski/Snowboard Sport shop is something new as well, as our growing LEGO city didn&#39;t have a feature like this before.&nbsp; I like how a sideways railing was used to store the snowboards!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no lack of snow gear available either, with skis, poles, snowboards and gear in abundance!</p>

<p>The snack shop is pretty standard, but fits in well with any winter theme</p>

<p>The half pipe and rail are new to us as well and pose a ton of play elements!&nbsp; Especially when you wipe out and need to be rescued by the medical team on their snowmobile.&nbsp; That&#39;s a great vehicle, with the stretcher on the trailer.&nbsp; Simple but effective.</p>

<p>And finally, the snowplow is fantastic.&nbsp; I always look forward to different service vehicles for our city and this is brilliant.&nbsp; I love the front plow with the guards on it and it can carry extra gear in the back.&nbsp; It might be my favorite item from this set.</p>

<p>Cons - Every set seems to have a helicopter, doesn&#39;t it?&nbsp; The ski/skiboard shop is very front heavy and tips over very easily unless you have it secured to a bigger baseplate.&nbsp; Same goes with the pipe run, it needs to be secured to something else.&nbsp; If you start playing with these items on just the floor, they are definitely going to fall over.&nbsp; Honestly, these are my only nit-picks with this set.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conclusion - I think this is a great set to acquire (especially at discount) if you want to add a variety of items and a slew of mini-figures to your winter layouts.&nbsp; While there aren&#39;t any rare parts/pieces to be had, there are tons of fun in store!</p>
