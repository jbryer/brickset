"Doctor_Sinister","2007-05-09T19:53:50.603Z","Dead cool.","The Biplane in this reminds me of the one in the film &quot;The English Patient&quot;.  It flies over my LEGO town now, buzzing the airship from 5956.  The sarcophagus got transported to the Tabletown museum where it occasionally opens up to scare the visitors.

As for the evil villain - he was elected Mayor of Tabletown some years ago and ever since then he's been in total control of everything - kind of cool to have such a villainous character in charge of the city, just don't go down to the docks at night, rumour has it he bred some sharks in the bay and his opponents tend to get fed to them...
