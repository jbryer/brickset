<p>Full disclosure: I love everything that appears on this patch, but will <em>try</em> to remain neutral.</p>

<p>This patch was produced to co&iuml;ncide with the release of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10266-1/NASA-Apollo-11-Lunar-Lander"">10266: NASA Apollo 11 Lunar Lander</a>&nbsp;and was sent along free with purchases of that set. Not mentioned at the time was that it was also free for seemingly&nbsp;<em>any</em> purchase over &pound;85; this fact was accidentally discovered when I made another purchase a few days later of some of the (bias warning!) beautiful <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-City/year-2019/subtheme-Space"">City&nbsp;Space</a> sets in order to obtain <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40335-1/Space-Rocket-Ride"">40335: Space Rocket Ride</a>.</p>

<p>From the long-winded explanation above, you may discern&nbsp;a predisposition towards all things Space-related. Again: I will strive for neutrality.</p>

<h3>The Lunar Module</h3>

<p>The title on the patch is &#39;APOLLO LUNAR LANDER&#39; and, indeed, featured front-and-centre is an Apollo Lunar Module (LM). Curiously, it isn&#39;t the LM in 10266 but instead the LM from&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21309-1/NASA-Apollo-Saturn-V"">21309: NASA Apollo Saturn V</a>. Now, that LM is a true triumph of microscale building, but if this a free gift with one set, why feature a picture of a different set...?</p>

<h3>The Lunar Surface</h3>

<p>A curved, grey, LEGO-studded surface: this is very nicely done. My heart would love to see <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/305-1/Two-Crater-Plates"">some craters</a> featured, but my head knows it would be tricky to pull off at this scale of stitching with the limited patch-space available.</p>

<p>... but I&#39;m willing to bet classic craters were&nbsp;included in some of the concept art for this patch!</p>

<h3>The Background</h3>

<p>Again from 21309, we see an orbiting Command Module (CSM); LEGO can have a pass this time at the inclusion of a component from another set, being as how 10266 doesn&#39;t include a CSM. Is that a hint to TLG to produce a minifig-scale CSM? Yes; yes it is.</p>

<p>And so to the elephant in the room: the Classic Space Logo. What on Earth (ha) is that doing there? Obviously, I adore this logo, and it gives me a warm, fuzzy, childhood-nostalgia&nbsp;feeling inside, but it doesn&#39;t seem to pertain&nbsp;to the subject matter here. On the&nbsp;other hand, the Classic Space Logo was clearly inspired by the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA_insignia"">NASA Seal</a>&nbsp;so perhaps its inclusion does indeed relate...</p>

<p>Either way, they&nbsp;get another pass, because, you know,&nbsp;spacelogo, Spacelogo, SPACELOGO!</p>

<h3>In Conclusion</h3>

<p>The inevitable outcome of this review is that I find this patch&nbsp;fantastic. Yes, it only tangentially relates to the actual set it was released to commemorate, but it is appropriate enough to display alongside it, especially if 21309 is nearby.</p>

<p>Taken as a standalone patch, everything featured on it is wonderful and adds up to a beautiful memento of LEGO&#39;s Space themes.&nbsp;</p>
