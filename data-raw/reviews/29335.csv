&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigure/scenery: Minifigure is really a sharp addition to this set unlike most Speed Champions sets. The head is very common, but the torso is unique. It&#39;s a leather jacket with a white t-shirt printed with the Porsche logo. Combined with the denim style plan in legs and included hair, this minifigure could be used in a variety of scenes. The option of the hair or&nbsp;helmet is a cheap and effective&nbsp;way to give multiple ways&nbsp;to use&nbsp;these figures. Hopefully LEGO continues this trend with Speed Champion drivers. The scenery is just three orange traffic cones, meh. Nothing new there.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: The first thing you notice about the set is the lack of a vehicle frame. Yup, this is a new way to build this model. Using a pair of plates, 2x2&nbsp;round bricks with a center hole for the axles, and perpendicular tiles to create the lines of the 911, I thoroughly enjoyed the new way to build a car. The brown accents in the cab are clever as well.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The big drawback is the excess amount of studs on the hood. Just throws off the look. The other issue I have is the spoiler, it&#39;s not attached in a sturdy way and it just looks off from the actual vehicle. I&#39;ll have to see if there&#39;s a way to improve it.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think this is a fantastic set. The change up in the building was a nice surprise and the figure has a great look. If there was a better secondary build than the cones and a cleaner hood, it would be perfect. Still, I strongly recommend you snatch this one up, even better if it&#39;s on sale.&nbsp;</p>

"riot","2020-05-04T21:34:53.783Z","Very good set, but needs tweaking in order to better represent the real Porsche 911 3.0 car","<p>Just got this set after recently playing Forza Horizon 4 (not the lego dlc) and wanted to have a cool car figurine to keep on my desk. I am not big lego fan at only 37 sets, of which only a handful were acquired at adulthood. But I do like to treat myself from time to time with something nice :)</p>

<p>Anyway, I just finished building this and overall I like this set a lot, trying to keep things structured here are my pros and cons:</p>

<p>+ the car is quite big, I was expecting a much smaller one. It has the same footprint as my 6&quot; smartphone</p>

<p>+ building experience was fun, there are a lot of things done differently here and I saw some pieces I never saw before. I like that it&#39;s not built using a chassis frame</p>

<p>+ has a cool Porsche-branded figurine</p>

<p>+ the wheel rims are rad and I love how the technics piece fits perfectly inside</p>

<p>- the stickers are a pain to put on as most have to be symmetrical. I probably fiddled 10 minutes with each sticker pair until they lined up perfectly and look balanced. So that&#39;s 30 minutes of sticker fiddling I want back!</p>

<p>- spoiler is the weakest part, it looks too boxy and rather flimsy</p>

<p>- the front window is definitely placed too much towards the back of the car. It needs offset 1 row to the front of the car. Also, it&#39;s very poorly secured by just 1 row of studs</p>

<p>- the car has overall too many studs, they definitely should&#39;ve used more flat pieces especially above the back wheels and on the hood.</p>

<p>- no idea why instructions only put 1 exhaust pipe, when the original car definitely has 2 exhaust pipes. Luckily there&#39;s an extra piece included :)</p>

<p>- I know I&#39;m really picky, but the ventilation grill at the back, before the spoiler is too thing and too wide. It needs to be 2x2 or 2x4 in the worst case. Also there is a bit of inconsistency with the black/white on the spoiler, the 2x2 black piece should be white or the whole thing should be black.</p>

<p>- I feel the lego version of the 1974 Porsche 911 3.0 is too long. It definitely needs to be 20% shorter so I would modify it and remove 2 rows from its entire length</p>

"Sobel","2020-07-06T14:58:18.137Z","One of my favorite classic sports cars, well made into a LEGO model!","<p>Immediately after having built my first two Speed Champion Sets (the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76895-1/Ferrari-F8-Tributo"">Ferrari F8 Tributo</a> and the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76897-1/1985-Audi-Sport-Quattro-S1"">Audi Quattro</a>), I realized, I am surely getting addicted to these sets. So I went on and ordered this set and the Ferrari F40 instantly. #noregrets When I realized, that this model is only six knobs wide, I was a little disappointed at first, it looks more like a standard LEGO City car. But the design and details made up for that.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set held no new parts for me, basically a lot of sloped bricks and a fair amount of stickers (eight, if I recall it right). Unfortunately, these are transparent stickers, so you can see every fingerprint on them. Also, if you have to reposition a sticker, like I had to, they come off very difficultly and it leaves them with crumpled edges, which doesn&#39;t look very nice.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One driver is included. He has a helmet and a brown hair piece which can be switched. Also included are three orange traffic cones for some test-driving. I use them as separators between my four cars.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A very simple build from bottom to top. Some parts are attached vertically on the go, like the front and rear bumpers and the &ldquo;door&rdquo; parts. The wheels are not individually attached, but to a TECHNIC cross axle at each end of it. The large spoiler is a separately built piece which is simply attached to car without further fixations. Watch out for the &quot;window&quot;-stickers on the hind part of the roof, the black part can easily be attached in the wrong direction!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>With this set being of an earlier generation as the two mentioned in the introduction, it is only six knobs wide, instead of eight. I only realized this when I built it. Nevertheless, it still nicely depicts the look of this iconic classic sports car. Especially the back with the red backlights looks very convincing. The traffic cones are a welcome addition, especially when used as a playset. The stickers add nicely to the design, even though this set suffers the same problem as the Ferrari F8, not being able to completely reproduce the round shape of the car body. Also, it has no rearview mirrors.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Despite being a smaller set (not in length, though), the Porsche 911 is still a very nice addition to the Speed Champions series. I&#39;m a huge fan of classic Porsche cars, so, once again, I&#39;m a little biased. I like how the classic large wheelhouses are made and the oversized rims fit perfectly to the design. The huge spoiler looks very cool and has always been one of my favourite parts in this type of car. The colours of the interior give a hint of burl wood and light leather, nice detail.<br />
As mentioned before, this set unfortunately also can&#39;t quite capture the round and curvy body of the actual car. Also, the aforementioned transparent stickers are not so much my liking. The nice looking spoiler is not very robust, though, and tends to break off when grabbed a little tighter.<br />
So, while having some minor flaws, this set shows that the designers did their best to recreate this classic sports car. And me, personally, I&#39;m quite satisfied with the outcome!</p>

<p>LEGO Speed Champion line of sets are traditionally geared (all pun attended) towards two main builders; younger kids and gearheads! Like always, LEGO has nailed the 1974 Porsche set by making it accessible for both fan bases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Design:<br />
Porsche is well known for their streamlined looks and beautiful lines, and LEGO has done a fantastic job in incorporating them with basic LEGO pieces. The iconic Headlight cans and lamps are well represented, while a true to form hatch of the back is nicely set against the car spoiler.</p>

<p>Difficulty:<br />
Can&#39;t really complain here, but as expected this set was quite easy to build. Only a handful of sub-assemblies are present in the build which then attach to form the chassis, the cockpit, the body and finish details. All-in all there are no new or unique techniques that I found interesting while building the car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>How fun was it to build?<br />
Judging a LEGO set that has under 300 pieces, that takes roughly 20-30 minutes to complete is difficult to have fun with. Feels like the build is over just as you got started. The highlight of the build, and the only place where I got a thrill out of, was while making the headlight lamps that look very true to real life 911 lights.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can I play with it?<br />
Very much so! As LEGO has been making car since roughly 1961, making car sets is definitely in their &quot;wheelhouse&quot;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Bang for your buck:<br />
At around $15 it is near impossible to say that this set is overpriced or not good value for the price you&#39;re paying. It also makes a great gift!</p>

"TeddytheSpoon","2020-12-28T14:16:41.963Z","Carbon copy Porsche nevertheless makes an attractive model","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The build: </b>this set is unusual within the Speed Champions catalogue in that it is the second time this particular car has appeared in this format, having previously appeared in green alongside a modern 911 RSR in #75888 in 2018*. LEGO seems to have taken the &lsquo;if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it&rsquo; approach to #75895, as it is virtually identical to its lime green predecessor; as far as this writer can tell, there is a grand total of one piece swap between the two (oh, and one sticker fewer). In isolation, the build is not bad by Speed Champions standards: some neat SNOT work, but nothing ground-breaking. The faint smell of laziness brought about by the carbon copy recolour is disappointing for collectors, but even if you don&rsquo;t own the previous version, there are more inspiring build choices among the Speed Champions lineup. <b>6/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The figures: </b>the driver of this particular Porsche is also somewhat unusual as he is not sporting a race suit (although he does still have a crash helmet&hellip; Go figure). Instead, he sports a smart brown (presumably) leather jacket over a white t-shirt emblazoned with the Porsche logo, and plain black trousers. It makes a nice change to the normal attire of Speed Champions drivers, and is perfect if you want to add some automotive flair to a City crowd or sig-fig. The inclusion of a hairpiece to replace the helmet is also appreciated. <b>9/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Play value: </b>as with other sets of this ilk, the play value tends to depend on the accessories included in the absence of another car to race. In this case, the 911 is accompanied by three paltry cones, so that you can form a short slalom, or part of a corner, or&hellip; roadworks? As with the car itself, this is not the first time cones have appeared in a set, having previously sat alongside the Bugatti Chiron and McLaren P1 sets, and as with the build, they feel like a bit of a lazy addition. The absence of the wheel cover pieces means that there isn&rsquo;t even a wrench included for the driver to play mechanic. Hopefully you like driving solo&hellip; <b>4/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Model value: </b>while &lsquo;if it ain&rsquo;t broke, don&rsquo;t fix it&rsquo; may have worked against this set in the build phase of this review, once the model is finished, there is no denying that &lsquo;it&rsquo; certainly &lsquo;ain&rsquo;t broke&rsquo;: #75895 is a very attractive rendition of a very attractive car. One can level the usual criticisms at the effect the minifigure&rsquo;s unusual shape on that of the car (the rear wing especially is comically large), but that would frankly be nitpicking. The white paint job looks particularly elegant, and arguably makes it look even better than its green twin. <b>9/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Overall verdict: </b>a mixed bag. The copy-paste job from #75888 reeks of making a quick buck off a loose tie-in to the (excellent, by the way) Forza Horizon 4 video game, and the extras add very little to the set. However, of all the cars in the repertoire that could have been copied, LEGO certainly picked one of the better ones, and the driver is worth a second mention. If you missed out on #75888, this is a good alternative. And for completionists, I have to admit that seeing the two 911 Turbos side-by-side is more than a bit cool. <b>7/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><i>*Incidentally, the other two are the Porsche 919 Hybrid, that appeared in both #75876 and #75887, and the Ferrari 488 from #75886 and #75889. Whether these are indeed the same car is up for debate &ndash; the 488 is technically two different cars, being the GT3 and GTE specification respectively, while the 919 did receive upgrades (and a new livery) between 2016 and 2018 when its sets were released. Putting motorsport nerdiness aside, however, they are essentially the same vehicle.</i></p>

"CPMoellering","2021-03-01T17:46:56.817Z","Not bad, not great","<p>I saw this set in Target and dropped a not-so subtle hint and what do you now, I got it for my birthday.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a cute little set, for what it is. I&#39;ll probably leave it as a display piece for the foreseeable future, since it&#39;s small, and one of my favorite sports cars.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s not bad for a 6-stud wide model of a real-world car. I understand the limits of the media here. But it&#39;s those limits that also bug me a bit.</p>

<p>First, the amount the rims protrude from the tires seems a bit odd to me.</p>

<p>The overall model seems slightly long to me, proportion wise, but I can accept that on such a small model.</p>

<p>Finally, trying to scale anything from the real world into minifig scale is a well-known challenge because of their odd proportions. That this car is simultaneously too big and too small just illustrates this fact. It should be much shorter, but it should also fit two people in the cockpit.</p>

<p>Overall, like a said, not a bad little set, for what it is. Not a ridiculous amount of decals, and it&#39;s fun to push around the table and drift it a bit. Maybe I&#39;ll try tweaking it one of these days.</p>
