<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BOX AND OVERALL DESIGN:</p>

<p>this box was unusually hefty for the 20$ price tag, the largest 20$ LEGO minecraft set i have found over the years.</p>

<p>BUILDING:</p>

<p>this set was great to build in the first half but once you got to the 2ND bag it became painfully and boring... the 2nd bag is used to make the parts of the parts of the pixel art...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MINI FIGURES</p>

<p>this contains 4 mini figures</p>

<p>STEVE: i currently drowning in this figure, there has been so many Steves its no longer funny, weilds a shear.</p>

<p>SHEEP[red] this sheep is red, it has been made before an was in the in the skeleton attack</p>

<p>SHEEP[yellow] this sheep is yellow and exclusive to this set</p>

<p>SHEEP[white][baby] this is a baby sheep possibly exclusive to this set</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MAIN SET</p>

<p>this se is focused of the big pixel art build, so far theres 3 different builds you can make with this.</p>

<p>SHEEP[mega] a giant sheep build that i like to call, MEGA SHEEP</p>

<p>PARROT: this build can be easly built</p>

<p>HEART:also easy but its the most simplistic</p>

<p>OVERALL THOUGHTS</p>

<p>this set is decent with the main feature and the figures, but other than that this set does not have much going for it</p>

<p>IMPROVEMENTS</p>

<p>a way to improve this set is to add a unique skin character or a villager farmer. the old villagers are outdated due to the 1.14 update, this would make villagers more desirable and unique.</p>
