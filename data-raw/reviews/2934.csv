"Novelty","2007-05-05T14:58:18.937Z","Dinosaucers","This plane is cool for such a small set.  It looks great and is solidly built and designed.  What would have made it better play wise would have been to add a baby pterosaur to the set to do battle with the plane.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-05T14:36:24.763Z","Johnny thunder with a plane","This is another small set with the main character of the adventurer's story, a good way to have one, but not for now, many time after that was released. The set consists in a plane with the minifigure and little additions, but looks like very with other small sets of the same subtheme. Things that makes this set useful are the colors, like very used gray on old and new sets and the red, a cool but not very used color. A propeller and wheels are too included to like with the other planes, but these can't keep the plane in feet. The additions are few, like the hat and the pistol of the minifigure. This set, altough small, is good builted, have too a piece that looks like be an old motor of old vehicles.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The plane looks like one you see at a kiddie ride. It does include Johnny Thunder which is good, but this set isn't bad.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-20T10:15:53.007Z","LEGO Adventurers (Dino Island) - Johnny Thunder's Plane Review","This set is good little impulse set to have. The built is very easy and quick. The small plane is very sturdy but it doesn't have any play features. The only feature which we get is that the propeller does sviwel full 360Â°. You also get another Johnny Thunder minifig. This set also doesn't have any stickers which you have to put on and you're also able to get a comic. If you want to buy this I would recommend you to buy the bigger sets first before you get this plane.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"SilveR96","2016-07-06T04:38:21.82Z","Adorable Little Plane","<p>For my first ever review, this is my first ever LEGO set. A lot of nostalgia for a small but cool set</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The box and instructions were standard for tiny sets like these, nothing to note really (as with most sets)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The rotor piece is nice to get, they were still using the old grey/dark grey so if you need those colors, well you can buy them online easily&nbsp;anyway</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Standard Jonny Thunder in his desert gear, prints on the front of torso and head, he is my first fig and just super cool regardless of age. He also comes with two revolvers also in the old dark grey</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a tiny build, I mean you could just look at one image and know how to build it. Nothing fancy, no interesting techniques, all studs on top and what not</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>I like it a lot, it&#39;s really simple, but anyone can look at it and be like &quot;that&#39;s a piston engine plane&quot;. It gets the idea across pretty well and is also adorable.</p>

<p>Play features include the ability to rotate the rotor, and push it on the floor on its wheels</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This was my first every LEGO set and opened up a brand new world without me even knowing about it. It is small and inexpensive (a free promotional in my case), and is a nice small set to play with</p>

"J14T14","2020-09-03T18:23:51.65Z","Simple, but effective","<p>I bought this set off of eBay recently as I had never owned a Johnny Thunder set and this one was pretty affordable on the secondary market. As my first Adventurers set, it&#39;s not bad but it&#39;s not great also.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Set</strong></p>

<p>The plane itself is pretty simple, only comprising 17 pieces. A small comic book was also included, but it is nothing special. The set itself has apace for one minifigure to sit on it. The propeller can spin as can the wheels used for landing gear. There is a steering wheel, but no windshield. It is a fun little thing for kids but has no display value for adults outside of nostalgia.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>This set comes with some pieces in old light grey and old dark grey, but other than that every piece in this set is still in production and there doesn&#39;t seem to be any rare parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The minifigure included is just your standard Johnny Thunder, who comes in several other sets throughout this theme. He comes with his classic pistol and hat.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This set is a nice impulse buy but doesn&#39;t offer anything special besides&nbsp;the minifigure. Even then he is pretty common and has no exclusive prints or pieces. I would recommend this as a cheap way to get Johnny Thunder if you don&#39;t have one already or if you just want to complete the theme in your collection.</p>
