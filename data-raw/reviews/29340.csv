"alfred_the_buttler","2020-12-15T06:09:33.05Z","Great First Lego Set","<p>Technically this isn&#39;t my daughter&#39;s first Lego set, I tried getting her a 4+ set last year when she was almost 4, but it was too hard for her and got ignored and forgotten. However, this past year she has really enjoyed building with her brothers Legos as he is trying to build things (much to his annoyance), and then when we got Lego Mario a few months ago she really became interested. I asked if she would like some Frozen Lego sets and she said yes to my surprise. When she got this as a gift I must admit she was a little confused as to why she was getting Legos and not stuffed animals (she also got a stuffed animal, don&#39;t worry). Anyways after playing with some other presents she got first, she sat down with her stuffed animal and built this set pretty much all by herself. She asked me to help, but really all I did was sit with her and remind her to read the instructions left to right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her brother owned a lot of Juniors sets at this age, and those have now simply been rebranded as 4+, they still utilize many of the same large parts and everything is printed (no stickers). There are handful of small parts such as leafs and crystals, but the only one that proved to be too difficult was the yellow carrot leaf which is hard to push through a whole.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set comes with Anna and Olaf which is great, but inevitably leads to the question of where&#39;s Elsa. She got Elsa the following night, I&#39;m not sure why I gave her these sets in this order, I should have realized Elsa needs to be first, but I thought having two minifigures would be more fun. Of course these are minidolls, not technically minifigures and that is a little confusing. For one, their legs don&#39;t move independently and it isn&#39;t very clear which direction they go on to a 4 year old, which is another problem since they only bend one way. The other issue is the capes. Unlike a minifigure cape which is securely held in place by the head, on a mini doll they sit loosely around the neck and are constantly on the wrong side. To make matters worse, trying to pull the cape around onto their back causes it to get stuck in the hair. So you have to take off the hair, pull around the cape, put back on the hair, which sends the cape back to the side or front, and repeat this process 10 times until stays in the back. Then you do this all again after another 3 minutes. I find this whole process incredibly frustrating, but my daughter doesn&#39;t seem to care so I guess it doesn&#39;t matter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set itself is rather nice, basically a playground which makes it very fun to play with, and a boat so you have something to drive around. Like any Juniors set that relies on large poorly attached bases and sloped tiles, it all falls apart very easily, especially on carpet where kids play, but kids don&#39;t seem to mind, and my daughter is quite proud that she can fix it. Perhaps this weak design is intentional as Lego knows kids like to fix it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In&nbsp;conclusion, this is a great introduction to Lego for kids who have outgrown Duplos. The price is outrageously high, even with a Black Friday discount, but when viewed as a toy as opposed to a Lego set, it does seem reasonable, and more importantly, it is an educational tool as your child is reading instructions for the first time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My daughter now has three of the 4+ sets and access to her brother&#39;s Juniors sets which he has outgrown and will gladly give her, so I doubt I&#39;ll be buying more. But this is a great introduction to the Disney Princess line and I can see her getting some more advanced sets once she turns five.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-30T23:04:53.77Z","Easy to Fall Apart, but Not Bad.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #41165 Anna&rsquo;s Canoe Expedition:</b> I haven&rsquo;t bought a Mini-Doll set in a while, but when they offered a free Frozen II set with purchase I finally got back into the Theme. Frozen II is releasing soon and the two sets I picked up first are actually both of the 4+ sets from the Sub-Theme. So the builds are fairly simple and easy, but rather interesting. This set includes some nice pieces on top of being a cute little playset to enjoy with your favorite Arendelle Princess.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Frozen II is prominently shown and the shot of Anna and Elsa is in the front of the package in animated form. The front of the box shows the set and all its fun, while the back indicates that the set is a Perfect Start, a new logo different from the Easy to Build of LEGO Juniors.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is pretty impressive too, besides the pages for the build there&rsquo;s a really nice animated piece showing a map of the area the film will explore and where each set fits into the scenes found in the film. Everything else is still included, parts lists, LEGO Life ads and those sorts of things.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Included in this set is one BURP, two printed ramp element, two purple 4+ Base plates, two orange leaf elements, a blue slide, a printed 1x6 tall wall element, Olaf&rsquo;s new body and head pieces, a printed piece for some creature that is sleeping or in stasis and the new lamp element introduced with Wizarding World sets. A very nice selection of parts for a 4+ set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Mini-Dolls</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Anna: The new look for Anna has a very nice cloak and a brand new hair piece that is a really good design, the flowing hair is pretty impressive and her new outfit print is a nice subdued looking tone which contrasts quite nicely with her sister. The darker black tones fit her quite nicely. She doesn&rsquo;t have any accessories, but she does have a very nice new cloak piece which I mentioned before.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Olaf: This is the same figure as the Olaf Sleigh giveaway. There&rsquo;s nothing much different here, no change to the print, to the head piece or anything else. It&rsquo;s Olaf, and he likes warm hugs. (And now he can actually give them because he has proper arms.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Anna and her Canoe are included here along with half of a larger model which represents a small river passing. All of these builds take very little time to complete, as a 4+ set it isn&rsquo;t difficult to follow along and snap the parts together to finish off the model. It&rsquo;s highly impressive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Olaf and a little bunny can help to construct the other side of the river and a small hutch area for the rabbit to live. Again this is a quick and easy build fitting a 4+ set, however some of the parts do like to come apart too easily, meaning it can be frustrating to build this anywhere other than a hard, flat surface such as a table or desk.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Compared to the Elsa set this model is a lot flimsier. It is a small river crossing from what I can see which features a slide representing water falling down from what may be a mountain stream. There&rsquo;s a nice boat included which is a more solid model, and the small bunny hatch. It&rsquo;s a more cohesive model design, but it does like to fall apart far too easily.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The set seems almost like a strange Frozen playground, you&rsquo;ve got your slide, you have a teeter-totter and some kind of rock face monster thing and then a boat to ride on. Pretty much the largest draw of the set will be Anna&rsquo;s new look.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is a bit less impressive than Elsa&rsquo;s 4+ set, the model is much too easy to break apart while playing, just moving it from the table to the floor will cause parts to fall off from the main baseplate because there are no really solid connections. The teeter-totter moves far too easily as well and isn&rsquo;t built very good. It is too bad the model wasn&rsquo;t as solid, it would have made it better for playing. I think the canoe itself will get the most fun out of this set, so I&rsquo;d suggest either picking this up on a sale, or using VIP points to get it free, because it is definitely not worth the full asking price. Semi-Recommended.</p>
