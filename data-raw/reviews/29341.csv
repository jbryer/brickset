But the real highlight is the reindeer with its young animal. Otherwise, the set is very minimalistic and typically colourful. Whereby the dwelling is for the rubbish can. It is also a pity that the reindeer does not have a matching stone (gray) for the saddle area.</p>

<p>This is a very fun set and essential for any Frozen fan as it contains Elsa! It also contains Sven and a baby reindeer which were a huge hit. Combine it with 41165 and you have all the main characters but Kristoff, but girls don&#39;t seem to mind that he&#39;s missing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main build to this set is the carriage pulled by Sven and it allows for a lot of fun as you can pull Elsa (and one other figure) around. The building isn&#39;t too exciting, just a small single room with some storage, but outside you can roast a marshmallow over a campfire. Now the marshmallow offers very little play value, you can simply rotate it on or off of the fire, it&#39;s a marshmallow so kids love it! However, your kids will enjoy playing with the playground that comes with 41165 a lot more as there really isn&#39;t anything you can do with the building in this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now the issue with this set is the price, it&#39;s the same size as 41165 yet costs $10 more and one less minifigure. Does Sven and a baby reindeer really cost $10 more? Or did Lego realize that your daughter needs to have Elsa so no price is to high for a set that includes her? Oh well, this set has Elsa so Lego wins and it&#39;s hard to put a price on your daughter&#39;s happiness.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-30T23:07:41.217Z","Elsa 4+ set is the better bargain.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #41166 Elsa&rsquo;s Wagon Adventure:</b> We are now going to discuss the second 4+ set for Frozen 2, it&rsquo;s actually interesting to note that most Disney inspired sets have become 4+, aside from the dedicated Mini-Doll Princess line all other Disney &lsquo;Themes&rsquo; have been reduced to Juniorized sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Even the Mini-Doll Theme under the Disney banner has 4+ sets. The Frozen 2 sets are separate from the Disney Theme, but still base their design and packaging on the Mini-Doll Princess line. Anyway, I digress, let&rsquo;s discuss Elsa&rsquo;s Wagon Adventure. Of note, I based this review on the name on the box of the set rather than Brickset&rsquo;s listing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The packaging is the same as was discussed in the Anna set, with the 4+ logo front and center and a nice shot of the set on the front and back of the package. The front has an action shot with Elsa and the Reindeer, while the back showcases all of the separate models and items you will find in this set with the Perfect Start logo on the back.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is a nice thick card stock with easy to follow along with steps for the build. Something to note is that LEGO Life has become extremely prevalent, QR Codes and ads for LEGO Life are everywhere in the models of late, even with some pages dedicated exclusively to the LEGO Life app or network or whatever it is. (I&rsquo;m pretty sure it&rsquo;s an App.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The back pages contain a nice map of the world of Frozen with all of the sets shown and a LEGO version of the animated logo seen on the front of the boxes.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">More and more 4+ sets have unique junior elements with printed detailing. There&rsquo;s some printed carpet tile and a printed ramp as well as a printed brick with a forest backdrop, some printed 1x4 bricks are also included, a few large base plate elements standard in this set range are also included in a light purple.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Mini-Doll</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Elsa: This is actually my very first Mini-Doll version of Elsa, I&rsquo;ve missed out on a lot of Frozen sets for quite some time now. This new version of Elsa is still using the same hair piece I believe, complete with two holes for hair accessories. She has a very stunning cape element which is cut in the back to hang down over either shoulder. She has a pretty decent torso and leg print with some stunning ice theme decorations, her neck even has flecks of shiny something there, I&rsquo;m not sure if this is meant to be jewelry or if her magic has begun to manifest icy skin when she&rsquo;s using it. She has no hand-held accessories.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Sven: I&rsquo;ve discussed him before, in my earlier Frozen set review with Anna and Sven, this animal piece looks great and has a pretty decent sculpt. You can stick carrots in his mouth, he does love them after all, and there are two holes on either side of his torso for bows or other accessories to attach to, which are not included in this set unfortunately.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Baby Deer: This new animal piece is brand new and represents possibly a new character from Frozen II. I still haven&rsquo;t seen the film yet so I&rsquo;m not sure, this is a baby Reindeer, so not the same as the Baby Deer seen in LEGO Friends. It&rsquo;s a really cute animal and includes a hole on the top of their head for accessories.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Elsa and Sven work together to build a small wagon that Sven can pull. This build is pretty quick and typical of 4+ sets. There are no issues with following along and getting the model completed in a timely fashion, most sets in this range rarely have problems in building. Now this is from the perspective of an AFOL granted, so it is possible that 4 year olds might have issues, I don&rsquo;t feel there&rsquo;s anything that would hinder their ability unless they had difficulty recognizing which parts to use when during the build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: The Baby Deer helps build a small stable, feeding station, present and picnic blanket, all of which are quick and simple to follow along with. Completing everything lets you have some models to quickly play with and have an adventure with Elsa and her animal companions. What else can I say? These builds are really simplistic with less pieces to worry about.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a wonderful selection of items to play with for younger fans. The main build is Elsa&rsquo;s wagon, and it is a pretty solid and hefty bit of LEGO, with it Sven and Elsa can travel anywhere and enjoy having a Picnic or delivering cookies to people.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Baby Deer hangs out in a little stable complete with feeding area and includes a brush to brush his or her fur, roasting off on the side is a single marshmallow. And Elsa has a nice little picnic area with a blanket to sit on a purple basket and a mug with bottle to enjoy some sparkling soda or something.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As these sets are designed for 4+ builders it&rsquo;s up to the imaginative play of the builders to find everything and enjoy everything with these sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">For the price and what you&rsquo;re getting in this set some have complained quite a bit concerning these Frozen II sets. Especially as these are meant to be for a younger builder and so the parts are larger and add slightly to LEGO&rsquo;s pricing scheme. That being said this is a pretty impressive and cheap set for Elsa and Sven, the Baby Deer included in this set is a nice addition as well and nothing about the set seems to spoil the storyline of the movie if you haven&rsquo;t seen it yet.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;d say these 4+ sets are a pretty good value, and much better than some of the larger sets in the Theme. For that reason I&rsquo;d recommend getting them if you&rsquo;d like to get the new prints for Elsa and Anna without spending too much. Mildly Recommended.</p>
