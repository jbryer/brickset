<p>3 floors, each one is easy to remove and play on each separately.</p>

<p>Ease to remove interiors in order to redecorate.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The additional sides with pier and boat,&nbsp;bakery stand with goods and lamp post are nice.</p>

<p>Great figures with different style of Anna, Elsa and Kristoff.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>You get quite a lot of different options to play on this set. The quality of the brickcolours&nbsp;are good. They do not change within in a colour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The RRP is a little expensive.&nbsp;</p>
