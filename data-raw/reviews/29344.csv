<p>Olaf is a set that would display perfectly next to the semi-UCS star wars brick built big characters.</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build has a perfect head build with an open mouth&nbsp; using two 1&times;1 corner tiles for his single tooth , a carrot for his nose , two 2&times;2 printed eyes and his twig hair on top . The torso has a 1&times;1 black circular tile for a lump of coal and his arms are basic and not particularly poseable . The lowest part of the build is the main base it a has two more lumps of coal one of which is at an angle the shaping around to get the wide round circumference is that and the feel while not poseable are perfect part useage . The extra builds include a very nice scrap book with a sticker on the front a sticker on the inside with his name and three more inside depicting him in various scenarios . The other builds also include a bow tie you can take the coal of the torso and put the tie in instead and finally there is a great build for a pencil that he can hold in either hand or be displayed with the scrap book .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is the best Disney princess set that has ever been released and from what I have seen most people share that opinion I would highly recommend it to any frozen fans , Lego fans or a parts pack .</p>
