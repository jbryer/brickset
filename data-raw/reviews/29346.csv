","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Introduction</b> &ndash; Death Start cannons have been made before but they continue to refine the design. This set pulled me in with the new Obi-Wan figure and I felt like the other aspects of the set could be used in other builds.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Minifigures</b> &ndash; 5/5 Obi-Wan&rsquo;s figure here is great with the brand new hood piece. I honestly bought this set because I wanted to see this new hood for myself. Call it nostalgia but I prefer the older version of hoods as this feels incomplete without the connection below the minifigure head. Similar to a towel draped over one&#39;s head as opposed to a connected cloth.&nbsp;I loved getting a cloth cape to represent Kenobi&rsquo;s robe. I wish Lego would do more cape pieces as they seem to be rare in the last few years! The Imperial gunner is a great minifigure to amass. I love the printing, it&rsquo;s a top notch figure that in my personal opinion can&rsquo;t get any better!</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The Build</b> &ndash; 4/5 This was a quick build which felt more like a battle pack side build but I can appreciate where they went with this. I love the opening structure that houses the cannon. This is well done and I&rsquo;d love to see these doorway like structures continue in small Lego sets. The cannon itself has a good amount of detail that I can appreciate as it feels complete. The Tractor Beam control is clever and has a nice little play feature.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Parts</b> &ndash; 5/5 Very effective use of parts in this set. It is a low piece count but I&rsquo;m not sure where they would have added pieces. It&rsquo;s a small set but well done in the execution. I suppose if you didn&rsquo;t want to use the build, the parts would be repurposed easily in other builds.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Value</b> &ndash; 4/5 This set feels like a battle pack with less figures. With that being said the size of the built model is bigger than most battle packs so I suppose there is value added there but $20 USA feels steep. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong I like the set, I think it&rsquo;s nice but the value at retail is a stretch. &nbsp;I think there will be plenty of these sets on the shelves to find one at a discount. It&rsquo;s not a must have by any means, but a neat little set for a quick build and if you like the Obi-Wan Kenobi figure.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Overall</b> &ndash; 4/5 This set is much more a toy than any sort of collection piece which is totally acceptable. Lego is for kids and adults alike so fair to lean in one direction or the other on certain sets. I think the target audience of kids will appreciate this as it&rsquo;s not too much to handle as far as builds go and you do get some good figures. The play features also lend well to the younger crowd. As an adult fan this set leaves little to be desired but for a kid, this set would be fun, and easy build and full of play features!</p>
