<p>A very fun building experience which took about an hour or so to complete. The set looks absolutely awesome when completed and has [landing gear] which allows it to stand up nicely on your display shelf.</p>

<p>A good set which I got for about 25 pounds so well worth the money!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Highly recommend.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-10-25T05:20:59.127Z","A Very Solid A-Wing","<p>Of all the ships used by the Rebels and the Resistance, the A-Wing to me is probably the least interesting. Yet, the A-Wing plays a major role in the movies so I felt as if I needed to add one to my fleet. Luckily this set is very affordable and looks much better than some of the earlier iterations. Most importantly, Lego actually reduced the brick count and price from previous sets, something that I&#39;ve never seen them do.</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Snap Wexley is the pilot and Lieutenant Connix accompanies him. Both are&nbsp;very welcome inclusions as they aren&#39;t characters that have been represented before and both played decent roles the sequel trilogy. Both of them look great, and I especially like Snap&#39;s helmet with the trans-yellow visor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Model</p>

<p>The model, while small, actually has a pretty engaging build. For the most part it is just simple stacking, and despite it being symmetrical, doesn&#39;t feel too repetitive. It is very simple for the most part, even the two engines aren&#39;t revolutionary. The best part of them is that Lego developed a new brick for the wings for their previous iteration&nbsp;that looks incredibly accurate. It also does a great job of creating the proper angle for the wings, although they do have a bit of wiggle which is a little disappointing but not problematic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model itself is incredibly solid, which is great given its size, it&#39;s perfect for flying around your house. It does feature a large number of stickers, and while they do greatly improve the overall look, two stickers are placed over the clear, curved windshield, I couldn&#39;t possibly think of a more difficult part to place not one but two stickers on. The set also doesn&#39;t include any controls or gauges in the cockpit, despite the fact that it leaves a row of studs in front and along both sides of the pilot unadorned. There is no reason why they couldn&#39;t have included 5 more bricks in this set and created some awesome looking controls. I guess I&#39;ll need to do that myself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set has a single play feature, spring loaded shooters, which are integrated perfectly. They are underneath the ship and are activated by a technic beam that just barely sticks out above the front of the ship and isn&#39;t even noticeable. Quite honestly, I&#39;ve never seen spring loaded shooters integrated so well. You also get three landing stands that fold up. They aren&#39;t beautiful, but they do the job. Although the front stand is higher up in the fuselage which makes the ship tilt down while on the ground.</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>While the set was originally $30, it is now available for $25 which is a very good value. The A-Wing looks as good as you could expect it to and is perfect for playing with. The inclusion of two uncommon minifigures is also nice as they are characters we probably won&#39;t see again. Like I said, I don&#39;t find this ship terribly exciting in the Star Wars galaxy, so this very reasonably priced set is a great way to obtain one while setting aside more money for more important ships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The resistance RZ-2 A-wing is such a sleek set with a great colours and a Swooshable design with good value .</p>

<p>The Minifigures -</p>

<p>Snap Wexley is a great character with lots of development out of the films in the aftermath book trilogy , he has an accurate helmet which is surprisingly detailed , a tired bearded face print and the torso and legs have a continuous fight suit print , Lieutenant Connix , played by Carrie Fishers (RIP) daughter and is a great figure which could have a fairly high price in future , the hair is the Endor Leia hair in light nougat , the face has a happy and stern expression , the torso has a jacket and rank badge and the legs are unprinted . The accessories are a pistol for Snap and a mid sized rifle for Connix .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The A-wing is the resistance RZ-2 model compared to the RZ-1 original trilogy model , the hood uses some dark green slopes and tiles with stickers applied , the sides use two large white slopes with stickers to complete the central green stripe , the middle uses a very good technique for shooting the spring loaded shooters which is very affective and blends into the ventilation detailing around it , the central sides feature a republic emblem on the left which is not the new republic logo so that is interesting , the other side is plain but still slopes tiled and studless and two 2&times;2 gold bars are used for more accents around the cockpit . The interior has no console or controls unfortunately , a good seat and the cockpit features two incredibly tedious stickers to put on the part , behind the cockpit there is an assembly which slopes off and finishes the back well , the cannons on each side can swivel 360 degrees , the very end between the thrusters features a build for some mechanical detailing , there is also a 1&times;4 dark green stickered tile on each side of the back of the cockpit and the thrusters consist of snot and technic techniques and each have two big white fin ontop and below on each and the bottom both have stickers , the sides have a grille and a 2&times;3 tile in which the left features a sticker and the very ends use thin technic wheels two on each and a 2&times;2 Trans yellow cylinder to make the thrusters indicate what they represent .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a great A-wing and looks incredible and has fun features ,perfect for all ages and demographics and it is a good thing that Lego didn&#39;t do their usual &quot;let&#39;s throw in a step ladder and weapon rack &quot; which are just things that lost overtime , so it is simple straight to the point and panders towards all ages and demographics of Lego star wars fans so I recommend it to all .&nbsp;</p>
