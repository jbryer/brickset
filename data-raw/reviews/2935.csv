The design of the swamp boat is basic, but makes complete sense and looks kinda cool. Plus, you get a propeller plus the rare brown Pterodactyl. Nearly all good.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-05-05T14:56:44.873Z","Flying with Dinosaurs","The little swamp boat is nothing exciting - in fact it seems a little bit bare bones, but only because this is such a small set.  The colour scheme is a bit odd as well.  It comes with a pterosaur which is a bit weird since it would have been better to have a crococile or something that lives in the water.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-09-05T09:41:36.77Z","Even Babies are a Pain","This is the second one of these four i have had the pleasure of reviewing. This one is a little swamp boat. Like the other it is pretty plain has a small fan at the back but that is the only real feature. The model itself is a real no brainer but for like $3 AU what do you expect and is very solid and aesthetically pleasing.

The mini-fig looks different and very suited to the job. Also the baby pterodactyl is good for causing him problems. If for no other reason get it for this.

The model also came with a comic which was quite good actually. All of the adventure series did and most fitted together to make a nice little story. I have the other three models that are this ones partners and I have built the plane which is quite good so the combined price of all four make a good model and give you some extras, it really depends on what you want in your collection.

Overall the model is basic but good and gets a solid 5/10. A good addition for any collector or lover of the adventure series or just a nice one to have.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-05T14:51:18.547Z","In swamp with dinosaurs","This is another of the little sets of the Dino Island, this is another vehicle, not a plane, but a boat with a propeller on it's back to looks like with a hovercraft. The minifigure was included with another limited release of sweets in japan, and is named Mike. This is a different minifigure and hard to find, don't have many ways to have it. Is included also a dinosaur with it, when it flies, the minifigure drives the boat, but his don't have controls, but a piece to the minifigure hangs. Some plates and red pieces can keeps this set in feet. The colors are too cool, like the red, that was used sometimes in the sets of this subtheme. The builting is easy, but on it can't be putted many minifigures. If with more sets, specially of this subtheme, is easy make a bigger boat, with propellers on it's back. To play with is easy, and also mix with any lego set like creator, adventurers(substituted by indiana jones) and others like city.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-20T10:21:37.02Z","LEGO Adventurers (Dino Island) - Mike's Swamp Boat Review","For a small set I think this model is okay. The set is very easy and very fast to build and it's very sturdy, too. You don't have to worry about stickers as well. The boat doesn't have any play features. The only play feature is the propeller which sviwels full 360Â°. This set is the cheapest set to get the character Mike. You also get a flying dinosaur (I forgot it's name...). If you want to get some LEGO Adventurers sets I would recommend you to get the bigger models first before you get this set.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
