<p>1. Minifigures</p>

<p>The new Rey minifigure is&nbsp;quite nice, but I believe she needs a new head. The new lightsaber&nbsp;piece is so much better than the old one.</p>

<p>BB-8&#39;s figure to me is just ok I&#39;m glad that they updated it, but I&#39;m not a big fan of the larger eyepiece.</p>

<p>The Jet Trooper is actually my 2nd&nbsp;favorite minifig&nbsp;in this set, the jet pack is so perfect and the helmet is very sleek.</p>

<p>The First Order Stormtrooper is ok, but the red mark on his torso gives him a difference than the regular ones.</p>

<p>2. Treadspeeder</p>

<p>The Treadspeeder&nbsp;has a nice color scheme and use of parts, the only things I wish were added,&nbsp;is that they gave it a clear stand piece,like they did for Rey&#39;s speeder and that there was a clear stick piece to attach at the back so that the Jettrooper&nbsp;could look like its flying.</p>

<p>3. Rey&#39;s Speeder</p>

<p>Rey&#39;s Speeder is overall a lot nicer and bigger&nbsp;than it looks on the box, the bright and dark reds come together with the dark tan and make for something you don&#39;t see often in the Lego Star Wars theme.</p>

<p>The attention to detail is very nice and I like that there are play/display features like the steering system,&nbsp;stud shooter, wires, and a clear stand.</p>

<p>4. The Outpost/Tent&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tent is a nice little add on with a few nice pieces and a versatile use.&nbsp;The only complaint is that the gray cargo box comes with nothing to put inside, but you could always use it to store the extra studs for the studshooters.</p>

<p>Overall this set is&nbsp;better than expected and one of the best out of the new Rise of Skywalker sets released.</p>

"TBillz","2020-06-02T19:58:34.923Z","""Hotwired Speeder""","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Introduction</b> &ndash; This set is based on a scene that boasts plenty of screen time for the Rise of Skywalker movie previews so let&rsquo;s dive in to see how the Lego version stacks up!</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Minifigures</b> &ndash; 8/10 Rey is adorned in white robes. Definitely a nice minifigure to complete your Rey collection as this is only one of it&rsquo;s kind as of the time of this review. BB-8 is standard here but imagine how awesome it would have been to get him with some sand details or some battle damage like we see in the movie. A reviewer can dream right? Back to reality. The FO Jet Trooper is like nothing we&rsquo;ve seen before. I really like the printing detail and there is a new Red emblemnb printed on each of the FO figures. The Treadspeeder driver too has magnificent printing with the Red emblem as well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The Build </b>&ndash; 7/10 The build breaks down into 3 parts here, a Speeder from Pasaana, a FO Treadspeeder and a small outpost supply. First off the Pasaana speeder has almost a makeshift broken down feel to it which is captured very well in this Lego form. The detail is asymmetrical and stickers do add to the detail on this set. I think it is a great reflection of it&rsquo;s real world model. It does feel a bit unstable with plenty of areas that could break. I&rsquo;m not saying I&rsquo;ve broke it but I could see younger builders damaging it or it breaking apart in storage. The Treadspeeder is a fun little build that incorporates the tread element very nicely. I think the design is well done and it does have a certain snowmobile vibe to it. Finally the Supply outpost hut build is actually an awesome addition to this set. Now in the movie it plays little to this scene but in Lego form it&rsquo;s part of the charm of this set. I see this being utilized in many Star Wars scenes in Lego collections across the galaxy. It feels like something from Jeddha City&rsquo;s streets. I love it&rsquo;s simplicity yet effectiveness. It was a quick easy build but to me serves as a bonus to your overall collection, not just this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Parts</b> &ndash; 7/10 The Passana speeder has a splash of red color which isn&rsquo;t utilized in bulk in very many Star Wars sets. Red is usually reserved for the First Order so kind of neat to see it used elsewhere. Other elements showing detail of the vessel are well done. The FO Treadspeeder has a unique amount of this sand blue color. Typically that isn&rsquo;t as dominant in the build of an Imperial or First Order ship. It almost distances it from the rest of the First Order equipment as it doesn&rsquo;t feel the same. The small accessories and build parts of the Supply Outpost are awesome. The pieces they chose for this make it very detailed at a small part count.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Value</b> &ndash; 6/10&nbsp; At first glance, retail of $40 on this set seems on the higher side. I think if you can find it closer to $30 it&rsquo;s a great buy. It contains 3 good builds with a fair amount of detail. When you factor in there are 3 minifigures, which 3 of them are considered exclusive to this set as of the time of review, I see where the price rises to $40. The amount of pieces used makes sense and I don&rsquo;t think this is one of those incomplete sets that would need additional parts out of your collection so you can build this and be done.&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Overall</b> &ndash; 7/10 This is a decent set. I appreciate the variety but it&rsquo;s not iconic and I&rsquo;m not sure how it will integrate outside of a chase scene in your collection. All in all the details are well done and it&rsquo;s got a sweet little market supply outpost. The Treadspeeder doesn&rsquo;t feel like it&rsquo;s a FO vehicle with the sand blue so prevalent. There wasn&rsquo;t anything after building it encouraging me to come back to this set. The figures will be the main draw overall, but there are cool elements like the side build. I can&rsquo;t say it is a must buy but if you enjoyed the Rise of Skywalker and like the set, it&rsquo;s a fun build and good display piece.</p>

"TheBrickDudeStudios","2020-07-08T16:03:13.127Z","Review of set 75250.","<h2>Builds</h2>

<p>There are three builds in this set. The red speeder that Rey and BB-8 ride in, The treadspeeder that the stormtroopers ride in and a side build that is like a little shack or something.</p>

<h3>Red speeder</h3>

<p>The red speeder has lots of space to put minifigs. On the front left it has a stud shooter that is easy to spot, and I am not a fan of that. On the bottom of the ship there are three clear stands so the ship can look like it is floating.It has some stickers that I wish were prints, but I am fine with that.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Treadspeeder</h3>

<p>The treadspeeder has less space to put minifigs on. On the left and the right the ship has stud shooters on it, the grey blends in with the ship but the green is so easy to spot and I do not like that. The tread on this ship moves if you push it and I like that it does.</p>

<h3>Shack (side build)</h3>

<p>The side build of this set is a shack. It does not appear in the movie but it is a good side build. It has a little container that you can put three things in. This also has a little flag on top witch is a good detail.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>This set comes with four minifigs in it, they are, Rey, BB-8, jet pack trooper and the treadspeeder&nbsp;driver.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Rey</h3>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set comes with rey. This rey has a white outfit that is different from some other versions of her.</p>

<h3>BB-8</h3>

<p>This set comes with BB-8. He has the larger eye because there is a version where his eye is smaller. Other than that, this is a normal BB-8</p>

<h3>Jet trooper</h3>

<p>This set has a jet trooper in it. he is the same as the sith jet trooper but it is white instead of red. He has a new mold for the helmet and jetpack witch I like.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Treadspeeder driver</h3>

<p>This set comes with a treadspeeder driver in it. He has the same helmet as a first order stormtrooper but it has new printing for the legs and body.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>The parts in this set are good but I think they could have used prints instead of stickers. But I think this is a good set and you should get it if it is on sale.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

"RichardRSA","2021-01-07T16:58:41.993Z","Decent Set, but it really should have Finn and Poe","<p>First off, the movie was terrible, even if this scene itself wasn&#39;t too bad.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>BB-8: It&#39;s the same as usual. Cute little guy, nice printing.</p>

<p>Rey Skywalker: Nicely detailed, pretty cool outfit. Pretty sure there&#39;s a whole bunch of them from this wave.</p>

<p>Treadspeeder Driver: Slightly different from the usual FO Stormtrooper, this guy has... marks on his chest. He&#39;ll fit in decently with other stormtroopers.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>FO Jet Trooper: They fly now! Looks pretty close to the ones in the movie and battlefront 2. Jetpack looks new too. Pretty cool dude.</p>

<p>Who&#39;s missing? Poe and Finn. They should be here. Heck, the most famous quote of the scene is from Poe! ugh.</p>

<p><strong>Builds</strong></p>

<p>Treadspeeder: A very dumb idea in a purely star warsy fashion. It feels a bit oversized, but it trundles around quite nicely and has room for both FO troopers on it. Quite solid too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pasaana Speeder: I don&#39;t know what else to call it. I love the tiller and rudders. The whole thing looks darn good, if just a hair too small. Slides around on most surfaces in a very satisfying manner. Quite solid too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pasaana... stall: Looks reasonably like the stuff that was there, but it seems a bit superfluous. The crates can go in the speeder and those parts could have been saved for, I don&#39;t know, actually including the other main characters?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The main nice parts are red tiles of various shapes and round 2x1 red plates. I&#39;m pretty sure they aren&#39;t common. But this really isn&#39;t the worst parts pack out there by any means.</p>
