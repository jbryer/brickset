<p>I was so excited&nbsp;to see this model online,&nbsp;that I&nbsp;bought it the day it was released.</p>

<p>The face is very realistic and Lego did a great&nbsp;job at capturing the Jedi robe.</p>

<p>The model looks fantastic from any angle and the minifigure&nbsp;Yoda and plaque are a nice addition to this collectible.</p>

<p>The build was also enjoyable&nbsp;and each step&nbsp;does not take long; so before you know it, you&#39;re on to the next one.</p>

<p>I enjoyed the progress of&nbsp;the build, so I completed it in one sitting.</p>

<p>My only complaint is that the minifigure is olive green,&nbsp;where as&nbsp;the completed model is sand green.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very pleased&nbsp;with this set&nbsp;and it&nbsp;was very enjoyable to build.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>

<p>I like how Lego did the robe and the cloth. It&#39;s hard to make Lego look like cloth. Every time I try to make cloth with Lego, I make a mess. If you look far enough, it looks like actual cloth.</p>

<h3>Face</h3>

<p>I feel like the face could have used some work, the area around the eyeballs should have had some fixing. But I see how hard it was to make the eyelids move if you closed up those spots.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>This is just a display piece, but I do like the eyelids and the head. All you can really do with him is flip his eyelids up and down and spin his head.</p>

<h3>Summery</h3>

<p>This was one great build for $100. The yoda multifigure was a nice touch with the stand. I think this would be good for fans and builders looking for a challenge.</p>

<p>The box was very nice and I like that it gave the dimensions of the final Yoda. Other than that typical Star Wars box &quot;very exciting&quot;.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>THE INSTRUCTIONS</strong></h2>

<p>I like how in some parts it had red highlights showing you where to lay the bricks when making the plates that go on the sides of the Technic frame.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>THE BUILD</strong></h2>

<p>The build was pretty difficult but fun and took me about 2 days. (Which I think is fast since I am only a KFOL.) Putting the technic thing in Yoda&#39;s head was veeeery difficult and his lightsaber sometimes falls or breaks. Also, I like that the hood can hold mini Yoda. He has a good range of articulation (thank you spell check) and are realistic in their movements. The little info stand makes a good edition and the brick separator was much needed :)&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>OVERALL</strong></h2>

<p>This set is great. I like that you can cut off his hand in a lightsaber duel. It is a very good size not to large not too tiny and has impressed all my friends I have showed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I never break my sets... but one gust of wind towards Yoda and he will fall over. The unsturdiest set I have every had!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>He was cool to build though. Although a lot of beige and weird edges. He could have been much better. Lightsaber is cool though.&nbsp;</p>
