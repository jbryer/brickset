"CaptainPotassium","2020-08-17T19:34:46.14Z","Best non-UCS Falcon yet","<p>The build was really fun, and the design is a big improvement on both the Force Awakens and Solo versions. The interior space, while very similar to previous versions, is still very good. Roomy and fun inside.&nbsp; Mini-figure selection is pretty good. Boolio makes a very cool inclusion, as does old Lando. Rey seems like a strange omission, but with her being in so many other sets I kind of get it. Swooshability is good with nothing coming loose or open during play. And the display value is phenomenal. Highly recommended.</p>

"ShilohCyan","2021-12-31T07:17:37.613Z","Slightly dissatisfied","<p>The only other minifig scale falcon I&#39;ve owned is the 2004 version, which I think is fine since up until now, most iterations have followed the same sort of pie-slice structure. I can&#39;t help but compare this to the 2004 version that for so long was my holy grail. It&#39;s indubitably better in most regards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Complaints first, praise in a moment.</p>

<p>First off, the coloring is weird, with large chunks of dark grey sprinkled in. Now I&#39;ve only watched Rise of Skywalker twice (for obvious reasons) but I don&#39;t think random sections of the hull were darker in the film. That annoys me.&nbsp;Second, the front prongs are too shallow, and the blocky way they&#39;re filled gets to me as well. Several pieces that were prints in the 2004, such as vents on the back, are now stickers. The cockpit is very small and could easily extend further into the canopy and a faux doorway like in the 2004 version would&#39;ve been nice. Maybe a small reference to L3 as well.&nbsp;These concerns look to be easily fixable and I&#39;ll be doing so once I&#39;ve caught up on 2022 sets I want.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tan bench by the dejarik board is in the wrong corner and that area&#39;s somewhat too crowded to easily move it. The dejarik board is printed (whew!) on a shield piece, which clips onto a stand. So not only would the domed shape not be able to feasibly hold real pieces or function as a table, it also wobbles all over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thankfully!!! this&nbsp;version nearly solves a problem that&#39;s plagued every minifig scale Falcon since the pie scheme was introduced in 2004. The roof opens into 6&nbsp;sections (4 pieces, the back centre, and the front slanted bit) and there are less obvious gaps in the floor the characters would get sucked into space from. There&#39;s ample space for play everywhere but the cockpit, including a little kitchen the movies would never show.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ramp is wide enough for a minifigure (still not high enough though) and snaps in place nicely. The other side is no longer an escape pod, but there&#39;s a&nbsp;portion in the back that can serve as such, and also serve as a hatch for Rey or Han to do repairs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Speaking of whom... For $160 I would&#39;ve hoped for 16 minifigures or at least 8. There&#39;s 7, including D-O who&#39;s a single static piece, and Boolio, a side character who dies after one scene. Both are shaped very nicely though. To get half the original trilogy&#39;s main cast in Chewie, R2, 3PO, and Lando, all in one set, to finally see Lando in a Falcon set(was he in the Solo version?),&nbsp;and to get Lando at all, is wonderful! Finn&#39;s here too, the most perplexing of the main sequel trio to add, but oh well. He has a little Indiana Jones bag I couldn&#39;t quite get to snap in place for some reason. As previously mentioned I would&#39;ve hoped for at least Rey or Han, if not 8 more, but $160 for 7 minifigs is underwhelming, but I was planning to sell at least some of these as I prefer the classic versions from the old video games.</p>

<p>Overall I don&#39;t regret spending $160 for the newest version of the most important ship of the saga, but the price is&nbsp;really really pushing it. If memory serves it&#39;s a few studs wider than my previous falcon, and inflation is a thing, but I don&#39;t see $60 more worth in here especially when the inside is so much emptier. But since this is the most current, and past versions likely sell for exorbitant rates, this is probably the best you can do at the moment if you can even still find it anywhere.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hope to see better minifig selection, less dark grey, and more innovation on closing the gaps in the next version!</p>

"npapag","2022-05-10T16:45:52.113Z","A decent upgrade","<p>The 75257 is another successful upgrade over the previous Millennium Falcons. It has much more detail than previous designs and more accurate proportions. Plus, great exterior detail, although the 75105 was a bit more complicated. This model is more robust than its predecessors and the figures are wonderful. I would recommend this version of the Millennium Falcon to those who have missed the previous ones (I haven&#39;t !). It is particularly suitable for play, as there is an extensive indoor space. If you find it at EUR150-160 (discounted), it&#39;s perfect, because the original EUR199 is rather stingy. However, LEGO Star Wars fans will enjoy this set.</p>
