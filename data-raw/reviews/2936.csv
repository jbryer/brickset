This have a piece that looks like with an old motor in the little car, that don't loks like be old or new because isn't completed. It have a box piece to carry itens, some itens included with another small set with the same minifigure. The wheels are under the plates that keeps the set, and don't have doors on it. Itens that can be putted in this are some, like a shotgun, a pade, a binocular and many, like in the microcopter set, but aren't all these in this set. The minifigure wears also a hat, and is an iten too. The playability is makes the minifigures it with the control piece, and it run well with the wheels. This set, altough small with few pieces, can be useful with the pieces included on it, with the itens or with the minifigure. In comparision with the sets of this size, this i rate 4/5.

The car is very easy to build and it's very sturdy. You also won't have to complain about stickers. This set also incldes a comic book. The car looks really cool and you get a shovel and a pickaxe with this vehicle. This set also comes with another Dr. Kilroy minifig. This set is a good impulse set to have but I would recommend you to get the other LEGO Adventurers sets first before you get this one.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 2 bricks : It is not really building but mounting a minifigure and a 7 part car. Two bricks is more than enough.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 3 bricks : A good minifigure, Dr. Kilroy,&nbsp;and some nice accesoires like the box and the tools make me give 3 bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 3 bricks : simply because a kid always can play with a car with minifigure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 3 bricks : Average asked price on Bricklink is â‚¬3,25 which is ok for a ""car"" with minifigure. For an Adventurers&nbsp;collector nice to own, for others not a must have.</p>
