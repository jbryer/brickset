"Novelty","2007-05-05T14:55:11.293Z","Jurassic Cage","This is a small set and besides the monocle minifig with the net and the tiny baby dinosaur, there's the cage... without a roof.  There's not much building involved, but the cage is solidly built and it doesn't look too bad.  On its own, this set has some play value.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"protocal_prototype","2007-06-04T19:05:26.14Z","Set","Although this wasn't a great set piecewise, it did contain a dino baby which now I have five of. The thing I liked most was the comic that was included in the box along with the other Adventurer sets (At least the ones I have). I got this when I was little for 10 USD and it is a great set.

"Blade","2007-08-30T11:49:14.24Z","Best to Catch 'em Young","I actually remember buying this set as a kid and i mainly bought it for the baby dino, which at the time was very needed for my collection of animals. For a small set it has some nice pieces including baby dino big net grates and an old school hook hand. The model itself is a real no brainer but for like $3 AU what do you expect and is very solid and aesthetically pleasing.

The model also came with a comic which was quite good actually. All of the adventure series did and most fitted together to make a nice little story. I have the other three models that are this ones partners and I have built the plane which is quite good so the combined price of all four make a good model and give you some extras, it really depends on what you want in your collection.

Overall the model is basic but good and gets a solid 5/10. A good addition for any collector or lover of the adventure series or just a nice one to have.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"motje","2007-08-14T13:25:59.537Z","On it's own this set is boring","You really need the other three sets, but better you'd buy another set in this category which has a greater playability. 
Pros:
* A lovely mini-dino
* A yellow net
* One detailed mini-figure.
Cons:
* Too small

If you have collected all four sets you have the possibility to build a plane for all four people. Furthermore, each set contains a comic.

"Gus_263","2008-04-05T15:16:15.577Z","Sam Sinister, a baby tyrano and a small prision","This set consists in it, the Sam Sinister's minifigure, the baby tyrano and a small prision made with a plate and little ones with rails on two sides. Sam Sinister also carries itens to put the baby tyrano in the jail, and don't have the left hand, but a hook. This set, altough small, still useful also with the simple pieces, in the common gray color. This set is from the adventurers theme and of the Dino Island subtheme, one of four small limited released. It isn't a vehicle, but a building, and is easy keep it on feet don't dismonting. The playability is basically use the itens, the minifigure and the don't playable but well made baby tyrano, playing with the jail. It is due to the contents of the set, but if with more sets, great or small, these can be useful.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-21T11:34:46.197Z","LEGO Adventurers (Dino Island) - Sam Sininster and Baby T Review","This set doesn't have any play features but it comes with a rare piece. The rare piece is a dip net which I've only seen in this set. The set is really easy to built and the built is very quick. It doesn't have any stickers. This set also comes with a comic, a baby t-rex and a jail for the dinosaur. The dinosaur fits in this dip net very easily and you can also put him into the jail. This set is a good set to have but I would recommend you to get the bigger sets of the LEGO Adventurers theme first before you get this set.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
