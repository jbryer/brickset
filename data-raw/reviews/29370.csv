But it's Still Great.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part:</b> The LEGO Movie started an entire movement when it comes to LEGO. This sequel was, at first, admittedly disappointing. The more I have watched it however, the more I understand what the directors and creative team behind the film were attempting. It isn&rsquo;t a terrible film, it is however not as good as the original in my personal opinion because the huge twist that surprised us all from the first film is already known. Which makes topping that twist extremely difficult.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Presentation</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The packaging and menus of this film are all very well designed and work well at showcasing the main characters of the film. This copy includes Emmet&rsquo;s &lsquo;Piece&rsquo; Offering as a bonus Polybag and includes the Blu-Ray and DVD. The picture is highly crisp and very good sound levels. The only thing which might detract folks is the thickness of the packaging making it take up relatively high real-estate on a DVD/Blu-Ray shelf.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Contents</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The movie itself is very well done, and the storyline was an interesting choice. It is nice to see more of LEGO explored including Duplo, Mini-Dolls and Playing with your siblings when exploring LEGO adventures. Included in this package is several short features and fun little deleted scenes, plus an entire commentary from the creative team. Overall pretty decent bonus material on top of the film, whose run time is 107 minutes.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Warner Brothers and LEGO&rsquo;s fourth theatrical offering is a fairly decent film, it engages and tells a decent story which showcases more fun sets and introduces an entirely new world of LEGO Characters in the Sys-Tar System. The biggest issues with the film is that it is the fourth film made by LEGO and WB, which means that the novelty may be starting to wear off. The LEGO Movie 2 seems to have done even worse than The LEGO Ninjago Movie at retail for the physical sets, but the film itself seems to have been well received. If a bit mixed.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I would still recommend picking it up, and this version offers a nice if plentiful Polybag to add to your collection while watching the movie. It inspires everyone to build and play along while watching, and the extra material offers up a few more hours of fun entertainment to enjoy. Recommended.</p>
