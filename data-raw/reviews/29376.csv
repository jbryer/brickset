<p><b>Opening Thoughts</b></p>

<p>I&#39;d like to start this off by saying that I was&nbsp;<em>very&nbsp;</em>excited for this set when it was revealed. It showed up months after Endgame, which gave us a chance for more accurate Avengers: Endgame sets. I was rather pleased with the set when I got it, but upon reflection, it&#39;s not as good as I once thought.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience + Model</strong></p>

<p>The construction of this set was nothing notable, although I did enjoy building the Chitauri ships.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The model as a whole is quite boring. The same Avengers color scheme is re-used here, which works well enough, but makes the helicopter seem quite boring when placed next to something more vibrant. The main feature here, of course, is the Hulk drop (I love being able to recreate this&nbsp;<em>iconic</em>&nbsp;scene). It works well enough, but it&#39;s basically the only play feature here (besides some cannons on the helicopter and the Chitauri flyer). To me, it just isn&#39;t enough to make this set worthwhile. Everything else on the helicopter is pretty standard, and no other deviations are taken from a traditional LEGO chopper.</p>

<p>The two Chitauri vehicles surprisingly end up being my favorite parts of this set. Their color scheme is incredibly interesting, featuring dark tan, gold, and&nbsp;<em>purple</em>! The flyer is cute and subtle, and the Leviathan, while downsized, is still a satisfactory&nbsp;build.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Possibly the biggest attraction for this set is the minifigures. They&#39;re all just fine, but they&#39;re not enough, in my opinion, to justify buying this set at its full price, as I did.</p>

<p>Black Widow is just plain, you could put some random torso and legs on her, and you&#39;d think she&#39;s just a white woman with a ponytail (also, she&#39;s dead by the time that the nano-gauntlet is made, so that&#39;s nice)</p>

<p>Hulk is in his Quantum Realm suit here, and while it does complete the Quantum Avengers, I just wish we had been given the Professor Hulk outfit. He comes with the nano-gauntlet, which has to be my favorite thing in this set.</p>

<p>Pepper Potts is here as well, surprisingly so. She comes in her Rescue outfit from the final battle of the film. I have no comments on her, as she&#39;s essentially a perfect figure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Chitauri are present, but they&#39;re just some generic army-building figures. They&#39;re a bit too cartoony for my taste, but it makes sense why they&#39;re here.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>For $60, I don&#39;t really think we get enough here. I get that the Hulk bigfig adds quite a bit to the price, but don&#39;t you think we could&#39;ve got something a&nbsp;<em>bit</em>&nbsp;more substantial? The play value is quite low, even with the Hulk drop feature. Display value is abismal, as I commented earlier. All in all, the value is less than moderate for a set of this size.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Completes the Quantum Realm Avengers</li>
	<li>Nano-gauntlet and 4 Infinity stones included</li>
	<li>Good Chitauri builds</li>
	<li>Superb Rescue figure</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Insufficient value</li>
	<li>Generic build</li>
	<li>Boring Black Widow figure</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>In conclusion, I&#39;m glad we got this set, although it was a little disappointing. I would recommend you order Hulk, the nano-gauntlet, and Pepper separately. I wouldn&#39;t suggest you buy this set at full price. If you can get 10 or more dollars off, I&#39;d say go for it.&nbsp;</p>
