"Struhadlo","2020-03-24T16:52:40.16Z","Nicely detailed nostalgia trip.. but little underwhelming","<p>I am honestly blown away by the fact that this has never ever been done by Lego as an actual set. We did occasional get a Tatooine&nbsp;set now and then. Usually Mos Eisley&nbsp;cantinas and the most of them were pretty, well underwhelming. So this is an OG set. Sounds funny when you think about it. In 2020 we get an OG set for the original trilogy.</p>

<p>Lego has a long history of making underwhelming Lego Star Wars buildings sets. And honestly I cannot blame them in the most of those cases. Translating an actual structure into a Lego set is a pretty challenging objective. There is so much you have to leave out due to budget and building restrictions. But in some cases they could have tried&nbsp;little harder and I feel like this is the case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set is supposed to be paired with <strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75271-1/Luke-Skywalker-s-Landspeeder"" target=""_blank"">75271</a>&nbsp;</strong>I feel like. But that does not make too much sense since the speeder is actually bigger than the hut. But they still do come together pretty nicely and even though you get two Skywalkers that way, I would still recommend getting both of these sets unless you are happy with whatever previous iteration of the Landspeeder you already own.</p>

<p><strong>PRICE</strong></p>

<p>I do not think this to be a nicely priced set. 30$ for 200 pieces is not the best deal and one can only wonder where do they get the audacity to release such bargains as <strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75272-1/Sith-TIE-Fighter"" target=""_blank"">75272</a>.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>But bear with me here. In this case the pricing is not as blatantly trying to ruin your day as in the previously mentioned case. The hut actually comes with a bunch of nice pieces and the detailing is really gorgeous. But I will get to that later.</p>

<p>So is the set worth its price? Well, yes but actually no. If you get it on a&nbsp;discount go for it! It is still a decent set. If this is a must-have set for you, do not let&nbsp;30$ stand in your way. I think 25$ would be a better deal and even then it could use one more minifig. I think that a solution should be addressed at the point where the issue is mentioned. So given that we keep the price I think the set should have one more Tusken raider and be slightly bigger or just be little more than slightly bigger. Perhaps 2 studs in each dimension excluding the height would help. But then the placement of the sphere piece would come off as&nbsp;awkward. To solve that I would make the hut 4 studs wider towards one side only. Then it would look more like the real thing and the price would not be brought up as much.</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Obi-wan. There is not too much going on with this guy here. He has some really pretty torso and back print. No legs or arms print whatsoever and has one very well-done face print. There is no alternative face in here. The hair piece is not the same hair piece used for a really long time by Lego now as the box art might mislead you. It is similar but it has some shaping done. Ben comes with a lightsaber here.</li>
	<li>Luke Skywalker. The same minifig as in&nbsp;<strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75271-1/Luke-Skywalker-s-Landspeeder"" target=""_blank"">75271</a>.&nbsp;</strong>This is arguably the best Tatooine Luke we have right now. The print is clean and neat. There is no arm printing but that is not necessary I feel like and the hair piece does look somewhat realistic. The colour is too bright, but if you can get over that I think you will be happy with this minifig. Also, Luke comes with two facial expressions and a lightsaber here.</li>
	<li>RD-D2. A classic R2 with a good enough print.</li>
	<li>Tusken Raider. A highlight of this set for me. The guy has a state of the art head mold with spikes, goggles and a detailed mouth. The troublemaker of the set has a nice print on the torso, the back and the legs. I belive this is a reused print from earlier sets but it holds on perfectly. The raider also comes with a gaffi stick.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>As I have already mentioned the set could use a little higher piece count. But from now on I will review just what has been given to us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hut comes with a stellar level of detailing. When you open the thing up, and yes it can be closed and it works perfectly fine in a closed position, you are greeted by an extremely well-done detailing. There is a whole kitchen on the back side with a pot with a stew and a burner underneath of it. In front of the kitchen part is a living room of sorts with three seats and a little table with the legendary blue milk. There is a whole lot of other stuff but you can see that for yourself. What I would love to pin point is the training droid. It is not the part of the scene but it makes for an excellent inclusion. And then there is a new mold for the Leia hologram which looks perfectly recognizable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If this sounds like that is a lot of stuff for such a&nbsp;small building. That is the point of my criticism. The building just screams in a dire need of more room. There is a whole box meant for the lightsabers and/or the training droid and it is placed in the entrance door of the whole hut.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building experience is fun as you take a nostalgia trip and see this lovable building raise up. I recommend you playing some original Star Wars movie music while building this one. If you love the original trilogy you will have a blast.</p>

<p>BTW the half-sphere is pretty rad. Haha.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>There is basically none in here. Thankfully there are no stud shooters and unnecessary rocket launchers crammed into the build. But you can reenact this scene which is pretty cool. I would think of this as more of a display set but you can play with it too. There are just no play features.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>I would not call this set overpriced as its amount of detail and special pieces kind of make up for that. But I would still say this needs to be a little bigger even if it meant the price going a little up. The minifigs are nice and when you close the hut it looks clean and ready to be displayed as a small cute build on a shelf.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the end I would recommend buying this set even for the retail price.</p>

"TBillz","2020-05-28T16:16:06.647Z","""He's kind of a strange old hermit""","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Introduction</b> &ndash; As a Star Wars fan I always consider every single set that comes out each year. When I saw this set I was stoked to see something new out of the line. Obi-Wan&rsquo;s hut in itself is something we&rsquo;ve never received so I bought it, built it, and now I&rsquo;ll review it!</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Minifigures</b> &ndash; 9/10 First off you get another R2-D2 which will fit perfectly in your R2-D2 army that I&rsquo;m sure you have amassed already! The Tusken Raider body print is new for this year which a little variation goes a long way when you have several of the same figures. And variation to Obi-Wan is nice as well. He&rsquo;s a figure that has a huge Lego wardrobe for being an old hermit in the Dune Sea, but I&rsquo;ll definitely take this new version! And finally this Luke is in my opinion is as good as it gets for Lego, so no complaints.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The Build</b> &ndash; 7/10 This is a fairly simple build and I&rsquo;ll speak more to it&rsquo;s size below but it does feel pretty small. The kitchen area seems unfinished and the clips on the bottom of the set make it seem like there is more to come&hellip; or there should have been more? The seating area is iconic and built well here. There are some unique textures implemented in the build but overall this is a fairly easy, straight forward build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Parts</b> &ndash; 9/10 So to anyone who is a Lego Star Wars fan, tan parts are plentiful and this set has a great mix. I love the 2 tan variations included to give it a more authentic look. In the 200 part count, a lot of small parts are included. I think if you put two of these sets together you&rsquo;d be able to make it more of a complete set because in the back kitchen area it just ends sort of abruptly. That is I suppose where your imagination can begin.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Value</b> &ndash; 9/10 Before you look at the part count, and you hold this completed model in your hand, it feels like $20, maybe $25. It is small, but the opening aspect of the hut makes access to the interior very easy. When you close it up it&rsquo;s very satisfying on 3 of the 4 sides. The only imperfection would be the open kitchen side. With a small set like this you do hope for more detail which this set definitely delivers there.&nbsp; There is shelving, a trunk for storage, a stove complete with green-goop-soup, and artifacts along the walls. Oh and the training droid and Leia hologram are incredible elements which pack a punch! Those details, mixed with the 4 minifigures to me make the set worth the $30 retail.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Overall</b> &ndash; 9/10 When I initially finished my build the overall feel was it was very small and the hut itself wasn&rsquo;t worth the original price. Which I think the Hut would be the main draw for everyone to buy this set. It doesn&rsquo;t feel finished on the backside and potentially needs more parts out of your collection to wrap it up. BUT, If you stop and look at the fact you get 4 figures, many interior details, the training droid and the princess Leia hologram you realize how good this set really is. Not to mention that nothing like it has been constructed by Lego before. Honestly if you wanted, you could get a few of these sets to build your own village in Tatooine if you found a discount. Overall I do like the set, and you have to look at everything you get, not just the Hut build itself. If you are a Star Wars fan, you&rsquo;ll appreciate this set and mine looks great next to my Mos Eisley Cantina.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-10-16T07:28:50.603Z","A Fun Little Set","<p>When I saw this set for the first time I knew I had to have it, but that price for such a small set was such a turn off. Well it was on sale for $2 off so I decided I waited long enough, it was time to get it. Is it a good value at $28? Of course not. But is it worth $28? I would say yes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigures&nbsp;</p>

<p>You get 4 minifigures in this set, and depending on how you count you might even get a 5th.</p>

<p>Obiwan of course comes with this set and he looks great. All of my Obiwan minifigures as an old man are over a decade old so this one is of course a huge improvement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Luke also makes sense in this set, and this is an excellent representation of Luke on Tatooine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>R2-D2 is the not the minifigure you are looking for. He is the same old droid that you already own 100 of. I really wish that they would at least print some detailing on his back already! But he of course is necessary as far as the story line for this set goes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A sand person oddly completes the minifigure lineup. Certainly C-3PO would have been more appropriate, but as I already own a handful of him, I&#39;m glad I received the much harder to get sand person and add him to my single file line of sand person minifigures!</p>

<p>&nbsp;The potential 5th minifigure is the Leia hologram, and it in my opinion is the most exciting thing about the set. Obviously it&#39;s tiny and lacks detail, but it looks great and I hope that we ultimately see more hologram figures like this in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Leia hologram aside, this set comes with a decent selection of larger parts which at least somewhat justifies the absurd price tag. The large dome of course would be very useful for building any structure on Tatooine, as would the half cylinder. Besides those two parts there really isn&#39;t anything else too much out of the ordinary.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Build&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set features a relatively simple build, but is loaded with subtle variations meaning that it isn&#39;t repetitive at all. It is just a bunch of simple stacking, but it is fun nonetheless. I really don&#39;t expect to learn any new techniques from a set of this size.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Model&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the model is small, it is very satisfying. When opened up it gives you an adequate amount of space to play, although you will probably have minifigures sitting outside of the house, especially if you bring 3PO along. But the house is jam packed with everything you need and your realtor will be very pleased with all the storage built into such a small house. You get a table with a glass mug and a carton of blue milk. Another platform on which R2 projects Leia. A small kitchen with some green soup cooking in the pot. And two storage compartments, with the larger one holding Anakin&#39;s lightsaber (with the blade detached) and the training droid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When closed up the house looks very nice on 3 of the 4 sides and will be a great addition to your Tatooine scene. Unfortunately the side with the kitchen looks unfinished from the outside. While I agree with keeping the wall open, the white colored bricks are the unused clips just seem out of place.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>This set is way too expensive for what it is, but is $10 really going to change your life any? If this is something that want I suggest getting it while you can. I suppose there is a chance we may see this home again when the new Obiwan show comes out on Disney+, but seeing how it took Lego 21 years to make this set, I wouldn&#39;t want to take my chances. Plus you get 3 excellent minifigures and the Leia hologram, and those alone are very worthwhile to add to your collection. I&#39;m very happy I have this set, now I just need to hope that Lego will one day give us Luke&#39;s home.&nbsp;</p>

"TheBrickDudeStudios","2020-07-15T16:27:00.63Z","Good set","<h2>Builds</h2>

<p>This set comes with only one set and it is Obi-Wan&#39;s hut.</p>

<h3>Obi-Wan&#39;s hut</h3>

<p>You can open the left, right and the top so you can see the inside. The inside of the hut is pretty small but it is just big enough to put minifigs in. Near the door there is a container and in it there is a lightsaber and the training droid. Next to that there is a table with blue milk and a mug. On the left of that there is a little table with princess Leia&#39;s hologram on it. Behind that there is a little stove that has some soup of something on it and it has some fire coming out of it. next to that there is a little shelf with a skeleton leg and a stud with a whole. You can take the stud with a hole and attach it to a clear piece and put the training droid on top. The outside of the hut is not that detailed. It has some buttons near the door, a container with nothing in it and a pipe coming out of the hut.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>There are 4 minifigs that come in this set, they are Luke, Obi-Wan, R2-D2 and the Tusken raider.</p>

<h3>Luke</h3>

<p>Luke comes with a good Luke hair, a face with an expression that is happy face and a slightly angry&nbsp;face. He has a Tatooine body and legs.</p>

<h3>Obi-Wan</h3>

<p>Obi wan has The classic smooth hair. He has a face with a happy expression and no alternate expression. He has a body with a good print in my opinion for Obi-Wan. He has plain light tan legs witch is fine but not the best.</p>

<h3>R2-D2</h3>

<p>R2-D2 has the normal R2-D2 head print. The head print I got is a little wonky but almost every R2-D2 head is like that. He has a regular body print for him and plain white astoromech legs.</p>

<h3>Tusken raider</h3>

<p>The Tusken raider has the newer head piece instead of the regular head piece.&nbsp;He has a body print that is&nbsp;deferent than another version of a Tusken raider.</p>

<h2>My opinions</h2>

<p>I like this set and it has a good minifig selection. I like the new princess Leia hologram mold and the new training&nbsp;droid print.</p>

It&#39;s not even in the dollhouse style that lego usually does buildings: the kitchen build just sticks out the back very obviously.</p>
