With this car, you can go anywhere anytime (because it can fit in your pocket!) Although it isn't my totally most favorite set, it is in my top 10! If you want an adventure, this is the place to stop. And as the man says, good luck finding it!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-12T20:08:12Z","Great 1920's looking jeep!","     One thing I love about the Adventurers series is the authentic 1930's look. They have the old timey grills and the bi-planes, it really is a good line of sets! I like the Johnny Thunder guy here and the load of tools and gear he has, although it will most likely fall out when you drive the car. The car has the cool little Adventurers cabin bottom and the neat scorpions. It looks like the cars from the 20s and 30s so you can really pretend that it is in that time period. It is a nice set and is a good one to have, if you can find it now, they are getting ancient!

"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-12T04:27:16.013Z","Simple but beautiful","This is really a remarkable set: despite being no larger than the average Lego car, it manages to be both in scale to it's minifig *and* have two front seats. This is done by using a single large part for the midsection of the car; in fact, apart from the chassis, there isn't much building to be done for this set. Good thing or bad thing? Well, I certainly think the design choice pays off.

The car itself look great, with a neat &quot;Indiana Jones meets The Mummy&quot; mid-thirties styling. The set comes with an great minifig, two scorpions and all the accessories you'd expect. One of the best Adventurers sets in my opinion.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Rubberducky","2006-07-01T11:55:47Z","This set is cool even though it is small. ","the car is good and you can play with it on its own or you can put it with other sets that have cars to make a convoy, it looks good on my conseratory floor anyway. Also you could use this set for pieses. as it includes: wheels, seats, tools, weapons, a creat, and a minifig.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sabpol","2007-12-14T21:48:35.857Z","Stylish!","Both the vehicle and minifig are stylin' in this set.  I like the 1920's style grille-and-headlights brick and the spoked wheel covers.  The hubcaps remind of those found on LEGO cars produced in the early 1970's, except those were red and on a different kind of axle.  The minifig is wearing a detailed outfit with a red bandana and a unique hat.  

There's also a map, a shovel, and a pick axe.  And the car seats 2 minifigs comfortably, a rarity in 4-stud wide cars.  I wish I had bought more that just one of this set!  I think I paid only $3.99 USD for it when these came out years ago.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-11-24T20:22:08.293Z","Equipment Galore","Well as you can see allot of people think highly of this set and I am no different. Just the general shape of this vehicle makes it so different to most other LEGO cars. It is of very simple design, having one large piece for the body and a buildable drive line. The tire design and grill are very suited to the shape and era of the model. The back has room for a crate which is just full of accessories including a shovel, a pick, a shotgun, a pair of binoculars and two scorpions.

The coolest part of the model has to be the cab of the car itself. It has two seats, gauges and a gear stick, which is quite rare in a car. The other cool bit is the map has a hidden slot between the two seats and it's not that noticeable. Also the windscreen folds down. If you look at the end of the instructions you can see a picture of a smaller car also buildable from this set. Perfect for rebuilding a wreck.

The mini-fig is indeed Johnny Thunder in the usual black pants, brown hat and explorers shirt. I feel LEGO really did a good job designing him as he so suits the part down to the very last detail. The set could of had some sort of real opposition for him and the car but that can be found in most of the other adventure sets.

Overall for such a cheap small model this one really came through with great aesthetics reasonable playability and heaps of accessories. I fell this model is well deserving of an 8/10. A must have for any collection so eBay or Bricklink should be your next stop.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2008-02-11T02:30:32.293Z","One of the best set under $6.00 ever made.","I first go into collecting when this Adventurers theme was on the shelfs. Like all the accesories the mini figure (Johnny Adventure) and the looks and build of the car. You can sit two mini-figs in a car that is really 4 studs wide. I do have a lot of Adventurer sets Desert/Jungle/Dino Island. This simple little set, really pushed me into the world of collecting LEGO's.  Great Car!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Da_LegoBuilder","2007-12-15T17:43:10.467Z","oh, my gosh!","This was one fo the legos that i owned a long time ago. This comes with 2 scorpions, 1 mini, pic axe, vechilce, and gun. this is awesome, a lot of pieces for a low [price! I think this is pretty good, with the detail going into this peice.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"rabk295","2008-07-18T13:33:33.53Z","Pretty nice","This  is a pretty cool little car that would go well with other desert sets, but since I don' have any other desert sets, I don't really have anything to do with this set, but I still think it's a cool set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MasterBuilder","2009-01-04T12:20:23Z","Tracking Scorpions?","This was my first ever set and it had everything: car, trunk for gear, gun, 2 scorpions, pickaxe, shovel, console+windshield, binoculars, and even the rare map with the pointed head things.

Pros: Lots of accesories.

Cons: Bad title name. Why would you want to 'track scorpions'?
          No licsense plate which was a major feature for the Adventurers...then again, because he was in the desert maybe he didn't have to get it registered?",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BasiltheBatlord","2009-08-13T17:45:00.107Z","Johny's Car!","This was one of my first lego sets. It is Johny Thunder's personal car for the desert theme. It has Johny of course, as well as two scorpions, for a desert feel. The car is small but amazing. there is a steering wheel and a lever, a slot for the map, a one stud place on the seats for his binoculars, and an area in the back for his pickaxe, shovel, and rifle.

"The_Stig2","2010-07-09T06:08:23.913Z","Tiny set but great fun","This is the first Adventurers set I got in 1998. Given my love for cars and for ancient Egypt at the time, I had my parents buy me the Scorpion Tracker the first time I saw it on the shelves. What you get for little money is a small 30's-like car with a spacious and very detailed cockpit: inside there are two seats, some dials, a wheel (obviously) and even a gear lever! The downsides are that the car doesn't have headlights nor a reg plate (as most cars of the Adventurers theme had). As an addition you get a cool minifig, two scorpions and quite a lot of accessories, including Anubi's map and binoculars. Great fun is guaranteed!<br>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"AETerry","2010-11-19T00:09:52.3Z","Scorpian Tracker Review","<p>This is a decent little set that's part of the Adventurers theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main model is that of a car and one of the first cars I've noted as being able to seat two minifigures side by side instead of just one minifigure being able to sit in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a minifigure of Johny Thunder, at the time, Lego's answer to Indiana Jones. And a plethora of little accessories such as a map, scorpions, rifle, binoculars, shovel and pick axe. Worth every penny picking this set up.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,5

My beginning journey into the lego universe. My sister helped me build it, but after that I built everything myself. This set at the time was a really good one. It was simple to build, the detail of Johnny Thunder was cool looking, and the pieces held very strong. Looking at it in my showcase makes me reminisce of great times.&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-01T09:45:27.17Z","LEGO Adventurers (Desert) - Scorpion Tracker Review","I don't remember that exactly but this set is my first LEGO Adventurers set I've got. It has no play features but it comes with some useful tools like a shovel, a rifle, a binoculars, a pickaxe and a nice looking map. We also get two scorpions and another Johnny Thunder minifig. The built of that car is easy and the set is very sturdy as well. The vehicle comes with a box on the back which is supposed to be the trunk, a sviwel windscreen, a grill on the front with some headlights and a big cockpit. The cockpit is so big that you can put in two minifigs if you want and there's also a place where you can hide the map. It's a cool car to have and I can't realy complain about it.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Terzeus","2010-12-03T17:49:27.8Z","Scorpion Tracker","The greatest fail of this set is that you have almolst an every part in this set in another Adventurers set. Of course, there are some parts that you cannot get in another set (or they have different colours) but it does not changing anything in my point of view. Johny Thunder is exactly the same, as I remember him (not even a little more difference). There are no new tools and they are not even in another colour!<br><br>But if I look from another side, I see a set that makes a perfect addition to the Adventurers universe. If there was a little bit more enhanced building experience, I would have gave this set a 5/5. But now I have only a very good set, that reminds me of some imperfect diamond. Great playability, great addition, very good car, but there is nothing new and building is not what I expected from this set.<br><br>Pros:<br><ul><li>Another great addition to the Adventurers universe</li><li>Good playability</li><li>Nice car</li></ul><br>Cons:<br><ul><li>There is almost nothing new</li><li>Not very enhanced building experience</li></ul><br>Verdict: This set is not bad.

"Plasmodium","2011-04-27T13:57:42.55Z","Possibly my favorite Lego set...","I got this for what was probably my fourth birthday. While it was not my first Lego set, it was amongst the first, and has remained one of my favourites ever since.<div>While there were plenty of more complex or more detailed but otherwise very similar cars in the other sets, this one was a summary of them all.</div><p>It used several interesting,&nbsp;moulded&nbsp;pieces--the body, the radiator and the crate--and printed pieces (the map, the instrument panel), but they all came together to form a compact and good-looking car. The tools and scorpion set the scene quite nicely, I thought.</p><p>The only complaints I really have are the headlights: it doesn't have any? Was this just Lego saving on pieces to cut down the price, just an oversight, or was it on purpose?</p><div>This is still one of my favourite smaller Lego sets, and though I've added headlights and a few other pieces, it looks the part on a late colonial-era street in my Lego town!</div>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T23:23:13.58Z","SHHHH, be vewry, vewry quiet, I'm tracking Scorpions.","<p>Set #5918 Scorpion Tracker: In 1997 there came another new theme for the LEGO group. That theme was Adventurers, featuring Johnny Thunder, Sam Sinister, Dr. Killroy? and others the theme took us from the wonders of ancient Egypt to the dangers of the Amazon Rain Forest and even into a lost world of prehistoric monsters.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Being a fan of LEGO I was hoping to collect my fair share of Adventurers sets right alongside many others, but in the 90's I was in my late teens and so collected in fits and spurts, with whole years going by where I wouldn't buy anything and then suddenly be bitten by the bug again and start amassing the wonders of LEGO.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This makes for a very nice addition to any LEGO Collection, I've had it since it first came out and though I have to improvise in its construction using replacement pieces such as a white steering wheel in place of the grey one I still can't get enough of this little set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is basically a 1930's era automobile, add it to any LEGO City display and you're instantly transported back in time. The Mini-Figure of Johnny Thunder has been given out more times than I can count on one hand, but he's still an interesting and early attempt at a LEGO version of Indiana Jones. His hat looks more like a Safari style hat then Doctor Jones' though and he sports a very stylish looking mustache.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set also includes digging implements, a map to the Pharaoh's tomb, a rifle and two dangerous black scorpions. It may even be possible to add headlights to the vehicle with a few spare clear studs, they'd even look like old-timey headlights too, I haven't tried it yet. Johnny also comes with black binoculars so there's a nifty accessory to have. (And this was when the binocular piece was new, nowadays it's a tad more common.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite being a simple build I find the construction to be quite satisfying, it's a far cry different from building the more modern vehicles of the LEGO City theme and it includes a molded piece that I find fascinating, from an aesthetic standpoint it looks unique in my limited collection/display.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And this set is definitely fun, if you're looking to build up some old time cars for your LEGO City display or LEGO Automotive display then you can't go wrong with the Scorpion Tracker, just watch out for the Scorpions, even if they are big they can still be dangerous.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
