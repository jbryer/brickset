Surprisingly, I&rsquo;ve never owned a Landspeeder set before so I picked this one up and I&rsquo;m pleasantly satisfied with it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>MINIFIGURES:</p>

<p>Luke - It&rsquo;s a standard Luke on Tatooine figure, nothing too exciting or to write home about, but there&rsquo;s not really any difference they could add here and they have included some form of cape, I&rsquo;m not really sort what the word is to describe it, which is appreciated to change it up a bit.</p>

<p>C-3P0 - Yeah, it&rsquo;s a threepio. It&rsquo;s fine.</p>

<p>Jawa - Now, this is nice because as far as I&rsquo;m aware, the only way to get a Jawa is in the Sandcrawler sets which are both old (and therefore hard to get a hold of) and expensive. So a cheaper way of getting one is pretty nice. I&rsquo;ll take it. The Jawa also has a small cave to where to store its gun, I suppose helps to&nbsp;add to the Tatooine landscape.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I also think, however, that may be we could&rsquo;ve gotten a Obi-Wan figure here, but if Lego swapped him for a Jawa to avoid it being too similar to the previous sets, I guess that&rsquo;s fine.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>THE LANDSPEEDER:</p>

<p>The vehicle itself is a fun little thing that works with any collection really and would work well being used as part of a Tatooine landscape. There&rsquo;s not really too much difference compared to the 2017 model, it&rsquo;s just the grey strip at the front and some slight alterations around the engine area that I noticed were different.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, it&rsquo;s a fun little set and you should get it if you&rsquo;ve not got a Landspeeder yet, but I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend you go out to purchase this if you&rsquo;ve already got one, unless you really want that Jawa. I also feel its UK price could&rsquo;ve been dropped from &pound;25 to &pound;20.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&nbsp;also&nbsp;hope that this is the last Landspeeder set we get in a while, we&rsquo;ve had enough of late to be satisfied.</p>

Look closer though and there are many new details. The use of SNOT at the front allows the arches to protrude half a plate beyond the edge of the nougat plate on top to suggest the curved front. However the price you pay is that the flex tubes that were used previously for the radiator grilles have been replaced with stickers. Another casualty of the SNOT technique is the step on the side of the cockpit to help Luke get into his speeder.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The windscreen is probably the closest match in the existing parts catalogue but still looks nothing like the shape of the real thing. It would have been nice to celebrate the 20th anniversary with a dedicated part. While the poncho looks nice on Luke out of the speeder it doesn&#39;t really working when he&#39;s in the driving seat.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

As mentioned earlier, the engines are different this time and while I liked the new build experience I don&#39;t think they look any better than before. The dark red truncated cones that were introduced three years ago have been used again and while they give a nice profile from the side I don&#39;t like the fact that the jet engines are closed at the front.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

That&#39;s roughly two people head to toe. For minifigs that means 10-11 studs long. The first speeder in 1999 was too long at 15 studs, the last three were 20 and with this one we&#39;re at 22 studs. It&#39;s way too big!</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

"pitcovich","2021-01-06T00:00:07.79Z","Good updated version of Luke's landspeeder","<p>This is yet another version of Luke&#39;s landspeeder that has details very similar to the last version but this one has clear differences.</p>

<p>-Building experience, the build is mostly the same as the last version. The Jawa cave is new and is quite small but can fit a Jawa inside. The build does not have very many interesting pieces but is a good set.</p>

<p>-Minifigs, This build includes 3 minifigs, C-3PO which is no different from the current version. It also includes Luke skywalker with a fabric poncho which comes in no other set, and a Jawa.</p>

<p>-Playability, This set is good to play with but it does not have very many functions. There is a compartment that has macro binoculars in it and a clip that has a blaster rifle on it. The Jawa cave has a clip for the Jawa&#39;s stun rifle.</p>

<p>Overall thoughts. This is a good set and one of the best versions of Luke&#39;s landspeeder so I recommend this because it&#39;s just a good set for the price.&nbsp;</p>
",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
"Struhadlo","2020-03-17T22:29:47.88Z","They will make a UCS of this thing I swear.","<p>Well, it has been a while since Lego has released a new Luke&#39;s Landspeeder right? Three&nbsp;years to be precise. Why does Lego love to make Snowspeeders and Landspeeders so much? Nobody knows. Fortunately they do not just lazily re-release the old models, but they usually find a way to improve over the old ones at least in the case of Luke&#39;s Landspeeder. Snowspeeders are not as lucky in this department I&nbsp;see.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, this new Landspeeder might be the most refined and the best looking one yet to date. But ever since it got revealed, there has been an uproar about it&#39;s pricing. Some people even going as far as calling it&nbsp;egregiously overpriced. The official price stands at 30$ US which is nothing pretty to be honest but it is not a blatant robbery&nbsp;like some other new set I could refer to .. cough .. cough&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75272-1/Sith-TIE-Fighter"" target=""_blank"">75272</a>&nbsp;.. cough. I belive, that the 25$ price mark would look better having the piece count in mind and the amount of stuff we get here. The last one was 20$ but to be fair the new one has much more pieces and ads the little side build to the set. But as would the wise Conan&nbsp;the Barbarian say, &quot;Enough talk!&quot;. At least about the pricing. Also, I am mostly done with meaningless comparisons to the old models as I do not favour them too much.</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Luke Skywalker. We get a classic new Tatooine Luke here with a great looking print. I suppose this is the best we can get, but I hope Lego will prove me wrong in the future. The minifig has both leg print and a torso print. The head has two facial expressions and what I consider to be way too bright blonde hairpiece. What is unique to this set is perhaps the softest Lego fabric I have ever laid my hands on. The poncho is so satisfyingly soft I find myself at the loss for words.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>C-3PO. A stellar looking golden boy with prints all over his body. Nothing special here.</li>
	<li>Jawa. Set also contains a regular Jawa minifig with a classic megaphone gun. The print is nicely detailed on the front and the back of the torso. Legs are left printless. Strangely the hood piece is not the new 2019 one&nbsp;which we have seen in <strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75246-1/Death-Star-Cannon"" target=""_blank"">75246</a>.&nbsp;</strong>As for the megaphone gun. I find the Jawa&nbsp;wee bit clumsy with this weapon in its arms, so I did try if perhaps this would be a time for a stud shooter. I would not.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>The vehicle at question here as I have already mentioned is perhaps the most refined and the best looking one yet. With most attention to detail and with the finest finish. The colour scheme is on point and the design game is on fire! I have to admit that I did enjoy putting on some good old Tatooine&nbsp;soundtrack while building this set. It did bring back the fondest of the fond memories of the times of old when I would pop up a New Hope VHS and get lost in the universe of action and high adventure. Perhaps it is the spirit of the Tatooine section of the pciture which this set captures with an utter perfection.</p>

<p>The set&nbsp;is sturdy and feels great to play with. The only drawback are the stickers which require some care and attention to detail before the application. BE CAREFUL WITH THE FRONTAL STICKERS! Or you will have to put a minifig in front of the vehicle on your display shelf forever. Just like me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The little side build cave thing is honestly just a throw in to justify the price. And it is the weakest part of the set. It helps set the mood for the building experience as it is the very first thing you build. But putting in the Jawa if you wish to make a two-stud connections with both of its legs just feels awkward and takes a wee bit more time than would be necessary if the cave was just&nbsp;little bigger.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>There really is not much playability to this set. The speeder has a little storage behind the cockpit for the poncho and Luke&#39;s scanner. The weaponry of the set also always has a handle somewhere to be held onto.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>In conclusion. What we are presented&nbsp;here with is a slightly pricey but extremely well-designed set which stands second to none in its own landspeeder class. I do not understand the need to produce yet another one of these, but fortunately we got a really nice one this time. I would honestly not be surprised if Lego pulls up a USC model of this vehicle.&nbsp;</p>
",TRUE,4,3,4,2,3
"fanoftechnic","2022-06-24T02:20:08.893Z","A reasonable model of a boring vehicle.","<p>The coolest point about the landspeeder in the movie is that it&#39;s Luke&#39;s first beater car and he has a bunch of adventures driving it, and he sells it to get off that old rock and of course it FLOATS IN THE AIR!</p>

<p>But all this is hard to capture in a static model. There are no moving wings, no turrets, so it&#39;s hard to fault LEGO for a perfectly respectable, affordable, landspeeder&nbsp;model.&nbsp;I feel bad giving it a middling review because it&#39;s a middling vehicle to start with. But there you have it.</p>

<p>Everything we see in the movie is captured here, which is to say, not much. There&#39;s even a little trunk in the back where Luke can store his binocs, which is a nice touch.</p>

<p>I did get annoyed somewhere in the middle of the (fairly short) build, where a lot of detail went into the nose of the speeder, but was then covered up by the top plates.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestions for improvements:</strong></p>

<p>Perhaps they could have made an attempt at some transparent legs to make it look like it&#39;s floating?</p>

<p>Perhaps they could have imagined up something in the nose of the vehicle - an engine or generator or something, and we could have had a landspeeder whose engine hood opens up?</p>
