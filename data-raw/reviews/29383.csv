<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">For a very reasonable price per part you get a huge selection of reddish brown parts including many parts useful for building timber furniture to populate modular buildings etc.&nbsp; You also get a large number of reddish brown window and door frames.&nbsp; My favourite Lego colours are the dark colours, and parts in these colours are often hard to come by.&nbsp; This set provides a great range of earth green and earth blue parts as well as a huge selection of parts in the rare dark brown colour.&nbsp; You also get a life-time supply of green, earth green, yellow and orange foliage.&nbsp; There is also a large number of other interesting parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The four minifigs are adequate but, as I understand it, not new.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The parts are great, but the whole is greater than a collection of its parts.&nbsp; The model is fun to build with lots of interesting techniques and wonderful little details that reveal themselves as you build the model.&nbsp; Only adding the foliage at the end gets repetitive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The completed model is quite beautiful and full of fun little details.&nbsp; It is quite big, and really has a presence on display.&nbsp; It has a &#39;no expense spared&#39; feel about it, with no empty spaces that feel like they were left empty to cut costs.&nbsp; The interior details in the three huts are a particular highlight.&nbsp; There are no stickers.&nbsp; Structurally the model is very robust despite its shape.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">One quibble is that the tree floats on tile hight above the green grass.&nbsp; This could have been corrected by adding a layer of tiles between the grass and the bottom of the trunk.&nbsp; Also, the ability to swap between Summer green and Autumn yellow/orange foliage looks good in photos, but the task of swapping the foliage is tedious in the extreme, and involves breaking down and rebuilding most of the branches.&nbsp; In practice I suspect most people are going to pick one of the colour choices when they first build the model and won&#39;t ever bother to change it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Pros;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Great value.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Useful parts, many in desirable and rare colours.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Mostly a very enjoyable build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Beautiful completed model with many great details.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Cons;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Adding foliage at the end of the build is a bit tedious.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The tree floats above the ground, adding tiles would have fixed this.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Mildly hard to display given its size.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is great value, contains a huge range of great parts, is fun to build, and produces a beautiful model that looks great on display.&nbsp; There are many great details on the set that reward people who explore the completed model.&nbsp; This is one of the best sets of the past few years.&nbsp; If you enjoy building modular buildings or the Ninjago City sets, then I highly recommend the Tree House.</p>
