<p>This a good polybag especially as a promo as I got it but being my only 20th anniversary figure it just looks out of place .</p>

<p>Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure uses the classic make hair piece in light grey , a remake his original face , his classic torso with added anniversary logo back printing , some unprinted legs and he wields a blue bladed lightsaber .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build is very basic and features one printed piece and an extra 2&times;4 black plate to connect to other stands .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>This is a good polybag in its own right but for me when I look at it I feel empty , those anniversary sets were so good and I have no clue why orient get all of them get this if you have them and get this if you want it .&nbsp;</p>

LEGO&nbsp;must of had extra stock because they started selling them for $4 or the equivalent of that in your currency. This significantly brought down their value. But the figure is good, they perfectly captured the old style minifig that they were going for. The base is nice with is name displayed on it, it&#39;s base is also compatible with the other 20th Anniversary figures. This polybag isn&#39;t really made for play which is why I gave it a low playability score. Overall 5/5, it&#39;s a great figure and looks nice with the other 20th Anniversary figs.&nbsp;</p>
