"MisterBrickster","2020-01-17T17:18:58.05Z","A surprising hit","<p>I&#39;m going to be honest - I bought this set for the exclusive Iron Man variant. I expected to build it once for the sake of it and relegate it forever to the parts bin. And boy am I glad I did build it once, because this set is really rather good.</p>

<p>The initial official pictures (and the box art for that matter) make the mech look weird and spindly, and make Iron Man look a bit like he&#39;s stuffed his cheeks full. In person, the figure looks great, the lines are much more subtle than the official photos make it look. The mech is surprisingly satisfying, with decent presence and sturdier limbs than I realised. It&#39;s incredibly poseable to boot. It&#39;s smaller than the Hulkbusters but somehow manages to look surprisingly imposing.</p>

<p>The build is surprisingly complex, with a fair bit of SNOT and not a single wasted brick - it&#39;s economical but aesthetically pleasing, with the bright red blending much better than I expected. Even the back is well finished, without many ugly anti-studs. The sticker sheet is small, but adds nice detail to the shoulders and feet. The arc reactor on the chest is a nice printed design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I expected to put the figure straight in my Hall of Armour and scrap the mech for parts, but honestly I can&#39;t bring myself to do it. Instead, it has pride of place beside my monitor.</p>

<p>And all for &pound;9. Strongly recommended for anyone who&#39;s even a causal fan of Iron Man.</p>

<p>As a small mech, it&#39;s a pretty straightforward build which comes together nicely. Plenty of sideways (SNOT) building and nice to have 3 articulation points for each limb. The colour scheme &mdash; in red, dark red &amp; pearl gold &mdash; works well and suits the character nicely. The greys of the ball (Mixel) joints don&#39;t clash too badly, either.</p>

<p>It&#39;s got a nice selection of parts. There are a few stickers which I didn&#39;t apply and don&#39;t really feel necessary. The key decorated component, the arc reactor on the chest, is a printed piece.</p>

<p>Playability is where this mech really comes into its own. The proportions give it a nice stable base with well proportioned feet, and because the model is quite small, it is also lightweight. This means that the joints are relatively stiff and will hold arms, legs &amp; torso in a wide range of poses. This is where the real fun is for me &mdash; all manner of fun &amp; funny poses can be achieved. The mech balances nicely on its toes, or on one leg, and the arms can be posed in a wide variety of positions. It&#39;s been a lot of fun for the family taking turns to create whacky new positions.</p>

<p>One minor change I made was to swap the assemblies at steps 64 &amp; 81, inverting them and swapping left and right. This creates a more natural knee joint (it won&#39;t now flex forward) and better flexion of the ankle. This really extends the poses possible.</p>

<p>With a nice Iron Man figure, fun play and a decent price this represents good value for money for me.</p>
