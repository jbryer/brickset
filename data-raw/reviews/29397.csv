The three figures are amazing, with Thor being my favorite version of the character so far. I&#39;m also excited to get the AIM agents, and the figure is pretty neat. Black Panther is the best of the three in my opinion though, and looks fantastic. I wasn&#39;t exactly excited about the build for this set, because speeder bikes like this get old, but I was pleasantly surprised by how engaging the build was, and the new parts are quite interesting. I think it was easily worth $20, and is a very well designed set with great figures.</p>

This is the cheaper set of the Theme and includes some fairly impressive characters with a few typical builds of the Theme.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Avengers are in the top left corner in animated LEGO form. (Seriously LEGO why are there no animated Marvel films?) Specifically we have Captain America, Iron Man, Hulk and Captain Marvel.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The set is shown on the front in a battle between The Avengers Bike and the AIM Hover Pack. The back features more of a battle scene with some call-outs to the stud shooters (which use a new type of projectile in this era of Marvel.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There are two numbered manuals in this set for each numbered bag build, a sticker sheet is also included. The QR code is on the first manual, but not the second.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The set features a lot of parts common enough, studs, bricks, plates, wheels, axles, wheel wells, but now we find some new elements, four blades to represent hover craft propellers, a fancy looking anchor hook, some items that resemble grenades, and interesting new connector pieces with two or three bars and studs, these parts are sculpted to resemble engine elements and the like. A very interesting new type of element introduced by LEGO.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Aim Agent: This Minifigure is a common trooper, much like Stormtroopers and others he shares a print that is the same as in other sets with AIM Minifigures. He also shares the same head, head gear and breathing apparatus. I&rsquo;m not sure why, but I have this odd feeling these AIM Agents are trying to tap into super powers, because they are after the strange energy canisters in this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">For accessories he carries two hand-held weapons, an energy blasting gun and a grapple gun with a long chain and hook on it to swipe the canisters the Avengers are trying to protect.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Black Panther: Based more on comic design this Minifigure has a special collar and the same basic double-sided torso print for his armour costume. He has no accessories. Fairly standard look for a non MCU inspired Black Panther.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Thor: This version of Thor is dressed in a dark silver armour, he includes Mjolnir of course and two flick-fire energy blasts. He has a spongy style cape which is softer and more flexible, a light blond hair colour and uses the facial expressions seen on other recent Thor&rsquo;s with the glowing lightning effect around the eyes. A pretty nice Thor.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #1: Black Panther hops to action to construct an Avengers Bike, this model is typical of the large-scale motorcycles built in the LEGO Super Hero theme. This is slightly more substantial than some past offerings, Technic elements are not the only method of construction here, a small number of stickers are used for the detailing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag #2: Thor and the AIM Agent appears to build the Heli-Pack worn by the AIM Agent and the two canisters they are fighting over. These canisters can have anything in them, gamma materials, radioactive waste, unknown super fuel. The Heli-Pack is rather large, one of the largest builds attached to the back of a Minifigure. This build is pretty quick with a few minor sticker applications, possibly only one. Overall a nice selection of builds here and quick to construct and play.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Avengers Speeder Bike: What an unusual name, but since Disney owns both franchises I guess they can allow LEGO to use the term Speeder Bike for a motorcycle instead of an Imperial Scout Repulsor Craft.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with most large scale bikes in the Super Heroes range this technic skeleton build features large wheels. There&rsquo;s some nice tech details using some wheel wells from Speed Champions if I&rsquo;m not mistaken. Unlike some of the previous models in this size range the &lsquo;cockpit&rsquo; allows for a Minifigure to sit quite snugly and look like they are actually driving things. There are two stud launchers on either side loaded with new grenade projectiles using studs and other elements in the build. This is a fairly goofy scale for models like this, since it is in no way accurate to scale for what a Minifigures would ever drive. But it works great as a chunky block-built toy for younger fans. As a display piece it&rsquo;s worlds better than some past iterations.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">AIM Flight System: This is a pair of built-up VTOL engines with additional armatures attached to fire stud grenades, hack into safes or other armored protection and all attached via two ball joints to a new back bracket mounted on the Minifigure. I am not 100% certain how they are meant to be controlled though, unless there&rsquo;s some kind of wi-fi hookup or mental link with the AIM Agents who use it. Fairly impressive idea though, love the functionality of it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a pretty nice set, it has a few models, though really there isn&rsquo;t much to see here. Bikes of this size are a problem in LEGO Super Heroes. That being said, I dig this set, it is a vast improvement from past offerings with ridiculously oversized bikes. In point of fact I find this set to be ten times better than the Endgame set of the same price and size class. Why? Because the source material for this set is not an MCU set, but rather, I believe a Video Game or Cartoon if I&rsquo;m not mistaken and these types of things are typical in such media.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Also the overall design and theme of the set is much better executed compared to that other set. The bike here isn&rsquo;t nearly as offensive to me, it reminds me of a Bat-Pod actually. I&rsquo;d recommend this set, I&rsquo;d recommend it over past bike sets. I&rsquo;d also recommend getting this on sale if possible.</p>
