"Isj_rocks","2020-05-12T18:28:33.443Z","The best set of the wave!","<p>I remember first seeing the pictures for the original Endgame sets, they all looked amazing from far away, but the closer you look at them, the more problems you could find. The Captain America motorcycle set was the most tempting to buy, but I already had a large Outrider collection, why would I need any more of them? I held off from the set, but longed for the new helmet and shield Captain America had finally been given. My logic was that some time down the line Lego would make another Mini figure like that. Luckily, I was correct, from the second I saw this set, I knew I&rsquo;d own it in my collection. The trucks compact build was amazing, and the figures coming with it were great too. After I bought the set, I wasn&rsquo;t disappointed. The Captain America figure was great and the torso would be amazing for a purist custom U.S. Agent someday. The power blasts were a bit much though, but they were easily removable. The only other problem with the truck was that when the gun was inside the vehicle there was a hole on the roof. It&rsquo;s understandable why Lego did this, but I do wish they&rsquo;d just put the time into finding a more feasible design. I&rsquo;ve built a Avengers Compound Mac and this fits nicely in the garage. The AIM vehicle is fine too, I&rsquo;d rather there had been more figures though. So overall, it&rsquo;s a pretty good set, and I do enjoy the playability of it, the figures are good, and the builds are decent, and that&rsquo;s my review!</p>

"rypo2020","2020-06-02T03:18:00.88Z","Best set of January 2020 Avengers Wave","<p>This action-packed set pits Steve Rogers and Clint Barton&#39;s armored transport vehicle against the agents of Advanced Idea Mechanics. This appears to be somewhat inspired by the upcoming video game based on&nbsp;the famous superhero team, The Avengers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><em>Captain America&nbsp;</em>is easily the best mini figure in this set. This figure of Steve reflects his appearance in the video game, featuring less flashy red and white stripes and a more armored design. The earth blue legs are completely unprinted however, the torso displays a brand-new print that includes a belt, pockets, the iconic star on his chest, and red and blue stripes in-between two white pockets. Captain Rogers&#39; head is new, featuring a scowling face with a chinstrap to line up with the helmet and a smiling face without the chinstrap to be used with his included hair piece. Cap is equipped with his shield from 2019&#39;s Avengers wave.</p>

<p><em>Hawkeye&nbsp;</em>is a great figure as well, featuring a comic-style outfit. Hawkeye has not yet been seen in the Marvel&#39;s Avengers game trailer, so it is unclear wether this is based on his game appearance or not. Clint has plain black legs and a new torso print with purple wings on the chest area and grey straps on the sides and across the middle. He has plain light nougat arms to match his head color and a black quiver on his back. Hawkeye&#39;s head has his comic purple sunglasses with&nbsp;a smug expression and an&nbsp;angry face on the rear. Barton gets the spiky IW Thor hair. The archer is equipped with his bow and arrow piece.</p>

<p><em>The A. I. M. Agents&nbsp;</em>are in nearly every 2020 Avengers set. They have plain gun-metal legs and armored torsos with yellow arms. The agents heads feature orange visors and gas filters. They have pilot helmets in gun-metal. One agent is equipped with a stud shooter, while the other has a large flamethrower and a jet-pack.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A. I. M. Trike</strong></p>

<p>The A. I. M. Agents get some firepower with their small three-wheeler and its deployable drone. Basically all this does is roll and shoot studs, but it is a nice inclusion, giving The Avengers something to fight.</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Avengers Truck</strong></p>

<p>Captain America and Hawkeye get to drive a large, armored truck with lots of firepower. The truck&#39;s driver has a large windshield and a steering wheel. The front bumper has headlights and a license plate. The sides of the truck display the team&#39;s &quot;A&quot; logo and two weapons on each side.&nbsp;The rear wall has brake lights,&nbsp;rear headlights and a tab sticking out that triggers an action feature. This action feature pushes the two walls apart and reveals a deployable stud cannon.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I thoroughly enjoyed getting this set. The new Avengers mini figures are the highlight, but the truck is really cool as well. The action features on the truck are really fun and it is possible to fit multiple characters in the rear section, so it can serve as a troop transport.&nbsp;The A. I. M. things are nice to have to oppose the heroes. The price of $40 seems incredibly fair.&nbsp;</p>

"Steezy","2021-12-07T04:45:28.33Z","Very underrated set. Neat figures and fun playset.","<p>I found this set for much cheaper than retail on Ebay, I only bought it for&nbsp;the Hawkeye and Captain America figures but ended up loving the set as a whole. The truck is a sizeable build with some neat weapons. I ended up modifying mine to remove the stud shooter that sits in the van, but overall I think this set is worth it.&nbsp; The Cap and Hawkeye figures are exclusive (They&#39;re based off the Avengers game), so I&#39;d recommend you pick them up.&nbsp;The van could become a nice part of any city as well!</p>
