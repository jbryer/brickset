"Bhahouighf","2020-01-19T21:22:35.96Z","As fun as it is funny","<p>I&#39;ve seen Infinity War and Endgame, and I enjoy the MCU&#39;s depiction of Thanos very much; however, I am but a lad, and I have been&nbsp;moulded by&nbsp;the digital era, so I recognize Thanos first and foremost as a bit of a meme. As such, rather than being alienated by a concept as irreverent as&nbsp;<em>Thanos&nbsp;Mech</em>, its inherent hilariousness&nbsp;was enough to pique my curiosity. Thankfully, I am not the least bit disappointed with this purchase, and in fact I found myself compelled to write to you all so that you, too, may share in my delight.</p>

<p><strong>Parts and Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>I like this&nbsp;Thanos minifigure. The use of Vladek&#39;s helmet to stand in for his distinctive helm is probably disappointing to a lot of people, but I am not one of them, because I prefer his look without the helmet and the minifigure designer had the forethought&nbsp;to leave the back of his head unprinted so that he may be displayed sans headgear. I also now have a golden version of Vladek&#39;s helmet to use on whatever I please, so that&#39;s a win for me. The minifigure isn&#39;t anything special in terms of print detail or quality, but it&#39;s special to me because it&#39;s Thanos&nbsp;and I love him.</p>

<p>As far as parts go, the most notable are the large mech chestplate&nbsp;element in gold, which I believe only appears elsewhere in 2018&#39;s Tech Wizard Showdown, the printed shield piece which provides the chest&#39;s detail, and the ten drum-lacquered gold parts, comprising two 1x1&nbsp;tiles, five&nbsp;1x1 cheese slopes, two 2x2 cut-corner tiles, and one 3x3 dish. Make of the parts what you will; I don&#39;t know if any of those are in high demand, but you might!&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>I cannot say that I had very much fun building Thanos Mech. I wouldn&#39;t call it a bad build, but it has many small parts and there are multiple&nbsp;1x1&nbsp;pieces that, if you&#39;re like me, you&#39;ll&nbsp;spend excessive time and effort on aligning. Building and straightening the fingers is also a little tedious, though not terribly so, and I winced a little every time I had&nbsp;to touch one of the drum-lacquered gold parts because I&#39;m horribly afraid of wearing down the finish. Those on the younger side probably won&#39;t be as worried about the fine details as I was, but they may have difficulty with some of the more delicate sections of the building process, so I can&#39;t say I expect anyone to really love building this set.</p>

<p><strong>Play and Display Potential</strong></p>

<p>The mech is nice looking! The sides are gappy, and it obviously doesn&#39;t have accurate human proportions, but it&#39;s a nice looking mech, and it doesn&#39;t take a great stretch of the imagination to see it&nbsp;simply as a large, tiny-headed&nbsp;Thanos. Its many points of articulation make it great for posing, but if play gets too rough, the mech&#39;s&nbsp;joints are likely to be jostled&nbsp;into some unusual positions. It&#39;s also very easy to modify because its construction is so simple; I&#39;ve swapped the large golden chestplate element for a dark blue version, which I think creates a more cohesive look and evokes&nbsp;Thanos&#39;s appearance in Avengers: Infinity War.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The biggest obstacle to play here is that this is only a Thanos Mech. Now, while I&#39;m perfectly content with solo Thanos adventures, some kids may want to make the Thanos&nbsp;Mech fight people, but foes are tragically absent from this set. For solo play with Thanos Mech, I suggest&nbsp;flinging the Infinity Stones off somewhere in a carpeted room and trying to hunt&nbsp;them back down or pretending the Mad Titan is giving a monologue after wiping out all life in the vicinity.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Thanos&nbsp;Mech is not a technical marvel. It doesn&#39;t really stand out from its three counterparts by its own merit, so I imagine purchases will be driven by the popularity of its pilot. This was the case for me, and I am satisfied with the Thanos&nbsp;I have purchased. That is why, although I can&#39;t honestly give Thanos Mech a 5 in all categories, I rate it five stars overall. It&#39;s also worth noting that the Marvel mechs probably have the most Fun Potential&nbsp;out of all the sub-series of $10 knick-knacks LEGO has released this year, as the Friends and Ninjago pods are mostly focused on storage. In conclusion, I recommend Thanos Mech to you and all of your friends!</p>

"Spruce","2021-06-02T21:55:23.39Z","Thanos Mech (I can't say that without laughing), LEGO set 76141","<p><strong>Pre-Release Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>A Thanos mech? But why? These are the questions that were going through my head the moment I heard about this. The absurdity of something like this is what I live for. By the time it released, my curiosity had gotten the best of me and I bought it.</p>

<p><b>Build Experience + Model</b></p>

<p>The build experience was almost surreal. &ldquo;I&#39;m building an armored suit for a purple titan&rdquo; kept going through my head.</p>

<p>Obviously the model was pretty short. I expected that, as it is a $10 set. Even with its small proportions, I feel that this model manages to be everything I could ask for from a mech. The body is connected mainly by using Mixel ball joints. The standout feature here is the Infinity Gauntlet, using a mix of dark tan, drum lacquer&nbsp;gold, and warm gold. The Infinity stones look perfect and still manage to allow for good articulation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cockpit is built using a new piece to hold the minifigure in, but Thanos tends to slip out.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Thanos is here! He looks great for a comic book accurate figure. This minifigure is perfectly fitting for this set and I couldn&#39;t ask for more.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>For $10, this certainly gives you a substantial mech. The play and display value is good&nbsp;here, as well as the price per part ratio and the volume for price value. This also has the additional meme value. A Thanos mech is such a hilariously weird idea that will surely get a laugh out of you once you have it in hand.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This set is an absolute joke. Come on, a Thanes mech? It&#39;s absolutely crazy. However, the set manages to be superb for play. I&#39;d highly recommend it to Marvel fans and general Lego fans.</p>
