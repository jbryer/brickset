Two things really make this an 8.
1. It is too futuristic for the 1920's.
2. Gives off a big square shape.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2007-08-26T21:36:27.49Z","Good looking car.","The car shown here looks alot like an old Ferarri or Maserati. It kind of looks like a 1920s car, but who cares, it such a good looking car. If you are a car geek, you know you should own this set instantly!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2008-02-11T02:35:54.373Z","Dr Sinister on Johnny Adventurer's trail","Cheap affordable set, get a cool car and the main bad guy. Car is different, longer than most and just looks good. Quick easy to build and fits in with the Adventurer theme wherever the action is taking place. Great buy to add to the theme, there was not alot of vehicles produced in the theme so I think its a must have set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-05T10:52:42.7Z","Island Racer","Another car of the adventurers theme, this is of the dino island subtheme. This is a small set, but the car is more longer than other cars like of the desert subtheme. Some pieces have a circular shape, like the parts on the front. The front makes the car looks like be one old car, but the size and the shapes makes this looks like also a hot rod. The minifigure is cool, was included in the firsts sets of the theme and bring back to this, here with a white hat, previously brown in desert sets. The pieces of the car are well designed and good painted, colors like the gray, black and red are compatible in some themes, like ferrari cars, city, and others. It have a plate under, used as a base. The wheels altough are builted above the plate, their size makes it run well. The playability consists in put the minifigure in the car to rides it. Itens are included like a binocular piece and a pistol, to makes a lego scenery to the set. The design, colors, and builting makes this set be useful to ohter sets like the racers and of the adventurers(substituted by indiana jones).    ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2008-06-13T18:31:18.437Z","not sure whats bad","there isnt much so how can there be anything bad? the car is a very good design and  the playability is great. it should have came with a dinosaur and the bottom is bulky. but now you can get it very cheap.

get it if you like adventureres and indiana jones because it will be a great expansion

"asianlego","2008-10-07T03:24:08.39Z","Dino Drift","Baron von Baron roars his jalopy on the island. The vehicle is superbly designed although the base chassis is quite bulky. I like the engine and front grille parts the most. If you didn't already know, this vehicle is available in the PlayStation game 'Lego Island 2: Brickster's Revenge' and you are able to ride it as well. You must get this vehicle if you are a fan of Adventurers because this is better than any other car designed for Adventurers theme.

well detailed

"BasiltheBatlord","2009-08-23T16:22:37.34Z","Baron's Speedster","This car is Baron Von Barron's personal car in Dino Island. the back of the car has a nice shape, and it has a good length, for a quick look. It's a great car for the Baron to go racing around the island, stealing dinosaurs, and of course it incudes him, with a grey flight hat rather than his usual pith helmet, and a pistol",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Atbin7856","2009-05-03T01:52:37.17Z","Sweet!","My aunt got me this set when I was little and I was a happy boy then, here's my review:

Pros:
Comes with Baron Von Baron or Mr.Hates or even Sam sinister.
Extra gun plus some extra pieces.
Great build :)

Cons:
None but mine is in pieces (have the fig to start with and I will rebuild it)
Overall it is great and the instructions aren't long and it appears in lego Island 2 and lego racers 2!

In the 1950's we've seen lot's of Formula 1 cars like this one except they didn't have any headlights in the front. But the details are really similar which means that this set is also a must have for all LEGO collectors who love Formula 1. One things which I think it's annoying about this set: It comes with a revolver. Has anyone seen a Formula 1 driver with a weapon during a race? I haven't. But the set is very nice to play with. If you buy a lot of them you can probably recreate a race scene from the '50s. It's a fun set to play with - even if this model doesn't have any play features. It's sturdy and it doesn't have any stickers as well. And of course this set looks really cool. ;-) <br><br><span><br></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Ideas:</span><br><br>This

"Terzeus","2010-12-04T08:00:42.193Z","Island Racer","I will start this review with a reason why I adore this set so very much. It is actually the third set from my TOP three Dino Island (Adventurers subtheme) sets. Originality and perfection of this set comes from a really cool design that combines nice parts with a perfect use of selected colours. And the final result of building is just amazing. You will get a very good minifigure, perfect car with nice details and you can play with it forever.<br><br>Pros:<br><ul><li>Building is really cool, but short</li><li>Very good designed and detailed car</li><li>You will get some nice parts</li><li>Car is pretty long and big</li></ul><br>Cons:<br><ul><li>You will build it in a two minutes</li></ul><br>Verdict: Super mix of good parts and interesting building that you must have in your collection.
