It&#39;s interesting to see mech style builds in the Marvel line since the not so good buildable figures from 2012. I like seeing small size minifig scale mechs and at a good price too. Sets like these are affordable ways of getting &quot;desirable&quot; minifigs without shelling out lots of money for just one set. I hope to see more if Lego can still have the Marvel licence.</p>

<p>Pros.</p>

<p>A lot of useful pieces.</p>

<p>There&#39;s some good possibility with the mech itself.</p>

<p>There&#39;s lots of articulated parts.</p>

<p>Cons.</p>

<p>The Spider-Man minifig is the same one that has been released in 2 other sets from 2019 and the other ones that are available in other sets released in 2020 have dual moulded legs.</p>

<p>The stickered pieces should&#39;ve been printed.</p>

<p>The ball joint pieces really need to start being printed in other colors, besides light grey.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is a good Marvel set at the price of $10 and I do think you should buy it now at full price.</p>

I&nbsp;suspect how much you enjoy this set depends on who you are.&nbsp; If your the type to enjoy very complex sets stay away.&nbsp; However i would glady gift it to a kid who love both lego and spiderman.&nbsp; It seems to run about $10 online (mine was a gift) which seems about right about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
