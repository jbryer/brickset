The minifig is great, looks like a person that was found on the island...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-18T02:54:18Z","Cool","This is a cool set and the glider is really cool. The propeller at the back is a cool addition to the glider. The vegetaion on the cliff is also cool. It's a bad thing a lost the Pteradon or Pteradactyle (whatever it is) that comes with it. 
Pluses:
* The glider is cool
* The Pteradon or Pteradactyle is also great
* The mountain cliff is great
* The glider wings move up and down to position
Cons:
* Um just one
* The control is a steering wheel, so why does Mike need a propellar if he has no control for the propeller.

Overall get thi set if you collect the dinosaur lego because it is a great way to get all the dinosaurs and Mike for a cheap price. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"omgbrick","2009-03-26T18:40:01.39Z","Featuring a Ptredon Choke chain!","I orginally posted this review on eurobricks but I'm also going to post it on here to all who are interested in this set. 

I still remember when I got this set in 2000. One day my mom came home from shopping and offered me either 5921 Research Glider or  [b][url=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6026-1""]6026 King Leo[/url]  [/b]. Seeing that 5921 had a bigger box I chose it over King Leo, then went straight to building. It's one of the smaller sets in the Dino Island theme, but still fits in well. In case you aren't familiar with the story it goes along the lines that: one day Johnny Thunder and his gang discovered a secret Island that was teeming with dinosaurs (*cough* King Kong *cough*). Since Johnny and his team are scientists, they decide to research the dinosaurs in hopes of learning more about them. 

That brings us to this set Mike, one of Johnny's men has set out in his glider to capture some Pterodons. 5921 includes Mike and his glider and a small tree with a nest for the Pterodon. 

So without further ado I present to you the 8th wonder of the Lego world: ""5921 Research Glider""!

[b]Box[/b]
The box had the same theme that the other Dino Island sets had. I personally like the brown borders and volcano in the background. It just seems very fitting for an Adventurers theme Lego box. However since this set is about 9 years old I no longer have it's original box, so here's Peeron's picture of it:
[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/MacKin/5921-Research-Glider/5921_box.jpg[/img]

[b]Minifigs[/b] 
There is only one minifig in the set, but that's fine for a $6 dollar set, especially considering it also has a tan Pterodon to play with.

[b]Mike[/b]
If you follow the story the minifig's name is Mike. I like his torso decal, it seems that he's still too young to carry a gun and instead wields a slingshot to scare off angry dinos. He also wears a matching brown vest and kepi.

[b]Accessories[/b]
This set only has one or two accessories (depending on how you look at it :wink: ), including a large stick with a chain stuck on the end. I think it's meant to capture the pesky Pterodon although, I think that may be near impossible as it must weigh a ton. The set's second accessory is also it's only spare piece (a 1 by 1 circular plate), which can be used as a ""Pterodon egg"", that Mike might also want to collect.

[b]Pterodon[/b]    
The Dino Island theme is the only theme that included Pterodon's. In this set the 1 piece Pterodon is tan. It's easy to attach stuff to it, since there are two studs on the top of it, and there are 4 on the bottom (inversed studs that is). I for one think it's a fine piece that could see plenty of use in museum or Dinosaur MOCs.

[b]Models[/b]
There are two main models in this set a tree and the glider.  

[b] Tree Overview [/b]
The tree is built on a small rock formation made up of mostly standard 2 by 4's and 2 by 6's, although it's not the prettiest rock design out there at least Lego tried, and besides it never hurts to have a few extra pieces in [b] old[/b] grey. The tree also doesn't look that great, but I do like the leaves and nest they included. 
[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/MacKin/5921-Research-Glider/researc_glider_017trim_1.jpg[/img]

[b] Foliage and Nest [/b]
I've zoomed in on the nest and foliage to give you a better view. It's nice they included a nest, but I think the 2 by 2 round plate should have been printed to make it look less... dull. 
[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/MacKin/5921-Research-Glider/researc_glider_018trim_1.jpg[/img]

[b]Tree Plus Pterodon [/b]
Lastly here's a picture of the pterodon perched on the tree. Am I the only one who thinks the tree is a bit too small compared to the pterodon? Then again I guess that is okay as this was only a $6ish dollar set.

[b]Glider Overview[/b]
Now onto the ""Glider"" as Lego calls it even though it clearly has an engine and propeller on the back. It's a rather simple design that looks okay from the front but the back is way too boxy and bulky for my tastes. The wings are made from two sheets of printed plastic (think overhead projector slide) slipped onto a white lance.
[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/MacKin/5921-Research-Glider/researc_glider_007_1.jpg[/img]

[b]Glider Back[/b]
The back of the ""glider"" is way too boxy as I said before, but I do like how the black taps and the rounded bricks are being used, as they provide a little bit of detail, in an otherwise bland set. The wings are also on a hinge brick to make it easier to put Mike in. 
[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/MacKin/5921-Research-Glider/researc_glider_009_1.jpg[/img]

[b]Glider wings[/b]
I like the printed design on the wings that makes the ""glider"" very makeshift looking which is very fitting for this theme.
[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/MacKin/5921-Research-Glider/researc_glider_012_1.jpg[/img]

[b]Glider with Mike[/b]
Here's a shot of Mike in his ""glider"" wielding his ""choke chain"". Honestly the size of that thing scares me. Even though Mike has a steering wheel I still get the feeling he could just as easily hold his choke chain to one side or another to turn :wacko: . 
[img]http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/MacKin/5921-Research-Glider/researc_glider_014trim_1.jpg[/img]

[b]Another Use for Choke Chain?[/b]
You know maybe the ""choke chain"", might just be some sort of safety feature on the ""glider"". When the minifig falls off (trust me he will when making a steep turn, as he doesn't have any walls to lean against and can only hold on to the steering wheel), he can just toss the chain up around the glider then climb back up.  Here's a picture of Mike ""demonstrating"".

[b]The Whole Set [/b]
We have time for just one more picture so let's see the entire set together, shall we?

[b]Rating Time![/b]

[b]Price 9/10 [/b] The price isn't bad for what you get. 
[b]Playability 8/10[/b] I think Lego did a good job here in terms of playability; it is fun to fly the ""glider"" around chasing Pterodons while looting their nests for eggs.   
[b]Minifigures 8/10[/b] Mike is a really nice minifigure with plenty of detail, but I think it would have been nice to get a few more accessories 
[b]Design 5/10[/b] The set's design is mediocre at best. There's nothing really special about it and overall it seems rather plain.  
[b]Average 7.5/10[/b]
[b]Overview [/b] 

5921 is a decent set overall built from mostly standard pieces. Although there is nothing [b]really[/b] special it does include a rather nice minifig, and a bunch of useful standard pieces. If you're into Adventurer themed sets you should definitely pick it up from E-Bay or Bricklink. If not this set still may be of some use to you if you are a Castle or Steampunk fan. By itself it isn't that bad of a standalone set if you don't have any other Dino Island sets. I gave it a 3.5 or a 4 out of 5 - how about you?

"Novelty","2007-05-05T23:14:36.5Z","Land Before Time","The idea of this set is nice - a glider and a pterosaur.  The excution and design leaves a lot to be wanting.  The glider doesn't really look like any glider past or present and seems a bit fake and made-up and fictional.

be perfect at first. But when you will complete it and look at it, you will
miss that feeling of perfection. Why? Design of the glider is not very good,
because I never saw a glider like this. And the tree you will get with this set
is at least from my point of view redundant. You can´t even use him in another
sets (only his parts). But I like something - parts are very useful and
pterosaur is a very nice addition to the Dino Island (Adventurers subtheme).

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-22T10:07:55.367Z","LEGO Adventurers (Dino Island) - Research Glider Review","I think this is a good set for little money. We get a tree and a flying dinosaur which is one big piece. We also get the glider for the adventurer who comes with a chain on the staff which he can use to capture the dinosaur. The fins which are used for the glider are from the LEGO Castle (Ninja) theme. These pieces look really good on that vehicle. On the back we get a propeller which spins full 360°. I also like the small engines on that glider and you can also see a steering wheel and a small windscreen on the front. The tree which comes in this set looks very good as well. We get no stickers and the set is very sturdy. As I told you in the beginning: This set is a good set for little money.<br><br>All

"BobaFett2","2011-01-20T12:08:46.327Z","Superb","<p>This set is very odd-it's not a plane-it's confusing. However, it's very well done.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>A very nice scene is set up portraying Mike trying to capture the Pteranodon. There are also some neat and odd alternate ideas on the back of the instructions.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The best parts in this set are definitely the wings and the Pteranodon. Other notable parts include the brown slopes, leaves, spear, propeller, and chain.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Mike is a teen with a LOT of pimples (or freckles). He has slingshot and vest, and makes for a nice minifigure.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's pretty simple, as expected from a 6 dollar set. There wasn't anything unexpected in either the tree or glider.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The glider is quite nice-it looks odd, yet it makes for a nice flying machine. The tree, on the other hand, lacks detail, and could have been better.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall, I'd say this is a pretty good set. It's not the best sets from Dino Island, but it's certainly a good one.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5
