<ul>
	<li>Avatar Pink Zane is a reference to season 1 of ninjago</li>
	<li>Avatar Harumi has the Kill Bill outfit&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Okino gives a new color for Unagami&#39;s&nbsp;hair piece</li>
</ul>

<p>Includes a little item market stand with a knight&#39;s helmet, benny&#39;s unbroken helmet, a sailors hat, a top hat, a rice hat.</p>

<p>Also a weapon&#39;s shop with interesting pieces</p>

<p>A tecno japan temple build</p>

<p>And a little stand for the purple keytana</p>

<p>However, due to the number of figures, the builds suffer, the main temple build can only hold up 2 minifigures, the weapon&#39;s shop only 1 and the item market can only hold 1</p>

<p>The sets consists of three vending stalls but the who/what and how are very unclear to me. Hats, weapons and some sort of secret sword stall?</p>

<p>Luckily I did not buy the set for its &#39;constructual value&#39; (which is low to say the least). The set is clearly designed to be a Battle Pack/Starter Set XL where the focus lies on the figs and the rest is box filler.</p>

<p>And the figures are bizarre and colourful and plenty!<br />
No less than 9 are included, all with great prints, hair and accesories.<br />
<br />
As a play set, I don&#39;t know at all.<br />
As a minifig set : just get it to bring some bright diversification in your population.</p>

"Karrot","2020-11-06T01:41:11.31Z","Digital minifigures galore","<p>This was one of the most fun LEGO sets I&#39;ve built in years, and surprisingly got me feeling nostalgic for my childhood! Growing up, Ninjago was the first theme I really got in to (apart from one&nbsp;Aqua Raiders set for a birthday present), and Gamer&#39;s Market reminded me of exactly why I originally loved it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is not a traditional build - it&#39;s a playset, but with 3 store facades and a whopping 9 minifigures, packed&nbsp;into a really cheap package. I&#39;m not really interested in the more intended-for-children Ninjago builds, but when I saw the detail and variety of minifigs I knew I needed to get this one set from the Prime Empire wave.</p>

<p><strong>Builds:</strong>&nbsp;3 bags for 3 structures (which honestly felt like best to worst, which is surprising for a LEGO set which usually gets the small builds out of the way first). The first red and black design looks like a classic Japanese gateway, but has a large teal piece with a sticker on top digitising it. It uses red loudspeaker and sword pieces interestingly, and holds a question-mark container for a moulded&nbsp;trans-pink sword. The second white/ black/ trans-green stall holds weapons and a drink, with extra colourful swords kept behind the seller&#39;s area. The third assembly is a pink/ black items market, with a &quot;125 Cr&quot; sign, hat sticker with Ninjago-language writing and a bunch of hats on sale for the minifigs to wear.</p>

<p>Looking at the completed models, you can easily set up a marketplace space which is like a lobby or hubworld for these characters in a game, or part of a futuristic science-fiction society space. These are still essential as a backdrop and setting for the best part of the set though, the minifigures (I&#39;d like to preface these descriptions by saying I&#39;m only vaguely aware of the current TV show, but knew the characters from 2011).</p>

<p><strong><em>Avatar Harumi:</em></strong>&nbsp;Kill-Bill type vest, rubbery white headpiece, nice redpaint over eyes on face. Decent.<br />
<strong><em>Red Visor</em>:</strong> Very nice front and back &quot;404&quot; printing, detailed red and blue doublesided faces, nice orange helmet, cool red/ grey gun, very cool black neck-attachment&nbsp;sword holster, bright red swords with an orange healthbar.<br />
<strong><em>Richie:&nbsp;</em></strong>Absolutely amazing moulded head with visor and earpieces,&nbsp;video game controller accessory in red, nice black hairpiece, detailed torso and leg printing and bright orange swords and healthbar.<br />
<strong><em>Okino</em>: </strong>Probably the plainest of the bunch, nice tan satchel, very nice hairpiece, curved silver sword and good face/ torso prints.<br />
<em><strong>Digi Jay</strong></em><strong>:</strong> Awesome, literally a blue power ranger with detailed face/ torso/ leg prints, ghostly-green swords, green healthbar and the new video game controller accessory with a flail attached.<br />
<strong><em>Avatar Pink Zane:&nbsp;</em></strong>Callback to the 2011 Ninjago designs but in pink, with nice silver throwing stars weapons.<br />
<em><strong>Avatar Nya:</strong> </em>Styled like a diver, with a nice hairpiece and breathing apparatus, detailed swimsuit torso print and harpoon accessory.<br />
<em><strong>Avatar Cole: </strong></em>On the plainer side, with a laidback plaid red shirt, two pickaxes and great hair/ moustache combo.<br />
<strong><em>Scott:</em></strong>&nbsp;Very nice ghostly look with light-blue jacket torso and great leg printing, and the very cool new hat/ hoodie hairpiece.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong>As soon as I completed the first step, which was 3 minifigures, I knew this was going to be an awesome set and that my younger self would not be able to contain their excitement at having it. With 3 minifigs per bag, compared to the usual 1 or 2, and with them all being so detailed, there&#39;s practically limitless playability to the set. One could create many detailed storylines and just unrestrained, colourful fun with the cast available. If Ninjago keeps up with the high-end detailed builds but amazing minifig designs available cheaply, the line will be around for a long time.</p>

<p><em>Side-note:</em>&nbsp;Interestingly, the sticker sheet has a bunch of spare round &amp; square 1x1 stickers and rectangular 2x1 sticker patterns. This is an interesting idea that I haven&#39;t seen before in a LEGO set, but lends itself to either DOTS-style decorations or just an added detail to a child&#39;s normal bricks collection.</p>

"JacksonAndJerry15","2020-09-07T15:10:28.24Z","Gamerâ€™s Market: The Quintessential Ninjago Accessory Pack ","<p>This Gamer&#39;s Market set has pretty great value with 9 figures, some great accessories and some nice stickers. Let&#39;s&nbsp;look at the figures first.</p>

<p>Digital Jay: A pretty common figure, but a good one. I especially like the health bar piece they created that you can attach onto his back. I also like the recolour of the standard katanas in mint green.</p>

<p>Charlie (That pink dragon thing): This guy is absolutely great. I don&#39;t care if these pink and olive green dragon thingies are in almost every set this wave, I love them. A good army builder as well.</p>

<p>Red Visor: Even more of an army builder than the dragon things are these guys. It is nice to get an extra one in this set. I don&#39;t mind because there are still 8 other figure spots, so he is not really wasted space.</p>

<p><br />
Avatar Harumi: Good figure, one of my favourites in the set. Wait, I think I recognise&nbsp;that outfit...</p>

<p>Scott: A nice mysterious figure who appears in many other sets. He is not my favorite, but I appreciate his inclusion.</p>

<p>Okino: Nice recolour of that hairpiece. I really like his face and satchel.</p>

<p>Avatar Cole: This figure is amazing. Why does he have a moustache? Why does he have a plaid shirt? Why does he have two pickaxes? I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s incredible. Nice inclusion of that uncommon hair though.</p>

<p>Avatar Nya: The swimsuit outfit is pretty bland, but like Cole, I am glad it includes this uncommon hairpiece.</p>

<p>Pink Zane: You know, I never thought we would see that classic ninjago 2011 outfit ever again, but here we are. This is a great recolour and will probably go up in price a lot once this set retires.</p>

<p>The Builds: There are three builds in this set. Two pretty good ones and one bad one. These three builds together are about $15-$20 value, but I understand the price increase because to $30 because of the inclusion of 9 figures.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Weapon shop: My favourite of the three builds. I really like the white and green design, and the inclusion of many colourful weapons.</p>

<p>Item/Hat shop: I really like this build as well. While nothing too substantial, it does provide many rare and uncommon hats as well as some nice stickers.</p>

<p>Temple of Madness Gate: This build is not very good. The keytana thing is really cool, but the gate is pretty lame. I wish they included a third shop instead. This gate is really only useful if you have the Temple of Madness set.</p>

<p>Final Thoughts: Overall, this set is wonderful. It has 9 great figures and two exciting shops with plenty of rare and colourful accessories. The only bad part is a disappointing gate build. If you are a Ninjago fan or a fan of the video game aesthetic, then this set is a must buy.</p>

"blueshift","2021-08-23T01:36:49.313Z","A stunning minifigure pack with lackluster builds","<p>This set shines as a minifigure and accessory pack, since the figure parts, printing and accessories are simply amazing. I mainly was interested in this set for the novelty of Avatar Harumi&#39;s Kill Bill reference, but most of the prints developed for the Prime Empire line are amazing, including those on Digi Jay and Scott, as well as the two antagonist figures. Plus, the weapons are great, especially since I don&#39;t usually buy Ninjago sets. On the other hand, the builds are pretty disappointing. I plan on parting this out, and there are some semi-interesting pieces in here, but I didn&#39;t really get much out of the build. Some of the most interesting construction was just putting together the Prime Empire armour and the life indicators, which says a lot about how uninteresting I found the construction. Still, this set has some amazing figures in it, and if you can still find it on clearance somewhere, it&#39;s worth picking up for those alone. Even the figures that are mostly part re-use give you a nice flannel shirt and wetsuit, both of which I will definitely find a use for.</p>

<p>As someone who doesn&#39;t collect Ninjago, I look forward to using the figure parts in future cyberpunk themed MOCs, and otherwise will be putting the pieces in my parts bin.</p>
