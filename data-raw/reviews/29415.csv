<p><strong>Jay&#39;s Velocity Racer:&nbsp;</strong>Honestly, I prefer Jay&#39;s Velocity Racer to Lloyd&#39;s Racer and Kai&#39;s Jet from 71707 for a few key reasons.&nbsp; First, it is easier to display.&nbsp; Second, it looks and feels more solid and is easier to play with and carry around.&nbsp; Finally, it has an action feature.&nbsp; Jay&#39;s Racer is easily one of my favorite small vehicles from the last few Ninjago seasons.&nbsp; It feels good, especially for such a small build.&nbsp; The color scheme is simple, white on blue (I appreciate the white on top of the normal Ninja colors).&nbsp; There&#39;s not much to say about the front or body.&nbsp; They are solid, and Jay sits inside a little nook in the center, with a bit of a shield built up in front of the console.&nbsp; Two little wings are built outwards from the Racer, separate from the action feature wings.&nbsp; The back&nbsp;has two nice 1x2 plates with exhaust ports to simulate exhaust from the Racer, behind which are some black&nbsp;pieces that lead to the long green transparent piece&nbsp;shared among the Racers and Kai&#39;s Jet.&nbsp; The majority of the back quarter of the ship is used for the action feature.&nbsp; Being such a small vehicle, I think that the designer did a great job making the mechanism small.&nbsp; Using several small tan gears, a single axle connector (designed to be turned with the &ldquo;Key-Tana&rdquo;)&nbsp; turns outward (and back inward) two additional wings.&nbsp; They extend further than the built-in wings.&nbsp; I love the smoothness of the wing mechanism, with the white wing pieces and flaps and the light blue 1x10 blade piece for design and detail.&nbsp; This action feature is great, though simple (warning: it can sometimes become misaligned and the gears need to be pushed back inwards.)&nbsp; Another point about this build is the good placement of Prime Empire themed stickers.&nbsp; All in all, the Racer is great.</p>

<p><strong>Lloyd&#39;s Velocity Racer:&nbsp;</strong>Lloyd&#39;s Racer is slightly lesser than Jay&#39;s, at least in my opinion.&nbsp; However, it is still great.&nbsp; At first, the build felt very compact, but then the wheels were added on and provided a ton of length.&nbsp; The wheels roll very smoothly, although the front wheel&nbsp;can feel a little stuck sometimes.&nbsp; It seems like the same problem that bothers many LEGO bikes (for example Lloyd&#39;s bike in the 70722 Overborg Attack); the technic pieces squeeze the wheels too tightly until they act&nbsp;as brakes.&nbsp; I have yet to find a permanent solution to this... it may just need the technic pieces to be pulled outwards regularly.&nbsp; The underside is a simple grey color, with only one out-of-place color -- the yellow technic bolt pieces in the front.&nbsp; The main part is mostly green, with nice angled shapes to capture the bike feel.&nbsp; I appreciate the number of well-placed Prime-Empire themed stickers, as well as the car engine pieces used on either side.&nbsp; The mint green katanas and 1x10 blade pieces around the seat are a great touch to the darker green.&nbsp; The seat&nbsp;area opens as the blade pieces and the slanted shield build on the front are pulled forwards.&nbsp; Reviewing&nbsp;this Racer, I really enjoy the build and I appreciate it even more now than before</p>

<p><strong>Playability:&nbsp;</strong>I was disappointed by the lack of stud shooters on these builds.&nbsp; This isn&#39;t a major deal, but it was the first thing I noticed while thinking about the playability, and it is why I gave this a 3 for playability.&nbsp; Jay&#39;s Racer&#39;s action feature is a nice playable touch, which makes it very fun to use.&nbsp; Lloyd&#39;s Racer rolls smoothly and is a nice addition to Ninjago&#39;s collection of bikes.&nbsp; Between the two Racers, I&#39;d say you get a fair amount of playability because they are vehicles.&nbsp; Each has a nice amount of imaginative potential.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong>The minifigures from this set are appropriate and well-designed.&nbsp; I like seeing 3 minifigures in&nbsp;a $30 set, although more would have been nice.&nbsp; Jay and Lloyd ride their respective vehicles, and the rat enemy Hausner serves as the main enemy from the &ldquo;Speedway Five Billion&rdquo; race in&nbsp;Prime Empire episode 11.&nbsp; Like I said in my review of 71707 Kai&#39;s Mech Jet, Digi Jay looks very similar to Kai, just blue.&nbsp; The white is in most of the same places, including the right arm.&nbsp; The four blue circles are in the same area they are on Kai and look nice.&nbsp; Lloyd, on the other hand, has a mint green right arm (which I really like) and more of a sash-like design&nbsp;across his torso with three circles rather than four.&nbsp; For some reason, Lloyd has one black hand (on his left hand) and one white hand.&nbsp; I dislike this, as it makes the black hand blend in.&nbsp; Both Jay and Lloyd have the nice-looking, white sword-holders and Digi masks with their color and symbol.&nbsp; They also both have the Digi face, and confident, almost arrogant, alternate faces.&nbsp; In my opinion, their alternate faces look new and excellent and round out the great-looking Digi minifigures they are.&nbsp; If I had to complain about something, it would be how common these two minifigures are, appearing in several other Prime Empire sets each.&nbsp; The rat enemy looks okay; I dislike them in general, but the design is&nbsp;accurate to the show and works well.&nbsp; The heads are very interesting, as well as the black sword-holders and technological weapons.</p>

<p><strong>Price:&nbsp;</strong>Am I happy paying $29.99 for this?&nbsp; I&#39;m not unhappy.&nbsp; For the amount of stuff in front of me, I&#39;d really like to see a sale on this set somewhere.&nbsp; The price-to-part ratio, however, is nice, and the parts selection here looks fantastic.</p>

<p><strong>Recap:&nbsp;</strong>This is not the most amazing set I&#39;ve ever seen, and my hesitation to like Prime Empire puts this set down for me.&nbsp; However, in my opinion, it is one of, if not the best set in the Prime Empire wave, and includes two excellent vehicles that are&nbsp;great for play&nbsp;and adding to a Ninjago collection.&nbsp; They feel good, they look great, and they just <em>are </em>even better.</p>
