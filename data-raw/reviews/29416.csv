<p>I&#39;ll start off with the bad. There are these unsightly gaps in the side of the car and the back end doesn&#39;t look too great. There are quite a few exposed studs and technic pins that should have been covered. The worst part of the set has to be the trunk area. You can&#39;t really do much with&nbsp;it and it wastes space that could have been used for an additional seat. The back of the box says you can put the loot box side build inside but it doesn&#39;t fit at all. The best thing you can put in it is a 2x2 crate with a flat tile on top as the lid. This is not included in the set, and the set would be a lot better if it was included. I like to put a blaster pistol in mine because that&#39;s Scott&#39;s weapon in the show.</p>

<p>But you know what? I like this set, despite all its flaws. How is that possible, you may ask?</p>

<p>The Minifigure selection is good, not great. Digi Kai comes in 3 other sets, so he&#39;s nothing special. Why didn&#39;t this set have Nya? That would have improved it a lot. Scott is an excellent figure, but he also comes in Gamer&#39;s Market which I&#39;m sure most Ninjago fans have already. The best thing is the two Red Visors. They are fantastic figures and great for army building. They&#39;re not available from Bricks and Pieces so this is a great way to get two of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hood of the car looks&nbsp;amazing. The build techniques used are really neat and snapping the hood in is really satisfying. It&#39;s very detailed with some neat stickers. The color scheme is very unique, and it works. We don&#39;t get many gray and blue vehicles in Ninjago, so this is a nice change of pace from the millions of Kai and Lloyd vehicles we get every wave. The windshield piece is super cool. I love the color and it really helps the &quot;futuristic car&quot; aesthetic. The blades the pop out on the sides are very fun.</p>

<p>But the best part by far is the wheels and their rotation. The wheels are connected to ratchet joints so you can turn them sideways. If the wheels have rotated by 4 or less clicks, the car can still roll along on surfaces. It looks&nbsp;awesome this way and it&#39;s really satisfying since the wheels still turn so smoothly. This feature rescues the set. If it didn&#39;t have this feature, it would be terrible.</p>

<p>So overall, I like this set, mostly because it&#39;s different. I&#39;m so sick of the same old bikes, cars, and mechs we get every wave so please make more sets like this LEGO! Just make sure you fix the minor issues.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this set is selling very well so it&#39;ll probably go on clearance by the end of its shelf life. At that point, you should certainly pick it up.</p>
