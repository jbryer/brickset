"CaptainCalamari","2020-12-10T19:50:42.393Z","A good set that could have been so much more","<p>I love the aesthetic of this set. It&#39;s basically a cyberpunk Japanese Temple. And it pulls that off so well.&nbsp; It&#39;s a new and fresh idea that still feels like Ninjago.</p>

<p>The architecture is the strongest point of this set. The use of black 2x2 Technic Double Bearing Plates&nbsp;upside down works great for the shingles in the roof. The shaping and Geometry are very linear, and I appreciate that. The unconventional color scheme of Red, Black, Teal, and Trans-Orange sounds like it would be a disaster, but it&#39;s surprisingly spectacular.</p>

<p>The overall structural integrity of this set is one of the best I&#39;ve ever seen. You can pick it up by the top and it won&#39;t break. It&#39;s very sturdy thanks to the many technic pins holding it together.</p>

<p>This set has an incredible play feature, which is inserting the&nbsp;Keytana into the top and twisting it, which opens&nbsp;the doors to the main interior. It works so well and it&#39;s incredibly satisfying. The door mechanism is really neat and it holds the ground and upper floor together so well it&#39;s almost impossible to prize them apart. The construction of this feature is surprisingly difficult, you have to carefully line up all the gears to make it work. It&#39;s not incredibly&nbsp;hard but it&#39;s certainly more than your average Ninjago set.</p>

<p>There are a few problems though. The blades at the very tippy-top of the set tend to fall down very easily and aren&#39;t securely attached. The interior is very crowded and lacking, especially the sushi kitchen area. There&#39;s this thing that drops evil sushi rolls on the players on the steps below that takes up over half the space. It&#39;s a fun feature, but I think they could have positioned it better. On the right side, there&#39;s this weapon rack and an arcade machine. Why do we need a weapon rack? It seems like a waste of space.</p>

<p>The minifigure selection is decent, though 6 figures for $80 isn&#39;t the best. Digi Jay and Lloyd are very common, so they&#39;re not too special. Digi Cole comes in only one other set, in which he doesn&#39;t have shoulder pads and all his other gear. So he&#39;s a very good inclusion. The villains in this set are Unagami, Sushimi, and a Red Visor. Unagami is a nice figure, though he&#39;s obtainable in two other sets. Sushimi is an excellent exclusive figure. His design is so fun and imaginative. He&#39;s a frickin evil sushi chef with red skin wielding two butcher knives. What&#39;s not to love?&nbsp;The Red Visor is good for army building, but I really think this set could have used another one.</p>

<p>The overall quality of the 6 minifigures is incredible. Ninjago tends to make really good minifigures, and these are certainly no exception.</p>

<p>So overall, this is a very good set that seems like it&#39;s on the verge of greatness but just doesn&#39;t quite reach it. The value is ok for $80, but compared to the great prices of recent Ninjago sets, it&#39;s unimpressive. The figures themselves are very good, but there should have been more. The overall design is very good, but there needs to be more interior space. The playability is certainly there, though, and I would still recommend this set.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">While they may be a bit overdone, it&rsquo;s hard to deny that the Ninjago theme consistently puts out a lot of good temple sets. <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71712-1/Empire-Temple-of-Madness"">71712: Empire Temple of Madness</a> piqued my interest when I first saw it specifically because it retained a lot of the typical Ninjago temple elements while combining them with a unique color palette, so it did eventually make its way into my collection. The question now is whether this strange-looking palace holds up to its elder siblings.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Minifigures</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">This set comes with six minifigures, which I feel is reasonable for an $80 set. On the side of the heroes are three ninja: Jay, Lloyd, and Cole. They are all relatively similar, featuring their main colors as well as a lighter secondary color. Normally I like asymmetrical minifigure designs but I feel like the lighter colors work against the main colors a bit too much, so my favorite is probably Cole, who has the most symmetrical design of the three (both of his arms are the same color but one of his hands is gray while the other is black). I will say though that they look much better in person than in the pictures.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The ninja are opposed by three antagonists. First up is one of the Red Visors, which are the fodder of Emperor Unagami&rsquo;s army, I think. He (it?) wears a black robe with teal and red decoration, which looks quite nice. The facial expressions are also menacing, making this fellow a great little distraction for the ninja while Unagami takes over the world or whatever. Speaking of which, Unagami is also included in this set. Like the Red Visor, he has a black robe with red and teal decoration, although his is a bit less recognizable as actual clothing, and he has a dress piece for legs to signify his importance. His facial expressions are kind of weird looking, but you can&rsquo;t see them too much anyway since he has a long white beard, which is accompanied by a white hair piece. The final villain in the set is the only exclusive minifigure, a chef who goes by the name of Sushimi. He stands out even amongst this eclectic cast of characters due to his striking white and red color palette. Sushimi features quite a bit of detailing, with stains marking his torso and legs. His face is also quite expressive, and on the whole I find him to be the stand out character of the set. My only minor gripe with him is that the stains look sort of pixelated, which limits the use of his pieces outside of a video game setting. That said, it&rsquo;s not super noticeable, and his bright red skin will probably limit his torso from appearing on a lot of custom minifigures anyways. While not a minifigure, there is also a strange little eyeball monster holding a katana. Honestly I have no idea what the deal with this thing is, but I guess it&rsquo;s supposed the fight the ninja? I honestly forgot it existed until I looked at a picture of the contents of the set online before I started writing this review.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Overall it&rsquo;s a solid selection of minifigures. It doesn&rsquo;t have amazing value, but it&rsquo;s perfectly reasonable for the price and size of the set. My only real complaint with the total selection is that there is only one Red Visor. For a grunt type character, Red Visors are pretty rare, coming in 3 sets, which is the same amount as the main villain of this wave. That said that&rsquo;s more an issue with the overall wave and less with this set.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Build</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The entirety of the pieces in this set are dedicated to the one build, which I like. Nothing here feels tacked on to add play value. As for the build itself, I think it&rsquo;s great. It isn&rsquo;t revolutionary, and I think that some past temples still look superior, but it&rsquo;s clear that the Ninjago designers have gotten really good at making nice looking temples. What makes this one really stand out is of course the radically different color scheme. The building is primarily black, with a bit of red and a dash of teal to spice things up. The front looks excellent, and the sides are good too. The back is alright, but it was left open for access to the structure&rsquo;s insides so it isn&rsquo;t especially pretty. Normally that wouldn&rsquo;t be much of a problem for me, but I do find it strange in this set given how little interior there is. The only real inside to speak of is the small throne room on the first floor, though there is also space for minifigures to stand on the roof area above Unagami&rsquo;s throne. There is only one main feature to speak of, that being the door opening function. By twisting the keytana at the top of the temple when it is inside of a small holder, the door to Unagami&rsquo;s throne room opens. It&rsquo;s simple but effective, my favorite kind of feature in a set. There isn&rsquo;t really much else to touch on with the build. I think it looks pretty great, and it will definitely stand out amongst pretty much any other Lego building you have. I suppose that could be considered a negative, but personally I think the unique look is the strongest part of this set.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Parts, Build Experience, and Miscellaneous Thoughts</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The only thing that really stood out to me about the parts in this set was that there is quite a bit of teal, though not enough to warrant buying the set for it. Otherwise it has most of the standard unique pieces of the Winter 2020 Ninjago wave: the translucent yellow-green blades, the armor and health bar combo (which all of the minifigures sans Unagami have), and all three keytanas. This is the only set that features all three, but they aren&rsquo;t exactly hard to come by either so I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a huge selling point.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">I found the build to be fun, but it was simple as is the case with a lot of Ninjago sets. I don&rsquo;t really have much else to comment on in that department, and the only other thing I really want to say about this set is that the stickers were somewhat bothersome. Obviously no one like stickers, but I can handle them normally. It just irritates me when they are supposed to go on translucent pieces since it&rsquo;s really easy to see any imperfections in their placement, and this set makes you do that multiple times.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Overall</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">This is just all around a good Lego set. It isn&rsquo;t a masterpiece, and if you&rsquo;re just looking for a larger action playset then I would recommend <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71722-1/Skull-Sorcerer-s-Dungeons"">71722: Skull Sorcerer&#39;s Dungeons</a> over this one, but for what it is this a good set. The color scheme is different and comes together great, the minifigures are fun, and the build itself is good too. It rounds out the Prime Empire sub-theme quite well, and so if you enjoyed some of the smaller sets and want something better this a great option for you. </span></span></p>
