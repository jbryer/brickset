The dragon offers some moderate complexity but not so much that younger builders have issues following the build book. The joints of the dragon a strong and flexible, offering a large range of motion at all the joints without coming apart easily. The result makes this set extremely playable for all ages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three minifigs&nbsp;adds a lot of value to this set. The ninjas have a huge variety of weapons that make this set really enjoyable to play with, and versatile for Lego dioramas. Overall this set is tops as far as value!</p>
