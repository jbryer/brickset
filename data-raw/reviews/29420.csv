<p>Now, I am a big fan of Asian Culture and liked Ninjago forever. Ninjago City and Destiny&#39;s Bounty are among my very limited display space. My kids love Ninjago as well and we frequently rewatch it on Netflix. But this build encapsulated nothing from the spirit of the show, or anything really. It is a weirdly shaped box, that are too big to even reassemble the Arcade Machines they are supposed to look like at Minifig scale. Two minifigures that you can&#39;t use in any setting because of the weird look. If this is the direction Ninjago is going, that will be the end of this IP for me.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-55dc1fb1-7fff-937a-3fc8-cdc2f15831f1"">Intro</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-55dc1fb1-7fff-937a-3fc8-cdc2f15831f1"">Ninjago has featured several series of minifigure-based packs. However, most of these have either been just minifigures and accessories or spinjitzu/airjitzu pods. Therefore, the idea of an arcade cabinet to store minifigures is intriguing.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-55dc1fb1-7fff-937a-3fc8-cdc2f15831f1"">Minifigures</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-55dc1fb1-7fff-937a-3fc8-cdc2f15831f1"">Kai is the ninja in this set and he is wearing this season&rsquo;s themed garb. The digital elements are nicely printed on the front and back. I especially like how white was incorporated into the look. His right arm and double molded mask exemplify this characteristic. He has a double sided head as well. One side evokes some sort of heads up display and the other side conveys a shocked expression.</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-55dc1fb1-7fff-937a-3fc8-cdc2f15831f1"">Kai also gets a second minifigure in this set, his avatar. The avatar has so many tremendous features that it&rsquo;s hard to narrow down a favorite aspect of this minifigure.&nbsp;The wrappings on the legs add depth as do the lava-like marks across his torso. I particularly perused the tattoo underneath his right shoulder. The red-painted expression aptly reflects Kai and the hairpiece above, made for Kai in 2017, is new in this color. The reverse excites me most, though. The cobra patch is exquisitely detailed and brings out the best in this refined figure.</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-55dc1fb1-7fff-937a-3fc8-cdc2f15831f1"">The Completed Model</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-55dc1fb1-7fff-937a-3fc8-cdc2f15831f1"">As the piece count suggests, there isn&rsquo;t much to build in this set. However, the sticker sheet emphasizes the overriding factor. Most of the build time is actually spent applying the stickers. However, the end result is well worth the effort. The arcade cabinet looks lovely when complete, evoking a strong sense of nostalgia. The design on top reminds us of the Asian roots this theme captures. Unfortunately, turning the pod around reveals the unfinished roof which probably could have used some more development. The minifigures have an excess of space to themselves. The accessories earn a prized perch on the hinged door. Although more room is available inside, I doubt the designers could have expanded more upon the subject matter.</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-55dc1fb1-7fff-937a-3fc8-cdc2f15831f1"">Overall</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-55dc1fb1-7fff-937a-3fc8-cdc2f15831f1"">I am glad I acquired this model. The nostalgic theme is inviting. The minifigures are top-notch, especially Avatar Kai. However, I don&rsquo;t think avid builders will enjoy the small part count or the large stickers. Minifigure collectors on the other hand will want to pick up this pod immediately. Avatar Kai is not to be missed and the novelty of storing him in an arcade cabinet is exemplary. Therefore, I would recommend purchasing this pod promptly.</b></p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2021-03-16T14:28:21.053Z","I didnâ€™t know Kai was a Cobra Kai student...","<p>I initially thought that I&rsquo;d only own Jay&rsquo;s arcade pod as the Super Star Rockin Jay appealed to me the most out of the 3 avatar figures. But the Avatar Kai minifigure really grew on me and I figured I&rsquo;d get Digi Kai this way as well, and with a clearance price that I got this for, it was an easy buy.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p><b>The Arcade Pod: </b>This is basically the same build as the other 2 pods where the whole build mostly revolves around the one big specialized arcade cabinet piece. 1 sticker goes on the front and 2 large stickers are placed on either side of the piece, I wish there was printed detail instead, but not a huge issue. As for the designs of the stickers themselves, it has yellow Ninjago language written on it, and while they are cool and not necessarily bad, it looks pretty bland compared to the stickers of the Lloyd and Jay pod. A 2x4 tile with the game control buttons sticker on it is attached to the arcade cabinet piece and a clear panel is used to be able to show the figure you want to display. The back hatch of the pod could open up from a clip hinge and secured stud connection and it has clips on the inside of it to hold onto accessories. To display the digi ninja, just stand it on the pedestal and you could break up the avatar figure into pieces to store them in the pod as well. Finally, I like how the top looks complete using a few more pieces to finish off the design of the pod. Overall, while I think the sticker designs are less interesting on this arcade pod compared to the other 2, it&rsquo;s still a great build and design and I really like it, especially for its originality.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs&nbsp;</h3>

<p><b>Avatar Kai: </b>Now for the main reason I bought this set, is for this fantastic exclusive Avatar variant for Kai. The legs are from previous versions of Kai but the torso is exclusive, sporting a red gi with some yellow electricity on it, and at the back there&rsquo;s a cobra, hmm.... a Cobra on a character named Kai? That&rsquo;s a clever reference! He&rsquo;s got a very confident grin for his face and his hair is exclusively available here in bright light yellow, which was a nice and welcome recolor. Finally, his accessory is a bundle of dynamite sticks and a flame piece. Overall, I wasn&rsquo;t so sure I was going to like this figure at first, but it grew on me and I ended up loving it, and the Cobra Kai reference makes me love it even more!</p>

<p><b>Digi Kai: </b>Admittedly, Digi Kai is no where near as special as Avatar Kai, mainly for appearing in 3 other sets, but lucky for me, the 3 other sets he appeared in didn&rsquo;t interest me, so I figured I&rsquo;d obtain him this way. His digi armor looks great and suitable for a video game world, although his legs and torso looks strikingly similar to Digi Jay&rsquo;s. The white shoulder armor/sword sheath is present and it holds the healthbar attachment, a pretty clever design in general, no katanas are included here though. His face prints have one side with the VR glasses on and the other side has a very worried expression, which was nice considering we get the movie face prints over and over. The mask looks distinct compared to previous ones and it certainly fits the video game aesthetic, and it looks fantastic with the VR glasses to go with it. Finally his accessory is the game controller hilt in gold with a sword attachment from the weapons pack. Overall, he&rsquo;s not my favorite of the digi ninjas, but he still looks great and I&rsquo;m glad to own him.</p>

<h3>Value for Money&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The value for the arcade pods are ... pretty alright. R200 for this seems a bit high, but with a little discount, the price works for me.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>While I think this Arcade Pod is the weakest for having the least interesting stickers of the 3, it&rsquo;s still a nice build that displays well and has a good color scheme. Avatar Kai is a fantastic figure and the obvious highlight of the set, and Digi Kai is available here if you have no interest in the other sets he appeared in. I&rsquo;d recommend it, especially if you&rsquo;re a fan of Prime Empire.</p>

"legom0nk3ys","2020-08-25T06:15:09.057Z","A Great Change","<p>I bought this set for the character I wanted. Since this is cheap, and its overall size is small, I thought it was pretty nice and adorable.</p>

<p>The exclusive figure is kine of bland compared to the others, but I was still grateful for the new prints.The other&nbsp;figure was not exclusive, but it was still nice to get. Although I would like to have seen the two spring green katanas included as well, I understood why&nbsp;as the spacing inside the pod wasn&#39;t enough.</p>

<p>The build for this set uses two new pieces for the arcade machine look. This is not minifigure sized at all but it still looks great. There is a window on the front where the screen should be and the back opens up to reveal a weapons rack. They include a fire piece, a dynamite stick the health bar attachment and a katana with a game controller hilt. This piece&nbsp;is exclusive in gold and black but I wish they had included a white one instead as it looks slightly out of place in my opinion. In addition to the katana, the set also includes different weapons in transparent florescent green to switch out. This introduces a lot more options for play or display.</p>

<p>There are three stickers in the set, one for the joystick and buttons, the other two for the side decorations. The stickers on the side are a pain to apply, and they can easily look wrong if tilted slightly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions for this set is a folded sheet like those for a polybag, and it&nbsp;has some fun features to it. The packaging is in the shape of an arcade machine, and the size of the box can fool you into thinking that the toy is larger than its actual size.</p>

<p>Overall, this set is a great parts pack and display piece. It is a lot better than the spinjitsu slam from last year because it is not just another spinner. The price for this is OK for the size but ten dollar sets are always great to see.&nbsp;I hope they keep making things like this in the future, though they already made spinjitsu bursts...at the end of the day, this pod is great. I highly recommend this set.</p>
