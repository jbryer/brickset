<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In recent years, we have received a lot of the&nbsp;$9.99 sets for Ninjago containing one minifigure and a small build focused on a single gimmick (Spinjitzu Masters, for example). Some of these were great, like the Legacy Spinners and Spinjitzu Slam, while others weren&#39;t so good. Fortunately, I think that the Arcade Pods released in early 2020 may be&nbsp;the best ones yet. In this review, I will be taking a look at one of them:&nbsp;Jay Avatar &mdash; Arcade Pod.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>The packaging for this set (and the other Arcade Pods as well) looks&nbsp;fantastic! The box is shaped like the actual Arcade Pods with very similar details on both sides. On the front you can see a CGI version of Jay&#39;s Avatar and a picture of the actual Digi Jay minifigure. On the back there are all of the different features of the set shown.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Instructions and building experience</strong></p>

<p>Unfortunately, much like the other 10 dollar gimmick Ninjago sets, most of the build is made around a single piece base, which makes the model very easy to build. There are also quite a few large stickers included, which may be hard to apply for some. The instructions were very simple to follow. However, I don&#39;t like how they are the cheaper fold out style, typically included in polybags and CMFs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Again, much like in other Ninjago sets of this type, there are&nbsp;a lot of big specialised pieces included. Obviously, we have the actual Arcade Pod base, which is the same part as in the other Arcade Pods, but it&#39;s exclusive to this set in blue. We also have the new &ldquo;door&rdquo; piece in dark gray, the new controller piece in gold, and the pack of accessories in transparent fluorescent green. For minifigure parts, we have Jay&#39;s new hair in white, the Prime Empire ninja mask in blue and white, and an exclusive torso and face for Avatar Jay. However, besides the base piece and some of Jay&#39;s parts, no other pieces are exclusive to this set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>For minifigures, we have two different Jay variants: Digi Jay and Avatar Jay (also known as&nbsp;Superstar Rockin&#39; Jay). To my knowledge, this is the first time when multiples of the same Ninja are included in one set. However, both Jay variants are very different.</p>

<p>The first and less unique of the two Jay suits included is Digi Jay. While he&#39;s not exclusive to this set and appears in four others, he is still a nice looking minifigure. Jay is decked out with his full Prime Empire armour and a transparent fluorescent green sickle with a golden hilt. I like how this version of Jay is&nbsp;asymmetrical, which makes him more unique compared to other blue ninja suits. The left side of his gi is white, while the right side is blue with a white hand/glove. Underneath his Prime Empire mask, he&#39;s got two new faces: one with his VR headset and an upset expression, and one with a very confident look. On the back of the figure there is a health board showing that Jay has unfortunately lost one of his four lives. You can also fit two katanas into his backpack. Overall, I really like this Jay variant and he&#39;s definitely one of my favourite Ninjago minifigures released in 2020.</p>

<p>However, as much as I like Digi Jay, the real highlight of this set is&nbsp;Superstar Rockin&#39; Jay! This version of the lightning ninja has white hair, which can be used to make some anime inspired characters, and light blue skin, making him stand out a lot compared to the rest of the Avatar ninja. He has an open blue jacket on which you can see a lot of shiny details. On his back there is a printed yellowish green guitar, which is weird, since the actual guitar that comes with Jay is dark azur. The only bad thing about this figure is that his legs are the same as Digi Jay&#39;s, which is fine, since they match his torso printing pretty well. In conclusion, I think that Avatar Jay looks fantastic and may be my favourite Ninjago minifigure of 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Like I said, the Arcade Pod is a very simple build. Most of the model is made with one hollow piece, in which you can fit both of the minifigures. While you can fit one figure with no problems, the other one must be disassembled to be able to fit inside, which is unfortunate. You can also fit most of the weapons and accessories included on the back of the Pod, but there isn&#39;t enough clip pieces&nbsp;for all of them. The actual Arcade Pod looks great and is a fantastic display piece, especially if you have a figure inside.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Since this set is made primarily for display, the playability is very poor. The only play you can get out of this set is with the minifigures, which isn&#39;t a lot. Unlike in the other gimmick sets for Ninjago, this one has absolutely no play functions, aside from opening and closing the Arcade Pod.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Like I said, the main highlight of this set and the other Arcade Pods are the minifigures included. Both Digi Jay and Avatar Jay look amazing and are fantastic additions to any Ninjago collection. The actual model looks very nice and is great for display.&nbsp;However, if you are looking for a cheap set with cool play features, I wouldn&#39;t really recommend this one. If you are a Ninjago fan and you like Jay, definitely consider picking this one up.</p>

<p>Minifigs:The set includes two minifigs. The first minifig is Digi Jay.&nbsp; Although he appeared in 71708 gamers market, Digi Jay is a nice inclusion. He has a&nbsp;dual moulded hooded cowl, a nice torso,&nbsp;leg print, and a backpack with a clip for his health bar.&nbsp; The second minifig is new&nbsp;in this set,&nbsp;Avatar Jay. He has a sleek&nbsp;torso,&nbsp;head, and&nbsp;leg&nbsp;print, and cool hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build:The build begins with the base, a 6x6 plate. Then, the arcade body is added. There is an excessive amount of stickers, witch can be a bit annoying. The top display is added next.&nbsp;The last thing added is the back of the arcade. The body and back of the arcade are useless for anything other than the intended purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Conclusion:I think this set is a cool set, but it is not worth 10 USD. However, if you can find it for 8 USD or lower, it is a must-buy.</p>
