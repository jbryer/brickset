<p>OK, lets start with the build. There isn&#39;t much to it, and yeah 2 points is generous. I was going to give the build 1 star, but I&#39;m going to give it two because it isn&#39;t printed, but has stickers!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;ll wait a moment for those who&#39;ve fainted at my heresy to recover....</p>

<p>Everyone back with us? Without the stickers, it&#39;s anything that is shaped like that. The console itself is a booth. That&#39;s anything from a kissing booth (kids, ask your grandparents) to a toll booth to an early ATM in a simple, easy to place form. This works for me because a large part of what my LEGO are used for is as props in a pen-and-pencil role playing games. I could brick build a toll booth or the the portal to the crank room for the portcullis at the castle gate, but inevitably I take those apart. This I can just place where ever. It could even be used in a city setting- I (very briefly) worked as a kiosk cashier at a mall gas station when I was much younger. This could even be one of those booths. Or it could be a japanese-style&nbsp;super vending machine. And the back door, all by itself, needs just a little bit to be an amazing vault door or naval bulkhead hatch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, the second star on the build is there, possibly unjustly, but it is there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figures. Unlike the Spinjitzu&nbsp;gizmos there are two here. And they&#39;re pretty good. The cyberninja is great, particularly with the glowing eyes face behind the mask. The torso print is very evocative of TRON and other cyber punk type settings. I see some people being meh on the legs, but honestly I don&#39;t like sets where there is a bunch of printing to show stuff carried strapped to the legs (personal bias based on IRL&nbsp;experience). And the mask is very good, but I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;ve seen it before.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other Lloyd, the post apocalypse one, is also very nicely executed. The face tats are very reminiscent of what we could be seeing in Star Wars for a Mirilian&nbsp;character. I like the gold mohawk and the torso and leg prints are both very good. As if Ninjago City and Apocolypseburg&nbsp;high schools had an exchange program. BOth of these work very well as game propage as a result.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Where this shines is the accessories. I like the baseball bat, it looks great. There is also a lovely collection of trans green weapon heads that can be used with any handle. For space/SW/cyberspace props, they are amazing as energy blades, or in high fantasy as magical ones. An all&nbsp;trans green katana would be cool, but there are a pair of&nbsp;hiltless blades that like the kama&nbsp;and the scimitar (dao?) blades are ment to be used with the controler-handle. I like this controller mold much more than the one we&#39;ve seen before in the CMFs&nbsp;and I hope it becomes a regular component in many unprinted colors. There are a pair of light daggers as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But I want to point something out- the blade-only katana can mount to any kind of holder. Like a lightsaber handle. And if molded in black.... Lets just say it is a piece I&#39;m lookig forward to seeing in black.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Oddly enough, Brickset&#39;s parts count ignores the 9 energy blades. And some of the body parts. So it is pushing sixty parts if you if you part out poor Llody. Or do accessory sets like the blades not count?</p>

<p>Over all, it&#39;s a good set. If it was one figure, I&#39;d say horribly over priced, but with the second and the new and novel components was it worth $10. I give it an overall of 3.5. As a set, it&#39;s a parts kit with two cool minifigs; from a story telling perspective, it is has more than $10 worth of potential.&nbsp;</p>

"EnergyBlast_Productions","2020-03-04T00:19:53.563Z","One of LEGO's Best Ideas Yet!","<p>As a longtime Ninjago fan and fan of small &quot;gimmick&quot; sets in general, the numerous types of spinners and flyers that LEGO&nbsp;have released for the theme since 2011 have all been really great, but I always wondered if they would try something completely different.&nbsp; The new Arcade Pods for 2020 are, in my opinion, one of LEGO&#39;s best ideas yet, and have so much more value than a lot of other sets at the same price range.</p>

<h2>Building Experience</h2>

<p>This set only took me around 5-8 minutes, which is understandable considering the small amount of pieces and the fact that a large chunk of the arcade pod is made up of a large console piece.&nbsp; Still, I enjoyed building this for what it is, although applying the large stickers correctly without messing up was definitely something that made me nervous, haha.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>Rather than including just one minifigure, as these types of gimmick sets tend to do, the Arcade Pod includes two separate figures of Lloyd - one in his fully decked out 2020 Prime Empire armor, and the other in a very goofy yet awesome looking &quot;avatar&quot; look that fits the video game theme well.</p>

<p>The Prime Empire armored Lloyd is a gorgeous figure, with a ton of intricate printing and detail.&nbsp; I love how they threw in some spring and lime green prints in with his typical bright green color scheme, and like the other ninja in this wave, there&#39;s a good bit of white incorporated into the design.&nbsp; Both the mask and shoulder armor are new parts for 2020, with somewhat of a visor for Lloyd to look out of, and the armor juts out in the back with a small hole in which you can attach a lightsaber rod piece with a healthbar on top, giving&nbsp;off a really clever video game look.&nbsp; Lloyd has new face prints this wave, with the first face being a very similar rehash of the print from last year&#39;s Spinjitzu Slam sets, and the second print bearing a new and awesome digital visor over Lloyd&#39;s eyes.</p>

<p>Lloyd&#39;s Avatar figure&#39;s most obvious distinction is his golden mohawk, which replaces his normal blonde hairpiece.&nbsp; The face print is also new on this figure, with a rather frustrated expression and a golden goatee.&nbsp; The torso print sports an open green jacket with his chest underneath, with one gold sleeve and one green one.&nbsp; My only real complaint, and I really hate that this messes up an otherwise great figure, is the poor job of printing on the legs.&nbsp; For whatever reason, LEGO printed a bunch of green on gold legs and then didn&#39;t continue the design to the sides of the legs.&nbsp; I know they rarely do that, if ever, but this design in particular really needs something like that.&nbsp; Unless you&#39;re looking perfectly straight at the exact front of the figure, the glaring issue on the legs will always be noticeable.&nbsp; His accessory is a baseball bat, which is really nice to get in a small set.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>The Arcade Pod sets take on a whole new approach when comparing Ninjago&#39;s gimmick sets.&nbsp; This build acts more so like the various $12 battle pod sets we got in 2018 for various ninja: a &quot;pod&quot; build that opens and closes with room inside to store your minifigure and some accessories.&nbsp; Although, this one is actually practical, and the design they pulled off with the new console piece is really really good.&nbsp; Sure, the build does heavily depend on two large stickers on the sides and another under the console screen, but the shape of it is what really drew me in.&nbsp; The sticker designs, by the way, are beautiful.&nbsp; They do what Lloyd sets do best - lots of green with gold dragons all over it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build opens easily with the use of simple hinges, and the entire console stays slightly held shut by two stud holes.&nbsp; There&#39;s plenty of space on the back half to store all of Lloyd&#39;s weapons, and you can set the figure down behind the screen to give off the idea that he&#39;s really in the video game.&nbsp; This makes the pod such a banger among other small sets I have on display, and I&#39;m glad this wasn&#39;t the only one they made.</p>

<h2>The Price</h2>

<p>The price is honestly perfect.&nbsp; I have no complaints, and as much as I did point out the flaws on Avatar Lloyd&#39;s legs, the two figs are still awesome and the fact that you get two figs in one $10 set, let alone two NINJA, is really nice.&nbsp; It works as a great weapons pack, too, for those who want a lot of those trans neon green weapon parts.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>This set is great, I love it more than I expected, and it has satisfyingly good value.&nbsp; Great figs, great build, great stickers, great display piece.&nbsp; All around, a great job by LEGO.</p>
