"BelgianBricker","2020-06-19T19:30:45.803Z","A decent start","<p>I had high hopes for this new Ninjago-wave. The sets looked great and the addition of gameplay was intriguing. Let&#39;s see if my hope was justified...</p>

<h3>FIGS</h3>

<p>Oh, yeah. Let&#39;s start with one of the good things about this set: the figures.&nbsp;<br />
We get 4 figs in this relatively small set and that alone is absolutely great. The ninja&#39;s have gotten an update in there clothing, and they look fantastic: nice shoulder armour, stunning prints with subtle detailing on the torsos, gorgeous looking shields. I could not have asked for more. The only downside I see is that the legs and leg prints of our ninja-hero&#39;s do not excite me as much as their torso prints. The bad guy in the set is also a very useful figure. Good to see an open 1/1 round plate to securely attach the hairpiece. LEGO has learnt from previous mistakes: good! The sand-green torso and legs, the brown armour piece, the evil grin on his face, the light grey detailing on his chest and back...my god, this fig is superb! I will love using him in one of my mocs.</p>

<h3>THE BUILD</h3>

<p>The build is easy and straightforward. There aren&#39;t any special techniques used or any surprising usage of pieces. That is not at all a bad thing. Sometimes I feel LEGO makes their builds and models unnecessary complicated, so it is good to see they didn&#39;t do that here.</p>

<p>The final model features a nicely ascending walkway through, what I can only imagine to being a sea of lava. The bright orange plates and transparent&nbsp;orange bricks and plates really&nbsp;do the trick. The use of&nbsp;multiple hinged plates and clip pieces make&nbsp;it possible to give the pathway different lay-outs. I like this transforming feature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pathway lead up to a small cave like stronghold, with prison cell, where we can find the bad guy&#39;s sleeping place, some crystals and gems and a small cooking pot within it the leftovers of, what must have been, a satisfying meal :).</p>

<p>What isn&#39;t immediately visible is that the cave is build around a BURP. I like BURPS (I must be one of the few people that do :D),&nbsp;but it is a shame to see that LEGO used so many pieces to hide the fact that a BURP was used...it feels like a waste of bricks. Bricks that could have been used for different things: more terrain, a nice side build, a second structure to the small stronghold, &hellip; I don&#39;t know, but it feels like a missed opportunity to me.</p>

<p>Oh yeah, did I mention I totally love the green flame pieces?</p>

<p>The colour scheme is pretty consistent, although the random use of black bricks and plates annoy me ever so slightly. I wish LEGO would have stuck&nbsp;to dark and light grey and dark&nbsp;tan.&nbsp;<br />
The biggest eyesore however is the bright red colour of the action feature present in the pathway. I was in the assumption that LEGO had stopped&nbsp;using these annoyingly bright colours for action features and I don&#39;t understand way these tiles aren&#39;t grey or tan? Anyway, it is an easy fix, but still LEGO please STOP, please...sigh....</p>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p>All in all, this set is a decent start to the series. If you only get one set of the new Ninjago wave, it will have to be this one, no doubt!</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-cb8b05e6-7fff-710b-7f31-94726ec1a92a"">Unlike some of the previous waves of Ninjago, the Master of the Mountain subtheme does not contain any kind of &ldquo;minifigure pack set&rdquo;. What I mean by that are sets like <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70591-1/Kryptarium-Prison-Breakout"">70591-1: Kryptarium-Prison-Breakout</a></span> or the more recent <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71708-1/Gamer-s-Market"">71708-1: Gamer&#39;s Market</a>, which contain a large amount of minifigures for the price when compared to sets in a similar price range. The closest thing this wave of Ninjago has to the previously mentioned examples this time around is <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71717-1/Journey-to-the-Skull-Dungeons"">71717-1: Journey to the Skull Dungeons</a>. While it only has four minifigures, that&rsquo;s still a decent amount for $30 and it has a nice looking build to back it up, something which most of the aforementioned minifigure pack sets lack. Since it is relatively cheap and can combine with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71722-1/Skull-Sorcerer-s-Dungeons"">71722-1: Skull Sorcerer&#39;s Dungeons</a> I decided to pick it up.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-cb8b05e6-7fff-710b-7f31-94726ec1a92a"">The Minifigures</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-cb8b05e6-7fff-710b-7f31-94726ec1a92a"">This set features four minifigures, three of which are members of the Wu Cru (that&rsquo;s not still a thing is it?). All three of the Ninja in this set wear silver armor (with the gold armor going to Zane, Cole, and Kai), and I like the asymmetrical design they all feature, that being the one silver arm. Jay looks good on the whole but I feel that his leg printing doesn&rsquo;t match his torso super well, even though they were designed to go together (this is because the line going down his torso&rsquo;s robe is hard to see on his leg print since it&rsquo;s covered by his belt, making the whole thing awkward-looking in my opinion). Lloyd looks pretty good too, although I&rsquo;m not sure why his design is completely new and not based off of his Secrets of the Forbidden Spinjitzu design, which is not the case for the others. It&rsquo;s a minor inconsistency though and I haven&rsquo;t watched the TV show in a while so there may be a reason for this that I&rsquo;m not aware of. Nya is my favorite out of all of the new ninja designs. The tan arm and fur on her suit give her design a more rugged and world-worn design, which looks great. I don&rsquo;t have any real complaints with her suit. Murt also appears in this set. He&rsquo;s the same in this one as in the others, but I think he works great for army building so his frequent appearances aren&rsquo;t an issue in my eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-cb8b05e6-7fff-710b-7f31-94726ec1a92a"">Overall it&rsquo;s a good selection, although I wish that Kai had been included in lieu of Lloyd in either this set or </span><a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71722-1/Skull-Sorcerer-s-Dungeons"">71722-1: Skull Sorcerer&#39;s Dungeons</a> so that you could get the whole ninja team if you purchased both, since now I&rsquo;m only missing Kai but have to spend at least $70 to get a set with him. I could always order him individually of course, but for kids who have no such recourse it is a shame that getting the whole team is harder than it need have been.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-cb8b05e6-7fff-710b-7f31-94726ec1a92a"">The Builds&nbsp;</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-cb8b05e6-7fff-710b-7f31-94726ec1a92a"">This set has only one main build, but does come with another minifigure stand for the game, which I&rsquo;ll briefly mention. It&rsquo;s built identically to the two I already owned, with three golden hearts on clips at the front that can be flipped down to indicate a loss of a character&rsquo;s health when playing the game that uses these sets. I haven&rsquo;t tried out the game yet but the flipping works just fine, as is to be expected. This set also comes with one of the new spinner dice pieces, which I don&rsquo;t really get but looks kind of interesting.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-cb8b05e6-7fff-710b-7f31-94726ec1a92a"">The main build is of course the stone structure that the Ninja are adventuring through. It features a&nbsp; lot of natural looking stone detailing, which comes together to make a nice little dungeon area for the ninja to battle through. The base of the build is decorated with orange pieces to indicate the lava beneath the heroes, making any battle all the more dangerous. There are two play features as well: an exploding piece of the stairs and a working crane for the cage, which one of the ninja can be trapped in to add some tension to the battle. That&rsquo;s really about it, honestly. There is also a small bed in the back of the build for Murt, which is a funny detail, but otherwise what you see is what you get.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-cb8b05e6-7fff-710b-7f31-94726ec1a92a"">Parts and Miscellaneous Thoughts</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-cb8b05e6-7fff-710b-7f31-94726ec1a92a"">If you already own some of the other sets from Master of the Mountain, then most of the unique parts to this wave will already be recognizable to you. These include the new ninja armor and mask pieces, Murt&rsquo;s armor (which is a recolor of the armor used by the Dragon Hunters in the Hunted subtheme), and the Shadow Sword of Deliverance. And there&rsquo;s the Ninja&rsquo;s shields, which aren&rsquo;t new pieces but do have unique printing which looks awesome (not unique to each other but this wave in general). I found the building process was quite straightforward, though it ended up going a bit longer than I had expected. This set does have 401 pieces, so it&rsquo;s quite substantial for $30.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-cb8b05e6-7fff-710b-7f31-94726ec1a92a"">Overall</span></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><span id=""docs-internal-guid-cb8b05e6-7fff-710b-7f31-94726ec1a92a"">Like I said before, what you see is what you get with this set. That said, I think that&rsquo;s perfectly fine. The build looks nice and goes great with the other sets from this wave, but it works nicely as a playset on its own too. The only real gripe I have with this set is that two of the four minifigures included are also in the largest set of this subtheme, which is very much intended to go with this one (I mean they literally have connection points and everything). Two copies of Murt is fine for army building, but Kai instead of Llyod would have been nice to have the whole team. I also wish there was a way to army build the villains of this wave easily, but that&rsquo;s not really a criticism of this set in specific. If you just want a small way to get a taste of this subtheme is this set is perfect for you, and if you care about PPP then this set also is great on that front. It&rsquo;s all around a great little playset.&nbsp;</span></p>

"Green_Bricks","2020-10-03T17:05:59.7Z","A hidden gem amongst the summer 2020 releases","<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">I actually stumbled upon this set by chance; I keep my eye on a few select themes when pictures are leaked every wave, and usually discard the rest, so I had no idea this set existed until it caught my eye on a toy store&rsquo;s online product page. With all that in mind, I nabbed it when it went for 20% off at Argos in the UK recently, during their unprecedented clearance season recently. All I can say is that, especially for the price I paid, it&rsquo;s an amazing set by all metrics, and an absolute bargain.</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">There was quite a lot of variety with this set, with the two main sections being the zigzagging pathway and the clifftop hideaway of sorts. There were quite a few nice orange pieces, including translucent orange for the lava, so opening each new bag was a surprise of its own. There were no ground breaking techniques to find here, but I liked building the rockwork and the stone steps that led up to it. There were minimal stickers, which were mostly related to the board game aspect of this model, so I kept quite a few of them off, leading to a pleasingly non-stressful experience! The only gripe I had was that I couldn&rsquo;t really spread out the building process, which I like to do with my sets, by doing something else in between bags. The set does contain 3 numbered bags, but when I finished bag 2, the model felt quite flimsy, so I felt I had to open up bag 3 to finish off that section, rather than leaving it for an hour or two. That&rsquo;s quite a personal complaint, so I&rsquo;ll let you decide if that ruins the process for you.</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Completed model</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Despite predominantly being a playset, this set looks fantastic. From the desired angle, the rockwork looks fairly realistic for the limited number of pieces the designers were restricted to. Details like the embers heating up a cauldron work well, and the general look of the natural environment is convincing and realistic. The way the lava flows through the gaps in the rocks looks great. My point is that, if you bought this model purely as a display piece, you wouldn&rsquo;t be disappointed. The fact that it functions as a board game is a bonus to someone like me; I don&rsquo;t plan on playing it myself, but who knows, if we go into a second lock down, it&rsquo;s ready and waiting!</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Jay, Lloyd &amp; Nya - the 3 ninjas here look fantastic, and were one of the main things that caught my eye in the first place for this set. Pieces with multiple colours have clear, defined lines between them, and the attention to detail with the chest and shoulder armour is a nice touch. All 3 ninjas have the same, beautiful dragon printed shield (I cannot wait to utilise those in a MOC!), along with double-sided faces with happy and serious expressions (again, great for the MOC builders). Lloyd and Nya both have decent accessories, with a sword and a spear between them, but Jay&rsquo;s flail, or &lsquo;spiky ball on a chain&rsquo; as known by me in the Google search for its name, is fantastic. Overall, the hero minifigures here are incredible, and as someone who has Lloyd as his profile picture on Instagram, it&rsquo;s great to get another version.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Murt - without knowing quite how to explain it, if Murt was a word, it would perfectly describe the appearance of this character. He&rsquo;s like the barbarian of ninjago, with an axe for chopping and a bare, muscled chest for fighting. His facial expression with the 2 teeth poking out is hilarious, and reminds me of my cat! Bricklink tells me that his hair has featured in multiple sets, but it&rsquo;s certainly new to me, and is again perfectly fitting for a brutish villain character. I didn&rsquo;t really give this figure any consideration when I bought this set, but now that I own him, he&rsquo;s definitely one of my favourite minifigures that I&rsquo;ve purchased in a set recently.</span></span></p>

<p><strong>The 3 Ps</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>P</strong>rice - I already spoiled this point, but for &pound;24.99 retail price, this is a bargain in my eyes, and getting it for &pound;20 made it even better. Great price to part ratio, and a fitting volume of stuff in the final product</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong>layability - Having a board game in a LEGO set might be the epitome of playability! Features include a cage to trap minifigures in, which can be raised and lowered with a crank at the back, the exploding rockwork which is triggered by a lever embedded into the rocky steps, and the fact that Murt has his own little bedroom at the back of the set. Lots of potential for play here overall</li>
	<li><b>P</b>arts - the translucent orange and regular orange parts are both welcome inclusions, as are all the dark grey rock pieces (most of my slopes are light grey, so maybe this set will get torn down for parts eventually!). You also get half a dozen 2x2 plates with only one row of studs, which I might also nab for MOCs down the line. You could probably also get some value out of this set as a reseller, as it contains a Big Ugly Rock Piece (which I love because LEGO fans call it a BURP!) along with a very precisely moulded spinner, some lovely green flame pieces, and a beautifully moulded sword which is exclusive to this wave of sets. Lots of value to be seen here</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">I&rsquo;m not even a ninjago fan particularly, and I have plenty of praise for this set. I&rsquo;ve given most aspects of it a 5 in my rating above, which seems a little extreme for such a small set, but realistically, it has very few faults. Obviously, if you&rsquo;re someone who collects direct to consumer sets and displays them proudly in an office behind a glass cabinet front, something this small won&rsquo;t meet your needs, but if you&rsquo;re someone who just wants a break from everything going on in the world and needs to unwind for an hour, this is the perfect set; you get a fun build and a neat little model at the end! Anyway, this is my second review in 2 days, so hopefully I&rsquo;m not pumping out rubbish and you&rsquo;ve enjoyed hearing my thoughts. For now, I&rsquo;m gonna ninjaaaaa-go! and build some more, but I&rsquo;ll probably be back soon.</span></span></p>

"Romans122","2021-03-16T23:19:33.237Z","A Gem in the Ninjago Theme","<p>Ninjago may not be the favorite theme for most older Lego fans, but #71717 Journey to the Skull Dungeons stands out as an exception. This set is creative and features an excellent selection of parts, which makes it a great&nbsp;choice even for those interested in other themes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>I actually found this to be the worst part. The set features 4 minifigures: Hero Lloyd, Hero Jay, Hero Nya, and Murt. The &#39;hero&#39; ninja wear heavy armor&nbsp;and carry shields that are adorned with a fearsome dragon head.&nbsp;This design is nice as a change, but I dislike it&nbsp;since ninja focus on stealth, not armor. Murt is an orc-like native to the underground fiery world. I appreciate his design, but do not like that Lego only included him as a single antagonist. I would have appreciated it if they omitted one of the Ninja for another villain, particularly since all of them appear in other sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The first part of the build involves making&nbsp;several stone platforms that the ninja use to cross a sea of lava. These structures are actually very intricate, and it is obvious that the designer was detail-oriented. On one of the platforms, there is a hidden switch that ejects one of the platforms that the ninja can stand on! This part also has a spider.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next and final two bags create a larger stone structure which is also Murt&#39;s home. Once again there is a lot of attention to detail, and several slop pieces are used to create a realistic rocky facade with lava pouring out. There are a few cool features to point out here:</p>

<p>1. A cage that can be raised or lowered using a winch. I personally found this part a bit more challenging than usual for official Lego products, but the design is realistic and adds a nice play element.</p>

<p>2. The Shadow Blade of Deliverance. A very nicely molded sword that serves as a goal and prize for the ninja.</p>

<p>3. A bed for Murt underneath the rock. It is built similar to Minecraft beds and complements the cauldron well.</p>

<p>4. Another nice little secret which I do not want to spoil in this review.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Board Game</b></p>

<p>This is my only Master of the Mountain set, so I do not have full experience with the board game.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, I did try it and it is nice but not very complex. The set featured a unique die (that resembles the Spinjitzu spinners) and a placemat that can be used for an expanded game or to connect the sets. The player&#39;s movement and attack success is determined&nbsp;by the die, so at this scale the whole game is essentially luck. Nevertheless, I found it to be a great way to expand a set and it is reminiscent of the Heroica theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Journey to the Skull Dungeons an exceptionally good set in the Ninjago theme and a great product for MOC making. The model contains an excellent selection of parts, and I found it simlar to Lord of the Rings and the Fantasy Era castle line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigure selection was a bit disappointing since there is a sole villain to face a trio of ninja, but the designs are still pleasing. With&nbsp;401 pieces it is a great value for $30, and in many stores it is currently on sale (I was actually lucky enough to get it for $21.60).&nbsp;I would recommend this product&nbsp;to anyone looking for a fun set or a great way to economically&nbsp;pick&nbsp;up rocky slope elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
