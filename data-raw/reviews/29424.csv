The set was shown in season 13 of Ninjago. The build itself has a nice aesthetic to it, and the way the curves look works very nicely.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with two Minifigures, which are Hero Wu, and Gleck. while the Wu is a nice exclusive, I think they could&#39;ve made something more of it with all other parts being used before except for the torso, which is new. The geckle in the set is Gleck, which is the cheapest way to get him. i think that the new designs for the Geckle are very nice, using a nice medium lavender for the head, torso, and part of the hat/ear combo. Overall, the Minifigures in the set are good and two nice inclusions.</p>

<h3>The Side Build</h3>

<p>The side build aka; the holder for the ivory blade of deliverance, is a nice small build. There isn&#39;t too much to say here but the addition of the green flames is nice and the orange circular 4x4 plate makes you feel as if it were sitting on lava.</p>

<h3>The Main Build</h3>

<p>The dragon is an overall, good build. The head uses solid pieces such as the roller skate for the mouth of the dragon and the 1x2 jumper tile in the centre for the eyes is a creative way to make the effect&nbsp;for the&nbsp;eyes. The use of the mini ball joint for the tail is very nice, giving you the option to put it however you may like it, same goes for the neck and head. My 2 main issues with this set are the legs and wings. The legs, minor posability is so bad, each time I pick it up to put somewhere els, i end up having to realign the legs (more specifically the feet). I fell as the problem could&#39;ve been easily fixed by using a click hinge instead of the clip hinge. the wings of the dragon are very nice, but the plastic wing material, (at least in my case) are too big and you end up having to bend the plastic a little down or up.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The overall build for 71718 is a solid set. The only thins that I would change is the posability of the feet and legs since there isn&#39;t anything you can do about the wings. I would overall rate the set a B- for the issue with the wings and feet.</p>
