It includes the new <strong>Legacy</strong> (sleeveless) <strong>Lloyd</strong> and his sword. It has three stickers which in my opinion are&nbsp;good but if you&nbsp;don&#39;t like stickers they are pretty crucial to the detail so maybe this set isn&#39;t for you. It&#39;s only feature is the rear suspension which is actually quite fun to play with in my mind. But overall it&#39;s a good set but I&nbsp;would have liked some more minifigs and action features. So out of ten I&nbsp;would give it a seven maybe eight.</p>

The set does appear in season 12 of ninjago. i think the build is a good vehicle and a great example of a buggy in the proper size.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This&nbsp;set comes with one minifigure, legacy 2 Lloyd. The figure comes with a&nbsp;new torso and leg print for 2020. This version of Lloyd uses the 2017 movie face and hair and&nbsp;is meant to represent the tournament robes from the beginning of season 4. I think they did a nice job with trying to represent the robes with adding some finer details. My one issue with the torso print is that the ninjagin writing on the torso says manter instead of master. They later updated Lloyds&#39; in the 71704 Kai fighter.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>After building&nbsp;the set, I think it&#39;s a really nice model for $10. The suspension function works really well with the use of the 2 long rubber technic piece. The angle that the car is in gives it a bolder look, and the green slopes helps the look out. I wouldn&#39;t say the 3 stickers are necessary, but the set looks more complete with them. The control panel is the same one that we got in the original version, since 2015. The cockpit and back of the set really help the set give the buggy look. In the cockpit, there are two reddish brown plates that help the look of a seat. The two 1x1 circular tiles are a nice representation of lights. On the back of the build, there is a 1x2 grill piece that looks like its meant to be the exhaust. There is also a tailgate that i think looks great in the scale that they are going for. The wheels are a nice pearl gold, the smaller version that they&#39;ve used since 2015.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall, 71700 is a very nice set for $10, I would overall rate it an A. I think the minifigure is very nice and the build is very solid with a nice aesthetic and play feature.</p>
