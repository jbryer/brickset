The glass is opened from the front, but just to be able to put precious stones there when they are blocked by a wall of a shop or something from the back. The building itself disappointed me especially in the construction of the car, because the chassis has ready-mounted wheel axles, which in addition are blocked with plastic on a latch, which I did not want to break, and which protrudes in two places at the bottom. The concept of a summer dog car is very cool, but not for the first set. Very cool, figurines cool, but fun to build so-so: D</p>

To be honest I really only got this for the dog figure that it comes with. The actual vehicle is blocky and gives me that nostalgic Lego feel and I can see how it is great for small hands to play with. Because it is built with larger moulded pieces it is wonderfully sturdy and all printed pieces so no fiddly stickers. The inclusion of a little window to rob is a nice touch for gameplay. Number Of Pieces: 67 Approximate Price Per Piece: &pound;0.13 Build Time: 5 Minutes</p>
