<p>Duke DeTain is driving the blue and white police car that is modified like street race car, so he can chase the crooks in LEGO city. While the bandit Vito is driving red car that can speed very fast since he carries a safe filled with money and gold bars.</p>

<p>Beside car, minifigures and safe, this LEGO&reg; set also provides cutaway of pedestrian walk, road sign that marks speed limit and a crate filled with pile of fishes (four fishes to be precise). And of course whenever there is a speeding scene, there will be a risk of accident to happen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Vito finally crashed into the fish crate and stopped by the road sign. Fortunately for him, it seems he only suffers minor injury and Duke DeTain quickly apprehends him. Justice prevails again!</p>

<p>Both minifigures have dual expressions. For Duke DeTain, he has wide smile while wearing sunglasses and the alternate expression is a faint smile without sunglasses. While for Vito, his first expression is serious face with a eye mask while the alternate expression is another serious face without mask. For the torso, Duke DeTain has patterns on both sides. Vito only has a single pattern which is on the front side while the back side does not really have any noticeable pattern.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like usual, this LEGO City vehicles are simple and not as detailed as LEGO Creator 3 in 1 vehicles. But the shape are still interesting for children to play with. The vehicles can also add more variety to your city diorama.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>Building vehicle is always fun especially when you are nearing completion. There is a sense of satisfaction knowing another vehicle will be added into the City diorama.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Part number should be OK. I only wish that there are more parts available to be added for the&nbsp;bottom of the car (there are holes on the bottom of the car, so when the car cross a wet road, water will splash inside). It is not as tightly packed as in the Creator 3 in 1 cars.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Children will definitely enjoy this set for the chasing scene! My son keep playing it over and over until he receives another newer set. For adult, you can set up any scene that involve robbery with this set.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>The value of this set is acceptable for me, since, I am happy with it.</p>

<p><strong>Special Note</strong></p>

<p>Please note that I write this review based on my own LEGO Blog article which is available from:&nbsp;<a href=""https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-set-review-60242-police-highway-arrest"">https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-set-review-60242-police-highway-arrest</a></p>

<p>I hope this insight from me will be useful for all AFOLs out there!</p>
