BUT: It&#39;s a helicopter (which I collect) and I had not bought a new LEGO set in quite some time. So I could not resist. Also, I liked the old sets with magnetic parts, like the old <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Aquazone"">Aquazone</a> from 1995/96 and 1998. But, unlike these, with this model it&#39;s all a little... odd.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Standard parts for a helicopter, big plastic front and back parts (*yawn*), rotors, wheels and so on. Also standard parts for a simple quad, a small car and a bike. Some gear (crowbar, handcufffs, megaphone and diamonds) are also provided. Unfortunately, this set has TOO many stickers...!<br />
The obvious centerpieces of the set are the magnets. The parts are quite large, with the magnetic pieces rattling around inside. The magnetic pull is quite strong, better than with the old magnetic parts I know.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with four minifigures, which is very good for a set this size. The distribution of genders and occupations is clear: a male and female gangster and a male and female cop. Snake Rattler (cool design) and Sam Grizzled (the old guy) are &quot;special&quot; characters who also seem to starr in some kind of TV series. As mentioned before, every figure has some kind of gear going with it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Straightforward, easy, even for the youngest of builders. The overabundance of stickers is a little annoying, though.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>If there is a set, which looks could be described as plain, this is it. The helicopter is a very light build with the magnet dangling around on two quite long chains. The model has no hatches, doors or any other possibility of accessing the interior than removing the cockpit-part. Two parts of gear are attached to the outside. The cockpit has room for two, seated behind each other.<br />
The small car looks rather sportive than sturdy, not really like a pick-up-truck to carry a safe full of diamonds. The safe has two small doors for direct access to the treasures. The two magnets hold together very strongly and so the helicopter can lift the car off the streets (even though the car seems to have quite a similar weight as the chopper...)<br />
The small quad has a VERY simple design, but there is a place to clip some handcuffs to. And the bike looks cool, as always.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While LEGO is making efforts to include new, or in this case, reliable techniques to their new sets, those efforts sometimes turn out to be quite... odd. I like how they brought back the concept of magnetic elements, but the implementation does not really appeal to me.<br />
Obviously, the magnetic parts are the main gimmick of this set, and there is not really anything else to it. But the way they are made, with the rattling pieces inside far too large &quot;bricks&quot; fits with the overall... cheap and simple design of the whole set.<br />
Don&#39;t get me wrong, for small kids it holds quite some fun to play with due to the variety of vehicles. Also, the magnetic pieces might be used for some MOCs, especially the one on top of the safe. Also on the positive side is the fact, that it comes with four minifigures, two of them being &quot;special&quot; ones.<br />
But it has little to no presentation value at all. The build holds no challenges at all. The design is basic as it could be.</p>

<p>So, once again: IF you&#39;re a crack for helicopters, like me, wait for a reasonable discount (30&euro; is WAY overpriced) and get it. It might also be a good gift for new young fans of LEGO. But if you look for something eye-catching to be displayed nicely, look somewhere else.</p>
