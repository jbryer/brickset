<p>As I mentioned in my <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/56050"">review</a> for the 60248 Fire Helicopter Response, I bought this set together with the aforementioned, because I was hyped for the new &quot;flying&quot; helicopters and I love to collect LEGO helicopters altogether. I had to realize that the new concept was a failure. But the LEGO enthusiast in me could not convince myself to send it back. So I gave it a try...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Once again, nothing too special here. The one-part helicopter with the flexible fin in the back and the &quot;flying&quot; rotor blades, ripcord, tyres, and everything for a bulky truck, a flatbed trailer a small ATV and a police bike. A little gear is provided, including handcuffs, roadblocks, a walkie-talkie and a coffee mug.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with four minifigures, which is OK for a set this size, but not enough to justify the prize. We have a male and female police officer and a male and female crook. Two of the figures are &quot;special&quot; ones, the policewoman and the male crook.<br />
Personally, I think a fifth minifigure would be a good addition, since the driver of the truck also serves as the helicopter pilot. I think these two jobs should have been split on two separate figures.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not very challenging, as with most LEGO City models. The (overly detailed) instruction booklets starts with the helicopter, then the bike, followed by the ATV, the truck and the flatbed. There are quite some stickers that have to be applied, but not too much.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>If you did not read my review of the 60248 set mentioned in the beginning, you might wonder, why I&#39;m repeatedly writing of a failure. <strong>The helicopter does not fly.</strong> It&#39;s too heavy. That&#39;s it. The blades attached to the shaft alone do fly nicely, though.<br />
From the overall appearance, this set is not very different from other flatbed trucks, especially the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60183-1/Heavy-Cargo-Transport"">60183 Heavy Cargo Transport</a>, so I&#39;ll take it as an object of comparison.<br />
The amount of parts is almost the same, but the 60183 set is a little longer. Its helicopter is buildable and looks a lot better that the new &quot;flying&quot; helicopter. The tractor of this set here is a lot bulkier and more impressive than the older one. I like the elegant design of the truck&#39;s windows! In the back of the drivers cabin is a small containment cell for one crook and some kind of special computer panel on the other side. The cell door and the whole frame can be torn off the vehicle by the ATV with its chain.<br />
The hinge that holds the trailer is a different type than with most other trucks I knew. I like this design better, because the trailer does not swing left and right freely but still follows the movements of the tractor.<br />
The trailer has more than enough space for the small helicopter and the roadblocks. It also has room for the ripcord and the &quot;launching&quot;-mechanism, which is nice, so they don&#39;t get lost.<br />
The design of the ATV is very convincing and the police bike looks cool, as always.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Soooo... The big question for me was: Does this set still have enough value in playability, design and features to compensate for the terrible helicopter fail? Since the &quot;flying&quot; helicopter was once again the main gimmick of the set, my conclusive answer is no, not quite.<br />
IF this set featured a small, buildable helicopter, it would have been a standard, but still nice set. But only, if it came at a reasonable prize. Once again, I&#39;ll compare it to the 60183 truck and trailer, wich had a retail prize of 30&euro;. This set here has only seven more parts, that being the two minifigures, but has a retail prize of 45&euro;!!! That is WAAAAYYY too much. I got it for 33&euro;, still a lot, but OK.<br />
That being said, this leaves us with a medium-sized set with some cool minifigures, vehicles and a main function that does not function... Well, yeah, no recommendation from my point of view, but maybe still a nice toy for the younger LEGO fans because of the different vehicles and minifigures.</p>
