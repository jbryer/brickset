<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This buggy was likely to complete 3 sets I already got from 2019 fire series (60216, 60217 &amp; 60231), so it was on my list for 2020 ! I was lucky to discover this set under Christmas Tree as an extra gift, which pleased me a lot as it contains a wonderful owl.</p>

<p>The building is very simple, I did it without the instructions.</p>

<p>The buggy is simple and strong to support kid&#39;s effort &#39;to launch and to see what happen against a wall&#39;. The shooter is cool and strongly fixed, even it doesn&#39;t shoot that far and that precisely. I never saw such a vehicle in real life, so it is unrealistic, but fun to play. You can fill the energy raging out the motor and be immediately ready to go for a forest fire fight.</p>

<p>Cool set, which I would recommand with no doubt for a young child. Afol will certainly adore the owl, so go on to help the awardable australian firemen !!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Best regards</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

This is a great addition for the younger who have to pass down the fire from the tree, but I decided on the non-filling water bullets: p And yes, the fire can be shot down because it is on a nice spherical base that beckons sideways. One accurate shot and the fire extinguished! This is not a city vehicle, but it takes fun in the forest to a completely different level.</p>

<p>The fireman has a name because it is a set created based on the fairy tale Lego City Adventures, where Clemmons is one of the characters.</p>

<p>The set itself is quite poor in part in relation to the price. The vehicle is solid and well designed.</p>

<p>This has to be the worst buggy Lego has ever made. The buggy has no detail and the wheels stick out a ton which makes it look like it was made for the 4 juniors theme. It is also incredibly low to the ground (just like cars in the 4 juniors theme) which makes it lose some play value. The buggy can hold on to a fire extinguisher which is a good thing for Clemmens because it&#39;s the only effective way to put out the fire because the water cannon just can&#39;t fire water straight.</p>

<p>Part 2. The figure:</p>

<p>The figure is definitely a cool one. He is named Clemmens. However, you shouldn&#39;t get this set for Clemmens as he is in a Lego magazine which also comes with a quad which is far superior to this set and costs half the price.</p>

<p>Part 3. The bush (I think) and owl:</p>

<p>The owl is definitely a great thing to include in such a cheap set and has great printing. The bush (I think) is very simple and is supposed to catch on fire. Need I say more.</p>

<p>Pros: cool figure and cool owl.</p>

<p>Cons: no detail on the builds, faulty water cannon, bush (I think) has next to no leaves, wheels that stick out and the buggy is very low to the ground.</p>
