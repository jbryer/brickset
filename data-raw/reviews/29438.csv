"Joefish","2020-01-22T18:34:43.863Z","Terrible Failure from LEGO","<p>This set looks nice enough - a slightly larger version of the classic quad buggy that has been karting minifigures around since 1979, and some great detail on those figures too.</p>

<p>Value for money (parts-wise) is not so great - but then this set is all about that new &#39;flying&#39; helicopter component, so how does that fare? In a word, &#39;badly&#39;.</p>

<p>I remember ripcord helicopter toys as a joyful and chaotic hazard to home decor - lunatic devices that shot up to the ceiling on Christmas day and tore down all the streamers strung up the week before. So for the price of an ultra-budget fully controllable drone, what do we get from LEGO?</p>

<p>We get a shambles. We get a nice-looking mini helicopter that seats a minifigure but otherwise bears little relation to LEGO. The runners are four studs apart but don&#39;t grip and there are no studs. And the whole thing is just too heavy. Even as an adult male I can barely manage to pull the cord out fast enough to make the helicopter hop off the launcher and fall to the floor. No child is ever going to make this thing fly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a huge disappointment, and I wonder how anyone could approve this disaster for sale. But then I look at those toppling Duplo gears from last year and the mess that&#39;s been made of the VIP points system, and realise that &#39;det bedste er ikke for godt&#39; has long since been forgotten about. What&#39;s Danish for &#39;Any Old Tat Will Do&#39;?</p>

<p>Since I&#39;ve been collecting LEGO for far more than 25 years now, I can say that I&#39;m quite a devoted fan. So I&#39;ll always try to seek for the best in every set I buy. And that is the ONLY reason, I gave this stupid thing more than one star. Truly, I have never ever been so heavily disappointed by a LEGO set, not even by <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/54604"">General Grievous Combat Speeder</a>. In addition to that, it is way overpriced. But here are the details:</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Standard parts for a small quad, small baseplate and some gear. The helicopter is an interesting new part, the new windshield fits smoothly and tightly. Would have been nice for MOCs - if it worked.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The set comes with three minfigures, which is quite a lot for a set coming at a price below 20&euro;. We have a worker with a welding torch, a simple helicopter pilot and Freya McCloud, who also seems to feature in some kind of TV series. She has a fire extinguisher and a large axe at her disposal. Quite some nice figures - if the set worked.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Very simple, what would you expect from less than 100 parts? But even with that little amount of parts - it should have worked.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Judging by the looks, this is an OK set. The helicopter looks stylish, the quad is quite sturdy, the baseplate-part is simple but fitting and the &quot;ripcord-mechanism&quot;-part has a suitable color scheme for the whole series. The small fires are put on round slide shoe parts, so they can&#39;t be attached to any part of the baseplate.<br />
Now, to address the elephant in the room: the helicopter <strong>DOES NOT FLY</strong>. When the cord is pulled, it does not take off. Only, if you thrust the complete thing upwards while pulling, it makes a small hop and then crashes. (EDIT: If you use only the shaft of the rotor and the rotor itself with the &quot;launch-part&quot;, it flies perfectly...) That&#39;s not how this should work.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>As mentioned in the introduction: a gigantic disappointment and an epic failure. I loved those helicopter-blade toys that would go off when pulling the cord and I can&#39;t remember how many of those I had. Of course, I was thrilled, when I saw that LEGO gave this concept a try, yet, I could not really imagine how this should work out. Well, unfortunately, I was right. It simply doesn&#39;t.<br />
I tried ripping that cord-piece as fast as possible, but the helicopter did not launch. I let my daughter try it and she wasn&#39;t even able to completely pull it in one try. Wasn&#39;t this supposed to be mainly a kid&#39;s toy? Wow. Just wow. And on top of that, this piece of junk comes at a retail price of 20&euro;!!! 21 cent per Piece!?! Are you kidding me?!?! I got it on a discount for 15&euro; and I still feel ripped off.<br />
Well, that&#39;s all too bad, but in addition, I also bought the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60244-1/Police-Helicopter-Transport"">60244 Police Helicopter Transport</a>. I have not unboxed it yet and now I&#39;m wondering if I should just send it back. That&#39;s because I&#39;m sure - it will not work.</p>
