"Minifig290","2019-12-30T22:07:20.757Z","The Perfect City Set","<p>Hello all, today i will be looking at the 2020 LEGO City 60249 Street Sweeper that retails for &pound;8.99/$9.99 that has 89 pieces giving a price per part of 10p/11c. This little set includes a nice little street sweeper a figure and some little accessories.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at this little set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>There is just one figure in this set which is more than fine, the figure is the driver of the sweeper and has an orange construction hoodie and which has a silver stripe printed to represent some reflective features on the jacket. The torso also has some hoodie strings and a hood at the back plus some zip details and a belt all printed onto the torso. He has a pair of unprinted orange legs. His face is just a common smiley face most frequently used in City sets so nothing too exciting, and he just has a dark blue baseball cap which too is fairly common in city sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>To go with the set there are some small accessories. There is a common green bin piece, banana, a brown broom and a dark grey shovel, all of these parts are very common. The banana can be placed into the bin&nbsp;or can be eaten by the figure. Don&#39;t worry about where the shovel and broom go as they can be stored on the sweeper.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Speaking of the sweeper lets look at it, we are going to start with the play features of the build. At the front of the build there are two blue technic gears that are representing some brushes that when the sweeper is moved on a smooth surface they will rotate as the technic pin they are on is fairly loose. On the side of the sweeper there are two blue brush piece that was last used in the LEGO Friends Car Wash set from 2018, these are also rotated when the sweeper is moved on a smooth surface.</p>

<p>The cockpit of the sweeper can only fit the driver and has a backrest, steering wheel that is covered by a large transparent grey windscreen piece. The roof of the cockpit is just a simple small car covering that has a 1x2 trans orange tile for it warning light plus at the front some transparent cheese slops to represent the headlights for the sweeper. At the back of the sweeper there is the vehicles storage area for the rubbish that has some nice 1x4 printed bricks with a recycling logo on which doesn&#39;t make full sense as most things that go in these trucks in real life mostly go to landfill. At the back of the storage area is a hatch that can be opened where you can throw the banana piece into and if you want the extra parts included with the set. Besides this hatch are some 1x1 clip bricks to store the broom and shovel on.</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>Wow, what a set hey, this set is a great detailed packed full and playful little set that will be great for any LEGO City street. It&#39;s nice to see a street sweeper set be released which isn&#39;t within another build, which is the first time in 15 years with the last one being released in 2005.</p>

<p>I recommend this set highly to any LEGO fan, it&#39;s a great stocking gift for Christmas 2020, great for Birthday parties and gifts, great for a treat its just the perfect city set as its packed with play features and detail. At the &pound;9/$10 its very much worth the price.</p>

<p><strong>Pros -</strong> Great play features, perfect price, useful pieces,&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons -</strong> Would have loved a bit more rubbish to clean up</p>

<p>This set is now available the UK LEGO Shop</p>

"MrJay520","2020-02-06T08:26:08.3Z","Excellent Creation and Useful","<p>This Set is very easy to build. I also tested it in my City to see how it feels and even looks. And to me it was very well designed. It almost feels like a real life Street Sweeper. Very well made. Perfect for a 10$ Buy.</p>

"sf1378","2020-09-02T13:28:05.227Z","I got this set FREE from Lego Customer Service","<p>Firstly, I like this set. <strong>60249</strong> harks back somewhat to <strong>LEGOLAND</strong> Town - an era I constantly wish Lego would return wholeheartedly to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I received this set <strong>FREE</strong> from Lego <strong>Customer</strong> <strong>Service</strong> yesterday and built it late in the evening. It&#39;s an easy build in around 15mins. Lego sent it to me following a customer complaint I had made - I was very surprised when they agreed to send this particular set of my choosing. It arrived by DPD Couriers in excellent protective packaging. They even sent me emails from Lego confirming things and DPD texted me to alert me of delivery time.</p>

<p>Back to the set, I like the modern shape and the way all 4 bristles move when pushed along. I was pleasantly surprised that there are NO stickers! I even had my tweezers ready prior to opening the box.</p>

<p>I do wish the box was smaller like the old Town sets of this size. It&#39;s a bit over compensating imho and the quality of the cardboard is very weak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My only other gripe is the quality of the bricks - very much like knock offs with imperfections here and there. Lego quality is slipping since components are now made in Hungary, Mexico, Czech and China - gone are the days of solely made in Denmark, which is a real shame and just adds to global pollution and needless factories everywhere.</p>

<p>I recommend this set. Small, compact. Playable. A lack of other refuse is a shame, like leaves, fish bones, spent paper style cups etc. Lack of space in the rear is a shame too as are the slick wheels? Tyres with treads would be much better but I guess this gives the model lower ground clearance with slicks and helps the brushes move.</p>

<p>The front brushes should have used the black Technic Pins as they are tighter, so the brushes could remain in a &#39;raised&#39; position when not in use. A final gripe is placing the figure in the cab - one has to remove the windscreen to do this. Not a big deal but the design could have been better in execution. I do wish the figure had a classic smiley face - I&#39;m a bit fed up with all these &#39;expressive&#39; faces now. Finally, it&#39;s a shame there&#39;s nowhere to clip the green bin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a mod, rotate the boot lid on the refuse container so the smooth face is on the inside, it helps refuse slide in easily. You could mod further and add a roadworks sign on the rear boot lid too and find a way to store the side brushes on the vehicle when not in use.</p>

<p>I must also thank Lego Customer Service for sending this set to me completely free of charge. I have and will remain critical of modern Lego as a company but sometimes they do get things right - in this instance making a grumpy 42 year old AFOL rather happy.</p>

<p>I hope you liked my review and found it helpful. Thank you for reading it.</p>

"Yoda_to_do_or_do_not","2021-12-30T19:12:14.25Z","Cleaning Up The City Line.","<p>I got this set for my Lego train set shortly after it came out and don&#39;t regret getting it. Let me tell you why.</p>

<p><b>Price&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>At $10, this set is a good deal for anyone, especially for someone with a city layout. It is worth every penny. You don&#39;t even have to apply stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;Build</strong></p>

<p>It should not take more than 6ish minutes, depending on your speed. There is nothing interesting happening, but is pretty easy to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Pieces</strong></p>

<p>There are only a few new parts, including the recycle 1 by 4 brick and the blue scraper part on the bottom middle and the blue gear.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>The minifigure is good, but there is&nbsp;&nbsp;nothing special about it.</p>

<p><strong>Playability vs Display</strong></p>

<p>This set can act as both play and display depending on you purpose. It can be used, alone or in multiples, around you Lego city.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Overall&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>Overall this is a good set if you like city sets or have a display Lego train or city diagram display.&nbsp;</p>

"golfgirly72","2020-05-22T17:31:24.133Z","Every city needs one of these","<p>I haven&#39;t purchased very many vehicles, but when I saw this street sweeper I thought it&#39;d be perfect for my city streets. &nbsp;It&#39;s adorable! &nbsp;I love that when you push it along all of the brushes move as well. &nbsp;Well done, Lego!</p>

"Bogdan501st","2020-06-03T09:55:36.887Z","Cool little set","<p>So I was looking for small sets to order alongside the <em>Stormtrooper&nbsp;Helmet</em>(amazing set by the way, check my review on it) the other day. And I came across this street sweeper. I don&#39;t know, it seemed very cool and appealing. And it was only 45 lei (10.50 dollars). I, as a Star Wars fan, am used to the VERY expensive LEGO sets, so I found it really cheap. So I added it to my cart, ready to place it in my LEGO town.</p>

<p>Yesterday my order arrived and I started with the small set, as I always do. The building experience was cool and the end result was so cute! I&#39;m sure kids will really enjoy this set. Those sweepers on the side&nbsp;are amazing! If I were around 6 years old, I sure I would have got hours of play thanks to those sweepers, that trash can and that compartment in the back.</p>

<p>As I said, it is a cool little set and a fine addition(get the reference?) to my LEGO town.</p>
