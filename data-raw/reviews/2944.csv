"lachlan24","2007-04-30T05:23:35.997Z","Great compact set","This is a good little plane, looks fantastic and has many handy pieces. Not the biggest plane, but its big enough to fit the pilot. Also includes a small storage area. Could do with better guns though.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-11T01:53:49.7Z","Very pleased with Pontoon Plane","This set has hidden compartment for storage. Cool color scheme and the mini fig. is great also. Plenty of accesories for your jungle adventures. A solid set and not too much to own it, if you can find it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-11T01:59:19.78Z","Eh...","I have to say this...it looks cooler in the picture than it really is. Please don't get your hopes up. I feel like a sucker for getting it.

His helmet and goggles are cool, but not worth buying the set for. It's such a small plane, looks weak and my pieces keep falling off of it.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"Rubberducky","2008-04-28T14:12:45.497Z","The perfect adventure plane","Clearly this is the best plane in the series. Not only is there a cool minifig, but the plane itself is so well made. Its a great little biplane and is brilliant to play with. comes with lots of accesories too!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-30T18:16:39.873Z","very neet-o","this set is great i got it for christmas when i was real little. it has spots for all the guys tools and equipment. the guy comes with cool clothe and hat and a little pistol. the plain its self is little but is still worth it. i liike the propelers and the wings, the front of the plain could have been improved and thats a pretty wimpy windsheild. i like this set and im glad  bought it",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-01-13T16:38:15.357Z","My favorite adventurers plane","I like this set, a plane with more things than Bi-wing baron. It have two propellers, dynamites, a weapon, and a minifigure to use it. If you have planes, but no these, want it. It have good playability and it can be mixed easily, to build boats,starships, and other creations. A good options for Adventurers fans.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"BasiltheBatlord","2009-08-23T16:35:18.153Z","Harry Cane's Airplane","This pontoon Bi-plane belongs to Harry Cane, the adventurers pilot. it has a good sized cockpit, twin propellers, racks for Harry's shovel and pick, and a compartment in the back for his pistol and dynamyte. There isn't really a space for his binoculars, but you can't have everything

All in all, this is a great adventure plane. 5/5",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Terzeus","2012-03-02T15:34:26.117Z","Pontoon Plane","<p>At first, you look at this set, and think that there is not really much to tell. But there is actually. Pontoon Plane has a nice &amp; clever design with a good use of only seventy-two pieces, which is one of the surprising things about this set considering its size that fits more expensive sets and not a plane that costs you 6 USD.<br></p><p>You will get a very nice minifgure, useful and interesting parts and one of the best things is the actual building of set. It will take you about 10-15 minutes (or maybe even less, depends on how big fan of lego you are) but it will be definitely worth it plus plane has a very good playability thanks to its refreshing design that reminds me more of moderná sets than the legos from ´99.</p><p>Pontoon Plane is my third favorite from TOP 3 Jungle theme sets from Adventurers and is definitely good for every age. The smallest can play with it forever, teenagers like me will just like it and adults certainly find it good in its clever contruction and purpose. Only thing that matters to me is that experienced builders of lego will build it in a very short time but that is not a reason to put it a 4/5 instead of 5/5.<br></p>
<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Nice minifigure to your collection<br></li><li>Clever and interesting design<br></li><li>Fun build</li><li>Endless playability</li></ul><p></p><h4>Cons<br></h4>
<ul><li>Length of actual building is not very long<br></li></ul>
<p>Verdict: Very good set with a lot of useful parts and a clever design that makes it really special among other Adventurers sets.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"AETerry","2010-11-19T00:13:38.307Z","Plane Review","<p>Some days I look at this set and wonder why did I pick it up? It must have been an after thought on my part or that I was thinking I'd try to pick up more sets from the Adventurers theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plane is an okay build. I'm just not that into Lego Airplanes.. or least this one, the coloring or something about it's slightly bulky build got me.</p>",TRUE,3,4,2,3,4
