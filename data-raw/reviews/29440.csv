A set like this reminded me of the Lego sets of my youth. The old Legoland town range of sets from lego used to be plain and simple and relatively cheap. Sets that gave you a simple car build or a Truck build and a minifigure or those little accessory packs that had a selection of figures or city road signs.</p>

<p>This set in 2020 reminds me of those. What you see is what you get. Here we have simple build for a mail delivery plane with 1 minifigure and a small letterbox build to the side. Its the simplicity that I like here. The plane is a nice scale, has&nbsp;easy access&nbsp; to the cockpit for the figure and has a couple of mail box containers to carry the mail. Nice colour scheme of yellow and red that Lego has used for mail delivery themed builds before.</p>

<p>The small highlights to me is the inclusion of 2 printed tiles with different printing for letters, the small bird/dove and the printed tail piece on the plain with the mail delivery logo. I would personally like to see more mail/postal service vehicles and sets in lego as they seem few and far between compared to the large amount of police and fire brigade sets Lego produces. Great little set for the kids and ok for adults if planes&nbsp;or the postal service theme appeals.</p>
