Durable strong connections that withstand the worst off-road conditions. He drives forward, backward, and even up. He will come under every piece of furniture and finally get on it. Although you can&#39;t see any multi-link chassis, the car is well cushioned and behaves terribly realistically on a hard surface of a tile or table. Generally a great car.</p>

<p>The monster truck is ya know. Monster styled. It has eyes and a nose on the hood and the front has teeth. The side has nothing going on and the back has two exhausts and a gap unfortunately. The truck bed has more teeth. The monster truck also has great ground clearance but no suspension.</p>

<p>Part 2. the figure.</p>

<p>The figure is unnamed and has an exclusive torso print. also I&#39;m pretty sure his lime legs our uncommon.</p>

<p>Pros.</p>

<p>Exclusive prints,rare parts and great playability.</p>

<p>Cons.</p>

<p>Gaps in the rear.</p>
