The Crane actually has a multi-purpose for it.s options it gives. However, for those who &quot;Build Cities&quot; like I do, this type of Set, the Crane will become obsolete the majority of the time. My City builds are always &quot;time lapsed&quot;. So once a structure is finished, my use for it can be small.&nbsp;<br />
However, the other two (the Vehicle and Cement Mixer) can be well used in a Normal City &amp; Expert City Build. I also think the Cones are a bit too big. (easy fix for me)<br />
<br />
Overall the Building was very simple. But overall, this feels more like a 10$ set than a 20$ set.</p>
