The truck has lots of kinds of ice cream in it. I like how the window slides open. I like the stickers on this set but I wish that they were printed instead. I also like the ice cream guy on the top of the truck. This is worth the price it costs. This is one of the best sets in my opinion and if I make a city MOC I will put this set in it.</p>

<p>For decades, Lego citizens did not have proper dining locations and only small-scale, unrealistic restaurants, an issue endemic until the Creator Expert line was released. However, the perennial Lego theme, City, still lacked dining options. 60253 is a Great Vehicle and promises a fairly spacious, colourful looking ice cream truck that bears more than a striking resemblance to the Pizza Van, one of the all-time best Lego City sets and Great Vehicles. But how does this set stack up?</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>With a build comprised of mostly studs-on-top construction, 60253 should be simple even for its younger audiences. However, there are brief moments of SNOT, and clever hinged designs for one side of the ice-cream van, which is ingenious. The design of the other side also allows to slide the window when retailing, and is tremendously clever.</p>

<p>Most of the build will focus on the exterior of the ice cream van, which is colourful and attractive, although too many studs are exposed at the roof. However, that is&nbsp;redeemed by its pretty signage. The sides of the van are also well designed, with one with a hinged design and can be easily slide open, allowing access.&nbsp;The other&nbsp;side has two windows, including one that slides open, presumably to proffer the ice cream to the customer. Such features shows attention to detail and swooshability, making the vehicle realistic. The back has a sticker showing &lsquo;Mind the Child&rsquo;, and stickers are also used to create menus of the ice creams on offer. There is also a clever sticker &#39;Only the best&#39; at the side, making a clever pun to Lego.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The interior of the build is constructed along with the exterior (almost simultaneously), and&nbsp;has plenty of space for Minifigures to be placed inside. There is room for two at the back, which also has ice creams on shelves. The inferior part is, however, the refrigerator, which is basically just 1 by 2 blue sinks, which, with no studs to display. There is also a cash register, with ATM and a $100 bill (ice cream for this amount is a bit too much, isn&rsquo;t it?).</p>

<p>The front of the car is accordingly simple, with no real decorations except a wheel and a control pad. There is a small door at each side, providing an idea of access, although Minifigures still cannot realistically get in the van. Furthermore, it is unclear how they move from the front to the back, considering that the pathway is obstructed by the ATM.&nbsp;Nevertheless, it is better than other vehicles with limited suggestions of accessing the interior, and hence I am reasonably satisfied.</p>

<p><strong>Pieces and Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Despite the pieces mainly being fairly generic and that most of the finer details are attributed from stickers, the set offers a pleasing - if unspectacular- piece selection for the price, and the white and glass pieces are great for MOCs. The set also comes with two Minifigures, one worker in the van and the other equipped&nbsp;with a scooter and ready to purchase the ice cream accompanied by a dog. The Minifigures are not top-notch, although they are typical among City sets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>City sets often sacrifice realism and buildability for playability, and fortunately that is not the case for this set, which combines those two reasonably well. However, there are&nbsp;problems with playability. Older children and adults will inherently struggle to pose figures into the van (which is irksome), but also a substantial&nbsp;flaw would be that the two icy poles placed inside the &#39;freezers&#39; (which are extremely unrealistic) would move upon a small shake. This is vexatious, and Minifigures can technically hold those, but given the plethora of accessories I doubt they can.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Value for Money</b></p>

<p>In Australia, 60253 retails for $29.99 dollars, and in the USA the price is at $19.99 dollars. Is the set worth the price?&nbsp;For me, it does. The substantial interior, the colourful, blocky exterior and good selection of parts and Minifigures inexplicably help, and,&nbsp;coupled with a good price to part ratio (10c in USA, 15c in Australia), make this set one of satisfactory value.</p>

<p><strong>Final Verdict</strong></p>

<p>City sets have had a poor to mediocre track record for me due to being overpriced and poorly detailed compared to previous ones, but 60253 is a standout in this wave. Ultimately, the set is marred by realism and playability issues but those can not detract from a colourful exterior, spacious interior, and satisfactory value for money- and I would hence recommend this set.</p>

<p>Rating: 75/100</p>
