<p>My 6yo daughter and I like to build LEGO together, and this was a nice shared building experience. Generally she found it easy enough to manage, although she has some difficultly with the smaller parts. They are each built around a chassis part, in line with the 5+ rating, and follow a slightly simplified construction compared to, say, the 6-wide Speed Champions cars. The final models are solid, apart from the rear wing on the red car, which I removed after having to replace it one too many times. (I also took off the big scoop and replaced it with a tile, mainly because the driver can&#39;t see to driver!)</p>

<p>The parts are nicely optimised to provide single colours for each piece, making it harder for mistakes in the build. Nothing too fancy, and certainly nothing that would really entice an AFOL specifically.</p>

<p>These score well on the playability. They run really well on a hard floor, and my daughter and I often sit opposite each other racing them back and forth to each other. The solid build shows up well when they are crashed into walls/furniture/each other, rarely with a piece detaching. Just what I want from cars for kids.</p>

<p>Considering there are 2 minifigs and few very small parts, the price is reasonable and certainly on a price per play time basis they score very highly.</p>
