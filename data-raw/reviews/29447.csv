"one79","2021-03-01T16:48:35.14Z","More Service Station!","<p>Last year when I saw this product at the news launching, I instantly became interested to get it. Why? Because LEGO&reg; City theme always release police or fire department theme regularly several times in a year. It is different with the petrol station theme that only released every few years (based on the track record). And the last set with the petrol station theme is released on 2016 which is set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60132-1/Service-Station"">60132 (Service Station)</a> which coincidentally using the same set name. So I quickly bought the set without waiting for a discount like what I usually do.</p>

<p>This set has a smaller box size compared to set 60132. The amount of parts is also less (354 pcs vs 515 pcs). Seems this set is more focusing into a simple build. But this set provides 4 minifigures which is the same amount with set 60132! This set also provides two vehicles. Whereas, set like this usually only provides 3 minifigures and 1 vehicle at the maximum. This set consists of 4 minifigures, petrol station, small convenience store and charging station for electric cars.</p>

<p>We can notice straight away that this set is prioritising simplicity. The petrol station is small with modern concept. The pump stations are covered by glass canopy. And on the convenience store, there is a solar panel to help supply electricity to the store or assists the electrical car charging point. The interior of the store is simple (as usual) with cashier that sells hotdog and newspaper. There is a coffee machine that provides beverage for customer to quench their thirst.</p>

<p>The minifigures provided are a service station attendee and three customers: a posh lady with a sport car and two hippie youngsters that intent to travel to the beach with their van. The cars in this set are simple as normally the vehicle from CITY theme. But it is worth to mention that the van has an interesting sticker to reflect the personality of its owner.&nbsp;An interesting set indeed!</p>
