The Tuning Workshop is a prime example of this. If you&#39;re looking for a way to experience&nbsp;these newer and more stylised city sets then this example couldn&#39;t be more perfect. The vehicles of the set are simple builds that remind of other recent vehicles all with their own simple and unique twists. None of these vehicles are difficult builds and have great features for both builders and those who will play with the set. The star of the show however is the garage. We&#39;ve experienced a lack of buildings from City recently, but the garage provides a breath of fresh air. It&#39;s an easy but very enjoyable build that really brings the set together. The part of this set that lacks to most though is that of the used car trailer. It feels out of place for the set and doesn&#39;t connect with any other part of the set. I personally feel as though it could have been left out. For the value of $100 (USD) I feel that this set encompasses many parts of the newer city waves and does it in a good package.&nbsp;</p>
