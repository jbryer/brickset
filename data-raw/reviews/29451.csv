<p>LEGO CITY Airport #60262 is a set that has been released on June 1st 2020. It is a very cool set that has a car-carrier&nbsp;to pull out to the cargo compartment at the back of the aeroplane. Also, it has 9 Minifigures. It includes a control tower as well.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The car-carrier has a loading stationary holder for the car, which will be one of the cargos in the aeroplane. The car-carrier has one Minifigure, the driver, who would carry the car and load onto the aeroplane.</p>

<p>The control tower and the airport terminal itself is too small for itself to be called as an airport terminal. It is instead an airport, which has departure and arrival times on a board hanging on the one-sided wall of the airport. The control tower is on top of the airport, which has to have a figure controlling and viewing the entire airport around. Just a new style that you would see on the airport is a roller coaster track used as its new use of design, which would have never seen in any other airport sets.</p>

<p>The aeroplane features a very good shape and size as well as very good details. The cockpit has controls and levers which the pilot could use and some consoles and other important variated&nbsp;controls used to fly the plane. There are two seats which are for both pilot and copilot. The passenger compartment is a very comfortable section of the aeroplane, where there are seats for passengers. Behind the passenger seating, there is a small little door which leads to the toilet towards the back of the plane. The end of the plane is where there is the cargo compartment, where the car is loaded by its carrier-car. The door opens and I does do the trick.</p>

<p>The smallest of all is the staircase set which would lead to the plane.</p>

<p>The minifigures are:</p>

<p>The pilot</p>

<p>The driver for the car-carrier</p>

<p>The airport workers</p>

<p>The control tower employee</p>

<p>A few passengers</p>

<p>Overall, the whole set is very awesome and very cool.</p>

<p>It is very surprising and very impressive to see.</p>

<p>I would say,&#39;&#39; What if the airport terminal was a bit bigger to fit within the scale to the Aeroplane&quot;&quot;?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Most AFOLs will dismiss this plane because of the one piece wings. But I think a regular plate build will be too heavy and difficult to attach securely to the body without compromising the interior space. The wing piece is quite flexible making the whole plane more resilient to crash landings. A landing that you can drive away is a good landing :-)</p>

<p>There are some stickers, but the most critical pieces are printed: plane door, cockpit panels, engine fans and the vertical rudder. Actually, the plane colours are excellent and look good without any sticker.</p>

<p>The set is split in four independent builds, each with its own printed manual (enjoy them while they last) and piece bags: car, terminal, service cart and plane (with stairs).</p>

<p>Most of the plane has a playable interior accessible by removing the roof: cockpit, seat section, service section (with toilet, food cart and luggage stowing). The cockpit roof attachment can be improved by switching a few pieces (half of the time the roof is removed you also got the plane TV screen). Also, the toilet is quite difficult to access, just like in real life. It can be improved by enlarging the removable roof (just 4 technic pins and 3 1x1 plates from your spare collection). There is also a large cargo section for the car, but kids will find other uses for it. My daughter puts there her favourite stuffed unicorn.</p>

<p>The car is four studs wide and l love this return to the classic size. The service cart is more than adequate. While the terminal is a bit small, gets the job done. It reminds me of some remote airports I visited that have terminals smaller than the plane you are boarding.</p>

<p>The play features are top-notch, with all you need to recreate the now ancient experience of flying, including but not limited to: motion sick passenger, crying baby and demanding celebrity.</p>

<p>While the plane has a small number of pieces it is larger than the typical set for its price. And the parts seem very useful for building similar aircrafts.</p>
