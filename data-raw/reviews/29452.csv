"Sobel","2020-08-18T21:07:27.963Z","Simple, yet good little set for the youngest of explorers!","<p>Now, after treating myself to all three other sets of this sub-series, I also got me this tiny 4+-set, something I usually do not buy. But, for the sake of completion, you know...<br />
Of course, I can&#39;t rate this set the same way I&#39;d rate standard LEGO sets, since this one here is made for little builders in particular. So I&#39;ll put more focus on how it would appeal to a kid.&nbsp;Not really a problem, since I have two of those, one being the exact age, this set was designed for!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Despite containing only around 40 parts, there are some nice ones to it. The main part of the sub is one large yellow piece I&#39;ve never seen before, might have been created especially for this set!(?) Furthermore, you get a large transparent dome-shaped window, a treasure chest with a few gems and some sea weed. Not too shabby!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There is one minifigure included, obviously, and a cool-looking hammerhead shark. That&#39;s quite good for a tiny set below 10&euro;!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>With this set being designed for the youngest builders especially, the build is very, very easy. The only part, where little LEGO enthusiasts might need help are the two arms with their strong joints. A grown-up can do everything in less than 5 minutes.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The tiny sub has a compact, flat shape with two very flexible manipulators with small claws at the end. The pilot has a roomy cockpit with a large window, which can be opened, for a good panorama view. Unfortunately, he has, again, no controls whatsoever. In the back are two small propellers for good underwater speed.<br />
The treasure chest contains two gems, I put the two spare ones in there, too.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>While I was preoccupied with this series as a whole and it&#39;s realism and everything, I started reading Wikipedia articles about deep sea exploration, submarines and bathyscaphs. Interestingly, some real-life subs look a lot like this simple model! So even this tiny little thing packs quite some realism in design. For a kid, it has enough functions to give fun and some good playtime. The flexible arms can grab hold of the gems or the whole chest and the shark and the patch of sea floor with the plant make the set look even more realistic.<br />
Quite a negative point to me was the complete lack of controls in the cockpit. Would it have been too much to add two levers, one to each side of the pilot? Seems so. Also, the cockpit window does not seal the room completely. I guess it would have been better to place it a little lower, so it fitted the whole opening.<br />
Nevertheless, this is still a nice gift-set for a beginning LEGO adventurer, maybe something to go into the &quot;Schult&uuml;te&quot;, for our German brickset.com readers!</p>

"graymattr","2021-03-17T15:51:37.313Z","Hammerhead vs Sub!","<p>As an adult fan of LEGO, I got this set solely for the new hammerhead shark while everything else is a bonus.&nbsp; Having three boys of my own who loved watching nature shows on tv and exploring nature themselves, I&#39;m going to review this for the intended target audience.</p>

<p><strong>The Mini-Submarine</strong></p>

<p>This mini-submarine is actually fun for kids to play with since it has nice features such as two spinning propellers, two movable arms, and a fantastic dome window that opens and closes.&nbsp; Because the main body of the sub is a single piece, it&#39;s really sturdy and will handle some rough treatment by the user but it&#39;s not as engaging to build as some of the old Divers theme mini-subs were like in set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/1782-1/Discovery-Station"">1782 Discovery Station</a> or <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6441-1/Deep-Sea-Refuge""><span>6441 </span> Deep Sea Refuge</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The minifigure included in this set is good for kids and maybe just &quot;okay&quot; for adults.&nbsp; He doesn&#39;t have a diving suit print but is fastened into his seatbelt with printed belts crossing his front and back torso.&nbsp; The new style of baseball cap is nice though.&nbsp; His head has printing on just one side, so no alternate face for when he encounters anything in the depths of the sea.</p>

<p>The hammerhead shark has a great new mold for the head piece that connects to the standard shark 6x9 body.&nbsp; The head has eyes printed on both sides for a nice touch of realism.&nbsp; He makes a fantastic addition to any kid&#39;s collection of LEGO animals.&nbsp; I&#39;m always happy for more animal pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>I appreciate that this set includes a sunken treasure chest to hold the gems.&nbsp; Although set pictures only show two gems, my package included four - two of each color.&nbsp; Kids can use their imaginations and fill the chest with other treasure they want to search for.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This set is priced so low that it is a fair deal, although I waited for it to be included on sale at Target.&nbsp; The building process is short so I didn&#39;t rate that high but is expected in sets this size.&nbsp; Despite the giant yellow piece that makes up the sub body, this set has just enough pieces to add some nice features and better appearance of the mini-sub.&nbsp; The imaginative play factor is definitely there for kids so that boosted my ratings.&nbsp; I would definitely recommend this set for kids and adults that want animals.</p>
