So I waited for some reasonable discounts and got me all four sets of this series. This rather small submarine is about 30&euro; in standard retail, I got it for less than 20&euro;, which is a fair price.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are some interesting parts to this set, some were even new to me. These were the underwater plants, the transparent TECHNIC bar and the glowing angler fish. Other good parts are the four propellers, the roof parts, the large clear window and the two crabs.<br />
What I&#39;d also like to mention is the nicely designed box with lots of details on it.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>There are four minifigures in this set, which is an incredible number for a rather small-to-medium set! We have a male and a female diver in heavy diving gear (which is the same gear as all the explorers use in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Atlantis"">Atlantis </a>series from 2010/11) with a lot of accessories. These include an underwater camera, a metal detector, a flashlight and a remote for the ROV. The other two minifigures are a male and female pilot/scientist&nbsp;for the submarine.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The instructions are separated in three (!?) booklets, with the first one covering the divers and the ROV, the second one the large rock and the third one the sub itself. Every step is VERY simple, so even the most unexperienced builder should have no problem with the build. Bottom to top, and only a small sticker sheet make this build a thing of 20 minutes without haste.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>As with most current City sets, this one also consists of several individual parts.<br />
The small rover has a simple, but sturdy design with an openable box as its center part.<br />
The underwater rocks have a nice colour scheme and the seaweed gives the whole thing a good, realistic touch. There are two crystals hidden in small chasms of the rock, one being covered by some seaweed. The pop-out function of the anglerfish works so-so, because the long transparent bar tips down, when pulled all the way to the back. This can lead to the fish getting stuck.<br />
The submarine has a very realistic design to it, not very good-looking, but realistic. The large, dome-shaped front window ensures a good 180&deg; underwater view. There are two claws for picking up stuff and four large propellers for adequate propulsion. Roof-mounted spotlights and two large air tanks complete the design. The large roof can be completely removed for easier access. In the back of the sub is a large opening with two clips to attach the ROV to. Unfortunately, this opening has NO hatch, door or something and it goes all the way through the entire sub! WTF???</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Potential, potential, so difficult to create, so easy to waste... Now this set is a perfect example for this. The whole realistic-looking submarine-theme fits very well with LEGO&#39;s recent program, promoting science and Tech, as did its predecessor, the mars-exploration series.<br />
Now, bringing together a cool design and realistic looks is quite the challenge, for sure! LEGO has done quite a good job in recent times in doing so. The same goes for this set, the colour scheme of the sub, ROV and underwater rock are on-point, the design of the sub might seem odd, but again, the realism is the main point of this series. The recycling of the Atlantis-diver suits is a nice reminiscence of older days and the abundance of minifigures is also a bonus.<br />
Now, why did I give only three stars? Again, 3.5 would have been better, because this set has indeed some good points, but it has at least one HUGE negative one. As I pointed out above, the opening in the back of the sub, where the ROV can be attached, is completely open to the interior of the boat. There is no way to close it! There is not even some sort of wall, window or separation of any kind inside the sub. So basically, when this thing goes down, it won&#39;t go up again! Again, a great example for the laziness/incompetence/stinginess of the LEGO designers! Why not make the sub one or two studs longer and add a transparent wall inside to separate the ROV hangar from the crew&#39;s seats? Why not??? If such a flaw happens with a car-set or&nbsp;even a plane/helicopter-set, I can part with it. But with a submarine?? And in such an obvious way??? Naw. This is just too plain cheap.<br />
So, for younger kids, who do not really care for design and just want to build and play, this is a very good set. But for older kids or AFOLs... not so much.</p>

"JayTheNinja19","2020-10-31T09:37:33.643Z","Ocean Exploration Submarine-A good, but not perfect return to the underwater sub-theme","<p>When I started collecting LEGO with my sisters 13 years ago, we exclusively collected City sets. We then branched off, and since 2012 I haven&#39;t collected a single City set larger than a Polybag. So, this review is a way of&nbsp;judging&nbsp;how good the set is in itself, and also,&nbsp;for me, to see how far the&nbsp;theme has come in 8 years. Anyway, enough backstory, time to get into the set.</p>

<p>Firstly, the Minifigs. The set comes with 2 Deep Sea Divers, one &quot;Explorer&quot; and 1 named character, Jessica Sharpe, who I believe is featured in the LEGO City Adventures show. The quality of prints is quite high, with 4 different facial expressions, and the torsos all have detailed printing. There isn&#39;t any side printing but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessary for this set. 3 of the 4 Minifigs have leg printing, and it&#39;s fascinating to me to see how detailed City Minifigures now are. The two Divers have dual facial expressions, showing both&nbsp;happy, and rather scared&nbsp;expressions, . As far as I&#39;m aware, only one of the 4 heads is&nbsp;new, but there&#39;s enough variation across the Minifigs to make them feel unique.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, onto the builds. The rock face is of a nice size, and looks pleasant with some nice colours, and those rather new plant pieces. Probably the main draw to this build is the play feature, which is very simple. The angler fish simply sits in the crevice in the rock, and can be pushed out using a large, clear Technic beam. It&#39;s a fun feature, but to me it makes it a bit hard to display on a shelf&nbsp;without pushing the fish outwards, which looks a&nbsp;bit weird. The Submarine is a simple build, but works well. The level of detail is good, and my main&nbsp;complaint is that it&#39;s open at the back. I know it&#39;d be difficult to correct that for the size, but it&#39;s something that slightly bothers me. The feature of the 2 claws works well, and there&#39;s no worry of the rubber bands snapping. The top needs to be removed to place the driver in the cockpit. The only other problem for me is that the other driver just sits in the back, and moves around a bit during play, with no studs to hold him in place. A small vehicle is included, which can easily clip onto the main submarine, and this&nbsp;is what prevents the rear-driver from falling over.</p>

<p>Lastly, two red crabs are included, and the Anglerfish is glow-in-the-dark. It&#39;s power is surprisingly powerful, and lasts much longer than anticipated. I remember going to bed&nbsp;last night, and seeing it glowing brightly somewhere on the shelf, despite not being exposed to much light.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this is&nbsp;a good set. An easy, but fun build, with great Minifigures. The builds are not without fault, but do well for what they&#39;re meant to be. The colour scheme is also nice and fresh, with some bright classic colours, and some more subtle, interesting colours. Although the set in itself would score 8/10 for me, the value is a problem. In my country, South Africa, the set&#39;s price is equivalent to $33.85, which is a little more expensive than I think it should be. If the set were $30, I&#39;d say the price is perfect, however, seeing that the US price is $39.99 is disappointing. It&#39;s a great set, but if I were in the US,&nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t fork over nearly $40 dollars to get it. I thought I&#39;d mention that I received this set for free from LEGO South Africa, but I wanted to give a fair and honest view on the price, which I think is far too expensive in the US, but seems to be good in most other parts of the world. I&#39;d say that the &quot;American Score&quot; would be 6/10, whereas&nbsp;my verdict based on the more reasonable prices found elsewhere would be 7-8/10.</p>
