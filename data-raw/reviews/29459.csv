<p>I have actually no clue why LEGO decided to overprice this set in the US but&nbsp;I am very much Glad they did not do that when pricing in SGD</p>

<p>After building this set, I realised that the set was actually bigger than I thought! The helicopter was well sized (more value than 10$) and I loved the colour scheme&nbsp;</p>

<p>The addition of the lighthouse was unnecessary but very welcome. I liked how you could hide the crook&rsquo;s stolen treasure inside. The shark and the fish also added to the playability as the LEGO shark is able to swallow the fish entirely!</p>

<p>The raft was an interesting build with space to hold treasure and even a tiny engine! I also like the amount of treasure included in this set as imo it&rsquo;s pretty generous</p>

<p>The mini figures in this set are very detailed and cool. Love the design of the sky police!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this set is awesome for its price everywhere except in North America and I totallly recommend it</p>
