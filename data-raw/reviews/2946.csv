"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-06T19:52:02Z","Best Mini fig scale Bi-Plane ever...","This was simply great. A nice set, and it looks very 1930s. I love it. The construction was great, and takes longer than expected for the price it had been selling for.
There are four guns on the plane, and I like the propeller construction.(the things behind the propeller)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"latias93","2006-05-28T09:01:22Z","Oh man did I drool for it.","I got this set when I was 5 at a Lego Warehouse Sale. I was looking thru all the Lego sets. Some looked nice, but expensive. My mum said &quot;How about a nice cheap Lego Set that you REALLY like with high playability?&quot;
I didnt really know what she meant, but just follwed her into the &quot;CHEAP &amp; SMALL SETS FOR STARTERS BOOTH&quot; and I grabbed one of the few Bi-Wing Baron planes. Man, I drooled looking at it when my mum was at the long queue at the cashier.....*flashback 8 years ago*",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"ratz","2007-08-13T04:49:37.05Z","exo-force of the 20's","the overall good design of this set has been praised rightfully, but was it necessary to mount 4 rifles on that plane, two of which not even could have been fired by the pilot (how is he supposed to reach for the planes wings, eh?).
perhaps we encounter here the beginning of lego's tendency towards ridiculously heavy armed vehicles - just look at this years exo force stuff, of which most sets consist of just huge weapons, steered and operated by humanoids. i do not appreciate this at all.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-05-07T11:35:27.81Z","Rat-a-tat-tat","Despite the small size, the design on this WW2-esque plane is magnificient.  The big hard non-pneumatic wheels, the large wings, the mounted shotguns and the cockpit area all excellently designed, but it is the design of the propeller assembly which takes the cake.  The details of the front include the four cylinders of the propeller engine.  The overall colour isn't too attractive, but it is true to the details of the period.  The binoculars and map as accessories just shows the amount of thought put into this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-30T14:30:24.513Z","great","i like the biplane and the motor is realy cool, it is realy fun to play with and includes some old rifles. the wheels on the bottom are cool, and i like the bottom of the plane, it is made up of one useful peice. this set is good for little kids to play with and bigger kids to make. i would recomend this set to people just starting lego",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"GuitarGod_Dave","2007-12-28T16:16:38.39Z","1 of the best planes ever","I got this set &amp; fell in love with it. It is a great plane with 4 guns on it. A olde school plane. 1920's/30's plane. Looks really cool. A good looking plane. Really detailed &amp; makes it a perfect fighter plane.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-01-13T11:45:55.81Z","Classic bi-plane","This is one of my planes of the adventurers sets. I have used the two promo sets to upgrade it. Now, some pieces are used in space creations. The wings are great and the propeller too, these things can be used to various creaton themes.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Legobuilderguy","2008-06-23T23:45:15.937Z","A Classic find","Bought this one off E-bay and was suprised when I had it all put together. This is a bit off scale of the other Lego style planes that I own but that's not really a problem, the problem is the lack of a rear landing gear. How is it supposed to land and take off? Not really a problem but I was suprised to see that I had the parts to build a second one in my bins. Now, I did not add the rifles as shown but used the black light swords (shop at homes description not mine) for the guns and I think it looks better. If you can find this one I say buy but don't spend too much on it. Later",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"rabk295","2008-07-19T06:31:38.403Z","I STILL Love The Oldies!","This is a great set in my eyes. I noticed some people saying that the two top guns are not reachable, but that is ok, because the steering wheel probably has a trigger that fires all of the guns. I think this is a really superb set
and I especially love the back piece which I use on my other WW1/WW2 planes. I Think this set is a fantastic set that is really fun to play with.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"asianlego","2008-09-25T09:18:37.233Z","Just like Sopwith Camel","The plane as many others would tell you resembles those common in 1920's and is actually very nicely detailed here. It contains the villain minifig who apparently dropped his treasure map as every side of the box would show you. The dualstack wings are propped with a single brick which looks very flimsy but it amazingly supports with full strenght. The front rotor propeller is the best part of the plane as it is wonderfully detailed. There is nothing much to the rear of the plane except that there are to pockets for two treasure maps. The plane is also ready for combat in the sand dunes as it has four guns. Yes, FOUR guns! Two on each wing! I recommend you to get this set as it is one of the best aviation sets ever produced.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-29T10:04:42.063Z","LEGO Adventurers (Desert) - Bi-Wing Baron Review","This biplane looks cool - and it is cool. I love the way how LEGO did the propellor in the front which sviwels full 360Â° and the rifles on the top of the wings. This is an easy build and fun to play with. It also comes with a map which you can hide in your cockpit where the minifigure - Sam Sinister can control the plane. The figure looks really cool and he also has a black binoculars. It's great little set and it's worth the money for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"J__B_","2010-10-30T18:27:29.55Z","Classic","This has some great pieces, and some great design techniques. The propeller design/pieces is one of the best I've seen. The wings are very useful (especially since you get 4) although the tailpiece I haven't used much. Good to round out this plane, though. The hull/cockpit piece has space to stick maps and other accessories.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"clundsberg","2011-05-04T22:30:00.25Z","Score One for the Baron!","<p>You can almost&nbsp;feel the speed of this plane and hear the roar of the engine as it swoops down on the front of the box.</p>
<p>More lego sets like this please!&nbsp; It's realistic, a fun build, a very cool retro-vehicle, great colour scheme, great mini-fig, nicely detailed and for all you sticker-haters - thar be none!</p>
<p>I gave this set a straight up 5/5 for the above reasons.</p>
<p>Want more? OK!</p>
<p>This plane is a great size - not too big and not too small.&nbsp; Not so many pre-fabricated/molded pieces make for high useability with other designs in contrast to the more recent jets/helicopters that are being produced.</p>
<p>The details and accessories are pretty cool: binoculars, map segment, helmet/goggles and shoulder tassles for the mini with his lil hooky hand!&nbsp;&nbsp;Four guns&nbsp;- 2 on the upper wing and one flanking each side of the pilot) to deter (and probablly instigate) any attack&nbsp;while flames spark from the exhaust from the old radial engine.</p>
<p>This model is a sleek design which contrasts the clunky bi-plane that came with the Desert Expedition set.</p>
<p>This is one of the few I have never dismantled.&nbsp; The only thing Lego could have done to improve this set was to make the actual model fly - it's just that good.</p>
<p>This is normally where I'd state that if you were a fan of bi-planes, vintage vehicles or the adventure series you should pick this up, but instead I'm going to broaden it some more: If you like Legos (and puppies - which have nothing to do with this set, just enforcing my statement) grab this.&nbsp; Perfect single model simplicity!</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

"zipper","2012-02-25T13:11:04.173Z","What a great plane!","This is probably one of the coolest sub $10 sets ever made. You get a fun plane, lots of guns, and a cool minifig all for $6. If only they made sets like this still.&nbsp;As with most sets, there are a couple of things that could be better, but they really aren't worth mentioning. This set will give hours of playtime, and is a great addition to the Adventurers theme.",FALSE,5,4,4,5,5
"IndyLibrarian","2014-06-22T20:02:23.737Z","A great set, even by today's standards","<p>One of the last sets I acquired before my Dark Ages, and one of the first I rebuilt after returning to active collecting!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Four rifles, binoculars, a treasure map, old-fashioned wheels!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The Baron looks fantastic with his leather aviator cap and goggles, white epaulettes, monocle, and hook.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not a big fan of airplanes - LEGO or real life - but this set is an exception. It is one of only two planes I own! I love the aesthetics of the Adventure themes; they are fun to build, beautiful to look at. This set ranks right at the top.</p>
