"indykid","2020-07-17T03:44:17.057Z","Great value for some adorable dinos","<p>Just got this in the mail today--it was on backorder but as of this writing&nbsp;it&#39;s available at&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/dr-wu-s-lab-baby-dinosaurs-breakout-75939"">LEGO.com</a>. I&#39;ve been waiting for it to be available in the US. Triceratops was my favorite dinosaur growing up and as soon as I saw the baby triceratops figure I knew I needed this set. I was surprised to find that the baby ankylosaurus is somehow even cuter once I opened it!</p>

<p>Really quick build and nothing too difficult or particularly clever though the mechanical arm is surprisingly versatile despite its simple design. The triceratops pen monitor display is angled down to be easier for minifigs to look at per the instructions but it looks a little odd from that angle and can be easily adjusted.&nbsp;There&#39;s only 1 printed brick and that&#39;s the mosquito in amber and the rest are stickers (8 of them). Stickers vary in difficulty--if you have shaky hands like me they might come out a little crooked but the pieces&nbsp;they stick&nbsp;on are big enough for it to hardly be noticeable. The hardest one was probably the laptop since the sticker is so tiny. The whole sticker aspect made me somewhat grateful I mostly collect modular buildings series&nbsp;so I don&#39;t encounter too many stickers normally.&nbsp;The best&nbsp;parts of the build are the dino nest and mechanical arm for the eggs. The arm moves really smooth and works really well. It looks great alongside the nest. The other really enjoyable&nbsp;part is the freestanding table with the microscope and laptop that finishes out the instructions. Really simple construction but all the detailed tools on it are fun.</p>

<p>Not a ton of cons here; namely the mechanism for breaking the window of the playpen open is not really well hidden at all and the top of the main monitor with the island on the screen looks strange without a long tile or something across it but I think it might be holographic which would explain this choice. I would&#39;ve liked a tiny camera in the dino pen which would correspond to the monitor display of the baby triceratops inside.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigs are great. This is my second (and first with minifigs)&nbsp;Jurassic World/Jurassic Park set since the extremely limited <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Studios/subtheme-Jurassic-Park-III"">Jurassic Park III sets</a> from 2001 so I don&#39;t mind having an Owen Grady minifig. But if you&#39;ve been collecting the Jurassic World sets I know he does come with many of them so you&#39;d potentially be getting a duplicate. I like his dual head expressions and the green and silver detailing on his torso which I believe is new for this year. Dr. Henry Wu is a welcome minifig--from what I can tell he&#39;s not in a whole lot of sets despite being an important character in the movies--and his dual head expressions are both great. Like I said the ankylosaurus is beyond adorable and the triceratops is as well and even has the potential for minifigs to ride her, since there is a gap in her back that is filled with a 1x2 brick and plate.</p>

<p>The parts aren&#39;t anything too crazy but there&#39;s some good ones. The translucent blue elements are all neat especially the top of the nest incubator and the ones that comprise the drinking bowl in the dino pen. The laptop is pretty cool even if its screen is a sticker. The eggs are pretty realistically sized for the movie. I liked the green syringes as well and though I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more along with the tranq gun in other Jurassic World sets it was novel to me. The mosquito in amber is super cool though and one of my favorite parts of the set. As someone who&#39;s seen the original&nbsp;Jurassic Park more times than I can count I was very happy to see it included.</p>

<p>I just got the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/30382-1/Baby-Velociraptor-Playpen"">Baby Velociraptor Playpen</a>&nbsp;yesterday and both sets really compliment each other well, especially with the matching blue color scheme. Judging by how big this set is (and the rarity of the baby dinos) I&#39;d say it&#39;s a great deal for only $20. It&#39;s not a difficult build by any means so it&#39;s a great one for kids who will also love the cute baby dinosaurs and the playability action of the window breaking and mechanical arm. I recommend this to any Jurassic Park fan or dinosaur fan!</p>

"graymattr","2020-12-07T19:26:06.463Z","Baby Dinosaurs!","<p>This is a fun set that will appeal to kids to build and play.&nbsp; I think adults will be interested in the baby dinosaurs and the accessories.&nbsp; For fans of the Jurassic World theme, these baby dinosaurs are a must-have.&nbsp; The baby Triceratops lacks moving limbs but it has a slot to allow minifigures to ride the beast or fill the slot with a 1x2 brick and plate when not riding.&nbsp; It uses dual molding to combine different colored plastic to form an accurate depiction.&nbsp; The baby Ankylosaurus also uses dual molding to achieve a fantastic appearance.&nbsp; Both are really cute creatures for kids.</p>

<p>The set includes similar but slightly different versions of Owen Grady and Dr. Henry Wu.&nbsp; Both minifigures are pretty good representations of the on-screen characters.&nbsp; Nothing intricate, but you don&#39;t expect that in this line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are quite a few accessories in this set: my favorite are two white eggs.&nbsp; The egg element has been used in other sets and other lines but I appreciate getting more.&nbsp; They are particularly important in this set recreating the laboratory where the eggs are incubated and hatched.&nbsp; There is a nice play feature in this set where the incubator top can open and a robotic arm remove an egg.&nbsp; My next favorite accessory is a 1x1 transparent orange brick with a mosquito printed on it.&nbsp; The computer monitors and laptop are also really nice looking accessories that can be used in a number of ways in your own builds.&nbsp; Beware that they are all stickers which is less satisfying, but they look good anyway.&nbsp; There are also syringes, baby bottle, a dart gun, mug, sink, binoculars, and three leaf pieces.</p>

<p>I particularly like how Lego is using a modular approach to build portions of the Jurassic World island.&nbsp; This set can easily be combined with other Jurassic World sets to make larger play areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building experience of this set is rather quick and straightforward, which is why I only gave it 3 stars.&nbsp; That&#39;s not a knock on the set, it&#39;s just that you don&#39;t expect complicated or innovative methods to build the wall of a lab.&nbsp; Given the dinosaurs, minifigures accessories, and a good variety of parts, this set is a great value, particularly if you can get it on sale.&nbsp; (Notice I&#39;m writing during the Christmas holiday season!)&nbsp; The play features make it a great set for any kid who enjoys the films or animals.&nbsp; I completely recommend this set.</p>
