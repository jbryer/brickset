<p><strong>Overall rating: 4/5 -</strong> If you&#39;re looking at this set for a child, they&#39;ll love it. Really, the only reason this isn&#39;t 5 stars is the price (a tad high). There is great playability, the minifigs and dinos are awesome, and the build is very straightforward.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building experience: 5/5 -</strong> Is the build overly simplified? Sure, but for for it&#39;s intended market (4+), it&#39;s a very simple build and a child can put this together with no help from an adult. I believe there is one SNOT technique and that&#39;s adding a leaf to the&nbsp;&#39;tree&#39;.</p>

<p><strong>Parts: 5/5 -</strong> The raptor is the main prize here and let&#39;s be real, if your child wanted this set it&#39;s most likely because they saw the raptor and thought it looked cool. Both minifigs included are solid with great printing on their torsos. If your child watches the JW: Legend of Isla Nublar show, they&#39;ll recognize the characters as well. Lastly, you get a baby raptor, which is adorable.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: 5/5</strong> - Two vehicles, two minifigs, and two dinos - for a child there&#39;s a lot of playability here. Plenty of chase and rescue scenarios that could be played out. The raptor has studs on her back, which to me encourages&nbsp;some fun/imaginative creations. Don&#39;t like the plane? Then add wings to the back of the raptor and have her zoom around chasing Owen or Sinjin.</p>

<p><strong>Value for money: 3/5 -</strong> Personally, for what you get, I find the RRP to be high ($30 USD) - you&#39;re paying a premium for that raptor. With that being said, I&#39;ve seen this set on sale locally, so depending on your location, you might be able to pick this up at a discount.</p>

"SuperMoose","2021-01-13T21:26:11.03Z","Lego, what happened?","<p>I do not know why Lego makes these sets with suboptimal building choices so expensive! It&#39;s cute, and I can round the size (spread out, of course) to about $19.99, but <em>$29.99</em> is absurd! For starters, the raptor is terrible. The colors are in total&nbsp;&nbsp;discord with each other, not bearing any realistic qualities or intrigue. Why didn&#39;t they print the teeth white?! Why didn&#39;t they print the tail at all? The raptor is overall terrible. The plane makes no sense?! Why not use a helicopter? I haven&#39;t seen an operating biplane in years? The quad looks awful, having no headlights, and the treehouse-thingy is tiny. I returned this right after I got it, as I did not want to spend 30 bucks on this. I overall think this set is terrible by price standards and size standards. When is the last time you saw a four-year-old walking around with $30, because any sensible parent or grandparent would not buy this for any child. People work hard to earn that money, Lego, and they do not want to be disappointed by stupid budget cuts and poor materials! Thank you.</p>
