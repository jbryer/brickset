"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-23T04:23:24Z","The Car That Lego Forgot","I got this set the same time as the all terrain trapper. This set is good or bad depending on your age. Those that have been around for a bit might find this set isn't worth buying, being that it has another Johnny Thunder and Doctor Kilroy that look the same as the ones in Egypt and Amazon. But in my case this was a great set. I had only started to get into Lego at that time. This was the first Adventurers theme I was around for. So I got my first Johnny Thunder and Doctor Kilroy in this set. But aside from that this set is still brilliant. The car has TREADMILLS for wheels. This could make it all terrain if you’re not into physics like me. Also you have a two seat driving compartment (I LOVE IT). This would get a ten for me; bbbuuutttt there is the matter of the camp spot. It's pointless, sure you get a flame, a sauce pan, a 2x2 round plate and a big leaf but that’s it (well the big green plate comes in useful every now and then). So in summary, a very cool yet slightly pointless set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-18T03:00:38Z","Cool","This was my first adventure set in the Dino Island theme. When I was younger I liked dinosaurs alot and played with this set heaps. I like the little camp and the Treadmill wheels are just wild. They are so cool. The Johnny Thunder was my 3rd in total but it got me my first Kilroy.
The steering and controls are alright and the little box with all the tools isn't to bad either.
Pros:
* Treadmill tires
* Kilroy and Thunder
* Little camp
Cons:
* Just a bit boring if you are not intertested in dinosaur lego (unless you want the tires)

Overall this set is cool and the set is overall a great set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-05-07T11:45:22.297Z","Dino Tracks","This is another set with the obligatory box of tools and a dinosaur, this time a red flying one in this set.  Like the glider, there's also a weird stone/rock/greenery piece which seems rather pointless especially so now that they've added a flame and a pot to this set's &quot;scenery&quot;.  What is nice about this set ist the design of the actual vehicle itself, which is its saving grace.  The bonnet of the vehicle with treads - is it a tank or some sort of hybrid vehicle - comes complete with quite a bit of details, the vehicle sits 2 and there's space for the box of tools at the back, the hallmarks of what made the Adventurer sets great.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-11T01:59:10.873Z","Tank type tracks to plow threw rough terrain","Most appealing thin to this set it the tracks. You do get Dr Kilroy with this set and of coure Johnny. Fair amount of extra pieces. It is alot of fun to build and is not like many LEGO has produced to my knowledge. A must for the Adventure fans.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sethlee","2007-11-24T00:38:19.09Z","future car","this set is good beacomes with 2 characters and lots of items the car is like the future old fashion car exept more high tech even it has a own camping set but it needs more characters 2 or 3 more so the set is complete.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-30T18:20:52.45Z","awsome tank","the tank is why i bought it, the teradacdle and camp are cool too but i would pay full price for just the tank. it has a masive motor and wicked tracks, legos never made anything like it. they need to though. i dont have the camp together so i cant talk about it, but they teradactle is cool butit needs to be a bit bigger. i love this set i shoulda bought more",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Pepper","2008-05-03T21:36:33.297Z","Great set","I got this set a few years ago. Strangely this is my only Johnny Thunder minifig.

I reccomend it.",TRUE,4,5,5,4,3
"asianlego","2008-09-13T13:32:15.327Z","Just Like Indy Jones","Back then there were no Indiana Jones Lego, so fans of Indy could only go as far as buying Adventurers sets. Johnny Thunder as Indy, Dr. Kipling as Henry Jones Sr, but I don't remember any Marion Ravenwood impersonators in the Adventurers series. In this set, the cat-track vehicle has a solid design and combines the looks of a 1920's luxury towncar and an earth mover. This is a very good buy indeed, this was during the times that you could get a really good pack for $20.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"spyder38","2008-08-16T17:11:43.687Z","awesome!","this was one of my first lego sets and i loved it! it came with alot of gear and 2 minifigs: johnny thunder and the professor man. i liked that it came with other options to build like a boat, which i did. lego kinnd threw in the camp at the last second, but i still love it.

"Yoda____","2008-10-29T14:58:57.483Z","dino's rock","This set has everything a set this price should have it has cool accesories a great model, cool minifigures and a little something extra. This set ticks all the boxes. The dinosaur in it looks good and the treadmills on the car are awesome the scenery looks nice and this subtheme is pure genius.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Batmaniam","2009-03-23T12:04:26.607Z","Wow","I love this set. It is awesome. At the time I thought that this was the closest I was ever going to get to Indy sets, but I was wrong. This set has a great car/tank, with treads. Two very nice minifigs, and tonnes of accesories. It has a rare....I forget what it is called, the dino with wings. Also it includes instuctions (or just a pic) for how to build this into a boat. Nice peices. And overall nice little set. Extremely hard to find now a days.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-29T10:09:49.603Z","LEGO Adventurers (Dino Island) - Dino Explorer Review","This is one of my favourite LEGO Adventurers (Dino Island) set from the smaller sets of that theme. It's a very sturdy set, very easy to build and lot's of fun! This set also doesn't have any stickers. The atv looks very neat and the treads move very nice. It has a trunk on the back where you can store a box with some cool accessories and the cockpit is so big that you can put in two minifigs. We also get some rocks and a campfire with this model. This set also includes another Johnny Thunder and another Dr. Kilroy minifig and you also get a red dinosaur in this set. I think this set has some great value for little money.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
