"1947andallthat","2020-12-23T23:45:49.65Z","A crucial addition to Hogwarts","<p>Not a great deal of representation has been given over the 19-year history of the Harry Potter theme to the Room of Requirement, especially given its instrumental role in the plots of all the last three instalments of the series. There&#39;s a case for this being understandable; after all, the Room of Requirement&#39;s two featured forms (the Room of Hidden Things and the headquarters of Dumbledore&#39;s Army) are both very large spaces, the former full of far too much... stuff, the latter very sparse on stuff.</p>

<p>However, we at last have a full set dedicated to this vital part of Hogwarts. But will this rendition successfully fulfil our requirements as Lego fans? (That is, is it good?)</p>

<p><strong>Box &amp; Instructions</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a no-nonsense thumb tab box, surprisingly deep, containing&nbsp;two numbered bags, a modest instruction booklet, and a disproportionately large sticker sheet with 8 of the little blighters on it (although they are all&nbsp;reasonably easy to apply).</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>Nothing to see here, really. A couple of steps - lining up the sliding wall and the mechanism inside the fireplace - are slightly fiddly, but nothing that a builder with a little bit of experience can&#39;t handle with ease.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Of course, the big stir about this set has been the inclusion of Hermione and Luna&#39;s Patronuses, an otter and a hare respectively, just as we see in the Order of the Phoenix film. These pieces are absolutely perfect representations, and they&#39;d be perfect moulds on which to base more corporeal versions of these two animals. The only other thing I picked up on during the build was the presence of two 2x2 bright bluish green&nbsp;plates hidden in the build, new for 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Four exclusive minifigures is certainly a rare blessing for a set of this size, including an exclusive variant of&nbsp;<strong>Harry Potter</strong>. This version shows Harry as he is most often seen while teaching the D.A., with an open cardigan revealing his unkempt Gryffindor tie, and with full height legs to represent Harry being in his later school years by now. Other than the slightly different version with a full jumper found in #40419, this is the only minifigure of Harry from after Philosopher&#39;s/Sorcerer&#39;s Stone to come in school uniform. He comes with his ever present dark brown wand, and can be equipped with blue Power Blasts, seemingly meant to represent Patronus &#39;energy&#39;. The presence of an actual Patronus for Harry would have been marvellous, but given the price point and the ready availability of #75945, that would definitely have been unlikely.</p>

<p>Similarly to Harry, this is the only place in the rebooted theme where you can find a version of&nbsp;<strong>Hermione Granger</strong>&nbsp;in school uniform from after Chamber of Secrets. Like Harry, she comes here with full height legs, but unlike Harry, her uniform is neat and fully buttoned (as to be expected from her, I suppose). She is completed by a fairly common but ideally suited hairpiece and a dark tan wand alongside her otter Patronus.</p>

<p><strong>Luna Lovegood</strong>&nbsp;has never appeared before in her school uniform, and this minifigure is perfect for the job. This is the first minifigure to show a Hogwarts uniform featuring a waistcoat, which looks nice, especially given the Butterbeer cork necklace which has been accurately printed across Luna&#39;s torso. An appropriate long blond hairpiece and a medium brown wand also come with this minifigure. Given that Luna is only a fourth year at this point and all other fourth years have been represented with medium height legs, it seems odd that this figure has full height legs, but it does look nice to have consistency across these three students.</p>

<p>Finally, the&nbsp;<strong>Mechanical Death Eater</strong>&nbsp;which the D.A. practice their spells on completes the array of characters. A nicely printed torso and headpiece are used here, but the &#39;legs&#39; of the figure remain plain, disappointingly. Its hood might also have been better represented by the newer hood element rather than the older, but it still looks perfectly serviceable. A small pair of wheels, accurate to the film, and a small stand allow the dummy to stand independently, whilst it wields a dark brown wand.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>The finished wall of the Room of Requirement is quite substantial, 18 centimetres wide. The large trans-blue panels in the walls provide a reasonably effective impression of the mirrored walls which surround the D.A. headquarters as seen in the fifth film. Genuine mirrored pieces would have been very welcome, but they would presumably have been prohibitively expensive to manufacture. The elaborate structures hanging over each panel look impressive and also give a decent impression of the unsupported vaulting which fills the Room.</p>

<p>However, I am especially impressed by the fireplace on the right, which has a fantastic looking mantelpiece and chimney breast. The flames inside the fireplace also look attractive, especially because of a very effective sticker behind them which increases the apparent size of the flames. The only other furnishing in the chamber, and the only one featured prominently in the film, is the freestanding noticeboard, with a couple of articles from the Daily Prophet pinned to it alongside an inspirational photo of Cedric Diggory. Above all, I am pleased by the presence of a photograph of the original assembled Order of the Phoenix, clearly featuring the silhouettes of some notable witches and wizards from the First Wizarding War.</p>

<p>In an impressive use of space, the reverse side of this model also features some details from the corridors of Hogwarts. Unfortunately, this side remains dominated by the trans-blue panelling, which looks disappointingly disconcerting and is in my mind the only serious&nbsp;flaw with this model. In between them, a sliding panel of wall can be used to disguise the doorway into the room, a simple yet pleasing mechanism which works perfectly. On the wall behind the fireplace, Professor Umbridge has hung four of her educational decrees; although they are not quite the shape or format of the decrees seen in the film, they are still a very welcome inclusion, and their numbers,&nbsp;abridged contents &amp; distinctive typefaces&nbsp;are also taken directly from the film (namely Educational Decrees 23, 30, 68 &amp; 82). These decrees also conceal an additional feature &mdash; if the 2x3 panel in the chimney breast is pressed, three of the decrees will burst from the wall behind it, as if Fred &amp; George themselves had attacked them.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>If you ask me, this was a very welcome addition to the Harry Potter range. This set of minifigures - and especially their Patronuses - are certainly interesting, and although the model backing them is flawed in some regards, multiple fun details and features remain. Above all, I believe that, given how hard adapting this colossal and unusual room to Lego form was always going to be, this is an admirable rendition of a location otherwise almost absent from the theme. Ultimately, though, this is definitely one of the weakest sets of the rebooted theme &mdash; although a casual fan of Harry Potter will definitely be pleased by the new features offered in this set, I would only recommend that a devoted fan of the franchise like myself should go out of their way to buy it.</p>

"graymattr","2021-03-24T17:00:32.98Z","Hogwarts' hidey-hole","<p>This is another great Harry Potter set in the ~$20 range.&nbsp; You get a nice little playset with some fun features, four really nice minifigures and two fantastic beasts.&nbsp; (See what I did there?)</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>At this point, all four of the minifigures are unique to this set and that may be enough for the dedicated HP fans but these figs are really good standard representations of Harry, Hermione and Luna.&nbsp; The printing on each torso makes it clear who is who and is right out of the movie.&nbsp; Getting the mechanical Death Eater is a useful antagonist for the students to encounter while playing.</p>

<p><strong>Patronus&#39;</strong></p>

<p>Brand new animal pieces have been introduced in this set for the rabbit and otter patronus charms of Hermione and Luna respectively.&nbsp; The transparent light blue color with glitter mixed in looks good to approximate the animals shown in the movie.&nbsp; These are wonderful pieces and we&#39;ll obvisouly get them molded in more natural colors in future sets.</p>

<p><strong>Playset</strong></p>

<p>The Room of Requirement build is decent given the small size of the set.&nbsp; There are nice features such as the hidden door that slides to reveal the door to the room and the falling proclamation plaques with Umbridge&#39;s fascist rules provided on stickers.&nbsp; There is also a bulletin board that can be moved around (again, it uses a sticker.)&nbsp; I thought building the columns above the windows is a nice ornamental result to give the set more of a Hogwart&#39;s feel.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Finite Incantatem</strong></p>

<p>I easily recommend this set to anyone that is a Harry Potter fan.&nbsp; It&#39;s a lot of fun for a fair and reasonable price.</p>

"VictorJiangKiangLiangMiang","2021-10-10T02:48:45.69Z","Room of Requirement Review- One of the worst Harry Potter sets ever","<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>

<p>Harry Potter has been one of the most consistent themes, providing sections of Hogwarts and iconic locations. This time, the spectacular Room of Requirement, one of the most iconic and eminently mystifying locations of Hogwarts, has been turned into a small lego set. And how is it? My answer- a dejecting disappointment.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The build mainly focuses on constructing the so-called Room of Requirement. And it is one&hellip; if you are optimistic. Essentially a slab of a wall with some ornamental decorations, this is perhaps the most disappointing Hogwarts renderings from Lego, and appear to resemble the entrance to the room than anything. The set also comes from some patronuses, suggesting that the purpose for the Room of Requirement in this case is to practice Defence against the Dark Arts spells from the Dumbledore&#39;s&nbsp;Army as observed in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. But where to place these patronuses remain especially underwhelming. Placing them at the door-like slab of the wall (or an entrance)? This makes absolutely no thematic sense at all.</p>

<p>Worse still is attempting to configure this set in the Hogwarts castles. Perhaps the most fitting one is by the side at the Astronomy Tower, which seems reasonable, but numerous issues are quickly unravelled,&nbsp;the main one being scale. The Room of the Requirement, with its glorified entrance, is not on the same scale with the rest, which&nbsp;is absolutely deplorable! For instance, its length is around that of the Astronomy Tower, but, in reality, it is within the Hogwarts Castle in one floor. Once again, this is extraordinarily perplexing, and the design does not vindicate how this make sense.</p>

<p>So, with this set scanty by its own and incongruous when displayed together, what is its ultimate saving grace? As a parts pack.</p>

<p><strong>Parts and Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Despite the three nice Minifigures- Harry, Hermione and Luna- appearing in standard uniforms, the Death Eater Mummy and patronuses are the main&nbsp;highlights for collectors, and that might partially vindicate buying those set- just for those excellent parts. However, from my perspective you must be an avid Harry Potter fan to do that and already have tons of those sets in your city- and that is irrefutably a small percentage of collectors.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Inherently, this set does not have a wide range of play features to attract KFOLs, mostly being a stab of a wall, but there is one clever one comprising Technic pieces for the educational decrees. This is a quirky&nbsp;feature, but provide limited play value, and this set by itself does not offer too much playability unless you have a roaming imagination.</p>

<p><strong>Value for Money</strong></p>

<p>Now we reach the most crucial juncture in reviews- is this set good value for money? Licensed sets tend to be expensive, but&nbsp;Harry Potter sets frequently offer reasonable value for money contrasting to other ones. However, in my opinion this set, despite having reasonable price to part ratios (at $19.99 USA dollars and $29.99 Australian dollars), is of poor value for most AFOLs and KFOLs.</p>

<p>Firstly, AFOLs would likely&nbsp;find this set lacking in displayability by itself, and, upon connecting to their existing Hogwarts sets, miscellaneous styles and scales are induced. This set could potentially have MOC potentials, but it would require extensive modification- since it is merely a slab of a wall. As a result, the set does feel overpriced due to wasted potential. The mere reasons to acquire this set are the following: if you are a Harry Potter fan and want to purchase every set, or if you seek the parts offered in this set. For those collectors, this set might be of a tolerable value, although I can not say that a set&rsquo;s value is satisfactory merely for collecting purposes. As a result, for most AFOLs this set would be of poor value.</p>

<p>KFOLs would likely appreciate this set more and forgive the flaws, but the limited playability would be an issue. For younger audiences, sets from other themes would have ore playability at the same price and offering greater appeal. In contrast, older KFOLs and Harry Potter fans might view the set as decent but flawed. Hence, this set is likely of mediocre value to KFOLs, and might satisfy Harry Potter fans, but there are far more complete and cohesive sets at this price.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The Room of Requirement is a prominent feature in Hogwarts and Lego releasing a separate set is deserved. Despite an excellent idea, the execution is unfortunately atrocious. The build is essentially a slab of a wall that does not even live up to its name, displaying it next to other Hogwarts sets would be extremely flawed! Therefore, the value to most collectors is poor. Further, KFOLs might see value to this, but the playability is inferior&nbsp;compared to other sets. Exclusive Harry Potter fans who wish to acquire this for MOC purposes or the pieces might find this set to a satisfactory value, especially during a sale, but I would not recommend this set.</p>

<p>Score: 30/100</p>

<p>Sidenote: This set is rated 3.8/5 on Brickset, which is decent but lower than many other Harry Potter sets, and I can definitely see why.</p>
