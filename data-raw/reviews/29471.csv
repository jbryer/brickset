When one thinks of iconic Harry Potter moments, I&#39;m sure &quot;the scene where Umbridge gets picked up by a giant and dragged away by centaurs&quot; isn&#39;t at the top of the list.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, that makes this set all the more eye-catching, and who wouldn&#39;t want to be able to recreate the scene where Professor Umbridge finally gets her comeuppance?&nbsp;</p>

<p>With that out of the way, let&#39;s dive in to the review.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>I must say that getting five figures, four of which are exclusive, in one $30 set is extremely pleasing. The inclusion of Dolores Umbridge in something other than the exclusive Bricktober pack is nice, and her outfit is perfectly, sickeningly pink. The only thing I would change about her is possibly giving her an angry face to complement the fearful one instead of a smile, an inclusion that I believe would fit the scene in question better.</p>

<p>Harry and Hermione are nice inclusions. I love Hermione&#39;s bushy hairpiece and exclusive torso, and while this Harry figure also appears in the Attack on the Burrow set, he&#39;s about as accurate as you could ask for.</p>

<p>The star of the show for many is the two centaurs. They feature a new horse-leg piece and double-sided faces to give them some variety. I don&#39;t understand why the color of their tails is different from their hair color, but this is a minor complaint in an otherwise stunning lineup of figures.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Even when excluding minifigure parts, there are still quite a few nice pieces in this small set. The lantern and chicken leg pieces are always pleasing inclusions, the new hollow tree trunk part is a delight, and the sand-green sausages used for the mushroom stems might be one of my favorite recolors ever (moldy hot dogs, anyone?). The spiky black pieces used for Grawp&#39;s hair are nice too.</p>

<p><strong>The Builds</strong></p>

<p>We get two main structures in this set: a tree and Grawp the giant. There have been three different sets based on the Forbidden Forest in the past three years, each with their won unique tree designs. This one is no exception.</p>

<p>Details include a spider hanging down from a tree branch and the delightful mushrooms mentioned above. The trunk is rather cylindrical and isn&#39;t very detailed on three of four sides, but that is necessary because without the large, hollow trunk pieces, it couldn&#39;t open up to store accessories inside! I love it when sets have secret storage compartments and moving parts, and this set includes a lantern, a chicken leg, a bone, and a set of bicycle handlebars to store within the tree when one isn&#39;t using them for play or display.</p>

<p>But the real star of the show here is undoubtedly Grawp the giant. He towers over everything else, even the tree, and I love how they designed him to look like a giant minifigure. He has all the articulation of a minifigure and then some, including moving legs, arms, hands, and head. He can hold a minifigure by the legs in either hand, which is useful to recreate the scene with Umbridge or even the earlier one with Hermione. I love the variety of pieces used to represent his messy hair, a detail that continues around the back of his head.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the same can&#39;t be said for the rest of the brick-built figure, for the remainder of his rear side is mostly exposed tile backs. While I understand why this might annoy some people, I personally don&#39;t mind it. Some of it is necessary to provide full articulation to keep the piece count (and, thus, the price) down, and besides, why would anyone want to display Grawp from the back in the first place?</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Forbidden Forest: Umbridge&#39;s Encounter is a great set. Sure, one tree isn&#39;t much of a forest, and Grawp doesn&#39;t look the greatest from the rear, but the pros definitely outweigh the cons with this one. I would absolutely recommend&nbsp;this set to anyone looking for a rewarding build and an eye-catching display piece.</p>
