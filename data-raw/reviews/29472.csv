<p>Although I didn&#39;t purchase it for playability I personally don&#39;t like the feature to pull out the window. It&#39;s a bit niche for me.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Another reuse of those&nbsp;Ron and Harry figures is just boring. I like the inclusion of Dobby but makes me feel the other variant in the collectable minifigures series a waste of space.</p>

<p>I would&#39;ve preferred Fred and George rather than Ron and Dobby (although they may show up in a rumoured Diagon Alley).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The inclusion of the Dursley&#39;s is also a very welcome one, they are a highlight of the set.</p>

<p>The interior of the Dursley house is 10/10. With some unique building techniques and some brilliant colours.It is overall the best part of the set.</p>

<p>Overall, a great improvement over the previous version and a welcome inclusion to this year&#39;s wave. I have my personal problems with the set but it&#39;s overall a great model with something there for children and adults alike!</p>

<div style=""width:6.5868in"">
<div style=""width:6.5868in"">
<h3><span style=""font-weight:bold"">Box/Instructions</span></h3>

<p>The set comes in a standard box for nearly 800 pieces, with the parts separated into 5 bags. One olive green 8x16 plate comes lose in the box. There is also a perfectly bound, 182 page, instruction book and a sticker sheet. Luckily for me my sticker sheet wasn&#39;t bent as it was between the loose plate and the box but I imagine that could happen to some people.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight:bold"">Price</span></h3>

<p>This set retails for $99.99 AUD / $69.99 USD giving it a ppp of 8.8c. I was able to purchase this set for 20% plus I had a few giftcards so I ended up only paying $20 of my own money. I do feel like the set is slightly overpriced for what you get but being licenced and including two exclusive minifigures does make the price understandable.</p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight:bold"">Parts</span></h3>

<p>This set is full of tan and dark tan bricks for the exterior and there&#39;s a total of 67 3x1 Rooftiles in black for the roof. There are no new parts but five recolours: Mini Wig No. 39 in Dark Brown, Frame 1x4x6 in Dark Brown, Mini Wig. No. 22 in Light Bluish Grey, Plate w/ bow 1x2x2/3 in Medium Blue and Plate w/ bow 3x4x2/3 W. knobs in Medium Blue. There are some other parts that have been recently recoloured/rare particularly Dark Brown pieces.</p>

<p>There are 4 printed pieces (other than minifigures) are Flat Tile 2x2, No. 376 in Tan (Daily Prophet Newspaper), Flat Tile 1x2, No. 287 (Letter and the set comes with 3) and the two owls: Owl &quot;No. 1&quot; in Reddish Brown and Owl, No. 10 in white.</p>

<p>This set has quite a few stickers, mainly for the house. Stickers include two photos, a 2x2 of Harry&#39;s parents and a 2x3 of the Dursleys. There&#39;s also three stickers for door decoration, one for each side of the front door and one for the vent into the cupboard under the stairs. A small sticker of Hogwarts merch is on a 1x2x2 brick in Harry&#39;s new room and a sticker is placed on the inside of a 1x2x4 panel to represent the &quot;toys&quot; in the cupboard under the stairs. There are also a few stickers on the car, two for the number plates (matching the ones in the film) and two on the widows to create a triangular back window.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight:bold"">Minifigures</span></h3>

<p>This set comes with six minifigures, two of whom have never appeared in a Lego set before. The Harry and Ron that comes with this set are almost identical to the pair in 75953: Hogwarts Whomping Willow, however here Harry has Black short legs. The Dobby figure is very similar to the collectable minifigure series from 2018 but the head (a soft rubber) has different mouth printing, featuring teeth.</p>

<p>Vernon Dursley has had a significant upgrade since his first, and only, appearance in 2002&#39;s 4728: Escape from Privet Drive. He has a Medium Nougat jumper, Tan pants, Light Bluish Grey hair and a double-sided face (strained happy and angry). His outfit doesn&#39;t explicitly match any from the films but suits the character well.</p>

<p>Appearing for the first time are Vernon&#39;s Wife and Son, Petunia and Dudley. Petunia has a White blouse with dark red and orange leaves on it, New Dark Red legs, Dark Brown hair and a double-sided face (pursed lips and yelling). Her outfit is recognisable from the films and transferred really well into Lego. Dudley has a Red jumper, Dark Tan short legs and Reddish Brown hair, like his parents he also has a double-sided face (smirking and scared).</p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight:bold"">The Build</span></h3>

<p>The bulk of the set is in the house but there are also three side builds, ranging in size. There&#39;s the pudding that Aunt Petunia made for the Masons, represented with layers of White, Medium Lavender and Spring Yellowish Green. Cleverly the designers used a clear dish and antenna to make it look like Dobby is levitating the dessert, this build looks great and actuate to the film, especially for only 14 pieces. Another small side build is the Privet Drive sign (decorated with a sticker) which features an owl and is also very actuate to the film.</p>

<p>Next build (actually built last) is the Flying Ford Anglia, Lego&#39;s forth iteration of this vehicle and the second since the theme&#39;s revival in 2018. The car is very similar to the design found in 75953: Hogwarts Whomping Willow, however there has been some slight alterations to the hood and back windows as well as the addition of an opening boot. The car can fit both boys in it but not next to each other which is a bit disappointing. Note the car can&#39;t fit two adults in, only an adult and a child or two children.</p>

<p>On to the house, bag 1 and 2 construct the first floor of the house, bag 3 is the second floor and bag 4 is the roof. The first floor consists of the living room, staircase and cupboard under the stairs as well as some foliage in the front. The couches in the living room stand out against the Tan as they are mostly made of Medium Lavender there is also a plant on a small table and a floor lamp in the corner. The living room is home to one of the main play features of the set, the letters coming out of the fireplace. A small mechanism is made which, when the gear is turned, releases letters that fly across the carpet. There is a small slot in the exterior wall behind the fireplace to replace and letters. The staircase build is simple, employing a few Blue 2x4 which harkens back to old school Lego. Under the stairs of course is Harry&#39;s original bedroom, accessible by a small door in the house or by removing a section of the exterior wall. Inside is a small bed on the floor, some tools and the sticker representing old toys.</p>

<p>The second level is only 5 studs deep and simply consists of a desk and a bed for Harry. There is a small section of wall behind the bed that is easily removable and features bars, the chain from the car can easily pull it out. The bed is a nice build, with a checked bed spread and white pillow but that&#39;s about the extent of the upper floor. Outside features a sloping black roof made of alternating heights of 3x1 Rooftiles and a few chimney/antenna decorations. There is also the suggestion of drainage pipes and a neatly maintained garden in the front.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span style=""font-weight:bold"">Overall Opinion</span></h3>

<p>Overall I enjoyed most aspects of the set, I think the design of the house is highly accurate to the films and aesthetically pleasing. However, I think the inclusion of the flying car is almost unnecessary as it drives up the price and is already included in a set that is (as of now) still on sale. This set is not only appealing to Harry Potter fans but also to fans of Lego houses as it provides a great base and a somewhat unique design (to Lego at least). The play features of the set work well and don&#39;t detract from the look of the set. This is a great set for a Harry Potter fan, especially considering many weren&#39;t even born when the original version came out.</p>

Great added playability features such as posting the letters through the fireplace and pulling the bars from harry&#39;s window! You end up with a beautiful piece to display and it&#39;s good value for money, especially with the minifigs.&nbsp;</p>

"pandidora","2021-04-16T13:38:08.16Z","My favourite 2020 HP set","<p>Bought this&nbsp;set as a 32-year-old adult during March 2021 to ease my quarantine blues and boredom. I haven&#39;t had a lego in my hands in the last 20 years. Since that I&#39;m hooked on the Lego Harry Potter sets!</p>

<p>I had so much fun building this and discover the awesome details I can&#39;t explain it! It brings a smile to my face every time I look at this Lego. It&#39;s not just a fun toy but an accurate memorabilia.</p>

<p>The exterior looks exactly like in the movies. I love displaying this piece on my cupboard. The house has a cosy, homey and warm atmosphere on the inside and outside as well. I especially love the roof, the eaves and the flowers. The interior seems very well-designed: here my favourite parts are the standing lamp and the couch/arm chair. The cupboard under the stairs is a welcome inclusion. If they had left it out I would miss it.</p>

<p>All six of the minifigures are on-point and essential for the set. All of them looks perfect, I couldn&#39;t image anything better! I love Dobby and I&#39;m very happy to own him!</p>

<p>I think this set has a great playability. My favourite feature is the letters falling from the chimney! Also the cupboard under the stairs offers some playtime. But my other favourite part of the set is the Ford Anglia and the feature to remove the window and free Harry! The car is very intriguing, it&#39;s one of the reasons I choose this set above anything else. Even in my childhood I was interested in my brother&#39;s Lego cars.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t recommend this set enough! I think it&#39;s accurate, offers hours of entertainment even for kids and has a great price/value ratio. It&#39;s not overly big, so it doesn&#39;t take up too much space like the bigger sets, so anyone can comfortably display this piece. Since then I bought some bigger Harry Potter sets and none of them reached the same level of fun and excitement (though the Burrow is close enough).</p>

<p>This just stole my heart forever, it has everything a Potterhead needs! Even though I wasn&#39;t a Lego-fan before buying this I became one after finishing it. I just bought it for fun and curiosity and I got so much more than I expected!</p>
