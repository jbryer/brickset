"Thanosvbest","2020-07-25T10:22:25.047Z","The best Hogwarts set ","<p>The lego Hogwarts astronomy tower is definitely the best lego Hogwarts expansion and here is why.</p>

<p>To start of with the figures including an exclusive Horace slughorn,&nbsp; exclusive luna&nbsp;lovegood, exclusive Hermione granger, exclusive Ronald Weasley ,&nbsp; exclusive lavender brown, exclusive Harry Potter and a draco Malfoy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first build of the set is a greenhouse witch has 4 mandrakes despite not being as good as the previous one they are not too bad. The roof is movable to allow more play.</p>

<p>Then there are another potions room. I think that it should have been a different room because we have one in the whomping willow, it should have been a libary.</p>

<p>Finally, the actual tower has 5 floors first has a broom and an entrance. The second has Horace Slughorn&nbsp; office with a lantern and letter the third floor has the Ravenclaw&nbsp;dormitories the fourth floor has the astronomy section and the last flaw has the telescope. One problem with the tower is the white frames.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is also a small table with 3 of the uncommon waffle piece. It also includes the new Hedwig.</p>

<p>Over all this set is great and I would recommend it to you especially if you have any other attachments.&nbsp;</p>

"Lego_Photos_X","2022-09-17T17:35:34.593Z","Nice Hogwarts expansion","<p>When i first time saw it I had to buy it. I&#39;m not a big fan of Harry Potter, but I still like the build. Also, I just LOVE Lego Castle, so the build is really nice.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong>You get total 8 minifigures. First of all you have Harry Potter. It&#39;s kinda great looking one, with just one of those classic dark brown hairs. I would say, that the outfit could be better. Then you got Hermione, Ron, Neville, Luna, Lavender, Draco and Gran. I really like some of the designs, but I am not the best one to say, because... I don&#39;t really collect Harry Potter too much.</p>

<p><b>Astronomy Tower:&nbsp;</b>Now to the building itself. I like it a lot, and it&#39;s probably the best lego Harry Potter building ever. I have some other Harry Potter sets, but this is the biggest one. Maybe one of the biggest reasons why I bought this set is that it comes out with 2 books which is just really cool. Also, there are some plants in it. + I really love the design of Herbology class, or whatever it is. There are 4 different floors in it. One is the bedroom for ravenclaws, one is for spells (entrance hall/room), one is for the &quot;teacher&quot;. The last one is for the actual astronomy. It does have things like telescope. You can also combine this build to other hogwarts sets.</p>

<p><strong>Good Things:</strong></p>

<p>- Nicely detailed astronomy tower with three sections.</p>

<p>- 2 Books. One brown and one green.</p>

<p>- 8 Harry Potter themed minifigures.</p>

<p>- Can combined with other Hogwarts sets.</p>

<p>- Many rooms to put minifigures in them.</p>

<p><b>Bad things:</b></p>

<p>- There is nothing really bad about this set. I think it should be more complete from the left side, but that&#39;s just alright.</p>

<p><strong>Is it worth it?/My personal opinion</strong></p>

<p>When it comes to question &quot;is it worth it?&quot; i would say it is worth it if you are a Harry Potter fan, but if you buy this set for pieces, minifigures... or anything else, I would say it&#39;s not worth the price. I have never regretted buying a Lego set, but this one... Man, I could&#39;ve just pass it. I really tho like the build &amp; Kinda have learned to like it. Nice shelf piece! (some people might put&nbsp;dislike to this review, &quot;because I don&#39;t like HP too much&quot;, but I want to say that I still like this particular set much).</p>
