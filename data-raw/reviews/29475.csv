It represented a moment from the end of the first &lsquo;season&rsquo;, now we get to see the new parts in all their glory as Jack and Parker get an upgrade. This small set is very impressive and definitely worth picking up for fans of this Theme.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;m going to enjoy putting all of these packages together on a shelf after I buy the rest of the Theme. I&rsquo;ve been keeping these boxes because I like the stylised art design, despite what some think, the boxes are very creative and a fairly impressive choice to highlight the sets more on the &lsquo;backs&rsquo; of the boxes with physical images and animated versions on the front. It reminds me more of other &lsquo;old school&rsquo; style toy&nbsp;lines where the toys were shown in fanciful situations to inspire the imagination and play styles of the kids who wanted to buy them. It&rsquo;s a huge departure from typical LEGO box designs and a gamble that, unfortunately, doesn&rsquo;t seem to have paid off.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual design is the same as last year&rsquo;s sets and shows the build steps and all of the app and wave cross promotions. Standard manual design which works well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Fairly decent selection of parts here, including some very nice suspension elements for the tires. Sometimes I wonder why I keep trying to discuss this section, might cut it out for reviews I type in 2021, as I clearly don&rsquo;t think my discussion of the elements is considered very helpful in my discussions.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Jack: The main heroes have had an upgrade for Year Two of Hidden Side. The torso and legs are, I believe, using the same prints as year one, but now Jack gets to wear a backwards style cap complete with unique hair design sticking out from underneath the cap. No longer with his hood up, Jack gets to show off his stylish new do and design. He includes terrified and joyful expressions and his phone tile is, as always, included with the set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Parker: Her outfit in this set seems to be similar to others where she&rsquo;s removed part of her outer jacket, you still see the black top with the light bluish arms, her pants are the same as we&rsquo;ve seen in other sets with all the added detailing in the print, and her head and phone tile are pretty similar if not the same as past Hidden Side sets. The biggest addition is the brand new hair sculpt, complete with built-in headphones, this curly light purple hair element is a brilliant new piece and a great personality enhancing look for the character.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Scott Francis: This resident of Newbury runs a local branch of Octan Gas, judging by the pump build included with this set. (A full Gas Station may have been nicer, especially if it included some transformation aspect.) He includes a unique new torso print with an Octan gas uniform vibe, the logo on the back has a mascot with two crossed wrenches on it. Pretty clever. He comes with a printed welders helmet to protect him when repairing the buggy.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Extra head elements are included to show Scott has been possessed, by two specters it seems. He has a unique ghoulish neck attachment that can accommodate two ghost heads, one with bushy eyebrows that can wear the welders helmet and the other with less defined eyebrows and some slimy green hair. Must be brothers.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Scott&rsquo;s regular head features stubble and two separate expressions, happy and what may be slightly nervous/scared.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Trucker Dale: The ghost character seen on the app is highly horrifying, with a massive bulky form with truck parts integrated into him. His death must have been truly horrific. That being said, as with most ghosts from this Theme he only exists in the app, and you will be battling him when you access the set in the app.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 1: Scott starts building the chassis of the buggy with this bag. It&rsquo;s a pretty quick build, a few sticker placements are in this build, but nothing much aside from that which may prove troubling. It&rsquo;s quick and easy because it&rsquo;s a simple bit of brick and plate attaching with a few slopes and tiles tossed in for good measure.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 2: Parker and Jack hop out to help and they don&rsquo;t have much to do, the suspension and tires, the app rainbow wheel and the ghost catching canon and all the necessary attachment points for the top of the buggy are built here. Very quick and easy to do without any tricky moments. You also build the side model gas pump.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Beach Buggy: This thing is glorious. I love the look of it and the real-working suspension is a huge seller. The tires bob and weave while you roll it along to chase down the ghosts, there are no real play features, the ghost catching cannon on top does not launch studs, the rainbow colour wheel spins of course for scan function with the app, but as a play set item there isn&rsquo;t a whole lot here. Kids might enjoy racing around and pretending to hunt ghosts on the beach, or on the way to the beach, but ultimately if you aren&rsquo;t using this to interact with the App there isn&rsquo;t much to the set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">That being said the model itself is just perfect. No complaints, love the unobtrusive app features and the overall aesthetic. Did I mention real working suspension? LEGO doesn&rsquo;t include that too often for most sets, but they definitely do it justice here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Octan Gas Pump: This is literally a throw-away side model, it&rsquo;s just a gas pump standing out in the middle of nowhere to refuel. LEGO seriously should have tried to include enough parts for a small station, especially one that could transform into a haunted gas station, but it probably would have upped the piece count out of the price range. Honestly if this was a 30$ set instead of 25$ it might have at least have had a more substantial build so that Scott could stand somewhere and take cash for the gas being used. Oh well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is great. I am a huge fan of Hidden Side, and while I like the haunted transforming ghostly play features and their clever integration, I still like something simple and fun. Jack&rsquo;s Beach Buggy is awesome as a toy, build it, play with it, hunt ghosts. Really the only issue with it is the lack of a decent refuelling station. The single pump is lacking, but nothing you couldn&rsquo;t add on to with some MOCing skills. This is a nice cheap set for the new designs of Parker and Jack, so I highly recommend this one.</p>
