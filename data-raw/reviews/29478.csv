"BelgianBricker","2020-03-31T14:51:38.687Z","It got the looks, but does it got the brains?","<p>I had the chance to snatch this one up at over 60% discount, so, off course, I had to get it. I thought it would sit well with the shrimp shack and shrimp boat from the same series, and I must say it does.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is nothing too special. It is all pretty straight-forward. The lighthouse uses some SNOT-building, but nothing we haven&#39;t seen before. That is not to say the end result isn&#39;t beautiful. I like the overall look of this set: the rocky plateau with its little dockside, the cave, the nicely rounded lighthouse and the way it is placed in an angle on the rocky surface&nbsp;- wow! It all looks very good and attractive, and the looks of this set are one of the things it has going for it.<br />
The inside space is cramped, but that is OK, because all the action is outside, and the surroundings are spacious enough, with lots of places to put your figs and lots of different levels (cave, ground floor, upper floor, deck,...) like in a platform game :)</p>

<p>A few stickers are used, but most of them are not important. I feel like only the sticker on the wooden board of the lighthouse and it&#39;s control panel are needed. The rest can be easily left off without hurting the looks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, are there any bad things? Yes, definitely:</p>

<p>The scooter-thingy is an absolute miss: it looks awful, and should have been left out. It doesn&#39;t add anything to the set and is my least favourite part of it.</p>

<p>The action feature presented near the dockside is executed very poorly: large black axle bars stick out at the back of the set and are highlighted with big bright red technic connectors...urgh...why oh why...</p>

<p>The overall transformation from normal lighthouse to haunted lighthouse is another bad thing: exposing the teeth feels weird because you have to fold out parts of the build, it looks clumsy, feels unnatural, too forced. The evil eye on the top however is an absolute winner (and a beautiful printed piece).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lastly the integration of the colourful APP-tiles is done in a bad way: the gears at the right side of the model are too much in your face, there is no subtlety like in other or previous Hidden Side sets and that is a shame.</p>

<p>All in all I feel that this set is overpriced for what you get. 50&euro; feels like way too much if you compare it to other sets that cost the same amount of money. I am happy I got it for 18&euro; and looking back at it now, I would not have wanted to pay too much for then 18&euro; for this one. This set is not essential, get it if you are a completionist or at discount.</p>
