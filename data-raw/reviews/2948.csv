"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-31T04:50:00Z","BEST PLANE LEGO HAS MADE!!!","This is my favourite Adventures set. Adventures is probably my fav theme (That or Alpha Team). This set is cool because 
(A)The wings are very wide (which means you can use it for a baseplate)
(B)It’s got two opening compartments that could open up and fill with adventures supplies.
There are only two things that could have been better.
(A)More supplies
(B)The propellers keep falling down!!!!!
Apart from that WONDERFUL!

The island hopper has large pontoons to land on water bodies and the large wings are realistic. A nice touch is an inclosed cockpit with a flap to open it. It did occur to me why the heck they put the photographer in the pilots seat, in the ONLY pilots seat! This airplane should seat two but has some good cargo bay space. The props and engines are very real looking and I just cant complain on anything else! A brilliant 10! get it now.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-16T18:00:51Z","Great","I never had my propelers fall down but I did have problems withe the pontoons comng off every time I would land.My brother and I always modify our sets to our specs this one is no different.We took out most of the cargo space,I am talking about the wide part of the cargo bay,we moved the cockpit forword so we could comfortably fit 3 or 4 guys in lego chairs.We made the tail not come off and made it so the wings do not fold up,we also took the pontoons  off but we never put wheals on it(I don't know where it was supposed to land:) All and all it is a good plane and the props add a great touch.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"David1985","2007-11-29T13:20:51.623Z","Best Plane Ever?","Unlike a lot of the new, over-sized planes, 5935 is a classic design, for a very reasonable price of $20.

Everything about this set is perfect, the colors go well, it's a fun build.  There are tons of little details that are nice, like the propellers are attached to an engine that seems to fit the size of the plane.  It comes with a nice, one piece, so called &quot;dinosaur&quot;, but true dinosaurs didn't fly.

The plane also has a good amount of room in it.  The front is obviously the cockpit, and behind that there is a hatch to store a weapon.

And one very important thing that is always great, there is a Lego woman flying the plane!

I have had this set since it came out 7.5 years ago, and I still have it built because it's just a wonderful design that Lego should be proud of.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Cole85459","2007-09-16T19:50:27.857Z","Good","I got this at a yard sale yesterday(I was surprised to see that it had all of the pieces!). It has a nice design but not enough interior room. I had to make it have more.I also like the video camera. The wings fold up (why?). 

Pros:
Good Design
Nice accsesories 
Pterathingy 
BIG propelors and wings
Nice person
Camera!
No Stickers!

Cons:
Needs more stuff (like a pistol or something)
Too much cargo space for such little amount of cargo!
Water-lander-things aren't that stable  
Only one person
No decal

This is a good set. I would buy it.

It has a nice amount of detail, it's fun to build and it looks good not only on the exterior but also on the interior. The dinosaur is cool and the best colour out of all the terrordetox thingys.

"CamberbrickGreen","2019-02-22T23:44:54.353Z","Exploration In Style","<p>The Adventurers take flight here in one of their larger aircraft. I was praying for Indiana Jones sets to happen and so picked this up late as an attractive foray in to the Adventurers theme that did not fulfill&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>[&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;][&middot;&middot;]</strong></p>

<p>Well she is pretty decent but considering the golden age setting and how good some other MFs wre for detail and print at this time, I consider the efforts as good enough. The colours&nbsp;are nice choices, with goggled pilot helmet and she looks better with the gear. To include the gear here, I adore the fat leather backpacks that Lego invented during this time, the film camera has a tile of film image on the side, a slightly inaccurate but nice idea. A gun and shovel appear later for stowage.</p>

<p><strong>Motor Floater</strong><br />
At first it feels as if you are building a boat, though the colour&nbsp;scheme could be a number of things, It definitely suits this&nbsp;era of aviation;white, red and bare metal grey. The cockpit is as you might expect and this six stud wide craft is roomy enough. I love the miniature cargo hold that sits within a strong build: technic brick connections and thick wing and engine mounts. The engines also get a chunky build and hold large wooden propellers. Compare this broadly used brown to today&#39;s most used colour&nbsp;for wood:&nbsp;reddish brown. I know which I prefer&nbsp;and the contrast is quite baffling when you think which colours best represent&nbsp;wood, that is unless you wish everything to look like mahogany? You can shove your gear in the hold now.</p>

<p>The plane gets a opening top two hatches, one with useful handles.The sea plane is intended to visit islands and has big ski-floats. I really like the top surface of the aircraft but find the front anf flat topped nose a bit disappointing and unfinished. It still looks authentic as a shape though. Nice touches are little lights on the wings that actually fold up for security and easy parking of your aircraft. This action adds something to the set and it possesses great play value.</p>

<p>It&#39;s worth noting that the instructions not only have full alternative build details for a really cool boat but also a list of colour&nbsp;illustrated dinosaur information that explains which dinosaurs are in which set. This was a &#39;Lost World&#39; inspired era for Adventurers and it&#39;s why the Pterodactyl is included. You can shove this in the hold too if you like, hmm, lengthways maybe?</p>

<p><strong>Aviatrix</strong><br />
I failed to improve the aeroplane in alternative builds and learnt here that you can not always achieve a better outcome from sets inventory and use every brick. They are usually designed for purpose and the inventory suits just that sometimes. This does not mean someone out there can do it though! Well done Adventurers for producing a very good aeroplane&nbsp;but I feel doubt that this could be my best of theme model.&nbsp;All said a very good building experience and recommended for collection especially if you like aviatrixes too.</p>

"wasn","2012-02-16T07:28:10.883Z"," probably best plane ever","Miss Pipin Reed uses this Waterplane to fly from island to island to film new dinosaurs. <br>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instruction is good you can clearly see what is added, there´s short but good instruction for an alternative modell, an boat <br></p><h4>Parts</h4><p>Good or special parts in this set are the pieces for a six wide boat hull, two big wingplates and two small one, two big brown propellers are also included. You get a old camera and a bagpack. The Dinosaur in the Set is a Pteranodon, its only one part, but looks pretty nice.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You only get the minifigure Pipin Reed, but i think it is enough. <br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Building it is easy, but fun <br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>The comleted model is one of the biggest Airplane without big molds. The three colors are looking good. the Set has some play functions, like the foldable wings or the hold.<br>An other feature,that I like, is the posibility to let the tail and the wings including the engines ""break of"".<br>But there are&nbsp; small cons. probably the biggest is that the usabiltiy of the room inside is very limited. The swimmers on the side fell of easiely, but that is it<br><h4>Summary</h4><p>This is a good set, for kids as well as for AFOLS or TFOLs. It´s good for modding to make it even better.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"LStyer","2011-01-03T21:27:08.98Z","Beautiful set, but it does have its problems.","I took points off on building experience and playability because it doesn't stick together quite as well as I'd like.&nbsp; A better connection between the wing assemblies and the fuselage would have been a big help -- perhaps a few overlapping parts in there.&nbsp; I'm not sure what would have helped those pontoons, but they barely hang on.<br><br>Even so, I gave it an overall rating of four because the concept and look are just so cool.&nbsp; I love LEGO and I love seaplanes.&nbsp; Since this is the best looking LEGO seaplane I've ever gotten my hands on, despite its problems, it's one of my all-time favorite LEGO sets.<br><br>If you dig seaplanes and have a little extra patience, this set is well worth picking up.<br>",TRUE,4,5,3,3,5
"Brelha","2021-06-18T01:37:08.017Z","Some details could be improved","<p>I think this set is pretty cool, and one of the best sets of adventures &quot;dino island&quot;, i bought this just this year, in 2021, after years waiting.<br />
<br />
But, before i continue, i must say (in my humble opinion) that &quot;dino island&quot; is the worst of adventures subtheme.<br />
<br />
Don&#39;t get me wrong, i love adventures set, and Egypt are my favourite theme of all time, but dino island are too juniorized, and i saw this &quot;juniorizing&quot; entering smoothly in jungle subtheme.<br />
Most of dino island sets lack in details, and have some weird designs in many sets. But this set is pretty cool, although I&nbsp;have many considerations. But, what to expect? Most of 2000&#39;s legos are terrible.<br />
<br />
This airplane looks very cool to me, and its almost perfect, despite some details:<br />
<br />
- Could be a printed panel inside the airplane, and there&#39;s room for it right bellow&nbsp;the windscreen.<br />
<br />
- Could be some reforces bricks at the bottom of the airplane, like part&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=2654&amp;idColor=7"">2654</a>, very common in boats base.<br />
<br />
- Could be panels on the 4 windows, I don&#39;t get how they approved a set lacking in this obvious detail.<br />
<br />
- The part&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3008&amp;idColor=1"">3008</a>, 1x8 white brick, could be easily changed by some other solution to make the airplane structure better, for me, this totally kills the design, and looks like amateur stuff. But, what to expect? Most of the sets from 2000 are (for me) terrible in design.<br />
<br />
The grey part&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3039&amp;idColor=9"">3039</a>&nbsp;in the tail, could be replaced by two&nbsp;3045, convex corner, it will look pretty nicer.<br />
<br />
Also, i love the colours of this set, but looks like more &quot;OCTAN&quot; than &quot;adventurer&quot; for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
But, despite all this, for me, its one of the best lego airplanes ever released, and don&#39;t have the cockpit made by one single molded piece.</p>

<p>One gal with a lovely plane.</p>

<p>One of my favourite sets on this line. I searched this on bricklink and got very happy when i bought it.</p>

<p>A nice plane converts into a boat and still doesn&#39;t lose its style.</p>

<p>As the propellers keep falling of (boys...), i did a little modification and inserted an antenna through it attached to a washing machine brick. It got stronger and very realistic because the round top of the antenna was turned out.</p>

<p>Another recomendation if you love all kinds of swooshy things :D</p>
