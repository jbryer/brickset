As I&#39;m not a user of the App that can be used with these hidden side sets I cannot comment on what this does or does not add to that virtual platform but as a set there is not much to it.</p>

<p>The minifigures here are the draw for me with a diver variant of Parker and the inclusion of the new character of Jackson as well as an&nbsp;evil statue. Good to get a slight variant&nbsp;of a&nbsp;shark with new printing around the eye.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is not much to the build and does not have any major transformation or play features. You get an ok build for the sub with an exclusive printed windshield piece but it lacks any great articulation of the arms or spot lights on the vehicle.</p>

<p>I&#39;d&nbsp;recommend this one for the figs and its price point mostly.</p>
