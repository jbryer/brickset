The build process itself was fun, and the level of detail put into each of the figures is phenomenal, nearly a carbon copy of the in-game counterparts. My biggest gripe, however, is the lack of articulation in the Ocelot, namely the legs. I&#39;d like to be able to pose my four-legged friend in a sitting position but the way the legs are constructed, especially the hind legs sitting in an underwell of sorts, makes it so you can&#39;t do anything more than have him standing, as well as the lack of upwards movement&nbsp;in the neck, currently all you can do is make him look forward or straight down. Other than that, though, overall i love this set, i&#39;d recommend it to any fans of brick building.</p>
