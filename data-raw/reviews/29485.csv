<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-0579b97a-7fff-b941-082e-fbd93609457c"">W</b>hile I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Minecraft for nearly a decade, I own very little merchandise of it. This extends to the Lego sets too. In fact, I had never once purchased a Lego Minecraft set before this one. This was definitely mostly an impulse buy, but when I saw the innocent face of that pig on discount no less, I felt it was my duty to purchase <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21157-1/BigFig-Pig-with-Baby-Zombie"">21157-1: BigFig Pig with Baby Zombie</a> (and display it in my room).&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-0579b97a-7fff-b941-082e-fbd93609457c"">T</b><strong>he Minifigures</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-0579b97a-7fff-b941-082e-fbd93609457c"">T</b>here aren&rsquo;t any. I almost never but Lego sets that don&rsquo;t come with at least a couple of minifigures, but this is an exception. I don&rsquo;t think minifigures really make much sense in these Big fig sets anyways, and their inclusion would likely only drive up the price so I&rsquo;m fully in favor of keeping these sets sans minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-0579b97a-7fff-b941-082e-fbd93609457c"">T</b><strong>he Builds</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-0579b97a-7fff-b941-082e-fbd93609457c"">T</b>his set has two main builds, both of which are in the name: the baby zombie and the pig. The baby zombie&rsquo;s construction is quite simple but it comes together nicely and it is able to ride the big, so I think it&rsquo;s a success on the whole. It does have a gray mark on its head from one of the pieces that was used to construct it so that takes away from the look a bit, but considering the baby zombie was seemingly an afterthought in this set I&rsquo;m willing to accept that less parts could be put towards him, especially since he&rsquo;s also to scale with the pig.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-0579b97a-7fff-b941-082e-fbd93609457c"">T</b>he pig is the real star of the show here, and I think he looks great. The pig build is also pretty basic, since he&rsquo;s more or less just a block with legs and a head attached. That said, he&rsquo;s a pink block so that adds some points for me at least. He&rsquo;s also quite accurate to the game, with how the different shades of pink and the intermittent exposed studs are used on his skin. The only area I take issue with is the area around the legs, which uses gray clips to attach the legs to the body. They aren&rsquo;t especially noticeable but it&rsquo;d be nice if Lego could make some more colored clips, though I know that probably was never in the cards for a $15 set. His head also moves on a ball joint, but the shaping of the head conceals it well enough that it isn&rsquo;t easily seen at most angles. The pig just looks good all around and is built quite solidly.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-0579b97a-7fff-b941-082e-fbd93609457c"">B</b>eing such a small set, this set doesn&rsquo;t contain much in the way of new pieces. Or any at all actually. But what it lacks in new pieces it makes up for in its abundance of pink. Pink is a relatively rare color in the Lego world, at least outside of the realm of Lego Friends. Getting so much for this price was pretty cool, though I don&rsquo;t know if it would be cheaper just to order it online if the parts are all you care about.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-0579b97a-7fff-b941-082e-fbd93609457c"">I </b>will say that this set didn&rsquo;t really cause me to gain a sudden appreciation for the Lego Minecraft theme, especially the minifigure scale sets. I don&rsquo;t know whether or not that was the intention, but personally I think these Big Fig sets are aimed at a different market. That&rsquo;s not a bad thing at all, just something I found interesting about the line.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-0579b97a-7fff-b941-082e-fbd93609457c"">Overall</b></p>

<p><b id=""docs-internal-guid-0579b97a-7fff-b941-082e-fbd93609457c"">T</b>here&rsquo;s not a whole lot to say on this one; it&#39;s a nice model of one of Minecraft&rsquo;s most iconic (and cute) creatures, with the baby zombie thrown in for good measure. The assortment of pink parts is also nice, and I overall found it to be a pleasant little set. The PPP is good, and I think that most fans of Minecraft will like it if they are in the market for a nice little decorative piece.</p>
