<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures and mobs</h3>

<p>The only minifigure in the set is the regular Alex, which is a nice inclusion in a smaller set. The ocelot is a nice build with a very nice molded head with printing. It is nice to see the creature in a cheap set as well. The pandas are where the set really shines. You get one baby and one adult panda. I think the baby is the perfect&nbsp;sized panda as I feel like it fits more in minifigure scale. The normal/adult panda is nice too, but I&nbsp;think the body is a little too chunky as when you put the head on, the head looks very small. Overall, all figures in the set are very nice complete models.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p>The build in the set is very nice with the total dimensions being 24x12 studs. i think the stone home/base is nice, but it feels empty. i think a crafting table or a furnace would make it look better and more complete as a home in th Minecraft world. The bamboo is a nice build as well, the use of the 1x1 in sand yellow gives it a more Minecraft feel than if the designers just used bright yellowish green. The use of the new 2x4 jumper tile is very nice although I would&#39;ve used it in a brick yellow. Overall the build is a very nice play and display piece for any LEGO Minecraft fan.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>21158 the panda nursery is a very nice play and display piece with an excellent minifigure choice. I&#39;d rate the set an A- because i think it would&#39;ve been nice to see some printing on the tiles of the mobs.</p>
