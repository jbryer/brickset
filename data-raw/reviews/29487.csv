"Natethegreat101","2020-02-17T13:30:49.307Z","More of a Camp than An Outpost","<p>While this is a not a bad set overall, it is disappointing that the basis of this set&#39;s name is&nbsp;not very covered. In the game, a pillager outpost is a tower. There&#39;s no tower to be found&nbsp;here....</p>

<p>That being said, what the set does include feels&nbsp;is mostly game accurate as little side things that occasionally may show up along with the tower. I don&#39;t recall if the tent area is a thing in game or if that is just something put in place for the purpose of this set. The pricetag of $30 is likely the reason the designers opted not to do a proper tower.</p>

<p>As far as peices go, 2&nbsp;crossbow peices are included for each pillager minifigure&nbsp;and you get 10 of the new for 2020&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6293826/plate-2x4-w-2-knobs"">Plate 2X4, W/ 2 Knobs</a>&nbsp;in bright green. The only other peice worth mentioning is the inclusion of the Brick 1x1x3 in reddish brown, which you get 4 of.</p>

<p>The Iron Golem included is overall better designed and is more durable than the previous version that could be found in 21123 and 21128. I must admit I was surprised by this as I liked the old version and was hesitant about the new design at first.</p>

<p>With 2 pillagers, an Iron Golem, a sheep and knight figure, you have a lot of room for play. My biggest disappointment with this set&nbsp;is the obvious lack of a tower of some sort. The tent is an okay substitution to keep the price down, but I think most people would of rather seen a tower. Despite the negative, I do feel like the set is worth the price for what you get.</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Minecraft has pulled ahead of every other videogame to quickly become the number 1 videogame over the past 10 years. The Lego Group, as always, was quick to cash in on this opportunity. Are the results worth it though? Or has the set quality declined in a rush for money?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h3 style=""margin-top:19px; margin-bottom:6px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Minifigures</span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The eponymous Pillagers make 1 of 2 appearances this year in this set. Arguably, this is better than 21160 The Illager Raid simply because 2 Pillagers are included here as opposed to its 1. If you intended to build a Pillager Army, I would definitely go with this set. These figures are identical and aptly so. Their dark pants are appropriate and their printed torsos are crisp. I especially like their intimidating eyes. The crossbows, however, could have been better molded.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Steve and Alex have been made into minifigures a time or 2 too many. Thankfully, those with a plethora of them can rest assured because a different minifigure is presented as the hero. He is unique to the set and has lovely head and torso printing. Although, I was disappointed to not see any printing on the legs. The shield accessory is remarkably accurate and the axe is flawless. A Minecrafter told me that the knight has markings representing Badlion.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The last &ldquo;minifigure&rdquo; is the &ldquo;damsel in distress&rdquo; an unfortunate Iron Golem who has been&nbsp; captured by the Pillagers. I noticed that this was a new design for Iron Golems over previous sets. However, I am unsure of the necessity for an updated technique. Despite this change, I am quite pleased with how the Iron Golem looks and have no further concerns with its build.</span></span></p>

<h3 style=""margin-top:19px; margin-bottom:6px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Completed Model</span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The main problem with this set is its exclusion of the eponymous &ldquo;outpost&rdquo; which is actually a tower from hence the Pillagers descend. I am baffled as to why this feature was not included nor why it was not made into another set. I would have preferred accuracy to the &ldquo;outpost&rdquo; in question.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The present set is rather quite perfect. I chuckled at the 2 scarecrows/practice dummies for target practice. They are both fine. The spruce tree next to them should be taller, but works well either way. The tent with crafting table and pumpkin often generates at Pillager Outposts so is a welcome inclusion despite having more common Minecraft elements inside. I like the flower too.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The focal point of this set is the cage that can be &ldquo;blown up&rdquo; to free the Iron Golem. The build itself is awfully repetitive, but this is expected considering its source material. The cage should have a top. This was not included to ensure the functionality of the lever. The lever is cleverly integrated and works exquisitely every time. Even though the structure is small, I relish the result.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The outstanding problem with this model is the baseplates on which it sits. They are not firmly attached to one another and tend to hold weak. This means that moving the set can be a logistical nightmare. It often ends up in 4 or 5 pieces. I would recommend displaying it only.</span></span></p>

<h3 style=""margin-top:19px; margin-bottom:6px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Overall</span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">I was doubtful of this set from the beginning. My fears were well-founded, but I am not disappointed by what remains. The figures are all executed thoughtfully and printed pieces are abundant. Therefore, I would still recommend this set. I mean, you can&rsquo;t go wrong with a sheep!</span></span></p>
