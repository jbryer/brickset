"SuperYoshiFan10090","2020-01-08T13:07:22.16Z","A pretty good set","<p>Got this set on Jan 4 2020 along with Taiga Adventures and built it. It looks pretty good and the builds are really nice compared to other sets in this wave and the new Kai skin is really nice along with the other inclusions. Would&#39;ve preferred a Llama over yet another pig but I don&#39;t mind the inclusion. And yes, this set is compatible with the older sets in mind. My only complaint is that if I wanted a more central layout of the 3 models together, the door in the house can&#39;t fully open and you&#39;re pratically forced to use the layout that the set recommends which limits creativity. Other than that, I can recommend this set.</p>
