"mrmitch","2007-06-11T02:04:47.67Z","Set is one of the best priced Jungle set you can get","Wide variety of colors in this set makes it stand out on the shelf. Like the car, figures are good, nice to have a skelton and the camera person. Silver knives a plus, spiderweb is cool and I really like the preprinted tall blocks with ancient people on them. This is a very playable set, my daughter and I spent hours playing with this and our many other Advernture LEGO sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-05T10:35:00.483Z","LEGO Adventurers (Jungle) - Spider's Secret Review","This set may be small but you get lot's of stuff in there. For example we get a car which has an extra tyre on the back and behind the seats is a place where you can hide the map. The piece with the seats is so big that you can put in two minifigs in this vehicle. We also get some nice accessories like a camera with a tripod, a red mug and a campfire. The main attraction of this set is probably the tomb. It really has a cool design and I love the way how LEGO printed those walls on the front. On the front you can also see a spider web and inside of this temple you can see the shiny gold sun disk which is protected by an axe which you can drop on the enemies when they want to get this piece. There're no stickers to worry about and I also can't complain about the number of minifigs.<br><br>The minifigs are very cool as well. We get Miss Gail Storm in the green vest and the sun helmet and we also get Senor Palomar in his white suit who also comes with a white cowboy hat. This set is great to have for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"AETerry","2010-11-19T00:23:51.743Z","Spider's Secret Review","<p>The Adventurer's theme is clearly Lego's answer to Indiana Jones before they were able to liscense a deal with Lucasfilms.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is just chalked full of accessories and little details with two minifigures exploring Jungle Ruins and getting photos of their finds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's just awesome for a set this small to have all these details in it.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5
"Nesquik","2012-12-10T15:57:42.43Z","Lego at its best...","Some Lego products can just define what is so good about the system in the first place: 5936 'Spider's Secret' is one of those rare releases.&nbsp;<div><br></div><div>The strength of the Adventurers theme as a whole was that it opened up so many possibilities for storytelling without the need for an expensive license, something that ironically saved The Lego Group's fortunes in the early 2000's, and yet have saturated the product paradigm almost stir-crazily.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>In Adventurers, we take part in the characters role playing across many different cultures and aspects of history - 5936 was a part of the Amazonian influence that was used from 1999. The next result of this is something different, exciting and vibrant. Dare I say it, this is one of the most underrated Lego sub-themes to have ever existed.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>5936 witnesses our two intrepid explorers as the investigate a small monument deep in the jungle. It may look safe once you wince past the nasty creatures, but don't be fooled - a trap awaits! Our skeleton friend is the warning sign of how a wrong move could bring a blow to the head... Ouch.</div><div><br></div><div>Monument aside, the set comes with the three mentioned minifigures and a very nice little vehicle that is suited to normal terrain. It seems a strange choice at first having a road car in the jungle, but its classic look is touching on the golden age of archeology rather than up-to-date equipment. Our explorers also have plenty of fantastic accessories, a fire and a camera to record the action.</div><div><br></div><div>The amount of printed pieces you get this set (and the absolute absence of stickers) is simply incredible. The attention to detail should not go unnoticed, particularly on the grey columns with their gorgeous shiny printing in many colours, and the smaller map. In fact, the product as a whole is filled with so many great little components that you're invited to re-use them at your own will.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>While the car is purposefully basic for ease of build and rebuild (great for younger children), the monument has glorious use of colour and is a bit more intricate. It just stands out as something of importance, but at the same time intrigue. This merely proves that colour can affect Lego design just as much as the choice of components.</div><div><br></div><div>Indeed, it's a great pity that The Lego Group has chosen not to continue this theme, for it is both economical and beautiful. The narratives are far, far more open than the licensed products that we're ""treated"" to these days, and overall this greatly adds to the value of the product more so than the rarity of components or minifigures. I sincerely hope Adventurers make a return one day.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Cake_Crafted","2016-05-13T13:48:06.367Z","So much for a small size","<p>This is a really great set. You get a lot packed in for the small size</p>

<p>3 minifigures come with the set. The hero Pippin Reed, the villain, Senor Palomor and a typical floppy armed skeleton, all very nice figures.</p>

<p>You also get a campfire and movie camera with a printed tile inside as well as a snake and two spiders (of course)</p>

<p>The car is very similar to others from this theme but personally I don&#39;t think it looks quite as good as it is less detailed but is still a nice build</p>

<p>Finally on to the main model. Underneath the spider web are two printed bricks which look great. The treasure is guarded by an axe which can be swung down by removing the piece at the back. I found building the roof a bit annoying as it kept falling apart but apart from that the building experience was good.</p>

<p>Overall I really like this set. The amount you get for such a small size is really excellent. The only problem I have with the set is the price it goes for. I was trying to get one for a decent price for a long time. However if you can get it for a good price it is definitely worth it</p>

<p><strong>Overall rating: 4/5</strong></p>

"Fauch","2014-11-27T19:28:18.943Z","Lots of stuffs","<p>For a set this small, this has a lot. A car, a temple, 3 minifigs, camera, leaves, backpack, magnifying glasses, snake, spider, scorpion, golden idol, lots of printed bricks (statues are great), a nice big mold with the car seats, etc... I don&#39;t remember the price but it was probably&nbsp;around 100F / 15&euro;, I could rarely afford to spend more when I was a child.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Tons of good parts for such a small set. Many of them may&nbsp;be quite common now, but in 1998, a lot of them were brand new.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>3 minifigs including the skeleton, it is decent. For 1998, they were quite good.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Nothing hard</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>It is small of course, but it looks good. the temple has nice colors and prints. The spider web adds to the set.</p>
