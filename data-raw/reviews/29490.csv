Plus having the new fox and another wolf is good. the fox could look better but i cant complain. the TNT feels too overused in these&nbsp;new sets and the smaller ones so i feel a different contraption could have been used. otherwise the set is great and i recccomend it.</p>

There is nothing overly special about this set, but at&nbsp;$10, it is a fantastic impulse Minecraft set that&nbsp;is both accurate to the source material and is a great value.</p>

<p>2 minifigures, in the form of a Steve and a skeleton, are included along with&nbsp;an untamed wolf and the obvious star of the set:&nbsp;a fox. I also appreciate the inclusion of&nbsp;the new berry bushes. A small yet simple TNT play feature that has been used before appears again.</p>

<p>Peices included that are rare or new include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>2x - Dark Orange 2x4 plate w/ 2 knobs&nbsp;</li>
	<li>1x - Molded Fire peice (used for the burning effect in Minecraft)</li>
	<li>2x - Sand Green 6x6 plate</li>
	<li>1x - Sand Green 2x4 plate</li>

<p>It is disappointing to see Steve yet again, but at least he has some gold armor to distinguish the figure from other Steve figures.&nbsp;</p>

That being said, it&rsquo;s nice to see this price range carrying on with such a fun little set. I&rsquo;m not as familiar with game elements, but I suppose that is to be expected. That out of the way, let&rsquo;s discuss this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Minecraft Theme seems to still have the same basic design for packaging, though it feels as if it has evolved a bit since the beginning. I do enjoy the look of this smaller box and the manual is very well designed and hasn&rsquo;t been creased or folded because it is a small booklet rather than a pamphlet design. Everything looks great, the showcase of the set is definitely well done as well showing off the features and build. Overall a really great package design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A nice selection of parts in this set, with some great plant parts and a brand new &lsquo;spawn point&rsquo; brick. Or at least what I am thinking is meant to be a Spawn Point. Everything in this set is really great.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Skeleton: This appears to be a common foe this year in sets, it&rsquo;s pretty much a basic LEGO skeleton with square head instead of round. Pixelated looking bow and arrow accessories also seem to be common with this character, they must be archers so long range foes. Overall, pretty decent figure.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Steven: This version of Steven is actually different from previous versions I&rsquo;ve gotten, I didn&rsquo;t notice this at first, but Steven here is wearing gold pants instead of purple, so I&rsquo;m assuming he&rsquo;s dressed in protective gold armour for his legs? He&rsquo;s got a Gold Sword at least, his print is the same as always though.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Fox: This buildable animal is the Fox. So where&rsquo;s the Taiga? I am not sure, but it&rsquo;s a pretty awesome build and I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with the unique elements introduced for the animal&rsquo;s head. Minecraft always has such interesting blocky creature designs.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Wolf: Ok I&rsquo;m not sure if this is actually a wolf or just a regular dog, but I&rsquo;m sticking with Wolf because it&rsquo;s grey and looks much more menacing. Perhaps this creature is a pet or possibly an enemy. Really enjoy the look and build of this character, could definitely see buying multiples of the parts just to have a small army to attack with.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build &amp; The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This model build isn&rsquo;t much to discuss, unlike larger Minecraft sets this is mostly a small section of terrain. This model&rsquo;s build was relatively quick and easy, also we have an exploding feature in the finished model designed to launch some of said terrain for some reason. Maybe searching for some material. This model isn&rsquo;t too bad for this set, I think most people are buying the set for the Minifigures and Creature Builds though.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set isn&rsquo;t terrible, it is somewhat nice for what you get and fans of the game will probably enjoy it immensely as a nice add-on for some of the larger sets. Overall though I&rsquo;m a bit unimpressed with this honestly, compared to the small sets I missed out on last year I feel that this set could have had a bit more to it. I like the Minecraft Mushroom build, or what I assume is a mushroom build as part of the terrain, and I love the creatures and characters included here. That Spawn Point element is also really highly impressive, I&rsquo;m not sure if it&rsquo;s new in 2020 or was in previous sets, I haven&rsquo;t bought a whole lot of Minecraft I&rsquo;m afraid.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Would I recommend this set? Yes. While I felt a bit underwhelmed by it I still see value in the set, so I definitely think you more knowledgeable game players will love this set. Recommended for Fans.</p>

"captcrouton","2021-06-21T14:18:23.2Z","Bought it to trade minifigures","<p>This was the cheapest set at Walmart with the most minifigures.&nbsp; I bought it so that I could trade the minifigures at Legoland Florida, which is a really fun experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s a terribly ugly set that will just be thrown into spare parts.&nbsp; But at Legoland I was even able to swap a couple animals for normal minifigures, so it was a worthy purchase.</p>

<p>Truly, I think Minecraft sets are pretty reminiscent of MOCs of small children. They&#39;re always blocky and clunky looking.&nbsp; But if you like 2 x 2 jumper plates and bricks, it&#39;s a great way to go.</p>

"Minifig290","2020-05-24T14:31:19.7Z","Almost perfect Minecraft battle pack","<p>Hello all, today I&#39;ll be taking a look at my first ever LEGO minifigure scale Minecraft set the 21162 Taiga Adventure set which was released in January 2020 for &pound;8.99/$9.99 and contains 74 pieces giving a price per part of 12p/13c. This set includes 2 figures, 2 mobs and one main build. Let&#39;s take a look at this set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Firstly I&#39;m going to take a look at the minifigures and mobs that are included in this set, starting with the main character Steve:</p>

<p><strong>Steve:</strong> There is a Steve figure who is probably one of the most common LEGO figures in existence rn but this figure is exclusive for his combination of parts used. His head piece is printed onto a block head used exclusively for Minecraft. His dark azure torso which has been in over 30 sets has a small blocky print around his neck. Finally, what really makes him exclusive is his pearl gold unprinted legs but this piece has been in 16 sets including 4 Minecraft ones.</p>

<p><strong>Skeleton: </strong>Another very common figure in the LEGO Minecraft world this skeleton in his combination of parts has been in 11 sets, he has his simplistically printed white blocky head piece which has been in 14 sets and the bog standard lego skeleton body piece with two white arms attached and two white legs at the bottom.</p>

<p><strong>Wolf: </strong>Now something more unique a wild wolf which has a newly printed exclusive head piece that is made specially for Minecraft sets on its snout there is some tan printed with some black for its nose and mouth above that there are two rectangular prints for his blocky eyes which makes him look cross-eyed. The build for its body has a 1x2 dark grey plate to represent the fact he isn&#39;t a tamed wolf. Its legs are made using two light grey 1x2 bricks with grove also there is a tale made using a 1x2 plate with hinge which is attached to a 1x2 plate with a clip.</p>

<p><strong>Fox:</strong> Finally a true exclusive character the fox which hasn&#39;t been in a Minecraft set until now, using the fairly uncommon ocelot head piece in orange the fox head piece is printed with a white snout and a small black square for its nose, its eyes are similar to what the wolf has but are topped with a small line of dark red printing. Its body is built using mostly plates like the wolf but has a brown 1x1 plate with hinge to attach its brick built tale using a 1x1 brick in orange 1x1 plate in white and brown 1x1 clip. Its feet are just simply a 1x1 orange plate with a black stud underneath.</p>

<p><strong>Accessories</strong></p>

<p>To go with our figures are some small accessories. The most interesting one for me is a pearl gold sword which to date is only in 9 sets the cheapest otherwise being the &pound;13 Nether Fight set which now is quite an expensive set on the after market. This sword is Steve&#39;s but the Skeleton has its blcoky Bow and Arrow accessory in brown which has been in 17 sets to date. Steve and the Skeleton can swap weapons for an increasing&nbsp;battle.</p>

<p><b>Build</b></p>

<p>Now there is one main build made of very few pieces. The bulk of the build is made using 3 6x6 plates, 2 in Sand green and one in brown connected together with a small mound that has a play feature of blowing up thanks to a TNT block. When a 2x4 tile is pushed a small build of two dirt blocks and a stone block fly off. Around the mound are two 2x2 jumper plates with some flowers in and a small red mushroom build consisting of a white stud topped with a 1x1 red plate. I also want to note a new 2x4 jumper plate that has two studs which is in a dark nougat that is now for 2020.</p>

<p>The TNT block is a very common build being in 16 sets, this block is made of two 1x2 white bricks printed with TNT topped with a 2x2 red jumper and has a 2x2 red plate and 2x2 black round plate underneath. There is also an interesting fire piece which has only been in 3 set that you can put either the Skeleton or Steve in. This fire piece is dual moulded and quite useful.</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Well although small this set is an almost perfect battle pack for minecraft apart from the issue of if you brought say 10 of these you&#39;d have alot of unwanted Steve figures other than that you could make a small map out of the parts in 10 of these sets. Plus there are some incredible parts like the fire, 2x4 jumper plate and 6x6 sand green plates. Though, I do have to say the printing on the Fox&#39;s face is a bit derpy.</p>

<p>I think this would make a perfect small treat or pocket money toy, also would make a decent small birthday gift. The price of &pound;8.99/$9.99 makes it a fairly priced set when you consider getting 2 figures and two mobs plus a small scenery build.</p>

<p><strong>Pros - </strong>Great selection of parts, generous amount of figures, decent play feature, perfectly priced</p>

<p><strong>Cons -</strong> The foxes face print has been noted to look a bit derpy by many including myself</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The taiga adventure , being a name I don&#39;t fully understand is a nice build with more interesting brick built characters than actual minifigures .</p>

<p>The Minifigures-</p>

<p>The Steve fig has a specially moulded head which is printed on one side , a plain but accurate torso and some imprinted pearl gold legs plus a gold sword for an accessory , the skeleton has the same specially moulded head with a different print , the body and arms are standard skeleton parts and normal legs his accessory is a bow and arrow . The brick built characters include a fox with a specially moulded head with exclusive printing , a plain straight forward build for the body , some legs and an articulated tail , the wolf also has a specially moulded head , a brick built body , some legs and another articulated tail .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>build is on three 6&times;6 plates featuring a mound with catapult play feature using a tile and some hinges , there is also a printed Minecraft TNT box and a flower in the side , on a different part of the build there is a flower stalk build also used again in a different area , there are these very interesting 2&times;4 dark orange jumpers with just two studs used to connect the plates together and finally there is a great mould for a flame / fire area for the skeleton in the iconic Minecraft blockiness .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a good set but my lack of interest in the source material does influence my verdict but being paired with my other Minecraft set chicken coop it looks quite good so I do recommend it to anyone but mainly if you are a Minecraft fan another reason I got it was because I now have Alex and Steve but it will probably be my last Minecraft set as I am more interested in other themes .</p>

"ICAbricks","2022-01-18T19:17:03.13Z","Not the biggest Minecraft set - but hey, it has a wolf!","<p>I recently got The Taiga Adventure as an early Christmas present. It&#39;s a cute little set, but doesn&#39;t have a lot of play value. Let&#39;s look at the minifigures first.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Steve has appeared in lots of Minecraft sets before, but it&#39;s nice to get his gold leggings in a small set. He comes with a golden sword.</li>
	<li>The skeleton has also appeared in numerous sets, but it&#39;s also nice to get him in a cheaper set. He has a bow and arrow, as well as a 2x2 flame piece to simulate burning up in daylight.</li>
	<li>The wolf is an untamed one, but he&#39;s still cute. Plus, unless you count hostile wolves, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve gotten an untamed wolf in a set before. I&#39;m just happy to get a wolf because they&#39;re my favourite animal, both in-game and IRL.</li>
	<li>Foxes are a semi-newish addition to Minecraft, and this one looks cute. People complain about the head being too long because it is a reprint of the cat/ocelot head. However, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any worse than the giant item frames or three-block-long beds, TBH. He&#39;s kinda cute, actually.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build is a small section of the taiga biome.With no trees, it&#39;s not particularly exciting. The only feature is a TNT explosion, a feature that seems overused with these $10 sets. Here are my pros and cons for this set:</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Berry bushes and mushroom add nice detail.</li>
	<li>I like how they used sand green for the way grass looks in the taiga.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Like most other Minecraft sets, the parts can be (more or less) rearranged to make a different scene.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
	<li>Only play feature is TNT, which is BORING and way overused.</li>
	<li>No trees, but I guess they&#39;d be hard to fit into a set this small.</li>
	<li>Flame seems out of place.</li>
</ul>

<p>All in all, this is a cute little set that little kids would like. If I were you, though, I&#39;d probably get it for the minifigures and TNT block, but that&#39;s about it. I do love the wolf, though, and the set could inspire some fun alternate builds. I hope LEGO does more taiga sets in the near future. But overall, this set is kinda just... adequate. It is a good way to get a skeleton and wolf, though. So my overall rating is 3/5.</p>
