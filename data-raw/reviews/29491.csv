"AMP12345","2020-01-05T21:06:09.407Z","Great Evolution for Speed Champions","<p>I will admit I was a bit skeptical when we found out that Speed Champions was changing scale. I love cars and all of my Speed Champions are in a display cabinet together. While the mix of scales may look a bit strange on my shelf until I&nbsp;get more of the new ones this model is so good looking all of my reservations are gone. The size is great and provides so much more detail. The building experience was fun and took me a good amount of time compared to the older speed champions that were kind of all the same. Though the new build experience might start to feel repetitive&nbsp;as well, this is just my first 8 stud wide car.</p>

<p>If you are a collector and skeptical of the new size, go for it&nbsp;the better shaping and overall design is worth it. And if you haven&#39;t&nbsp;been collecting&nbsp;Speed Champions before now is the time to start. I expect this new line of 8 stud cars will continue to provide superior design and building experience.</p>

"BallBuster","2020-01-11T17:23:48.273Z","Much Improved ","<p>I only got into building and collecting Lego because I baught a Speed Champion car a few years ago.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have noticedan improvement in the builds through the years, and this latest Ferrari is my Favourite. With the added 2 studs in width, the Lego team managed to add so much more detail in the car.</p>

<p>More curves, more slopes, more printed parts. (I don&#39;t like to add stickers to my builds) , and finally space for 2 minifigs inside the car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The car is very well constructed and I guess it would survive a drop from a coffee table without exploding into a hundred pieces. There are very few exposed studs, and the curves and flat tiles create a fery smoot exterior surface on the car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would have loved a set of unique rims to go with the new roof-piece, but that is just me.(I also never use the hubcaps and leave the rims exposed)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking foreard to building the rest of the new Speed Champions.</p>

"Sobel","2020-07-02T22:13:25.777Z","An almost perfect depicting of an almost perfect sports car!","<p>With all the new Submarine Explorer sets from the City theme just having been released, I for sure am hungry for some new LEGO. Unfortunately, those have no good discounts yet, so I&#39;ll have to wait a little longer. In the meantime, I found a great deal here on this site and got me this Set and the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76897-1/1985-Audi-Sport-Quattro-S1"">76895&nbsp;</a>for only 13&euro; each. And I guess, now I found myself a huge fan of the Speed Champions...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Again, sooo many small parts, perfect for modelling a difficult shape, like the Ferrari&#39;s. Of course, the dominant colour is red, what else. A new part to me was the extremely aerodynamic glass roof, which nicely resembles the real car&#39;s cockpit. Like the set mentioned above, this car also has switchable rims/hubcaps. Luckily, there are less stickers to apply, twelve&nbsp;in total. There are also some nicely printed parts, notably two 1x1 plates with a tiny Ferrari logo printed on one SIDE!</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One driver is included. He has a two-sided head, curly hair, like a real Italian, a helmet and a wrench. Unfortunately, he always has to wear the helmet, when driving, because he won&#39;t fit in the cockpit with his hair part on.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Again a build from bottom to top, but this one holds a little twist when building the front part. By using bricks with knobs to the sides and others, the middle section of the hood is on a slightly lower level than the rest - which fits perfectly to the design of the actual car. The car body comprises a lot of very small elements, so a care is advised when building it. Luckily, enough spare parts are supplied.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Of course, this set is all about design and resembling the original, so there are no functions for me to describe, just looks. The finished model stands at&nbsp;around 16 cm in length, 7 cm in width and only 4 cm in height. It looks very sportive, has some decently placed stickers and makes very good use of sloped bricks to shape the car. The cockpit has room for two and has a steering wheel, black seats and some sort of middle console. This car model has rearview mirrors, which do not very much resemble the actual ones (difficult, of course). The large glass cockpit is super flat and a very, very tight fit with the head of the driver. The car has no actual headlights, but headlight stickers - Lightning McQueen, is that you??</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>What we have here is yet another VERY cool looking Speed Champions model. So stream-lined, so elegant, so RED! It catches a lot of the Ferrari-feeling! The same time, it is robust and sturdy and can surely withstand some rough playing. Again, the switchable hubcaps are a nice gimmick, the large cockpit screen looks awesome and all the stickers and prints fit so very well.<br />
Still, this model does not totally manage to capture the slender, elegant, powerful and at the same time almost&nbsp;fragile look of the actual car. I admit, it is VERY difficult to reproduce a car with so many curves and a wavy silhouette&nbsp;with LEGO parts. The designers did absolutely great, yet the front is quite bulky and not as flat as the original car.<br />
But nonetheless, it is an awesome model, surely nice to play with and even nicer to display with some more sets of this great series!</p>

"elangab","2020-06-05T21:18:31.91Z","Worth considering even if you're not a fan of cars","<p>Disclaimer - I don&#39;t care about sports/luxury cars. A Honda SUV, for me, evokes the same emotional respond as a Lamborghini. With that out of the way, I&#39;ll review this great little set.</p>

<p>This is my second &quot;Speed Champions&quot; set, the first one was 75891, which I got on sale because I loved the colours and thought it will look nice in my Lego City. If you never had a &quot;Speed Champion&quot;&nbsp; set before and only built &quot;Lego City&quot; cars, it&#39;s not the same at all. The closest &quot;Lego City&quot; car is 60239. These cars are robust, smooth and are using unique building style that&#39;s challenging to build and lots of fun.</p>

<p>I saw 76895 on sale and thought it would be nice to test drive the 8 studs wide cars from that series. As much as I loved 75891, I think 76895 is much better and for only $5 more it&#39;s a great value and investment for your collection.</p>

<p>The dominant colour is red, as you can see, and consist of smaller bricks&nbsp;much more than larger ones which could be nice if you&#39;re looking for these parts for your MOC. The car is wide, but not too wide to feel weird. It&#39;s robust enough of a build to actually play with it and allowing it to bump into things when shooting it forward without falling apart upon collision.</p>

<p>The build itself is a bit challenging as you need to pay attention to the smaller parts, and there were numerous &quot;why did they put this here ? Oh... now I see&quot; moments, and it gave some nice ideas for MOCs. There were few stickers, which I&#39;m not a fan of as some of them were quite small, but for the price - all is good. There are also some printed parts, so it was a good balance (much better than the sticker heavy&nbsp;75891). Building time was about half an hour or so.</p>

<p>Minifigure was included, with both helmet and hair to choose from. There isn&rsquo;t a dedicated place to put the other head piece, sadly. Minifigure is OK, nothing special.</p>

<p>There were actually a surprising amount of extra parts which is always nice.</p>

<p>Will I be collecting SC theme line&nbsp;? I don&#39;t think so, but I will buy one now and then when it&#39;s on sale to add to my layout.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re a collector of this theme, I&#39;m sure you already got this one. If you&#39;re new to this theme, or never tried its 8 wide cars - I highly recommend this little set!</p>

"sct","2020-08-04T10:44:22.663Z","A awesome-looking car and a pretty good Lego set","<p>The overall 5 stars from me is for looks only. The model looks awesome. From afar, it can be mistaken for a normal car model, like a large hot wheels, and only when you get close to&nbsp;it, you discover that &ldquo;Hey, it&#39;s Lego! Awesome!&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Building experience was OK. The model is based on one large brick that forms the chassis and from it&nbsp;you slowly build the suspension and body. There&#39;s a lot of small parts that make the model look great and detailed, but are somewhat hard to fit in and align correctly.</p>

<p>The model consists of quite a lot of parts, but their reusability is quite low. I daresay you would not be able to build anything else based on parts from this set than this car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The playability is quite low. When my 2 KFOLs played with it a lot of parts detached and I kept having to reattach it every minute or so. I think that this model is mostly for display, not playing.</p>

<p>Value for money - it&#39;s not an expensive set and it looks great. I give five, because I bought it mostly for the looks. If you want it for a different reason, the grade would probably be lower.</p>

"Zapp_Brannigan","2020-12-27T22:41:13.857Z","8 Stud Wide Cars Start Off Strong","<p>With few exceptions, Lego vehicles were typically never designed to have a passenger accompany the driver. Starting this year, however, Lego has decided to pioneer the development of two-occupant cars&nbsp;in the Speed Champions theme. This entailed the introduction of 8 stud wide cars, which not only meant an increase in passenger capacity, but also additional detail and more realistic proportioning could be captured.</p>

<p>One of these sets is 76895 Ferrari F8 Tributo. I personally chose this set because, well, it just looks like a darn cool car (and red cars go faster anyway)! All the curved pieces which eventually amount to a fully unified&nbsp;sleek shape of the car are judiciously placed to give local details and contours. The building techniques employed to make such construction possible are a testament to increased innovation and creativity&nbsp;seen not only in Speed Champions sets, but also other AFOL-oriented themes.</p>

<p>A new chassis piece, introduced this year, is included to accomodate the widening.</p>

<p>Stickers are present but relatively few, including the front hood logo and headlights. However, the side 1x1 plates have the Ferrari logo printed on which is amazing; a spare is even included.</p>

<p>The set comes with one dual-expression minifigure. He has a helmet as well as ordinary hair piece. A customary wrench is included as well. Two types of rims come with the set and can be swapped out to the builder&#39;s liking.</p>

<p>A common problem noted by many people is&nbsp;the windscreen cannot be fully secured with the driver in place. This is certainly true if the driver has his hair on; however, a noticeable offset in flushness (about a millimetre) is also present even when his helmet is on. This problem can be improved if you remove the 1x2 black bricks under the 1x2 tiles with handles acting as the seats. This gives the minifigures a bit more room to lean back on, thus lowering their head height and resulting in about a half millimetre lowering of the offset ridge between the car roof and windscreen. While not fully eliminating the problem, this provides increased flushness and the 0.5 mm ridge is practically unnoticeable. A quick check of the other Speed Champions set I own, the McLaren Senna, showed that this windscreen-roof offset was also present, though hardly noticeable.</p>

<p>At $25 this set is an excellent deal and sets a solid groundwork for future 8 wide cars. I recommend it to any Speed Champions or Ferrari fans.</p>

"Karrot","2020-11-04T03:20:28.627Z","Smooth, sleek build in red","<p>The front box-art really doesn&#39;t do this model justice. With its smooth exterior it looks and feels like a replica car, and then when you get closer you&#39;ll see the trademark studs and realise it is a LEGO set.</p>

<p><strong>Build: </strong>Took about an hour of relaxed building time. Bag 1 constructs the rear, and Bag 2 finishes the front. I like the new black 6x12x1 black chassis piece for the wider Speed Champions models. Having built the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75892-1/McLaren-Senna"">75892 McLaren Senna</a> last year, this one has much better proportions. During the build, there were moments where plates were one stud higher or lower than those around it, which briefly felt unsatisfying until I stepped back and realised it added a nice curvature to the model.&nbsp;An alternative set of wheel rims are provided if you prefer them.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong>&nbsp;The driver squeezes inside the low vehicle only with his helmet (he can&#39;t wear his nice spiky hairpiece). One thing that could change with the new car sizes is an updated off-set steering wheel, as the classic one is now out of line with the centre of the driver&#39;s body. As for the minifig himself, he has a nice Ferrari logo on his shirt under a jacket, and comes with a trustworthy screwdriver/ spanner piece.</p>

<p><strong>Completed Build:&nbsp;</strong>The model itself has some really nice stickers throughout for the licence plate, headlights and hood. Thankfully, the canopy is a printed piece. I thought I spotted a flat 1x1 red tile with a printed Ferrari logo on its side, but it must&#39;ve disappeared into the build.</p>

<p>The car itself looks beautiful, and I feel the rear images on the box-art do a better job of capturing it than the front. Even when looking top-down at it, it looks spectacular.&nbsp;In-fact, I liked the box&#39;s black sides as it gives that adult, professional vibe, especially with the &ldquo;Ferrari Official Licensed Product&rdquo; logos. Obviously this is still a LEGO and Speed Champions set so the front box-art gives a bit more of an artistic representation. Also, the model is significantly smaller than the box it comes in, but is packed with pieces and just feels solid despite its light weight.</p>

<p>And how good is to comfortably sit two minifigures in the car!</p>

"funfauto","2021-05-30T19:12:53.343Z","Suprising and interesting","<h3>INTRO</h3>

<p>Without much of an interest in cars, this jumps out as it looks interesting from an assembly point of view, looking like very promising looking LEGO model.</p>

<h3>FIGURES</h3>

<p>One figure is included, being &quot;Ferrari driving man&quot; . With a unique torso print, a jacket and Ferrari logo shirt, with sharp colours and very precise metallic zip highlights. Additionally comes with a helmet as well as a hair piece, which makes complete sense and is a good inclusion.</p>

<h3>BUILD</h3>

<p>It starts off with a very large specialised chassis element, which is required to hang all of the various complex assemblies onto. This complexity is communicated so well in the instructions that it is never confusing, despite assemblies rotating around, going upways and sideways and downways, using SNOT to its full ability. The rear exhaust is attached at a right angle relative to the main chassis. It uses the rear attachment points of lamp/headlight elements to have the underside of the red bumper assembly face up, allowing the next level of parts to be right next to it, making a seamless final product. This is attached via 1x2 brackets onto the chassis element, spacing it off just enough to allow for the bottom of the wheel arch to fit in precisely, with no gap.</p>

<p>Similar design style is seen on the front, with the internal structure based on a chain of specialised SNOT pieces, with brackets and modified bricks resting on a smooth interior channel. All is attached securely at every stage, with no risk of disintegration while building. This allows for using the thickness of a bracket overhang to push a section of the bonnet up just enough to match the top and bottom of curved elements on the exterior assembly to produce a seamless slope.</p>

<p>It is awkward to describe just how well complex methods are used and communicated. The building experience was surprising and satisfying for this reason ; noticing and appreciating how much pinpoint design went into the innards, never to be seen again, to support an exterior that reaches a way above average level of fit and finish.</p>

<p>Larger specialised elements are used, including the windscreen which is printed with red that is only just off the brick red colour, alongside 1x1 plates with tiny but completely legible Ferrari badges on the side of the plate, allowing for use of a print to show an otherwise oft-missed detail.</p>

<h3>CRITICISMS</h3>

<p>Looking at some pictures of the real thing, this is not an exact replica, but is quite close. This includes the front which is a bit too chunky and the back a bit too boxy. It seems like the whole thing has been stretched too tall by just a bit. So in terms of being a display replica, it is most of the way there at this scale, which as aforementioned allows for great precision.</p>

<p>Not a full criticism, a heavy use of stickers might dissuade some from using them at all. Without stickers this is still a fairly good model, with the stickers adding little connections and highlights.</p>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3>

<p>At this pricepoint, this gives you an in-depth and varied building experience at a substantial scale. This also gives a mostly correct model of a car for those interested. It is also a demonstration of how much LEGO can manage to do, showing levels of precision that is uncommon to see outside much larger sets.</p>

<p>This is a great model, with the advantage of also being an excellent LEGO kit.<br />
