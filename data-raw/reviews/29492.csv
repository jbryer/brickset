"HeadFax","2020-04-28T00:18:36.18Z","Speed Champions 2.0","<p>This was the first of the newer, larger Speed Champions sets that I purchased. I feel like the change in scale was a double-edged sword, with some benefits conferred at the cost of some compromises made.</p>

<p>I like that the sets are now large enough to sit two minifigs side by side. While the older SC sets retain the level of detail and verisimilitude required of them, it was always a gripe that they were only large enough for a solo driver. The fact that two minifigs can now sit side by side enhances the realism of the set by a significant degree.</p>

<p>However, this decision came with a cost. The new &quot;chassis&quot; plate that the sets are based on is 6 pips wide, but the sunken seating area cuts out an extra pip for a total width of 5 instead of 6. Consequently, the dashboard employs a trick of offsetting 6x1 plates onto the 5-pip baseplate to eliminate gaps around the edges, but this means that the driver and steering wheel don&#39;t line up properly. This also presents as an issue with the roof/windshield piece, which now no longer &quot;seals&quot; properly; there is a considerable gap between the window and door on each side. This possibly could have been eliminated by over-engineering the door design, but in its present state it simply looks a little slipshod. Ultimately I feel that this is caused by the fact that the vehicle&#39;s interior, built&nbsp;on the reduced seating area size, isn&#39;t fully compatible with the vehicle&#39;s exterior.</p>

<p>In terms of the exterior, however, I have to admit that the detail is exquisite. I am especially fond of the taillights; the outer lights are raised ever so slightly in a way that clearly mimics the real-life counterpart. Similarly, the fact that the hood angles down ever so slightly was a nice touch.</p>

<p>The last thing I think worth mentioning about the build is the spoiler. Most of the SC sets I have bought have had movable spoilers held on with clips. This spoiler is fixed and is merely stacked on top of two columns of 1x1 pips. This means that it&#39;s not only less fun to play with, but it&#39;s also a particularly flimsy way of attaching a piece that&#39;s inevitably going to fall off.</p>

<p>Finally, this set went completely overkill on the stickers. Stickers are easily my least favorite recent Lego innovation (recent relative to the early 90s when I began collecting, anyway), and the 26(!) stickers needed for this car is just a completely excessive amount for a set this size.</p>

<p>Overall, this set is good, but not great. I&#39;d love it if future SC sets retain this scale, but I&#39;d appreciate it if extra attention could be paid to ensuring fluidity between the sets&#39; interiors and exteriors.</p>

"TeddytheSpoon","2021-02-02T20:36:43.537Z","First Japanese Speed Champions car sets a low bar","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The build: </b>the usual formula for Speed Champions: lots of SNOT (yay!) and lots of stickers (boo). There are one or two interesting techniques (namely for the tail lights and front &lsquo;cheeks&rsquo;), but whereas most of the eight-wide SC cars take advantage of their newfound size to make things a bit more interesting, #76896 doesn&rsquo;t really have anything above and beyond an imagined six-wide version. As well as having lots of stickers, which is not unusual for a subject matter from the motorsport world, a lot of them &ndash; about half &ndash; are applied to curved pieces, which are notoriously difficult to apply stickers to. The Nissan logo across the windscreen is definitely the worst offender here; mercifully, the large bonnet piece is printed. <b>5/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The figures: </b>one driver, in a fairly uninspiring red-and-white race suit adorned with Nissan and Nismo logos, with a hairpiece to swap out for the helmet and a wrench. There&rsquo;s only so much you can say about these figures &ndash; this one is just fine. <b>6/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Play value: </b>the usual it&rsquo;s-more-fun-with-other-cars-to-race disclaimer goes here &ndash; that goes without saying. What did stick out to me with this set, however, was the lack of accessories that previously accompanied the smaller versions of cars. These were very hit-and-miss in the past, and I have complained about some in the past (any set with cones in it, consider yourself guilty). But regardless of the quality, they did all add another dimension to the play value of the set, regardless of their staying power. This feels sorely lacking here; you can drive the car around a bit, and&hellip; fix it with the wrench, I guess? In most cases the accessories were made up with no more than a dozen parts, and their absence is conspicuous. <b>6/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Model value: </b>the real-life vehicle depicted here is actually a rather unusual variant of the GT-R Nismo, which is used in various GT championships around the world. This one, however &ndash; as alluded to on the box art &ndash; currently holds the record for the fastest drift, at a shade over 300km/h (!). The niche choice of variant is to be commended, although to be honest, the efforts to represent it do fall a bit short. The big issue is the wheels &ndash; they look comically small, and make the whole vehicle look clunky as a result. The rear of the car is the most visually appealing, although the tail light arrangement looks closer to the Skyline GT-Rs of the late 1990s than the modern record-holder. The front is also mostly well-done, but as with the wheels, the headlights seem too small for the size of the vehicle. <b>5/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Overall verdict: </b>despite an interesting choice of vehicle and some reasonable building techniques, I find it hard to recommend the GT-R Nismo. If you squint, it does a decent job of getting the subject matter across; however the undersized wheels and headlights &ndash; both prominent features of cars &ndash; let the look down. I found myself wondering if the design of the car would have been any different at the old six-wide scale, and frankly I don&rsquo;t think much would change at all. Its saving grace is its uniqueness: as well as bring the first drift car, this is, unbelievably, the first Japanese car to get a Speed Champions set, despite the theme having run for nearly six years. So if you are a fan of Japanese cars or a SC completionist, pick this set up (it is currently on clearance in some places); otherwise, there is not much to miss. <b>5/10</b></p>
