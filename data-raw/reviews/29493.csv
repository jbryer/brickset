"Itellyounothing","2020-02-07T13:01:12.62Z","I am old - Nostalgia value infinity","<p>When I was small, dinosaurs roamed the Earth, but could never catch this car. Audi Quattros&nbsp;ripped&nbsp;up the rally / motor sport world.</p>

<p>It was epic. I love the squared off body so accurately represented. I love the white and yellow colour scheme. It&#39;s all brilliant.</p>

<p>The build was a little fiddly in places but required no special skills. I am just a little sausage fingered and the detail achieved was high.</p>

<p>The parts are overwhelmingly and unavoidably&nbsp;small. You could not get this much detail any other way. The new 8 stud wide choice is controversial, but the results ahve been awesome.</p>

<p>Playability - Much as I love the&nbsp;4 wide and 6 wide little cars, this looks like lego vehicles are growing like real cars. The Austin 7 of the 30s used to be fit for a family. Now a family car is over 50%&nbsp;wider and twice as long. I can see future lego cars fitting a full family soon. This has implications for lego roads and buildings, you can almost see why they moved from base plates..... Wannabe city builders be ware.</p>

<p>Value for money, Price to part ratio is looking good, but a lot of the parts are small.Overall though, for the size of the finished article, I consider it good value.....</p>

<p>Standard single punch-through box with 5&rdquo; x 7.75&rdquo; &ndash; Nothing too exciting here but it&rsquo;s got a nice, though pixelated (hey, we can assume the picture is from the 80&rsquo;s, right?) image of the actual car with considerably more decals than the LEGO set. A relief for some, an otherwise welcome challenge for me.</p>

<p><b>Minifigures:</b></p>

<p>The single minifig driver has a front and back chest print and multiple faces with both a helmet and hair with a handy hubcap-changing wrench.</p>

<p><b>Parts:</b></p>

<p>A good blend of plates and bricks with quite a bit of finish pieces comprise this car set. While necessary, the amount of finish pieces (slopes in particular) is a little excessive and there are a few instances when a single part could have substituted for two or more, of course they have a part count to hit, I&rsquo;m sure.</p>

<p>This set also has quite a few extra pieces, namely basic 1x1 plates. The extra set of 10 spoke hubcaps is nice too.</p>

<p><b>Decals:</b></p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t overly excited for this set in general since I don&rsquo;t particularly care for the car it&rsquo;s modelled after; however, I was incredibly excited for the number of decals it appeared to have. After dumping the box and bags out, I noticed the hood and a wing printed and no decal sheet to be found resulting in a mini heart attack &ndash; I LOVE my decals! I double-checked the box and the instructions and, luckily, they were stuck to the back of the instructions by static.</p>

<p>This set has a sweet sheet of 24 deals making the build a little more fun for me!</p>

<p><b>Build:</b></p>

<p>I enjoy that each of these Speed Champions sets have had unique builds based on the car &ndash; the frames aren&rsquo;t all cookie cutter, which makes for a more enjoyable build. Pretty straight-forward for a 250 piece set, the &rsquo;85 Audi is a quick, fun build, though I think the majority of the cockpit could have been done prior to the surroundings to make some smaller parts a bit easier to fit in accurately. This is just nit-picky on my part because of my bigger fingers and OCD with part alignment.</p>

<p><b>Overall:</b></p>

<p>I like to gauge the value of a set based on the variety of parts and time it takes to build. At roughly $20, it&rsquo;s a good value when the time for decal placement is considered and quite realistic compared to the source material! This was a build and break down set for me though.</p>

"Watsonite","2020-05-01T17:50:03.9Z","It stick(er)s to the road","<p>My choice of buying Lego has always been eclectic. Some themes I follow rigorously but most are more of a &#39;nice model&#39;, &#39;nice minifig(s)&#39; or nice parts-decision.</p>

<p>The Audi Sport Quattro is one of the latter. Not many Speed Champions-sets in my collection but this one simply...looked...good!</p>

<p>The car has lovely dimensions and I prefer the 6 wide over the 4 wide ones.<br />
A nice colour scheme and an interesting enough build. Once completed, the car is instantly recognizable as the rally classic it is meant to depict.</p>

<p>There are two negative issues about&nbsp;the model, one minor and one major.<br />
The minor negative point is about the seating of the minifig. The steering wheel and the minifig don&#39;t align which is akward and could have been avoided. It also makes for an uneasy fit of the minifig if his arms aren&#39;t in the proper position.</p>

<p>The major issue : does one really need to ask? Stickers, stickers, stickers, stickers,... Tremendously annoying. I know it is a long and standing issue with many fans out there... but I am honestly willing to pay more if they would just get us printed pieces. If even Junior-sets, aimed at the sticker-loving demographic, can get printed bricks, please make it a staple to just drop the stickers and print bricks.</p>

"Sobel","2020-07-02T21:34:02.3Z","My first Speed Champion, and what a Champion it is!!","<p>With all the new Submarine Explorer sets from the City theme just having been released, I for sure am hungry for some new LEGO. Unfortunately, those have no good discounts yet, so I&#39;ll have to wait a little longer. In the meantime, I found a great deal here on this site and got me this Set and the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76895-1/Ferrari-F8-Tributo"">76895 </a>for only 13&euro; each. And I guess, now I found myself a huge fan of the Speed Champions...</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>This set held several new parts for me. For example, the large 6-knobs-wide car baseplate. I only knew the 4-knobs one. Also, the small transparent&nbsp;part that holds the exhaust was new to me. The switchable rims or hubcaps are a nice idea, and there are also some nicely printed pieces in this set. What absolutely shocked me was the amount of stickers, 24 overall!! Thinking about it, I was OK with it, since real-life Rally&nbsp;cars are always&nbsp;plastered with stickers and ads.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>One driver is included. He has a helmet, hair, which can be switched with the helmet and a wrench for quick repairs. He wears a nicely printed Audi racing team suit.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A simple build from bottom to top. The very detailed instruction booklet leaves no room for doubts and so the whole thing can be easily built in half an hour without a hurry. There are lots of very small parts, so I strongly recommend building it on a clean table or in a flat box. Applying all the many stickers can be a little annoying, especially since some of them have to placed extremely carefully to fit to each other (the Quattro logo for example).</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Of course, this set is all about design and resembling the original, so there are no functions for me to describe, just looks. The finished car is around 16 cm long, 7 cm wide and around 5 cm high. It turned out to be bigger than I thought, which is nice. The cockpit has room for a driver and a co-pilot and features a steering wheel, a gear shift and a handbrake.<br />
The colour scheme, supported by the many stickers, strongly resembles the pattern of the actual car, which is shown on the box, btw. Since the original is quite a bulky, square-cut vehicle, depicting it with LEGO is pretty manageable and the LEGO designers did an awesome job. As a small extra, two sets of auxiliary head lamps can be attached to the left and right of the Audi logo in the front. The only thing this set is missing are some small rearview mirrors.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>OK, I have to admit, as someone who has worked for VW/Audi for some time, I&#39;m surely a little biased on this one. But nonetheless, this is a very cool and realistic looking set, which comes very close to depicting the actual Rally car. Being stumped by the amount of&nbsp;stickers at first, I realised they are needed for authenticity. The missing rearview mirrors are a slight minus point, but they are so small on the actual car, it would have been very difficult to implement them in a set this size. Another thing that was a little disturbing is&nbsp;that the steering wheel is not centred on the driver, but a little to his right. Also, due to the limited space, the driver can only reach it with his right hand, the left hand has to be lowered to fit with the large windscreen.&nbsp;<br />
But these small negative points absolutely&nbsp;can&#39;t change the fact, that this is a really well-designed set which can be a good fun for children (especially, when combined with some street baseplates) and at the same time a great exhibit in an AFOLs collection!</p>

"jettamkv","2020-04-28T16:59:15.673Z","Audi Quattro","<p>Overall building experience was nice, and the finished model looks good. Very detailed with the meshed air vents, along the optional rally headlamps. There were a decent amount of stickers, but the hood and two side parts were prints. The only complaint I have is that the driver has to have his left arm down, or else the windshield will not fit on. Very nice set. Loving the 8-wide speed champions!</p>
