The sponsor- and logo-heavy nature of motorsport means that any depictions of competitive vehicles are likely to need more stickers than usual to look anywhere near accurate; #76898 is no different, and contains no less than 46 (FORTY-SIX) stickers, spread across two (!) sticker sheets. With 565 pieces, this means that on average you&rsquo;ll be applying a sticker roughly every 12 pieces. This can be quite draining, so it&rsquo;s something of a relief that the rest of the build has a few points of interest. The 8-wide format to which the titular vehicles adhere to allows for some clever techniques, the highlight being the construction of the Jaguar I-Pace&rsquo;s front grille. The smart black and medium azure colour scheme of the two Jags make this set an interesting parts pack as well, with plenty of SNOT bricks, brackets, wedges and curved slopes in both colours. So a decent build, marred by a ridiculous amount of stickers. <b>5/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The figures: </b>two drivers are included to pilot each of the two vehicles, each adorned in race suits reflecting the series in which they race in. The number 20 on the I-Type 3 Formula E car suggests that its driver would be New Zealander Mitch Evans, who delivered the team&rsquo;s first victory in Rome in 2019. The figure does bear a likeness to the Kiwi with the helmet on, but Evans does not have orange hair; since he isn&rsquo;t specifically named, it would feel unfair to call this an inaccuracy. The identity of the I-Pace driver is somewhat more ambiguous, and could represent any of C&eacute;lia Martin, Katherine Legge or Alice Powell, all of whom raced in the series when this set was first released. Regardless of who it may or may not represent, it is great to see female representation in the LEGO motorsport sphere, with precious little in the real world. Both figures look terrific and complement each other (and their vehicles) very nicely. <b>9/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Play value: </b>this set brings the fun of toy cars down to its essence: two cars, two drivers and a start/finish line. Staging races between the two is enjoyable, and the wrench included to change the wheel covers can just about be justified as a pit stop play mechanism. Both cars are sturdy and can withstand racing incidents with ease, so there is plenty of fun to be had there. The only other built-in play feature of note is the sequential start-light sequence fitted to the start/finish line gantry, that works by pulling a technic axle out and letting gravity do the rest. It&rsquo;s a simple mechanic, but wonderfully effective. A third figure with some pit equipment or a flag would have added a whole new dimension to the playset, though.<b> 7/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Model value: </b>both vehicles are fairly unique within the Speed Champions theme. As well as being the only fully electric models the line has so far offered, this is only the second set to feature an SUV, and one of a handful to feature a single-seater race car, albeit the first with the new halo head protection device. The I-Type 3 &lsquo;batmobile&rsquo; FE car is a great representation of its source material, and an excellent model in its own right. The front of the I-Pace SUV is also terrific, and evokes its real-world counterpart brilliantly; it&rsquo;s a shame that the rest of the vehicle looks rather off from any other angle. The whole thing seems to have been stretched, and while SUVs are by nature hefty cars, the I-Pace is at the smaller end of the scale here. Both vehicles, however, suffer from what is in my opinion the biggest drawback of the 8-wide scale: they are <i>enormous</i>. When stood next to a minifigure the scale looks way off. The Formula E car is taller than its driver, when in reality they are little more than a metre tall; similarly, the I-Pace is closer in scale to a bona-fide offroader like a Land Rover than the real thing, which should come up to about shoulder height. Compromises are, of course, necessary when working with the awkwardly-sized minifigure, and this is not an issue that is unique to this set; nevertheless, it is disappointing. <b>5/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Overall verdict: </b>ultimately, your feelings on this set will depend largely on what you make of the 8-wide format. It undoubtedly allows for some great detailing, and this set features some really good build techniques to take advantage of that. The problem stems from the scaling of the vehicles relative to the minifigure, let alone relative to other Speed Champions sets, that makes the two vehicles look rather awkward from some angles. A single-seater race car and an SUV were always going to be a challenge to pull off in this medium and at this scale, and I must applaud the designers for their ambition; ultimately, however, they are far from perfect. An attractive pair of minifigures, loads of medium azure and some simple yet effective playability are relegated to being saving graces for this set.<b> 6/10</b></p>

"p0dracer","2021-03-19T18:59:17.563Z","Bigger than expected","<p>It&#39;s my first 8 wide Speed Champion set and I must say it&#39;s bigger than I expected. The I pace car is solidly built and has a nice big chunky size, somehow I got a feeling of holding a die cast car model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The formula E car has a great futuristic design. I will be using it as part of my Tron world vehicle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The stickers are necessary to make the cars work. I didn&#39;t apply them as I will create MOCs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nice selection of medium azure pieces. It&#39;s a great parts pack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build experience was fun. Many unique techniques and good attention to detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;m very happy with this set and recommend it.&nbsp;</p>
