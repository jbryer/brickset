<p>I mainly wanted the set for the Hurac&aacute;n, as it&#39;s such a neat car, and I was anxious to build it.&nbsp; I have a fair amount of the Speed Champions sets from the past 3-4 years and am intrigued how they all are somehow constructed the same, yet very differently!&nbsp; This is no exception.&nbsp; Especially since these cars are now being built 8 wide this year, compared to 6 wide in past years.</p>

<p>As expected, a bountiful amount of stickers comes with this set, to apply on both cars.&nbsp; That&#39;s par for the course with Speed Champions sets.&nbsp; I built the&nbsp;Hurac&aacute;n first and it was enjoyable to watch come together, with the slightly angled front end, to the gold highlights and fancy middle back fin.&nbsp; What surprised me most, was how the 2 doors were constructed, by pinning into the center console to create a slight downward angle.&nbsp; One would think that the designer had created a purposeful scissor door open/close - but that doesn&#39;t actually happen, as the roof and back windows prevent that from being possible, as they are built over top of that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Hurac&aacute;n looks fantastic when finished.&nbsp; 2 gripes, one I just mentioned was the doors.&nbsp; The other comes from the space the build of the doors takes up.&nbsp; There is little to NO interior in this car.&nbsp; You can barely fit a helmeted minifigure in the car.&nbsp; Put some hair on them - no chance to put the lid on it, there&#39;s simply not enough head clearance.&nbsp; :(</p>

<p>The Urus was a good built in itself.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know much about this vehicle, but the color is great, I love the lime green and the construction was again fun to do.&nbsp; I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of interior space available in this vehicle, which was the opposite of the similar Jaguar&nbsp;speed champions model I had recently built.&nbsp; The new rims for this car were very different and neat, but they do stick out quite a bit and in the end, kind of makes it a bit awkward as a whole.&nbsp; It doesn&#39;t actually bother me that much, but I could see that being an issue for others.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>The starting/stop gantry is a fun addition to the set too.&nbsp; Simple enough to build and I like the sliding feature for the lights.&nbsp; It makes it easy for my daughter to enjoy!</p>

<p>Overall, I like this set and both cars, but OUCH on the price.&nbsp; Even after a discount, I still feel like I&#39;m being fleeced for $$, especially after getting the dual Porsche set, which features 2 similar cars and a slightly fewer piece count, for nearly half the price!&nbsp; A definite recommendation if you can accept what you pay for.</p>
