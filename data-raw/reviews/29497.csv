<p>Another Policeman is the gift with the 17th Issue of the Lego City Comic, available between 31st July and 27th August 2019.&nbsp; This time we are introduced to the&nbsp;action hero and film buff,&nbsp;Jack McLane.&nbsp; In addition to Mr McLane we also get a nice little police car and the standard handcuffs, although no-one for them to be used on.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The foil pack is the perfect size for this set and holds the parts well.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Jack appears in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-minifig-cty0748"">three</a> sets, but only one standard City set (<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60143-1/Auto-Transport-Heist"">60143</a>).&nbsp; He has a rather serious expression on his face so I can only assume that he is hot on the trail of a Lego City criminal.&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope&nbsp;for the crook attached to Issue 1&#39;s sake&nbsp;it&#39;s not him, as there have been five police Minifigures attached to comics&nbsp;against only one criminal.&nbsp; Although we all know that crime is a major problem in Lego City based on the&nbsp;size&nbsp;of the&nbsp;Police Force, so it could be anyone.</p>

<p>His torso appears in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6172536"">15</a> sets, so it is quite common and would be easy to get should you want to.&nbsp; I alway think it would be nice to include the hair for a Minifigure as well as a hat, but the set loses nothing with it&#39;s omission.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>This build took me back to one of my favourite sets from years ago, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6539-1/Victory-Cup-Racers"">Victory Cup Racers</a>, which I still have the box for and spent many hours driving around my Lego city when I was younger loading them into my brothers <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/4030-1/Cargo-Carrier"">Cargo Ship</a>, as they headed to the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/4563-1/Load-N-Haul-Railroad"">Train</a>&nbsp;the other side of the river.&nbsp; It is based on the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/design-2441"">Chassis 4x7</a> and makes a great small car.&nbsp; It might be a bit small for&nbsp;recent sets, but does the job well.&nbsp; You also get a printed <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6132740/plate-w-bow-2x2x2-3-no-7"">2x2 sloped element</a> which adds good detail as without it the set would be too plain.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>Certainly one of the better Police sets from the comics, only narrowly beaten by <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/951701-1/Policeman-and-crook"">Issue 1&#39;s offering</a> as it comes with a Policeman and a Crook.&nbsp; I would rather get two Minifigures for the play value than have a mini-build that is limited by itself, despite how much I like the car.&nbsp; At &pound;4.25 it&#39;s good value for a comic and 31 pieces.</p>

<p>Next month we head to the stars as we get an astronaut and robot, on sale 28th August 2019.</p>
