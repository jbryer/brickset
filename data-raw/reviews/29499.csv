The inside of the juice bar is roomy and it comes with two great minifigures and alternate heads. Unfortunately, it has no app function except for the minifig scan. All in all it is one of the best hidden side sets.</p>

"GriphynHunter","2020-07-01T15:11:35.923Z","Not a Good Promo","<h3><b><font data-blogger-escaped-style=""font-size: large;"">Main Build</font></b></h3>

<p><font data-blogger-escaped-style=""font-size: large;""><font data-blogger-escaped-style=""font-size: small;"">The juice bar comprises most the pieces included in this promotional kit. I love the transcolor pieces used to represent the juice machines and drinks. The Juice Bar is a pretty hefty and structurally solid build. The orange and sand green colors play well together to give the Juice Bar a visually distinctive scheme. The awning is made with 2x1 curved slopes pieces in a very attractive pink and green colors. </font></font></p>

<p><font data-blogger-escaped-style=""font-size: large;""><font data-blogger-escaped-style=""font-size: small;"">Stickers are used throughout the juice bar. Prominently featured are the ones on the juice blenders and for the &quot;Slush Ice&quot; sign at the top. There are also the &quot;Monster&quot; stickers used on the back of the bar and under the canopy. There&#39;s enough room in the bar to house the barista Rocky.</font></font></p>

<p class=""separator"" data-blogger-escaped-style=""clear: both; text-align: left;"" style=""text-align:left""><span style=""clear:both""><font data-blogger-escaped-style=""font-size: large;""><font data-blogger-escaped-style=""font-size: small;"">The trademark monster transformation of this line is accomplished by simply flipping up the beautifully designed awning. The awning becomes the monster&#39;s eyes and furrowed brows, while we find out that Rocky has been standing under a large set of chompers! The top row of teeth are made of more awning-type pieces and the bottom row are actual an actual tooth piece. All of the teeth pieces and the Bar&#39;s eyes are made of a spring green color. They all look like they should be glow-in-the-dark but these pieces do not have that capability.&nbsp; </font></font></span></p>

<h3><b><font data-blogger-escaped-style=""font-size: large;"">Mini-fig(s)</font></b></h3>

<p><font data-blogger-escaped-style=""font-size: small;"">Included are two mini-figs: Rocky as the Juice Bar&#39;s barista and Parker as our Ghost Hunter extraordinaire. </font></p>

<p><font data-blogger-escaped-style=""font-size: small;"">Rocky&#39;s fine as generic coffee shop barista. Interesting choice to feature a hot cup of coffee/tea for a juice bar though. Rocky also has a second head + hair piece to use for when the Bar gets possessed.</font></p>

<p>Parker is the more interesting figure in this GWP. She has a beanie/pigtail head piece that features a lovely shade lilac-purple for the actual hair. Her head has two face prints, one of her smiling and another that&#39;s more inquisitive. Her all denim outfitted features a lot of fine details on both her legs and torso. Her legs have printing for ripping and wear in the denim and detailing for her pockets (pockets!).</p>

<p>The torso has a denim jacket with decorative patches slapped in a pleasing-haphazard fashion that very believably for an edgy-type teen to have created. Parker&#39;s black undershirt is untucked and this is shown on her hip piece.More printings show she is wearing a couple necklaces, one of which carriers a charm of her initial.</p>

<h3><b><font data-blogger-escaped-style=""font-size: large;"">Conclusions</font></b></h3>

<p>I mean I can&#39;t really give final conclusions here, can I? If you&#39;re picking this up on the secondary market its definitely not worth it. If you got it during Lego&#39;s GWP promo period than it&#39;s worth is really more tied to if your main purchase was something you actually wanted. (Mine was not, sad for me...)</p>

<p><font data-blogger-escaped-style=""font-size: large;""><font data-blogger-escaped-style=""font-size: small;"">A huge mark against this promo is the fact that is does not work the Hidden Side App! That&#39;s a major let down since that&#39;s a key feature of this line. I understand this is just a GWP but this would have been a great gateway to the line. I visited a Target during Hidden Side&#39;s launch and whipped out my phone to show my girlfriend how the line works. She was suitably intrigued and the demo was more understandable than any verbal or written explanation I could have provided. This GWP was a perfect opportunity to get this line&#39;s idea across to anyone who received it. </font></font></p>

<p><font data-blogger-escaped-style=""font-size: large;""><font data-blogger-escaped-style=""font-size: small;"">Based on some other movements I&#39;ve seen it looks like TLG will continue to push into the design space of video game X Lego. Hopefully future GWP from lines such as Hidden Side will include the core component of those lines. </font></font></p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-11-04T15:26:34.783Z","An Enjoyable Gift with Purchase from the past.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #40336 Newbury Juice Bar:</b> Welcome to Newbury, where Terrifying Troubles and Mystifying Mysteries cause untold nightmares for all citizens when the ghosts rise from their graves. This free gift with purchase was given away from LEGO Shop @ Home when Hidden Side was launched this Fall and it is fairly popular with most folks.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I had a blast building this small model and love the overall nature of this Theme. It&rsquo;s a nice evolution of the Toy&rsquo;s-To-Life idea with physical sets tied into an App. If they were to somehow find ways to do more with this idea in other Themes I feel it would be fairly interesting to see what they might do. For now, let&rsquo;s discuss the set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Hidden Side Theme has a unique and interesting new packaging design, featuring digital artwork on the &lsquo;front&rsquo; of the box and images of the completed set in the back. This has become somewhat controversial at retail due to the nature of the consumer being slightly confused by these sets package designs.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Or so I&rsquo;ve heard. The manual included with this set is a smaller manual with the steps to build fairly straightforward and easy to follow along with. A sticker sheet was also included for extra detailing of the set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Being a smaller set there aren&rsquo;t as many interesting parts to be found here, but there are some nice elements. You&rsquo;ve got your lime-green Mixel teeth parts, a few creepy looking printed eye elements and some nice large corner elements. (Those quarter round parts LEGO uses for balconies a lot and to add curves to walls and the like.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Parker: This version of Parker uses all of the same parts as the larger and more expensive School Bus set. Which is a great reason for having gotten this set, that being said, most of her parts are the same as the Shrimp Boat set I previously reviewed, the only exception is her torso which is printed with a blue jean jacket with the black shirt underneath and that is it, the head, head piece, legs and accessory are all the same.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Rocky: As with Parker, Rocky as a character is a Minifigure which uses a lot of pre-existing parts. The legs, torso, hair piece and head are not new, nothing about him is new. In fact I think his head print was used on the Skydiver&hellip; or, well it&rsquo;s hard to say, as I can&rsquo;t recall if that was dual-sided, but I know I&rsquo;ve seen the expressions on his head somewhere before. He&rsquo;s got a serious calm look on one side and an open mouth screaming face on the other.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">When Rocky becomes possessed however he gains a funky green ectoplasmic head, a wild lime green hair style and the urge to devour brains. I mean seriously, the dude looks like a zombie with his mouth open in that wild shrieking expression. Definitely an interesting addition to an otherwise bland Minifigure.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a pretty solid looking model and the build shows. It&rsquo;s a great looking kiosk build. You don&rsquo;t make those that often in LEGO form and while this model incorporates a transformation element, it also features a relatively solid design and I could see fans of such designs building alternate versions without the creepy possessed elements.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Stickers are used in certain elements for detailing, such as the juice dispensing machines. The most enjoyable aspect of this build for me was the colour choices, the subdued dark colours mixed with the lighter oranges stand out to me a lot. But again I get ahead of myself, let&rsquo;s discuss that in the completed model section.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As a standalone model this is pretty bare bones, it&rsquo;s the type of model you&rsquo;d want to see added in a larger display. That being said, for what it is, this is a pretty solid model. It&rsquo;s a little juice bar with machines for smoothies and you can place Rocky inside without any issue. This model has a transformation aspect, the top can pop open to reveal a frightening face with open mouth and lime green teeth. What more can I say? It&rsquo;s a great little model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This was a nice giveaway set to promote the Hidden Side Theme, it was not however a nice giveaway set to promote the Hidden Side Game, this set has no functionality with the App and so most fans and early adopters were kind of bummed out about that. I say, who cares if it isn&rsquo;t in the App? It&rsquo;s a great little model, it features a simple and fun transformation gimmick and was free! Well free if you spent so much on the new Hidden Side Theme when it came out. It&rsquo;s nothing to complain about.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Would I recommend this set? Yes. I do believe I would, the model is the real selling point here, not the functionality with the App, because everybody can use a Haunted Juice Bar in their life, especially Scooby and Shaggy. Recommended.</p>

"digi_raptor","2021-03-09T15:38:24.23Z","Possessed juice bar","<p>This is a nice little set with two nice minifigs and a transforming feature (like most Hidden Side sets). It is a small set and was quite easy to build. It has two juice machines, a place for Rocky, the&nbsp;worker and some glasses of juice spread out throughout the build. The two minifigures included are Rocky and Parker, Parker is a common figure and comes in 3 sets, however Rocky is exclusive to this set so is nice to get. The monster transformation is simple, but it works and is quite effective. This set uses mostly stickers for detail but has two printed stud tiles for the eyes of the monster side.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall nice set and would recommend picking it up, wouldn&#39;t pay above RRP for this set though.</p>
