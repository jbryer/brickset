"knuclear200x","2009-05-20T21:01:26.217Z","Face Melted by Awesomeness","A lot of the sets I used to own didn't have too many interactive features. Sure I had a lot of cars and that one set with the secret decoding translucent pieces, but this one topped them all. 

The pieces were cool, containing one small brown treasure chest and those delicious looking gold coins...mmm...uh...i mean shiny gold coins...yes...a chain, and a cool bendy palm tree. A lot of nice figures too, we had Johnny Thunder himself, the evil tophat guy who remained nameless to me til today, a scorpion and loose-armed skeleton wearing a pharaoh's headgear. The skeleton wasn't as fun back in the day (in my opinion) because of its loose, unposeable arms. But they changed that years later.

But the main feature of this set was the treasure tomb under the Anubis Statue. I've seen a lot of sets that featured things like catapults that didn't always impress, but this one was just awesome. The chain connects one end of the statue and a spear lever on the other. By simply pulling the lever back, it will open the smoothly placed compartment and reveal the sacred treasure...under the zombie skeleton and scorpion. The two won't pop out at you or anything, but you can imagine it which pretty much is part of the fun. What's even better is that you can play with the compartment over and over and it wont break off til after a long while.

And after you're done with it and have many extra pieces at your disposal, you can take it apart and turn the tomb into a secret base or some kind of protective shelter with laser guns etc. But its up to you.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"SaintElsewhere","2010-02-14T17:17:35.03Z","Beware the pharaoh's curse!","   This set is quite lovely. The tomb in the middle of the desert is well-executed, with the jackal statue that doubles as a treasure chest; the spear lever that opens the tomb; and the printed tile warning trespassers of the danger that lurks within all serving as prime examples of the detail Lego put into their sets back in the days when ""Only the best is good enough"" actually meant something.
   The minifigures are great to look at, especially Slyboots, who is dressed rather improperly for the Egyptian desert, with a black dinner jacket and top hat. Johnny Thunder, on the other hand, is a bit more sensible, with an open-collared khaki shirt, a wide-brimmed fedora to protect him from the sun, and a handkerchief in case of dust storms. Then the skeleton has...a headdress. Yay.

Pros:
*hieroglyphs add detail
*scorpion
*jackal-statue/treasure chest is a nice touch
*printed map tile
*palm tree is a nice touch

"Chaz777","2009-04-07T11:00:22.263Z","Brilliant set, up there with the best of them","This has always been one of my favourite sets, because, as I said in my review of 6672, you get so much.
I was about four or five when the first adventurers sets came out, and when I first saw them in the catalogue I wanted them badly, but since my birthday was coming up, mum said I could only have one small set at the time, then the two 'big ones' (Sphinx secret suprise and Temple of Anubis) for my birthday. This was the small set I chose.
I certainly wasn't disappointed. This set lasted me for about two months of solid playing and building, which was easy because of the bricks you get. You really do get everything you need for any Egyptian adventuring situation you can think of. The featured model, for a start, which is a nicely designed sarcophagus- type thing, with the statue of Anubis on top concealing the hidden gold coins, and the long-dead priest laying in the main compartment. Which, by the way, opens when you pull the spear lever next to it.
As well as that, you also get the main protagonist of the theme, Johnny Thunder, and the main antagonist, 'Snake boots' (or Lizard boots, as I called him for some reason). And they aren't short of equipment, either, having a weapon each, a revolver and a rifle, and a map which they have to fight over. You also get a palm tree thrown in for good measure, which is on it's own little 4x4 plate piece so you can position it anywhere. 
I also want to talk about the skeleton, which I still like more than the 'What the hell is he wearing' mummy from the larger sets. His headpiece is fairly rare nowadays, and he has a scorpion to protect him, which I thought was pretty cool.
And to top it all off, the alternate models are pretty good, too, with the two hieroglyphic panels and Egyptian warning sign piece making any temple, tower or ruin you like possible.
Oh, and I should mention that the hieroglyphic panels on either side of the sarcophagus are stickers, which would be a con in any other review, but I've never really minded them that much, so in this review they're a pro because they look cool.
So all in all, this is a fine set that is well worth hunting down, either as a counterpart to some of the other Egyptian sets, the start of a new collection, or just because it's a great little set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"alosx","2010-04-25T17:41:56.153Z","Part of something bigger.","<p>I bought this set about 10 years ago and i was astonished. Then. By minifigs. </p>
<p>Building experience and playability is nothing much if one does not have some other sets, prefferably of Johnny Thunder. It is a cleaver opening box with standard skeleton in it (pharaoh headpiece is not so standard, but it is nothing to yearn for). Playability is low, because how long one can play around a box? Experience says: not for long. It is a great set with combination with other Johnny Thunder sets, not so good stand alone set. It would give a lot for this set to have some transportation in it: a plane, a car or even a simple motorcycle would do.

I was only 8 at the time but this was a set that remained a favourite for a very long time. I loved the chain opening the tomb up gimmick, and it was a thing I incorperated into my own creations many times afterwards. </p>

<p>I had not long studied ancient Egypt at school and was very interested in the subject so was pleased that this came out.</p>

<p>I think that although the set is small, it does have quite a bit of playability. It has&nbsp;3 mini figures, A good guy, a baddie, and a mummy to attack them both, and it has weapons for them all (providing the mummy gets the spear) and a scorpion. I did not have many other sets of this theme as a kid, as I was the sort of kid who would buy from any theme and not be limited to just one, though I did pick up the scorpion tracker car as well which complimented this set nicely. </p>

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-24T06:03:33.697Z","LEGO Adventurers (Desert) - Oasis Ambush Review","This is a set which includes a tape with an awsome story for the LEGO Adventurers. This set is really easy to build and it has a sticker on each side of the sarcophagus. It's a very sturdy set and the sarcophagus does open if you pull the spear which is attached by a chain. You can put in the skeleton very nice. On the top of the sarcaphagus is a black dog statue with a black treasure chest where you can hide some gold.

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T23:37:38.59Z","This is an Oasis?","<p>Set #5938 Oasis Ambush: I think the title of this set is misleading, true it does include a palm tree, but when I hear Oasis I think cool watery shaded place in the middle of arid wastelands, not a dangerous miniature tomb with the skeleton of a dead Egyptian King waiting to spring to life and murder you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set from the Adventurers theme is one of the small cheap sets released back in the day - it includes three mini-figures, a black scorpion, gold pieces and a treasure chest to put them in. It also includes one palm tree and a scary looking tomb, like I said not an Oasis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnny Thunder is the same as we've all seen by now, a LEGO interpretation of an Indiana Jones archetype. He carries a pistol with him in this set and a treasure map marking the location of the tomb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sam Sinister... That is his name, right? Well he's obviously working with Johnny for the betterment of mankind. <strong>Not.</strong> This villain of the Adventurers theme is in it for only one thing, the gold, and he carries a rifle just to proove that he can take care of himself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Skeleton is the older designed version with the floppy limbs, so even though he can hold a weapon or other accessory he can't wield it very well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building the Oasis part of this Oasis Ambush is fun and relatively short, but it offers up some nice little touches. (In spite of the stickers used for detailing, which still hold up quite well thirteen years later.) The aforementioned stickers give Egyptian Hyrogliphics designs for each side of the miniature tomb, there is a printed&nbsp;plate with instructions on how to open the tomb.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is accomplished by pulling on the spear which pulls the chain which flips open the top of the tomb allowing the skeleton to leap out (with a little help from the one playing with the set.) and scare off the intruders. The clever design of the dog-like statue incorporating the treasure chest as the body is really neat, and evokes a feeling of Egyptian style masonry/carvings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scorpion just sits in the open visible to all in the instructions, but if you wanted you could easily squeeze him into the treasure chest to protect the gold. After thirteen years my palm tree has only one good frond left, the others are broken or breaking so I'll have to order some replacements one of these days from LEGO Shop At Home. Still if you want some older style bendy palm trees this is a cheap way to get one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all I rate this a five, because it's fun, it accomplishes what it sets out to do and it invokes the spirit of the Egyptian Mummy movies from Universal, or even Abbot &amp; Costello Meet the Mummy. The Instructions also showcase alternative models that can be built with the pieces in the set, but you'll have to figure out how to dupliate the photographed models yourself, which is part of the fun of LEGO.

"tadlos61","2016-09-24T05:24:14.8Z","Perfect little set!!","<p>This was my first set from the Adventurers&#39; theme,&nbsp;and I love it! &nbsp;As a child I spent hours pitting Johnny Thunder and Slyboots against each other. &nbsp;To this day it remains built;&nbsp;it is perfect for its size and price. &nbsp;This set encompasses all of the main ideas of the Adventurers&#39; theme. &nbsp;It has a trap, treasure, nice palm tree, clever design and your good guy, bad guy, and mummy.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I love the box art and instructions. &nbsp;I remember as a child, it really gave the vibe of this little temple being hidden in the middle of the desert.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Nice parts! The palm tree is wonderful, along with the treasure chest/coins, scorpion, trap door,&nbsp;and a couple of printed pieces (treasure map and hieroglyphs&nbsp;on the 1x4 plate) The hieroglyphs&nbsp;on the side of the tomb are stickers, but they are the decal type, and are still firmly in place 18 years later :)</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Perfect selection! &nbsp;You have your hero, Johnny Thunder, with his map and a revolver, and then the sinister Slyboots with his rifle, and finally the mummy hidden in the tomb, he is my personal favorite. &nbsp;The mummy looks great with the yellow headdress</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>A unique build, I had fun building the trap and hidden treasure chest!</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Very nice little set, looks great! The trap is so fun! &nbsp;You pull the spear and the trap door opens revealing the mummy! &nbsp;The hidden treasure on top is awesome too! It perfectly blends into the Anubis/canine&nbsp;statue!</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in the Adventurers&#39; theme, or just anyone wanting to get a taste of what that wonderful theme was all about :)</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>

I chose it, because it had many interesting pieces: coins, scorpion, chain, map, rifle&nbsp;and skeleton with nemes. And I loved that it had 2 secrets: black chest, hidden in plain sight&nbsp;as a very appropriate&nbsp;jackal (Upwawet) statue, and mechanism to open the lid of the tomb. It was so simple, but worked&nbsp;really&nbsp;well. I don&#39;t know, though, why builders thought it&#39;s a necessary thing for a tomb to have.</p>

<p>Also, it has some ideas for alternative&nbsp;assembling. The shrine with chained skeleton has&nbsp;very creepy implications. And the picture of the skeleton in a&nbsp;top hat is self-explanatory.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a great little playset that has everything for an adventure. I think it holds up till this day.</p>
