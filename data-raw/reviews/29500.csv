<p>Issue 16 of the Lego City Comic comes with Tommy Tube.&nbsp; It also comes with a very small section of underwater landscape based on a 3x3 corner plate&nbsp;with a crab.&nbsp; It can hardly be called the underwater world that was promised in the previous comic but adds a little extra to the set.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>As ever the Minifigure comes in a sealed foil bag taped to the front of the comic, which this time is too big for the parts you get inside.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Tommy is unique to this comic, although his torso has been around for a couple of years and appears in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6182771"">five other sets</a>.&nbsp; It always appears with black legs too.&nbsp; However, this is the only appearance with a blue helmet and this head element.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>The <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6185108"">green camera element</a> is a nice inclusion.&nbsp; I was surprised to see it in 10 other sets, but it has only recently been added to the City line&nbsp;for 2019 which is why I wouldn&#39;t have encountered it before.&nbsp; The crab element too is quite common.</p>

<p>The build is straightforward.&nbsp; This is the first comic that does not contain instructions for the build.&nbsp; It can be made very easily just by looking at the image on the front of the foil pack, but does seem strange not to have the instructions, even if it is just a handful of parts.&nbsp; Anyone new to Lego might be put off by this despite the ease of the build.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>This is a nice little set that compliments the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60221-1/Diving-Yacht"">Diving Yacht</a> nicely and therefore worth picking up.&nbsp; Especially as the comic was only priced &pound;3.99 in the UK which is very reasonable.&nbsp; A slightly larger underwater world with maybe a crate or fish may have been welcome and increased my overall score to 4.</p>

<p>I look forward to the next set, which is another Police Minifigure, that is attached to Issue 17.</p>
