"LegoHobbitFan","2019-09-26T21:06:56.55Z","A Great Minifigure","<p>The dog sitter is one of the minifigures available in the 19th series of Collectable Minifigures, retailing for $3.99. Is it worth it? Read on for my opinion...</p>

<p>Legs: The legs are dual-molded, with white on the bottom and blue on the top. There is also some nice printing on both sections.</p>

<p>Torso: The torso is printed to look like overalls over a white shirt with black stripes.This printing continues onto the back. There are also dual-molded arms to represent white short-sleeves.</p>

<p>Head:The head is double sided, one side is smiling, the other has a look of disgust, a rare expression that could prove very useful. The purpose of it will become apparent in a moment.</p>

<p>Hat/Hair: She&nbsp;comes with a dual-molded headpiece to represent a blue baseball cap with a ponytail coming out the back. There is a white paw print printed onto the hat.</p>

<p>Dogs: The real draw of this minifigure though is the fact that it comes with 2 dogs! The first&nbsp;is a white French bulldog. While this mold has appeared before, the printing is new. The second is an entirely new piece, and represents a dachshund! It comes in brown, and its body is 3 studs long, plus the head which is another stud. It also comes with a stud on it&#39;s back.</p>

<p>Other accessories: As if the dogs weren&#39;t enough, it comes with 2 more accessories! First is a shovel, which appears for the first time in bright green! The official images make it look normal green, although it is actually bright green. You may be wondering why she would have a shovel though. Well, remember how I said I would explain the disgusted face soon too? Well, The other accessory is a piece of poop! It is an entirely new piece, and the set even came with an extra of it! This is currently it&#39;s only appearance, and it only comes in brown. It is very similar to the cupcake piece that was released a few years ago, but is slightly different.</p>

<p>Playability: There is not a whole lot to do with this fig, although the 2 dogs do offer a lot of possibilities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Display:The figure is really detailed, so looks pretty good on display. This would be a pretty useful figure to add to a city scene or such as well.</p>

<p>One of the problems with this figure is that you have to feel it out as it comes in a blind bag. Luckily, this one is pretty easy to feel as it comes with a lot of easy to identify accessories.</p>

<p>Verdict: This is a great set to buy for multiple reasons. The value of the dogs makes this fairly expensive on the secondary market, so it could make a good investment. It is very detailed so looks great on display. The 2 dogs offer quite a bit of play value too. So, overall, I have no hesitation in reccomending this set as it offers great value for just $4.</p>

<p>I hope you find this review helpful!</p>

"CantHelpMyself","2019-11-27T22:24:42.807Z","Dog Sitter Minifigure 71025-9","<p>The Lego minifigures in series 19 are all of a high standard with design and detail.</p>

<p>Number 9 in the series of 16 is the Dog Sitter 71025-6. The female figure is in blue overalls with a white shirt underneath. Her brown hair is tied back in a pony tail. Figure has a blue baseball style cap with a white paw print on the front. The detail in the face, hair and cap is fantastic.</p>

<p>The Dog Sitter comes carrying a shovel with two dogs in toe.&nbsp;A white bulldog and a brown sausage dog. Both dogs are really well done.</p>

<p>In stepping it up to the next level of realism each dog has left a little <em>present</em> for the Dog Sitter to pick up with her shovel.</p>

<p>There are a total of 10 parts to create this Minifigure.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-11-26T17:18:57.593Z","Yip, Yip Doggies! Yay!","<p><b>Set #71025 Dog Sitter:</b>&nbsp;This brilliant offering from Series 19 includes not one, but two new animal elements. A wonderful looking printed hat with hair combo with a pay symbol on the front and an impressively detailed outfit on her torso and legs.</p>

<p>Carrying a green shovel and dressed in a pair of work coveralls over a striped shirt and matching blue shorts, this Dog Sitter is prepared to help her canine pals... I know one of them is a Dachshund, which is a new animal of course, but I&#39;m a bit uncertain as the breed of the white canine she comes with. I want to say pug or pit bull, but I could be off on both of those fronts.</p>

<p>The ever helpful Dog Sitter includes a smiling face and a disgusted face as she picks up the pups leavings. Yes, as an added accessory she includes two 1x1 elements representing doggie droppings. I&#39;m not sure how she&#39;s going to carry them off though to dispose of them, she did not come with a plastic baggie.</p>

<p>The two new animal parts alone are worth getting many, many Dog Sitters for your collection. She is Highly Recommended and is one of the tops for Series 19 in my Top 5 List of best offerings from this wave. Highly Recommended.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The dog sitter is a great figure and probably owns the title of most disgusting accessory .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure uses the modern ponytail hat combo with paw print printing , the head has a happy expression and a disgusted expression , the torso has appropriate printing that leads into the legs that are dual moulded and have side printing along with the dual moulded arms .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>Her Accessories include a green shovel , nice recolour of the bulldog , an exclusive mould for a dachshund and...........get ready for this............some poop..........yes Lego made a poop live that they use for chocolate in the Harry potter astronomy tower to me it will always be poop nothing more nothing less . Her stand is the standard CMF stand that only fits every one of there is a dog in each side and she is holding the shovel and poop..........gross .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this a figure that really goes over the top with the amount of Accessories and what they are cough cough #LEGOpoopisathing and that is why I recommend it .</p>
