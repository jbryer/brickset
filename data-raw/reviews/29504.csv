<p>The legs are black at the bottom which are made&nbsp;to look like feet, and the hands, being black as well, compliment the look nicely. The torso is pretty simple; it is all orange with&nbsp;black hands,&nbsp;and&nbsp;white furry chest printing. The head is double printed; one face shows a smile, and the other shows the girl licking her lips ready for a treat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This minifigure also wears an orange&nbsp;and white tail, and also a very nice brand new&nbsp;head piece. The chicken is in a new color&nbsp;which looks more realistic. The sack is nice as well.</p>

<p>Some&nbsp;of&nbsp;the parts may have simple printing, but this minifigure was a really fun one to obtain!</p>

Fox Girl got into the Hen House!","<p><b>Set #71025 Fox Costume Girl:</b>&nbsp;This mischievous scoundrel of a thief has a sack in one hand, a chicken in the other and is proudly defying conventional wisdom as she lips her lips in anticipation of a good meal. Alternatively she has a confident smirk on her other expression.</p>

<p>With a new head piece for the Fox helmet, a familiar Chima era tail piece and a simple torso with fur printing on the front and some dual-moulded legs to round off the look, this Minifigure is a fun one to show up.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;m pleased to own two of this Minifigure, she&#39;s definitely a great addition for the Costume Menagerie set. Strongly Recommended.</p>
