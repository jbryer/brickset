<p>As mentioned in the title , I ain&#39;t a gamer dude. I still love this figure though! &nbsp;I&#39;m pretty sure I would appreciate this figure even more if I was one , but I still find it perfect just as it is. Definitely in my top 3 of this series. Anyway , I really appreciate and love the detailing on this figure , especially on the arms (like the classic space logo present throughout the whole shirt of the figure is some nice fan service). I also really like the awesome reference to the series 16 Cyborg (as the Cyborg minifigure&nbsp;is one of the few ones I have from series 16). I wish the name of the game accessory had a more creative name than &quot;SPACE GAME&quot;but I don&#39;t really care, that Cyborg and the silver shining on it &nbsp;more than makes it up for me. The new controller piece is AWESOME, the molding and the buttons and joystick printing on it was great&nbsp;, a really well-made&nbsp;and useful piece&nbsp;that was missing in the world of Lego. The recolor of the hair/headset piece in green from the star wars line is pretty cool , I don&#39;t really have anything else to say about it. The two face prints are the happy/content and the mad/determined face , both expressions are amazing , the mad/determined face is my favorite expression. I also really like the legs&nbsp;with the amazing hip printing.</p>

<p>Overall, one of the best of the series in my opinion , definitely in my top 3&nbsp;of series 19. nearly everything about it is perfect. It&#39;s&nbsp;a fantastic figure that adds a really finely detailed minifigure to your collection , with useful parts and expressive faces. Perfect figure , &nbsp;easily a very recommendable figure for fans of Lego.</p>

<p>Video game champ is a nice figure from a fairly decent series .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>He has a hair headset combo with bright green and black , his head is double sided with a happy and annoyed expression , his torso has a symbol on his torso with subsequent side arm printing and his legs are plain with only a bit of printing .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>His Accessories include a 2&times;3 printed gaming poster and an almost exclusive console piece as it also comes in the 2020 avengers tower . His stand is just the plain old CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this figure is based on something that I have no interest in (gaming) but I love this figure and would recommend it to any Lego fan .</p>

He&#39;s wearing a printed jacket with loads of symbols for his favourite game, with a shirt underneath showing a blocky-head with headphones, definitely wearing the merch. His pants have a key ring attached to the belt with an emblem that makes me think of LEGO Space Invaders.</p>

<p>He has a printed game controller piece which is unique and brand new, a printed 1x2x3 tile with a game case visible on the front showing off the Play-Box generic Space Game case using the Cyborg from an earlier series as the main playable character, and he&#39;s got a unique to him hair piece in green with attached headset for live-streaming. He has happy and angry expressions and a silly looking goatee. Love that the little M symbol on his jacket could be an indirect nod to M-Tron. Or Mario, considering he also has the classic Space symbol and an upside down Triforce as part of his detailing. Perhaps a subtle nod to the partnership with Nintendo?</p>

<p>Overall this is a very impressive first character straight out of the gate and he&#39;s loaded with references and nods to gaming culture. His parts are awesome and can be used and re-used in many fun ways. I&#39;m sure some folks already wanted more than twenty of those printed tiles to add into their very own MOC game store. I&#39;d definitely recommend this one. Strongly Recommended.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>The Video Game Champ has some nice pieces. There&#39;s a new hair-and-headset sculpt, perhaps limited by the color, and the face is generic enough to be used for any number of characters. The torso is definitely for certain personalities but it&#39;s casual and fun, and the legs are the same. The video game controller is probably going to see a lot more use in the future, but it&#39;s a good new piece to have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The minifigure</h2>

<p>This is LEGO&#39;s second video game player in the CMFs, but this one is more clearly a Let&#39;s Player, streamer, or esports competitor, going by his headset and his dyed hair (which most closely recalls the green hair worn for a time by JackSepticEye). It&#39;s a pretty accurate caricature of full-time gaming entertainers and doesn&#39;t seem off-base or clich&eacute;. His hair is really nicely sculpted in waves with the headset included and is the brighter green color. His face shows a young man with a goattee, with one expression confident and the other focused and determined. His outfit is really nice, being a denim jacket covered in Classic Space logos over a grey T-shirt and some blue jeans with a Space Invader on a chain.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Video Game Champ comes with a controller, which is the fairly standard M-shape a lot of companies&#39; controllers use, and it has the requisite D-pad, twin joysticks, and four buttons. The piece has a single antistud on the bottom to be held in hand, and can be gripped from the edges, though minifigure articulation means he can&#39;t hold it like a person would. His other accessory is what appears to be a game box, though as a 2x4 tile, it&#39;s ridiculously oversized and would make more sense as a poster. Regardless, the generic-tiled &quot;Space Game&quot; is for the &quot;Play-Box&quot; system, mixing PlayStation and Xbox, and features the Series 16 Cyborg on the cover, suggesting she&#39;s the protagonist of the game. I&#39;d play it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Final thoughts</h2>

<p>This figure is a nice different take on video game culture and doesn&#39;t feel cringeworthy or inaccurate to me at all. He&#39;s just a nice representation of a real phenomenon who has some welcome flair and good pieces.&nbsp;</p>
