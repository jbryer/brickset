<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see Lego make this character in their cfm sets.&nbsp; And they did a phenomenal job with this little guy.&nbsp; The detailing on his body &amp; legs is superb.&nbsp; The face has two sides; a mischievous grinning face &amp; a serious face ready for combat.&nbsp; The specialized cape is unique, &amp; his staff is well done.&nbsp; Sadly, I would have liked a couple different lengths of the red pole, since his staff can extend in the legends.</p>

<p>For anyone who likes oddball characters, mythology, or nerdy things, this guy is perfect.&nbsp; Totally worth hunting down!</p>

And I got him just in time for Chinese New Year!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Monkey King is an absolutely gorgeous minifigure! Dual-molded headpiece, arms, and legs. The overall color scheme of red, dark red, and gold works beautifully. The split cape is really nice. He features intricate printing on his legs and torso, even on his back! He has two faces: an in-charcter mischievous face and a battle ready face. They even included his headband!</p>

<p>His staff is rather simple but does the job wonderfully. Intentional or not, the set also includes one bar and one hilt as extras, so you could even extend his staff like in the stories! (Or just use them to give him a lightsaber haha.)</p>

<p>I&#39;m gushing a bit over this, but I&#39;m genuinely happy to see something from my culture and childhood realized so well in Lego form. Lego put a lot of effort into this minifigure and it shows. An absolute must have for fans of the character, and a wonderful Lego minifigure in general.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-11-25T19:05:51.89Z","Monkie Kid Origins!","<p><b>Set #71025 Monkey King:</b>&nbsp;Before the Chinese theme Monkie Kid we have Monkey King, one of China&#39;s most iconic legends and a basis behind Goku of Dragon Ball fame. Our Minifigure friend here uses a host of printed detailing on his torso and legs for traditional style armour. He features a tail, a new head piece with sculpted simian inspired ears and a hole up top to fit a new style of plume in red. He comes with two of these plumes for those who like alternate uses for parts.</p>

<p>His face features a mischievous looking grin with visible teeth and a more serious expression for when its time to stop making jokes and start taking down his enemies. His weapon uses two pearl gold lightsaber handles and a red bar. He also features a new shoulder armour and a cloth cape in two parts which gives him that regal look.</p>

<p>Overall the Monkey King is extremely interesting. Most of the parts are re-used in the Monkie Kid theme, but new elements were created for his weapon. I&#39;d recommend him to fans as his print is unique here. Recommended.</p>

<p>The legs are very nicely printed, and are dual molded, they are fantastic, though probably not useful anywhere else. Next is the tail element, and it is actually printed with a thin band of gold across the front! Well done! The torso is fantastic as well, indicating gold battle armor with a green orb in the centre. Next is the cape, this is a fascinating piece, split down the centre so the tail can poke through. It is connected with a single hole, like Jafar from the Disney Series 2 CM. The red armor piece returns from Ninjago, where it is used for the Stone Warriors. The face is very intricate, displaying grumpy/grinning expressions. Very monkey-like! The hair price is nice, I really appreciate the ears, especially because we usually only see ears on licensed figures with prominently large ears, such as Yoda or Dobby. The feather returns from Overwatch, and I think it looks amazing. The staff is made from two gold Lightsaber hilts with a red bar. He comes on a normal CM stand, and you get an extra feather, hilt and bar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want to get a taste of Monkie Kid without denting your wallet, or bought a&nbsp;Monkie&nbsp;Kid set and want to complete your cast of characters, look no further as this&nbsp;minifigures is amazing and includes a lot of interesting peices.&nbsp;</p>
