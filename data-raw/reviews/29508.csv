<p>&nbsp;The legs are my favorite part of the figure,&nbsp;the bubbles printing is absolutely hilarious and it always gives me a little chuckle every time I see it. There&#39;s a towel piece which uses the old papery style material for it which I didn&#39;t mind here, I like the duckling design printed on there, it looks pretty cute.&nbsp;The torso is a reused one from sets you would see in the beach sub-theme&nbsp;of Lego city&nbsp;(it doesn&#39;t bother me too much ,&nbsp;because it&#39;s still fitting for the figure).The facial expressions are really awesome, especially with the embarrassed/sincere face and the open smile expression was nice as well.&nbsp;The shower cap makes its return here in white once again and&nbsp;I liked getting it here. His accessories are a blue comb which was nice to get and the recolor of the duckling piece now in green which I love, and it looks so adorable!</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s not one of the top 3 of series 19, but it comes pretty close. This figure definitely has its strong parts like the legs, the facial expressions and the accessories.&nbsp;It&#39;s&nbsp;a pretty unique idea for a CMF. The Shower Guy is totally worth picking up and it gets my recommendation&nbsp;, just not as strong as the&nbsp;Gamer or&nbsp;Biker&nbsp;from the same series, but still worth&nbsp;checking out!</p>

"Brickking6077","2020-05-12T00:10:15.677Z","Was enough time showered onto this guy?","<p>Hot, steaming water, the foggy glass, and soft, dry towel all contribute to the inviting experience that is called taking a shower. Despite this, I never expected Lego to make an eccentric figure for this&nbsp;comforting occasion. I&#39;ve&nbsp;had to think again.</p>

<p>I love that the shower cap is&nbsp;a reused&nbsp;part and I believe no better element could have been made. The head in similar fashion has awesome graphics that accurately capture that moment when the piping water begins to hit your back and also that moment when you forget to lock the water closet door to utter embarrassment.</p>

<p>His chest is rather plain and pales in comparison to the older, ab enhanced&nbsp;piece. Although it does not attract me quite as much as the head, the printing underneath the surprisingly detailed towel is beautifully colorful. I don&#39;t know if it was the best choice or is completely appropriate, but I&#39;ll accept it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What really lets me down is the accessories. I believe a hygiene item other than the traditional hair brush would be&nbsp;preferable. The rubber duck is in a new color, but should have stuck to the original yellow as it would have matched the well designed towel splendidly.</p>

<p>The Shower Guy certainly has some letdowns. I have also purchased less worthy minifigures before. However, the fact that this is the most humorous minifigure of my collection might just be enough to save it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-11-25T15:38:25.583Z","Rubber Ducky, you're the one...","<p><b>Set #71025 Shower Guy:</b>&nbsp;This wonderfully hygienic Minifigure features plain printing on a yellow torso showing off a belly button and chest muscles. He has a cloth skirt element around his legs to represent a towel, which is printed with little duckies. These cloth skirts never look as neat or tidy as the official photos, I wonder how they get them to bend/crease so neatly.</p>

<p>Carrying a green rubber duck and a light teal brush and wearing the Surgeon&#39;s head piece as a shower cap this character is loaded for fun times in the bath or shower (despite his name), he also has a double-sided face. One side is happy and smiling, while the other shows an embarrassed flush, perhaps at being found with his duck, or perhaps if his towel falls off as there is some printing on his legs with soapy bubbles around his waist.</p>

<p>Overall this is a pretty impressive Minifigure with some excellent parts. His little green ducky has a little red beak, and we don&#39;t get too many unclothed Minifigures for displays. On top of that the Surgeon Head piece is always useful for Hospital MOCs.&nbsp;Highly Recommended.</p>
