"PerryThePlatypus","2020-01-22T15:38:30.73Z","According to my calculations, this is a pretty darn good figure","<p>A nerdy looking programmer with a robo dog? Works very well!</p>

<p>I gotta say though, the robo dog is a bit weird in appearance&nbsp;, but it&#39;s pretty creative in its build, I&#39;ll give it that. It has a pretty clever part usage with the overwatch guns as the base piece, and I also really appreciate the 1 by 1 printed brick as the face. The other accessory is a reprint of the laptop piece in white, which is nice to get after always mostly&nbsp;getting it in black.The figure is also phenomenal! It&#39;s a fresh idea for a CMF figure and it&#39;s really nicely detailed. The legs (which are&nbsp;dual-molded)&nbsp;are AWESOME! The sweater&nbsp;tied around the hips legs was&nbsp;done really well&nbsp;here&nbsp;and it can definitely be used&nbsp;for different&nbsp;situations&nbsp;and custom figures. The torso has a nice detail of binary (which says&nbsp;Lego in binary) and dual-molded arms, I also appreciate a small detail of shine on the necklace above the shirt. The new face prints are nothing mind blowing, just a new happy and determined/confident face prints which is totally fine. The hair is a fairly new mold, but the coloring isn&#39;t new, it has come in the City people pack-fun fair, but it&#39;s still a nice inclusion as it&#39;s a way cheaper alternative to get the hair piece.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t the BEST figure of the series, but it&#39;s ONE OF the best. Again, this is a fresh idea for a CMF&nbsp;and it&#39;s way more creative in the trope and execution , compared to the Mummy&nbsp;Queen and the Fire&nbsp;woman from the same series. It&#39;s a pretty good figure to get multiples of (though getting multiples is not really my thing&nbsp;, I think this figure is the one from the series that&#39;s&nbsp;the best for getting multiples of).&nbsp;The accessories are really neat and it&#39;s overall a really fantastic figure, go get it, it&#39;s totally worth it!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-11-25T19:48:57.92Z","STEM Professions for the Win!","<p><b>Set #71025 Programmer:</b>&nbsp;This clever and smart woman from the STEM field works in robotics and has built herself a robot dog. Dressed in a black t-shirt with 0 and 1 stamped all over it, a classic nerd joke I believe, with a red jacket or sweater tied around her waist giving LEGO an excuse to make a brand-new type of dual moulded leg where the moulding cuts off at an angle in the back and some side printing on her legs to add detailing for her jacket.</p>

<p>I think that&#39;s a tad confusing, but basically it means we have a new type of leg here. She also has a new style of hair with a frizzy black pattern on it... actually when I look at it I think Shuri from the MCU, I wonder if this was first used for her in the Infinity War sets. For accessories, she has a white laptop and a buildable robot dog, very clever little build here using an alien style blaster as the centre torso so a Minifigure can hold it. (Well Overwatch style blaster, but you get my point.) She also sports two expressions, an open mouth smile and the closed mouth smirk.</p>

<p>Overall I dug the look of this character. She&#39;s an awesome looking offering from CMF Series 19 and a real treat for fans of STEM professions. Her hair is also an awesome piece and I love that they included it here.</p>
