"Slobrojoe","2020-04-07T11:30:28.073Z","An old theme relived in a modern day minifig","<p>This is&nbsp;the Fright Knight, a character from the Collectable Minifigure&nbsp;(CMF)&nbsp;Series. He is 1 of 3&nbsp;minifigs&nbsp;I&nbsp;have from Series 19 and is possibly the best. If you haven&#39;t&nbsp;checked out my profile yet, I am trying to review all my sets during the Coronavirus lock&nbsp;down period. Hopefully, I&nbsp;will be adding pictures soon, just not with the CMFs. Without further ado, I shall begin.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Packaging:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The minifigure comes in the usual plastic blindbag&nbsp;but the ball shape of the helmet should make it reasonably easy to find. I don&#39;t really review the blindbag art or the pathetically small, taped-up instructions, so you might want to find a picture online.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The minifigure is comprised of&nbsp;9 pieces and you get an extra&nbsp;translucent light-blue&nbsp;flame/feather piece along with a sword (with&nbsp;a rounded tip)&nbsp;of the same colour. All&nbsp;in all, there are 11 pieces in the blindbag. All the&nbsp;parts in the set are exclusive. Out of the total 11 pieces, the torso is worth the most; it is being sold on Rebrickable for &pound;1.12, which is almost half the price of the actual blindbag.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build:&nbsp;</p>

<p>As usual, this minifigure takes about half a minute to make.</p>

<h3>The completed minifig:</h3>

<p>Starting from top to bottom, the trans-light blue feather is molded really well and can give the effect of wind. It fits into the top of the helmet by a small stem attached to the feather. The ball-shaped helmet is a dark pearl-grey colour and features a fixed grill like some Knights used to wear. The head is the first of 3 supernatural features on the minifig. It is a pale blue-white colour and has pure white eyes. There are four pointed fangs, outlined with blue lips. Next, the armoured breastplate&nbsp;is a light pearl grey and shows a few bronze patterns. Despite being the most valued part in the set, the torso print is quite simple. On the front, the Fright Knight shows off some silver chain&nbsp;mail&nbsp;which is bound together by leather buckles. The pattern of chain mail carries on to the back. The&nbsp;arms are a metallic pearl colour, whilst the hands are the same colour as the headpiece. The top of the legs have some armour carried on from the torso, which then fades away to some bronze designs. The one thing that I&nbsp;love about these legs is that the design is carried onto the hips, with&nbsp;a small leather belt. Now, we are onto the accessories. The translucent light-blue colour of the rounded sword suggests something supernatural at work here. His shield is adorned with the red and black symbol of a bat with open wings. However, the bat insignia is surrounded by&nbsp;some medium-deep red rust. Finally, the edge of the shield is a dark maroon with circles, possibly representing spikes.</p>

<h3>The Fright Knights:</h3>

<p>Now, it&#39;s time for a history lesson! The insignia on the Fright&nbsp;Knight&#39;s shield actually belongs to a sort of cult called the Fright Knights. Apparently, they were a faction of Knights (duh) that were not ruled y a king, but instead, Basil the Bat Lord. The Fright Knights were a subtheme of&nbsp;Castle and lasted from 1997 to 1998. So, basically, if you&#39;re pretty young like me, you probably will have&nbsp;never have heard of this subtheme before. The LEGO line contained 17 sets, most under 100 pieces, which&nbsp;relied more on character than quantity. the largest set, 6097: Night Lord&#39;s Castle, had 601 pieces and appears to still be quite popular today.</p>

<h3>Price:</h3>

<p>I bought the blindbag for &pound;2.99 or US$3.99 and, for all exclusive parts and 2 spare, this was one of the best purchases I have possibly ever made.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion:</h3>

<p>I&#39;m sorry this review has taken so long, especially for a CMF, so thank you for bearing with me. It has taken so long because, honestly, there is so much to say about this minifig&nbsp;and I truly think that he is one of the best CMFs ever. Series 19 is still available to buy in selected shops, and some are in clearance. It might just be worth buying a whole box of unopened S19 blindbags in the clearance just to get this guy. I hope i have persuaded you to buy this minifigure either second-hand or used. Thanks again!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-11-24T20:55:26.1Z","Terror Revived! The Fright Knights return.","<p><b>Set #71025 Fright Knight:</b>&nbsp;This spooky spectral knight of the land sports a familiar logo on his small triangle shield, the image of a bat. A more modern interpretation of course, but it is to be expected.</p>

<p>Basil the Bat Lord lead the Fright Knights in the 1990s and this menacing spectral character uses the old logo re-imagined for the new millennium. He includes a sword and plume in Chima Ice Blue and printed armour as well as more printing on his chest and torso to add greaves and other details. His face is ghostly pale with a menacing open-mouthed expression showing off vampire like fangs. Overall this Knight is a terrifying menace and a very nice addition from Series 19. I&#39;d recommend getting multiples if possible, they go great in any Halloween or Monster inspired build display. Highly Recommended.</p>

"8BrickMario","2022-09-22T23:23:16.383Z","Interesting parts, confusing figure ","<p>This figure has baffled me for a bit. I picked it up because it&#39;s a ghost and a throwback, but ultimately I didn&#39;t find either of these aspects well-done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The pieces of this figure are pretty good if you want dark and aged armor. You also get a slot-grille helmet which can be nice to have, and a pretty gender-neutral&nbsp;ghost head in aqua, as well as a pair of flame/plume pieces in translucent light blue, and a sword in the same color plus a shield.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This is ostensibly supposed to be a soldier from the vintage Fright Knights theme who&#39;s been wandering the earth as a ghost. But they don&#39;t really feel like they came from that theme. Very few elements seem accurate. Really, only the bat logo on the shield and the rounded sword feel like sufficient retro references, but the rest is inauthentic. For one, none of the Fright Knights whatsoever used that helmet shape. The pointed helmet with the nose guard is the only helmet from that theme that LEGO still makes, but a remake of the dragon-crest helm would have been ideal. The head is cool but doesn&#39;t seem right for the character. If this character is male, then facial hair would have made them look more like the older Fright Knights which all had some.&nbsp;If the character is female, the head just feels too modern and emotive. A more smug face with more simplicity would have suited the reference more. The armor and colors don&#39;t work for me either. Some Fright Knights wore grey, but there was also stark black with appealing color contrast and this figure doesn&#39;t have that. The armor also feels anachronistic given that breastplates weren&#39;t made then, and the torso design doesn&#39;t resemble the older Knights. The ghostly plume and sword are fun pieces, but I think they could have been left solid for a simpler, more plausible image of a ghost inside normal aged armor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall thoughts</h3>

<p>Maybe I&#39;m taking this too seriously and they weren&#39;t literally trying to make this character a remnant from&nbsp;Fright Knights the theme. But it sure seems like that&#39;s their intent and I don&#39;t think the figure succeeds if it is. It doesn&#39;t feel like a good retro remake. If the character had a less specific&nbsp;name then the shield would just be a cute reference without the whole character being posed as from the older theme. They&#39;re okay taken on their own merits, though.</p>
