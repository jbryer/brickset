<p>I&#39;m honestly kind of still surprised with the inclusion of an entire bike piece in a collectable minifigure&nbsp;packet , I&#39;m very glad that Lego didn&#39;t omit the bike. If they did , this figure wouldn&#39;t be as good as it is.</p>

<p>Luckily, the bike isn&#39;t the only good thing about this figure. The main thing you are paying for IS the minifigure, and I&#39;m glad to declare that the figure is also fantastic. I really appreciate the side leg detailing of the figure , things like the white stripes and the continuation of the knee pads are pretty cool. I also like the bandage printing on the arm , it&#39;s some great detailing. The 2 face prints are also nice.&nbsp;My personal preference is the determined expression with the glasses , which I absolutely love, the other expression&nbsp;is also good , but not as good as the expression with the glasses in my opinion. The new hair/helmet mold , while not the most useful mold out there , it&#39;s still a very welcome new piece.</p>

<p>This is definitely one of the more underrated&nbsp;minifigure of series 19. This figure doesn&#39;t beat the Dog Walker of the same series in my opinion, but this is one of the best figures of this series , as well as best values (with the bike pieces). This figure absolutely gets my recommendation , for the good value of the figure and the overall appearance.</p>

<p>Mountain biker is a fabulous minifigure who happens to come with the joint biggest CMF piece along with beach batmans dolphin in the Batman movie series two .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>Her helmet hair combo is very nice with dual moulded detail , she has a double sided face print with glasses and a smile , her torso is printed on the coral colour and she has dual moulded arms with one of them have an injury , her legs are also dual moulded and she has subsequent side leg printing .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>Her accessory is a very nice bike which is a recolour of the one from the lego city outdoor adventures now in blue , it has two wheels in a dark yellow and two plain tyres . Her stand is just the plain old CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a good figure with a great accessory and I would recommend it to any Lego fan .</p>

The first CMF to include a large bike sculpt part as an accessory, we&#39;ve had some skateboarders and surfing Minifigures with those accessories, but this is the first time we&#39;ve seen an entire bike frame included with a CMF.</p>

<p>This particular bike frame is brand new in blue. The minifigure rides on it fairly nicely, leaning forward. Despite what the picture shows she can&#39;t slide all the way down, her legs are hindered by two bars on the side of the chassis. She uses a long flowing brunette hair and helmet combo and features some very nice printing with dual-moulded legs. Her top is very sporty and her arm is sporting a bandaid where she recently suffered a minor scrape.</p>

<p>One side has goggles and the other features a confident sassy smirking expression daring you to challenge her on her turf. Overall a strong offering from Series 19 and one I would highly recommend. Highly Recommended.</p>
