Possibly, though I highly doubt it. This wonderful figure includes dual-moulded legs some excellent printed detailing on her torso and legs with dirty wraps around her waist while everything else is more pristine and still white.</p>

<p>She features a scarab jewel on her torso and a green Egyptian style headdress. Her head features two faces, a regular LEGO Minifigure head in yellow which looks similar to the Egyptian Queen, as I noted above, and a more decayed shrunken face for her mummy form. Perhaps the ancient spirits of evil transform her decaying flesh into Mumm-Ro! The Ever-Beautiful!</p>

<p>She carries a golden scorpion accessory, either a jewel or a living creature, you decide. Overall this is a fairly nice looking Minifigure with some excellent detailing and fits in quite nicely with LEGO Scooby-Doo, Monster Fighters or your other Halloween inspired collections. Recommended.</p>

"8BrickMario","2022-09-19T05:43:20.053Z","Perfect for Egypt or horror!","<p>It&#39;s a bit surprising it took until 2019 to get a female mummy figure--and even more surprising that she wasn&#39;t in the Series 14 Minifigures. The mummy was the only classic monster type represented in Studios, the unthemed CMFS,&nbsp;Monster Fighters, and Scooby-Doo to not be reprised in the Monsters series of minifigures. Nonetheless, she was eventually made-- and I&#39;m very pleased.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The pieces of this minifigure are highly specialized save for the headdress, which appears in teal with a band of gold and red and teal patterning on it. It&#39;s still distinctly Egyptian, but could be used on a living Egyptian character as well as a dead one.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The minifigure</h3>

<p>The Mummy Queen is a really nicely-detailed character who recalls previous Egyptian-garbed&nbsp;monster mummies like the one from Studios and Amset-Ra from Pharaoh&#39;s Quest. Her colours are bright and attractive, but she has some spots of dirt on her and her skirt is a dusty colour to connote her age. Her bandages are bright white and pretty tidy, and her torso features a collar but no robes while her arms feature colourful bands. Her head is really nice. On one side (pictured) is a yellow death mask with a simplified face painted on it to replicate her living appearance, while the other side is uncovered, showing her goofy rotted Sand Blue face underneath, with vacant Spring Green eyes and rotten teeth. It&#39;s a really good mummy face, and I appreciate the unique corpse color. We&#39;ve seen green and greys before, but not blue. The last mummy to use a double-sided head with a death mask was Amset-Ra, whose death mask implied he was the Series 2 Pharaoh in life. The Mummy Queen, however, does not seem to be the undead form of the Series 5 Egyptian Queen. Part of me finds her to feel a bit unadorned and humble for a queen&#39;s mummy, but I still like her design. Her accessory is unpictured, but fairly typical-- the LEGO scorpion, cast in gold this time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall thoughts</h3>

<p>While it took a long time, I think it was worth the wait for a female mummy. Even with no new parts, she&#39;s an attractive and useful design that can flip from historical to horror-themed with the turn of her head. If you want her and can get her, do.</p>
