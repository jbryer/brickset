<p>Is it bland? Yes.<br />
Is it boring? Yes.<br />
Is it worthy? No.</p>

<p>I mean, seriously, a fireman in a CMF-series?</p>

<p>There are almost no redeeming factors to this figure: the prints are boring, nothing special. The face is boring, nothing special. The helmet is kinda nice, but again, nothing special.</p>

<p>The only cool thing is the printed horn. That one is actually good looking.<br />
Is it worth 4&euro;, euhm, no...</p>

<p>This is by far the worst figure in this series, and I am almost ashamed that I bought this one...</p>

<p>In addition to the many LEGO City sets containing firefighters CMF series 19 gave us yet another one, nothing special right?&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>I personally think this figure is special though, for the first time ever we got print for the reflective stripes on the arms and the sides of the legs! Something I wanted for a long time, and something LEGO would most likely never put into regular City sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s also nice to get a different&nbsp;torso print as the LEGO City line has been using the same three black bunker gear torsos since 2011. I also like how it differs from the others by including a reflective vest which is worn over the aforementioned bunker gear. And yes, the torso is printed on both sides.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides that, the firefighter also introduced&nbsp;a new dual moulded hair-hat combo with a nice colour combination of bright red for the helmet and cool yellow for the hair.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>She also comes with a megaphone which was originally introduced for Professor Filius Flitwick in flat silver, here it is moulded in white and is decorated with a couple of nice prints.</p>

<p>Her head is&nbsp;great too. It has two faces, one calm and one for shouting commands through her megaphone. I very much like the fact that her secondary face can also be used to convey disgust and/or indignation.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>A very common type of minifigure but a very well executed one if I do say so myself. I personally think this is a great inclusion in the series and a very useful figure that will fit in&nbsp;any city and/or fire brigade perfectly.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-11-26T15:46:32.78Z","Better for Parts than the Figure itself.","<p><b>Set #71025 Fire Fighter:</b>&nbsp;We have seen many takes on Police Officers in the Collectible Minifigures line, but I had expected they would ignore this profession here as there are quite a number of Fire Fighters in LEGO City sets. I feel that this was an excuse to make a brand-new hat/hair combo for female fire fighters.</p>

<p>The Fire Fighter is dressed in standard LEGO Fire Fighter wear complete with emergency visibility vest and some additional emergency colouring on the legs and arms. Aside from the arm printing I&#39;m fairly certain that this print is not unique to this figure, the torso details and leg prints are found commonly on LEGO City Fire Fighters.</p>

<p>She includes two expressions, neutral and open mouth shouting as she yells instructions through her megaphone accessory. This is a new sculpt I believe too, it is white and features a Fire Shield logo on either side. Her hat and hair combo includes a blonde cut with bun.</p>

<p>Overall I find her to be very impressive, but also one of the weakest offerings from the Series. While I personally wished I could have gotten a few more to help flesh out the populace of LEGO City firefighters, I would say unless you&#39;re going for a complete set of figures you may wish to skip this one. She&#39;s the weakest female character in this set too with many others being much better designed. Mildly Recommended.</p>
