I love that this minifigure is a throwback to the classic Johnny Thunder. The face is perfect, and the hat, magnifying glass, and backpack are a nice touch. I also love the new chameleon piece.&nbsp;</p>

He has the hat, a familiar looking style of jacket printed on his torso, some tough leather pants, or slacks for you UK folks, and sturdy brown boots courtesy of his dual-moulded legs. Equipped with a magnifying glass and a backpack and a facial print that bears some similarities with famous LEGO adventurer Johnny Thunder, this fellow is prepared to discover all manner of treasure.</p>

<p>In fact he includes a new chamelon piece to add to the ever-expanding collection of LEGO Animals. Done in a rich green tone with some nice colourful markings, this little guy can fit over a Minifigures hand or any 1x1 stud.</p>

<p>Overall this is a great little Minifigure from Series 19 and if you can you should aim to get multiples of him. Highly Recommended.</p>

<br />
The print quality is good for the Collectible Minifigure line. The notable accessory pieces are the backpack and the chameleon animal piece.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s a solid figure that accomplishes the concept and goes beyond with the quality of print and accessories to bring this CMF to life.</p>
