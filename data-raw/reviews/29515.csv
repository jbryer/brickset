<p>With a fun purple beehive hairdo and some really lout outlandish clothing with spotted print on her legs and a flower print top, this stylish Granny (she dresses and looks like she&#39;s in her late 50s early 60s so potentially a grandma),&nbsp;is equipped with a few leafy stems for simulated weed pulling and the aforementioned flamingo piece.</p>

<p>She&#39;s an excellent looking figure and definitely worth tracking down for the parts alone. She would also fit in quite well with the 50s diner Modular if you happen to have it. Overall I&#39;d recommend her over and over again. Recommended.</p>

Then the more I looked at the figure herself, the more I realised how special and eccentric she is, and she&#39;s the real treasure here. With her garish outfit and makeup and that great big lavender beehive, she looks like she walked straight out of a John Waters picture. They really could have made the concept of &quot;gardener&quot; so dull, but they managed to make such a unique and eccentric character and it really shows what a little bit of care and attention can do. The production work is fantastic, every tine line is crisp as can be, all the metallic printing for her makeup and the leopard spots on her pants are eye-catching, all without looking too out of place in any City environment you put her in. A really great &quot;generic&quot; figure with a great big personality.</p>
