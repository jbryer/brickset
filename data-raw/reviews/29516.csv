<p>This set contains; one pizza costume guy, one display stand, and one pizza sign.</p>

<p>The Pizza costume guy is is a unique figure. His torso is nothing special to this set. His Legs are exclusive to only this set with a Pizza apron like pattern. His head is also exclusive to this set and has a beard and stubby stash. His pizza slice costume is the same piece seen with watermelon dude only with an exclusive pizza print this time.</p>

<p>The Pizza sign is printed on a white 2x4 tile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall i think this set is really fun, and whether he is outside you city&#39;s Pizza place, or on display in your Minifigure collection, if you like pizza then this is the figure for you.</p>

I appreciate the printing on the legs and the overall colour scheme is nice. This makes good use of the watermelon mould from the LEGO movie 2 series and the face of the minifigure matches the colour of the cheese! It will be even better with an alternate face, but the face it has now is still great. Overall, I think this is a really nice and creative&nbsp;figure.&nbsp;</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-11-26T20:10:51.98Z","Wanna Buy a Slice of Pizza?","<p><b>Set #71025 Pizza Costume Guy:</b>&nbsp;Re-using a part first seen with The LEGO Movie 2 Series, this fellow is dressed up as a large slice of pizza to advertise the sale of same to potential customers. As we all know the diet of LEGO Minifigures consists mostly of bread, apples, bananas, turkeys, various pies, ice&nbsp;cream, popsicles, sausages/hot dogs and pizza.</p>

<p>Indeed the two largest food products in LEGO must involve the Pizza and the Sausage/Hot Dog. This fellow is dressed up as the most popular pizza topping, Pepperoni, he has a face with a half-smile as if to say, yeah, I know, I&#39;m dressed up in this silly costume. This face reminds me of Shaggy with his goatee, but not so much the moustache. He carries a printed tile which showcases 1$ for a slice of pizza or 1$ for a cheeseburger and fries. A nice versatile menu piece for local restaurants of LEGO City. To complete the look he&#39;s wearing checkered slacks with red, white and green diamond patterns.</p>

<p>Overall this is a pretty solid offering from Series 9 and a fun re-use of the Watermelon Slice costume seen previously. I&#39;d definitely recommend this one, may even go so far as to recommend a few of them just for the parts alone. Recommended.</p>

<p>Pizza costume guy is my personal third favourite minifigure from the alright 2019 series 19 .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure very nicely reuses the watermelon guy head attachment in a new tan colour with pizza printing , he has a joyful face print , unprinted torso , printed legs with subsequent side leg printing .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>His accessory is a 2&times;3 advertisement featuring the pizza and a burger . His stand is just the plain old CMF stand .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a very nice figure I just wish that he came with some pizza and some torso printing but I would still recommend it .</p>
