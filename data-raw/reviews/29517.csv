I&#39;m not entirely certain if this is some kind of LGTBQ representation, considering all the rainbows present, but this figure is definitely odd.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve had a fellow dressed up as a Panda of course, this uses the same exact head piece with new printed detailing. Honestly it&#39;s an ok figure, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of the chosen design here. It clashes too much for my liking, the heart tiles and printed rainbow half round tile are nice accessories though. What is he doing with his face though? One expression has this almost cooing look with a small open mouth as if he&#39;s trying to talk like a bear, match the placement of the mouth on the costume, while the other has a weird smile with raised eyebrows kind of looking really sheepish. Again just not much of a fan here.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to step on anybodies toes, especially if some people see this as some kind of mascot for LGTBQ representation in LEGO City, but this just does nothing for me. The expressions are odd, the patchwork look of the figure is not very well-thought-out and the colours are too clashy. There should have been more greens and purples to match the rainbow look they were aiming for. Half-Heartedly Recommended for Fans.</p>
