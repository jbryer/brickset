"BelgianBricker","2020-02-09T13:10:40.9Z","All hail Blacktron","<p>Probably my most wanted CMF form the latest 2019 series. This Bounty Hunter is not just a Bounty Hunter. It is a Blacktron Bounty hunter!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have always loved Blacktron and own every set from the series so I could not pass on this little guy. He is almost perfect: form the nice helmet, the shoulder pads, his gun and his nice trans-red printed &quot;wanted&quot; poster&nbsp;to the small, but obvious Blacktron logo on his chest. I love how LEGO pays homage to its past in this way. (Although some have mentioned he actually portrays a Fortnite character...)</p>

<p>The printjob&nbsp;is good. Maybe detailing could have been a little bit better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Strangely enough, his helmet, torso and legs are printed in a different way then shown on the promotional pictures. I like the way it is shown on these pictures better than the way they are actually printed. It looks more subtle, more sophisticated.&nbsp;Now I feel like there is too much silver everywhere, especially on the helmet.</p>

<p>The Bounty Hunters face sports a nice evil looking grin. There is no alternate face, but we do get a&nbsp;backprint, that kinda looks like Ninjago&#39;s Zane&#39;s.</p>

<p>All in all, I like this figure a lot. It is a nice addition to any Blacktron army!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-11-26T20:51:21.317Z","I'm looking for this Minifig, have you seen him?","<p><b>Set #71025 Galactic Bounty Hunter:</b>&nbsp;This menacing interstellar traveller hunts down Minifigures for a price, included with him is a printed transparent red book cover with the image of a Wanted Minifigure on it with a reward of 300,000,000 LEGO dollars. He includes a new shoulder armour, a nice looking helmet with some printed visor detailing and a very impressive looking torso design which kind of reminds me of the UFO aliens of Classic Space UFO Sub-Theme.</p>

<p>Underneath his helmet is a terrifying face with menacing smile and some sort of cyber-implant on the back of his head to jack into special computers probably. I find this Minifigure to be highly collectible and his parts are really nice too, love the little nod to generic minifigure with his Wanted poster and the Built or Broken comment underneath the Wanted declaration.</p>

<p>Overall I&#39;d highly recommend this character for your Classic Space shelf. Really fun, really clever. Highly Recommended.</p>

"vikings","2020-04-04T01:17:03.053Z","Galactic Bounty Hunter","<p>This was definitely the figure I wanted most from this Collectable Minifigure Series 19.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Comes in normal CMS package. The instructions are a little different from the traditional instructions for the CMS series instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You get 8 pieces with this CMS figure. You your traditional black stand. You also get a black dual blaster which is really cool. Also, the trans red Wanted poster is a really cool piece to get.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The Galactic Bounty Hunter is such a great figure. The helmet is really cool. You get a light grey printing on the helmet representing a mask is really nice. The head is a dark silver grey. The face is slightly exposed (Like robot Zane from Ninjago) It is mostly light blue with a little pink red for the eyes and around the edge of exposed face. There is also a little printing on the back of the head.&nbsp;I haven&#39;t seen this piece of armor before, but it is really cool and unique. The printing on the torso and legs is good. The yellow and silver printing as armor is nice as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Just building a minifigure.</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great figure. The accessories you get with the figure are really good and complement the figure well. My only problem is that the printing on the helmet, torso, and legs isn&#39;t the same as advertised. It isn&#39;t an orange red color but a yellow. The black armor isn&#39;t black but a silver grey. The printing on the mask is a silver dark grey color and much more noticeable than as shown. Besides that it is a great figure. The look of the figure overall is great. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"VerMonster","2020-02-09T16:24:58.247Z","Dead or alive, you're going with him.","<p>The bounty hunter is my favourite&nbsp;out of this&nbsp;CMF cycle by a fair amount.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The design is both clean and highly detailed- I know, contradiction. The detail is enough to make it distinctive from any other similiar characters in minifig form, LEGO or third party. He&#39;s not a Stormtrooper or Mandalorian, nor is he a Spartan or some kind of Ironman armour. He has bits of all of the above though, plus maybe some&nbsp;Blacktron. But there isn&#39;t so much detail that he feels cluttered the way some other armoured and helmeted figures do with their prints.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build... It&#39;s a minifig, not much you can do to make that exciting or novel. The dual blaster is a nice touch, as you can modify it with binoculars, and with a spare speargun and even stud shooters you can MOC up heavier ordinance for bigger bounties. The wanted poster is a nifty peice and I hope we see more of this mold in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability&#39;s rating stems from the design. Along with collecting, as an AFOL I also use my minifigs as props for table top RPGs. I run sci-fit settings and this gives me a nice change from the usual. That is aided by the fact that I got four of them out of the two dozen specimens&nbsp;from this CMF cycle that I bought, making this clearly a common character. LEGO has always had a very strong, almost suspiciously strong, law enforcement representation and this enforcer keeps that going.&nbsp;</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2021-11-06T09:34:01.367Z","A decent figure from the most recent non-licenced series of some quality!","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>The 2019 series 19 Bounty Hunter is an underrated figure as it has some fun design choices and reusable parts.</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The figure has the Firefly/Ant-Man/should&#39;ve been used for Wasp helmet in black with mask printing, a face print depicting a pink spotted blue alien face on a gun metal grey head, an armour piece with shoulder pads on each side, a printed torso with the &quot;Classic Space&quot; Blacktron logo printed and some decorated legs continuing the armour detailing.</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>The most interesting of the two accessories is a trans red rendition of the book cover piece depicting a holographic wanted poster which is very nice and there is a black &quot;Galaxy Squad&quot; pistol included in all of its goofy glory. The stand is the standard black CMF stand.</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This is a good figure from a pretty good series, the printing is of a good standard and the wanted poster is very cool, well worth the &pound;1.25 I spent on it, so I recommend it.</p>
