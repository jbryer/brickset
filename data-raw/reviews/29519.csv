This gentleman is dressed in a white and dark green uniform with matching shorts, unfortunately he does not include dual moulding for his legs and so has an incomplete stripe of yellow paint for his knees instead of actual yellow plastic.</p>

<p>He has a perfectly healthy looking face on one side and a smashed up bruised face on the other, Rugby must be a highly painful sport. He also includes a Rugby ball with the word Rugby printed on it and overall the printing is quite nice for his legs and torso even showing off the added protection for his stomach. (Or what I assume to be pads and not simply his abs.)</p>

<p>Overall a decent enough offering, not the greatest for people like me who don&#39;t know the sport all that well, but still a nice inclusion for the Sports Professionals collection. Recommended.</p>
