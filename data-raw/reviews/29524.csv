<p>This is a cool pencil case and the extra stuff inside is nice but....why is this a promo two years in a row this is terrible for a promotion .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>&nbsp;They should be polybags , minifigure packs or small sets not picnic blankets , art prints or pencil cases . Please stop doing these promos .</p>
