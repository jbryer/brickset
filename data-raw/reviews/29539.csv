"Somnium","2020-12-22T12:00:24.237Z","Great but far from being complete.","<p>First of all, this is my first Lego book ever, so I didn&#39;t compare with any previously released books.</p>

<p>The book is very cool, especially for those who have been collecting Lego Star Wars for decades. Each page shows the most recent version of a character, bringing previous variations, curiosities of the character, its&nbsp;look, the minifigure design, when it first appeared. Characters are in&nbsp;chronological order of appearance of the saga, taking into account the 9 episodes, Rogue One, Solo,&nbsp;Rebels and Clone Wars. Figures that I didn&#39;t even remember existed have dedicated pages in the book. Really cool.</p>

<p>However, there are some negative points. About 40% of the book&#39;s thickness is a space to accommodate the minifigure of Darth Maul. It&#39;s&nbsp;a dead volume. The encyclopedia is NOT complete. I noticed the lack of several figures like slave Leia, Jabba, those inspired in&nbsp;Battlefronts, several Jedi from the Clone Wars and other Legends, just to name a few.&nbsp;And I&#39;m not even counting that&nbsp;minifigures from 2019/2020 were not included, like Ahsoka, Clone troopers from 501st and 332nd from the last season of Clone Wars and the complete absence of The Mandalorian characters. An annoying thing is&nbsp;that many minifigure heads have double sided faces&nbsp;but the encyclopedia rarely showed the alternative expression, being limited to the &quot;main&quot; one. The back printing of the characters are rarely shown either.</p>

<p>To counterbalance, an exclusive Darth Maul figure is included, based on his brief appearance as leader of Crimson Dawn in the film Solo. The minifigure is excellent, with exclusive parts just for him&nbsp;with the spotlight for the Crimson Dawn medallion on his&nbsp;chest and cybernetic legs (with toes!). He&nbsp;comes with his&nbsp;double bladed lightsaber. This will possibly be the closest to Clone Wars Season 7 Darth Maul.</p>

<p>Despite the negative points, I did not regret buying the book. I learned a lot with the texts&nbsp;and the minifigure is excellent. For my first book, I&#39;m happy with the&nbsp;purchase. I can&#39;t deny, though, the appeal of Darth Maul minifigure; should it be a lesser popular character, I&#39;m not sure I&#39;d buy it.&nbsp;On the backcover of the book is the suggested price of $20, so it&#39;s up to you whether it&#39;s worth or not.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Presentation</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This third printing of the LEGO Star Wars CE features a new cover with a split colour choice, instead of the black of the previous books we have a half red, half blue cover with a Stormtrooper on the front and Rey on the back. Previous printings have featured more characters on the front. It&rsquo;s a very impressive looking design and a nice change up from the previous releases.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Darth Maul: Many variants exist of this character, the unique version found in this third printing of the CE is the version seen in Solo a Star Wars Story. He has extremely detailed printing for his torso and legs, the feet include little robot claws to indicate this is after he replaced his legs in Clone Wars. Come to think of it I don&rsquo;t recall that look from the film. That being said, his double-sided lightsaber is also included and he uses a very sinister looking facial expression with a scowl that definitely says he is not amused.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Overall Darth Maul looks fine, but I&rsquo;m not entirely certain how accurate he is to his film appareance.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Contents</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There are pages separated by series in the book, you have Episode I, Episode II, Episode III, Clone Wars, Solo, Rebels, Rogue One, Episode IV, Episode V, Episode VI, Episode VII, Episode VIII and Episode IX. You have 224 pages in the entire book and I believe that still isn&rsquo;t enough to cover EVERY SINGLE Minifigure version.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve read the pages, but most of the information seems to be accurate. I can&rsquo;t recall any specific examples of misprints or incorrect information, but I can be fairly certain there are more than likely some. Especially on the data facts boxes where things can be missed. And some of the information may be out of date by now. Actually I guarantee it&rsquo;ll be out of date by now. A solid third printing though.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The reason most of us buy these is for the unique Minifigures. And that is no exception for myself. I do enjoy reading these types of books, but they aren&rsquo;t definitive editions and can never be until a theme is fully retired. As such you will not find images of every single Minifigure in the Theme and the write-ups will perpetually be out of date. That being said, they are still nice for what they are and I&rsquo;d say this one is worth picking up. Recommended.</p>

"Torrent_Studios","2022-03-05T09:09:59.033Z","Third edition - is the latest the best?","<p><strong>Introduction</strong><br />
<br />
Having owned the first edition of this Star Wars Character Encyclopedia which included an exclusive Han Solo figure, I wouldn&#39;t have been too interested in this edition if it weren&#39;t for the fact that I missed out on the last edition of this book which included an exclusive prototype white Boba Fett figure (which I do regret). The exclusive Darth Maul with this book didn&#39;t really interest me either.<br />
<br />
Moreover, the cover art seems relatively bland compared to&nbsp;past editions of this book, with this new version only featuring two prominent colours -&nbsp;sand red and sand blue, with some relatively&nbsp;camouflaged greebling - and&nbsp;a large image of a Stormtrooper on the front as well as Rey on the back. On its left is the rectangular plastic shell for the exclusive Darth Maul figure.<br />
<br />
Of course,&nbsp;the&nbsp;LEGO and Star Wars logos are present in the top left corner.<br />
<br />
<strong>Minifigure</strong><br />
<br />
The aforementioned exclusive Darth Maul included with the retail edition of&nbsp;this book has printing that is beautifully&nbsp;accurate to his surprising cameo&nbsp;appearance in Solo: A Star Wars Story. Unfortunately this means that&nbsp;the minifigure has extremely limited&nbsp;uses, unless you are super interested in recreating the scene where Qi&#39;ra converses with&nbsp;Maul.<br />
<br />
Maul&#39;s head and hair pieces are reused from earlier recent Maul minifigures, while his torso is newly printed with loose-fitting black robes which show Maul&#39;s red tattoos, as well as&nbsp;Maul&#39;s golden Crimson Dawn necklace. His legs are printed with draping robes as well as excellent mechanical detail which enhances the gunmetal grey aesthetic of the mechanic legs that Maul acquired from Mother Talzin during The Clone Wars.<br />
<br />
This exclusive Maul figure comes assembled,&nbsp;and is completed with his double-bladed&nbsp;lightsaber comprised of a metallic silver hilt and trans-red blades, which is the usual combination.<br />
<br />
There is only an assembled minifigure and a lightsaber weapon to put together and then attach to the figure, so there is not much building process.<br />
<br />
I&#39;m satisfied&nbsp;that they went with Maul as the exclusive minifigure and not some unrecognised background character, however&nbsp;I can&#39;t help but think&nbsp;that Maul has had many iterations - plus this version is fairly insignificant - and the one exclusive minifigure slot might have been better utilised for another figure who has yet to appear in physical LEGO form (<strong>cough</strong> <em>Bastila&nbsp;Shan</em> <strong>cough</strong> <em>Season 4&nbsp;Kallus</em> <strong>cough</strong>)<br />
<br />
<strong>Book</strong><br />
<br />
This third and latest edition of this Character Encyclopedia has substantially more content compared to past editions, featuring&nbsp;slightly updated character pages from past editions of this book, as well as&nbsp;new characters that have joined the ever-expanding LEGO Star Wars universe&nbsp;since the last publication.<br />
<br />
An ongoing issue with these books is that about half of the thickness is devoted to the minifigure shell and the hollow space surrounding it, artificially bumping up the thickness. This is one area I like more on other LEGO activity books with minifigures, as those minifigures&nbsp;come in their own blister pack on the cover instead of inside it.<br />
<br />
Personally I find it very enjoyable to read through all the information and look&nbsp;at the images of the minifigures - it evokes a warm and fuzzy feeling because I used to do this all the time back in primary school.<br />
<br />
However, the content is objectively cringey, as no doubt many adult collectors might find. Much incorrect&nbsp;information is included as well, which is a problem that plagues many of Doring Kindersley&#39;s LEGO publications. Presumably this is because more hard-to-understand information had to be simplified for DK&#39;s target audience, which are younger children, but then there is also information, for example regarding statistics and other numbers, that are wrong for no apparent reason.<br />
<br />
Many figures have also been conspicuously&nbsp;left out, for example:<br />
<br />
- Jabba the Hutt<br />
- Commander Ahsoka Tano<br />
- 501st and 332nd Clone Troopers<br />
- Rebels characters like The Inquisitor Fifth Brother, or the three old geezers<br />
- Battlefront 2/The Mandalorian characters<br />
-&nbsp;some Jedi from The Clone Wars<br />
- Slave Leia.<br />
<br />
The latter minifigure&#39;s absence is most suspicious, it&#39;s as if Disney doesn&#39;t want anything to do with this particular character anymore, and would completely erase her from existence if they could.<br />
<br />
Characters from Star Wars: The Old Republic are also largely missing, like Satele Shan, Darth Revan and Darth Malgus, although there is a minor mention of the SWTOR Sith Troopers on the TROS Sith Trooper page.<br />
<br />
Another issue is that there&#39;s not really enough space in the book, so for about three times, they had to resort to cramming about six clones into two pages, with little detail about each. It&#39;s very disappointing to see, especially because not nearly all the clones ever produced were featured.<br />
<br />
<strong>Overall thoughts</strong></p>

<p>All that being said, I still enjoyed what I got from the book. (I&#39;m still reading it!) The exclusive Darth Maul figure would be a draw for hardcore LEGO Star Wars collectors, and I&#39;m sure many children&nbsp;would find the book fascinating as I did and would have if I were younger.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, the price of $35 AUD is rather&nbsp;expensive for what you get - although it can be argued that the book itself is of quite high quality, matching DK&#39;s usual standards - and there are undoubtedly much better sets to buy for the same&nbsp;price point&nbsp;as this Character Encyclopedia.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I would recommend this book, albeit at a discount, to any hardcore fans or collectors&nbsp;of LEGO Star Wars if you like these books, or if you don&#39;t happen to own previous versions.<br />
<br />
Thank you&nbsp;for reading, I hope you found this review helpful and informative.</p>
