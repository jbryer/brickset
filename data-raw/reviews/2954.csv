It contains a fair amount of generic and specialised bricks in unusual colours, particularly as furniture and fittings - drawers, taps (faucets) etc. I confess - I bought it for the two R2D2 legs that you get.

A good, inexpensive accessory set for girls playing with Lego, or parts freaks like me.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
