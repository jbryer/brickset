"clundsberg","2011-05-01T02:59:56.417Z","Special Edition Comments","<p>I will begin by stating how much I enjoyed the Adventurer series.&nbsp; I had all of the sets from the desert which in my opinion was the strongest of the waves.</p>
<p>Aside from the pre-Indiana Jones archeological fascination of these sets and the booby-trap infested playsets, I was drawn in mostly by the retro 30's/40's vehicle builds. Both vehicles in this set creatively make use of implementing the rifles into the vehicles' structures.</p>
<p>I loooved the bi-planes and could not get enough of the various sets:&nbsp; This particular sets has stickers showing quite considerable damage to the plane along with the horribly chosen polka-dotted patterns used to patch up said damage. Also used for the eyes and teeth of the bi-plane.&nbsp; Not a fan of stickers? This plane would still look great without them.&nbsp; Another perk to the plane was the removeable crate storage underneath by the wheels.&nbsp; I also enjoyed the over-sized propellor and opening&nbsp;front end to access the detailed, pistoned&nbsp;engine.</p>
<p>The car is also original and I am impressed they did not duplicate any vehicles in these sets. Why it's a sweet ride:&nbsp; Outward v-cylindered motor, ability to actually hold 2 lego characters (why don't they still do this for the modern vehicles?) special map compartment, plenty of storage in back&nbsp;and retro-wheels.</p>
<p>Tons&nbsp;of accessories such as scorpions, film cameras, guns, tools, etc to go with the 5 characters. Very detailed decals on the map and camera film.</p>
<p>One might nitpick and say this set lacks any real scenery with just a camp-fire and palm tree, but I don't see it as such&nbsp;I think it was meant to be&nbsp;more as the travelling to adventure set a la great race style.</p>
<p>I found the Special Edition of this set which came in a large, plastic, sturdy, cylindrical&nbsp;container that had a Lego pharoah's face at the top.&nbsp; Very handy for storage and as a monolithic backdrop.&nbsp; Cool set especially if you score the bonus storage container.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"SquidBot","2011-05-28T02:55:36.023Z","Cool Car, Great Bi-Plane","Of all the vehicles in the Egyptian Adventurers theme, the two in this set are my favorites!<br><br>The villains (both included) have a sweet black car with an exposed engine and a rifle rack on the passenger side. The heroes, in this case the pilot and the professor figures, have a large biplane. I think it's a better looking plane than the similar one in the <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Bi-Wing Baron</span> (5928) set and it's bigger too. The nose of the plane has stickers that give it a shark-like smile. I usually don't put the stickers on my sets but these were too neat to pass up. They really do make the plane look cooler.<br><br>Though there isn't any sort of temple or Egyptian ruins in this set, the sarcophagus is elaborately painted and the palm tree is a nice touch. This set also includes the usual Adventurers accessories, like the large backpack, magnifying glass, maps, film camera, guns, shovels, and pickaxes. <br><br>Overall, this is one of the best Egyptian Adventurers sets. If you like the theme and don't already have this set, definitely pick it up online, especially if you can get it for around the original retail price. It is totally worth it!<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I like the container because it is reusable. It also looks really cool on display in my room.</p>

<p>The instructions are easy to follow.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>It has a nice collection&nbsp;of parts. &nbsp;I love the usable magnifying glass.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigs look good with great torso print detail to give them an historical look, and&nbsp;they are very rare now.</p>

<p>Is quite easy but fun! &nbsp;I&#39;d put it at age 6+</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Looks good and is great&nbsp;to play with.</p>
