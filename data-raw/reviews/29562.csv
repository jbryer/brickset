"RaiderOfTheLostBrick","2019-12-26T09:09:20.92Z","The One for the Fans","<p>I just got this for Christmas. I&rsquo;ve been pretty excited for this since it was announced considering I&rsquo;m a pretty hardcore Friends fan. Therefore, this review might be slightly biased. Anyway, let&rsquo;s get on with it...</p>

<p>The good:</p>

<p>- The central area is removable. This is good for anyone who might just wants&nbsp;to display the Figures.</p>

<p>-Incredible value. The set is $90 AUD for about 1060 pieces and 7 minifigures. For a Star Wars set of this size, the price is likely to be about $170 AUD.</p>

<p>- Plenty of Easter Eggs for fans and incredible detail.</p>

<p>The Mixed:</p>

<p>- The figures vary in greatness. Ross, Phoebe and Rachel are the best (even though the latter has the overused Jyn Erso&nbsp;head), Chandler and Monica are fine, but Joey barely resembles the character. I think it&rsquo;s the hair piece.</p>

<p>Gunther, meanwhile is an unexpected&nbsp;but brilliant figure who is a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>- Studio lights are pointless, but can be removed easily.</p>

<p>The Bad:</p>

<p>- Other than Joey, the only major letdown is the exterior. Two of the walls look like such a mess from the back. However you probably wouldn&rsquo;t display it from this angle, so it doesn&rsquo;t really matter.</p>

<p>- Monica and Phoebe&rsquo;s long hair can&rsquo;t fit into the backs of the couches.</p>

<p>The Verdict:</p>

<p>As a big fan of the series, this set is excellent. Of course, it has hit some bumps like Joey and a messy exterior, but in the end I&rsquo;ll be there for this set (when it hasn&rsquo;t been it&rsquo;s day, or week or month, or even it&rsquo;s year).</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m off to make a compatible MOC based on Monica&rsquo;s apartment to go above. Great set!</p>

"Samwise022","2020-09-13T13:36:25.677Z","Excellent Set!!","<p>This is a set that has been really well done by Lego. The detail in all the pieces and the accuracy of the set compared to the show is superb! I bought this in Australia brand new for $90 for my wife and believe it is worth every bit for this 1000+ Piece Themed Set.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-11-18T09:18:56.627Z","The One for Lego Lovers","<p>I remember when I was in high school and this new show came on at 7:00 on Thursdays, which was the only day that I had to watch TV because at 8:00 was Seinfeld. It had a catchy theme song and was pretty funny. So I started to make sure I always turned on the TV early to watch this new show called Friends. Well I guess I wasn&#39;t the only one who liked it...</p>

<p>Despite watching Friends religiously while I was in high school, I didn&#39;t really plan on purchasing this set. My wife who loves the show didn&#39;t say I should get it, so I figured I would just wait for the upcoming Seinfeld set as that is truly my favorite show. However, when I saw it for $10 off and realized it may not be available much longer, I decided I better get it before I regret not owning it. All I can say is that I&#39;ve never been happier that I&#39;ve purchased a Lego set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It doesn&#39;t matter if you are a huge fan of the show, if you are a huge fan of Lego then you are going to love this set. I&#39;ve never seen building techniques like the ones this set utilizes before, and it isn&#39;t just one technique, but many. I admit that most of Lego building is Star Wars and LOTR, but I have built a handful of &quot;houses&quot; and none are anything like this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Box and Instructions&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set features the usual Lego Ideas box with the locking flap, which I love. However, just like every other Ideas set I own, the box is just slightly too small to hold the completed model. In this particular case the lighting structures on the outside are too tall, but if removed it would fit in perfectly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions are excellent with a page about the show and another about with bios of the 6 main characters. Followed by a spread about the fan creator, and another for the Lego designers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigures&nbsp;</p>

<p>All the minifigures are excellent, with the attire perfectly representing outfits they would have worn on the show. I won&#39;t go into each individual minifigure as you can see the pictures, but I will say this, their facial expressions are spot on. Rachel&#39;s angry face is especially good as you can easily imagine her displaying that face after Ross does something inexcusable. I will also say that while the hair isn&#39;t always perfect, they did get Rachel&#39;s hair right, which obviously is incredibly important. The seventh minifigure in the set is Gunther, and while he may not have been necessary, considering you are building Central Perk, it is very nice to have him in the background.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This set features I very wide variety of colors, which is a very welcome change from the gray I usually get in Star Wars sets. It also includes tons of special pieces, cups, bottles, a tea cup, lamp posts, umbrellas, a guitar... Just tons of normal everyday items, which I suppose isn&#39;t a big deal if you are a City fan, but as I don&#39;t typically get those sets they are very unique pieces to me.</p>

<p>The Build</p>

<p>This is why I absolutely love this set. I&#39;ve never built anything like this before, and the geometries used are incredible. It would have been very simple for this set to have been designed strictly with 90 degree angles, and had they done that I doubt that anyone would have complained. However, what they did is introduce a whole bunch of wacky angles that are accomplished using a variety of techniques, and the best part, they don&#39;t leave a single gap. At the same time, they also made the set extremely strong, which is amazing given how much is going on in the structure. All of this was also accomplished without the use of any technic. The only technic in the set are a couple of pins that are used as studs, and a decorative detail that I assume is some sort of coffee maker.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I really can&#39;t go into detail on how everything gets built. The angles are primarily done with hinges and angled plates, but it isn&#39;t just the base, but also the counter, which cleverly uses cheese wedges and&nbsp;the studs on the floor to keep it perfectly rigid. One wall gets stopped from swinging by a stud which puts it in exactly the right place without it getting connected to the floor. That&#39;s right, the walls and floors don&#39;t always align, but still they are seamless and rigid. Best of all, it is completely asymmetrical, meaning there is 0 repetition.</p>

<p>Then you have the rugs that are built sideways and just rest inside the floor so that they can be easily removed to give you more space. I&#39;ve seen sideways construction on the Star Wars gift with purchase sets from the last two May the 4ths, but never seen it used as a removable component of a set before. This is actually pretty important because as large as this set it is, it is so jam packed with details that there isn&#39;t a whole lot of room for the minifigures to move around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But besides these major structural components, you also have all the details. From the coffee makers behind the counter, to the umbrella holder which is brilliantly designed sideways to the couches and tables. Just everything about this set is done differently so you are constantly changing building techniques.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Model</p>

<p>The size of this model is very impressive, I didn&#39;t expect such a large room, although I probably should have given the brick count. The attention to detail is wonderful and there is not a single wall or corner that lacks detail. Yes, there is only one outside wall that looks good, but that&#39;s fine, in real life the back walls would have butted up against other buildings anyways.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I do have two complaints however, but they are very minor. First, Idea sets typically feature printed bricks, and while this set has its fair share of printed bricks, it also has 5 stickers. Why couldn&#39;t they just print them all? Second is the stage lights. I feel like they make it more about filming the show than the show itself. Furthermore, they don&#39;t exactly look good, they take away from what would have been an amazing coffee shop. Yes, they can easily be removed, but why include them in the first place. Or if they felt it was important to make this set about filming a show rather than the show itself, then they should have included a cameraman.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, while I am a fan of Friends, and&nbsp;the subject matter of this set was&nbsp;the reason I bought it, it is the building experience that is the reason I love it. I don&#39;t think I can call it my favorite Lego set, and it isn&#39;t the most complex build either. However, this set has the most varied build I have ever seen in a Lego set, and it certainly taught me a lot of different non-standard techniques. Even if you aren&#39;t a fan of the show, you should buy this set because you are a fan of building Lego. You will never find a more fun and more varied build.&nbsp;</p>
