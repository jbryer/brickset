<p>This is the first visit to space for the Lego City Comic and introduces you to Astronaut Nils Legstrong.&nbsp; The comic was on sale between 28th August 2019 and 24th September.&nbsp; In addition to Nils you also get a great robot build.&nbsp; Attached to the front of the comic I also got the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/951810-1/Arctic-Explorer-with-Snowmobile"">Snowmobile</a> from issue 10, however if other comics are to go&nbsp;by this may not be the case with all comics and you might get something different.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The packet for the Astronaut is the larger foil pack, but the Snowmobile is in the older foil pack with stuck down flap.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Nils Legstrong is unique to this set for the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-City/year-2019/subtheme-Space"">2019 City Space</a> range, although&nbsp;his legs and torso&nbsp;are in about half the sets and his head is pretty standard.&nbsp; He comes with a black camera, which again is very common.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>The build of the robot, which Brickset shows as a Minifigure, is simple but creates a great companion for Nils.&nbsp; The use of the connecting pin allows it to rotate well and gives just enough movement.</p>

<p>I had one of the <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6186681/plate-1x1-w-3-2-shaft-and-1-5-hole"">parts missing </a>so could not connect both arms.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have spares from other sets so it was not an issue but does highlight the problem with Lego containing only the required number of parts with no spares in these sets.&nbsp; This is the only time I have had a part missing from a comic set, so it is rare.</p>

<p>I do like how all the robots in this theme are all different.&nbsp; The main City line contain one robot&nbsp;that <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/cty1066/city-space-robot-drone-medium-azure-eyes"">flies</a>, one that has <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/cty1056/city-space-robot-round-tiles-as-wheels-medium-azure-eyes"">wheels</a> and one that walks on <a href=""http://brickset.com/minifigs/cty1071/city-space-robot-standing-medium-azure-eyes"">long legs</a>.&nbsp; So this on caterpillar tracks is the perfect addition to the series.</p>

<p>You also get one of the new <a href=""http://brickset.com/parts/6264092/rock-crystal-no-1002"">Rock Crystals </a>too.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>Well worth picking up if you can.&nbsp; The comic was &pound;4.99 originally, which is fantastic value for money when you factor in getting the Snowmobile too.&nbsp; The set has two elements that can interact with each other to give it a good play rating, however either a small landscape section or larger rock to hide the Rock Crystal would have given it full marks.&nbsp; I hope the Lego Comic visit space again soon.</p>

<p>Next month the space exploration is over and it&#39;s time for a take-away as we get a Pizza Delivery Guy on a motorbike.</p>
