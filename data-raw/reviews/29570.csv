<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is a decent item included with the book. The book has a lot of great ideas in it, as we have covered in the book review itself. There isn&rsquo;t much to this set, it&rsquo;s a Polybag with parts and a Minifigure. I&rsquo;d recommend picking up the book if you can find it for a good price. The cost of these books can be rather high compared to other books, but as always if you can find them at Costco you can get them for half price. Recommended.</p>
