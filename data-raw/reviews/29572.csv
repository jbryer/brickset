Great colours&nbsp;&nbsp;as I don&rsquo;t have many orange pieces and&nbsp;I think the yellow pieces used for wig of scarecrow are neat cause first yellow pieces like this in my collection&nbsp;</p>

<p>. V artistic scarecrow. It&rsquo;s an attention grabber and a fun build. Unusual pieces for hands and they really make the set. Well done. I bought a couple extra to give away for Thanksgiving gifts.&nbsp;</p>
