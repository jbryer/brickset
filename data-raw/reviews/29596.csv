<p>On Triple Force Friday, I headed over to LEGO Shop to take advantage of the Star Wars deals. Upon browsing through the sets, I was completely taken by surprise: I had no idea LEGO was releasing these. Apparently, they were supposed to kept&nbsp;secret.</p>

<p>Loving BrickHeadz&nbsp;and Star Wars, this was a no-brainer purchase for me, despite their somewhat strange appearances. A few years back, I opted not to buy 41486 Captain Phasma, due to the shape of the helmet and the matte armor (it&#39;s meant to be shiny, LEGO!). The Sith Trooper, however, only has one of these flaws, so I said, &quot;Screw it.&quot;</p>

<h2>-Kylo Ren-</h2>

<h3>Building Experience&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Kylo Ren&#39;s construction is certainly different than that of most BrickHeadz, as his torso is three studs deep, with black plates built out to make the fourth &quot;stud.&quot; Some interesting techniques were used to make his cape appear to drape over his shoulders, and his hood was very cleverly constructed. All-in-all, a quite divergent and enjoyable building experience.</p>

<h3>Appearance</h3>

<p>To be honest, when I first saw the picture, I wasn&#39;t sure about his chunky-looking hood thing.&nbsp;However, upon building it and seeing it in person, all my worries have been relieved, as it actually looks quite good. Appropriately, his mask looks quite intimidating, matching the movie well. The torso is, well, the torso, being quite plain and&nbsp;matching the movie&nbsp;as it should. He comes equipped with his sweet lightsaber.</p>

<h2>-Sith Trooper-</h2>

<h3>Building Experience&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Pretty standard stuff when it comes to BrickHeadz, other than the mouthpiece. Not as fun to build as Kylo Ren.</p>

<h3>Appearance</h3>

<p>Like his Supreme Leader, this trooper looks better in person, although not to the same extent. This was slightly disappointing, but I can&#39;t think of how it could be made better. A&nbsp;mix of brick-built and printed details forms his square-jawed visage, kind of resembling the movie. The only other printing is on his (her?) belt, but black and red are used to good effect to portray the body glove and armor elsewhere. He is equipped with a blaster identical to that carried by 41485 Finn and 41620 Stormtrooper, albeit in red and black. Overall, not my favorite BrickHeadz, but I do dig the color scheme.</p>

<p>Edit: Upon further inspection, I noticed that the printing on the bottom part of the Sith Trooper&#39;s mask was off to the left&nbsp;by about 3 mm, creating a noticeable error in spacing with the top. This pretty is disappointing and should not have happened, so I thought&nbsp;I&#39;d warn you.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>-The Last Part-</h2>

<p>I would recommend this to anyone who&#39;s excited about the new movie&nbsp;or likes BrickHeadz, but I advise you to consider the appearance of the Sith Trooper first, as it can be off-putting for some people. I personally enjoyed adding these to my already large&nbsp;collection, and I&#39;m sure that most&nbsp;BrickHeadz&nbsp;fans would feel the same way, as they do stand out.</p>

<p>I should note that BrickHeadz are not intended for--so have very little--play value; however, if you have a child that enjoys playing with Pop! Vinyls, then they may enjoy these.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>May the Brick be with you!</em></p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-11-07T12:49:20.647Z","The Final Order Team-Up","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #75232 Kylo Ren &amp; Sith Trooper:</b> Just when you thought BrickHeadz were forever relegated to the life of LEGO Store Seasonal builds only, here&rsquo;s another Star Wars inspired duo just in time for Rise of Skywalker. These two models are extremely enjoyable and fun, and the set itself is definitely worth picking up for fans of this style of building.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The box is relatively simple for this duo, no fancy logos, nothing really standing out, just two models shown on the front and back and the Star Wars LOGO in the lower corner in the traditional screen-crawl font. The side shows the characters in live action of course, but other than that there is very little to differentiate this from any other BrickHeadz Star Wars release.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Each build has its own manual, so you get two for the price of one&hellip; heh, just kidding. One thing to note this is the first BrickHeadz set I have picked up to date which has not had folded manuals, these two were flat straight out of the box and more of an actual booklet design compared to any other BrickHeadz set I have had the pleasure of building.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">There are twenty-nine large headlight bricks in this set, as two BrickHeadz are built here that makes sense. You&rsquo;ll find a few printed elements for Kylo&rsquo;s face and torso detailing and a lot more for the Sith Trooper which is a solid looking model and the printed elements are somewhat similar to the parts in Finn for the belt and pouches of the Stormtroopers of the First Order.</span></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Building BrickHeadz at this point is highly repetitive and the same we&rsquo;ve seen in many sets and reviews by now. The two characters in this unexpected set featuring Rise of Skywalker characters are extremely impressive. Kylo Ren uses similar techniques to The Last Jedi version, this Kylo has his helmet and a wider cape design, the build on him is extremely impressive. He works quite well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Sith Trooper build is extremely similar to the Finn BrickHeadz character. Sharing build steps, but using different coloured elements, so it isn&rsquo;t exactly the same. However if you bought and built Finn then you can build it all from memory, even the gun is the same build just red and black instead of white and black.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kylo Ren has a wide cape and his signature helmet with scarring on it. His printed details enhance the look of the BrickHead and you can now put helmeted and unhelmeted Kylo&rsquo;s on your BrickHeadz shelf.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Sith Trooper is a stand out build and model, it is such a cool and fun design that I kind of wish LEGO would have or could release a single packed version of this character to get a few more to build a squad of them to put on the shelf. It is such a great looking BrickHead that I also wonder why we didn&rsquo;t also get First Order Stormtroopers, but as BrickHeadz are not dead we may see more Star Wars characters released in this design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The red and black colouring of the Sith Trooper just looks superb on the shelf, and he looks great next to Kylo and Captain Phasma.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a must own set. Fans of Star Wars BrickHeadz will want to pick it up, and fans of BrickHeadz in general will adore the impressive detailing on Kylo and the Sith Trooper. The biggest deterrent for getting this set would just be the availability, it may wind up being harder to find now that we&rsquo;re closer to the holidays. Highly recommended.</p>
