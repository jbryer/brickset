<p>Following last months&nbsp;visit to space we are back down to earth and feeling hungry, so Issue 19 of the Lego City Comic gives you Ben Ryder on his pizza delivery bike.&nbsp; This particular issue was on sale from 25th September 2019 and 22nd October 2019.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The larger foil pack shows Ben riding his bike to deliver a few boxes of pizza.&nbsp; He is holding one in the air, which is not being carried flat so there may be an unhappy customer later!&nbsp; The packet&nbsp;suggests you need to be over 6 for this, but younger kids would be fine with the build - supervised of course.</p>

<p>On the back it has the 1x1 image of the 2x2 pizza box&nbsp;tile.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Ben Ryder is unique to this set, his head has been used in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6153335"">15 sets</a> including four of the People Packs, his torso is also common and has appeared in 11 sets since 2016.&nbsp; His legs are plain Earth Blue and he has a black crash helmet.</p>

<p>In the comic you see Ben without his helmet sporting a mohican hair style, but you don&#39;t get the hair element to match.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>The build is complete in four steps as it is only a motorcycle, which you could probably build in a matter of seconds.&nbsp; The pizza boxes, one printed and two 2x2 jumper plates, simply stick to the back of the bike - so doubtful that they would still be there once Ben reaches the customer.</p>

<p>The bike is basically the same as the one that appears in 60214: Burger Bar Fire Rescue, 60216: Downtown Fire Brigade&nbsp;and a couple of Batman sets.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>For me the motorbike is completely the wrong type for a pizza delivery bike.&nbsp; A bike like the&nbsp;scooter in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/60150-1/Pizza-Van"">60150</a>: Pizza Van (part 15396)&nbsp;would have been much better, especially in a new colour like white or blue.&nbsp; Ignoring the pizza element you get a nice bike that is not for fire rescue with a good Minifigure that would compliment most Lego cities.</p>

<p>This comic cost &pound;4.25, so a reduction from last month but only one set so very reasonable in my view.&nbsp; Inclusion of a hair element would have helped.</p>

<p>Next month is a female police officer with a speed trap, so Ben had better make sure that he delivers his pizza&#39;s while obeying the speed limit of Lego City.</p>
