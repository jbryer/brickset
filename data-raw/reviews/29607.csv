<p>Issue one of the Hidden Side Lego Comic was released on 25th September 2019 and priced &pound;3.99.&nbsp; Attached to the front was Jack Davids, the main character from Lego&#39;s new sub theme, Hidden Side.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The packet that Jack comes in is the older foil pack with a glued flap.&nbsp; This could indicate that Lego were going to release this before now and later issues will have the slightly larger packet, or it could just be that they wanted to use this type.&nbsp; It just seems strange that other comics have&nbsp;moved away from this packaging but not here.</p>

<p>Within the packet you only get 8 pieces, which is in line with collectable Minifigures so maybe one day they might switch to similar packaging for comic sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Jack appears here exactly as he does in <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70418-1/J-B-s-Ghost-Lab"">JB&#39;s Ghost Lab</a> and the <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/70424-1/Ghost-Train-Express"">Ghost Train Express</a>.&nbsp; However in this iteration he comes with a selfie stick along with his ever present&nbsp;mobile phone.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>There is not much to say here as the build is a Minifigure with a printed 1x2 tile and camera on a stick.&nbsp; For me the camera connects with&nbsp;a strange connection as it feels like it is wedged in place.&nbsp; Nowhere in the comic has instructions on building this but on the front&nbsp;cover of the comic&nbsp;you can see the problem.&nbsp; My six-year-old struggled to&nbsp;make it work and ended up putting the camera vertical so it clicked nicely together.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;set&nbsp;contains Jack&#39;s mobile phone, which appears every time Jack does&nbsp;at the time of release.&nbsp; You also get Jack&#39;s hat and hood element which is dual molded.&nbsp; Jack&#39;s&nbsp;head is also double sided and currently unique to the theme.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>I like the Minifigure, and the first comic of the series had to start with the main character so there is no complaint there.&nbsp; However the strange connection for the camera marks it down a point.</p>

<p>Additionally, the idea of this series is to use your app with your Lego.&nbsp; This works fine with the&nbsp;main sets where you select the colour it requests&nbsp;and scan.&nbsp; This Minifigure does not have the same functionality.&nbsp; You can use the scan figure part of the app, but it did&nbsp;not specifically know it was from this set.&nbsp; As this version of Jack appears in two of the sets I suppose this would stop it working as a unique figure.&nbsp; However as the whole idea of the theme is related to the app I think they should have had something that linked this to it - even if it was a page in the comic.</p>
