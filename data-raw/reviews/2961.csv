The figs are good, but we've had the Baron way too many times.  I like the villainess; that's new for the Adventurers series.  The hunter guy is okay, but the hat that he wears is Johnny Thunder's hat, and I have about a million of those.
The dinos are cool, but they aren't to scale.

The set has good parts, but nothing groundbreaking or special.

The best part about this set is how much fun it is!  You can catch a dino with a net on the move with the car, or make the dino step on the platform to eat the leaves, and catch it with the net.  

All in all, I think that all the adventurers sets are great fun and this one is no exception!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-08T00:55:54Z","All Three","I don't know wether there has been any other Adventurers sets that had all the villains (Well apart from the really expensive ones). This would have been my first Adventurers set, and it was a very good introduction to it. All the really cool traps (The car was my favourite) and the dinosaurs. Itâ€™s still an invaluable set now. Buy it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-30T18:36:34.17Z","great set and works woderfuly","every thing works like it should, the trap is a bit simple but still great. the boat/car is cool looking and has everything it needs to be one or the other like a propeler, big wheels two person cabin and a net launcher that fires when you run into sumthing. the little bas is ok, it has water, a fire, and tsome greenery. i like this set and im glad i got it",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
