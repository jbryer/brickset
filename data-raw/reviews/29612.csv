<p>This set contains one Elsa&#39;s throne, one table with food, and one Elsa Minidoll.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elsa the Minidoll is pretty cool in a neat shade of purple kinda a violet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The table in a nice little build which is about two inches long. It has a bunch of stuff on top including a golden cup, a candy bar, a crown, and a dish with a cherry cake atop.</p>

<p>The throne is also a neat build with a cool use of parts to get some slopping. It is just shy of three inches tall and can hold Elsa on it. Or sort of. This is my biggest complaint about it...</p>

<p>The throne is nit deep enough for Elsa. Her hair is a little two bulky in the back making it a little bit hard to sit her on her throne.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am a guy and was thinking that this set would look good in one of those Alpha team sets that was a big ice fortress. Also it would look good with some of the fire and ice Chima sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Aside from that i think this set is really kinda neat, and is a must have for any Lego Disney collector.&nbsp;</p>

This Polybag is difficult to find at retail, but well worth tracking down if you&rsquo;d care to get a nice Elsa Mini-Doll at a decent price.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Engaging little model to build and play with.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Unique elements such as the zipline bricks and clear blue wall element included.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Elsa at a very cheap price in a stunning new outfit and with a very nice hair piece.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Throne does not seat Mini-Doll properly.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Difficult to find at retail.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I highly recommend tracking this set down. The model is very impressive and looks great, it also wouldn&rsquo;t take much to alter the model to better fit Elsa in the throne. The parts in the set are nice to get too. Highly Recommended.</p>
