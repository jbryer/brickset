"1947andallthat","2020-01-05T14:14:37.187Z","The single best GWP ever","<p>I&#39;ll start with the easy thing to say; this is the best free gift I have ever had from Lego. As a partner to the astonishing larger vehicle with which it was briefly available, and as a nicely rounded model in its own right, it&#39;s an astounding little thing to have (and, considering the problems faced by customers in the first few hours of online release, I would imagine a quite rare item).</p>

<p><strong>Box &amp; Instructions</strong></p>

<p>A surprisingly large box is included here, but it is still one of the smallest boxes I know of with taped seals: this and the impressive box art and Limited Edition branding make it very clear that this is a model of the highest standards. Inside, four numbered bags, a substantial instruction booklet and a single sticker for the information plaque can be found.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>There&#39;s nothing particularly special here, and the four separate stages make the build even easier, but it&#39;s never boring, the model comes together nicely, and the only things which might annoy are the air intakes, which are all too easily nudged out of line.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>No, it&#39;s not much of a parts mine, but a couple of things present, such as the base of a 1x2 hinge in tan and the new style black large bows aren&#39;t common.</p>

<p><strong>The Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>The finished vehicle is a thing of absolute beauty. I don&#39;t have 2019&#39;s other minifig scale Burton-style Batmobile for comparison, but set images have convinced me that my model is significantly more refined. This model looks to be ever so slightly shorter, but the piece count has been increased, allowing for the inclusion of more detail and a lovely display stand emulating the larger vehicle&#39;s. The rotating stand provides a lovely and professional way to display the car (and, I have to say, provides 3 minutes of first rate entertainment to people who like spinning things), although it is a matter of trial, error and slight frustration trying to sit it properly on the stand. However, the car itself is simply flawless. The famous powerful &amp; menacing silhouette has been replicated almost perfectly, and only a handful of exposed studs are visible, making for an extremely graceful model. Lots of nice details have been incorporated, many missing from the other small model: the front elevation, with a wheel hub used in the air intake, is spot on; the mechanical detailing visible beneath the cockpit is excellent considering the small scale; and the presence of the four secondary exhausts at the rear is a welcome surprise. The giant flame emerging from the main exhaust may be off-putting to some planning to display the model, but does facilitate the most satisfying&nbsp;gimmick, albeit lifted straight from the other vehicle; when the rear wheels are driven, the flame rotates nicely. The other play feature, the stud shooters at the front, are a nice approximation of the car&#39;s machine guns, and are easily replaced if you find them too obtrusive. The cockpit&#39;s exposed Technic beams are a mild bugbear, but the nice tan upholstery, printed controls, hinged roof, and the emulation of the smaller circular windows just behind all work nicely.</p>

<p><strong>Verdict</strong></p>

<p>This is a lovely little model, and a worthy addition to any display. Other than the couple of minor niggles I detailed above, the only thing missing is minifgures, but when Lego&nbsp;need an incentive for people to buy the other minifig-scale Batmobile&nbsp;this year, I can see it was a pretty forlorn hope to ask for them. So, if you missed this first time round and it comes out again, or you find a copy for less than &pound;35-40 online, I wholeheartedly recommend you go out of your way to grab a copy.</p>
