<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>I always like this particular ship. I think it&#39;s one of the best design from prequel trilogy. This version is third iteration microscale Jedi Interceptor (old: 6966 &amp; 30244). It is the smallest of whole trio. It looks great, shapes is captured well. Characteristic flaps looks perfect, though are little bit too big. Design of canopy doesn&#39;t change since the beginning&nbsp;and still is great. Colouring is done pretty nice (I love everything that is yellow). It missing some thing like angled down wings, which doesn&#39;t bother me at all, and artoo&nbsp;head on wing, which is ok in this scale.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grill tiles on wings add some details. I like the idea of making guns from plate with stick, instead of a standard stick like in previous versions. Engine made traditionally&nbsp;from transparent studs is great. Overall it is a really nice&nbsp;build.</p>

<p><b>Parts</b></p>

<p>In my opinion very useful. Pair of wings in yellow, angled plate, flags in yellow, brackets are always great.&nbsp;</p>
