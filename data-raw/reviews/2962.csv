So a couple years later I bought it off EBAY, which came with the blimp and all the figs except one. I also didn't get the little island that came with the gold and the spider web. 
It comes with Jonney thunder, the doctor guy and a pilot. It also comes with a villan but I didn't get him so I can't really describe him. 
Jonney thunder- He is in his tan clothes and comes with a shotgun.
Doctor- He is in his white shirt with green pants and comes with a magnifing glass that actualy works and binoculars.
Pilot- He is in a brown jacket and comes with a helmet that has goggles attached.
The blimp is great with a HUGE cargo area in the balloon itself. It is a great place to keep extra legos or gear for the explorers. The only bad thing about this set is that many of the pieces are very fragile and fall off easily. It may be frustrating to get the pieces back on.This isn't really too much of a problem though. 
An extra feature or piece should I say, is a skull in the back of the blimp with a jar over it. Its pretty cool. All in all this is a great set. If you like Jonney Thunder and all of his adventures you should definetly get this set.5/5 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

A zeppelin in Lego was a good idea on paper and great in Lego format. I like the overall design of the zeppelin and the baloon isn't made of rubber which is good and the anchor is kind of cool too. Overall, this is probably the best Jungle set in the Adventurers series.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

I still have parts of this set in my collection (Blimp balloon is gone though D:) Anyway this was a really fun set for us back then and I remember pretending the balloon was a giant flying shark :P Good Times, Good Legos",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BasiltheBatlord","2009-08-13T17:54:39.153Z","Adventurer's Zepplin!","An excellent example of the classic jungle series, this set has an awsome blimp, the adventurer's main vehicle for jungle. It has two realistic motors and propellers, and an anchor. there is a space for the pilot, and a sort of lab area in the back for Dr. Kilroy. it contains a shelf with skull in a glass dome. 

The set also includes a small jungle shrine, with a pull-out plinith that has a golden idol on it, guarded by a spider. the set has Johny Thunder, Dr. Kilroy, with a rifle, Harry Cane, The adventuer's pilot, and Max Villano, with a backpack, rifle, and machete.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-27T10:29:02.37Z","LEGO Adventurers (Jungle) - Expedition Balloon Review","This is the first and only LEGO set which comes with a zeppelin. The whole balloon is a big piece and it's so big that you can store your pieces in it if you want. The only problem is that this balloon has lot's of stickers but these make the set looking cool. The huge brick is attached to some LEGO Technic pieces and on the back of the zeppelin you can see a propeller on each side which sviwels full 360Â°. Behind the propellers you can also find an engine which does sviwel. On the front is a movable windscreen and on the side is a microscope. This zeppelin also has an anchor which is attached to a chain.<br><br>We also get a tomb in this set with a web which sviwels and a golden plate which is attached to a rock. You're able to slide this rock out of the tomb as well. I also can't complain about the number of minifigs we get in this set. This set also includes Johnny Thunder who is in lot's of LEGO Adventurers sets. But I'm really happy to have this set. I'm sure that this is a great must have set. It's an easy and fun build and the whole zeppelin is very sturdy as well.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Dirac","2014-11-07T01:30:52.787Z","Unique and vintage","<p>This is the only time Lego has made a dirigible so it is definitely unique for that reason alone. But it was executed in great fashion as well, back in the day it was a hype between all the kids I knew and I was really proud I got one back then and still managed to found it in quite good condition after all these years!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t normally write about the box as it was never a thing I (or anyone for that matter I suppose) would buy a Lego set for, but the packaging here was very original - the balloon was sticking right out of it, making it very attractive for kids even when exposed on the shop shelf. Some parts were in fact packaged right inside the balloon, which is a two-piece element, screwed together. Part of the box was also recommended in the instructions to use in order to keep the balloon stable while mounting it to the rest of the vehicle.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Obviously, the zeppelin is the stand alone piece here and the main reason anyone would buy it. It has a few stickers on it, some need to be placed quite accurately while some (the patches) can be left to builders imagination. To my surprise, after finding it now, the stickers are still in good condition 15 years later.</p>

<p>Besides that, there&#39;s a few more quite rare parts - the chrome shield with Amazon idol, spider on a web, the pieces that form a small cabinet inside the dirigible and utensils, such as a magnifying glass (that really works!), black binoculars, two guns, openable backpack and sabre. I also like the anchor and the way it is mounted on the chain.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>It comes with four jungle Adventurers minifigures - standard Johnny Thunder, pilot Harry Cane in a neat helmet, Doctor Killroy and Max Villano. The amount of minifigures is satisfying for the size of the set and they make for a good crew of the vehicle + the villain who&#39;s trying to shoot it.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build is quite simple and straightforward, the only challenge might be joining the balloon with the rest of the model. It uses some technic pieces to mount the balloon and despite feeling quite loose on standard swiveling technic pipes, it is quite solid.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The model looks amazing and is sturdy and light enough to &quot;fly&quot; it in the air with your hand (fully swooshable!). The small jungle altar isn&#39;t much, but it&#39;s a nice addition to give some &quot;mission&quot; feel for the zeppelin. There are some nice details in the balloon, such as a microscope (made with the use of binoculars) and laboratory with a skull inside a glass dome. The model catches that vintage feeling, reminiscent&nbsp;of that &quot;Young Indiana Jones&quot; series with Sean Patrick Flannery.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>It is a great set, definitely worth acquiring, if you have a chance to! One of the most original, yet realistic, vehicles Lego has ever created!</p>
