This set is inspired by the short animated featurette involving Olaf hunting for Holiday Traditions&hellip; I forget what the title was, it&rsquo;s been a while since I saw it. Either way, this set is not Frozen II, but still branded as such, because it&rsquo;s what the entire sub-theme from Disney is meant to be marketed under.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It&rsquo;s honestly a pretty great set, and I feel it was worth the slightly inflated prices for Frozen II sets back in October.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This small box shows the set in action on the front and some play ideas on the back complete with the animated Mini-Dolls matching the look of the actual animated scene shown on the front of the box. All of the Frozen II sets have a white snowy look with a forest tree image on the front, it&rsquo;s a nice design and works well for what it is.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is loaded with purple elements, dark and light, some nice gold elements including the lantern element from Wizarding World in gold and two gold tooth elements. Jewels, skies, ski poles, Olaf&rsquo;s new Minifigure style body and head and that should cover all the reasons to want this set. The parts are just awesome.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Olaf: Newly sculpted and replacing the Brick-Built version of previous years, this Olaf is made up of three pieces, a new torso that can attach to studs and includes a hole for Mini-Doll accessories, as well as a decent print with little flakes of snow as well as the coal buttons. His head isn&rsquo;t new, it&rsquo;s the same element we saw since Frozen was introduced to LEGO Disney/Disney Princess line, the new torso element was probably introduced to allow Olaf to actually hold Mini-Doll/Minifigure accessories, it was a very nice decision to re-design him.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This build was done in sections, you had the sleigh with Christmas Tree attached to start with and then the larger sleigh. This build was pretty engaging, loved the way they made the runners for the sleigh, I think they were using Speed Champion spoiler parts or something.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The tree is a pretty nice build, unique and different from most Creator trees I&rsquo;ve built, the sleigh is pretty clever too, with the nice blend of dark and light purples with teal elements to give it a festive colouring.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Olaf&rsquo;s Sleigh is a very impressive model. For what it is, I don&rsquo;t see a whole lot of festive winter based models, I have rarely been able to get any of the Winter Village sets and most Christmas sets I wind up with are Polybags that don&rsquo;t feature such fun or bulky models. Therefore I am confident in saying this is one of the best Christmas Sleigh sets I&rsquo;ve ever built. The model is pure fun and really great fun to play with. Help Olaf take the presents and the tree to Anna and Elsa and spread the new Holiday traditions of Arendelle.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This was a great giveaway. It features a solid model to build and have fun with, a great new version of Olaf and for the price you can&rsquo;t go wrong. I&rsquo;d recommend trying to get your hands on this set for any Frozen fan. Strongly Recommended.</p>
