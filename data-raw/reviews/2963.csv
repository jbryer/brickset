"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-25T16:16:12Z","Hmmmm","Well... its OK, but nothing else.  It has goods bits and parts to it, but over all the architect of the set stinks. It's a good way to get the mummy, Johnny, and one of the bad guys, but other than that, I don't think it deserves anything better than a six.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Nova_Hunter","2007-05-07T15:18:59.06Z","Good medium-sized Adventurers set.","The Mummy's Tomb is one of the smaller structures of the Egyptian Adventurers theme. It isn't quite as solid as the larger Adventurers sets, yet it is still a good set for those without much money.

A small sports car is included in this set. Unlike most of the Adventurers cars, which are little more than seats, wheels and boxes, this one has a more unique design, omitting the box entirely. It looks as though it could go faster than the other Adventurers cars, though it cannot hold as much cargo. The printed windshield is a nice addition.

The tomb itself has two booby-trap mechanisms: One involves moving the statue on the right; two spears will come your way. The other is a simple falling obelisk. They work quite well, and the statue itself is nicely designed. Inside the tomb is a red sarcophagus lid (Where's the bottom?) that can spin to reveal a mummy standing on the other side. There is also a 1 x 2 x 3 train window inside, which is used to keep the mummy's headdress from bumping into the wall and forcing the mummy to bend over.

The minifigs include Johnny Thunder, Slyboots (The man in black), Dr. Kilroy (The man with the glasses), and the mummy. They are included in many other sets, but this is a good way to get all four.

I would recommend this set if you don't have the money for a larger Egyptian set, as it is still a pretty good set for your money, and the unique car makes it a bit better.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"deluckybrick","2007-07-16T17:21:08.59Z","A very good set.","This set is good if you are just beginning in Adventurers, because the playability is huge. The structure holds together well, even if it isnt too well designed. And I must say...

Good job with the spears!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"WiseWarrior","2008-10-31T23:33:58.53Z","Best desert set I own","This is an excellent set. It has tons of cool features, like the falling pillar and spear, the turning mummy, and more. The mummy is very detailed, and a great addition to the set. The car is also good. I'll admit it isn't the most well designed set, but it sure is the most fun.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2010-11-19T18:33:44.4Z","Mummy's Tomb Review","<p>This is a good little set with lots of little details and features going for it.

"jb_builder","2011-03-16T15:22:14.84Z","OUT STANDING! GET IT YOU WON'T REGRET IT!","<p>I got this off e bay a year ago and as soon as I opened it and saw the pieces I&nbsp;screamed. And I am&nbsp;a boy.</p>
<p>Any how lets start with the pieces. The pieces are all nice high quality color. And believe it or not there are no stickers! I was amazed at how much detail the car had. It even had a printed crack on the window! That was enough to blow my mind.And the coffin was insane.</p>
<p>And now for the traps. The spear trap works like a charm and it is so fun that I can do it all day and never get tired. The&nbsp;falling obelisk tower&nbsp;works well&nbsp;and looks very nice too.</p>
<p>I think the statue is the most amasing thing I have ever seen,&nbsp;it is truly beautiful.</p>
<p>The palm tree is very nice and the mini figs are great.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I highly suggest this set but dont pay over $50 for it. </p>

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-09T04:56:55.04Z","LEGO Adventurers (Desert) - Mummy's Tomb Review","This set is really fun to build and to play with. It comes with a really nice looking car and some nice traps which you can use to kill the bad guys. I like the way how LEGO made the obelisk falling down. There's also a statue which you can slide to make the spears sliding to the enemy. Another play feature we get here is that there's a platform which you can sviwel. On the back you can see a red ceiling of a sarcophagus and on the front you can see the mummy. It's a really nice set to have and it's very sturdy. We also don't get any stickers to worry about.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"LegoMunchy88","2011-06-03T16:54:11.7Z","A Nice Small Set","<p>Well, I'm probably not the person to review this set, because I think 5988 Pharaoh's Forbidden Ruins is so much better, so I don't really appreciate this set to much. But, nevertheless, I'll try my best. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pharaoh Hotep: Well, of course he's nice, he's the villian of the series. Great parts and a great minifigure, he's my faovrite of the set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Slyboot: Ok, everybody is going to ask who Slyboot is. Well, Slyboot is who the media has mistaken to Sam Sinister. You can check Brickpedia, it's true. Anyway, I think all of these extra villians are unimportant. It coul've just been Pharaoh Hotep and his minions vs. Johnny Thunder and the rest. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnny Thunder: Just ok, the hats nice, but besides that, just alright. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Kilroy: I happen to think that Dr. Kilroy is a very neat minifugre. He's got a cool hat and a neat backpack. Overall, very nice. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trap is very well done, and Kilroy is the perfect unsuspecting innocent little victim to be hit by it. One of my favorite traps, but it pales in comparison to the rest. Pharaoh Hotep's coffin piece is really cool, and the only set to have a red coofin piece. The Egyptian pieces are nice, and I'm so glad they're not stickers. The palm is also nice, it adds to the Egyptian feel of it all</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, Mummy's Tomb is a very nice set. It's a good way to get some great parts and minifigures without spending too much. And, Pharaoh Hotep is just an amazing minifigure. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
