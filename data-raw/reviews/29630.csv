<p>I never had a big dinosaur phase growing up but who isn&#39;t a little bit interested? Triceratops was always my favourite so it was nice to build one, especially after so many lego versions have been large chunks of plastic.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I bought this set mainly for parts and it excels in that department. to have so many bricks, tiles, decorative, hinged, and technic pieces all in the same color. This also makes the build a lot more difficult and time consuming, which I appreciated. PPP ratio is great! almost 1.5 pcs per 10&cent;, and a ton of minifig accessories too! Another human skeleton is always useful. I think.</p>

<p>The main problem here is playability. These are very much display-only sets. The legs on the T-Rex and Triceratops are not poseable and have roots inside the display stands and the feet are not attached. Quirky and adds a bit of realism as real museum casts wouldn&#39;t hold their own weight without muscle either.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I tried to move the triceratops to display it and several areas fell apart. Posing the tail often snaps sections off. Many sections are securely held in place with fun techniques but it&#39;s very easy to cause the bigger two to fall apart. The T-rex&#39;s neck can barely support its head and if tilting it up, gravity will pull it off during the downswing. The jaw surprisingly stays in place, connected with 4 battle droid arms. And the shaping of the skull is just spectacular. As stated I bought this set for parts but now I&#39;m struggling to find the... courage? to&nbsp;take apart the T-rex. The skull is just too beautiful &nbsp;</p>

<p>in summary, great set for parts, display,&nbsp;and a fun build, but not suitable as a toy. Thankfully Jurassic World has a more kid-friendly T-rex skeleton.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also worth noting I was missing 3-5 pieces</p>
