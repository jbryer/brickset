<p>This month the Lego City Comic gives us yet another member of the Police Force.&nbsp; This particular one comes with a speed camera and paddle to indicate that cars should stop.&nbsp; Hopefully the streets of your Lego City will be safer with this addition.&nbsp; This duty falls to Sam Solo.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The image of Sam and her speed recording camera fills the front of the foil packet.&nbsp; The image does not fill you with excitement, but then this set has limited play value and Lego have done the best with what they have.</p>

<p>It says you should be over six for this set, however younger builders will have no problem putting this together.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Sam Solo is the only Minifigure you get with this, although the comic has an older&nbsp;set attached this month.&nbsp; The parts are quite common and can be obtained from sets ranging in price, with her head appearing in a surprisingly high number of lower priced sets - so it&#39;s likely that most Lego cities will already feature this element.&nbsp; The Police torso is very common too.</p>

<p>The dual moulded hat/hair is probably the best part in this set.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>This will take you less than a minute to build.&nbsp; The sub-build in this pack is only really there to add a few parts and give the Minifigure&nbsp;a role to perform.&nbsp; They could maybe have included a 4X4 plate to attach the camera rather than the round one, but when connected to a base plate it holds up well enough.&nbsp; The camera can be positioned in a full 360 degrees, allowing it to track vehicles, due to only connecting to one stud.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>This is far from my favourite Lego City Comic set, but if you have some of the others it can add an element of play.&nbsp; By itself however it offers very little play value.&nbsp; I would not recommend tracking this down if you didn&#39;t get it originally - I got two on the front of my comic which makes me think that there was an error somewhere as the comic contained the instructions for the Police Motorbike.&nbsp; I expect this to appear attached to one of the future comics in 2020 as the additional set.</p>

<p>The comic was &pound;4.99, which is very good value for a comic and two Lego sets.</p>

<p>Next month is back to space with a space buggy.</p>
