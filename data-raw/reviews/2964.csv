"A_Brickset_user","2004-08-07T11:31:11Z","Not the Best Construction","  I purchased one of these on EBay last week. I like the concept of traveling by boat to dino island and then capturing a single-color rex or triceratops. The boat is large and has an area on top of the ship for steering and a boiler/engineering section at its rear. Unfortunately, the rear of the ship appears blocky esp. with a square steam stack? Round bricks are used at the front of the ship for the flag-pole? Lastly, the ship has no place for loading the dinos or cargo. A hoist of some kind would have really added value. The ship in 5976 (River Expedition), is much smaller, but by far more detailed and better constructed.
  I like the trailer cage but the truck part of the vehicle could have been better done. And lastly, the blue jeep is awkwardly constructed and has a strange assortment of colors. 
  The t-rex is 3 pieces that includes main body, tail, and upper head/mouth (all in the same bright green). Does not stand well on an un-flat surface. I like the triceratops in comparison but it does have a rather small head.
  This set has good playability based on its concept but like the research compound and the entire dino island theme, it lacks good detail and just seems to be an odd assortment of pieces in too many colors. 
  I would have liked to see this set redone and improved in the Orient Expedition theme - maybe a future dino island or lost world adventurer theme. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

But one of the bad things about it is that the dinosaur sizes are very wrong. A T-Rex is about 25ft high! But if you put a minifig next to it, it's half the size of it! Oh well, this set is still awesome. In fact, I even build a cage out of my stupid Best Locks and made a cage for the T-Rex! Oh, and I also love the Trike, the boat, the cars, the minifigs, and also the baby T-Rex! Aww!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

All in all, a great, fun, wonderful set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-11T02:17:31.2Z","Almost rates a 5 but not quite.","The boat is larger than you might think once its put together. You get three Dino's, a truck and trailer to transport the beasts to the boat. I really like the young looking boy mini figure. This is a very nice set, nothing to fancy but great hard to find pieces and alot of building. If I remember correctly this set use to retail for about $50.00. I recommend this set for Adventure collectors.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Yoda____","2008-10-29T15:11:12.75Z","dino's rock","I love these sets and lego shouldn't have waited until dino 2010 to do more. The boat was really cool but when I was a child I always thought that the T-rex transport was main model. These dinosaurs look ultraawesome and there's a cool little piece that you put in the back of the camera recorder that shows Johnny Thunder with the T-rex behind him. Unfortunately I lost the baby T-rex :-(",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Peri","2009-06-06T16:45:57.733Z","Good ol' Johnny...","This was my first Lego set, and as such it brings about great memories. One important point I didn't comprehend when I first got this is the great amount of accessories you get. You get pickaxes, rifles, pistols, crates, a mug, a camera, and a shovel. If I'm not mistaken, this an awesome amount of accessories. 

The T-Rex in this set is nice, though it's size is not that proportionate to the Minifigs... *cough*Dino Attack*cough*. It also re-uses the Castle Dragon arms, adding an awkward look.

I'm much more partial to the triceratops. The detail and double coloring really top it off.

Next, the boat. It's simple, but it works wonderfully. The raised steering platform is a nice touch. My favorite part is the stove. It is an over-the-top touch, adding great authentication. 

The T-Rex transport is okay. I don't see how , it being how it is, could hold the might of a T-Rex. But I guess not everything can be perfect. It still has a nice storage area and license plate.

The third vehicle, the Sinister family jeep. It's really just a nice throw-in that completes the set. 

Overall, I am glad I got this set. It seems like so long ago I picked it up...

Minifigs: 5/5- The whole crew's there!
Design: 4/5- The only irk I have is the smallness of the T-Rex transport.
Price: *shrugs* I didn't pay for it!
Overall: 4.5/5- Awesome set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-14T09:22:05.823Z","LEGO Adventurers (Dino Island) - T-Rex Transport Review","This set is a really cool set to have and it's very fun to build. We get lot's of stuff like a truck, a jeep, a ship and some dinosaurs. The trailer can be removed from the truck and the dinosaurs will fit in very easily. On the trailer is only room for one dinosuar. On the big ship is room for only one dinosaur as well. The design of this ship looks cool but it won't float on water. The ship is very long and on each side you can see a ladder where the driver can climb up and we also get a nice engine on the back. The jeep itself looks very cool. We get a trunk where you can put the accessories and it's really easy to maneuver it. I really can't complain about this set and we also don't get any stickers to worry about.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

The only not so great part is the building experience simply because it's more or less simple.<div><br></div><h4>Parts and Value for Money</h4><div>This set is very nice when it comes to parts. Many minifigure accessories, 5 minifigures, 3 dinosaurs (I lost the Triceratops and the Baby T-Rex, along with the T-Rex head). There are also some cage bars, a license plate, and a few other nice parts. The price is quite low for such a nice set.</div><div><br></div><h4>Playability</h4><div>This is a LEGO set, there's not much to say.
