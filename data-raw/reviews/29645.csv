A Hasbro property which began life in a brick-building world owned by Hasbro. Yes they started life in a competition brand which sold pretty much only in Asian markets because most retailers weren&rsquo;t supporting this particular brand anymore in North America.<br />
<br />
Or at least in Canada, they may have arrived in United States Retailers like Five Below or T.J.Maxx, but I never saw them. It makes sense that Dreamworks would turn to a new brick-building company for the sequel. Hasbro and LEGO collide for the first time officially and it&rsquo;s a very quirky Theme. I&rsquo;m not interested enough in getting all the sets, but I was intrigued enough to purchase a few of them and this was my first choice because of the interesting use of Rollercoaster tracks in the main build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A musical instrument inspired design with some interesting looking ideas, this theme&rsquo;s packaging showcases the sets very nicely. I&rsquo;m not sure what else to say, the box is really well designed and is pretty cute looking, it&rsquo;s like LEGO Friends and LEGO Star Wars had some kind of strange combination theme box baby with nice dark purples and some very colorful rainbows on the back where you see all of the features of the set and its gimmicks. A highly impressive design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is bound thickly and showcases all of the builds very effectively. You&rsquo;ll also find cross promotional images of the entire wave. There&rsquo;s also some imagery of MOC creations from fan builders in the back which is very neat and might inspire folks.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Musical notes, large felt parts, roller coaster rails and many more elements are included in this set in unique colours. Some gears, some stickers, this entire set is loaded with parts that are unique and highly useful for fans of rare colours.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Barb: The primary antagonist of the sequel, this Minifigure uses short dual-molded legs in lavender and white with a torso featuring a shiny looking outfit printed on her dual-sided torso. Love the sparkly detail. Her unique sculpted head is limited, with a single stud on top to attach LEGO objects. Her accessory is a guitar of some type, a sticker on a triangle with clip sign attached to a red lightsaber blade. Very impressive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Branch: One of the two main protagonists, Branch here appears to be suffering from some type of mind control. He has a dull facial expression on his uniquely sculpted head piece and a tattoo printed on his chest. There&rsquo;s limited use for his parts, since his hair and head are much larger than standard Minifigures, but he looks decent enough. His main issue is that his hair is hollow, to stash something inside, unfortunately there&rsquo;s no studs so they fall out. I think he hid a cupcake of some type in there.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Poppy: Compared to her design in the Polybag I picked up, this Minifigure is more &lsquo;Rock&rsquo; centered with a pierced nose and a torn up leather jacket of some type on. Much like Branch though she has red glassy eyes seeming to indicate she&rsquo;s under some sort of mind control. She includes a pink rock guitar as an accessory. An interesting looking figure and a nice variant if you&rsquo;re interested in collecting this Theme. And she includes a new unique skirt piece which is a nice addition.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 1: Barb, Branch and Poppy leap into action to build the stage, which is a relatively minimalistic build in this first stage. There&rsquo;s also a little drum set for Branch. Nothing too tricky here, but there will be a gear feature that you should pay close attention to in order to avoid any difficult problems.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 2: The second portion of the build includes the strange bat-like creature and the central tower and roller coaster track design of the stage. This build is fairly straight forward without any difficult or tricky problems. Nothing stands out too badly, it should be noted the felt-like pieces are part of this build, so keep them handy.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Bag 3: Two side builds and a small stand-alone stage are built with this final section of the build as well as two more brick-built characters representing members of the band. I don&rsquo;t know what they are called as I have never seen the film, but they are fairly symmetrical in their builds which makes things repetitive slightly for them.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Stage: The finished model is highly impressive, the look of it is really what interested me in this particular set. It includes some moving parts and alternative options for displays. There are two stand-alone parts left off the model, Branch&rsquo;s drum kit and Barb&rsquo;s showcase reveal stage.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">There&rsquo;s a lot of impressive looking details, the strange felt parts on the top almost look like ears with a dangerous creature built up with tiles on the top of the stage and magma flowing from the mouth to the bottom of the stage. You can turn the gears to make the two singers move, two fold out pieces reveal some backstage details with dressing room and eating area, but when you turn them around to form the stage you can find two creatures built out of bricks with speakers on their heads, probably for blaring the music.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I never saw these movies, I just found the LEGO set here interesting, but honestly I couldn&rsquo;t point out some of the on-screen touches from the movie. I may someday watch this movie, then I might know more. I feel it may have been better if they included somewhere for the drum kit and Barb&rsquo;s stage to fit.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is not going to be for everybody. I mostly purchased it because I found it to be a pretty clever and unique looking design. I felt it would make a decent addition to my display and as such it has not disappointed. I don&rsquo;t know enough about the source material, but I do think the Minifigures are pretty clever too. Overall I&rsquo;d recommend this for the fans, MOC builders may want it for the parts, but if this theme doesn&rsquo;t interest you I&rsquo;d say it&rsquo;s safe to skip it. Recommended for Fans.</p>
