<p>The set: Well I really like it. The minions are cool and the details (i.e. the toilet) really fun. And of course, my son could play with it afterward.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><u>What I liked about</u></b></p>

<p>- The plane and the pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>- Easy to build and the plane is sturdy. Difficult to misplace pieces</p>

<p><b><u>What I thought could be better</u></b></p>

<p>- Some more minion pieces or parts for the aircraft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a cool set. Good fun. I think this is suitable for any child who likes planes.&nbsp;</p>
