"sudorum","2008-11-01T19:53:02.873Z","Great jungle addition.","This is a great set to buy with the other amazon adventure sets and looks just like an ancient monkey temple would look in a rain forest. These early adventure sets are like pre-requisits to the now famous Indiana Jones sets, with the minifigure Johnny Thunder being Indie himself. The set includes a cool transport ship with a monkey cave guarding a golden tablet that's guarded by an interesting axe trap. The trap works by pulling out a ruby on a lever that supports the axe frame that when removed will cause the axes to fall on the foolish victim. Great minifigures, including a rare monkey minifigure.

"AETerry","2010-11-27T02:39:38.913Z","River Expedition Review","<p>This was quiet a fun little set when it came out. This set, like many from the Adventurers theme were definently reminicent of India Jones and this set certainly had me thinking of the first movie.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't care too much for the River boat. I could have forgone it and have just a smaller set with the ruins or a more elaborate Ruin Set that Jonny Thunder and Crew are exploring. There's lot of little details and minifigures to give depth and added play with this set. One of the few sets I know of that has an Aztec type minifigure included.</p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,4
"clundsberg","2011-04-29T22:16:19.52Z","Achu!  Gesundheit!","<p>An amazing set especially for those that clamoured for pre-Indiana Jones adventures.</p>
<p>This set was packed with 7 characters and probablly one of the earliest points where Lego has actual character names for them.&nbsp; I'm particularly fond of the shaman's name&nbsp;(Achu!) The characters all came with plenty of accessories (cameras, spears, cape, backpacks, guns, working magnifying glass) and thrown into the mix were also snakes, a scorpion, a spider, a bird&nbsp;and a monkey!</p>
<p>The land portion of this set&nbsp;consisted of&nbsp;a pier, a very sturdy palmtree (one of the few that I have that is molded and not so much pieced together like the desert adventure sets)&nbsp;and the&nbsp;gorilla-like rock structure which housed Achu! and the gold plated...er...plate.&nbsp; The easily accessible (huge mouth entrance and open in back) Gorilla structure not only looked very natural&nbsp;as scenery, but was a great fort for the characters. Outside was a booby-trap that would activate upon the taking of the ruby lego attached to it.</p>
<p>My favourite part of this set was the old steam boat which looks to be something out of an old Bogart film.&nbsp; This is one of the few Lego sets I did not dismantle for storage.&nbsp; The upper deck (stearing)&nbsp;is removeable in order to access the room below which is the research area for our lego heros as well as storage for the aforementioned mass quantities of accessories.&nbsp; The boat&nbsp;does not float nor was it meant to.</p>
<p>This entire set was a lot of fun to build as it was fairly unique for its time (and still is).&nbsp; I enjoy that it is a very earthy looking set and was great for building both characters and animals (for lack of a better all-encompassing term)&nbsp; Great for play and a good model just to look at: If you find this one on ebay or for sale somewhere&nbsp;it's highly worth considering.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Planetsbend","2010-11-17T18:21:48.453Z","One word - AMAZING","<p><span class=""Apple-tab-span"" style=""white-space:pre"">	</span>At the time, this set was one of many that I eyed when I was a child. And one night that dream came true. The building experience is quite easy and the pieces hold amazingly even now, 10 years later. I love the details on the chief's hat and the amount of playtime this gives. Great set, wish they could make more like this.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Daaryl","2011-04-06T20:18:07.413Z","River Expedition ","<p>I first got this set for my birthday when it came out, and it was my favorite set by far at the time.&nbsp; I really like the ""indiana jones"" themed legos, and this is the best example of the theme.&nbsp; The boat included&nbsp;is rather simplistic, but I feel the simplicity makes it&nbsp;part of a true adventure set.&nbsp; There is a treasure inside of the ruins, and even though there aren't any traps guarding the treasure, it is pretty cool to play with if you have tribal warrior minifigures.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Sadly, the set wasn't stored well and I lost half of the pieces.&nbsp; However, after ""bargain hunting"" on ebay, I was very excited to find this complete set at a $14 dollar bid with a couple of minutes left.&nbsp; I managed to get this set for around $22, and after assembling it again I can say that it is still my favorite set.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-16T07:28:28.513Z","LEGO Adventurers (Jungle) - River Expedition Review","I don't remember it exactly but I think I got this set for Christmas a long time ago. It's a fun build and it has some cool play features and a monkey. The boat looks very nice and the platform, where you can see the engine with the chimney on the back and the steering wheel on the front, can be removed. The ship won't float on water as well. The tomb looks very cool and we also get a skeleton between the axes which can fall down if the bad guys want to steal the gem. In the inside of this tomb you can also find a golden plate. It's a great set to have and I can't complain much about it. We also don't get any stickers to worry about.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
