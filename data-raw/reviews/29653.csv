(it is very cute)","<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;This is a nice brickhead which represents a sheep with a paintbrush (probably painting Easter eggs). The 1x1 studs and tiles can be boring to put on but when the model is completely it was definitely worth the time as it adds so much detail and texture to the build. Random orange studs appear throughout the build to represent paint; this gives the build character as it shows that this sheep may be a little messy.</p>

<p><strong>Nice/ interesting pieces:</strong></p>

<p>It is nice to get the paintbrush piece in this set (And a spare!) as I have never got it and it is such a nice accessory</p>

<p>Uni-kitty&#39;s tail in plain white is used perfectly in this set on the head of the sheep but it definitely fits with the build</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The stand has a flower, a paint bucket and 2 Easter eggs which adds a small environment to the main build, these bits can be removed if you wanted with some easy modification that just leaves a black stande behind.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, congratulations to Lego for reaching 100 brickheads and I recommend getting this if you&#39;re into collecting brickheads as it is a nice addition to anyone&#39;s collection.&nbsp;</p>
