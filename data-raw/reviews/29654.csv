I haven&rsquo;t discussed one in a while, but I have to admit I haven&rsquo;t been buying them up a ton of them lately either, perhaps because the Theme has slowed down a little. This was a must have set though because of the design and my strong affinity towards felines. I really like cats.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is in a similarly designed box to the special Chinese inspired sets, with a rich red sun motif and some kanji written in the background. At least I hope that&rsquo;s Kanji, I admittedly do not recognize languages very well. This is #96 from the BrickHeadz line. Sheep and Bear cross-promotional images are found on the back. Really nice and simple design.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual, as always, is folded and makes everything during the build complicated when you are working on this model. In the back they show the Valentine&rsquo;s Bear and Easter Sheep BrickHeadz that also came out this same year. The build steps are perfectly executed, easy to follow along with and have no tricky steps.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set includes some red tiles and pearl gold tiles which is interesting, it also has the standard 2x2 Headlight bricks from BrickHeadz sets. It&rsquo;s a decent selection of parts. You&rsquo;ll find a printed 1x2 tile as well with some writing on it in Chinese.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is constructed like most BrickHeadz, but it features a unique function for one of the arms. Overall though this is a fairly satisfying build in creating the iconic looking Lucky Cat, the extension for the stand is also an interesting idea which includes some nice detailing when completed.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Lucky Cat looks great, it features a lever in the back that allows you to simulate a waving left paw. Everything here is highly detailed with additional display features and the whiskers and little pink nose on the face are quite cute, love the work behind all of this build. The ears stand out to me well as a very clever use of parts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As with most BrickHeadz sets the fun is in building and collecting them. This particular model however features a unique element, moving parts to simulate the functions of a Lucky Cat. As a fan of BrickHeadz I&rsquo;d say these are pretty fun to collect, but they aren&rsquo;t for everybody. They make decent parts packs though and the unique printed tile is a very nice addition. I would recommend this set.</p>

"AETerry","2022-05-18T04:00:46.12Z","Lucky Cat","<p>I&#39;ll be honest, the aesthetics of the Brickheadz theme isn&#39;t something overall that I prefer. I made an exception for the Lucky Cat as that fits into my love of mythology, and folklore, and wanting something fun and easy to set out for the Chinese New Year. Granted that&#39;s the Lunar New Year as the Lucky Cat or Maneki-Neko is Japanese.<br />
<br />
It&#39;s a fairly standard build and looks just like a brick version of a Lucky Cat. Plus it&#39;s small enough to set somewhere for display during the Lunar New Year.<br />
