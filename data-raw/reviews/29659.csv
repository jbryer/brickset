<p>The Olaf keyring is a fun one and is my first personal experience with the new variant of the character released last year .</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>The Minifigure has the standard mould for Olafs head , an orange unicorn horn for his carrot nose and the moulded torso and legs with printing and Minidoll arms in redish brown .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a nice keyring and I have no complaints it is just good so I recommend it .</p>
