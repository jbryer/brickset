"A_Brickset_user","2003-07-06T00:00:00Z","","This set is great! lots of detail, and lots of fun. The tall tower with the hieroglyphics on it falls over, to reveal four coins. As you can see, the front of the sphinx comes flying out, it does so because a lever pushes the mummy's throne forward, which bumps the loose wall. Lots of tools, and all four of the maps Jason mentioned. The part of the baseplate in front of the sphinx is ""digupable"", and has goblets, skeleton limbs, snakes, scorpions, jewels, coins... Wait! Sorry, I added those, I can't remember what was there originaly and what I added. I THINK it originaly had a snake, map, and a few coins. This set is designed very well.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-10-13T00:00:00Z","","This is probably my favorite of the desert adventure sets.  I love the baseplate and the obolisks.  The statue of Anubis is neat and the sphynx OK.  The set offers a lot of play with the variety of minifigs, the jeep, lots of tools, and the tent.  The tent is flismy but OK.  I particularly like the hidden areas within the baseplate and the entire look of the set is nice.  A lot of fun for those Egyptian adventures.      ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-06-08T13:12:01Z","Desert Adventurers rule!","I loved the adventurers in egypt sets so much tat I bought every single one of them! This one was so good because of the great &quot;BURP&quot;, the mummy, the car, the sphinx, and especially all the minifigures. My only complaint is the flimsy tent, but that dosnt matter to much. You can take the parts of the &quot;BURP&quot; and make it all &quot;collapse&quot;.
  You also get ALL the maps!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"smiley905","2007-12-31T00:35:59.403Z","pretty good","this is a good set and im glad i got it, it has lots of little things so im going to list them

tent- the tent is made af fabrick attached to a lego brick bace, it has a door an mf can fit inside it, 5\5

camp fire- it has side ways flames which look dumb, and the pot is stuck on it very slopily, it does include some cool pieces but its not that great 2\5

car- this car is good and serves its purpose well, it has a cool engine but other than that, lacks some dtail 4.5 \ 5

main sphynx and base- the sphynx is cool and very detailed, if you flick a switch, the mummy shoots out, the piramids are good, the taller one tips over to reveal a hiding spot and the both contain printed bricks. the palm tree is cool, and the jackle is alright. the base has hidden compartments under the grey in the front, and under the sphinx at the back, (its also the based used on the first ogle base) 4\5

i like this set and would recomend it to about anyone

The one thing I like about this set is that this set has all four maps; the other three only have one map.  It has all the characters (except Harry Caine) and has a landscape with lots of traps and enemies.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Luke_Skytalker","2008-03-01T00:19:47.39Z","Got it as a Secret Surprise!","I remember vaguely in my memory the day that I obtained this set. It was Christmas day, and I was at my uncle's house a few years ago. I remember this because they had some quite hairy carpet and as I was annoyed to discover that I could not drive the small car along the floor because the wheels got stuck in the hair. I was very young then and I don't even think I made the set, as I am also quite annoyed over the discovery that I had lost the minifigure's hook for hand. They were really the only disappointments about the set.

After flicking through the tattered instruction booklet I thought that it was a nice design but lego kind of cheated because they made a customised raised baseplate to tailor the needs of the set. I still have the tent and have only attempted to make it once, and looking through my peice collection I lost the motivation. I never had seen anything like it before though, it is just a fabric material stuck to small peices of lego.

The car however, I remember I had kept fully built for a few years. There are very nice pieces in there, quite large and detailed. I like the front engine, it is made up of a poseable pivot peice and set in a horizontal position with oldgrey lego suds on them. The piece in front of it I have seen a few times before, it is another tailored piece, this time an old engine front. it has a classic radiator and old fashoined headlights.
The minifigures can sit in it nicely as long as their arms don't get in the way of each other. There is also a small slot for weapons (which I have not lost either) to sit in and a crate like boot in the back.

The Egyptian patterns on the side of the slabs of ancient Egyptian tan material are random in the sense that lego probably had no idea what they were saying on them. The tree is nicely made, it is essentially a poseable palm tree with a few leaf pieces. The raised baseplate doesn't really have much use, but it has a few nooks and crannies to hide things in. The minifig accessories includes a snake, a gun/pistol, a gun/rifle, a pickaxe, a few jewells, a few coins, a coffin, a pharaoh's crown with colour and one without, and lastly a scorpion. Still quite useful objects. The minifigures didn't really do much for me except for the person wearing the suit; I like suits. It goes really well with the cuffs, which go really well with the top hat.

The sphinx seems to be a sturdy structure but I noticed that the dark grey it used is differently coloured to the dark grey used now. The two colours don't seem to be that different but close together it looks horrible if you want to make a symmetrical MOC. The function that allows the ghoul to pop out doesn't really make sense to me, but I have never remember building the sphinx so what do I know? 

My advise is this; if you see this set on sale somewhere, buy it if it is at a low piece-to-price ratio, without using a star wars basis, as star wars prices are too high for what you get. Think of this set as a bonus impulse set, the impulse being all the minifigures and accessories and the coffin and car, and the plus being the rest. Pay what you think it is worth by this reveiw, I would buy it if it were cheap, but just remember you are actually getting a lot out of it.

"Naylus","2011-03-13T17:09:27.553Z","The Sphinx and its riddle...","<p><strong>-Updated-</strong></p>

<p><em>&quot;Which creature goes on four legs in the morning, at mid-day it walks on two, and in the evening upon three...?&quot;</em>&nbsp;&ndash;&nbsp;a sphinx would ask a traveller one day. Well, the Greek sphinx probably asked, but here we have the &quot;creature&quot; from Ancient Egypt.</p>

<p><strong>General Overview</strong><br />
As many sets of the Adventurers series,&nbsp;<em>5978</em>&nbsp;has a preference for sand and beige colors &ndash;quite a novice back in 1990s. A large platform includes the Sphinx itself with two obelisks and Anubis statue nearby. And one palm.</p>

<p>While not very large, this layout includes several secrets and traps: there is a lair of the Pharaoh Mummy Hotep behind the secret door with a precaution tablet on it. A lever on the right allows the Mummy to appear at once. The largest obelisk can fall and crush the robbers, also revealing a hatch. One secret area lies right before the Sphinx&#39;s paws and is suitable to store minor details or scorpions and snakes.</p>

<p>The set also includes a black sarcophagus (reminding of basalt like in the case with real-life&nbsp;sarcophagus of <em>Horkhebit</em>) with a skeleton with a white <em>nemes</em> (Egyptian headgear).</p>

<p>The Archaeologists have their own car in the style of 1910s, as well as a small camp (a tent made of textile) with a bonfire. There are several creatures like snakes and scorpions in this set.</p>

<p><strong>The minifigures</strong><br />
The minifigures remind of&nbsp;British archaeologists, but are somehow close in resemblance to Indiana Jones characters (which would come to Lego several years later). You could divide these into 3 groups, with the 1st one &ndash; the professional archaeologists, searching the truth about ancient history, which includes&nbsp;<strong>Johnny Thunder</strong> (in brown hat), <strong>Dr. Charles Lightning</strong> and <strong>Miss Gail Storm</strong> (the latter two have classic British-like helmets). The have the car with instruments and retro-camera to make a film.</p>

<p>The second group consists of tomb robbers most likely, though their leader is <strong>Baron Von Barron</strong> and his henchman &ndash; <strong>Lord Sam Sinister</strong> in black cylinder (introduced to Lego back in 1970s by the way). Von Barron has a hook instead of his hand and sort of a scar on his face.</p>

<p>Pharaoh <strong>Hotep</strong> and a Skeleton form the third group, which guards the Sphinx from intruders. Both wear <em>nemeses</em>, which I find a very good brick headgear introduced to Lego back then &ndash; and still used like in Collectible Minifigures (e.g. <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8684-16/Pharaoh"">this set</a>&nbsp;or <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7325-1/Cursed-Cobra-Statue"">this one</a>).</p>

<p><strong>Final resume</strong><br />
It wouldn&#39;t be a surprise to compare the whole Adventurers series with <em>Indiana Jones</em> and the <em>Mummy</em> films. All elements are well done and the whole construction is ideal in terms of design. And yes, the Obelisks don&#39;t have any STICKERS. That&#39;s an actual good old print.</p>

<p>In general, this is a very detailed set and is of high playability:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A good platform and collection of details to make various other Egyptian temples, ruins, etc.</li>
	<li>Lot of rare and unusual elements like scorpions, snakes, maps, weapons equipment, etc.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>A lot of small traps &ndash;&nbsp;falling obelisk, secret entrance to the tomb and others.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>A nice set of minifigures of various looks (archaeologists, robbers, the mummy, etc.)</li>
</ul>

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-25T11:33:33.977Z","LEGO Adventurers (Desert) - Sphinx Secret Surprise Review","This is definitely the better version of the sphinx if you have a look at the version we got from the Pharaoh's Quest theme this year. The built of this set is lot's of fun and we also don't get any stickers which you've to worry about. We also get lot's of stuff in there like a jeep, a box with some accessories, a tent, a sarcophagus and a campfire. The jeep is a really nice looking vehicle. On the back we get a box which is the trunk of this car and the windscreen and the engines on the front can sviwel. The cockpit is so big that you can put in two minifigs if you want.<br><br>The main scene of this set is the sphinx itself. This sphinx has a nice baseplate with a pit for the snakes and there's also some gold and a map hidden inside of this pit. There's also a place for the statue and two obelisks. The bigger obelisk has a place where you can hide some gold as well. The coolest play feature of this set is that you can sviwel a lever which pushes the speeder of the mummy out. On the front of this speeder is a little wall with a gem and a warning sign. It's a great set and I can't complain about it. I also can't complain about the number of minifigs we get in this set.<br><br>All
