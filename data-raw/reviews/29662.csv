"Koot","2019-11-08T03:21:09.02Z","Review 853967-1: Wooden Minifigure","<p>I recently purchased&nbsp;the new wooden Minifigure&nbsp;from the LEGO Originals theme, and I&#39;ll cut to the chase here. It&#39;s pretty disappointing - at least for me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, if you&#39;re more of an artistic person who would be interested in painting/other means of decorating it, this may be a more reasonable purchase for you. As I&#39;m not that kind of person, this set serves very little, if any, play value. As well as this, it is not nearly as good of a display piece as a built-up model of the same price range.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I think it might as well be worth mentioning that my instructions manual was very crumpled up inside the box, as it comes with no protective sleeve or anything. Pretty subpar for an expensive set.</p>

<p>I do not recommend this set unless the thought of decorating the figure really sparks your interest. But even if so, it is still so overpriced. Thanks for reading and I hope this helps.&nbsp;</p>

With a love of wood and Lego, I expected a lot more, especially at the price. Didn&#39;t expect it to seem as small and had thought there wood be some movement to the figurine. Personally at the price, a harder more quality wood could have been used for the most classic piece of Lego ever made, the Minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A beautiful novel idea, however value for money and the attention to detail lacking in the inflexibility rigid design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bricks in the set are nothing special, but then again that certainly is not why you would want this piece. How could I not love anything minifig, however expected the crafters to deliver more.&nbsp;</p>
