<p>The Possessed Pizza Delivery Man comes attached to the front of issue 2 of the Hidden Side Comic, available between 6th November and 10th December 2019.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>Unlike other comics the Hidden Side ones have started with the smaller foil bag with a flap.&nbsp; This contains the pieces well, but the glue use to hold the flap down is very strong and can easily catch the pieces as you try to pour them out.</p>

<p>The Possessed Pizza Delivery Man is pictured nicely with his possessed face and he is brandishing his cleaver.&nbsp; The 1:1 image on the back is the printed&nbsp;2x2 tile representing the pizza box.&nbsp; The front indicates that this is for 7+, which seems strange as Collectable Minifigures&nbsp;are 5+ and there is nothing different here - unless the theme is deemed to be older?</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>This set is completely about the Possessed Pizza Delivery Man.&nbsp; He is basically the same as <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-minifig-hs028"">Ronny</a> from the Hidden Side set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70422-1/Shrimp-Shack-Attack"">70422: Shrimp Shack Attack</a>&nbsp;with his <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6275699"">torso</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4162916"">legs</a> being identical to Ronny&#39;s, indeed his torso only appears in this and the Shrimp Shack making it unique to the Hidden Side.&nbsp; His legs are plain Earth Blue and are incredibly common.</p>

<p>What is great with this set is you get two head elements!&nbsp; The possessed head, as you would imagine, currently only appears with Hidden Side and is in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6300199"">three</a> of the sets from the theme.&nbsp; The &quot;standard&quot; head is reasonably common, appearing in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6153335"">15</a> sets including some of the People Packs.&nbsp; The cheapest way to get this is probably through <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60146-1/Stunt-Truck"">60146: Stunt Truck</a>.</p>

<p>He also sports a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6032178/figur-head-clothing-no-6"">red hat</a> which is very common too.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>There is no build here other than the Minifigure.&nbsp; However you do get the printed <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6175184"">2x2 tile</a> for the pizza box and the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6153590"">cleaver</a>.&nbsp; The cleaver only really appears in higher priced sets, so it&#39;s good to see it included here and the 2x2 only appears in five other sets.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>I would say that this is better than Jack from the last issue, however with no direct app use for this Minifigure it is still missing something.&nbsp; It will fit nicely with the Shrimp Shack, and the standard head allows him to be used within any Lego City too.&nbsp; This goes nicely with the Lego Comic set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/951909-1/Pizza-Delivery-Biker"">951909</a> released recently, so it&#39;s a shame that they were not both available at the same time.</p>

<p>This only cost &pound;3.99, which is a fantastic price when you compare it to Collectable Minifigures.</p>

<p>From 11th December 2019 issue three will have Parker with a laptop.&nbsp; She appears to match the one in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70419-1/Wrecked-Shrimp-Boat"">70419: Wrecked Shrimp Boat</a>.</p>
