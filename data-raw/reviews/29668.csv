<p>Is very easy to build and makes great addition for my Lego Capital town.</p>

<h3>The build:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The build is quite straight-forward. There aren&#39;t any too overly complex techniques being used, and I am pretty sure that even the most average builder will have no problem whatsoever putting this set together.&nbsp;<br />
Although there is a lot of repetition (the 5 dragons and temple-arches), the instructions are made in such a way that the building process never becomes to overly boring. For example: the dragons are not all build together&nbsp;and the small differences in their head-design makes sure you have to keep your attention to what you are doing instead of turning to auto-buildpilot :)</p>

<h3>The model:</h3>

<p>Wow! Very nice. The dragons look amazing The temple-archway looks amazing, although it is very thin,&nbsp;there is not a lot af depth present. The stage is superb. The drumband is lovely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The dragons don&#39;t have a lot of articulation, but what is there is sufficient: their heads can move up and down a bit, the lower jaws open&nbsp;up and the legs are posable. It is enough to make sure you can create some sense of movement and some interesting ways to showcase the dragons on their stage.</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>Maybe the best...euhm...part :)<br />
No stickers! Nicely printed pieces, although the white prints still have the old problem of them being not white but showing through the colours underneath.<br />
Many new parts in unusual colours, many gold-coloured pieces, many recolours etc... this is a dream come true for many AFOLS.<br />
I don&#39;t see a lot of value here for MOC-builders for the simple reason that the printed pieces are not generic enough, they are very specific&nbsp;to the eastern theme.</p>

<h3>Overall:</h3>

<p>Good, but not amazing.&nbsp;</p>
