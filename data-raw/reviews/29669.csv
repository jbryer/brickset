It was sold out on day one at my local store and I was lucky enough to get a copy. And it doesn&#39;t disappoint in real life!</p>

<p>Though it&#39;s a sizeable set, the build never feels slow because it&#39;s&nbsp;divided into multiple smaller structures, each of which feels satisfying to complete. There&#39;s not much repetition, and there are some interesting techniques, especially for the roofs. The setting,&nbsp;a big assortment of figures, and numerous props make this set highly playable as well.</p>

<p>If you build your own MOCs, this set is not just a parts pack,&nbsp;it&#39;s more like a Parts Party! The ratio of unusual elements, recolors, and printed tiles is very high and as an AFOL&nbsp;I felt like a kid in a candy store. Highlights include new elements in Teal; three colors of the new 1x1&nbsp;Outside Bow; six colors of Trophy; three colors of Ignot; the red lanterns; and a profusion of Pearl Gold.</p>

<p>To me this set and set 80104 also represent&nbsp;a cultural milestone for LEGO. For&nbsp;decades, architecture in LEGO sets&nbsp;centered&nbsp;on Europe and North America, or caricatured East Asian architecture as in Ninjago. Here for the first time (with the exception of a few Architecture sets for adults) LEGO is taking Chinese historical architecture and tradition&nbsp;seriously, and the result is magnificent. I hope this change is not just for profit in the Asian Pacific market but also a sign that LEGO believes families around the world are ready to engage with each other&#39;s cultures.</p>

<p>Throughout, you can feel how designer Markus Rollb&uuml;hler approached the challenge with enthusiasm and deep appreciation. I can&#39;t recall seeing this much intense attention to detail packed into this number of parts. Congratulations, Markus -- I love these sets and&nbsp;hope they will be inspiring for kids and builders around the world!</p>

It features the same family of minifigures as last year&#39;s Lunar new Year Eve Dinner and a few new minifigures. For the minifigures, I think the designer put a lot of effort into making different and unique minifigures like the barbecue stall guy with the chinese words reading barbecue on the torso. The set includes enough minifigures to make this fair a nice and lively scene. I recommend putting this on a 48x48&nbsp;grey baseplate. The temple features many different and interesting building techniques especially for the sign and the roof. The build was somewhat repetitive for the roof of the temple as you had to place many small pieces in but the est of the build was quite interesting. This set is extremely detailed overall and I think the price for it is reasonable for this many pieces.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
