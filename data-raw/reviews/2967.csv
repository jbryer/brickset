"A_Brickset_user","2003-06-20T00:00:00Z","","I sort of agree with Jason, about the blocky part, but this set is awful lot of fun. You can see most of them, but I will go through the traps. The small red, blue, and yellow statue fallso forward, and reveals gold coins in a box on the other side. The bridge falls towards the river on the end farther from the main temple (Closer to your viewing point.) Spears come sliding through a trap door and will strike anyone attempting to get the ruby between the flames. Finally, a skeleton can be raised and lowered on a chain attached to a lance. (Why, maybe to scare anyone who gets past the spider web into the bare, bottom middle of the main temple section. I don't know!) The chain is wound around the lance, and is held from falling by a plate on one of those 1x1x2 turndown/flip two piece bricks, which you of course flip to release. I shifted a few things, and rigged the palm tree to fall, spilling a brown cannon ball (or two if I manage to balance two, which is rare) that is supposed to be a coconut. On to the palm tree. The trunk is all one piece, instead of five or six. The leaves are all on piece too. The boat has quite alot of extra space, and can fit both Senor Palamar (Man in white suit and Western hat) and Rudo Villano (the man in gray who does not come in this set, but is an associate of Senor Palamar, and comes in other Amazon sets) as well as Gabarro, the pilot of the boat. Quite a few odd but nice looking decorations in this set. The fact that there are no stairs means more hiking for everyone to get to the top of the raised baseplate. Achu, the Amazonian (Aztec?Maya? Inca?) priest is a very nice and detailed minifig. Another palm tree might be a nice addition to this. The car is not very good, and has different tire sizes. Six skulls including those of the two skelletons are included. Achu has a nice little observation platform on the far left part of the main temple, as well as his pedestal thing on top of the temple.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

The minifigs included are Johnny Thunder, the star of the advenure series, Senior Palomar, Dr. Kilroy, Rudo Villano, the sailor Gabarros, and Achu, the Amazonian lord. The traps are great, including a bridge that falls when you pull out a lever pole, a spear mechanism that drops, a falling skeleton, and the coup de grace: a falling platform that throws a minifigure in a pit, revealing a hidden stash of coins. Your money will be used well on this set if you can get your paws on it.",FALSE,5,5,5,5,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-08T09:59:21.457Z","LEGO Adventurers (Jungle) - Amazon Ancient Ruins Review","This set is definitely a must have if you're a LEGO collector. It has lot's of valuable pieces and some awsome play features. It also has a nice boat and a jeep which has two seats. We also get a campfire on the front of this temple. On the other side you get a place where you can hide some gold. The next play feature is that the bridge can fall into the river if you move the lever. After crossing the bridge you'll see a spiderweb. On each side of the temple is a place with a gem. One side has a little trap which you can use to kill the bad guys: On the balcony is a place with two spears which you can fall into the ground if you move the lever.<br><br>What I think is also unique about this set is that there're lot's of printed pieces. In fact: This set has no stickers. On the top of the middle is also a place where you can see a skeleton hanging around. If you move the lever you can drop him and scare the bad guys. On the top of the temple you can also see a throne. I think it's a cool set to have and I also can't complain about the number of minifigs we get here. As I told you in the beginning: This set is a MUST HAVE!<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Jason_LEGO","2010-06-15T14:54:21.733Z","Great Addition to any Collection","I recently&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;this complete set, instructions and original box in excellent condition! Very nice presentation with the packaging and instructions. This set has no pesky stickers to peel off. All special bricks are printed where needed. This is always a huge bonus. Most of these printed pieces are also very rare. The baseplate is great too, lots of possibilities for building many cool scenes. There is an abundance of great minifigs. There are cool traps and moving parts. The overall look and feel of the set is quite good. The build process was a bit tedious, but rewarding when done. I cannot stress how many special pieces there are in this set that make it truly unique. The set is quite big, but mainly because the baseplate that you start with is so large. There could have been a bit more detail in certain areas, maybe some stairs up the ruins. The scale of the boat is a bit large for this set, a smaller boat would have fit in a little nicer. The throne at the top is a little weak, but it gets the idea across. As a whole the set looks great, with some minor adjustments it could be perfect.<div><br></div><div>To&nbsp;summarize:</div><div><br></div><div><ul><li><h4>Pros:</h4></li><li>Many unique printed pieces</li><li>Great playability</li><li>Large unique baseplate</li><li>Lots of good minifigs</li><li>Moving parts and traps</li><li>Great&nbsp;overall&nbsp;look to the set</li></ul><div><br></div></div><div><ul><li><h4>Cons:</h4></li><li><div>Some scale issues with the boat and throne</div><div>Lacks stairs in the ruins</div><div><br></div></li></ul></div><div>If you can find this set at a reasonable price I would recommend it.</div><div><br></div>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"LegoCollector125","2011-06-04T06:35:25.413Z","Journey into the Amazon","<p>This set was my first Adventurers set, and one I have always enjoyed. It has a great parts selection, great minifigures, and it is a fairly large set. </p>
<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>This set has an awesome parts selection, including:</p>
<p>Jungle baseplate, rope bridge, printed&nbsp;Amazon pieces, the Sun Disc, car pieces, an old-fashioned movie camera, crocodile, boat and lots of other printed pieces and minifigure accessories. Also includes several animals besides the crocodile.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The minifigures in this set are also great, they include:</p>
<p><strong>Achu</strong>-Nice printed headpiece, cape, and overall a great figure. </p>
<p>Accessories: Sun Disc, Chrome Dagger</p>
<p><strong>Johnny Thunder</strong>-Nothing is different about Johnny than in the Desert Subtheme, but he's still cool.</p>
<p>Accessories: Chrome Dagger, Map</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Kilroy</strong>-Again, nothing different than in the Desert Subtheme, but he still has a pith helmet and a cool backpack.</p>
<p>Accessories: Backpack, Pickaxe, Magnifying Glass</p>
<p><strong>Gabarros</strong>-Nice figure, nothing really special about him</p>
<p>Accessories: Red coffee cup</p>
<p><strong>Senor Palomar</strong>-Also a cool figure, I like the printed White-suited chest and the white cowboy hat. </p>
<p>Accessories: Pistol, Binoculars</p>
<p><strong>Pippin Reed</strong>-Not a bad figure, again, I like the pith helmet.</p>
<p>Accessories: Sword</p>
<p>Also includes 2 skeletons,&nbsp;one of which is used in a trap, the other just lays next to one of the rubies. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build is fun, although the set looks far bigger than it actually is. With only 450 pieces, the set makes use of the baseplate and other large pieces to look much larger. </p>
<h4>The completed model</h4>
<p>The finished set looks great, and has many features for great playability. </p>
<p><strong>Traps/Playability Features</strong></p>
<p>There is a statue at the front which drops the victim into a pit, the rope bridge collapses into the river, spears fall from one tower, and a skeleton drops from the ceiling in the main tower. </p>
<p><strong>Main Tower</strong></p>
<p>The center tower is the most detailed, with 3 levels. The first has a spider web covering the doorway. The interior is taken up by a skeleton that falls from the ceiling. The top level is Achu's throne. I find the throne a bit small, as there is no place to put the Sun Disc, or even for the Adventurers to stand once they reach the top. </p>
<p><strong>Smaller Towers</strong></p>
<p>The set includes 2 smaller towers, both of which have a ruby on a pedestal on the bottom level. The first has a room with another ruby, a small table, and Achu's feathered spear. The second contains a trap that drops spears onto unsuspecting victims. </p>
<p><strong>Baseplate, bridge, campsite</strong></p>
<p>The baseplate also has the Adventurers' campsite, a small statue, and the rope bridge on it. The campsite is nice, and it does have some cool accessories, but overall is nothing special. The statue is cool, as it can drop the victims into a pit, thus unveiling a secret treasure. Finally, the bridge. The rope bridge can collapse, dropping it's unsuspecting victim into the water, where a crocodile and Gabarros' boat are waiting. </p>
<h4>Overall</h4>
<p>Overall, I think this set in a great addition to any collection, and I highly recommend it to anyone, especially an Adventurers fan. It is very playable, has great parts and figures, and is an overall great set. </p>

"Classic_Brick_Studios","2021-10-08T09:26:06.967Z","Deep down in South Americas rainforest...","<p><em>The Amazon River lies quietly in the evening sun over the rainforest and the last ray of sunshine hits through the trees, revealing the ancient ruins of a long-lost civilisation. It is here, in this almost paradisiacal scenery, where the second adventure of Johnny Thunder finds is final standoff. After weeks of enduring snakes, spiders and deadly traps, our team of brave explorers has finally found the homestead of the mythical sundisk. Unfortunately for them, they are not the only ones who made their way through the jungle. Se&ntilde;or Palomar is on the adventurers trail and will stop at nothing to get the treasure he desires. Who will win this race to the treasure and will Achu give it up willingly? We are about to find out...</em></p>

<p>This is the third of the &quot;big guys&quot; I review for the Adventurers series. I have said it time and time again, I love this theme, and it might quite possibly be my favourite theme ever, only rivalled by Pirates, Castle and Western. We are heading into the jungle and take a look at the rarest set of the Adventurers. The year is 1999, LEGO is in bad shape and throws everything at the wall, in the hopes, something would stick. The jungle wave of the adventurers came out in a time of great change and was quickly replaced by the third instalment, because LEGO found out, kids like dinosaurs (shocking, I know). So unfortunately the second wave of adventurers sets was cut short and has become really rare ever since. Look up on eBay even the smaller sets and you&#39;ll see what I mean.</p>

<p>I had my eye out on this set for quite some time, 2.5 years to be exact and regularly checked on eBay and Bricklink to get my hands on one. However, I was not willing to pay 300-400 Euros for it. Also, most offerings are in northern America or Canada. Finally, I found one in my country and ended up paying 130 Euros for it. I&#39;m usually not talking about what I played too much in reviews, but here I feel like it is important when I discuss the price later on. But let&#39;s first take a look at the Amazon Ancient Ruins...</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>We get 8 Minifigures, two of which are skeletons. Included are: Johnny Thunder, Gail Storm, Dr. Charles Lightning, Se&ntilde;or Palomar, Gabarros and the amazing Achu. The set sadly does not include Harry Cane and Rudo Villano, who would&#39;ve made it feel more complete I think.</p>

<p>However, let&#39;s take a moment to appreciate how much detail LEGO put into Achu&#39;s design. I love this figure, it is so colourful and all adds up perfectly together to form one of the best figures LEGO has ever released.</p>

<p><strong>The vehicles</strong></p>

<p>As is the case with most Adventurers sets, we get vehicles to round out the scene. Included in this set are a car and a little steamboat. The car is pretty standard buildwise, but includes some awesome aggressive-looking thick tires on the back wheels. It also uses set exclusive tan axle pieces.</p>

<p>The boat isn&#39;t necessarily my favourite design out there, but does the job well. I like it and my set is unfortunately still missing the exclusive brown hull. One day I&#39;ll get that piece, but I&#39;m not willing to pay 50 dollars for it right now.</p>

<p><strong>The Ancient Ruins</strong></p>

<p>Now let&#39;s get into the meat and potatoes and man, what a set this is! I love the colourful design, it fits Achu very well. The architecture seems to mix Aztec and Amazon cultural elements and come to think of it, looks a bit like the temple of Akator.</p>

<p>But let&#39;s start at the bottom. We have the amazing baseplate, which must be one of my favourite designs, with a beautiful river print going down the middle. Before we can enter the temple we need to rest at the camp, set up by our Adventurers, in front of the temple. Here we also find a palm tree as well as our first booby trap. A small shrine that can tumble into a pit, burring an unsuspecting treasure hunter. From there a rope bridge leads over the raging river below. It obviously can also be loosened up a little, which reminds me of the bridge scene in Temple of Doom.</p>

<p>So now we are inside of Achu&#39;s Amazon Ancient Ruins and the first thing that greets us is probably the most gruesome thing in the Adventurers series. There is a hanged skeleton, yes a hanged skeleton, that can be thrown down the entrance to scare away Johnny and his friends. On the left and right there are rubies to steal, though one of them will make for an impaling experience.</p>

<p>The temple also has many exclusive or rare printed elements, which give it just the right look. One thing I do have to criticise though is the use of the baseplate. I love these 3D-plates, but here it is integrated in a way that makes it really uncomfortable and downright scary to pick this set up, since the plate isn&#39;t really supported in the middle, on its weakest part. I always worry about that plate breaking whenever I move the set around.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Even though not quite as good as its predecessor the Pharao&#39;s Forbidden Ruins, this set is amazing. I am so happy to own one, and it will probably never leave the display shelve ever again. It comes with its flaws, but these are minor in my opinion and for the price of 80 Dollars back then, this was an awesome set, even adjusted for inflation nowadays. Even the 130 Euros I played for it, were absolutely worth it. You get traps, heroes, villains, vehicles and a perfect ready-made adventure.</p>

<p>However, due to its rarity nowadays the set has become rather expensive, and I really can&#39;t recommend it for anything over 200 dollars if you really really want it.</p>

<p>I hope you enjoyed this review, I certainly had fun writing it and can&#39;t tell you, how happy I am to have finally added this set to my collection!</p>
