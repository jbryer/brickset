<p>We only stayed away from Space for one issue of the Lego Comic, but Nils Legstrong now has Captain Tom to keep him from going crazy.&nbsp; Issue 21 comes with just the one set attached to the front cover, but what an addition!&nbsp; This particular comic was available in the UK between 20th November&nbsp;and 17th December 2019.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The parts come inside the larger foil packet that is glued shut.&nbsp; I like the space background and small rocks that the buggy is kicking up.&nbsp; Captain Tom looks very happy as he drives along.&nbsp; The front of the packet says it&#39;s for anyone 6 and above, but as ever the build is simple enough for younger builders.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Captain Tom appears in only one other set, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60228-1/Deep-Space-Rocket-and-Launch-Control"">60228</a>, which is priced at &pound;89.99 so it&#39;s great to see him here in a much cheaper set.&nbsp; There is printing on the front and back of the Bright Orange torso which is new for 2019 and appears in seven of the Space sets.&nbsp; The legs only have printing on the front and again appear&nbsp;in seven of the 2019 sets.&nbsp; The legs are Bright Orange and the belt is White.&nbsp; This contrast works really well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The head is printed on both sides, with both conveying a happy Captain.&nbsp; This head element has only appeared in the Outdoor Adventures people pack before the two space sets, so is quite rare and this set is by far the cheapest way to obtain one.&nbsp; The visor first appeared in a Batman set in 2017, but the helmet is new for 2019 I believe.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>Along with the Captain you get a space buggy made from 13 elements.&nbsp; None of these jump out at me as especially rare and could probably be built from a lot of collections.&nbsp; However, that is not to say it is bad.&nbsp; Maybe a clip to hold a couple of space tools, and the tools could have added to the set.&nbsp; The previous space set had a camera and rock, so some method of extracting the rock would have increased the play value for someone who has both.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>Certainly worth getting, especially if you had the set from Issue 19.&nbsp; The price of the comic was &pound;4.25 in the UK, which is great value.&nbsp; If you missed out then I suggest keeping an eye out for future comics as you do tend to get older sets attached at some point.&nbsp; I expect the Lego City Comic to visit space again at some point in 2020, and we might get a Female astronaut with that one.</p>

<p>The next comic comes with a lumberjack, chainsaw and log.</p>
