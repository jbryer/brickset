"indykid","2020-06-18T00:07:21.84Z","Neat Little Set","<p>Bought this on a whim at Walgreens since I love Keri Russell on The Americans and am content knowing that this is the closest I&#39;ll ever get to an Elizabeth Jennings minifig.</p>

<p>This was a fun little build to pass the afternoon when I was waiting for a larger set to show up in the mail. Super easy and straightforward, great for little kids. More of a playset than a display piece since the Y wing is so small and has no cover for the cockpit. The flick action torpedoes are surprisingly effective. The handguns are also cool and there&#39;s a third one in the small pile of extra pieces left over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minor bummer that the minifig has an all black head instead of a printed face but I guess you never see her face in the movie so it&#39;s not a big deal. When she&#39;s sitting in the cockpit her arms point up at an awkward angle due to the 1x1 slope pieces for the windshield.&nbsp;The pieces are nothing special or rare beyond the minifig and blasters. In my opinion a little pricey considering how tiny it is--something like $7 would be more reasonable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good stocking stuffer or supplement to a larger set if anyone is a LEGO Star Wars fan.</p>

<p>Model</p>

<p>This craft is a quiescence of what you can call &quot;Chibi&quot;. It is designed very well to fit this category. Its &quot;head&quot; is shortened a bit, but still looks great, and mimics the original one perfectly. Guns made of flick-fire missiles works good. Windscreen is traditionally made of two cheese slopes in trans black. Canopy can fit in one minifig, unfortunately without any control or steering panels.</p>

<p>Middle section is done great. It has some subtle details, which is always great addition. There is less of them than on a big version, and they are practically the same as on the previous version. Rotating turret is a great feature, which wasn&#39;t seen before. It is simple, yet adds a lot to the look of this craft. Flick-fire missiles are well integrated into the model and don&#39;t bother much. Yet it isn&#39;t easy to get rid of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Engines are designed good. They are quite simple, yet use some nice building techniques. I like especially the usage of missiles again. They look much sleeker than telescope&nbsp;used before.&nbsp;Reverse dome (I think it&#39;s called &quot;bowl&quot;) is a great addition. I love the single red stripe on the engine. Also red on canopy looks great.</p>

<p>Model is very sturdy, yet, just like the rest of microfighters, it has not many playable functions beside ability to fly around.</p>

<p>Minifig</p>

<p>There is one minifig. Her name is Zorii Bliss, and she is one of the secondary characters in Rise of Skywalker.</p>

<p>She looks great in her minifig form. She wears dark red robe with many golden additions. Her belt has a great pattern too. On her legs there are two printed holsters. On her backs there is a subtle print of her collar and belt.</p>

<p>She is wearing also a gold-and-black helmet which looks great. It has nice sci-fi vibe, and there are many possible ways to incorporate it to some futuristic model. Unfortunately underneath there is a plain black face. As her weapon, she uses a pair of gun metal gray flintlock pistols.</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>Even though there is quite a few of them (round 80) there are some, that are really useful. There are four 2x2 round bricks with a hole, two of those &quot;bowl&quot; I mention before and some bricks with studs on side. Also, there are twelve (!) flick-fire missiles. Overall, quite good.</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>It is a quite good set, which has a great fig, and look very well. I this it&#39;s worth recommending.</p>

"JayTheNinja19","2020-11-18T07:21:02.263Z","Resistance Y-Wing Microfighter. A good-looking build, with some faults","<p>When I watched Star Wars: The&nbsp;Rise of Skywalker, I wasn&#39;t pleased with the film, but I quite liked the set selection for the film. Sets I particularly liked were the Microfighters that accompanied&nbsp;the film. Both offer prominent characters with nice builds, but for today I&#39;m just looking at the Resistance Y-Wing that Zorii Bliss flies.</p>

<h3><strong>The Build</strong></h3>

<p>This Y-wing is in my mind one of the better Microfighters released in the past couple of years, at least in terms of detail. The design manages to look quite realistic while using pretty common pieces. The wings look pretty good, and help bring some texture into the build. The cockpit is quite well-designed, with some clever part uses to create the cannon. The rest of the ship looks good, again featuring some nice texture and part uses to give this thing some life. Aside from that, there&#39;s not really much to say about the&nbsp;build. This Y-wing comes with flick missile projectiles, which are my personal&nbsp;least-favourite shooting function. While I understand that the nature of Microfighters is&nbsp;quite blocky, I feel that this design is just a touch too heavy, and it just doesn&#39;t complement the style of the vehicle. That being said, it would be very difficult to make it lighter due to the already-low number of pieces, and this complaint of mine is just to&nbsp;provide some balance.&nbsp;Overall, it&#39;s a good design, with some nice detail. I think that it&#39;s faults are minimal, and 8.5/10 is a fair score.</p>

<h3><strong>The Minifigure</strong></h3>

<p>I&#39;m not gonna lie, I don&#39;t like Zorii Bliss at all. But I&#39;m&nbsp;here to discuss the Minifig, not the in-universe character, and I must say that this design is pretty top-notch. The torso and leg printing is good, and really captures the look of the character. There&#39;s no side printing but honestly I think she looks interesting enough without it. Her helmet looks good, and the quality of it is pretty high. Underneath, her face is just a black Minifig head, presumably because LEGO didn&#39;t want to reveal her identity before it was known to the public. Honestly I think it was unnecessary as her character was pretty minor, and she&#39;s clearly female, so what harm would it have done to give her a normal face? I do acknowledge that little is seen of her face in the film, so maybe it was also due to that. She wields twin pistols, which both look good. Perhaps a little large compared to those wielded in the film, but they look nice. Again, I aim to nit-pick a little just to show that there are some minor faults&nbsp;to bring some balance to my opinion. I dislike the character, but LEGO did a great job with this Minifigure. I feel that 8.5/10 is again a fair score.</p>

<h2><strong>Value</strong></h2>

<p>So, this set is the same price as all single Microfighters. In South Africa I paid a little extra, coming to $11.8, but it&#39;s barely a difference, so I don&#39;t mind. The set has 86 pieces, which is quite a small number, however it does come with a pretty high quality Minifig, who is currently only available in the much more expensive full-sized Resistance Y-Wing. I believe that 9/10 meets the case here.</p>

<h3><b>Overall thoughts</b></h3>

<p>In conclusion, it&#39;s a good design, with a good Minifig, which I suppose might be desirable for some people. The set isn&#39;t perfect, but for a Microfighter it&#39;s pretty darn good. There are few things to complain about, and at $10 it won&#39;t be a waste to buy. My score comes to a total of 86/100, which I think is fair.</p>
