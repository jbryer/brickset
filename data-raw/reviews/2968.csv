"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-31T10:42:39Z","Not too bad nt the best","I bought this set last year. It is very good, but the two sections of the compound will not stay together if you mave them to a different spot. Also, the crate thing does not work very well, and there is almost no room to put the dinos anywhere if you want them to do something like peacefully graze.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-18T03:12:24Z","Wicked","This is a wicked set and it is my favourite Dino island set (I only own a few). It was probaly the one for the greatest value because you could play with this set for hours and not get bored. All the hidden doors and passages are cool and the minifigs are great. The plane is wicked as it seats two people and has the net thet goes underneath which you can release. The dinosaurs have to be one of the best things about this set. The T-Rex is wicked and so is the Stegosaurous. I was upset when lego moved on to different adventures lego because this has been one of there best lego adventures sets yet. 
Pros:
* The dinosaurs 
* the minifigs
* the research center
* the satalite dish (or whatever it is) that folds out
* The vehicles
Cons:
* Needs the bridge to make it looke effective to the eye

Overall I would have liked lego to have made more dinosaurs, like the compsognathus or the spinosaurous. The dinosaurs they have made are cool anyway. This is a great set and I recommend you to get it if you see it anywhere.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

 I personally loved the Adventurers theme; even though it was a cheap rip-off of Indiana Jones. This set has true playability,
and great building. A trap door awaits you after you cross the bridge from the dock, so watch out because you fall into a snake pit if a pin is pulled. If Sam Sinister comes after the baby dino in his twin-rotor, net dropping airplane, alert the museum in New York with the satellite on the opening roof. Make an effort of defense by launching your own net at the big-time crook and his henchman. Quickly grab the gleaming gem from the gated wall, as you climb up to the study and spill your coffee as you race down to the awaiting car on the zip-line. Grab all of the supplies you need before racing through the desert in the car, chasing new species of dinosaur, trying to escape. This set is a story of its own. I give this set an eight out of five.       ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-02T07:14:04.1Z","LEGO Adventurers (Dino Island) - Dino Research Compound Review","This set really has some nice play features in there and I also can't complain about the number of minifigs. What I think is cool about this is that you get 3 dinosaurs, a boat, a jeep and a plane in this set as well. The ceiling of the jeep opens very easily and the trunk is able to open as well. The plane is a very cool part of this set, too. We get two cockpits and two propellers which spin full 360°. On the bottom you can see a lever which is able to drop a net to capture the dinosaurs.<br><br>The main attraction is the building itself. The build of this set is great and there're also no stickers to worry about. I like the way how you can attach the building and the other side of the river with the bridge. The other side of the river has a crane which sviwels full 360° and you're also able to move it up and down. There's also a tree where you can hide some stuff in there.<br><br>The best thing about this set is the building itself. On the front of the building you can see a nice stairway and on the top is a floor which can disappear. On the ground you can also see a gate which you can open, a campfire and a rock. On the first floor you can also see a catapult which can launch a net. The ceiling over the floor with the disappearing floor can be removed and next to the ceiling is a small lab. The coolest play feature of this set is that you can open the ceiling on the top of the lab and then you're able to see a radar which sviwels full 360°. It's a really cool set to have and it really has some nice play features.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"guerillaroperfrenzy","2009-12-27T23:53:57.607Z","Oh, sweet nostalgia...","I got this set on Christmas '01 when I was in 5th grade, and it was the first and only ""big"" set I ever had, as most of my LEGOs were hand-me-downs from my brother (so set like Blacktron II and Space Police).  Needless to say it was a great Christmas.  

My favorite part of this set is the replay value it had in it's original, or only slightly modified, form.  I was one of those kids who would build a set, then tear it down to use the parts for something original, especially since I had, and still do have, an interest in the armed forces.  

I used this place as a dinosaur research base for about one day before my elite special forces team (led by four former Space Police officers, and backed up by about six Blacktron II ""shock-troopers"") raided it to rescue hostages being held in the secret prison.

One of the best parts of this set is the room for customization.  by the end I had converted the top portion to a respectable living area for a warlord, complete with a walled balcony on the brown exterior part (where the scientist with the sextant is standing), and had made the prison an actual prison with think walls.

Maybe this review is biased because this set only brings back fond memories, but it's capable of being replayable in its original form, and allows for customization, which is what LEGO is all about.  



This Christmas, I was talking to my brother and we got on the subject of LEGOs and how awesome they were.  So we decided to dig them out and see what we could manage to put back together.  He began to reconstruct one of his favorite Blacktron II sets, and I reached for this set's instruction manual...

Wish me luck as I attempt to find all the pieces from the black-hole that is a LEGO tote. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"itsaturkey","2010-02-10T21:48:12.14Z","One of the Best","<p>This is a Lego classic. Not many set's are as flawless, fun,  imaginative, creative, shall I go on? Not only does it provide HOURS of  playing time, but also includes a long and thrilling build. The box  itself is a masterpiece. This set appeals greatly to both KFOL's and  AFOL's.</p>
<h4>Main Island:</h4>
<p>The main island includes three floors. The first floor is sort of a camp  and jail. The camp includes a large rock, a toasty warm fire, and some  unwelcome scorpions and spiders, not to mention the pot with some blue  thing cooking inside it. The jail isn't really 'jail like'. It has a  wall that can go up and down, but nothing else to keep the prisoner from  escaping. <br />
The second floor is mostly a dino trap see-saw. If you press down on one  side, a folded net will shoot up, and hopefully catch the unsuspecting  Dino. There is also a trap door.<br />
The third floor is really amazing. It's mostly a little hut with a  satellite that pops up and down (REALLY cool) and a little balcony that  the Doc can walk onto and look around.</p>
<h4>Second Island:</h4>
<p>A nifty little bridge connects the two islands together. This one is  like a research island. There's a tree that comes up to reveal some  precious items. A grappling hook station that WORKS also connects the  two island together (It is REALLY AWESOME AND AMAZING!) PLUS a boat station that lifts the boat out an in of the water.</p>
<h4>Vehicles:</h4>
<p>Three vehicles are included in this set. A boat, a buggy, and a villain  plane. The boat is just the standard wooded rowboat with seats. The  buggy is a cool little golf cart style car. The back lifts up (so you  can put some luggage there) and also the roof lifts up. Even the engine  lifts up and down! A very unique car indeed. The plane holds two  passengers and can drop a net (pretty cool, huh?)</p>
<h4>Minifigures:</h4>
<p>This set includes a Desert Johny Thunder, Dr. Charles (Lightning?), Mike, Gail Storm, Mr. Cunningham, and Baron Von Baron. Johny Thunder is just the usual, Dr. Charles is the usual. Gail Storm is pretty much the usual too. Mike, who I think is a scientist (I'm not sure, I didn't follow the story) has a interesting face, a cross between a a kid, teenager, and rookie. His hat is&nbsp; a nice Dk brown color. Cunningham has a perfect expression, he looks like a bumbling evil side kick. Baron Von Baron is one of my personnel FAVORITE minifigs. He is a classic villain. With the glass eye thing, a scar on his face, an evil mustache, and a hook make him truly the BEST original Lego villain.</p>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Extra's: <br />
</span></h4>
<p>This set includes four (that's right, FOUR) Dinosaurs! A T-Rex, A Pterodactyl, and a....a spiky dinosaur (I can never remember Dino names :P) and a baby T-Rex. The T-Rex is amaaaaaaazing :D His large tail, top of his head, and arms come off. His legs don't move, which is NOT amaaaaazing :] The Pterodactyl has NO movement at all. It's legs can pick things up. Even with the little mobility it still looks great and fierce (well, as fierce as a Lego CAN be) The 'spiky dino' has a moving tail. nothing else moves. Still, it is very cool. The baby T-rex is just a....baby...T-rex :D &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; List of Accessories: Shovel, pick axe, back pack, two oars, two chains, two nets, rifles, two spiders, scorpion, snake, a telescope thing, pistols, mugs and LOTS more.</p>
<h4>Conclusion: </h4>
<p>This set is amazing! With so many Minifigs, Dinosaurs, Vehicles, and accessories, how could you NOT ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS SET? If ever you should come across this set, BUY IT. I can guarantee you that you will LOVE this set as much as I do if you ever get.<br />
I hope my review helped you (And convinced you to go out and buy this set right now :P</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Don_Cristo","2010-07-30T05:11:53.387Z","An incredible potential in your hands","Back in the old days, I bought this set. I also owned other smaller Adventurers sets, but this one was definitely the best in many ways. Never again did TLC release such a playable set: 4 dinos, including a baby, spiders, a scorpion, lots of minifigs, 3 vehicles (land, sea and air), a brick-built tree, a BURP, LOTS of accessories, thick baseplates including the rare 'L-shaped' baseplate, a construction with many features, the 3 connected structures, chains, nets, that is to say more playable elements that you've ever seen in one official model. Probably the most interesting set I ever got. If you get the chance of getting one, do not let it go, you'd really miss something.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,4
"Halhi141","2013-08-23T11:58:13.903Z","A good idea, but a not-so-great execution.","<p><br></p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><div>At around 40 pages long, the instructions are shorter than in modern sets, but they aren't too challenging to follow. There's instructions for some small alternate builds in the back.</div>
<h4>Parts</h4><div>Pieces of interest include three Dino's, 51 brown 2x2 bricks, three printed 6x8 slopes, and a working magnifying glass.</div>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><div>Six of them. They're nicely detailed, but given all the vehicles and features, it feels like the set needs more...</div>
<h4>The build</h4><div>The build was fairly interesting and not repetitive. The various functions made it fairly interesting, rather than just a bunch of brick stacking.</div><div><br></div><div><br></div>
<h4>The completed model</h4><div>I'll go over the finished set in sections.</div><div><br></div><div>The car is nicely made, the details are sufficient, and the function (an arm that has a chain to wrap around a dinosaur's neck) is good. I will point out two random 2x2 red plates at the bottom, which serve no purpose whatsoever. Overall this is a nice start to the set. Let's see it the rest is this good.</div><div><br></div><div>The plane is also nice, swooshable, and playable. The net dropping feature works well, though like the other net feature it's basically impossible to catch a dinosaur, and the engines look excellent.</div><div><br></div><div>Then we get to the biggest, and weakest, part of the set: the research center. What can I say, it's basically a rainbow warrior. This is the reason I took this set apart days ago, it looks really bad. The colors (green, brown, tan, red, light grey, dark grey, black, white,..) are rídiculous.</div><div>The functions are decent though. The first one is a trapdoor on the walkway to it....no comment. This set just lacks practicality in this way. Why do they put a trapdoor in their research facility...?</div><div>Next there's an opening gate. It's placed strangely, though, and the colors are horrible.</div><div><br></div><div>The net launcher is fine, though it takes up far too much space.</div><div><br></div><div>Opening the roof makes the satellite dish go up, which works well.</div><div><br></div><div>There's also a zipline thing to push a crate down. A nice idea, but there's too much friction. If only you didn't have to pull it all the way down...</div><div><br></div><div>There's also a crane arm that works well. Not much else to say.</div><div><br></div><div>The (ugly) tree falls down, to reveal a yellow tile underneath. No comment.</div><div><br></div>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>So the set has a lot of functions, but they're simple, don't make sense, and the model looks bad.</div><div><br></div><div>Overall the set isn't as good as others have said, and I'd recommend spending your money elsewhere.</div>",TRUE,3,3,5,4,3
"Classic_Brick_Studios","2021-06-07T10:00:47.717Z","We're gonna hunt some Dinosaurs!","<p><em>On the mysterious island in the middle of the Bermuda Triangle, Johnny Thunder and his brave adventurers have discovered living Dinosaurs. In preparation to study them, the team has set up camp and transported everything needed to the island, to gain as much knowledge as possible about these creatures. However, soon enough they will become animal rights activists instead of scientists, as the dreaded Baron von Barron and his big game hunters are here to capture the animals and sell them off on the black market...</em></p>

<p>My second Review on Brickset and I do it on yet another Adventurers set. This time from the third wave of the theme, a subtheme, that merges the idea of Indiana Jones with Jurassic Park. This time, instead of hunting for treasures, Johnny Thunder and his team are studying Dinosaurs in their natural habitat. Now first of all, I want to acknowledge that we are in the dreaded era of &quot;Juniorisation&quot; and therefor the set has some shortcomings, when it comes to detail. However, I think this is still one of the gems of this time and in the following paragraphs I will explain, why I think this set is very underrated.</p>

<p>My story with the set is a rather unfortunate one. When I started to play with LEGO, the era of Jack Stone had begun. Luckily for me, there were still some leftover sets on some store shelves from earlier years, and so I got a few of the smaller Adventurers Dino Island sets as my first sets ever. Of course back in the day I was a massive Dinosaur fan (and still am in fact) and of course I wanted the big set. Unfortunately my parents weren&#39;t able to find it left over in any store. So now that I am an Afol, I finally got around to spear this white whale of my childhood. Here comes my take on this not very beloved set...</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>We get 6 figures in total and in just one set, we have the main cast, except for Alexis Sinister. Included are all four heroes and two of the villains: Johnny Thunder, Gail Storm, Dr. Charles Lightning and Mike, as well as the Baron von Barron and Mr. Cunningham.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know why Harry Cane wasn&#39;t part of this subtheme, maybe he is scared of Dinosaurs, who knows, but I would&#39;ve loved to see him included as well...</p>

<p><strong>The Dinosaurs</strong></p>

<p>I love the figures, but the real stars are the Dinosaurs. They look quite dated by today&#39;s standarts but that allowed LEGO to focus more on the build and put a few dinosaurs in the sets. (Compared to the Jurassic World Sets of today, that you basicly only buy for the Dinosaur and most of the time there is only one included). Also it needs to be said, that back in the day, I remember that I really wanted that T-Rex and it didn&#39;t bother me at all, that it looks not that realistic. Personally I think I prefer these simpler ones, over the newer ones.</p>

<p>Included are a T-Rex, a Stegosaurus, a Baby T-Rex and a Pterodactyl. Look where you find four Dinosaurs in an 80$ set nowadays...</p>

<p><strong>The vehicles</strong></p>

<p>In my opinion these are another strong point of the set. They stand out from other adventurers vehicles and are a little more unique in their design, especially the airplane. (though I&#39;m not sure, why it has two stearing wheels)</p>

<p>They also include playfeatures to capture dinos, so there isn&#39;t anything to complain with them. I really like the look of that little old-timer-Jeep.</p>

<p><strong>The Research Compound</strong></p>

<p>This set isn&#39;t the most beautiful looking design around. However, I feel like as a rusty compound cobbled together it does achieve the feel that LEGO probably aimed for with this one. I&#39;m not too keen on some of the colour choices, but strangely when build up and seeing the set &quot;in the flesh&quot;, I really like the look and atmosphere it creates.</p>

<p>Playfeatures reach from net-shooting to prison cell escaping and trap-dooring. As far as that goes, this set really has much to offer.</p>

<p>Admittedly the interior in the first floor is quite limited but the little tower on top has a research table with micoscope and some supplies as well as a radar dish that can be raised out of the roof. A fun model, just not perfect.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>While not as good as 5988 Temple of Anubis, I still think this set doesn&#39;t deserve even half the hate it gets. It is not a display model, that is perfectly clear, but for kids, this offers so many possibilities that it is hard to fault it. Also you get a good amount of Dinosaurs and vehicles, so your adventure is ready immediatly! I prefer this set over all Jurassic World sets of today and I think for the 80 bucks you pay for it on Ebay and Bricklink (if not less), it is a steal. I can highly recomment this set.</p>
