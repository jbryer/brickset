"TBillz","2020-06-02T15:12:59.933Z","Amazing Brick Built Bantha","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Introduction</b> &ndash; I&rsquo;ve never had a Skyhopper pilot in my collection so I figured for a relatively inexpensive set, what the heck I&rsquo;ll get it. There&rsquo;s more to this set though that i didn&rsquo;t appreciate it&rsquo;s beauty before building. Maybe because it&rsquo;s brown? Probably because it&rsquo;s brown.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Minifigures</b> &ndash; 10/10 As I mentioned the Skyhopper pilot was the initial draw for me. The printing is really clean and sharp. Not much more than a flight suit and harness but good never the less. It also includes an awesome fighter pilot helmet in a color not used very often in the Star Wars sets. The Tusken is a new print for this year but not exclusive to this set. I love the molded head and honestly, it does seem like this is the perfect Lego form of a Tusken Raider.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The Build </b>&ndash; 6/10 To me the build comes down to two parts. I really enjoyed building the Bantha as it was the first time I&rsquo;ve built one like this. The way the parts are utilized is so clever. You think you&rsquo;re just making this block of bricks and then the finishing pieces pull the whole design together. I love getting actual molded figures but as far as brick built figures go, this is awesome. The Skyhopper was less of a thrill to be honest. It comes together decent but wouldn&rsquo;t be the draw to the set in my opinion.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Parts</b> &ndash; 7/10 The Bantha parts are great, love the mix of what you get to create something that in my opinion looks like a very close brick built version of what you see on the big screen. As a Star Wars fan you can instantly recognize what it is. It&rsquo;s hard to believe so many shades of brown and tan can create a piece this beautiful. There are some unique parts that make up the horns as well as less used parts to make up the fur details. The Skyhopper would be a good addition to your parts bin. I don&rsquo;t know what it is about it, but it just says &ldquo;tear me apart&rdquo;.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Value</b> &ndash; 9/10 As a $20 set for 200 pieces those who stick to part count would say it is middle of the road which is what you come to expect. It&rsquo;s a different take on the Microfighters as we&rsquo;ve come to know them as military or at least combat vehicles/ships. The overall price is pretty close, but these 200 pieces are very small so one could say its relative price is slightly high. I love half of the set, the other half&rsquo;s value comes in that you can repurpose the parts well.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Overall</b> &ndash; 8/10 I like the figures and though these two aren&rsquo;t traditional adversaries, I&rsquo;m sure there is some play to the set with imagination. Microfighters are geared towards children for sure and to that this is a very easy build yet play inspiring set. &nbsp;I think the highlight of the set is the brick built Bantha. This is a homerun build. If you have any Tatooine displays this addition would definitely compliment your layout as an adult fan. The Bantha carries the set, the Minifigures make it a well-rounded addition to your collection.</p>

"KarolWes","2021-02-17T14:32:23.627Z","First bantha ever","<p>Microfighters are great sets. Since 2019 LEGO is making double sets with Star Wars animal in them. After getting dewback, now we have bantha. And it looks astonishing.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a7md2I7e5GYjo1-EDpBrgCA19BH0FOKyOvwBdZIj2-7zWsbOymnTUMRqdv_42DSZNQvan14b3v3oGwyIoDvm7M-124ukX3qsvJDzUuG6d-tl_o4wCp2GP188RIcT9zhaJ0nxyB_L6p4=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>Fans were dying to see LEGO attempt on making bantha since the release of Star Wars game in 2006. After 14 years we finally got one. I think this is a great model. The fur on its sides looks amazing, overhanging the legs. Legs themselves are really simple, just 1x2 inv slope, but works great. You can give your creature a walking position simply by turning&nbsp;the slope around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/1UEprUyWzAvUmgZdfgmpGwJQGA2qSV3JMGRFwbpV6bSc_StI3DNRuGTMAcaZaIdPkTk-dQn9HvhezBpX5vgXcAtqj__JduEenVcDvwg0cdiNq2piOt7VQfXN2r5gWKrYqir3ON8s464=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p>The tail is made of just a couple bricks stuck together, but still looks good. It has that furry look to it, and thanks to two colors of brown, has some depth. The back of the animal is nicely curved and finished with small slopes.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/GCpcixCvHmLwBX2MuHYuP3k0x7XNpe1bQxIDA9FVb_aeB0D1iChLtW6mvOO5lle_OdRNzplnGDG3HHfCDw3Hmae443X6Dm2lGiv90DfWIycs3nMXd52wNco3eosUOmLAnaUek_RAuQY=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p>At the top of the bantha there is a seat (saddle) for a tusken rider. It extends to the sides of the animal in the form of some dark orange slopes and tails. It looks OK. At the top there is also a small imitation of a backpack or something like that, that also has a clip to hold a figure weapon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uuQCQb8WicunNLXeIu12ZIAwFmnUYRlyanJHL5LrAKKosJ7KygXXJUkcnYqMx7XvJ_SrO_wAgyjTTNutfB0ZAsVChmaGY1JFN8zO81IW-Au2aS1LZmMC5oCTNY7YPxwpYrly9fOVB54=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p>The head is designed perfectly. Thanks to use of cut curved bricks it has again a very furry look. Combination of studded and flat surfaces also helps to that. The mouth are covered in lighter bricks. Eyes are black and looks great. The small printing of pupil adds a lot. Horns in tan use old tauntaun horn piece, which looks unexpectedly good. Overall, this creature is one great model.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/p_C2h5iJHp_eDdythDvNJFyFfDssSwHkch6quH_Y3rZgvRab4hgFs42zN3hGLJ9QB6h1kdpcMMPXVmssAbYdkaAPquFXPoc2Kj5qdJxkJxVTXJKbsYU1Ssm8nJ5O-HJ3Rabfyjx097E=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p>The second model is T-16 Skyhopper. It is the third iteration of this craft, after two bigger made in 2003 and 2015. This ship looks OK, in real life better than I was expecting. The main fin is design very strongly and sturdy, but is a bit to thick. The red details look good. Flags making sloppy shape of this craft is a very clever move. Wings are quite simple, with a red position light on each. The front looks OK, very similar to one in the oldest set, when the canopy wasn&#39;t closed.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/OopCGRqg59iYqYMHW977WtIxLzVpXoomE3W16Zs7gsWi3rE2p6MxUgpT8Sr96eQVdqWzSzoOtORMDZgGCtj7tYFWJvDVtcn785H89522AHEaeoz14JdOKYU0byd_OXWLVkUUb40TULo=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p>The lower section uses some minor details like studs or curves. It looks good with a big canon at the front, which is decorated with a technic gear. Stud shooters are attached underneath the wings, and as usual are way too big for this model. It adds to the playability, though.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/JAHEtbvsADV67z_m5uK9da-MFQM9E8e0wJ-ms0O8FpccdEwvHp3Ww12LPwKh4EFp_860sjsJpaP7GyvcrcwICQagUU4i4YbXJ1DVYpQNNz3_3kFziNl7GSMvsPLJoLrNAXbLc8O-_kw=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>The first minifig is a Tusken Rider. His print changed a bit in compare to the latest version, which is good if you&nbsp;are planing on making a Tusken village. Print is decent, sacks and belts are very detailed. Head is a special mold, with a shape of straps and spikes. The mask looks very accurate. He is equipped with a gaffi stick, which generally is the same as always, just in different colors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vQwvgpGwjrDQcfNsVk3ITsOqx5jiomRQ5D3r5unnHvjgY0Wzi__A_5k15w4-TQuFYLMlj8K3o6lVslSW45yUjDszZ6FEbuDPhqHi7ko8cIlZvTy5CR0cUrV_ymo0-xYHqOpM9J3nEAg=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p>The second guy is Skyhopper pilot. HE also looks very similar to the one from the previous set. He is wearing a dark red jacket with some belts on it and has plain dark red legs. The helmet has the same details as previously. He has doublesided face. On one side he has his visor down, risen eyebrow and closed mouth. On the other visor is missing, but he is happier: has opened mouth. A chin strap can be seen on both sides. He is using a small blaster gun.</p>

<p>[img]https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/d93CJWMZ0FRxwrdgAwFQB2kv41-lrmeLTBv679DV6Sl3fxb-RarHgfYyT0Lk-FvxbW3CbowS9uo1DXkdqXTOFQWdNPi6jezKrDJYA1-SC6ziL9TtP2SBLsYMhr89Zxpw4sGUHpm7YfU=w1920-h1080[/img]</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There are some, that are particularly more valuable than the rest. The most important is huge amount of cut 1x2 curved bricks in dark brown. Not the most useful color, but the part is great. Also, there is a lot of brick with studs on side and 1x3 jumpers.&nbsp;&nbsp;White 3l stick are quite useful too. Tauntaun horns have no particular usage, but looks cool and are unique. Overall, got a set of parts.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Set looks great, has nice parts, poor minifigs just for themselves, but quite useful when you are building some kind of vignette. Playability is low, but if your kids like to just fly around, this is a great choice. And it is not too expensive.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-10-16T06:37:48.01Z","Definitely Not Bantha Fodder","<p>I was intrigued by this set as it contains a bantha, but didn&#39;t really care to get it as I&#39;m not really into these little builds. However, when the set was on sale for $12 I simply couldn&#39;t pass up the opportunity to get one. I was actually very pleasantly surprised by the set as the two builds actually look quite nice and I now have a bantha to rome around Tatooine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigures&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sand person is the highlight here, even though it isn&#39;t unique, these guys are relatively hard to come by so adding another to your collection is always worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The T-16 Pilot is unique, but who is he really? Anyways, the minifigure looks nice and it is fairly unusual to get figures of normal people in a Star Wars set, so I really can&#39;t complain. I do wish however that I knew what the symbols on his helmet are for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Bantha</p>

<p>I consider the bantha to be the highlight of this set. It&#39;s a fairly straightforward build using a bit of SNOT for its fur, a clip joint for its tail, and a ball joint for its neck. The most difficult part is figuring out which dark brown parts go where as the color is nearly impossible to see in the instructions, which by the way are a separate book from the T-16. I will say that I wish the head wasn&#39;t &quot;floating&quot;, certainly Lego could have concealed the neck joint in a similar way to how they concealed the tail joint. Yes, depending on how it&#39;s done it may restrict movement a bit, but a floating head with a skinny gray neck just looks bad from the side. I think that this is something I will have to modify. While the bantha may be a little small, it is reasonable and looks good enough with a sand person riding it. Overall I am very happy with it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>T-16 Skyhopper</p>

<p>This may be the most worthless ship in the galaxy seeing how it only appears as a toy that Luke plays with as C-3PO takes a bath. So if anything, a Lego representation of it ought to be small like a toy, and while this may be a little too big for a Luke minifigure to hold in his hand, I feel this a very appropriate size for this ship. It certainly wouldn&#39;t be worth investing in a larger one. The model does look good. While it may lack a cockpit and the minifigure just sits on top, that is the style of microfighters so it&#39;s hard to complain. I will say that it does look much better with the pilot sitting on top, so if you only want the ship you may want to add a few bricks to cover up the seat, I imagine some cheese wedges would make it look more complete.</p>

<p>Given its small size, it actually is an amazingly complex build as it utilizes a bit of technic in the vertical wing, and uses a bar to get the other two wings at a perfect angle, and some flags to connect them smoothly at the top. By no means is it a difficult build, but it isn&#39;t just plain old stacking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t call this set a must have, but if you picked it up for $12 on prime day&nbsp;you will be very happy. I kind of wish that they sold the two models separately as I may have been convinced to purchase a few more banthas.&nbsp;But since the sale is over now I don&#39;t really need to purchase a second set at full price, even though $20 is a very reasonable price for this set. I recommend this set for anyone who is putting together a Tatooine collection, but if you aren&#39;t it isn&#39;t really all that necessary.&nbsp;</p>

"JayTheNinja19","2020-11-17T13:49:26.73Z","T-16 Skyhopper vs Bantha Microfighters: Good Minifigs, better builds.","<p>When I saw this set for the first time, I decided I had to get it to go with my sister&#39;s Dewback vs Droid transport Microfighter combo. And so far&nbsp;I&nbsp;must say that this is my favourite&nbsp;of the combo Microfighter series. We&#39;ve never got a LEGO Bantha before, so it&#39;s interesting to see how the first attempt came out.&nbsp;Anyway, let&#39;s get into the review.</p>

<h2><strong>The Build</strong></h2>

<p>I think we can all agree that the main feature of Microfighters is the build, although some sets do come with great Minifigures. I&#39;ll start with the T-16 Skyhopper build, as I like it the least. The build is decent. The problem&nbsp;is that the centre of the build is quite bulky, and makes the wings look shorter than they should. It&#39;s by no means the most elegant or good-looking Microfighter, but I do appreciate that LEGO gave us a more obscure vehicle. Overall it&#39;s one of my less-favourite builds in the&nbsp;line, but not bad. I&#39;d say 7/10 is fair.</p>

<p>The Bantha, on the other hand, is an interesting build, and goes really well with the Dewback released the year before. It makes for a cute creature, and the texturing of its fur is very well done. A saddle is provided for the Tusken Raider, with a clip to attach his Gaffi stick. My only complaint about the Bantha is that the horns stick out too far. I know that they have curled horns, but extending them fails to capture that in my opinion. It would&#39;ve been better to simply attach the pieces to 1-2 studs with holes. In the end, it&#39;s definitely in my top 5 Microfighters of all time and I believe that 9/10 is an accurate score. The two combine for a score of 8/10.</p>

<h2><strong>The Minifigures</strong></h2>

<p>The Minifigs in this set are pretty good, but not great. Both are well executed, but the T-16 Skyhopper Pilot is simply not very interesting. He has a detailed torso print, and a dual-sided head. Accompanying that is his grey pilot&#39;s helmet, with printed details. His legs have no printing, which is a little disappointing as I think it would&#39;ve been nice to see something new.</p>

<p>The Tusken Raider is the same as seen before. A good level of detail on the torso and legs, and of course the same&nbsp;head design we&#39;ve seen before. This figure can&#39;t really get better, but the part that brings my Minifig score down to 8.5/10 is the T-16 Pilot, as I feel he&#39;s just lacking somewhat.</p>

<h3><strong>Value</strong></h3>

<p>The value of this set is quite good, at $20. In South Africa I bought it for $22, so the difference is small and I can&#39;t really complain. If the price were just a couple dollars cheaper, I&#39;d say the price is perfect, but really no major complaints here. I feel that 8.5/10 is fair.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall</strong></h3>

<p>At the end of the day, I like this set. It&#39;s one of those small, fun builds, and the Bantha really is a highlight. It&#39;s a&nbsp;perfect small gift for Christmas, or even just as a stocking filler. Again, my only complaints are that the Skyhopper&nbsp;seems a bit awkward, the Pilot could use some extra detail, and the horns of the Bantha are a bit wide. My overall score comes to just over 83/100. A good buy, that would be perfect if a few small changes were made, and if the price were slightly less.</p>
