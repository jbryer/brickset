<p>You get one sith officer, one sith trooper and two sith jetpack&nbsp;troopers. Whilst these figures are hard to get a whole, in general, in fact, I believe the officer is unique to this set, I think they could&#39;ve altered the layout a bit more and replaced one of the jetpack troopers with a standard trooper. It would make more sense in terms of the actual army, there&#39;re&nbsp;more standard troopers than jetpack&nbsp;troopers within the movie the set is based of: <em>The Rise of Skywalker.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Honestly, that&#39;s more of a nitpick than anything else and doesn&#39;t take away that these figures are really cool and I&#39;m glad I got them.</p>

"henrymorris476","2020-03-24T10:36:41.867Z","The Final Order Begins","<p>After&nbsp;seeing the Rise of Skywalker, the first thing I wanted to do was get my hands on some Lego Sith Troopers! As they only appeared in 75256, a set at the top end of the price range, this battlepack is a welcome way of boosting your Sith Eternal/Final Order&nbsp;roster!</p>

<p><strong>Build and Parts</strong></p>

<p>The build, whilst not overly exciting, does at least try to replicate a real vehicle from the Star Wars Universe - namely the First Order Snowspeeder&nbsp;(on a small scale) - and it does this fairly successfully. What relevance this has to the Rise of Skywalker, however, who knows!&nbsp;It goes together pretty quickly and doesn&#39;t feature any particularly interesting building techniques. Parts wise, aside from the minifigures, the most useful bits are the plates and tiles in sand blue.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This is where 75266, like all other battlepacks, shines! All four of the included figures are superb, with extreme attention to detail taken on each of them. The Sith Jet-troopers are possibly the stand-out, being unique to this set, although most people will likely be after the more generic Sith Trooper. Sadly the set only includes one of these, and although the officer (also unique) is&nbsp;a great figure, another trooper would have been preferable. All of the figures include a stud shooter (bring back blasters!), one of which can be attached to the Snowspeeder.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>A great battlepack&nbsp;with a good selection of figures and a slightly better than average build - not really anything to complain about! At this price-point, what more can you ask for? Now I just need to buy 20 more so the Sith can truly be reborn...</p>

<p>Recently Lego seems to have been sort of&nbsp;in the middle of understanding fully of what a model battlepack really is, the figures should have been 2 sith troopers and 2 sith jet troopers. The officer is useless, I don&#39;t know if Lego loves to put them into all the battlepacks or if disney says they need to be in there. The actual figs are great, they all have great detail.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The build</h2>

<p>Of course the build is a battlepack build and is nothing special, other than the gorgeous colour they use, the sand blue is awesome!</p>

"Struhadlo","2020-03-16T22:21:53.99Z","Great idea, bad execution.","<p>I mean, having a final order battle pack was inevitable and it is only good that it got made this soon. The whole concept of this particular set works just fine. But the execution is where it kind of fails.</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>

<p>Lego seems to utterly fail at understanding what a battle pack is suppose to represent in the last years. Ever since the abomination which was the First order battle pack almost every single battle pack suffered from some kind of shortcoming. And this one has to be the strangest one yet. Why on Earth would you ever put two special troopers into a battle pack? The set&#39;s name is Sith Trooper Battle Pack so understandably one would expect no shortage of said Sith troopers. One would be wrong. What we got is a confused attempt at making&nbsp;a better battle pack than the most of the failures of the recent years. Finally, we do not have to suffer through bunch of useless officers and crew members, so it might be safe to say that Lego is on the right path. But there is still a long way to go my friends. The correct way about this battle pack would be to have 3 Sith Troopers and one Sith Jet Trooper. Nobody cares about officers. The acceptable way would be having 2 and 2 of the mentioned troops. And the worst case scenario would be 1 officers accompanied by 2 Sith Troopers and 1 Sith Jet Trooper.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The look of the minifigs is stellar though! The Sith Trooper is a treasure to behold for sure and the jet guys look extremely&nbsp;sleek too. The officer as much as I hate to have them in a battle pack looks very polished and appropriate as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>The vehicle looks alright I suppose. There is nothing wrong about it. It can carry 3 minifigs comfortably and all 4 if you try hard enough. The colour theme seems rather strange next to the red commando of death but as a standalone thing it works quite well. It is definitely one of the better working mini troops transports.</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>Oh yes, the infamous stud shooters. On the vehicle the larger stud shooter canon looks and works just fine. In the hands of any trooper expect for few lucky exceptions it looks just painfully awkward. It can never work even if Lego tries to shoehorn as many of them into their sets as possible. These shooters just look like giant&nbsp;hairdryers, and they do not look good on display. As for their playability&nbsp;they work fine&nbsp;but you will lose all your studs rather quickly and reloading them is awful. I guess that some kids might find some joy in having these, but I can never imagine me as a kid being excited over these atrocities&nbsp;compared to regular blasters.</p>

<p><b>FINAL THOUGHTS</b></p>

<p>This new battle looks great and it&#39;s minifgs are definitely worth having. It is not a bad battle pack by no means, but if your goal with battle packs is to build an army, then&nbsp;good luck here. What you will end up with is a group of Sith Troopers and an army of flying red boys.</p>

"ireanxax","2020-06-02T14:14:37.283Z","easy build, cheap and good minifigs for price","<p>I like this set because it&#39;s easy to build and has some good minifigs for price and is a very quick build. Given that it is one of the only sets to include sith troopers, especially the fact you get some (as far as i know) exclusive minifigs makes this set so special to me.</p>

"Puidwen","2021-04-28T02:56:43.647Z","It's a slab","<p>The speeder is basically just&nbsp; a triangle slab.&nbsp; It if had some type of military angles, i might forgive it.&nbsp; I know lego can make good set with minimum parts, i have some.&nbsp; What&#39;s worst is parts of it is hard to build.&nbsp; For instance the rear &quot;landing skids&quot; just DID NOT want to click in.&nbsp; The printing on the mini-figs is excellent, however they all come with the same generic face.&nbsp; While visually the helmet&nbsp;is a good mold,&nbsp; it does tend to pop off far too easily.&nbsp; Admittedly one of these instances was me building the backpack, but the other i was just handling the mini-fig.</p>
",TRUE,2,2,2,3,3
"StaticIsHere","2021-08-07T00:06:12.563Z","Good Figures, Not-so-Good Figure Selection.","<p><strong>The Build:&nbsp;</strong>The speeder itself looks pretty good, reminding me of the First Order Snowspeeder, and the sand blue bricks are nice to get.&nbsp;It&#39;s just your standard battle pack speeder, nothing special, but not terrible.</p>

<p><strong>The Figures:&nbsp;</strong>As with any other battle pack, the figures are the main event here. The Sith Trooper looks absolutely amazing, and it&#39;s nice to get in a cheap set. The two Sith Jetpack troopers looks equally good. The helmet and jetpacks are the same molds as the First Order Jetpack Trooper, just done in red. The Sith Officer is the least interesting of the four, although accurate.</p>

<p>However, while each of the figures are good individually, the selection chosen could have been better. The ratio of one Sith Trooper (the main bulk of a Final Order army) to two Sith Jetpack Troopers is disappointing. The Sith Officer feels like it would be better off included in the Sith TIE Fighter, or perhaps in a later Episode IX set, and could be replaced with a second Sith Trooper in this battle pack.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong>I can recommend picking up one of these battle packs in order to get these great figures, however, it makes a poor army builder with only one regular Sith Trooper included. Had this set included two Sith Troopers, it would&#39;ve been easily been a 5-star set. As it is, I can only give 4 stars.</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2020-12-27T11:49:06.03Z","Oh Lego , change one thing and this set is great ","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>The Sith trooper battle pack is a good battle pack but makes the mistake including two jet troopers instead of two Sith troopers .</p>

<p>The Minifigures -</p>

<p>The officer uses a black officer hat , a lex luthor face and standard Sith eternal officer torso and legs with red outlines , he wields a stud shooter with a fire extinguisher head at the back , the Sith trooper uses the first order stormtrooper helmet in red with the appropriate detailing , the head is angry clone and the torso and legs have accurate armour , he wields a stud shooter and finally the Sith jet troopers have the helmet from passaana speeder chase in red with accurate details , the head is angry clone , the jet pack was also introduced in that set and uses a printed 1&times;1 red tile and the torso and legs are accurate with the legs being the same as the regular Sith trooper , they both wield stud shooters and there are two of them in the set .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The speeder is on a 4&times;10 dark grey plate with outlets in the back on each side with the engine and thrust detailing in light transparent blue , the middle of the back has grille details , there are two seats one of which uses a 1&times;1 cheese slope as a windshield and a control lever , there is sand blue on each side and a space for a gunner at the position at the front which includes a spot for the officers stud shooter and there is more grille detailing and a 2&times;2 sand blue jumper plate at the front and an inverted round tile underneath to allow it to slide across surfaces .&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a good battle pack but the decision to include two Sith jet troopers is a mistake as if you were amassing a Sith cultist /eternal feet army you would want an army of Sith troopers not jet troopers so I feel that if the build stayed the same but it included ; the officer , one jet trooper and two Sith troopers but that is my opinion and I still recommend it despite personally having no interest in building an army of this faction .</p>

"Asyoung96","2021-01-02T02:37:48.28Z","Nice set decent minifigs","<p>Overall I think this set is good for what you pay for. You get 2 Sith Jet Troopers, 1 Sith Trooper and 1 Officer which are all nicely detailed and are a good addition to your collection and army. Although I will say on the Jet Troopers they do look a bit awkward in that they&#39;re a bit taller due to the Jetpack that goes under the head but overall look fantastic. As far as the main build it&#39;s okay and is what you can expect from a $15 build. You have a place for 3 of the figures, 2 in the seats and 1 manning the gun on the front of the ship. The only playability with this set is in the stud shooters but that is about it.&nbsp;Overall im happy with this set and am glad to have it in my collection.</p>

"Captainfives1514","2022-12-26T11:53:09.43Z","Soldiers of the Final Order ","<p>&nbsp;The Sith troopers battle pack is an excellent LEGO battle pack. The bright red troopers will definitely stand out in your minifigure collection.</p>

<p>&nbsp; There is one Sith trooper actually included in this battle pack. His helmet mould is the same as a First Order Stormtrooper&#39;s. With a T-shaped visor with emasculate grey stripes and detailing on the helmet. His torso is printed with red armour and some more grey stripes. His arms are unprinted. His legs have more armour printing with stripes. His head is a pre2020 clone trooper face. He carries a stud shooter.</p>

<p>&nbsp; There are two Sith Jet Troopers included in this set. Their helmets are an interesting mould with mandible like details around their helmet&#39;s vocoder. They have black and grey printing on the helmet. Their torsos have armour printing with yellow wing shaped badge on the right side of their chest plate. Their legs have the same armour printing as their foot soldier comrade. They wear a jetpack, obviously. That is a new special,&nbsp;moulded piece. With a printed tile specific only to one other set except in white. They are armed with stud shooters.</p>

<p>&nbsp; There is also a Final&nbsp;Order officer.he wears a kept with a final order symbol on the centre of the hat. The torso has red stripes down his coat and a&nbsp;silver belt. With plain black pants.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The build is straight forward and simple. It is a small two-person speeder. There is room for a pilot and a passenger/gunner. The speeder is a perfect patrol/escort vehicle for your army.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall I would say it&#39;s a great set. The only con is that there are two jet troopers and only one Sith trooper. I would have liked this set more if it was reversed.&nbsp;</p>
