"Minifig290","2019-12-27T14:50:41.407Z","One of the best Star Wars Battle Packs","<p>Hello there, hope you had a good Christmas. Now we near New Year the new 2020 sets are dropping into store shelves. Today I&#39;ll be looking at one of the many sets, the LEGO Star Wars 75267 Mandalorian Battle Pack that retails for &pound;12.99/$14.99 and has 102 pieces giving a price per part of 12p/14c. This set is a very hyped up set that is based on the new Mandalorian series.</p>

<p>Just a heads up I&#39;ve personally not watched the show so im making my judgment of this set up with whats included in the set so don&#39;t worry about any spoilers cause I don&#39;t any, Without further ado, lets take a look.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>There are four Mandalorian minifigures included in this set all having unique prints and designs, though non are named characters which is good for a battle pack, so i am going to refer to them by the colours of their helmets, Orange, Gray, Green and Blue. To note each figure each has a black stud shooter with two trans red studs to fire, and all four figures heads are unprinted black minifigure heads.</p>

<p><em><strong>Blue:</strong></em></p>

<p>Lets start of bright with the Blue Mandalorian, this figure, and the other 3, has a helmet most communally used for the Fetts but in a nice aqua blue colour with some nice purple accents and the visor having a shiny silver finish. Its torso is sand blue with dark gray arms having the chest plate in the nice aqua blue colour and a utility belt printed on, its legs also have the aqua blue print for some pockets or armor. Between the neck of this figure is a nice unprinted olive green cape which sadly is the old style of material used.</p>

<p><em><strong>Green:</strong></em></p>

<p>Now the Green Mandalorian is favorite of the four included, he has a nice Green helmet with some aqua blue cheek prints plus some silver gunshot damaged areas which is nice detail to show these figures have been in combat. On the side of the helmet is an antenna piece which you get four of in this set. This Mandalorians torso is dark green with dark blue arms that has a green chest plate printed and a utility belt printed on. The legs just have some robe details which look nice. Between this Mandalorians neck is a unprinted brown cape.</p>

<p><em><strong>Gray:</strong></em></p>

<p>Here is the Gray Mandalorian, this has a gray and orange helmet which like the Green one has some gun damage on top bu this one also has some dirt or scuffs in the orange area which gives the helmet some character. Like the Green one he also has an antenna piece. Now the torso of this figure is a dark tan with sand blue arms that has a silver chest plate and brown utility belt printed. His sand blue legs too have some robe like printing. Finally for this figure his cape is a black cape which is the most useful for me.</p>

<p><em><strong>Orange (Dark Orange):</strong></em></p>

<p>Finally the Orange Mandalorian has a nice helmet which is dark orange with some silver print for the visor. For the torso of this figure he has a dark gray with dark brown arms that has a dark orange printed chest plate with a brown and dark brown utility belt. its legs are just some unprinted dark brown legs and it also has a unprinted dark brown cape.</p>

<p><strong>Builds</strong></p>

<p>There are two builds in this set, a speeder bike and a little dugout for the Mandalorians to shoot at their enemies.</p>

<p><em><strong>Speeder Bike:</strong></em></p>

<p>The speeder bike build has a enough space to fit a single Mandalorian, the bike has two stud shooters at the side that have some spare red studs to shoot. the bike has many parts used to give it some curvature and depth plus at the front some small wing parts and at the front a handle for the driver to hold on to. The build is built around a single 2x6 plate.</p>

<p><em><strong>Dugout:</strong></em></p>

<p>Finally the little dugout for one Mandalorian to fire from that is built on a 6x6 light gray plate which has some sloped gray bricks to represent some rocks and some brown parts to show some wooden build to give some more cover, on the top of on area at the front is a jumper plate that you can place on of the Mandalorians stud shooters on plus there is some studded area to place the extra 6 studs that aren&#39;t in one of the 6 stud shooters in the set, so of the 102 parts 12 of them are red studs.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To conclude this review, i got to say this is definitely one of the best battle packs in recent years that beat many that have been released in the past 2 years. The four figures are highly detailed and look spectacular, the builds though simple are effective and will give children lots of play value and they will enjoy the stud shooters. I also forgot to mention in the set there is a pack of antennas and visor pieces that can be attached to the figures helmets but only two antennas are used and no visor parts are.</p>

<p>I would definitely recommend this to any Star Wars fan to build up their Mandalorian army, i also would say kids would love this and some of the parts are fairly nice. its very much worth the small &pound;13/$15 price tag in my opinion and could be one of the best 2020 Star Wars sets but maybe not the best 2020 set we will have to wait and see what come out throughout the year.</p>

<p><strong>Pros - </strong>Great detailed figures, nice parts, good price value, will offer some great play times</p>

<p><strong>Cons -</strong> Would have maybe liked some more detail on the dugout but nothing major of a complaint for the set though.</p>

<p>This set is now available in the UK at LEGO Shop and will be from the 1st Jan 2020 in the US</p>

"Squid_Kid8","2020-02-14T18:36:41.973Z","This is the way, I have spoken","<p>The Minifigs&nbsp;are great, each with unique armor and colors. There are two males and two females. You can tell this by the shape of the visors. The ones that looks like <strong>T</strong>&nbsp;are the males, while the two that look like&nbsp;<strong>Y&nbsp;</strong>are the females. None of the characters are named, so are good for army building.</p>

<p>The build for the terrain is kind of a letdown compared to the previous Mando battle pack. Most of the parts went into the swoop bike, which is canonical for once :D</p>

<p>It&#39;s 15 dollars so is the same price as the other battle packs recently. The biggest problem is the stud shooters for the guns, LEGO should have included the medium size blasters as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall this is a good set, it complements the AT-ST Raider well, and is good on its own. If you a fan of Star Wars you should definitely get this set.</p>

<p>The Mandalorian battle pack (2020) is maybe one of the best battle packs of all time. It includes four different, and yet completely generic Mandalorian Minifigures. Each one has a different brightly colored&nbsp;suit of armor. They are actually inspired by background/side&nbsp;characters from the Disney+ show &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;. The one complaint&nbsp;I have with the Minifigures is that, based on the characters that they resemble,&nbsp;the one with the orange-ish&nbsp;gold helmet should have the feminine curved visor, and the one with the green helmet should have the male&nbsp;straight visor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This&nbsp;set has little to none in the way of parts. It has a few bricks, slopes, and tiles, but nothing of interest at all</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Build:</p>

<p>The speeder is lovely, and makes this set seem like it shows where the Minifigures from the Death Watch battle pack are during the time of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;. The terrain portion is surprisingly decent, and doesn&#39;t just look like a bunch of bricks thrown on a plate.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Verdict:</p>

<p>The Mandalorian Battle Pack (2020) is an amazing set. The Minifigures are great,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;builds are decent.&nbsp;and unlike some speeders that we get in battle packs, this one&nbsp;actually is&nbsp;seen in the Star Wars universe. Hopefully, we will get official Minifigures of the characters that inspired the ones with the swapped visors. Overall, I would highly recommend this set to anyone who enjoys &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, or Star Wars in general.</p>

"Slobrojoe","2020-02-01T20:06:51.893Z","‘This is the way’- The Mandalorian","<p>The Mandalorian is an incredible TV series that fits between The Return of The Jedi and The Force Awakens. Lego will no doubt&nbsp;release several sets on this subject. This is the first battle pack.</p>

<p>Note: I have watched the whole of Series 1 of the Mandalorian. These are mostly my opinions.</p>

<p>Warning: THIS DOES NOT CONTAIN SPOILERS.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Box/Instructions&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set comes in a box that is a usual sized battle pack box. The instructions are easy to follow and are not folded..</p>

<p>Minifigs&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs have been made to be customisable. I will tell you how I dressed mine after what it says in the instructions.</p>

<p>Blue Mando: this guy is super cool and is my joint favourite minifig in the set. His helmet is blue outlined in grey-silver and purple.&nbsp;There is a purple splodge on it. His face is black. He has a greenish cape that isn&#39;t as wide as the normal cape. His torso is double-sided with a blue chest plate, a brown belt and a grey top underneath. The chest plate has had some of the paint chipped off to reveal silver underneath.&nbsp;His legs are grey with two blue shin-pads. He is armed with a stud-shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Orange Mando: My joint favourite minifig.&nbsp;&nbsp;His helmet is a dark sand orange outlined in silver and black. The head is black. His cape is brown. The torso is the same as the Blue guy has except the chest plate is orangey-brown. The legs are plain brown. He is armed with a stud-shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Green Mando: My least favourite minifig. His helmet is green, outlined in silver. His head is black. The cape is brown. The torso is the same except the chest plate is green and the top is dark blue. His legs are blue with the ends of some beige robes. He is armed with a stud-shooter.</p>

<p>Grey Mando: He has a grey helmet outlined in orange. His head is black and the cape is black as well. The torso is the same except the chest plate is silver and the top is beige. The legs are the same as the Green guy but in light bley.</p>

<p>I really despise stud-shooters and immediately replaced them. This is how I armed and dressed my troopers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Blue Mando: I followed the instructions. I changed his shooter to twin blaster pistols as seen in 8014 Clone&nbsp;Walker&nbsp;Battle Pack. I put&nbsp;him on the gunner emplacement.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Orange Mando: I followed the instructions. I gave him two normal blasters and a full visor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Green Mando: I followed the instructions but gave this guy a blaster rifle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Grey Mando: I followed the instructions but gave him one blaster. He went on my speeder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts come in three plastic bags and one cardboard envelope. The first bag is medium sized and contains some minifig parts and normal pieces. The second bag has the rest of the minifig parts and more bricks. The last is tiny, containing 8 (2 different types) of visor attachments. The cardboard envelope has 4 capes stored inside. The parts are mostly grey or brown. The best pieces are the Mandalorian helmets. You get a handful of spare studs and a couple of normal pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build was quite simple, taking about 7 minutes. It was&nbsp;very enjoyable.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Completed Model&nbsp;</p>

<p>The speeder is really streamlined and is not symmetrical, adding to that Mandalorian feel. It easily fits a minifig. There are two stud shooters on the sides. The rubble is much larger than I expected and is a little disappointing. It does have a weapons holder on the side and the gun emplacement uses a stud shooter, which I replaced (an extra blaster rifle). It doesn&#39;t offer&nbsp;much cover in a shout out but might be a nice lookout post.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Price&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the UK, these battle packs have been out of stock for a while. We went to Smyths&nbsp;Toys Superstore and they had them for &pound;12.99. My dad&nbsp;bought&nbsp;three and I eventually&nbsp;bought them off him. These are really hard to get at the moment so grab as many as you can. They will be worth a lot in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:&nbsp;</p>

<p>-really cool helmets</p>

<p>-best speeder&nbsp;</p>

<p>-capes&nbsp;</p>

<p>-customisable&nbsp;</p>

<p>Neutral:&nbsp;</p>

<p>-black heads (they never take off their helmets anyway)</p>

<p>-smaller capes</p>

<p>-rubble is quite big</p>

<p>Cons:&nbsp;</p>

<p>-stud-shooters! By using stud-shooters, Lego are adding an extra three pieces per minifig and spare studs. Why can&#39;t they add in some normal weapons so we can decide?</p>

<p>-rubble is not the best</p>

<p>In my opinion, this is the best battle pack made. Apart from stud-shooters, there is no beating this set. I recommend grabbing lots to build a customisable&nbsp;army or to keep boxed and sell later.&nbsp;</p>

"vikings","2020-06-08T01:55:42.51Z","Great Battle Pack","<p><strong>Box/Instructions:</strong></p>

<p>This set comes in a small box with a small instruction booklet.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:</strong></p>

<p>You don&#39;t get any cool or unique parts in this set. The dark tan pieces are nice to get. The total piece count for the set is 102. Overall a pretty simple piece&nbsp;haul.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p>You get four minifigures in this set, all which are Mandalorians. The Grey and Green are female and the Orange and Blue are male. They all&nbsp;have hard capes which I don&#39;t like. I wish they would have given them soft capes instead, but oh well. They are all armed with stud shooters (Which I hate).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Green Mandalorian</strong></p>

<p>The green Mandalorian is a female. The curved mask markings for the eyes show that it is a female. The helmet has green, light blue and silver colors on the helmet. There is a dark grey antenna on the side of the helmet. She has a dark brown hard cape. She has a plain black head. She has printing on both sides of her torso. She has green Mandalorian armor and a brown belt. She also has printing on her legs as well. It is dark blue with tan armor on it. She is armed with a stud shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Blue Mandalorian:</strong></p>

<p>The blue Mandalorian is male. The helmet has&nbsp;blue, purple, and silver colors on it. He has a plain black head and a light swampy green hard cape. He has printing on both sides of his torso. He has blue Mandalorian armor and a brown belt and dark grey legs with a couple blue armor pads&nbsp;as well. He is armed with a stud shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Orange Mandalorian:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The orange Mandalorian is male. The helmet has orange, silver, and brown colors on it. He has a black plain head and a hard brown cape. His torso has double-sided printing on it. It has brown Mandalorian armor and a brown belt and plain dark brown legs. I was disappointed that there was no printing on his legs, as all the other ones have leg printing. He is armed with a stud shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Grey Mandalorian:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The grey Mandalorian is a female. The helmet has grey, orange, and black colors on it. She has a plain black head and a dark grey antenna on the side of the helmet. She has a black hard cape. She has printing on both sides of her torso. She has silver Mandalorian armor and a brown belt with a silver belt buckle. She has printing of her amor on her legs as well.&nbsp;She is armed with a stud shooter.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy. It took me around 10 minutes to build. You have two separate builds, one is the speeder and the other are the ground defence.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great battle pack. The figures alone are worth it. Getting these Mandalorians are just fantastic. The builds are great. The speeder is a great improvement on the one from set 7914 in 2011. It is much larger in size than the older one,&nbsp;which I love. It is equipped with two stud shooters on it, which is a nice play feature. The ground defence is nice. It is small being on a 6x6 light grey plate. It is nice, I do wish they made a way that if you got multiple of them that you could connect them together, because it doesn&#39;t seem like there is a way to do that. The ground defence has a spot for a Mandalorian to have a stud shooter and use it as a mounted gun, which is really cool. The figures are great and I love that they gave dark grey figure accessories with dark grey antennas and visors which are amazing and add to the look of the Mandalorians. I wish they gave them something other than the stud shooters (Because I hate them!). In the show they all have different weapons from dual pistols too medium blasters, too heavy turrets. It would have been nice for them to get different weapons as that is what they have at this point. Overall you can&#39;t go wrong with this battle pack. The figures and builds are great. This is a great Mandalorian army builder and is a great addition to your Star Wars collection. This is a must-have for any Lego Star Wars collector and is a great addition to anyones Lego Collection. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Packaging:</b></p>

<p>I like this new packaging for LEGO Star Wars. It is simple and yet inviting all at once. The front and back of the box is replete with scenarios for our 4 Mandalorian warriors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Nothing fancy and no notable parts outside of those used to make the figures. We get a bag full of Clonetrooper helmet attachments though. I appreciate that as I can now customize my figures to my hearts content with those. I notice though that LEGO is going back to using the paper texture cloth for the capes. These are not as stiff as the ones from yesteryear but they are crinkly and may get wrinkled in short order just from using the builds in the set.</p>

<p>Front and back these look outstanding! Though I confess I am tired of the stud shooters. I already know LEGO is a toy but those things make them look overly toyish. I wish we got some regular single piece blasters. Though I suppose with modifications these stud shooters can be turned into bazookas for your troops.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Completed Model:</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the figures are the draw LEGO did put in a few parts extra to make a simple play scenario for your figures. We get a a Mandalorian Speeder in the set of the Balutar&nbsp; Swoop class of speeders. It looks decent enough but at this scale it looks awfully clunky for a minifigure to ride on. Also their capes are long enough that sitting one down on this long term might damage the cape.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We also get some terrain to play on but the squeeze for the figure is tight and it might damage their cape. It has a clip you can use to store something else extra there if you need to. Still it is what it is, you are free to use it or part it down if it is not to your liking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Personally I wanted to try out those helmets on Sabine Wren as the one version of her that I have is helmet-less and these helmets are colorful enough to try on her. So for the curious, here you have Sabine donning some of the helmets from the pack. What do you think?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The 4 included figures are dare I say it: beautiful things. They are colorful well printed and all the extra bits included make for expanded customization options. And that is the beauty of the pack right there, you can make the set even cooler with your parts. Of course you need parts and that is major nit pick with the set: no molded blasters. Stud shooters are cool at first but for a nice diorama I think most folk would also like the older style of molded blasters also. I hope in the future both are included for children and collectors.Well worth getting despite that nit pick though.&nbsp;</p>

"Studded_Dud","2021-06-05T00:57:58.137Z","Nifty Little Battle Pack","<h3>Building Experience:</h3>

<p>As is the case with most sets, there is nothing too special about the building experience. It is a pretty simple build that any level of builder could accomplish with the instructions. The two builds are both nice and sturdy, so that helps while building.</p>

<h3>Parts:</h3>

<p>Besides the minifigure parts there aren&#39;t any special unique or rare pieces. Each minifigure comes with a stud shooter gun that shoots one clear red stud. The speeder also consists of two stud shooters but that attach to the front of it.The rubble build is built mostly out of slope pieces which are always nice to have a collection of. There are extra studs for the shooters, one extra stud per shooter. There are also a few extra helmet accessories.</p>

<h3>Minifigs:&nbsp;</h3>

<p>- Grey Mandalorian: The Grey Mandalorian is build with six pieces. The helmet features magnificent printing with a grey, orange, and black color scheme. There is a bullet dent on the top and some sort of liquid stain on the front. The helmet design continues to the back, but there is no printing. The head underneath is a basic black head, as is the same with all the other minifigures. The black cape is unique to the set and is more rectangular&nbsp;than a usual cape. The torso features beskar Mandalorian armour printing along with more detailed clothes printing underneath. The printing underneath consists of a belt, which continues to the back along with the rest of the detail. There is no arm printing. The feet are also printed and are a sand blue tone. The printing on the legs is of some kind of robe and does not continue onto the back.</p>

<p>- Green Mandalorian: The Green Mandalorian is also built with six pieces and is the exact same minifigure just with different colors and printing. The helmet is green with a bullet dent on the other side than the grey one, and also features some liquid marks around the face area. An antenna is attached to the helmet. The cape is the same rectangular cape as all the rest but in brown. None of the minifigures feature any arm printing but the detail on this ones torso is fantastic. It shows beskar armour and a belt that both continue onto the back and a robe that continues to be printed on the legs.</p>

<p>- Brown Mandalorian: The Brown Mandalorian is the least interesting of the four. The helmet has an interesting design and is in a lighter brown color. The cape is the same brown one as with the Green Mandalorian. The detail on the torso is the same as the Blue Mandalorian only with the exception that the battle marks on the armour are in different places. The legs are plain dark brown and do not have any printing on them which is disappointing, especially given that the other three do. This one also does not have an antenna.</p>

<p>- Blue Mandalorian: The Blue Mandalorian is more exciting than the brown one. The helmet has a more unique design to it than the other ones, featuring purple splotches on the head. The cape is another rectangular one but this time in a greenish shade. The torso printing is the same as the brown one except for the color differences and the battle marks on the armour. The feet have magnificent silver and blue armour printing. There is no antenna for this one either.</p>

<h3>The Build:</h3>

<p>-&nbsp;Speeder: The speeder is a fairly simple build, but it gets the job done. It has two stud shooters, one on each side, and can fit one minifigure. It&#39;s not the most aerodynamic looking vehicle but still works as a speeder.</p>

<p>- Rubble: The rubble is made mostly out of slope pieces. There is a spot for a minifigure to place their stud shooter and hide in the rubble. It also works great for a place to put the stud shooter of the minifigure riding the speeder. It is a simple build but works for a battle pack.</p>

<h3>Overall:</h3>

<p>Overall, the original price of&nbsp;&pound;12.99 / $14.99 / 14.99&euro; is reasonable given the four excellent minifigures and two decent builds. The Brown Mandalorian could have used some leg printing but other than that this set is perfect. I would highly recommend this set to any Star Wars fan, especially if they want a Mandalorian army.</p>

"miuboy","2020-02-15T18:40:10.63Z","The hidden gold of starwars","<p>My hunt for lego continues, and this was the next on the list, it took me 3 weeks to find this set, as it was sold out at my local Walmart and target...&nbsp;</p>

<p>I eventually found this at a&nbsp;nearby Barnes and nobles, and bought it for a solid 14.99$.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>packaging: classic battle pack size, with the 2019 darthvader&nbsp;with white background...</p>

<p>Figures: I never had any&nbsp;mandolorians&nbsp;in my collection, no boba, no jango, or Sabine figures, and after finding this set, I ended up getting 4 pretty cool characters that were a solid addition to the collection...</p>

<p>&quot;blue&quot; reminds me of the big guy from the mandolorian show, although it&#39;s not him, I would be cool it canonically it was...&nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;brown&quot;&nbsp;is designed very close to the original &quot;mandolorian&quot; figure from the AT-ST raider, and if this set came with a extra silver helmet, you could theoretically make him out of this guy</p>

<p>&quot;grey&quot;, going my manolorian lore, this is a female manolorian as identified by the Y visor,&nbsp;and is something we have not seen sence&nbsp;Sabine, the character is probably a alt to the brown fig</p>

<p>&quot;green&quot;&nbsp;is another female, and is my favorite figure, with the best detail, and unique coloring...</p>

<p>this set also comes with a baggy of helmet attachments, 4 right visors, and 4 helmet&nbsp;shaders...</p>

<p>Builds: this is a reference to the original 2010 mandolorian&nbsp;battle pack, but in a rustic grey and tan coloring&nbsp;instead of blue... this also has a small amount of terrain and a place to put a stud shooter, which is another reference to the turret from the original...</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>final overview: this set is a direct update from the 2010 version, and is a improvement, the vehicle is the same, but is upgraded with stud shooters, and the turret has been replaced by some terrain, this reminds me of my original battle pack, the &quot;commando&quot; set, and brought some childhood memory&#39;s...</p>

<p>&nbsp;my only gripe, is there should of been a extra silver helmet to turn &quot;brown&quot; into the mandorlorian...</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2020-09-23T18:25:12.56Z","Finally , a great non army builder battle pack ","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>This is a great set with fantastic figures based of background characters from the immensely popular show the mandalorian .</p>

<p>Minifigures-</p>

<p>The figures are all unique so starting with the worst fig (brown mandalorian) his helmet is nice and in a dark orange colour , a dark brown cape a printed torso with armour and unfortunately imprinted legs , the light grey nightowl helmet is very nice with an attached range finder , a black cape , a printed dark tan torso and printed sand blue legs , the green nightowl helmet is very nice with another range finder attached , she has a dark brown cape , printed blue torso and printed legs , the best mando has a bright blue helmet , an olive green cape , printed torso and some printed legs . All of the mandos have black heads and stud shooters .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The speeder has some slopes and a forward headlight , dark grey handlebars , a side mounted stud shooter on each side along with a fun on each side , the back has further alternating stripes of light tan and dark tan and a little exhaust tab the very back underneath . The rock formation is on a 6&times;6 plate with a mixture of reddish brown textured bricks and dark grey brick sloped , taller slopes and cheese slopes , there is also a jumper to mount a stud shooter and a clip to hold a stud shooter .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is my second favourite battle pack after 501st it is great and my only complaint is the lack of leg printing on the brown mando but other wise not one to buy loads of but a great one to have one or two of especially if you are building a Nivaro moc great for any star wars fan .</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2021-01-11T15:06:51.317Z","This is the way (to do a great battle pack)","<p>Battle packs are a great way of army building specific and unique types of troopers, but the builds in those sets... they usually suck. The Mandalorian Battle Pack only suffers from this problem with the terrain rubble build, the Minifigs and the speeder bike are both pretty darn cool.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p><b>The Speeder:</b> Now in a battle pack, I&rsquo;d expect a very lame build since the figures take the center stage and are pretty much the reason for the existence of battle packs, what I didn&rsquo;t expect though, is that the speeder is actually a shockingly solid build. The front of the speeder has 2 stud shooters, one on each side, and you know how those work. The seating area can fit a minifigure just fine, and you could have the figure holding on to a handle to drive the vehicle. At the back, a translucent red cone piece is used to show what seems to be exhaust coming out of the speeder. Overall, it&rsquo;s not an amazing build, but it&rsquo;s better than what you&rsquo;d expect from a battle pack build, and for that I like it.</p>

<p><b>The Terrain Rubble:</b> This build is just an area where your figures could use to take cover or attack with their blasters in battle. The design of this uses quite a few 1 by 1 grey cheese slopes to really give off that uneven rocky feel to it, and some brown pieces are used for this build as well, which I guess represents dirt. You could easily place a figure there, and a 1 x 2 jumper is provided so that you could place a stud shooter on there. Overall, I kinda wish that this build was expanded upon or was just something else in general, because just as it is, it doesn&rsquo;t feel like there&rsquo;s a lot for a figure to take cover in a battle with. I know it&rsquo;s a battle pack and the builds can&rsquo;t really be all too elaborate. So bottom line is that it&rsquo;s not horrible, but it isn&rsquo;t good either and it doesn&rsquo;t really add much to the set.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs</h3>

<p><b>Mandalorian Warrior (Grey helmet): </b>Let&rsquo;s start off with the obvious best part of the set, the figures. The legs for this Mandalorian are in sand blue with brown lines on them, which are used as the continuation of a robe on the figure. The torso has silver armor plates with a really nice shine to it and a brown belt that is printed on the back as well. The cape is in black and it uses the old papery style of capes, and I wish it was that newer style fabric material, but oh well. The head is just in plain black which makes sense since the identities of these warriors are meant to be secret, and the other 3 figures use the exact same piece for their head. The helmet (which also has an antenna attached to it) is a unique print that has orange and black printed on the light bluish grey piece, the helmet also has some signs of wear on it, and I really love that detail. Finally, her accessory is a stud shooter, and the other 3 figures have the same accessory as well. Overall, this a fantastic looking figure, Lego put a lot of effort into making the figures in this set look incredible, and I really appreciate that.</p>

<p><b>Mandalorian Warrior (Green Helmet):</b> The next Mandalorian for the set has pretty interesting colors to her and still keeps the design of these warriors fresh. Like the other female warrior of the set, she has the continuation of a robe for her legs, in tan this time. The torso has green armor plates and a dark brown belt that&rsquo;s also printed on the back as well. Her cape is the same cut and material as the other figures, but in dark brown which appears once more in the set with another figure. Lastly, the green helmet (with an antenna attached to it) has silver and medium azure patterns for the printing, and once again, the helmet has signs of wear on it which I just love. Overall, this is another great unique looking minifigure and the colors were very interesting great choices.</p>

<p><b>Mandalorian Warrior (Dark Azure Helmet):</b> This Mandalorian is my favorite figure of the set, mainly for its eye-catching colors. The legs have printing of dark azure armor plates on it which looks good. The torso has dark azure armor plates and a dark brown belt, which were both printed on the back as well. The coloring of the cape is a unique one that&rsquo;s the same cut and material as the others, but it&rsquo;s in olive green here, which is a very interesting color to see it in. Lastly, The helmet is my favorite part of the figure. It&rsquo;s in a dark azure color with a purple and silver pattern design, the combination of azure and purple works surprisingly well here and it makes for a very cool and eye-catching design that I love, and the scratch marks and sign of wear also makes it better. Overall, this is my favorite Mandalorian out of the 4 in the set for its vibrant colors that are added into the mix that make for a really unique and great looking design.</p>

<p><b>Mandalorian Warrior (Dark Orange Helmet):</b> This Mandalorian, while still great in appearance, has one pretty bad flaw to it which makes it my&nbsp;least favorite figure of the set. The problem that I have with the figure is the lack of leg&nbsp;&nbsp;printing, it&rsquo;s just in a plain dark brown, which is really quite unfortunate since so much effort was put into the printing and detailing of the other figures in the set and that effort is just painfully absent here. Once you get past the legs though, the quality of the figure is still on par with the rest of the Mandalorians. The torso has reddish brown armor plates and belt that are continued on the back printing. His cape is in dark brown which was also seen with the green helmet Mandalorian. Lastly, the helmet is in dark orange with a silver and black pattern which is a nice variant for the helmet. Overall, I still like this figure even though it&rsquo;s not as great as the other 3 since the lack of leg detailing really brings this one down quite a bit.</p>

<h3>Value For Money&nbsp;</h3>

<p>The value is... fine. As with most battle packs, it feels like it isn&rsquo;t quite the best value, at least in my opinion that you could feel absolutely free to disagree, but it&rsquo;s definitely better than the majority of Star Wars sets. But I will say that since the figures in the set are so incredible, I&rsquo;d be lying if I didn&rsquo;t say it wasn&rsquo;t a decent price, and that&rsquo;s something I wouldn&rsquo;t say about some other battle packs.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve read my review on Benny&rsquo;s Space Squad, then you know that I personally prefer that set over any SW battle pack, but would having this great Mandalorian Battle Pack in my possession change my opinion? ...No, it would be difficult to top something as special as Benny&rsquo;s Space Squad, but what it is however, is one of the best SW battle packs made to date. How so? The 4 exclusive minifigures are simply phenomenal with their glorious vibrant colors and they&rsquo;re easily some of my favorite Star Wars figures that have come out recently, and the speeder bike build is shockingly good. Sure, I do think this set could&rsquo;ve been better (specifically with the second build and the lack of leg printing on the dark orange helmet Mandalorian), but it&rsquo;s still easy to see why this set gets so much praise from Lego Star Wars fans, it&rsquo;s one of the best sets to come out from the theme in 2020 and as a fan of the Disney+ Mandalorian series, I really like it. I&rsquo;d give this set an 8/10 overall and I highly recommend it for any SW fan.</p>

"Struhadlo","2020-03-22T10:57:18.14Z","Apparently Lego still knows how to make a proper battle pack.","<p>Alright. There probably is not too much of a new light I can shed on this set as there are already plenty of other review that do the job for me. But I am an utter completionist&nbsp;and I would review this set sooner or later anyway. There might be one or two original things I have to say about this set so stay tuned.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>

<p>Going through each and every Mandalorian warrior here would be tedious but there is one huge difference among them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The green and grey/light blue Mandalorians are female. You see their helmets have a wee bit different visors. The straight one is for a male and the one with the curves is for a female.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A very mild spoiler for the 1st season of the show follows.</strong></p>

<p>The heads of the Mandalorians are all black. This little detail makes sense since in the show they are not allowed to take their helmets off in front of another living being. And thusly we never know what their faces look like.</p>

<p><strong>The end of the pesky mildly spoiler-ish section.</strong></p>

<p>The minifigs are usually the driving force behind a good battle pack and in this case Lego did really hit home for the majority of the Lego Star Wars fan base including myself. Each minifig&nbsp;distinctly differs from the other in the print, colour, details and the cape. The prints are magnificent. They are detailed to the pinch and except for hand each body part has one. Armour on each minifig looks battle damaged, bruised and well-worn. Even the helmets have bruises on them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, these minifigs&nbsp;all come with bonus accessories. There are 4 eye shaders and 4 antennas/targeting system/microphones (whatever you imagine them being but I belive in the universe it is the second of these). All of these can be attached to the actual helmets.</p>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>The speeder. The new speeder is pretty bulky little piece of art. The colour theme perfectly fits the whole mood of the show and the set. It has little red thruster at the back and two stud shooters at the front above the small wings. It can seat a Mandalorian&nbsp;minifig with the cape on comfortably.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Rocky .. mountain hiiiiigh .. thing. The little fortress can accommodate one warrior and gives an option for a weapon to get attached to the front so it looks like a little turret. At the back hides a handle for another weapon. If you get a multiple of these sets you can build a bigger fortress. The pieces included do allow that nicely.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>Two stud shooters on the speeder are very well-placed so you can shoot them while holding the speed without the necessity of changing the grip into something unnatural. Unlike in the case of stud shooters carried by the Mandalorian warriors. I really do like stud shooters incorporated into builds of all kinds. But my hatred for stud shooter carried by minifigs instead of blasters is immense. It looks dumb, ugly and ruins the mood and the look of the whole set. And no they do not bring in more playability because shooting them is an&nbsp;awkward process in which you have to hold the minifig down like an idiot or pick it up completely.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>Other than my usual rant about the stud shooters this is a really great step up from the most of the recent battle packs. Four of the same minifigs even when the colour theme varies is the best approach and Lego should realise that. There were times when their battle packs&nbsp;were absolutely stellar and this might be the start of a new and better era for these little convenient army builders.</p>

<h2>Builds</h2>

<p>This set comes with two small&nbsp;builds, they are the speeder and some rocks.</p>

<h3>Rocks</h3>

<p>The small rock place has rocks and a place to put a stud shooter on. You can make one of the minifigs hide behind the rocks.</p>

<h3>Speeder</h3>

<p>The speeder is not that big but you can put a minifig on it. On the front of the speeder it has two stud shooters and I do not like that. On the back it has a little engine but there is not much to say about it.</p>

<h2>Minifigs</h2>

<p>Like most battle packs this set has four minifigs in it. They are a blue mandalorian, a green mandalorian, a grey mandalorian and a brown mandalorian.</p>

<h3>Blue mandalorian</h3>

<p>The blue mandalorian has some purple markings on the helmet. He has a blank black head (all of them do). He has an olive green Cape. He has a nice print for the body. His legs have cool prints on him that match the blue of the helmet and body.</p>

<h3>Green mandalorian</h3>

<p>The green mandalorian has an antenna on her helmet. She has a green helmet with some blue markings on it. She has a blank black head. She has a dark brown cape. She has a cool body that is&nbsp;dark green, and she has dark blue arms. Her legs have a print that looks like cloth.</p>

<h3>Grey mandalorian</h3>

<p>The grey mandalorian has an antenna connected to the helmet. Her helmet has orange markings. She also has a blank black head. She has a black cape. She has a body that is mostly dark tan and it has silver armour&nbsp;on it. Her legs have prints that look like cloth.</p>

<h3>Brown mandalorian</h3>

<p>The brown mandalorian has a dark orange helmet with silver markings on it. This minifig also has a blank black head. He has a dark brown cape. He has a dark brown body print that matches the color of his helmet. His legs are dark brown and have no printing on. I do not like that because all the other ones have printed legs.</p>

<h2>My opinions</h2>

<p>I think this set is fine. This is not the best battle pack because you can not make an army if you buy a bunch of these sets. At the time that this set takes place in the mandalorians all painted their armour differently.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The Minifigures;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; Blue Mando; he wears the traditional Mandolorian helmet. His is blue with dark silver markings and purple battle damage. He wears a sand green stiff cape. His torso is printed with a blue chest armour and a brown belt. His arms are grey with black gloves. His legs have knee armor printed on them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Green Mando; she has a green helmet with light silver and blue markings and has a rangefinder on the side of her helmet. Her torso is dark blue with green chest armor and a brown belt. Her arms are dark blue with brown gloves. Her legs have a dark tan skirt printed on them. She wears a dark brown stiff cape.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Grey Mando; this Mando wears a grey helmet with a rangefinder and has orange and black markings on her helmet as well. She wears a black stiff cape. Her torso is printed with a dark tan vest. That is covered by her grey chest armour. Her arms are sand blue with black gloves. Her pants are sand blue with the same colored skirt printed on them.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Orange Mando; he wears an orange helmet with silver jag eyes and black and silver markings. He wears a dark brown shirt with orangish brown chest armor and a light brown belt. His arms are dark brown with black gloves. He wears a dark brown stiff cape and plain dark brown pants. All the Mando&#39;s have plain black heads and carry stud shooters.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The builds are pretty straightforward and simple. You build a piece of rubble for the Mando&#39;s to take cover behind and place their stud shooters on. Then you build a speeder the speeder is very similar to the speeder in 7914. Just more rustic and a bit more detailed with stud shooters added on.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Overall an excellent LEGO battle pack though not the best set I think for army building but great for filling out your Mandolorian dioramas.</p>

It&#39;s not great for repeat buying because there&#39;s no uniform clothing, like the 2017 rebel battle pack, but it&#39;s a good one time buy. It&#39;s a she none of the mando were actually based off the show, but I think a couple are based off concept art.</p>

<p>The build is very good for a battle pack, and a nice homage to the original mando battle pack, altho the &quot;turrets&quot; a bit lackluster</p>
