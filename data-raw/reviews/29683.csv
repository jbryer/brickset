<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Wedge Antilles is a great minifigure with painting on both sides of the torso and the front of the legs.&nbsp; His helmet has nicely detailed printing and the head has two faces with different expressions.&nbsp; I see in the official Brickset review by CapnRex101 that he says the minifigure is missing some details found onscreen but my opinion is that this is a really good minifigure.</p>

<p>The Snowtrooper minifigure is equally good in my opinion: printing on both sides of the torso and legs.&nbsp; The helmet is the same since 2014 but it&#39;s not broken so don&#39;t fix it.&nbsp; The head only has one facial expression but that&#39;s okay with me.&nbsp; Better than the unprinted black heads of the original troopers.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know why the hands are not white to match the rest of the figure but I&#39;m sure kids won&#39;t care or notice.</p>

<p>I should also note that both minifigs come with actual blasters and not the stupid stud shooters.&nbsp; Yes!</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The box includes two numbered bags with two instruction booklets numbered for each bag so the Snowspeeder is built in book 1 and the rest of the set built in book 2.&nbsp; I thought it should have been one booklet but splitting up the build in two bags is good for the intended audience.</p>

<p>Building the Snowspeeder is quick and easy.&nbsp; It only measures 4.5 inches long by 3.75 wide but it looks proportionally correct and easily identifiable.&nbsp; The printed nose pieces helps a lot.&nbsp; There is also a printed flight control piece in the cockpit.&nbsp; It&#39;s definitely sturdy enough for a child to swoosh around. I&#39;ve purposely dropped it three times and no pieces came off so that&#39;s a grand achievement.&nbsp; For the small size, I like this model.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t build the speeder or &quot;rebel base&quot; turret included in the set because I don&#39;t need another speeder or random disk shooter disguised as ice.&nbsp; ;-)&nbsp; The parts are a nice variety of bricks and other pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Rating</strong></p>

<p>I may be a little generous with an overall rating of 4/5 but I rated the categories based on how much my boys would have enjoyed this set when they were really young.&nbsp; There are bigger, better Lego sets in the world but this has a good spot for the 4+ range.&nbsp; I would definitely recommend this set if you can find it on sale or clearance.</p>
