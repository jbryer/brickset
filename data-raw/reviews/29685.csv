<p>This does not feel like a good value. Vonreg&#39;s TIE (75240) is $10 cheaper and feels like a much better value.</p>

<p>The cockpit/central ball section especially feels cramped, simplified and unimaginative -- like something from a $19.99 kit that was designed with significant part constraints. The stand is super flimsy feeling, although the ship does balance nicely on it. The triangular wing panels are not attached as well to the central ball section as most of the other TIEs I&#39;ve built (which incorporate very strong Technic connections). Instead, these use several two-finger locking hinge clips that remind me of the atrocious clips connections that barely hold the wing panels together on the older TIE Special Forces ship (75101).</p>

<p>The Positives:</p>

<p>The bulk of the bricks in this kit make up the two triangular wing panels, which are sturdy and designed beautifully. I especially like the recessed/hidden triggers for the spring guns. There are a ton of red and black triangular wedges in a couple of sizes, which are useful for other builds. I like the Finn and Knight of Ren&nbsp;minifigures, but the First Order pilot is anonymous and forgettable.</p>

<p>In Short:</p>

<p>I bought this kit for the minifigures and parts. I wish I hadn&#39;t. This is a hard pass at the current price; both Vonreg&#39;s TIE and the Black Ace TIE Interceptor (75242) are way better values for the price and have more playability.</p>

"Struhadlo","2020-03-19T21:34:51.01Z","Why do you hate us Lego?","<p>I have so much to say about this set I have no idea where do I start.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The latest picture in the Star Wars saga has brought us some new interesting designs for a bunch of ships and one of those is for a legendary Tie fighter class and thus Lego has decided to turn in into a play set. And I can honestly say that they tried to make something new and interesting.&nbsp;This is a stellar looking Tie fighter. The shape and the colour scheme work like a well oiled machine. The set comes with two cool minifgs and there is even some playability. But let&#39;s address the elephant in the room.</p>

<p><strong>PRICE</strong></p>

<p>Lego, WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU? 80$ for a 470 pieces set? I know that Tie fighters are usually overpriced, but this one just takes the cake. The case could be made that Lego did throw in an exclusive figure and a somewhat exclusive figure. Furthermore, there are few new parts made just for this set. But nah, that ain&#39;t gonna do it for me. And I suppose for pretty much everyone else, since the set has been on&nbsp;at least 20% discount in great many stores since the day of its release. This time Lego did really went balls to the wall with the price and there is really no good reason to take their side this time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And honestly, large reason why this set gets such a poor rating is because of the price and the price alone. Cause other than that the set is pretty rad.</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Trudgen. Finally, I have a place to flex with my knowledge of these cool ghoulish dark side warriors. Jokes aside, our beloved Death Trooper slayer has a gorgeously detailed torso print. The legs with the cap are fine and the head is again brilliant. I would normally call this a minor complaint but since I am still in the heat from my pricing rant I will give this set no rest when it comes to its demerits no matter how insignificant they may be. Instead of giving us an exclusive sword mold&nbsp;we get a regular Uruk-Hai machete. Which would be completely fine but..</li>
	<li>Tie Pilot. I suppose this is a standard torso and leg printing for an Imperial pilot but I still find it rather detailed and nicely finished. The helmet has a rubber pipe if you will which ends just in the middle of the torso and gives the minifig even better look. Lego is kinda lazy&nbsp;usually and gives an angry clone head to the most Imperial/First Order minifigs even though they are no clones.</li>
	<li>TRAITOR! Finn. My boy Boyega&nbsp;has been done dirty by the movies, but not by Lego. He comes with an&nbsp;accurate looking torso and leg print with several pockets and two belts. One is a waist print and the second is under the vest. The back looks dull but it makes sense in the context of what he is wearing.&nbsp; One of his facial&nbsp;expressions is thrilled about a man purse he carries around. His other facial expression is horrified over how difficult is to put the man purse on and off without having to unplug the head. One last detail is what I belive to be&nbsp;a new hair piece&nbsp;which is even more detailed than the previous one. I do not understand the reasoning behind putting Finn into this set. It makes no sense movie wise and it makes no sense logic wise. What kind of an opposition is one lonely traitor against a Tie fighter and a member of the Knights of Ren? Instead of Finn there should be one or two Sith Troopers in my opinion.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>Obviously the most pronounced feature of this&nbsp;whole ship are the wings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The double layered wings in black with the red edges do look incredibly menacing. Their mean look is even more amplified by the aggressive triangular shaping and the red cockpit glass. These cool features are unfortunately undermined by the light grey fuselage. I know this is how the vehicle looks like in the universe but Lego could have done a little compromise and use a darker shade of grey. Perhaps the did try that and it did not look as good I think it would. But the final product looks little bit whimsical because of this drawback.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fuselage does not consist of many pieces since the already weak piece count is drained by the wings and thusly it looks think and little cheap.&nbsp;</p>

<p>From the front the ship looks perfect and ready to be put on a display. But heed the warning and do not turn the ship around. As the back side looks awkward, bulky and the design does not work here. Again, the light grey against the sharp black red duo looks really dumb.</p>

<p>The cockpit can fit one&nbsp;minifig rather uncomfortably and there are no control handles inside. The whole cockpit area is small but it has two printed panels on each side.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks to the shaping of the wings this model cannot stand on its own and needs a stand which is a part of the set. Here I have to applaud the designers of this model, since they found a smart way to incorporate a place on the ship which can connect with the stand. You see, those teeth at the front of the fuselage are faithfully accurate to what the ship looks like&nbsp;in the movie. And trust me, balancing a ship on a stand is a nightmare sometimes. Especially with the shape such as this.</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>There are two spring-loaded shooters incorporated into the second layer of the wings. Each wing has one and the shooting mechanism is designed to be nicely hidden in the body of the wings. The problem comes after you press these little one on two plates in order to fire the missiles. Then you have to pull them out and with the very little space given you will find yourself loathing the decision of firing them in the first place. Cool looking design but a terribly dysfunctional one.</p>

<p>Other than that there is not much playability to this set. You can open the cockpit and put a minifig inside and that is about that.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>I like this ship I really do. But the price and lack of content renders me unable to give this a nice rating. If this was a 60$&nbsp;set it would be an easy 3&nbsp;out of 5 but given the price and thus&nbsp;amplified shortcomings of this set I am left with no other option. And again I do like the ship but there has to be a loud and strong feedback for Lego to hear that they did cross a line here.</p>

"HandPositions","2020-05-07T21:24:51.483Z","Sith TIE Fighter: Better Than It Seems","<p>The Sith TIE Fighter is an $80 2020-Star Wars set based on the ninth film, The Rise of Skywalker. With 470 pieces, its $80 price per piece does not seem very satisfactory. Many consider it not a worthy purchase. However, I have seen many more positive than negative qualities about this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigures provided in this set are Finn, a First Order TIE Pilot, and a Knight of Ren. This selection is perfect for a set of this value. The Finn minifigure has a hair piece used for the second time since 2019, first appearing in The Millennium Falcon, a set in the first wave based after&nbsp;The Rise of Skywalker. He has a metallic-coloured blaster and a reddish brown satchel. The jacket printing is nice as well. The First Order TIE Pilot is as it is in the First Order TIE Fighter microfighter from early 2018, with an added stripe on a helmet. This minifigure also includes a black blaster pistol and&nbsp;is used as the pilot for the ship. Finally, there is a Knight of Ren minifigure, exclusive to this set. The minifigure has metallic colouring and printing on its otherwise grey and black outfit, with a single-sided face and a draped hat. This minifigure includes a metallic blade piece and is a nice exclusive minifigure for the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing that I appreciate about this set is its inclusion of green spring-loaded shooter ammo elements instead of the red ones seen in earlier TIE fighter renditions. It includes one extra as well, as always, in case one is lost due to accidental firing. The set is $80, and thus qualifies for a brick separator. The one included is orange, unlike the turquoise edition which has been popping up, and has been included in another set of its wave, Poe Dameron&#39;s X-Wing Fighter. The stand included, as I can tell, is required for the stability of the set. However basic the stand build is, it is vital. Otherwise, the fighter is forced to face slightly downwards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cockpit of the Sith TIE Fighter has a red, custom-printed front viewing window, along with the well-known roof window. Although it is smaller than most TIE Fighter cockpits, it includes a stunning feature that no LEGO TIE Fighter has included before: the 4 3x3 dome pieces on the back. These pieces have been used in several MOCs of TIE Fighters and greatly enhance their round shape. On the interior, there is enough space to seat the TIE Pilot. The cockpit has 4x4 wing plates jutting out of the front to allow it to connect to the included stand. One thing I consider astounding about the cockpit is that it does not include a single Technic element. There are no beams or pins in the build, and it is still perfectly stable and connected.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wings, the most iconic part of this TIE variant, are triangularly shaped. Some people actually have nicknamed it the &ldquo;TIE Dorito&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dorito TIE Fighter&rdquo;. This set is the second built TIE Fighter with the relatively new 4x6 wing elements in red and black. It uses transparent 1x4 pieces to connect and stabilise the streamlined grey detailing on the back of the wings. The top layer of the wings is connected to the base by a set of dark stone grey bricks, which are barely visible. This creates a nice, shadowy effect that looks perfect with the ship. The only negative thing about the wings is the page usage on the instructions. Each wing is a separate set of pages, because they are not symmetrical. I would suggest building the base of both wings as a 2x feature in the instructions, and then adding the top individually to each one. Otherwise, the set is in perfect shape.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reason many people do not enjoy this set is the price. At $80, it seems a bit overpriced, as the average price per piece for a set tends to be around 10&cent;. Many say the set should be around $50. However, as we have assumed by their rarity, the Knights of Ren are very valuable minifigures. This set is actually cheap for a minifigure of that variety, as Kylo Ren&#39;s Shuttle and Poe Dameron&#39;s X -Wing, two additional sets with Knights of Ren, are more expensive, retailing at $90 and $130. This is the least expensive set with a Knight of Ren minifigure in it, although in August, LEGO is rumoured to be creating a Night Buzzard set with the two remaining Knights for only $70.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion, I see no reason that the Sith TIE Fighter set should be considered a bad set. With three great minifigures, a display stand, and many other features, this set is great for a LEGO collection, especially for those collecting a First Order army.</p>

"TheBrickDudeStudios","2020-07-06T19:07:49.807Z","Not the best set.","<p>This set comes with a Tie Dagger,&nbsp;first order pilot, A knight of Ren,&nbsp;Finn and a stand for the Tie Dagger. This set has a new print on the window on the front of the ship and a new mold for the tip of the wings. Now for my opinions. This is a bad set. The wings always come off even if I just tap it. I like the colors of this set but I don&#39;t like anything else agout this ship. It comes with a First Order pilot even though this ship is A Final Order ship.&nbsp;You should not buy this set.</p>

"lukaszsw","2021-01-07T13:32:56.227Z","Excellent new Tie variant","<p>The Lego Sith Tie Fighter looks great and feels great. Even though it is quite expensive, I would recommend it fully.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Compared to other Ties (like&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75240-1/Major-Vonreg-s-TIE-Fighter"">Vonreg&#39;s Tie</a>) it is quite large, which is also reflected in weight. The cost is similar though.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some video reviews suggest it is front heavy. It is a little, that is why it is mounted on the stand in line with front hatch. It doesn&#39;t really impact play unless you are a very young child. A 7 year old should have no problem with it. Adult should hardly notice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One downside is that it only has 3 figures. Other Ties have 4 mini figures and it seems there should be a Sith trooper present here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Spring-loaded shooters are concealed in wings. It makes for a clean design but perhaps it is a little hard to reach even with two hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall I rate this model highly compared to other space ships in Lego Star Wars line.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To sum up</p>

<ul>
	<li>(+) Great original shape&nbsp;</li>
	<li>(+) Good weight and volume (size to price ratio)</li>
	<li>(+) Hidden spring-loaded shooters</li>
	<li>(+) A stand&nbsp;</li>
	<li>(-) Lacks Sith Trooper mini figure, usually there are 4 with a Tie or an X-wing</li>

<p>Build: it looks good. The red trim makes really finishes the look for me, it&#39;s a shame this ship wasn&#39;t as prominent in the film.</p>

<p>figs:the knight of ren is probably the most boring one, but it is still a knight of ren. Finn looks great, but he could&#39;ve done with a more serious face. The TIE Pilot is just a TIE Pilot</p>
