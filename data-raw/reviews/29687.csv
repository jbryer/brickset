"Windsorlego","2019-12-31T10:16:58.98Z","Fun Brick to Make","<p>I bought this set out of curiousity more than for any other reason. Despite the fact there are only 72 pieces in this set I enjoyed making it.</p>

<p>It is not particularly difficult to put together and won&#39;t take all that long to do. If you decide to make more of these in either a solid colour&nbsp;or multi-colour, be aware that you won&#39;t be able to put them together like you would with standard bricks.&nbsp; This is purely for display only which is why there is a stand provided.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to have some fun making more of this set most likely as multi-coloured rather than solid coloured.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>As there doesn&#39;t appear to be a parts list available I have provided one below showing number required, part and part number:-</p>

<p>RED BRICK</p>

<p>Four 6x6 plates - 3958</p>

<p>Two 1x10&nbsp;plates - 4477</p>

<p>Two 1x10&nbsp;bricks - 6111</p>
