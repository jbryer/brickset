"chefkaspa","2019-12-27T15:53:10.457Z","Good handful","<p>This is &#39;my&#39; version of mini Claas set because I built it from spare parts back in November using the published images (and blueprint).</p>

<p>Only rare parts are the red wheel rims and the 5L half beams that hold the attachment.</p>

<p><img alt=""handful"" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42102/001_wrn_191120_160618.png"" style=""width: 640px; height: 471px;"" /></p>

<p>Can&#39;t comment on the building process because of lack of instruction. Mine came together quite nicely. In the end you&#39;ll have a good hand full of model (see picture).<br />
The odd angle of front cabin window and hood is achieved by a single connecting point to the roof. Therefore you may notice different (relative) angles in photos of the model.</p>

<p>There are three functions realised in this model:<br />
- Steering<br />
- Raise/Lowering of the attached tool<br />
- Rotation from rear axle to the tool (can&#39;t decide whether this would be o mower or hay rake)</p>

<p>Steering transmission is done by three horizontal 16tooth gears. The setup is only 3 studs wide but work fine for this model.</p>

<p>The attachment is driven from the rear axle making good use of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-61904"">block</a> that is known from the big linear actuator. The connection remains if the tool is lifted from the ground. Note that there is no supporting wheel. You have to adjust the height by hand and guessing.</p>

<p>I do not like the rear axle of the tractor: Both wheels are using the same (7L) axle. Therefore you will notice considerable resistance if the tractor is pushed in curves (obvious at least on flat surfaces). As the rear wheels are moving on circles of different diameter they would need to move at different speed. Bigger models have separate axles or even differential(s).</p>

<p>An improvement can be implemented with slight modification. I found it necessary (and feasible) to reinforce rear wheel suspension. Therefore 4L half beams are added as supports:</p>

<p>The 7L axle is replaced by two <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-6587"">3L studded axles</a> that are pushed first through the wheel and then fixed inside the chassis:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.brickshelf.com/gallery/rothw/technic/42102/032_wrn_191120_160811.png"" /></p>

<p>For me this modification improved playability a lot.</p>

"welociraptor_28","2020-03-19T19:35:08.55Z","It's one of the best small technic sets ever!","<p>I bought this set recently in a store, and I&#39;m very happy with this purchase!</p>

<h3>Box and instructions</h3>

<p>The box is of course small, it has very nice artwork on the front and on the back we can see the second or &quot;B&quot; model. The instructions are small, but surprisingly thick (55 pages, 49 are actual instructions, the rest are ads, lists of parts and other stuff).</p>

<h3>Building experience</h3>

<p>The building process took me about half an hour mostly because I&#39;m not great with technic sets. I made 2 mistakes: I stuck an axle in the wrong place, <span class=""tlid-translation translation"" lang=""en""><span title="""">which meant that the wheels could not rotate</span></span>; the second thing I did is I put the &quot;Cross Block 3M&quot; piece backwards, and the effect was that I couldn&#39;t raise up the red thing in the back. The stickers weren&#39;t a problem.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Most of the parts in this set are very common. There are a few rare parts, but none of them are unique to this set. Most noticeable are the wheels, which aren&#39;t actually new. Here they have a new number, but they appear in 3 other sets. Same with other &quot;unique&quot; parts, still, they are not that common.</p>

<h3>Complete model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks great, may I say cute, but I have one gripe with it. From the side it looks... empty? Of course that&#39;s not a big problem, you rarely see it from the side, and seeing how it was built, there is nothing you can do about it. But apart from that, it really does look great. The lime-green, white and red combination is perfect and it really stands out.</p>

<h3>Playability</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The model has two functions. First is the &quot;hand of God steering&quot;, controlled with the black knob on the roof. It&#39;s an interesting technique and it works pretty well. One problem is that trying to steer and reverse is harder than it should be, the model looses traction.</p>

<p>The second function is the attachment on the back. The black wheels turn with the back axle. The rear attachment also can be lowered or elevated. It&#39;s pretty fun and it works without any problems.</p>

<h3>Value for money</h3>

<p>It really is worth those 8 &ndash; 12&euro;.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a great set, with great value, looks and playability! As I said at the beggining, it&#39;s one of the best small technic sets. I recommend it 100%!</p>

"silvioreis","2021-07-14T14:59:51.107Z","Lots of gears","<p>I bought this set&nbsp;to my 8year&#39;s old son because he is addicted to follow Lego&#39;s instructions from page 1 to the end of booklet.</p>

<p>It is hard enough for kids of his age, I think, and he made a lot of mistakes and ask me help to fix it, but I expected that and love this kind of interaction. I had to give him some clues, and it was enough to him figure out how to fix it by himself, but I think this set is a bit difficult to kids below 10y, so be patient to help your child with it.</p>

<p>This set has a lot of gears and movable parts and is a &ldquo;must-have&rdquo; set to kids and AFOL that love build alternative MOC&nbsp;or just what your imagination dictated.</p>

<p>I must admit that I bought 2 set of it just for the extra&nbsp;gears, but my fascination for trucks, tractors and all kinds of construction vehicles hooked me very deep!<br />

"MartinT","2020-08-21T23:05:22.643Z","A cheap Technic set with god design and a lot of moving gears","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Function (gears)</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">What I liked about this set is all the different gears. Nine gears to be precise. To get so many in a small and cheap set is amazing. The steering uses three &ldquo;Gear Wheel Z16&rdquo; just to extend the connection point. The rear attachment uses two &ldquo;Double Conical Wheel Z36&rdquo;, connected by a &ldquo;Double Conical Wheel Z12 1M&rdquo; for &ldquo;cutting&rdquo; the harvest. This is driven by the rear wheels. That connection uses a &ldquo;Double Conical Wheel Z12 1M&rdquo;, &ldquo;Conical Wheel Z12&rdquo; and a &ldquo;Bevel Gear Z20&rdquo;. These gears sit in a &ldquo;Block3X4X2&rdquo;. This is a nice way to learn how gears work with other gears. It is also nice to see these gears move when you turn the tractor upside down and move the wheels.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Design</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The tractor looks nice with the three different colors. The shape of the tractor is very good. The hood looks right, and the slope shape of the front of the cabin is a smart design. The grey bush between the wheels looks like a step for getting in the cabin.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The new box art is so much better than the old. Now we have a full-size picture of the set and the background, covering the whole front. The old had a black bar on the side and on the bottom. This is removed in the new one.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Two different models to build</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Model A is a tractor for cutting and therefor the attachment is in the rear. Model B is a harvester for gathering the harvest from the model A and therefor the attachment is in the front. Therefor the model A can look similar to the model B. It is basically the same thing expect the cabin is turn 180. Also, the model A has the steering in the front and model B has it in the back.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Summary</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This Technic set is cheap but has amazing design and functions. The moving gears is a great way to learn about how gears work. This set is also a 2 in 1. They look the same, but model A is a tractor and model B is harvester. This set is my favorite cheap set, because of the gears and the design.</p>

"Hitscan","2020-08-14T18:57:13.59Z","Simply Perfect","<p>This is the set that got me into Technic. I&#39;d recommend it to&nbsp;anyone who&#39;s never bought a Technic set before&nbsp;because it does pretty much everything right.</p>

<p>As small as it is, the XERION is accurate to its real-life counterpart, an impressive feat considering that LEGO has never made a Technic set at this scale&nbsp;based on a brand name vehicle.</p>

<p>The CLAAS XERION is compact, and although none of its&nbsp;three functions are complex, they work smoothly and&nbsp;make the set&nbsp;worth every penny.</p>
