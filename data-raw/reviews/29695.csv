"Aussielegofan98","2020-10-09T04:38:23.85Z","Pretty Good","<p>The Townhouse Toy Store is the Creator 3 in 1 building set for 2020 and I&#39;m pleased to say this is quite a good set.&nbsp;The price is reasonable, even here in Australia, and I&nbsp;was lucky to pick it&nbsp;up on sale at Big W for just $44. The finished product is quite good-looking (I highly recommend building the main model) and will be a perfect addition to any LEGO town or city. It is especially great for anyone who would like some more buildings in their town but don&#39;t have the space and/or cash for the modulars. The detail is definitely better than your standard LEGO CITY buildings and will not look too out of place when displayed in proximity to the modular buildings. The bottom floor serves as a toy store while the top floor features a small townhouse apartment including a bed. Two minifigures are included with the set, one of them wearing an official LEGO branded shirt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are just a few minor&nbsp;things that could be improved with this set:</p>

<ul>
	<li>No stairs to access the top level. Most multi-level Creator buildings usually include some access to the top level, whether it be through stairs or a ladder. In this case you&#39;ll just have to use your imagination (or customise it and include your own stairs).&nbsp;</li>
	<li>It&#39;s open at the back. I know it is to save parts (and money) but given the Creator sets are of a higher&nbsp;level of realism than the CITY ones it would be nice to have a fully enclosed building.</li>
	<li>Possibly the inclusion of 1 more minifigure.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall, this is a good set and I highly recommend it to anyone, regardless of whether your LEGO City is small or large. This is a 3 in 1 set and the alternate models are also quite nice, but I would definitely&nbsp;recommend building the main one.&nbsp;</p>

"BrickRandom","2021-01-31T18:43:15.2Z","Nice little shops","<p>The Townhouse Toy Store is a nice 3-in1 Creator set. The instruction booklet contains instructions for three models for the 554 piece set.</p>

<h3>&nbsp;</h3>

<h3>Main model</h3>

<p>The main model is the toy store. It takes about 50 minutes to build this model. It is a nice two-storey building, with the ground floor being the actual store (as is to be expected). The building techniques do not seem very spectacular, but they do manage to create a lot of fun architectural details. I particularly like the round &#39;tower&#39; and the use of the rounded 1x2 plate to create a half stud offset on things like columns and planters.</p>

<p>The model is filled with lovely details, like all the toys and the candy machine. The top floor is a little apartment, furnished with a bed and some plants.</p>

<p>As a bonus, the set also included a little ride that actually functions. Rotating the technic gear causes the spaceship to rock back and forth!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Alternate models</h3>

<p>The second model takes about 40 minutes to build. After building the one-storey building, about 150 parts of the set are left over. Initially, I thought I was building a flower shop, but by the end of the build it is clearly a bakery. Next to the bakery is a small room for the child to build its LEGO sets. The shop is quite cramped, but overall a nice build. My favourite detail of this build was the lamppost.</p>

<p>The third model is another one-storey building and takes about 35 minutes to build. It leaves about 175 parts unused. This one is actually a flower shop and a very effective one at that. Being only one room, it is not so cramped as the bakery. Very nice&nbsp;feature of this build is the skylight.&nbsp;Of the two alternate models, this one is definitely my favourite.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The set contains a nice number of tan and medium azure parts, as well as two doors and plenty&nbsp;of windows. It also has three tiles printed as LEGO sets, which I was quite happy to get. A&nbsp;lot of useful parts in my opinion and two nice minifigures.</p>

<p>Also a positive note in my book: no strickers in this set.</p>

<p>My favourite part is the 1x3x3 window frame. I didn&#39;t know this part existed, so it was a nice surprise halfway through the build!</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The main build and the two alternate models are all rather nice builds. Most of all, they make we want to build more in this &#39;mini modular&#39; style. There&#39;s a good selection of useful parts as well.</p>

<p>Brickset has the RRP listed as &euro; 50. Despite all the positive points, I think that is a bit much for this set. Luckily, my country&#39;s LEGO site has this listed at &euro; 40 and, on top of that, finding a 20% discount on this set isn&#39;t hard. At a price of &euro; 32 (or even a few euros more), I would highly recommend this set!</p>

The rocket ride has a turning mechanism like the one on set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40335-1/Space-Rocket-Ride"" tabindex=""0"">40335 - Space Rocket Ride</a> that will make the ride to go up and down.

<p>The front side of the first floor of this toy store is decorated with a toy train, a nutcracker soldier statue, gumball machine street light to help illuminate the display window.

<p>The second level of this store is probably used by the female storekeeper. The room has a large bed and various decoration such as drawer, flower vases and light stand. This floor also has a balcony for the storekeeper to get a fresh air and enjoy a clear weather.

<p>Like the usual LEGO&reg; Creator 3 in 1 set, there are two more models that can be constructed from this set, but for this review, I&nbsp;only built the main model because it is the most interesting and use the most part. What do you think of this set? Leave us your comment below!</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>More store for City diorama is welcome! The design of this classical style building is astounding and the colour combination is to my liking.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>As a Creator 3 in 1 set, it should be fully enclosed shop for more realism. I wonder why LEGO do not make a full enclosed Creator 3 in 1 shops any more and instead making CITY or FRIENDS like shops.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Both adult and children will enjoy this set Children will have fun with the rocket ride.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>This is a great set for its price. Getting it at discounted price is even better!</p>

<p><strong>Special Note</strong></p>

<p>This set can be combined with Creator 3 in 1&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/31097-1/Townhouse-Pet-Shop-Caf%C3%A9"">31097 - Townhouse Pet Shop &amp; Cafe</a>&nbsp;and with a little modification can be placed together side by side.&nbsp;</p>

"elbigdaddy101","2021-11-15T15:54:24.33Z","Perfect for people who like creator expert, but are poor - Townhouse Toy Store","<p>&nbsp;First, this set is a great deal at just 0.07 PPP (price per piece.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Display and Appearance</p>

<p>This set is perfect for display because of its realistic design and bright colours. The indoor layout felt like a real LEGO store, with things on the walls and things being displayed in a window. The flat above also had a wonderful design on the outside with what seems like Victorian architecture.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mini figures</p>

<p>This is a creator set, so you should never expect anything really cool for the mini-figures. However, what you do not see on the box is that the yellow torso piece has a LEGO logo on the back.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Customization</p>

<p>There are some fun customization aspects to this set. I had a lot of fun trying to make new designs for the vehicles in the window. I also changed the design for the ride outside and motorized it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>Overall this is a great set for a great price at just 39.99 for 554 pieces. In my opinion, this Is good for 8-10 y.o.&#39;s who love LEGO.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for reading,</p>
