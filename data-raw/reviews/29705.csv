<p>I had high hopes for this one, I would&#39;ve bought more if it&#39;d been good. It is not, oh how badly it is not. Maybe the other builds are fine, but I got it for the dragon and as a dragon, just no.</p>

<p>ball joints on the wings - stupid</p>

<p>claws on the feet don&#39;t reach the ground - stupid</p>

<p>feet you can twist 360&#39; - stupid</p>

<p>ankles you can twist 360&#39; - stupid</p>

<p>legs you can twist 360&#39; - stupid.</p>

<p>only two claws on the arms so you can&#39;t grip anything - stupid.</p>

<p>black technic pieces on the legs so you can see right through them - stupid.</p>

<p>all in all, it&#39;s a set I&#39;d rather donate to charity than have on display.</p>

<p>Go for the 31032, even if it&#39;s more expensive, which it probably will be, what with it being older and possibly discontinued, but if you&#39;re buying one dragon, don&#39;t let this one be it.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know if anyone understands&nbsp;what i just wrote but l will begin with the scorpion</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The scorpion is ok but i don&#39;t really like the almost immovable legs, they&#39;re still pretty good considering the pieces used. The stinger is a bit heavy but is a good counterweight for the claws(i think) witch i really like because they can open and close.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The sabertooth tiger</p>

<p>I&#39;m a bit mixed about the sabertooth. The legs are really greatly designed as well as the body but the tail is maybe a bit small? I really like the head design,&nbsp;but the mouth is hollow on the side even if it is closed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>And finally, the fire dragon</p>

<p>The dragon is the main build and rightfully so. the tail of the dragon has only one ball joint but is really movable because of its design. i really like the design&nbsp;of the wings having a ball joint each to make the wings bend in the&nbsp;middle. the legs are fairly standard but the feet(?) and claws can move with the help of a technic pin witch makes it more posable.&nbsp; The dragon head is nicely designed. The treasure chest is good use of parts and you can even put treasure in it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>i really like this set because it is good on its own, and with other sets like the castle line.</p>
