<p>As you can clearly see from the official images, the minifigure is unable to actually sit in the vehicle, the best they can do is to sit on the car bonnet. Not quite the usual image one would expect from law enforcement. The other drawback to contemporary eyes is the use of stickers - a good idea in theory, but they rarely stay in place neatly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the plus side, we were impressed at the time by the clear blue siren cylindrical block. And with a bit of creativity (and maybe a few additional bricks) it was possible to make a slightly longer vehicle which did give the minifigure a place to sit and &#39;drive&#39; the car.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall though, it&#39;s clear that this is a stepping stone to greater things as the worlds of Minifigures developed. But at the time, there was still some way to go.</p>
