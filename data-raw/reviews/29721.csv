<p>First, let me say that I am so far from the target audience for this set it&#39;s unreal, but in the spirit of watching &#39;My Little Pony&#39; on a Sunday morning, let&#39;s continue to review it in a properly grown-up fashion!</p>

<p>It&#39;s a colourful selection of parts with a generous set of the new micro-dolls and Ariel&#39;s friends. There are plenty of things for the little ones to role-play with both under the sea and on the shore. The book-like case makes it easy to put away at bedtime or to be a self-contained and portable toy to take when visiting family or away on holiday. And for a LEGO builder of any age or gender, the parts are a treasure-trove Ariel herself would be proud of.</p>

<h3>Characters</h3>

<p>The most striking part of this set are the two tiny dolls for Ariel; one as a mermaid and the other in the pink dress she wears to dinner at the Castle. The two facial expressions are very cute and the heads are interchangeable with regular Friends and Disney mini-dolls. The two red hairpieces are both the same; the soft Friends type with pin-holes for accessories (a pink flower or two are included).</p>

<p>The micro-dolls arms don&#39;t move, but their hands have a small hole that can also hold these Friends decorative pin-on accessories.</p>

<p>Prince Eric wears his white sailing shirt and red cummerbund. His hairpiece comes in two colours - note the black hair on the figure, and the dark grey on the statue in the grotto.</p>

<p>Lastly both Flounder and Sebastian appear as custom-moulded printed parts. Like the micro-dolls, they can both sit on a stud, and Sebastian can hold any regular minifigure accessory or bar in his claws.</p>

<h3>Decoration</h3>

<p>A large gold oval piece, decorated with the silhouette of the little mermaid with gold highlights, is placed on studs on the cover of the book. The covers have a ridge around the edge the same height as the studs (so it can rest flat on a surface) and have more studs in the corners.</p>

<p>Inside, on one half, a light tan sandbar is printed around the 2x4 studs in the centre. There are also more studs in the corners of the interior. The book is held closed with a gold hinged panel piece printed with a small keyhole.</p>

<p>Unusually for LEGO, this set comes with two sticker sheets. One has two stickers for the spine of the book; firstly a silhouette of the little mermaid, and secondly one with space for a child to write their name on.</p>

<p>The second sticker sheet contains all the little fish, musical notes and other creatures that can be seen decorating the set in the pictures above. These could be applied anywhere, or on anything your child wants to decorate with them.</p>

<h3>Build</h3>

<p>The case is a neat LEGO-ised take on the pop-up-book. The base for the build consists of two halves of a large hollowed-out book in medium azure. The spine is in bright bluish-green, and four gold technic pins are pushed in to hold it all together.</p>

<p>The build in the centre represents a mish-mash of scenes from the animated film and other playable features. Ariel&#39;s undersea grotto is represented by the bright coral frond, a simple brick-built statue of Prince Eric, and several gold bars. The lustrous coral-pink seashells and printed musical tile represent Ariel&#39;s (missed) appearance at Sebastian&#39;s introductory concert, and the arch gives somewhere for the little boat from later in the story to sail through. Added to that, there&#39;s a slide for the figures to play on.</p>

<p>King Triton is absent, but his gold trident is present. Other decorations include a bright reddish-violet (magenta) leaf frond, small orange leaf-plates, a gold star(-fish) and white curly ice cream whips.</p>

<p>The main structures are built on three separate small plates, so can be swapped around or placed anywhere for play. But if all three are fitted in line on the spine then the two halves of the book can be closed around them. If all the figures are placed either on the scenery or the round tiles in the corner, then the whole thing closes up with none of them loose inside.</p>

<p>The only thing I think is slightly flawed is closing the clasp on the single stud on the round tile is fiddly for a child - it would be more sensible to just close it on a 2x2 studded plate.</p>

<p>The construction can be a bit fiddly for the very young - your child may need some assistance aligning the parts of the case to get those technic pins in, or putting the smaller pieces together. And with building arched structures there&#39;s always the frustration of pressing too hard and it coming apart before it&#39;s finished. But experienced LEGO builders should have no problems.</p>

<p>And now over now to the Technic builders to build a motorised pop-up book that opens and closes on its own. Or how about a Myst linking book, or one where the act of opening it drives an animating mechanism inside?</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>With any set that has such big moulded custom pieces, one always wonders if it offers good value. In this case, I think it does, and LEGO have got the balance just right.</p>

<p>For a start, a child could build anything they want into this book, and if they learn to keep it narrow enough so the book can still close, then they&#39;ve learnt a great lesson in spatial planning at an early age!</p>

<p>Secondly, do those big pieces detract from the overall content? Well, there aren&#39;t all that many actual bricks in the set, but the parts you get are varied, brightly coloured, and will readily add decoration to any other build. In this set they&#39;re cleverly used to maximise the play potential, so I&#39;d say yes, they&#39;re worth it.</p>

<p>Thirdly, on the matter of figures, is it worth it? Three figures (three-and-a-half including the statue) plus aquatic animal friends are a definite yes.</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>Overall, a charming set with plenty to play with, a generous set of figures, decorative parts that would be a great addition to any collection (including the book itself) and a pretty good price tag overall. And the way it closes up like a storybook is handy both to put it away at the end of the day or travel with.</p>

<p>And for AFOLs there&#39;s always the challenge of making a more detailed or animated display with either the book itself or any of the scenes and figures represented.</p>
