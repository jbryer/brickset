<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">My favorite Disney Princess movie is definitely Beauty and the Beast, the tale as old as time. This Lego set is more recent, though. I wonder if this set will stand the test of time like its predecessor. </span></span></p>

<h3 style=""margin-top:19px; margin-bottom:6px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Minifigures</span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">I like the disproportionate representation of Beauty and the Beast in this set. Beast has an appropriately dapper suit, befitting the ballroom scene. His oversized head is well-molded and opaquely printed. His alternate hair piece is also crisply detailed with several, fine lines.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Beauty (Belle) is quite stunning in her gold and yellow dress. The printing is simple, but effective. Her head and hair piece return from the past. However, they were already accurate and did not need to be updated. I am pleased with their return.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">I was disappointed to not see Lumiere in this set. Thankfully, his good friend Cogsworth is here and maintains distinction throughout the facial printing. Madame de Garderobe is similarly portrayed, albeit larger. Nonetheless, the best servants are undoubtedly Mrs. Potts and Chip. They both have exquisite prints, even down to Chip&rsquo;s chip.</span></span></p>

<h3 style=""margin-top:19px; margin-bottom:6px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Completed Model</span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The pop-up aspect of this set has not hindered the designer. The castle fits comfortably and is completely printed except for the stained glass window. The symmetrical model is no less eloquent than the previous renditions. Gold spires, cups, and a flag at the top add welcome flourishes to the build. I appreciate the round jumper tiles on top where Beauty and the Beast could stargaze if wanted. The front bridge lines up with the archway well and is very stable. The plant life is harmoniously depicted by Lego pieces and printing.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Inside the castle, furniture is sparse. A bust for the Prince Adam hairpiece is plain, but rather necessary. The turntable in the center is adequate to reconstruct the ballroom scene. However, the magical rose certainly takes the cake. Its printing stands out on the transparent brick. I do not know why a brick was used instead of a more faithful dome. Yet, recreating the rose is already hard enough at this scale. I think the large quantity of stickers, especially in the back section of the model, is superfluous and I would leave them off of the model entirely.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The book is cleverly constructed and could easily be used for other purposes. I like the huge printed tile on the front cover depicting Belle. The engraving on the binding, exerting Lego as the publisher, is also a neat touch. I would have liked to see something more for the back cover.</span></span></p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Finally, the simple latch closes the set for transport with a lovely printed plate, just right for it.</span></span></p>

<h3 style=""margin-top:19px; margin-bottom:6px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Overall</span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The confined space of the book has not prevented the important aspects of this set from being included. My main complaint is the abundance of stickers and lack of Lumiere. Therefore, I would recommend this set, both for those who like to play </span></span><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:italic"">and</span></span><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal""> those who like display pieces.</span></span></p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-30T23:20:25.443Z","Somewhat disappointing, but decent idea.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #43177 Belle&rsquo;s Storybook Adventure:</b> In 2020 LEGO introduced a new form of Mini-Doll and a new type of buildable playset. In the vein of Polly Pocket and other similar smaller sized playset type sets comes the Storybook sets of LEGO Disney. Focusing on a single Princess character, each set includes a large clam-shell style pair of elements sculpted in the shape of a book and brand new Micro-Dolls. Smaller, child-sized Mini-Dolls with limited poseability.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Sealed in a LEGO box designed to accommodate shelf space effectively, this box design shows a picture of the animated Princess in the bottom corner with the Disney Princess logo, and shows the set in its open and closed state to get an understanding of what you are purchasing. On the back we have some call outs to scenes from the movie recaptured in LEGO form alongside a very nice shot from the animated feature. It also demonstrates how to open the book and show off the other sets in the range.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual for this set is a bit less impressive. It is a massive let down compared to past LEGO Disney inspired sets, especially for a boxed set. Instead of an actual booklet you will find a small fold-open pamphlet style instruction manual similar to Polybags. This shows the detailed builds of each mini-model found inside the book, but has very limited space and so is exceptionally disappointing compared to other manuals. Even Polybag manuals tend to show each step-by-step build better and more efficiently than these larger designs.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The set also includes two sticker sheets, one which is actually used and the other which is meant for additional play options.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set at this price range is sparsely populated with parts. You will find a lot of printed items, especially for the magical talking servants of the castle, but the bulk of the sets parts is made up of two large book sides and one book spine. There is also a printed Disney Princess element showing a nice silhouetted image of Belle&rsquo;s animation model. Overall not a very effective parts pack.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Micro-Dolls &amp; Friends</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Beast: Micro-Dolls have no ability to grip accessories and their hands are too small to attach studs to. Their hands can fit the hair accessories into them though so you can have them hold bows or butterflies or other things which slide into the small holes in the Mini-Dolls hair.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Beast includes two different hair elements, a mask for his beast form and a regular head of hair for his transformed state. His torso is printed with his suit jacket form the Ballroom scene.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Belle: Her Micro-Doll is printed with the dress from the ballroom scene, which is still quite majestic looking despite being on such a tiny frame. A Micro-Doll is roughly have the height of a Mini-Doll, so these would make excellent toddlers in the regular Mini-Doll line.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Cogsworth: A single printed 1x1 brick with a stud on top makes up Cogsworth in this set, a bit less impressive than previous versions, but effective enough I suppose.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Mrs. Potts &amp; Chip: The printed faces on the Teacup and Tea Pot accessories turn ordinary LEGO accessories into actual enchanted characters of the film quite effectively. Mrs. Potts was the original tea pot accessory after all which is why every single LEGO set using the accessory can&rsquo;t help appearing to be Mrs. Potts without a face. The set includes a spare Chip just in case you lose one.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Wardrobe: A single tall 1x2 brick with printed design and a pair of pearl gold elements on top create the illusion of Wardrobe, this character sadly isn&rsquo;t as grandiose as her actual on-screen counterpart and considering the scene they are emulating here I can&rsquo;t help feeling Lumiere should have been included as well to help add to the playability.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build &amp; The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This build is exceptionally mediocre. Simple enough to figure out, but not helped by the very limited use of the pamphlet style manual. Placing stickers on certain elements is simple enough, but it is strongly advised that you seek help if you should need it. Also, as there is no included official spot for the secondary sticker sheet, you can apply them wherever you&rsquo;d like, I personally chose not to, as I didn&rsquo;t see much of a point to it. They do add some extra details to the interior of the book, but overall are a tad haphazard looking when placed on the model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Speaking of which the finished product is an interesting model. Altogether you have a brilliantly clever looking book-shaped carry case to bring your other models along with and have endless fun anywhere you want. Everything fits inside fairly nicely to close it up and once open you can imagine tons of interesting scenes, recreate the famous ballroom scene, explore the west wing, venture outside and have some fun, it&rsquo;s all very nicely done. Overall the model is adequate for what the set is aiming for.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I purchased this set to see what it was like and I was mildly disappointed. While the overall set is quite good at capturing what it wants to capture, the execution and price range leaves me somewhat hesitant to recommend these sets. While they are fun, the build itself is really mediocre and not as enjoyable as I&rsquo;d hoped, the Micro-Dolls are very novel, but also rather limited in use next to other Mini-Doll sets. I honestly feel a bit cheated here, other sets included at least three or more Micro-Dolls compared to this one, and while this one also includes printed brick characters, I would have liked to have seen a Micro-Doll of Belle in her regular blue dress. The other sets feature multiple variations for Mulan and Ariel, so why not include both Belle&rsquo;s in this set? Before the big ballroom scene and after? I&rsquo;m also not liking the stickers idea for added detailing, it makes sense in regular sets to cut down on printed parts, but having stickers to decorate the inside of the storybook parts just seems really unimpressive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Overall if you&rsquo;re in that age range that enjoys this type of play style then this set is definitely for you. If you&rsquo;re an AFOL who adores cute things then this set is for you. If, like me, you&rsquo;re only interested in exploring novelty items once and then never again I&rsquo;d say skip it. Or get one of these on sale, because 25$ Canadian is insane for the amount of building in here. Aside from the large book pieces a lot of this building is Polybag level model design and decidedly not worth the asking price for all the new elements in these sets. Recommended to fans, everybody else can skip it.</p>
