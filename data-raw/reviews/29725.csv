<p>I could also confirm that the build experience is nice enough to make this a perfect mini gift for my nieces and nephews.</p>

<p>On the downside: Price is a bit high. SEK 129 could have been 109 considering short build, only one minidoll, and collectors will need to get multiple for the blind bag animals.</p>
