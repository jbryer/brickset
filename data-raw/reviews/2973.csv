I do not belief lego has ever made such a diverce instructions book.

"Neverroads","2010-08-21T05:58:43.063Z","A true classic","This is the only non-LEGO (afterall, it has no studs!) product I love as much as my most beloved childhood sets. My original book is ""played with"" to near death and only survives in the plastic cover it was put into when it fell apart to much. <br><br>I even gave this book a 5 brick rating on parts; it has some really useful stickers.<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"Skut","2007-10-02T07:59:15.547Z","Absolutely Awesome!","This book is the reason I became a townie.  Not only are there heaps of great ideas and instructions, the storyline featuring the famous Bill and Mary minifigs really brings the whole thing to life.  It's great for Classic Space and Castle ideas, but it's the Town stuff that really shines.  I am still using and updating ideas from this book on my current layout.  If you can get your hands on a copy (especially with stickers intact), grab it!  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"villicus","2008-06-26T11:37:05.937Z","So many good ideas","Read it and read it again, well, look at it would be the better word. Hundreds of good ideas are hidden in this book, and while you are getting the story of the pair shown there you will notice that lego is really endless playing. I recommend it strongly to add to anyones lego collection, this book is a true gem for everybody who loves the city theme. You see, all you need is some bulk brick to create all you want.
I can remember i loved it so hard when i was a child, all the things were fascinating and i rebuild nearly all of the models shown there. Lego at its best!

Such fond memories of continuing on the stories in my own lego town and I have to say that when I showed it to my 6 year old son his little eyes lit up and he proceeded to read and build in exactly the same way.

A lesson in imaginative play - Lego bosses take note!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-06-16T06:59:24.7Z","Minifigure Storytime","This is the 1980 building ideas book. These books were great for inspiration at the time and remain good for solid build reminders. They now also provide an insight in to the thoughts and ideas being thrown around at TLG. It would not be surprising if many ideas became refined and released as sets in following years.<div><br></div><div><b>Are You Sitting Comfortably? Then I'll Begin...</b></div><div>The book begins with a happy little story of a couple in their car, dreaming of their own house while driving through a magical Lego background landscape that features on just so many set boxes. Did I mention they are armed with a bunch of tools?</div><div><br></div><div>The story develops so they are merrily building their own house. Quite where all these spare bricks were supposed to come from was holy grail level information as my shops never stocked spare brick boxes. Perhaps some people got ordering information for loose and spare bricks but even then you have to be able to afford them.</div><div><br></div><div>Next up a random builder shows up and with his crew unload their flat pack office right next door off the back of their truck! We hope the couple are in agreement, no more peace and quiet. The stories are nice in that the photography allows a reader to see previous scenes evolving in the background at times and introduces new adventures.</div><div><br></div><div>There is a brief part where multiple and frustratingly unaffordable road plates are arranged in brilliant and varied layouts to give you ideas. The curves never had junction versions sadly but the possibilities are impressive.</div><div><br></div><div>Many builds feature along the way as the man and woman travel through town getting a job, a haircut and mingling. The builds include a crane, a mini supermarket you may want to expand in a different colour to red and some small town features. When the fire brigade rush out you can only guess that the builder neighbours caused it.</div><div><br></div><div>You can build emergency service buildings and vehicles here fitting in to the story of course. This linked in construction effort goes on with a circus, tv crew, windmill, ship harbour crane, boat, lorry, forklift, furniture, engineering depot, school, pick up truck, helicopter, aeroplane and the rest is about stickers.</div><div><br></div><div>Some of these builds give a couple of pictures to expose the basic idea where as other smaller more likely builds get detailed instructions. Unfortunately not so popular with all of us, the sticker book included here is actually really neat and they look great. However once you have used one, those bricks are either committed to the sticker for long term use or you will have to waste the sticker and clean up the bricks one day.</div><div><br></div><div>If you want to use them, a technique is to carefully make thin card or cloth backing for stickers with holes punched to clip between bricks. If this is too fiddly, just a tag of tape to hang a card backed sticker may be possible. A new buyer may want all the stickers intact for a complete book so do not feel you have to use them if they provide enough graphic design interest.</div><div><br></div><div><b>The End</b></div><div>A charming little story, basic builds from 1980 that stretch a limited brick inventory very nicely and well worth a trip back to early Town to regard what you may want to build now. Little kids will enjoy this as a picture book and collectors may prefer one from this series of books or need it if they are a completist. An insight in to the warm origins of the Town theme.</div>",TRUE,4,1,1,1,3

"TechnicNick","2011-06-03T08:38:18.687Z","Wonderful","This absolutely lovely book is presented as a pictorial history of it's two central characters (I had no idea they were called Bill and Mary until I read the review below), taking them through town, space and castle themes on a truly uplifting journey of discovery - both for them and the builders of the worlds they inhabit.<div><br></div><div>My own copy, owned since childhood, is well thumbed; the stickers have long gone but it's innocently optimistic message to generations of builders remains: Bill and Mary together can achieve anything.

"Count_Tofu","2016-02-23T19:36:18.18Z","A source of ideas before the age of internet","<p>Besides Lego catalogs, this was about the only way to get new ideas and be inspired back then. Of course we used our imagination, but it was fed by idea books like this.</p>

<p>The Lego idea books filled you with wonder and new inspiration, on the other hand it also made you painfully aware of how many&nbsp;possibilities you did NOT have for lack of bricks.</p>

<p>In the middle you would find a pretty large set of stickers to make all kind of things. I remember creating schooltables using rooftiles, a school black board&nbsp;and a piano with the stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have good memories&nbsp;gazing in this book over and over again.</p>

"Niki124","2023-02-19T17:51:29.877Z","The bible of Lego building","<p>Even when we finally got hold of a copy of this book, I could hardly believe we actually owned it. I can still recall reading it for the first time - page after page of things to build, and lots that we could start building straight away. I lost count of the number of times we built the flatbed furniture truck over the years, and we had a couple of builds of the houses too, the second time adding in our own moderations.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The variety of things to build varies widely, and covers the then-three minifigure worlds of the town, the castle, and space. From the simple furniture made from a few bricks and a sticker, to the large space vehicles and cargo boat requiring several specialist pieces, there&#39;s always a challenge. But it&#39;s the story of the couple through the book I remember best, the building of their home, their explorations of the town, and when their house is damaged in a fire they spend time during the rebuilding on a trip to space (as we all thought we&#39;d be doing in the 21st century back then) and go back in time to the mediaeval castle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It&#39;s this aspect that comes across best - it is, after all, an Ideas Book, not an Instruction Book. It&#39;s designed to inspire Lego builders, and to help them gain confidence in building simply so that they feel able to tackle the more complex builds once they get their hands on the required specialist pieces. All in all, it&#39;s a great demonstration that the worlds of Lego Minifigures had come of age and that there&#39;s something to be built by anyone, regardless of skill level.&nbsp;</p>
