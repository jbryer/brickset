However, unlike some of the other sets of this type, I think that Cole&#39;s speeder car is worth buying even&nbsp;for older fans and is a very underrated set. In this review, I will tell you why.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>The box for this set is a normal $10&nbsp;set box size. On the front you can see a big 4+ symbol in the corner, which is common with Juniors sets nowadays. Besides that, there&#39;s nothing interesting about the packaging.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions and building experience&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This set is obviously made for very young kids in mind, so the building process was VERY simple and straightforward. It took me about 5 minutes to build the model. The instructions were simple and easy to follow. On the back there is a poster for Prime Empire, which the set is based on, and an advertisement for the rest of the early 2020 sets.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>For people like me, this set&#39;s parts are the main reason to buy this set. Let&#39;s start with recolours. We have two classic ninja katanas in orange, four wheel rims in orange,&nbsp;the 16M chain piece in transparent fluorescent green, and piece&nbsp;50373&nbsp;new in white. We also get a lot of new pieces. We have the Prime Empire Ninja hood dual-moulded in black and white with Cole&#39;s symbol on the top, the rat headpiece, this time in sand green, the Keytana in&nbsp;transparent fluorescent green, which is great to get a collectable piece in such a small set. There is also the new controller piece in black used for Hausner&#39;s weapon. While all of these new pieces are new for 2020, they all appear in other sets. The only piece exclusive to this set (aside from the recolours) is the slope piece in black with Cole&#39;s logo printed on top, which is fantastic to get if you are a fan of Cole, or if you want to make a Cole-themed vehicle.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>In this set we get two minifigures: Hausner and Digi Cole.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s start with arguably the more interesting minifigure of the two: Digi Cole. Digi Cole comes with the new mask piece, which I mentioned in the parts section. Under the mask, Cole has two different faces, one with his VR headset on and the other face has a very happy/confident expression for Cole, which we rarely get for him. He has a lot of very nice printing on his torso and legs, however, some people may not like the orange belt, as there is no other orange on Cole. Personally, I am fine with the orange belt, since if Cole didn&#39;t have it, he would be just black and white, which would be kinda boring. I wish that he would&#39;ve come with his armour, but then he wouldn&#39;t be able to fit in the speeder car. Overall, I think that Digi Cole is a very good minifigure, especially if you aren&#39;t getting the Empire Temple of Madness, which is the only other set with Digi Cole.</p>

<p>The second minifigure is Hausner. He has a lot of printing on his torso and legs, which may be a bit too messy for some people. Hausner has no printing on his head, which is understandable, as all the details on it are done with dual-moulding. Most of Hausner is sand green except for the Flame Yellowish Orange (or as I like to call it, Keetongu-orange) legs. I think that he would have looked a lot better, if his legs were medium azur, to match his surf board. Overall, he is a nice minifigure, but to me, Cole is a bit more desirable, as Hausner also comes in a&nbsp;$30 set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In terms of accessories, Digi Cole comes with a Keytana and two orange swords, which can be stored on his speeder car. Hausner comes with a sword which looks very similar to Kopaka&#39;s original sword from Bionicle G1.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>For the builds included we have Hausner&#39;s surf board and obviously, Cole&#39;s Speeder Car itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hausner&#39;s surfboard is just your regular surfboard piece with two&nbsp;transparent fluorescent green 1X2 plates attached to the bottom to make Hausner fly. Other than that, there is really not much to talk about.</p>

<p>The main build is Cole&#39;s Speeder Car. On the front we have a printed slope with Cole&#39;s symbol, a console in grey for Cole to pilot the car, and&nbsp;two small cones placed on the very front of the vehicle, which unfortunately fall off extremely easily. On the back there are two clips in which you can store Cole&#39;s orange katanas for storage or design, and there are also two round bricks in&nbsp;transparent fluorescent green which much like the cones at the front, fall off with little use. Obviously, you can fit Cole in the middle of the Speeder Car and when he is in it, it looks surprisingly good.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Because this set is made specifically for kids, it is important that it has a lot of playability, and I think that it definitely delivers in that aspect. While Cole&#39;s Speeder Car doesn&#39;t have any stud shooter or any other play features, I think that any kid can have lots of fun with just driving the car around the room and making Cole fight with Hausner. I also think that the conflict in a box is well executed here, since both sides have something to fight with. However, maybe it would be better if Hausner had a stud shooter or something like that to make it a bit more of an even battle.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Even though this is a Juniors/4+ set, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes Ninjago. While yes, the building experience is really simple, the pieces and minifigures included are fantastic and definitely worth the&nbsp;$9.99 price. And because this set is made for children, I think that they will appreciate it even more.&nbsp;</p>
