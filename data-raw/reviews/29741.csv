<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>Model itself looks good. From the first glance it looks accurate, even though the body part is for me too thick. It mostly because of part usage: It uses bricks with cross (technic) hole to attach wings. Back engine section is too small, and front canopy is too extended. Round plate at the top is nice. Wings are not bad, but the gap in the attaching spot looks poor. It is not so hart to fix, you can use thin technic beam 2l, which would fill the gap. Unfortunately&nbsp;technic elements that keeps wings together are not available in black and looks very bad here in LBG. Also wings are bit too short. The walkie-talkie&nbsp;used as a cannons is a great thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Model is fairly sturdy and easy to fly around and play with it.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Parts are fairly useful. There are two pairs of short (2x2) and long (4x2) wing parts, some trans red bricks, which are always fine and has wide range of usage in MOCs, Four walkie-talkie, which I don&#39;t think I have ever thought about as a detailing part before. Some technic part addition is good, and great thing, they&#39;ve got us four 1x5 plate, which is awsome. So parts make a game in this set.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Very small set, that looks nice, but if you are diehard SW fan then you&#39;ll spot many flaws. Bricks are clearly the best part of the set. I think it was worth its price (~$4).</p>
