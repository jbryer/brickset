Its box is very special and it has a card&nbsp;inside the box because the idea is that you give it to someone as a gift. It is an interesting build, and most of the rat&#39;s limbs are on ball joints, which makes it very poseable. The coolest piece used was the elephant tusk piece as the rat&#39;s tail. The rat&nbsp;is cuter in real life than in pictures and is a good display piece. However, it has no features, it is only for putting on a shelf. Overall, a good promo worth the eighty dollars spent to get it.&nbsp;</p>

This is my first time with one of these Chinese Zodiac based sets and I must admit I was quite impressed with it. And I will attempt to articulate why with this review.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A very impressive package design, a small square pop-open type reminiscent of LEGO Sets bygone past, you can pop the flap open to find a small tray to store the parts and manual when finished with the built model. The front has a To/From sticker design printed on, this name tag element is meant to hold names when given as a gift.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The image on the front shows the set, includes the name across it and a large NEW above it. The back shows off certain features and a pile of parts involved in the build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is a nice thick looking rectangular design with very well put together pages allowing for easy to follow build steps. A parts list on the back and that&rsquo;s about it. There is also a special envelope inside of a nice thick card stock with a very impressive looking gold embossed representation on the back of this envelope. Noting is inside of it, I believe this is meant to hold a small card when giving this set as a gift.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A fairly standard selection of bricks and plates and other unique elements make up the bulk of the pieces in this set. A few printed eye tiles are included, nothing very special, but I&rsquo;m certain many will enjoy finding uses for these parts if they have more than one Year of the Rat in their collection.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Somewhat similar to a BrickHeadz this build creates a model rat using LEGO bricks, including a lot of bricks with side studs during the process will see some similarities, but overall this build is a bit more involved and impressive for the finished product looks nothing like a BrickHead while using a few similar techniques to it. Really impressed with this build, found it thoroughly engaging.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">With ball jointed ears and paws and a tail that can swivel around thanks to the Technic Pin connection, this Rat model is highly impressive. He can spin his head too. As a unique set it&rsquo;s highly collectible too, but honestly I am just all around impressed with how they designed and pulled off making a cute almost cartoon inspired rat model.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I can be far too positive at times. But that&rsquo;s because I just love LEGO so much, it&rsquo;s inventive, clever, creative and fun to collect and build. It&rsquo;s also great fun to discuss and point out aspects of a set I find enjoyable. This set represents the Chinese Zodiac and is a very impressive design. It also uses SNOT design very effectively to limit the number of visible studs. I enjoyed this set and would recommend it if you also enjoy sets of this style and function. If you prefer to collect the latest Ninjago or Star Wars set it&rsquo;s definitely safe to skip this. This is more designed to be a display piece rather than something to build and play with. It compliments past Chinese Zodiac sets quite well too, so if you managed to get them there&rsquo;s no reason not to get this one.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Recommended for fans.</p>
