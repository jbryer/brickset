<p>First, I love this set. As for one of old Japanese LEGO fans, it&#39;s really welcoming and attractive set from skyline series. It is what Tokyo is itself now. There are plenty of characteristic monuments or places packed in a small plate, which actually makes me feel marvellous&nbsp;!&nbsp;LEGO company made a great job for designing miniatured Tokyo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But there are some tiny Tsukkomi (some kind of complaints)&nbsp;left.</p>

<p>1. The Cocoon tower in the middle is very famous and outstanding at Shinjuku&nbsp;town but no LEGO fans would have expected that it is included as a part of TOKYO skyline. It&#39;s never the symbol of this big metropolis.</p>

<p>2. Mt. Fuji on background must be needed to show JAPAN. But it&#39;s more than&nbsp;100km far from Tokyo. So many people living in Tokyo always visit Fuji-san for short journey of fan every year to forget buzz of Tokyo...! That&#39;s why Mt. Fuji is not of Tokyo.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;ve started to become a fan of the Architecture sets, and this is no exception.</p>

<p>One of the draws for this model was as a display piece, being one of the places I&#39;ve visited from the Architecture series.</p>

<p>The build progresses nicely, starting from a series of plates for the base, with some interesting gaps that get used later. There is a good range of building techniques on display for such a small set: sideways, upside-down, back-to-back. This makes the overall experience more enjoyable, even though it doesn&#39;t take too long to build (about 1.5h at a leisurely pace for me). The choice of locations is nice, representing some of the best of Tokyo&#39;s recognisable, and well-visited, attractions in an instantly recognisable manner. In fact, I regard it as a perfect build for the subject - it&#39;s the first set I haven&#39;t made any improvements on.</p>

<p>There is also a nice selection of parts used to represent the various parts, and very nicely done at micro scale. Some parts are so nice, I ordered some more through Bricks &#39;n&#39; Pieces as they&#39;ll be useful for other models.</p>

<p>Can&#39;t really give this one a playability score, as it&#39;s not really a play set - definitely designed as a display piece. In that regard, it works well, especially viewed at a slight distance.</p>

"aarekk","2021-03-30T14:43:21.137Z"," Tokyo reminiscences","<p>I&#39;ve been in Tokyo 3 times, travelling from Poland and from this perspective&nbsp;(not living in the&nbsp;city but visiting it every few&nbsp;years)&nbsp;everything is on its right place here. Tokyo Tower with its obvious resemblance to Parisian Eiffel, Mt Fuji as I remember seen from the top of&nbsp;Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building, distant but present in the landscape. Cocoon Tower beautifully built in micro scale was always my favourite skyscraper in the city. Really gorgeous. Hanami, neon lights, An accent from the Imperial Palace, Tradition and modernity. I have also been to Paris, London, Venice or Berlin, but I don&#39;t like these sets like this one, and I would not put any other of them in my room as a stand. I would buy Frisco, but I haven&#39;t been there yet...<br />
<br />
I am thinking on buying second box. One is already on my souvenir shelf, the second one is necessary because the selection of bricks is very handy.&nbsp;</p>
