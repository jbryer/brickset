They&#39;ve released two separate models of Burj Khalifa, with the second iteration being re-released, so it makes sense they decided to capture more of the one the most unique cities in the world.</p>

<p>This set features four main buildings:</p>

<p>-Burj Al&nbsp;Arab Jumeirah Hotel: the rightmost building that looks like a giant sale. The detail captured here in incredible, but from some angles this building can look a bit odd.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-The Jumeirah Emirates Towers Hotel: the leftmost building. These are designed interestingly as well, although they do wobble in place a bit. I figured later in the instructions, there would be a step that shows how to anchor them down a bit more, but if it&#39;s only on display it&#39;s not a huge deal.</p>

<p>-The Dubai Frame: Just a large gold-coloured door frame. Captures the real landmark nicely.</p>

<p>-Burj Khalifa: Of course you can&#39;t forget the tallest building in the world, which dominates the skyline of this set just as it does its real life counterpart. The actual building of the Burj Khalifa in this set was a bit awkward since most steps are very repetitive. I found myself having to look back a few steps to make sure everything was placed correctly.</p>

<p>-The set also include the Dubai Fountain at the base of Burj Khalifa, as well as little palm trees, which make the atmosphere a lot more intrinsic of Dubai.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a very unique skyline and a very unique model. I would definitely say Architecture collectors and enthusiasts should budget for this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My only concerns were how wobbly and fragile it feels. I have the San Francisco skyline set which is a lot more sturdy in comparison. There&#39;s hardly an baseplate constructed here. The Emirates Hotel is wobbly, the Burj Al Arab is a bit fragile, and Burj Khalifa teeters a lot when moving the set around. Definitely be careful with how you handle it and keep it in a secure place.</p>

<p>Overall, a great display, impressive design, and a more-challenging-than-usual building experience.</p>
