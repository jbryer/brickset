"Novelty","2007-05-29T10:58:21.15Z","Crosseyed","This is a nice little wagon and with two shields mounted on the side and two crossbows in front, it's a great supply for the said shields and crossbows.  However, it has to be wondered how the crossbows is supposed to work!.  The handle seems weird and could probably be improved with a better colour choice, but nevertheless, it still trumps all the hand-pushed carts without handles.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-20T18:41:11.217Z","Excelent for any army...","This is a little set from the classic fright knights, have useful things to build an army of minifigures. Some weapons, like the three crossbows, and the spear, or two shields are excelent for it. The minifigure wears a old helmet, of classic and old castle series. The cart is an addition for armies, have two castle classic wheels, useful in castle themes, not for anothers like city. But, this set still great, shooting anything, or nothing, it can be used in creations very easy to shot anything, but this is a small set and can't shot nothing. If you are searching for a small classic castle of lego, this is an option.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"tye","2019-08-25T16:27:23.467Z","Great for siege warfare","<p>This is a small crossbow cart. If you have several of these is great to lay siege against an enemy castle. Really wish Lego would sell more smaller based sets like this. They practically sell like hotcakes! Strangely I believe this set was never released in the US. Couldn&#39;t find it on Amazon, had to order from ebay.</p>

<p>Comes with a single Fright Knight foot soldier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build isn&#39;t complicated. Real simple and easy.</p>

<p>I miss this style helmet and has been pretty much replaced by the Noseguard Helmet. The only thing with this older style of helmet is that they had to print the face a little lower so the character&#39;s face could be seen through the helmet. I see why they discontinued this helmet but maybe someday Lego will update it.</p>

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-08T09:22:39.473Z","LEGO Castle (Fright Knights) - Crossbow Cart Review","This set is a really neat army builder. It has a knight minifig who has a black helmet and a brown spear. The wagon is really neat as well. It's a simple wagon with a shield on each side, three crossbows (one on each side and one on the top) and a wheel on each side. On the back we also get a handle. This set can be maneuvered very easy. It's a good impulse set but I would recommend you to buy the bigger models first before you get this one.<br><br>All
in all this set is a good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
