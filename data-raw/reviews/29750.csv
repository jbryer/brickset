<p>&nbsp;I got this really cheap, but that doesn&#39;t excuse it for the price being at $30. $5 or $10 off would&#39;ve been better. The parts are mediocre for a Duplo build that is supposed to be a &quot;Lab.&quot; The building experience did not exist due to building random things and calling it a &quot;Lab.&quot; Even for the Duplo age range, the playability basically comes from the motorcycle and the characters.</p>
