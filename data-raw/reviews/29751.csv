I had hoped to review 10270 but upon finding that this august assemblage has already been reviewed several times, I turn to its two-dimensional but no less fecund kissing cousin for the following appreciation.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Initial impressions.</b> 11010, a baseplate of especial utility for devotees of empty spaces, presents itself inside a stiff sleeve of polypropylene, itself useful for filling up the world&rsquo;s empty spaces with plastic. The front bears a photograph of bricks placed on top of the enclosed baseplate, immediately asserting two motifs: self-referentiality and unrealized potentiality. An age range printed on the sleeve cautions against giving 11010 to children under four, prompting one to wonder under what conditions a plastic plate of ten and one-eighth inches square could pose a choking hazard.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Symphony for the senses.</b> For the eyes, 11010 offers a variety of optical illusions but steadfastly declines to reciprocate one&rsquo;s gaze. The plate draws on a distinguished lineage of abstract expressionism and minimalism but never achieves comparable intensity. It excels in its study of tactile contrasts, however: on one side, a regularly variegated matrix of protruding cylinders; on the other, its smoother inverse.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Of negligible and nonstandard thickness, the plate is relatively supple and produces distinctive sounds when flexed. The plate&rsquo;s sonic qualities are most readily appreciated when loosely grasped from two diagonally opposite corners and shaken vigorously toward and away from one&rsquo;s head. As expected, 11010 produces smooth ululations but its tonal palate remains limited.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The plate initially possessed a pungent nose of processed petroleum. This olfactory dimension quickly faded, but not before evoking childhood memories of digging through boxes of bricks while one&#39;s parents tried to watch television. Its gustatory attributes are understated, with a slight chemical quality at the forefront masking fainter notes of acidity. The mouthfeel is not unpleasant but quickly becomes monotonous.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Conceptual challenges. </b>11010 revels, as its number suggests, in binaries: convexity on one face balances concavity on the other, paradoxically evoking presence through absence. The photograph on the front alludes to this dramatic tension, depicting &ldquo;models not included.&rdquo; Its relentless self-referentiality disclaims any pretense of meaning, but despite its 1,024 molded self-proclamations that it constitutes &ldquo;LEGO,&rdquo; nagging doubts persist: Is anything only ever what it appears?</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The precise status of 11010 remains unexpectedly challenging, a characteristic common to many Basic offerings but brought into particularly sharp focus by 11010&rsquo;s relentless planar whiteness. It defies received ontologies: What is a brick, precisely? Can one piece be described as a set? The plate poses questions but declines to adjudicate them.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">11010 remains phenomenally limited but not unappealing. Three stars (and apologies to the late Russell Baker).</span></span></span></p>
