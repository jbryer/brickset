She was impressed at first by the colors of the bricks and the quick build. She zoomed the truck around a few times and then forgot about it. I guess, it served its purpose to make her day happy.</p>

<p>The packaging is eye catching with a transparent box showcasing the parts and the build schematic clearly printed on the back. The model&#39;s colors are attractive with the car chassis and the ladder bricks cast in a color combination unique to this set. The super simple quick build makes for a good insta-play gift for a toddler. A folded print sheet, included with the set, provides a street scenery for the truck to roll over. This just about sums up all the strengths of the set.</p>

<p>In terms of functionality, there are basically two functions to the truck: it rolls and the ladder can be raised from flat horizontal to 45 degree incline angle. Granted, this is a simple model by design and the colors are pleasant. Yet, the shape of the truck leaves a lot to be desired. It is too blocky compared to pretty much any other Duplo vehicle out there. In fact, from the front, it does not resemble a truck at all.</p>

<p>The 10917 Fire Truck would make a nice on-the-go gift for a child or a complement to other Duplo sets. On its own, it just does not have much to offer beyond the attractive package. When it comes to Duplo vehicles, for just a little bit more money <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10886-1/My-First-Car-Creations"" target=""_blank"">10886 My First Car Creations</a> delivers a while lot more playability and better looking vehicles. The 10917 Fire Truck is not at all in that league even though it costs almost half as much.</p>
