"deluckybrick","2007-07-23T17:29:18.91Z","I don't see what everyone's whining about...","This set was probably the fifth Lego set that I ever got, and it still is one of my favorites.

Pros:
-Knight is very good looking
-Shiny sword (who cares if its not rare)
-Cool looking dragon

Cons:
-Dragon could use more mobility
-My knight dosent fit on the dragon's back when he's holding his stuff.

Come on, guys, this is a classic arrangement, a rider and steed!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-02-08T03:02:44.2Z","Dragon Rider","Found this set in the box today and thought I should review it as it was my first set in the Fright Nights series. It is the typical small set of the series containing the leader and an animal. What makes this set different to the usual soldier and horse is the horse is one solid piece and isn't an enemy. With this series the dragon is a few pieces and can double as friend or foe.

The mini-fig is Bat Lord. He is in his usual dress of grey pants, black belt, red top with black sleeves and a pattern on it. He also has the black bat shaped helmet and a grey cape bearing the bat logo. His face is a frown with a fringe, eyebrows and moustache. In this set he also come with the silver sword which was a mint piece when I was a kid. Also he has the &quot;Magical Bat Staff&quot; which basically consists of a See-through red pole with a bat on the top. Very basic kind of lame but an awesome accessory because it was different.

The dragon is the same as all dragons, consisting of 8 pieces and has neon orange wings and flame. He is all black with moving jaw, arms and tail.

I know the single mini-fig, usually the leader, mounted on an animal has been the typical small set throughout the years but for people who don't get much LEGO or have much money this is a great set. Yes for us privileged people it might not seem that cool but still a good one to get on a day out.

Overall this set has good aesthetics and has more playability than most models of the same size and type. Again its not a necessity to own but a good cheap way to get Bat Lord, a dragon and the accessories. I feel this model can pull a 5/10 or average as it dose look very good and can be combined with any castle set and you will have allot of fun. I would recommend this to anyone who wants dragons and is looking for a cheap way to get Bat Lord.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-20T14:43:57.437Z","A classic dragon rider set","This set have a dragon, and it's master, another fright knight. The fright knight have a cover and a staff with a bat on the top, too the large silver sword. The helmet too, is a symbol of these cool knights, like the red parts on body. One part of the staff can be used too in the lego star wars lightsabers' base, and is very useful. The dragon is black, and have orange and red parts, cool colors for a berserker dragon. This isn't very playable like the new, is more coolest than the silly of castle, but no than the great ones of the vikings. I rate this complete and classic set of a dragon and it's master 5/5.

"MEGADETH","2008-03-13T04:19:23.78Z","Great small set!","Its a great small set for those who dont really like the larger set of this horror castle theme but want to collect some of the important figures. the black dragon and basil are worth for your collection.
The Basil figure come up with the silver sword and his bat mace, also the good thing is that it include also his wing coat unlike the small royal king set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-08T09:17:25.847Z","LEGO Castle (Fright Knights) - Bat Lord Review","I don't think there's much to say about it. It's a good impulse set. We get a dragon which comes with a translucent orange fins on each side which are movable and we get a mouth wich can be opened as well. This set also comes with a movable tail. The minifigure is very cool. I really like the black helmet with the fins on each side. The cape has a bat on the back and on the red torso has some nice markings as well. This knight also has a sword&nbsp; and a translucent red staff with a bat on the top. This impulse set is a great army builder but I would recommend you to buy the bigger sets first.<br><br>All

"AETerry","2010-12-02T20:01:49.68Z","Bat Lord Review","Personally I always thought of this set as Dragon Lord due to the big black dragon in it.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>No matter, I picked this set up with a host of other Fright Knight sets at the time as LEGO was clearly introducing and going fullbore with a fantasy theme with Castle.<br/>&nbsp;<br/>As a small set, this is great, as the main reasons for it are the Black Dragon and possiblly the minifigure with it. For those on a budget, the pricing of this set under $5 back in it's time, made it easy and cheap to get. And I was feeling a couldn't get enough dragons!<br/>&nbsp;<br/>There's not much of a build, this is closer to being a minifigure pack witih it being the Fright Knight and a big dragon. <br/>&nbsp;<br/>If I was to do this differently, I'd have bought at least two, not one...

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T14:20:39.903Z","Lord of the Bats!","<p>Set #6007 Bat Lord: I bought this set back during my teen years (has it been that long?) and it was fairly cheap back in the day. I'm not sure how much increase in value it's had by now, but I don't collect Lego for value. I collect it because it excites my imagination even now that I'm just shy of thirty. (Boy am I dating myself.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set has nothing in it as far as construction goes - basically you're just putting together the Mini-Figure and then snapping a few wings on a dragon, but you don't buy this set for the build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bat Lord comes with three things that I immediately gravitated towards, first it has the black dragon a rare find indeed, second it comes with a ruby staff topped by a black bat and third it includes a chromed silver large sword. (The cape is a plus as well.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have loved this set since buying it and can't recommend it enough - the Bat Lord's face print is a somber looking serious expression, the ruby staff (Just a transparent red flag pole, but still cool.) and the large silver chromed sword make for excellent accessories. The fact that he probably uses the staff to control the black dragon with the flaming red wings to do his evil bidding is also a cool thing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Really I could go on and on, but I think I've said all that's needed. A fun little set that was a bargain price back in the late nineties and an excellent addition to any Castle collections/displays - and if you have other Fright Night themed sets you can loan this Bat Lord a large shield from one of his soldiers so he can truly look menacing while riding his black dragon into battle.</p>",TRUE,5,3,1,5,4
"TheLEGOshogun","2012-05-25T12:49:03.583Z","Cool but not cheap.","<p>I got this set quite a while ago and I was quite impressed. The dragon could of used more work and the price per peice is a massive rip of. It's a decent army builder and the bat lord is an epic minifigure.

I would highly reccomend it.</p><p><strong>Pros -</strong></p><p>Nice minifig.</p><p>Army builder.</p><p>Amazing cape.</p><p><strong>Cons -</strong></p><p>Dragon could be better.</p><p>Expensive much :L</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for reading ;3</p><p>&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,4,5,1,3,1
