"sct","2020-10-24T12:18:09.697Z","One of three best duplo sets available","<p>I&#39;d say there are always three best duplo sets: a figures/animal set, currently it&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10805-1/Around-the-World"">Around the World - 10805</a>, train set (trains are cool - period), either&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10874-1/Steam-Train"">Steam Train - 10874</a> or&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10875-1/Cargo-Train"">Cargo Train - 10875</a>, and there&#39;s the set with the most and best building bricks. And 10929 Modular Playhouse is currently that set.</p>

<p><strong>5 large plates and more</strong></p>

<p>This set has 5 large duplo 6x12 plates, 3 <em>white</em> and 2 <em>brick yellow</em>. From my experience these are the main construction blocks for all duplo buildings and I have always had too few, as there arent that many sets that have them, and even if they do, it&#39;s just 1 or 2. There&#39;s lots of doors, windows, furniture which are very useful when kids build their own, smaller buildings.</p>

<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p>This set can be built in three ways, all of them are in the book with the set. It&#39;s a rather complex duplo set, my 2.5yo couldn&#39;t build it alone, but with my help he did have fun building it. It&#39;s duplo, there&#39;s virtually no complexity in it for an AFOL, so I really can&#39;t say much more.</p>

<p><strong>A starter set</strong></p>

<p>This would be a great starter set for KFOLs. It has 5 figures, some &quot;equipment&quot; (guitar, toilet, bed - see <a href=""https://brickset.com/inventories/10929-1"">the inventory</a> for details). One can play family with this set, build various buildings or combine both. Overall there&#39;s a good balance of construction bricks and play-bricks.</p>

<p>For us, the house was dismantled after a day and became a skyscraper, then a large hotel, then there were multiple stations at a train track, there was much more in the meantime, and now I have some shops set up by my kids. We have some more bricks from various sets, but the beforementioned large plates were a great and very needed addition to our collection. I&#39;m considering buing a second set just for the blocks.</p>

If an adult figure is sitting down, you can balance the guitar so it looks like they are playing. The baby fits on the rocking horse, which rocks.&nbsp; My favourite part is the family.&nbsp; The parents look super cool and my daughter thinks the baby is cute.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is also great when combined with the&nbsp;white castle set in the Duplo Frozen line that has a ton of white pieces and some cool blue ice pieces.&nbsp; Additionally or alternatively the Chinese New Year/Preschool set has a ton of white, red and brown pieces.&nbsp; Either or both of these sets with the Modular House give many possibilities for making your own constructions while being able to keep some colour theme to the build.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
