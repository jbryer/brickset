<p>The price is average for a Classic set. The playability is mediocre due to these just being locations. The parts are also very mediocre. The building experience was mediocre due to the locations being very blocky sometimes.</p>

<p>The pieces come in lots of shapes and colours that match very well with other classic sets (even old ones) if you happen to have some.</p>

<p>The manual ideas for me were very inspirational, showing me novel ways of assembling pieces to form a beautiful result, some that I never had thought about.</p>
