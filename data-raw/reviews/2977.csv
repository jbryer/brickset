"Novelty","2007-05-07T11:52:24.593Z","King and Thieves","The King was the centrepiece of the Royal Knights and a small set to highlight him as a starting set for those who can't afford the bigger sets might have been a good idea.  However, kings are usually rather unique and there aren't that many around at any time so nobody would want to create an army of them.  This set would have been better if it had a knight's helmet of some sort in addition to the crown.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-06T22:19:23.42Z","This set isn't complete","Ok, I understand why the king should be the smallest set, but did they really have to leave it as simple as a figure on a horse?  At least give him the fancy cape or a white plume!  A weapons rack or throne or anything else would make this much more reasonable.  Either that or they should have released a mounted Royal Knight instead so an army of them can be built up easily, like the Black Knight.  If you don't own this little set, it will probably go unnoticed if you have the King's Carriage or Royal Knights Castle instead; and the kings in those have a cape/plume! ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-10-25T10:57:10.217Z","Not really worth buying","You get a king on a horse. He has neither a cape nor a feather on his helmet/crown. So it's really not a very special set. The only cool thing is the long sword. But when you clip it to the saddle, the sword must always point upwards. It cannot point downwards. It's too long. By the way, you get two dark gray lances. One is extra. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2008-02-07T05:06:24.81Z","The King and His Horse","Didn't even have to build this one I pulled it out of the box complete, which isn't hard to do due to the size of the model.

The model is what it comes across as, The Royal King and his horse from the Castle series. The horse is white with a red saddle and a blue flag mounted on a grey pole. 

The king is wearing a white and red shirt that is spilt up into quarters with the lion symbol in the middle. He is also wearing blue pants and a golden crown. He is armed with a large shield, bearing the lions head symbol on it and a large silver sword. The crown and the sword were absolutely mint pieces when I was a kid and I have to say this was the easiest cheapest way to get them. 

I know the single mini-fig, usually the leader, mounted on an animal has been the typical small set throughout the years but for people who don't get much LEGO or have much money this is a great set. Yes for us privileged people it might not seem that cool but still a good one to get on a day out.

The biggest let down for me and flaw in this model is the saddle. You can't clip the sword on the saddle hanging down, as it is about 5mm too long and makes the horse fall over. You can clip it on facing up but it looks dumb and is dangerous for a King.

Overall without being used in play with other models this one really is for display purposes and due to that I have to rate this one a 4/10 or Below Average. It has the aesthetics and kept many children happy over the years but looking back it is a bit of a let down. Not a necessity to have but still a good cheepie. Also good for anyone who needs another horse or a king with shiny bits.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-17T15:47:53.09Z","This set is complete, but is small...","This is another small set from the royal knights subtheme, have the itens to a king and his horse. This set like the &quot;Samurai Swordsman&quot; from the ninja subtheme, and deserves be reviewed in comparision with small sets like this. The horse don`t have armors, but don`t needs due to the color be great to one, if with armors, the color isn`t showed. Another great thing on this small set is the king and his itens, like the shield, the crown and the sword. This sword is rare to now, but is one of the greater swords in the lego sets. The crown don`t have much differences, was reused very times to the minifigures of kings. The horse have also a piece that can carries weapons or shields, is where the spear of joust is putted. The colors and the design of the king are greater than the colors of the new king of the new castle. It was a cheap option to have a king minifigure, but many don`t knows about that now and rate the set low. For a small set in comparision with others like the &quot;Samurai Swordsman&quot;, this deserves a 5/5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Dentarthurdent","2009-03-17T03:48:31.45Z","The Pampered Monarch","Now let me make my intentions clear straight away. I have owned this set for over a decade and am proud to say that I have registered countless playtime hours with the thing. When I saw this set rating of 2.8 I was appalled. What had this set done to deserve such menial treatment? Without being too rude I can state that the other reviewers have failed to view this set relative to its price - but that's not to say this is a bad set in any single way. Thus, I write this review in an effort to improve its rating and because I am tired and need some time off right now - this seems a more than useful way of spending it.

As little as it is, there are a number of notable merits to this set. The obvious ones are, of course, the Gold Helmet and the Silver Sword. The shield is more than adequate, while the saddle, flagpole, flag and white horse are welcome additions. 

So what's all the complaining about? More than likely it is your ignorance that is to blame if you do not enjoy this set! Unless you have no imagination at all and cannot think of a suitable context within which this rich monarch can reign supreme, this is a set well deserving of a perfect 5. Go the Royal Knights!

It is always important to remember that no set can be rated based on universal practices or measured - every set must be viewed relatively, taking into account a wide range of factors depending on the circumstances of the set. As such, this set, being released in 1995, including both gold and silver components and offering such a rich experience of playtime and adventure deserves, truly and surely, 5/5.

"Bside","2010-02-02T21:18:22.357Z","It is the king after all.","I actually didn't know I have this set until recently when i dug it out from my spare parts. Well, at least I didn't remember I bought it. I thought it is part of another set or something.

So, a King on a horse with a shield and a sword. I guess it is complete on its own. What else you expect a king to have? money?

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T14:29:31.22Z","The King Rides into Battle","<p>Set #6008 Royal King: Basically a cheap alternative to having a king without buying one of the more expensive sets. I loved that fact alone if nothing else. He was cheap back in the day, it's ove ten years since I bought him at retail and he is definitely starting to show his age.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chromed silver sword has lost some of its luster and the white horse is a bit faded. The Royal King can lead his soldiers against the forces of the Fright Knights or evil Wizard Majisto on his white steed. If you're looking to add a king to your collection and you can't afford the more expensive castles or other large scale sets with a king, then I recommend trying to find this set. Otherwise it's not really a must own unless of course you're a LEGO Castle Completist.</p>",TRUE,3,3,1,4,3
"LEGOSLUG","2011-10-28T23:41:36.533Z","Ride into Battle to fight: nobody!","<p>Here's my review of the set 6008, Royal King.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>The Minifigure:</h4><p>*&nbsp;A Royal King. His head has a red moustache and beard, his torso has red knight printing, and he has blue legs. The minifigure comes with a shield and a lance. A pretty rare figure actually, and a hallmark to the set.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>The Build:</h4><p>It takes 2 mins. The build has no experiance whatsoever, but for what it is you get a pretty good deal. In the actual build, there is a horse, and its saddle. That is all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Conclusion:</h4><p>My conclusion: Get it if you can, because it's pretty hard to come by now. Great to get a king for your army, add it to your collection. 4/5.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LEGOSLUG</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>P.S. Please see my other reviews and bricklists.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,3,5
"Lego_Photos_X","2022-09-17T18:03:43.403Z","Nice little Classic Castle Set","<p>Yes... Finally, I can review more classic castle. This is from the&nbsp;<em>&quot;Royal Knights&quot;&nbsp;</em>subtheme from 90&#39;s, and it is kinda what it looks like from the box/manual art. <em>What you get?</em> - Well... first of all you have this classic styled white horse with red saddle. The saddle has two clips in it (like they normally do) and one of them&nbsp;has a dark gray &quot;flagpole&quot; in it. You can&#39;t see the actual blue flag in the box&nbsp;<em>(or manual)</em>&nbsp;art, but it&#39;s included in the set. The special part of this set is, that it has a king minifigure in it. Nowadays, you should need to buy 100&euro; set to get the&nbsp;king minifigure... Well, anyway like the flag, you can&#39;t see what coloured legs&nbsp;<em>(trousers)</em>&nbsp;the king wears. They are... - Blue. Weird choose, but it&#39;s kinda nice at the same time. I really love the shirt, that the king wears. It has the classic 90&#39;s lion logo in it. The details are also really great! I also like the sword too. It&#39;s chrome coloured. It&#39;s just sad that nowadays you don&#39;t really ever see any of these swords used, like never. Anyway the crown.... it&#39;s just a classic thing, which I got like at least 50 pcs. You can put a plume in it, if you want to. Then there is a big shield included too, which nowadays would never come in a set, this small. At least 20 bucks or something. Well... I wrote really long review <em>(idk if it&#39;s that good tho...)&nbsp;</em>for this small set, so I hope you will have a great day and... yeah, let me just quit already.</p>
