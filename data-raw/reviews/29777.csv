Now, in 2020 the LEGO Speed Champions Theme has received its very own Microscale build and it is quite brilliant. In point of fact it&rsquo;s really impressive. Let us discuss the pros and cons of the set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Very well put together model, fun to build, creative, captures the likeness very well.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Excellent piece-per-price ratio.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Great use of parts.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">No printed elements, includes sticker for detailing.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Not easily accessible at retail at this time.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;m very impressed with this model and it has inspired me to perhaps work harder at getting one of the Minifigure scale sets. I don&rsquo;t know cars, I am not an automotive expert, but I do enjoy LEGO vehicles. Many Creator Polybags have built excellent real-world vehicles at micro scale for fun builds and fun toys in general. Speed Champions takes a licensed vehicle and turns it into an excellent toy. Perfect for birthdays, good report cards or holidays. Highly Recommended.</p>

The build looks alright for it&#39;s size but has stickers for detailing instead of prints. I would have preferred printed pieces as this is a polybag, but I understand that most if not all Speed Champions sets use stickers as there would be a lot of detail to print, but this is a very small polybag and should at least include 1 print. The tyres on this car are pretty smooth and roll well so is good for play. I like the inclusion of the new metallic gold plates (included in some of the new Monkie Kid&nbsp;sets) as it makes the build look so much better.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is an okay poly bag, not bad, but not the best.</p>
