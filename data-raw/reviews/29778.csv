One from 2017 and this 2020 set. We have seen other four-wheeled Police Polybag sets, 4x4 vehicles and the like, but none of the sets are meant to be actual cars.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Model included is fast and easy to build.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Female Officer included as driver.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Car model seems rather box-like, not as streamlined or curved as the model could have been. Hindering aerodynamic look of the set.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">No proper sirens on Police Car Model.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Comparing the two models, the one from 2017 has a similar blocky design look making it less car-like than it could have been. That being said this is a pretty similar build to the 2017 model, so the two together match in appearance. It&rsquo;s a very decent little set, the problem is I&rsquo;m not very thrilled with these offerings. I&rsquo;d recommend it as a good special grade achieved present or something along those lines, but unless you&rsquo;re a Polybag completionist I feel you&rsquo;d get more out of a boxed set with a larger model to build compared to this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Somewhat Recommended.</p>
