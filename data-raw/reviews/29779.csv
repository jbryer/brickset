+ Cool minifig<br />
+ Nice colour scheme (dark stone grey vs. cool yellow, blue, white)<br />
+ Two pairs of handcuffs<br />
+ Decent chunk of bricks altogether</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong><br />
&mdash; A windshield is clunky and looks unfinished (<em>just one 1x2 flat tile/grille would&#39;ve fixed it</em>)<br />
&mdash; Propeller is a bit undecorated</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buying such a tiny polybag set, unless you&#39;re an age-appropriate child, is essentially just getting a minifig with a little chunk of bricks. But for this <strong>Police Helicopter</strong>, Lego actually did a fairly decent job squeezing as much playability and building fun as possible in it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>For $3-4 you&#39;re getting a fairly nice little pile of bricks, mostly multi-purpose and useful parts but with a few cool accessories and specialty ones as well. For instance, it comes with two pairs of handcuffs, very cool rotor blades on a snap, black walkie-talkie, a very useful 1x2 roof tile with a &#39;dashboard&#39; decal (btw, not necessarily a given for a polybag), etc.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, no 40-p set can provide a true 5/5 building experience, but this Copter certainly deserves solid four. In just 10 steps, the instructions still include some variety and even a couple of extra techniques with a technic cross axle holding the back rotor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The weakest spots here are, perhaps, an oversimplified landing gear&mdash;just a simple square plate, essentially, and it makes (an overall quite elegant) vehicle a bit clunky. As already mentioned, the windshield is not designed very well, even for such a simple build. The 2x5x2 Cockpit Glass w/ Shaft attaches to the cabin&#39;s nose under an awkward angle, it never looks or feels properly closed or &#39;snapped&#39; in place. Honestly, it would&#39;ve only taken 2-3 extra bricks to implement it much nicer, I am surprised Lego designers left it at this; even for a budget set. If we are nitpicking, perhaps the main rotor, which only had two blades, also could use a couple of extra grilles or decorative elements to cover two &#39;empty&#39; slots.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an AFOL, can&#39;t really judge the &#39;playability,&#39; but a &#39;flying cop&#39; minifigure is quite nice, and you can&#39;t really hate on how cute this little helicopter is. Trying to look at this through my own childhood eyes, or imagining an abstract 4-y.o. these days, I think I would be extremely excited to get such a set, whether I was already &#39;into&#39; City or any other Lego theme, or even a first-timer (really, a police helicopter is very universal, and you can blend it in literally ANY scene or build).</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-19T23:11:04.517Z","Helicopters Unite.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #30367 Police Helicopter:</b> LEGO has made 8 Helicopter based Polybags in LEGO City which are linked to the vast horde of LEGO City Police Themes &amp; Sub-Themes. Many of these sets are rather similar, a few are unique, and one of them isn&rsquo;t even an actual Helicopter. (See my review on the Swamp Police Helicopter Polybag.)</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">With this many Helicopter based Polybags in LEGO City, is this set worth picking up? Let&rsquo;s discuss the Pros and Cons to find out.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Solid looking model, easy to build, fun to play with.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Minifigure works well.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Model design nice evolution of some of the simpler Polybag Helicopters of the past.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Not as easy to find at retail in Canada.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Police Officer Minifigure has no unique parts.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The history of LEGO Police Helicopter Polybags is rather interesting, but I find the fact that we have had 8 and rarely do they shy away from the typical open-canopy small one-person scout craft design makes me question why I keep buying them. Then I remember my obsession with Polybags.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I think this is a pretty solid model though and a very nice set. Definitely one of the better options for Police Helicopter Polybags. If you can find it, I&rsquo;d recommend it, but if you&rsquo;re not as impressed with the plethora of LEGO City Police Helicopters out there, it&rsquo;s probably safe to skip.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Recommended.</p>
