But I was lucky enough to get one for christmas quite a few years back.  This set has ammor, two swords, a lance, a crossbow, a horse, and it sold for a great price.  Overall, a perfect single minifig set; I would have bought a ton more if I had the chance.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-05T14:25:34.03Z","build an army of decked out knights","After all, that's probably what this set is best for these days.  But hey, it's got the breastplate, best helmet (with the visor of course), dragon plumes, lance, sword, shield, crossbow, and of course our brickly hero is mounted on a black horse.  Definitely worth getting at least one for your Black Knights collection, and several more for playing with.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-03-28T13:23:58.373Z","Black knight","This small set, like some other small and also the called impulse sets, is one of these that have few pieces and buildings. But this have a good simple design. Including a nicely designed black knight minifigure, this set was released alongside with some sets of the castle theme and black knights subtheme. The minifigure also have a sword, a shield and a helmet, like some other used in castle sets, but with a piece that looks like a dragon above it. The horse is a black simple horse that carries the knight and a sword on the side. The set also includes other itens like the spear of joust combined with a flag and a crossbow, the both weapons are like the other few pieces of the set, useful. These two weapons stay above a black plate that is unnecesssary when the weapons are being used, but can complement something in your castle. Altough this have no much playability and new things, have a cheap price to increase a castle with a horse, a knight and weapons.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mngoult","2010-01-06T10:10:10.483Z","Its a guy and a horse but still good.","The titles sums this one up, the minifg is cool with dragon plumes and lots of weapons, it features two clipped saddle which is a shame.

If the horse had a decent barding it would be five stars as it stands a solid four, thanks in part to the good minifig, shield, dragon plumes and unusual head.

Pros
Weapons, shield and plumes.

Cons
No barding for horse.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is one of those small sets that more closer to be something like a minifigure collection or battle pack with what it offers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have the Black Knight wearing some of the then new style plate armor and helmets who's visors come down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like any good knight, he's got his horse with a saddle and a good assortment of weapons to choose from - swords, shield lance, crossbow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a good little set to have gotten either as impluse, stocking stuffer, Castle collection or army building.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,4,5
"Ernst","2011-07-15T16:48:52.037Z","Black Knight, a good addition","<p>It is a small set, you can built and own it if you have enough spare parts but collecting is about&nbsp;""really having it"". It is complete a nice additional set to own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building experience 3 bricks because there is not much to built but everything fits so 3 is sufficient here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts get 5 bricks because of the load of weapons this Knight owns, a regular one man army. Very good !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability gets 3 bricks for the set itself, you have to own other sets to really play with it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value depends why you buy it and in which condition. I bought it in great condition, with&nbsp; instructions as new&nbsp;and a reasonable box&nbsp;I paid €7,85 which is more than the average €5,85 Bricklink advises but in this condition and considering it was one of the few sets I missed it was worth it for me.</p>

"Pedro_Furlanetto","2014-07-03T17:45:01.783Z","My favorite knight","<p>For sure my favorite knight,with a red beard and a smile in face ready to combat and win. This set realesed&nbsp;in 1992 came with some news like beard and&nbsp;moustache,&nbsp;something&nbsp;use in pirates sets so long, and you can see in 6075 - Wolpack Tower (1992) too. Well, in some posters and catalogs you can see the 6009 - Black Knight fighting against wolfpack people.</p>

<p>4 or 5 of&nbsp;this and you have a powerful army. The&nbsp;stand&nbsp;of weapons can be transformed in a support for the crossbows and you can have a nice protect for your fortress or camp.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Nice little box with a nice pic of mighty Black Knight and the instructions are simply.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Parts&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Very nice parts with a brown lance, oval shield(1992) two clip bards (1992) a armor and a helmet with red dragon plumes.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Awesome minifigure&nbsp;with breast plate, old gray armor, red hips/black legs, old gray helmet with black pointed visor and red dragon plumes</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>A pretty add to a army or fighting lonely in medieval Lego&nbsp;Era. Is a awesome model with great pack of weapons.</p>
