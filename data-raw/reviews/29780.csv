+ Very nice minifig with full accessories<br />
+ Nice colour scheme<br />
+ Good playability for such a tiny set</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong><br />
&mdash; Light on the pieces<br />
&mdash; Oversimplified build</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong><br />
Hands down, the coolest feature of this City-themed <strong>Fire Rescue Water Scooter</strong>. A male firefighter sports a bright light orange jumpsuit with reflective stripes and neat graphics both on the upper and lower parts. Instead of a typical protective gear&mdash;a fireman&#39;s <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-3834"">mini helmet</a> with <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-3838"">oxygen bottles</a> and a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-6158"">smoke mask</a>&mdash;he wears just a regular white mini helmet. But the little guy also has a really cool <em>life jacket</em>, a.k.a &#39;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-38781"">mini clothing no. 9</a>.&#39; Certainly the first time I&#39;m seeing it, and in retrospect, it is perhaps my favourite part of the whole polybag. The vest was released a couple of years ago, and it&#39;s done very nicely, a completely new mold with perfect detailing. If I am not mistaken, it is still a fairly rare accessory, and there are not too many opportunities to get it outside much more expensive sets.</p>

<p>Finally, a <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-25167"">shooter</a>&mdash;technically, it&rsquo;s part of a vehicle in this set, but let&rsquo;s face it&mdash;this is soooo a weapon! It has a suitable handle and perfectly scaled to act as an accessory in hand. Conveniently finished in light grey too, instead of red, for instance, so this &#39;fire hydrant&#39; is really easy to hand over to any minifig across Lego worlds.</p>

<p>It shoots 1x1 round plates, and has a surprisingly high velocity. A piece will go flying at least 3 meters away, if not more, so aim carefully! A ball female joint at the opposite side of this awesome gun adds a lot of extra flexibility, whether as an alternative way to mount it or to add some decoration.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong><br />
Besides the minifigure, there is not too much to say about this set. Compared to other 2020 polybags, such as a <strong><a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/set-30367-1"">Police Helicopter</a></strong> I recently reviewed, it comes a bit light on parts, clocking at just 30 (if you exclude minifig parts). And the selection is not very impressive: not a single brick, just a few plates, inverted sloping roof tiles, and a few random bits.</p>

<p>On the bright side, the colour scheme is very nice, this mild contrast of dark stone grey and cool yellow works every time for me. The nose of the scooter (which consists of just two parts) is finished in red, obviously, and has a Fire Station logo decal.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong><br />
Really nothing is going on here, and the whole build will only take 2-3 minutes even for a fairly slow and inexperienced 5y.o. builder. My first initial reaction to the stripped floor and a total lack of any decoration or a seat was of disappointment.</p>

<p>But after all, I realized this was actually a quite good design solution. First off, it allows the fireman to both sit or stand on the scooter, just like in real life. All the empty space behind his back can be used for a passenger or any extra gear or tools. Also, it can be used to store the fire aim (a single flame piece on the mini-parabola stand) when not in use.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong><br />
Actually, very decent on this set, despite the tiny size and primitive scooter design, mainly due to an actionable fire hydrant and a little fire aim included. Plenty of room on the scooter for two minifigures too.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Look &amp; Feel</strong><br />
Must hand it to Lego designers&mdash;with such a limited inventory, they really made this scooter looks very nice.</p>

"Sideswipe2","2020-11-07T19:38:04.16Z","Nice little distraction","<p>Picked up this little set at a local store as a distraction while waiting for a larger LEGO order, and was quite pleased with it.</p>

<p>The Minifigure included is well done, and while it only has a single sided face, it does have nice leg and back printing, along with the helmet/visor and life jacket Elements, which make it, in my opinion, worth the price of this in itself.</p>

<p>The build of the set is decent, and fairly sleek looking as you would expect of a water scooter, especially like the firefighter emblem printed on the slope piece (no stickers here), the Shooter (though not sure if it was regional or not, but mine came with the shooter and trigger already assembled, so it did not have a trigger as an extra piece), and the Cool Yellow/Bright Light Yellow, pieces that you just don&#39;t see that much of (I&#39;ve actually seen more Flaming Yellowish Orange pieces, than Cool Yellow, other than in Wigs). I also like the use of the 1x1 round plates with holes on the back to represent the &ldquo;jets&rdquo; of the scooter. The little fire on the Black (possibly an oil drop) piece was an understandable inclusion so there is something to put out, though could see it be easily lost since it doesn&#39;t attach to anything. Over all, like with the Minifigure, I was very pleased with the over all build and pieces included.</p>

<p>On playability, I&#39;m an adult collector, but could easily see this integrating in several areas, especially if the child has any type of water theme to their city sets. The scooter is large enough to even hold another standing Minifigure behind the included one, which I feel is always nice and allows further playability with other sets. Of course the stud shooter always adds to this. Not sure if it actually floats in water, as I try to avoid getting my LEGO&#39;s wet when possible. Again, only downside is the little fire build being possibly easy to lose.</p>

<p>On the whole, I was very pleased with this purchase, especially as I did not really expect to get such a nice selection in a set I literally picked up on impulse to relieve the waiting. It&#39;s small and would possibly make a good stocking stuffer for a fan of LEGO City or a child who already has LEGO.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-19T23:13:34.647Z","The Dock is on Fire!","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #30368 Fire Rescue Water Scooter:</b> Compared to LEGO City Police, LEGO City Fire hasn&rsquo;t received nearly as many Polybags with similar models, there have been some, but not a lot. Case in point, this Fire Rescue Polybag features a small scooter for fire fighting on ships and near the shoreline. We&rsquo;ve seen exactly three water based sets from LEGO City, this set, the Fire Boat from 2007 and the Speedboat from 2013.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Quick buildable model with stud-shooting action.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Great looking choice for Minifigure with helmet and life-vest accessory.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">&nbsp;Just over 30 pieces. Fairly small compared to other LEGO City Polybags.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I like this set, but it&rsquo;s still fairly plain compared to some of the more unique offerings LEGO city has had. I&rsquo;m really looking forward to getting the Diver Polybag with Ray animal. I&rsquo;d recommend this over the Police Car though, it&rsquo;s more fun overall and has a nicer looking model. Definitely worth picking up. Recommended.</p>
