<p>This set only has one minifig and it is the surfer guy. He can either drive the beach buggy or ride on the surf board. This minifig has good surfer hair, A face with only one expression witch I do not like. I think this minifig has a lew print for&nbsp;his body, but&nbsp;I do not know, he also has sand blue legs.</p>

<h2>Build</h2>

<p>The build on this set is pretty simple, but I like it. The beach buggy has red wheels and I think that is cool. On the back of the buggy you can attach the surf board. You can put the minifig in the seat and make him drive it.</p>

<h2>My opinion</h2>

<p>This is a nice promotional&nbsp;set. If you cold not get it for free you can still get it for cheap. I recommend&nbsp;this set.</p>

It was offered as a GWP this summer from LEGO Shop &amp; Home and so chances are you&rsquo;ll have multiples of it.</p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Very nice looking model with a simple and quick build.</li>
