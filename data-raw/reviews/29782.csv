I also own the set 30278 Poe&#39;s X-Wing Fighter and this one is better than that (And I really liked that one as well). I would have preferred similar colors to 30278 but I do like how the blue and orange work nicely together with this X-Wing.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Box/Instructions:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Comes in a polybag with normal polybag sized instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You get some really good parts in this set, especially for a polybag. You get 4 dark grey ski poles and 4 carrots. You also get some orange and a few light blue parts as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy it took a few minutes to build. The technique for the engines was really cool. The way the front of the ship connects to the back of the ship was another good technique as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great X-Wing fighter. The use of the ski poles as cannons was a great use of the piece. The technique for the engines was also really good (especially for a polybag). This is another great polybag done by Star Wars. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

Along with these&nbsp;pieces, there is&nbsp;a total of&nbsp;72 pieces. The white, blue, and orange&nbsp;color scheme only makes the x-wing look more awesome.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The usually price is $4.99, but I was able to get a number of these polybags at Walmart for $3. We used them in a timed building contest, and the family had a great time. You could either buy one or a few, use for a showpiece or have a build off. Either way, you will be glad that you owe this set.&nbsp;This microscale build is a must-buy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
