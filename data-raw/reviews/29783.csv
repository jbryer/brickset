<p>The set has 2 minifigs and comes with 22 parts. The set got releassed in 2020 as second minecradft polybag.</p>

<p>Minifigs:</p>

<p>Teh two minifgs coming in this set are Alex and a skeleton. Both of the minifigs arent exclusive with this, but the selection is good.</p>

<p>Parts:</p>

<p>As said in the other review the parts are cool, but the build not so. I partet it out and used the parts for MOCs. I think so there in better use, also because there isnt to much playabilty, but every one can do what he wants.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>Good minifigs, cool parts and low price, a must buy.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Includes Skeleton and Alex Minifigures as well as appropriate tools for combat/defense.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Small model built includes flick-fire missile for defense and some carrots starting to grow in perhaps.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Decent parts-per-piece ratio</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">No unique printed Minecraft bricks.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is an excellent little Polybag, it is great abundance at Wal-Marts around Canada and so should be picked up when seen. The parts are quite useful and the Minifigures look great. Overall a very solid offering from Minecraft. Recommended.</p>

<p>The set comes with some vegetation for kids to claim in their Lego Minecraft harvesting and the flick missile is fun for kids.&nbsp; The rest of it is very basic.</p>

<p>This polybag is a great deal at $5 for two minifigs and some extra Lego pieces thrown in.&nbsp; On that basis alone, I would recommend it.</p>
