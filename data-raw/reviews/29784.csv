The difference here is that it includes more Valentine&rsquo;s themed builds, which is quite fitting. It&rsquo;s a very imaginative design and I really love the builds here.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Models are very great. Love the builds and enjoy everything about these models, they look quite unique and very impressive.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Parts quite impressive as well.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Build relies on parts, not stickers.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Difficult to locate at retail in Canada.</li>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I enjoy this set quite a lot it&rsquo;s not for everybody though. Some builders might prefer Mini-Dolls and models for them to interact with, but these types of sets from Friends really pull off a lot of decent ideas. It&rsquo;s like a more specific version of some of the Creator sets. Pretty impressive. Highly recommended.</p>

It is a small Friends set with a flower and a box of chocolate. The box of chocolate is very well-designed and the lid of the box can come off to reveal the small chocolate builds. The flower is good too although could use more detail. This set is good for display as it looks good on shelves/desks and is good for role-playing as it is more human size than minifigure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall a nice polybag with bright colours and is good for displaying and role-playing</p>
