<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Great looking model.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Olivia included as the Mini-Doll.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Brand new bird pieces found inside. Two of them.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Fun for play.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">LEGO Bicycle is not compatible with Mini-Doll hand placement, LEGO continues to ignore the need for a new bike element for Mini-Dolls.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Andrea falls off bench easily.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a great LEGO set from LEGO Friends and I would definitely recommend it. But I do still think LEGO is failing to capitalize on the opportunity to make a new bike piece specifically for Mini-Dolls, the handlebars cannot be held onto here and it is demonstrating unsafe bike riding habits. Of course it is just a toy. Still though, LEGO should be working to make a better element. Overall though I&rsquo;d still recommend it.</p>

<p>Parts are great. Building experience was ok. Playability is meh. Price is good for the stuff in here. A better Olivia polybag.</p>
