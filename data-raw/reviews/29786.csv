But along with getting a new DC Mini-figure of a Green Lantern I figured why not. The best part of set is it comes with two Mini-figures, one of a young Nick Fury probably the only down side is you might wish his second &quot;face&quot; has an eye patch. As for the second figure Captain Marvel one might wish her legs actually has some printing on them. As for the &quot;main&quot; build it self it is pretty straight forward with plenty of printed parts, one not to obvious is the &quot;VHS tape tile&quot;. And the set comes with an extra &quot;keypad / calculator&quot;&nbsp; 1x1 tile for Mr. Fury to hold while he is ready to shoot at someone with his gun that comes in the set. Along with another printed tile for some radio control being that this set is some sort of phone booth.</p>

<p>So, an okay set to get two Mini-figures especially if you don&#39;t have either characters. Plus a couple of printed titles and accessories for said Mini-figures.&nbsp;</p>

Two minifigs, and 4 different printed parts (5, including the extra piece) and a cool little quick build? You really can&#39;t go wrong with this set for the price. I&#39;m going to get a few more, just for the pieces.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">It took me most of 2020 to finally find this at a retail store, that being said it is a highly desirable Polybag and I would whole heartedly recommend it, it includes some great difficult to find Minifigures at a fraction of the cost and the only thing that would make it perfect is if they&rsquo;d included a Goose to go with the duo here.

<p>Comes in polybag with normal polybag size instructions.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This set has great pieces in it (especially for a polybag). You get 4 printed pieces: VHS tape, keypad, control panel, and a 1x2 slope brick as the phone keys. You also get a walkie-talkie and a dark grey phone. You get the tesseract and the glass piece is also really cool. Overall great piece haul for a polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Nick Fury:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>You get a young Nick Fury.&nbsp;He has a doubled sided face. On one side he has a slight grin on it and on the other is a more serious a little angry looking expression. He has a white shirt with straps on both sides of his torso. On the back they are connected. On the front left strap is a holster for his gun. He has plain black legs. He is armed with a dark grey gun.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Captain Marvel:</strong></p>

<p>Captain&nbsp;Marvel is in her Kree suit. The printing on her body is great. The detail is very accurate to her Kree suit in the movie. She has printing on the front and back of her torso. She has plain dark blue legs. She has a doubled sided face. On one side she has a more serious face and on the other a smile. She also has dark blonde hair.&nbsp;&nbsp;She also has trans orange power blast. You get two of them in the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong></p>

<p>The build was quick and easy, it took me a few minutes to build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Opinion:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Overall this is a great polybag. Getting two minifigures along with the great piece haul is very nice&nbsp;for a polybag. The figures are really good. I believe this is the first Captain Marvel figure with her Kree suit so that alone was worth it. Nick Fury was another great figure to get as well. The figures or the pieces alone are worth getting this set for. I highly recommend getting this set whether it is for the pieces or the figures or both. Overall I&#39;m giving it a 5-star rating.&nbsp;</p>

"Isj_rocks","2020-05-14T23:54:16.73Z","A great polybag for those who missed the original set","<p><strong>Introduction:&nbsp;</strong>I spent a long time searching for the original Captain Marvel set, admiring the minifigures and the Quinjet build. Eventually, I gave up after the Endgame set photos were released. I was sad to say the least, it ended my MCU streak. I figured I&rsquo;d never get another chance, then the Comic-con photos came out, like a nail in the coffin. I believed I&rsquo;d never see either Captain Marvel figure in person. This, you can imagine, hyped up this polybag before it&rsquo;s existence. Let&rsquo;s take a deeper look at it.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures:&nbsp;</strong>The Captain Marvel figure is absolutely the selling point of the entire set so let&rsquo;s look at that first. The torso has impeccable detail on both sides, but sadly lacks arm printing and leg detail. I&rsquo;m happy that the orange power blasts were included here instead of the blue ones which were inaccurate to the film. The young Nick Fury here is the same from the original set. I do wish it had detailed leg printing, but it is film accurate with the black pants. He also includes a classic dark grey gun piece. If I was asked to make this set better in this category, I would switch the Young Nick Fury for a Young Phil Coulson or maybe a Skrull variant.</p>

<p><strong>Build: </strong>The phone booth build here is wonderful and packed with fun items from the movie such as Nick Fury&rsquo;s pager, a VHS tape, and the Tesseract. The nice yellow and grey color scheme is very accurate and a nice touch in general. My problems with the build begin with its clunky form. With all the random knickknacks on the top and the Tesseract at it&rsquo;s side, it really has a strange weight to it. My second issue with the build is that it isn&rsquo;t minifigure scale, the figures when placed on the booths stand can&rsquo;t see through the window, or reach any items from the top.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion: </b>I really like parts of this set. It&rsquo;s an easy way to obtain the&nbsp;minifigures and the build contains some rare parts. The polybag was great because of the minifigures, but missed the mark on aspects of the build. This set is definitely worth picking up for the minifigures alone though in my opinion, so that&rsquo;s my review!</p>

"PerryThePlatypus","2020-12-11T16:51:37.257Z","A Must Own Polybag for any Marvel fan","<p>This polybag obviously caught many people by surprise as it contained a (now former) exclusive minifigure found in an SDCC exclusive set&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/77902-1/Captain-Marvel-and-the-Asis"">Captain Marvel and the Asis</a>. I got pretty excited about the possibility of getting a rare blue uniform Captain Marvel figure, the problem was, polybags are pretty difficult to stumble across in South Africa. But then out of the blue, I suddenly found it in some toy store, a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one.</p>

<h3>The Build</h3>

<p><strong>The Phone Booth:</strong> This phone booth build is based off the one that appeared in the movie. Starting from the bottom of the build, there&rsquo;s a 1 x 1 trans light blue brick to the right of the build that represents the Tesseract, which was a great piece to include here. There&rsquo;s a printed sloped brick that has the keypad print on it, which is a pretty old print, but still a nice one to get, and next to it is the telephone piece in grey attached to a clip. A fairly large clear windscreen piece is used here, and that&rsquo;s yet another great part included here. The top of the phone booth has quite a few pieces to represent retro technology, like a 1 x 1 tile keypad print (which they give you an extra of), a common 1 x 2 control panel print, a walk-talkie, and finally, the best piece in this set other than Captain Marvel&rsquo;s torso, an uncommon 1 x 2 printed tile of a VHS tape, which was only other found in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75935-1/Baryonyx-Face-Off-The-Treasure-Hunt"">Baryonyx Face-Off: The Treasure Hunt</a>, and also more recently in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21324-1/123-Sesame-Street"">123 Sesame Street,</a>&nbsp;I adore this print and I really appreciate the inclusion of this piece here. Overall, this is a cute little build that&rsquo;s relevant to the movie, and it consists of some great pieces, nice stuff.</p>

<h3>The Minifigs&nbsp;</h3>

<p><strong>Captain</strong> <strong>Marvel</strong> (<strong>Kree Starforce Uniform):</strong> Here we have the obvious main draw for a lot of people to get this polybag. Starting from the legs, it&rsquo;s just in plain dark blue... I usually find it strange that even with a con exclusive set, Lego could cheap out with their lack of leg printing with some of their figures, I mean, they didn&rsquo;t even give it dual-molded legs, which kinda sucks. After you get past the legs, you could clearly see that the torso is easily the best part of the figure, this rare torso print represents the suit that Carol wore in the earlier parts of the movie. As for the print itself, it&rsquo;s a dark blue suit with a silver star, and medium azure patterns which were also continued at the back. It&rsquo;s a really good torso print, although it definitely could&rsquo;ve used some arm printing, but no big deal. The face prints include a neutral expression and a smile for the alternate face, and they work fine for the character. The hair piece used here is the short female hair swept sideways in medium nougat, which is a nice color to get it in, but I don&rsquo;t really like the specific use of this piece for the character as it looks very inaccurate to how her hair looked like in the movie, but it&rsquo;s not a huge issue. Finally, her accessories are the 2 power blast pieces in trans-orange which are exclusive to this set, and I&rsquo;m really happy that Lego corrected the color of her energy blasts. Overall, I&rsquo;m not overly impressed with this figure and it definitely could&rsquo;ve been better, I still like it though and it isn&rsquo;t bad by any means. I&lsquo;m more so really impressed with the choice of putting in a rare figure from an SDCC set, and with that aspect alone, how can I possibly dislike this figure?</p>

<p><strong>Nick Fury:</strong> The Young Nick Fury that appears in this set is the same one that comes in<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76127-1/Captain-Marvel-and-The-Skrull-Attack"">&nbsp;Captain Marvel and The Skrull Attack</a>. Starting from the legs, it&rsquo;s just in plain black, I mean, this is a Marvel Minifigure, what do you expect? The torso print is a white shirt with a black tie, a gray belt and a gray shoulder holster, and it has some back printing for the continuation of the belt and the shoulder holster straps, which is nice. His face prints include a raised eyebrow smirk expression and a stern/angry one for the alternate expression, these prints are pretty uncommon and they&rsquo;re the ones that were introduced with the 2017 Justice League movie Cyborg, and... they work well enough for a young Nick Fury. His hair piece is a black one that was first introduced with Finn in the Star Wars line, and it&rsquo;s a nice hair piece to get in general. Finally his accessory is a 2 barrel gun piece in gray. Overall, I&rsquo;m happy with the inclusion of this figure here since I didn&rsquo;t really have interest in the Captain Marvel and The Skrull Attack set, and I&rsquo;m glad I got him in an alternative way.</p>

<h3>Value For Money</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ve seen some people point this out, and I&rsquo;m going to also. It seems pretty laughable that in the US, a single CMF now costs 5 bucks, and this polybag, which contains TWO minifigures, one which was previously a Con exclusive minifigure mind you, AND a good build, all for the same price... sounds pretty shocking huh? With all that said, this set has fantastic value, 2 minifigs in a 5 dollar polybag is just amazing, and this is another example of a relatively cheap set&rsquo;s price making CMFs look like a joke.</p>

<h3>Overall Opinion&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This is a nice little set that not only has great figures and a fantastic value, but a surprisingly good build for a polybag with great pieces to be found. There&rsquo;s also the extremely welcome inclusion of that rare Captain Marvel minifigure and Young Nick Fury, and while they&lsquo;re both far from the most highly detailed figures (they are Marvel minifigures after all), they&rsquo;re still pretty cool and I really appreciate the fact that they&rsquo;re available in a cheap polybag. And obviously I need to talk a bit more about the fact that a con exclusive figure is put into such a cheap set, because people often complain that these highly desirable figures aren&rsquo;t widely available to most people in the world, and now with the existence of this polybag, it&rsquo;s a huge step in the right direction for Lego, and it really makes me hope that we&rsquo;d see more polybags like this one in the future. If you&rsquo;re a fan of Marvel, you should definitely snag one of these if you come across it. I&rsquo;d give this a 9/10 overall and I highly recommend it.</p>
