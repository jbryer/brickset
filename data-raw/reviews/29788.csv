"Minifig290","2020-10-25T22:32:03.753Z","Nice way to end off a great theme","<p>Hello there, today I will be taking a look at one of the many 2020 polybags and on of two Hidden Side polys the 30464 El Fuego&#39;s Stunt Cannon that was released in 2020. This set was given away during the 2020 Halloween season at LEGO Shop with purchases over &pound;35/$35 it was also sold in the UK at ASDA stores in a polybag mix tray for &pound;3.47. This set contains 46 pieces giving it a price per piece of 7p, and if sold in the US this would have been around $5 so its price per piece would be 10c.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s take a look at this little set.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Included with the set is an exclusive variant of El Fuego in his skeletal shape, he is exclusive as he lacks the cape and head print he had in the 70429 El Fuego&#39;s Stunt Plane that was released in Jan 2020.</p>

<p>Instead of the head print that the plane set has this version of El Fuego&#39;s skeleton has a bog standard skeleton head print that has been used in 69 sets to date so is very common. His body has the pretty easy to find skeleton body piece with two of the again common skeleton arms in all in white.</p>

<p>The only pieces that are really hard to find, as non are exclusive, are his read hat that has only been in four sets all from the Hidden Side theme, this red biker helmet piece has a print for a target with some green flames on top. Finally, for the figure he has two Nexo Knight Bot legs in white and black which only come in this and the 70429.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>The main focus of the set is the Stunt Cannon build that uses the rest of the pieces, this is built in two sections. The first section is the base that has four of the smaller wheels all connected onto two 2x2 wheelbases. On top of the wheelbases are some plates including a 1x2 dark grey tile with a handle for El Fuego to drag around his cannon when his not being flung out of it. Above all that are some more plates with some clips for some trans-orange flame pieces and then finally the most important angling feature that uses the newish minifigure shield piece that was first released in the 2017 First Order Battle Pack, this time it&#39;s in a dark red colour.</p>

<p>Placed on the shield piece is the actual cannon build, this build is built around a black engine piece that has two&nbsp;light grey studded technic pins on each side with a 1x3 dark red tile. Inside the engine piece is a small and simple launching build that uses a 2x2 lime dome brick with a 2x2 round tile placed on the end of a 5M light grey technic axle with a small yellow 1/2 yellow bush on the other end inside the engine that stop the build falling out the engine pieces.</p>

<p>Finally, on top of the engine piece is a 2x2 round jumper tile with a small trans-orange flame piece next to a 1x2 red grill piece.</p>

<p><strong>Play Feature</strong></p>

<p>When El Fuego is placed inside the cannon, admittedly not very well, then push the lever from the back it will throw El out of the cannon. Depending on how hard you hit the lever he can go decently far. To get the best results I suggest moving El&#39;s arms upwards, so he can get further into the cannon so when flung he has more power.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Well, not a bad set. OK it isn&#39;t the greatest but not bad. The play feature which is most important in a set like this works pretty well, although a little underwhelming in its power. Pieces and the minifigure in the set are alright with some nice piece which are fairly uncommon such as El&#39;s helmet and legs which are both exclusive to Hidden Side.</p>

<p>I think this set will make a nice little gift or stocking filler but I wouldn&#39;t urge you to go out of your way to get this polybag as good as it is. It is a nice freebie from LEGO and a nice way to see off the Hidden Side theme which was liked my the majority from what I saw.</p>

<p><strong>Pros -</strong> Decent selection of pieces, entertaining building experience, play feature works well enough, good price and promo</p>

<p><strong>Cons - </strong>Would have liked El to have had his face print which was included in the 70429 released at the same time</p>

<p>As a free GWP for &pound;35, I like it, but I wouldn&#39;t go out of my way to buy it. It&#39;s a great low-spend way to get some more bricks, and a pretty cool skeleton figure. I got it when buying some Christmas items, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40368-1/Xmas-Accessories"">40368-1</a>, <a aria-describedby=""ui-tooltip-1"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/854037-1/Christmas-Ornament-Santa"">854037-1</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40424-1/Winter-Snowball-Fight"">40424-1</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60268-1/City-Advent-Calendar"">60268-1</a>. Expect reviews soon!!</p>

<p>The build is simple, using an aircraft engine as the main cannon body. It took me approximately 2 minutes to complete the build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are some nice parts, such as the part&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4295395/jet-engine-4x5x3"">4295395</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6275595/mini-crash-helmet-no-18"">6275595</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As far as playability is concerned, this is pretty rubbish. The cannon fires out very weakly, and almost topples over on itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a great addition to a Hidden Side collector&#39;s scene, but I myself will be parting this out into my collection of bricks.&nbsp;</p>
