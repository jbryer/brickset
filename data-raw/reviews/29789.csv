"BrickRandom","2020-11-11T09:38:41.597Z","Not as good looking as the picture","<p>I picked&nbsp;up this polybag at a local drugstore for &euro; 2,99. I have never watched NinjaGo, but the car looked ok in the picture and at this price it got me some 70 pieces (plus spares) for around 4 cents per piece.</p>

<p>The build is (as expected for such a small set) quite simple. The front, sides and back use some SNOT as you often see in little cars builds. Building the car is&nbsp;a matter of minutes.</p>

<p>There are a few parts which are a welcome addition to my (currently very&nbsp;small) LEGO collection, such as the swords, nozzles, hinges, fancy wheels and rounded plates.</p>

<p>The main thing that strikes me about this car, though, is that once built, it is quite ugly. As said, I have never seen any NinjaGo, so I don&#39;t know what this is supposed to represent so it might be a good rendition of some vehicle in the series. But&nbsp;just as a car to build and look at, I don&#39;t like it. The picture on the polybag probably the only ok&nbsp;angle, so the real thing doesn&#39;t quite meet my expectation.&nbsp;Some other small polybag builds are kept around my desk, but this one is going straight into the &#39;to be taken apart and sorted later&#39;&nbsp;box.</p>

<p>So, overall: some nice parts at a low price, but not a pretty thing to look at.</p>

A buildable two-in-one model featuring the Combo Charger, which&hellip; source material wise I&rsquo;m drawing a blank on. I forget which season it was used in. It&rsquo;s one of Kai&rsquo;s vehicles though. This polybag&rsquo;s pros and cons are next, then final thoughts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Excellent vehicle build.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Two-In-One model can be rebuilt from car into plane.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Excellent parts-per-piece ratio.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Not available at most retailers yet.</li>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I&rsquo;m pretty impressed with the models in this set. I like the car, while the plane mode is rather interesting too. It&rsquo;s just a shame LEGO did not make this a transforming model, but at this scale I can understand why they&rsquo;d only have the option for a 2-in-1 build. I&rsquo;d recommend picking this up if you can find it in stores. It&rsquo;s a pretty nice model, the colours are great and the gold katana are always welcome in any set. Recommended.</p>
