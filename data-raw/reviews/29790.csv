The cart wheels are great and the cart itself requires a bit more assembly than one might think. The cart itself has a whole load of translucent weapons and a couple of odd coloured fish.</p>

<p>It is however more than weird that they gave Jay a dual sided head without a hair piece to cover up the &#39;non-used&#39; side. I don&#39;t understand why such design passes the approval stage.</p>

<p>They should have gone with a hair piece or with just a single sided head.<br />
So great buy as set but you do need to swap out the head.</p>

This Polybag has a lot of decent weapons and other accessories, however it isn&rsquo;t very exciting for the main build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Cheapest available set with the unique looking Minifigure game controller weapon accessory.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Decent selection of weapons in trans-clear Classic Space Green.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Nicely detailed Jay Minifigure.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Quick to build model.</li>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Wagon Model isn&rsquo;t terribly exciting.</li>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I enjoy LEGO Ninjago very much, though I haven&rsquo;t collected a load of sets, that being said the Polybags are usually pretty decent, and while the model here is a bit weak and there are no generic villains for Jay to fight with, the fact that the arsenal here and the parts more than make up for the limited use of the model and Minifigure. Recommended.</p>
