I personally got mine for &pound;2.60 from eBay which tbh isn&#39;t bad, anyway this set has 26 pieces and assuming. LEGOLAND stores have it this would retail for around &pound;5 so giving a price per part of 19p. Let&#39;s take a look as what included.</p>

<p>- 1x1 plate with beak, Light orange (Qty x1)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Suggested Builds</strong></p>

<p>On the bag there are 3 pictures of some suggested builds, but a word of warning only one can be built at once.</p>

<p>The three builds are just some small birds that look alright. With the parts included I managed to build my own bird taking some inspirations from the suggested builds. But before I talk about my versions ideas lets just take a brief look at the suggested ones a bit more.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion 1.</strong></p>

<p>A small bird using the Croissant pieces for its feathery wings, great part usage. I also like its long neck using both th 1x1 lime studs.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion 2.</strong></p>

<p>A larger bird, maybe likening it to a swan is by best guess. A very colourful bird using the most parts, including all three 1x1 bricks with studs on all sides. In my eyes i don&#39;t see any interesting techniques or part usage on this one quite a easy build.</p>

<p><strong>Suggestion 3.</strong></p>

<p>Finally, a tall bird, using a quite tame colour scheme compared to the others, a very tropical looking bird with its dark azur wings and dark green belly and pink beak. This one too uses all three 1x1 bricks with studs on all sides</p>

<p><strong>Some building ideas.</strong></p>

<p>Now as this one of those sets that are about being creative imma give you some little ideas on some techniques that can be done with the parts included.</p>

<p><strong>Wings.</strong></p>

<p>Making some interesting wings in this set is fun, there are a few ways of making them such as using the Ice Pops attached into a 1x1 brick with studs on all sides, or using the cheese slops on each side.</p>

<p><strong>Beak.</strong></p>

<p>Using the 1x1 cone bricks could make some nice beaks, so could the ice pops if your very imaginative.</p>

<p><strong>Heads.</strong></p>

<p>There are man ways to make the head, either a fat or thin, flat or wide head they can all be done. The 1x1 plate with beak extension is a very good piece. The 1x1 brick with studs on all sides are the best for fat and bulky heads with lots of detail, the 2x2 plate could make a really fat face, XD.</p>

<p><strong>Body.</strong></p>

<p>There are a lot of pieces to make different bodies of different sizes, the range of plates is great from the 2x2 plate to the 1x3 they can all make some great body templates, also some SNOT techniques with the 1x1 bricks with studs on all sides and the azur angled plates.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Well, what else do i need to say. A great small set that can build a lot. This set has a great variety of parts in hard to find colours, i personally love the food parts included such as the Croissant as that is a fairly uncommon piece in white and i love the ice pops inclusion. A range of colours as well from pink to green, orange to blue this set has a ton of vibrant colours and only one dull coloured piece the 2x2 brown plate but that is still a great part to have more of.</p>

<p>I highly recommend this set to any newcomers in the LEGO community if they can get this for a reasonable price on ebay, this set is about a couple of pounds rn so not an expensive purchase. This set would make a perfect stocking filler for Christmas 2020 or a little treat for your kids and even yourself :).</p>

<p><strong>Pros - </strong>Great parts, unusual selection of parts, perfect set to spark imagination, great after market price for buyers.</p>

<p><strong>Cons -</strong> Maybe one or two more ideas, and i would have liked maybe one more eye option to have some choice from, but these cons are just nitty picky.</p>

"BJNemeth","2020-03-08T12:10:48.703Z","This Polybag Is a Delightful Surprise","<p>I bought this polybag for a whopping $6 at a Legoland Discovery Center in Atlanta, Georgia (USA). The price was high, but I love packing a few Lego polybags when I travel, and this looked like an intriguing set that I hadn&#39;t seen anywhere else. (Building&nbsp;and displaying a&nbsp;small Lego creation&nbsp;when I travel&nbsp;makes a hotel room feel more like home to me.)</p>

<p>This polybag&nbsp;only has 26 pieces, and I didn&#39;t expect much from this set because I usually prefer minifig-scale builds. But this set quickly won me over.</p>

<p>This polybag was absolutely delightful. The seven suggested birds in the &quot;instructions&quot;&nbsp;cover a wide range of species&nbsp;using the same basic pieces, and the finished birds all looked good. It&#39;s a shame that you can only build one at a time, but that&#39;s to be expected&nbsp;with&nbsp;only 26 pieces.</p>

<p>I put &quot;instructions&quot; in quotation marks because there are none of the usual&nbsp;step-by-step instructions. There are three starter birds that give you a look at the finished build and another look that shows the core structure. But that&#39;s enough for anyone above a very young age with Lego-building experience to figure out. After those first three builds, there are pictures of four more birds that can easily be figured out as well, especially after building the first three.</p>

<p>I thought this polybag&nbsp;would be a five-minute build, but I lost track of time as I built a bird, took it apart, built another one, and kept going. Building all of the&nbsp;different birds that Lego provided photos for&nbsp;gets the creative juices flowing, and it&#39;s easy to start experimenting with new birds of your own. (And if you have more pieces, it would be even more fun to swap in&nbsp;different colors and pieces.)</p>

<p>Note: I always have a Lego Brick Separator handy, and it was useful for removing the 1x1 round plates when they attached to the bottom of another piece.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a parts guy, but this set does include two white croissant pieces that look great in that color, and they are used in only one of the builds to represent feathered wings. (The bird with the croissant-wings happens to be my favorite.)</p>

<p>This has instantly become one of my favorite&nbsp;Lego&nbsp;polybags, and I&#39;d like to get my hands on a few more&nbsp;if I can find them at a good price (or at least some more of the pieces)&nbsp;so I can display multiple birds at a time.</p>
