"Odeinoichus","2020-12-30T22:57:18.717Z","Somewhat disappointing Animal Selection.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #30554 Cinderella Mini Castle: </b>Disney Princess Polybags seem to be dominated by Cinderella, she&rsquo;s appeared in two while other Princesses have rarely been included in Polybags, outside of her we have Elsa, Rapunzel and that&rsquo;s pretty much it. I think I would have preferred a Tiana or somebody not frequently seen. Still we&rsquo;ll go over the pros and cons of this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Really great looking model, miniature castle includes nods to the film including Pumpkin and small gold lantern similar to what is on a coach or carriage.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Mini-Doll looks great. Impressive print and design.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Wonderful selection of parts including printed tower element and two dark blue ice-cream cones.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Animal Friend is not an actual Disney Mouse animal, but a re-use of the LEGO Friends gerbil/hamster animal piece, which looks nothing like the animation models of Jacque or Gus-Gus.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Slightly difficult to find at retail currently.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I enjoyed this set, but feel a different princess should have been included. Also, Ariel gets to have unique animal sculpts for Flounder and Sebastian, while Elsa and Anna have Olaf and Merida got her brothers as bears, but LEGO decided not to make one of the two mice from the actual animation? I seriously think this hamster piece looks out of place here because it is so obviously not Cinderella&rsquo;s mouse friend. I would recommend this set mostly for the parts, as they are quite useful. Slightly Recommended.</p>
