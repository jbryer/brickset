"Odeinoichus","2021-11-07T13:37:29.52Z","A Trollish Delight","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #30555 Poppy&rsquo;s Carriage:</b> Rather than rely on their now defunct Kre-O line, Hasbro teamed up with LEGO for the sequel to Trolls, the Dreamworks movie based on the Hasbro doll toyline. This Polybag was a GWP in the spring when the launch of the Theme occurred, unfortunately due to events of 2020 the film itself did not release in Theatres. However LEGO has done a decent job promoting the movie in these sets.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Nice selection of teal elements.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Fun model to build.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Brand new musical note pieces included.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Cheapest method to acquire main character Poppy.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Troll&rsquo;s Hair Element not compatible with regular LEGO Minifigures.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Trolls is a Theme that isn&rsquo;t for everybody. I, personally, am not fully interested in the entire theme, but I do like collecting Polybags and this particular model introduces all of the new ideas and elements that the Theme overall includes. So as an introduction to Trolls it looks great.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">If you&rsquo;re a fan of the Theme or the Movie you&rsquo;ll probably want to collect this entire Theme and get this set too. Overall though I&rsquo;d only recommend it for fans, anyone else can safely skip this set. And if you were curious about the new hair elements, sad to say, this Theme does not allow for Troll Hair to attach to regular Minifigure heads.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Recommended for fans.</p>
