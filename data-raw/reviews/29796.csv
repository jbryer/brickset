This particular model is quite attractive looking reminding me of an old steam locomotive. The colouring is a nice touch too. Let&rsquo;s discuss the pros and cons real quick and then move on to final thoughts.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Fun and enjoyable build.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Model looks sharp and well designed with proper proportions and decent mobility. Rolls very well.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Includes a hitch, but no trailer/coal cart to tow.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set has surprisingly few cons, it&rsquo;s fun to build and fun to play with. The only downside I could find was not include a secondary car for the engine to tow, but it was nice that they included the piece so you could make your own as a functional model to add to the play functions of the set. I&rsquo;d recommend tracking this one down to add it to your collection. Recommended.</p>
