<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-833282c6-7fff-7802-e0c1-35679bc2208e"">City has always featured a plenitude of police. However, very few of these courageous pieces of plastic have gotten names. This set is an exception as it features a named cop that otherwise only appears in larger, more expensive sets.</b></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-833282c6-7fff-7802-e0c1-35679bc2208e"">Minifigures</b></h3>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-833282c6-7fff-7802-e0c1-35679bc2208e"">The named cop is in fact Duke Detain and he carries every bit of police stereotype with him. This works to excellent effect as you can see by his clean black pants and dark blue, skin tight shirt with a golden badge. The printed chest holster and belt only add depth to this stunning figure. To top it all off, he has classy 70s sunglasses and retro hair giving this character a sweet familiarity.</b></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-833282c6-7fff-7802-e0c1-35679bc2208e"">Much less could be said of his partner. She has an overly routine uniform and boring dual molded hair under hat piece. The printing on her face is not even worth talking about and I was rather disappointed by the whole figure.&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-833282c6-7fff-7802-e0c1-35679bc2208e"">Thankfully, the crooks have much better standards. Though both of them rely on older parts, the elements are combined to great effect. I can say I am glad to have obtained both of them.</b></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-833282c6-7fff-7802-e0c1-35679bc2208e"">The Completed Model</b></h3>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-833282c6-7fff-7802-e0c1-35679bc2208e"">The build in question is a bank wall safe. Although entirely straightforward, I like the end result. It is important to note that the City Bank sign is printed and will likely prove to be useful elsewhere. A handcart is graciously included and always adds to the environment.</b></p>

<h3 dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-833282c6-7fff-7802-e0c1-35679bc2208e"">Overall</b></h3>

<p dir=""ltr""><b id=""docs-internal-guid-833282c6-7fff-7802-e0c1-35679bc2208e"">I am satisfied with this set despite the relatively small size and lack of original pieces. The price could have been a little lower and the quality improved slightly, but I am sure that most City and/or Minifigure collectors will want to grab this set and make a speedy getaway.</b></p>
