This small set from the bionicle theme, is really small and combines some pieces characteristics from the theme, but in old style, like the technic sets from the last years of 1990's and first of 2000's, pieces like the heads, connections. The building is easy, two green pieces, in the same shape of the toa mata and nuva's heads, are used as feet in this set, like the other turaga from the same year. Two connections makes the small legs, don't moves well, but the color scheme still nice. The body is too simple, and it is black, like some other few details on it. The arms are more long, and the hands are simple, too, but these carry well the staff, a green staff with a buzzsaw on the top, well designed. The Turaga Matau's head is the same of the Toa Mata, and Matau includes a lime green original kanohi mahiki, basic but nice, in a cool style of the first bionicle sets. Overall, the playability and building is not the best of this set, but all the pieces are useful and the set have a nice design. Altough small, this is a good option to a bionicle fan, this was cheap, but now is a rarity, so, it is more expensive. Another bioicle that can be called a classic.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

First and foremost, the two things that stare you in the face: the mask and the buzzsaw. The mask, the Noble Mahiki, the noble Mask of Illusion, is quite nice, with good detailing. The buzzsaw is the kind of weapon you`de expect a Turaga to have: small, slightly powerful, but very weak compared to Toa weapons. It`s a good little weapon and adds to Matau`s jungly look.
Matau is a nice set. He matches his element well, and looks like the kind of wise leader you would like to have on your side. While he isn`t great, he is worthwhile.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
