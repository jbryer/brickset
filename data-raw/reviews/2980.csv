It could be used as a supply cart for any faction, with that great round shield.  Not anything too special as far as design goes, but the small chest clipping on works very well.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-03-30T11:46:59.957Z","Merchants make the world go round","This is one of the smaller sets that a peasant/merchant (6103's box is slightly bigger... other sets with non-soldiers include 6055, 1974 and 6040).  It is a fun set with a very nicely built chariot.  The chariot has a weird red thing with weapons attached to it, but it acts as a counterbalance to the front part of the chariot and thus keeps the chariot stable.

I used to use this set to supply my armoury (6041) from the blacksmith (6040) which was interesting since there's only so many times a castle can be sieged and battles can occur.  Trade and bargaining was more fun in my Castle universe than acts of violence on minifigs.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-08T15:49:57.31Z","Wagon","One great set and one of the oldest of castle. Of the Lion knights theme(one of the firsts with lion as symbol)and with great minifigures and details. This is a small set of the theme. Due to the size, i'm comparing with another small sets. Like these, this is a cool wagon, cart or chariot including a minifigure of a merchant and additions to knights. Spears and a shield in a circular shape are good to knights and many minifigures of castle, like archers and squires. The wagon is little, but connected with a horse makes a greater playability and keep this in feet because have two wheels. An axe is included, this is very small, but like the spears are useful. The colors aren't combined, but looks like with others wagons or carts, blue parts to connect the horse and black pieces to make the cart. The minifigure have a helm, don't a helmet, due to this be a merchant. The playability is basically use the horse to carry the wagon and makes the minifigures rides it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mike2008","2008-03-22T16:18:38.373Z","My first castle set","This was the first castle set I bought on my own. 
The set has plenty of advantages: wide weapon selection, minifig and a horse. When I was a child at that time, we used the supply wagon to help deliver weapons from the black smith to the castle. In addition, when we added an archer, the supply wagon becomes a war chariot. 

Hours of play and a lot of fun. 
When my daughter will be old enough, I am going to buy this set for her.

This one started it all for me,its just really cool. His round,grey shields were nice and nuetral so I could arm guys without them having to be Falcons or Lions. With an axe, a spear and a sword what more could you want?

"Freezdried","2010-01-28T11:21:08.513Z","Great little set","I remember buying this set when it first came out.  I was so excited about getting the peasant guy.  He was so unique! (for the time)  1984 was a landmark year for Lego castle.  Before this time, castle sets used pieces re-purposed from town sets and looked out-of-place (think of the knight's procession set with the cart that had rubber tires!)  With the sets like this one, Castle finally came to its own.  Real horses, real wooden wheels, real horse hitches, and of course the castle walls!  But of all the Castle sets I got that year, this was the one I was most excited about.

Now that I look back though, some things stand out as kind of weird.  The red assembly that attaches to the back of the cart is bizarre.  I can't think of any real-life equivalent.  I guess it's supposed to be a chest or something, loaded with supplies.  But I've never seen one that attaches to the back of a cart like that.  Oh well, it's still a nice little set, with great character.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-12T19:54:18.32Z","Supply Wagon Review","<p>I actually got this as a ""bonus"" when winning on another bid. I knew the set&nbsp;I was bidding&nbsp;on was incomplete and I'd be using it for spare parts. I just hadn't realized the seller would be including other pieces for other sets not related to what I won.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And in that box when it came, was the original instructions and most of this set. I haven't put it all together, so I'm not sure how complete it is. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But just having one of the older classic Castle sets featuring the Uncommon or Rare Peasant figure is great. He's got a wide selection of weapons that he's carrying in his wagon, and as it was bonus, I've probably got far more then what his wagon was meant to hold. There's a white horse that's fairly standard and the wagon is decent enough.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"Ernst","2016-04-19T21:38:56.497Z","Supply Wagon, the proof that less is more .....","<p><font face=""Courier New""><strong>Overall 5 bricks :</strong> Oh, how I love old small sets like this. This is another example from the great <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/theme-Castle/subtheme-Lion-Knights"">Lion Knights subtheme </a>that shows how much you can do with 35 most small Lego pieces. Lego would make a lot of people happy if they would restart a Castle line with sets like this. I would buy sets like this in a hurry, the last set I remember that comes close to this is set <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/7949-1/Prison-Carriage-Rescue"">7949 : Prison Carriage Rescue</a>. But if I had to choose I would take this one, simply because although it has just 1 mini figure&nbsp;it has more possibilities in my opinion.</font></p>

<p><strong>Building 4 bricks </strong>: Not too&nbsp;difficult of course but the fun is the fact that with the assembling of some 19 small plates, a turn table,&nbsp;2 wheels and&nbsp;1 slope you just created&nbsp;a great looking functional small cart with a luggage box.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 4 bricks :</strong> Nothing very special but all useful parts including 7 fragile modified 1x1 plates. Great weapons and accessories with as price the <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?P=3876&amp;idColor=10#T=P&amp;C=10"">rare round shield without heraldry</a>. And of course the great <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?M=cas092#T=P"">civilian mini figure</a> !!</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks :</strong> The single set does not offers much fun of course but it was meant to add it to your other Castle sets and then it is multi functional. You can even use it still with modern day Castle sets, even with the 2013 Castle wave.</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks :</strong> The 1984 retail price was I think some &euro; 3,00 and the 2016 average used&nbsp;price on <a href=""http://alpha.bricklink.com/pages/clone/catalogitem.page?S=6010-1#T=P"">Bricklink</a> shows some &euro;10,00 which is not bad I think for a 32 year old set.</p>

"T79","2018-06-12T13:58:52.567Z","A Castle set without a knight?","<p>I&#39;m not sure if I received this set before or after I&#39;d gotten #6080 King&#39;s Castle (also known as Kasteel Klauwaert in my old catalogues, if I remember correctly), but I do know I was immensely disappointed when I found out that this cart couldn&#39;t pass through the castle gate (see why in the reviews over there). This childhood trauma notwithstanding (poetic exagerration ;-) the Supply Wagon was one of my favourite little castle sets back then.</p>

<p>The biggest reason why this particular set was such a favourite was the minifigure, our first - and, until I got #6055 Prisoner Convoy, our only - medieval minifigure with plain clothes. It&#39;s just a simple print but that pouch was such a wonderful addition, it made the figure come alive for me. The same shirt design was later reused for a Forestmen figure so you just know it had to be good. A brilliant cowl piece completed our peasant/trader/outlaw, another part I just loved even though it was rather fragile - just like those early helmets used by the classic spacemen. Another reason is all the equipment he comes with: a sword, a spear, an axe, a hammer (again, I think our first and I loved it as well) and that round shield (first, loved it, you know it by now). A horse with hitch and those lovely cart wheels (first, etc.) round out the part selection, what remains are mostly 1 x 1 plates with clip (seriously, one fifth of the 35 parts are these).</p>

<p>The minifigure and shield lacked any sigil or other mark of affiliation - there&#39;s not even a flag on the wagon - so this set could be used as a neutral trader or attached to whichever faction you thought needed a boost. This does make its inclusion in the Lion Knights subtheme a tad random, there should have been more of these &#39;neutral&#39; sets as a different subtheme is what I always thought.</p>

<p>Aside from the difficult relation with castle gates there were other small frustrations: the brick-built chest certainly looked the part (if attached to the cart in a strange way) but I always felt it to be a shame you couldn&#39;t actually use it to store anything, more importantly however this made the cart heavier in the back. Once those hinges on the hitch and turntable wore out the wagon kept tipping backwards at the slightest nudge.</p>

<p>This set was literally played to pieces, and I don&#39;t mean that in the way Lego is supposed to come apart: the turntable with hinge, one of those plates with pin to connect the wheels, the cowl, the shield... they all broke somewhere. So I&#39;ve had to bricklink quite a lot of pieces to get this small set back the way it&#39;s supposed to be but I don&#39;t regret that in the slightest!</p>

"Niki124","2023-02-19T19:01:44.937Z","Great introduction to the Castle theme","<p>This was our first Castle-themed Lego set, and a good introduction, with a variety of mediaeval weapons and a then-new moulded horse. The characterisation of the minifigure is very good, and overall it left us wanting more of the Castle sets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set isn&#39;t a large or complicated build, but there are several fiddly parts and it&#39;s not clear in the early stages how everything will come together. But Lego have designed this in a clever way, and it does come together, and means there&#39;s versatility there to build alternatives with.&nbsp;</p>
