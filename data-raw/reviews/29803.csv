<p>The Chinese Dragon monthly mini model build is very very detail and includes a lot of nice pieces for its size .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>Starting with the head it is very nicely sloped and the oversized teeth , printed eyes and big&nbsp;nostrils are to its cartoonieness . Each segment of the body is declared by 1&times;1 corner tiles in white or yellow .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a great parts pack and actual build is great only down all is how bland the tail looks but overall I would recommend this set</p>
