"Novelty","2007-04-03T07:26:56.33Z","Not another parts set","At first look this might seem to be another parts set.  There's the horse, the minifig and the treasure chest.  Boring.  Or so it seems.  Look under the hood, or the chariot in this case, and things look a bit more bright.  For starters, the chariot is well balanced and it's small and light and ideal for chariot races.  And there's space on the chariot for the treasure chest AND the soldier.  The colour scheme is nicely done, adding yellow to the basic red/black scheme of the time making it look rather appealing.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"hustla187","2008-11-12T19:56:20.513Z","Better than Most Would Say","This is a fantastic set that has some great pieces like a grey chest and a yellow saddle. The red and yellow cart is nice, but should be used for carrying the king. The minifig also has a spear and a helmet. Most people would say this is OK, but this set is way better than OK!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-08T14:40:59.25Z","A small set deserves a rate in comparision with one","This is a small set of the black falcons theme. It is an old theme, but some pieces still useful and other turned in rare pieces. This set receive the Black knight name, but the black knights were other theme. The set consists in a knight with a horse and a little cart with a treasure chest. The chest piece is well made, here can be putted many different shapes of pieces, or also little plates. The minifigure have the simple design of an original lego castle set, with good colors. A black horse is an addition to the minifigure, and in this without the minifigure can be putted the cart, with the yellow parts on it's fronts to make a little chariot. It have few pieces because is small, but these are cool in colors and altough simple are useful to many sets, a thing in consideration to smaller sets. This is a small set, due to it this don't have many pieces and isn't expensive. Is hard to find now, but is a great option if you are searching for old castle minifigures and little carts.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-01-09T03:58:59.477Z","Treasured Cart","Black armour isn't free and The Black Knight no doubt had to fund operations with a coffer of plundered taxes.

The shafts can sit over (in) the horse and the guard can sit on the back with the spare saddle, pointing the spear at all who want to 'have a go'. The horse colour made a simple difference to small sets, in this case the set appearing more ominous and oppressive in line with the dark theme of the black falcons, not necessarily the bad guys until Robin Hood turned up and they just looked right for King John and the Sheriff of Nottingham's men.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Tax Trax</b>&nbsp;</div><div>The small carts are worth getting a couple of to bulk out action but otherwise this one remains a small icon of the cheerful 1980s castle theme.</div></div>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,4
"Ernst","2011-06-16T18:07:54.327Z","Nice additional set","<p>Nice small set which can be used with almost all older Castle sets, although it is really a Black Falcon Knight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not a big building experience because it's a small set, so just 3 bricks here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts are nice, good details are both the yellow saddle as well as the cart connection and the rare grey treasure box. Missing in my view are a shield and a sword, I added those myself from spare parts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The playability of this set is high because you can use it with almost all Castle sets, good thinking of Lego !</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set has probably turned into a collectors item over the years, otherwise I can't explain the average price of â‚¬ 15,00 on Bricklink. I was lucky to receive it as a (surprise) free extra in a Castle I bought. Better is to compose it yourself from extra parts you may own, although I think the obstacle will be the grey treasure chest. Still I'm happy to own it, basicly it's a very nice set.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,5,4
