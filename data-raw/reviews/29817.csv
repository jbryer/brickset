<p>This set was a &#39;gift with purchase&#39; when you bought for &euro;75,&nbsp;during the grand opening event of the LEGO flagship store Amsterdam.&nbsp;<br />
It&#39;s a typical 15-20 euro set (127&nbsp;pieces), without any exclusive parts.&nbsp;<br />
The build is nice, but nothing special. If you want to build it, the instructions can probably be found online (or ask :) )</p>

<p>I see this set for crazy prices online (&euro;75 and up), and unless you are a die hard LEGO&nbsp;collector with enough money to spend. This set is not worth that kind of money.&nbsp;</p>
