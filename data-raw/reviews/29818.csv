"Minifig290","2019-12-01T21:13:20.033Z","Neat Little Promotional Product","<p>Hello all today i will be taking a short look at the LEGO Promotional 5006066 Brick Friday 2019 Brick that was given out at LEGO Brand Stores during the Black Friday weekend with all in store purchases over &pound;55.</p>

<p><strong>Brick</strong></p>

<p>The brick is just a black 2x4 brick with a nice golden print saying &quot;BRICK FRIDAY 2019&quot;, this will go perfectly with the Brick Friday Minifigure that was given out at LEGO Shop with purchases over &pound;75 on Cyber Monday 2019.</p>

<p><strong>Packageing</strong></p>

<p>This package is just a simple plastic blister pack used for Comic Con and Grand Store opening figures, the cardboard backing has the theming of the 2019 Black Friday on it with a black tag saying &quot;2019 BLACK FRIDAY&quot;, also strange to mention its a 4+ set though i doubt any child under 10 will manage to get this unless there quite lucky</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>A great little freebie though according to the recipt this if it was to be sold would be &pound;3.99 which would be a bit of a silly price for a single brick. If anyone is planning on getting the Brick Friday figure this would go perfectly with it.</p>

<p>Right now the eBay prices of this single little brick are sort of ridicoulus, the cheapest buy it now price i could see as of writing was just short of &pound;18. So this little freebie is a good investment for those who want to make some money back of their purchase</p>

<p>Pros - Great little cremaritive promotion</p>

<p>Cons - Resellers selling this at a fortune making it unappealing for anyone wanting it who missed it</p>
