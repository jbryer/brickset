"Novelty","2007-04-03T09:17:23.79Z","Ballista","The people who named this set probably don't know the difference between a Ballista and a Oxybeles.  This seems like a Basllista on a handcart.

The good is that this set contains three arrows and 2 minifigs.  The set is also nicely designed and it actually looks like an oversized crossbow on a card.  The bad is that there's a barrel thing on which the oversize crossbow sits which could function as almost anything.  Still, thanks to the fact that it's hidden away, it is easy to dismiss.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"brickzone","2007-05-06T10:23:20.843Z","Making a point","This is a nice little set that provides yet another little siege device for any battles etc. between the knight factions. It's not clear how the mechanism would work, but the spears get the point across that this isn't a friendly device. The overall construction looks quite neat; nice how the knights can pick it up and wheel it along, and the two spears on the sides stabalise it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-08T16:01:49.92Z","Cart with spears","This set is from the lion knights, but aren't all minifigure that have this as symbol. This is a small set, like the another lots of carts, wagons and chariots of castle or the rafts of pirates. This is cool too, altough little, have useful pieces. A minifigure have a different helmet in comparision with the other knight. One have a longbow and a piece made to like bows on his back. The other in the image is only carrying the cart, but also without the minifigure the cart can keeps in feet. It is due to two spears with additional pieces under these. Another spear is above the cart, and it looks like with an arrow of ballista, but isn't. Black pieces are useful, like some in the shape of ramp under the spear part. The wheels are the same old, staying in front of the spears, this can be played easily. The playability, like the building, is basic, due to the contents. This consists in makes the minifigures rides the cart, with spears on it to beats in buildings or other carts. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

Finally, someone gave them armoured legs! This looks great.<div><br></div><b>Lock &amp; Load</b></div><div>Another small Castle set, this set needs an axle plate and long plate to put the main body on. Three slants build each side on the four stud wide axle and hold an two stud plate offset and a headlight brick, all very black this model. In front of two clips the yellow 'barrel' is placed, built in five parts.. A nice feature, it should be a wooden item and like black, does fine despite the lack of brown bricks. Maybe it is a weight or is meant to store tar for flaming bodkins? A twin exhaust/ handle is put on the long plate for pushing the cart around.</div><div><br></div><div>In fact this siege cart is a multi plate build. Many black plates stack around two spaced apart headlight bricks. On top is an offset stud black plate holding a clutcher/clip plate. This whole section has to be tilted forward so its all actually a nice bit of SNOT technique.</div><div><br></div><div>It clips on to the top of two slanted bricks of the main body which comprises of those several slants stacked around a centrally offset lion shield which looks wonderful and makes a defensive front. The clips hold brown spears with white cones maybe for feathering or weights or a safety block or something more explosive? Either way they make fantastic stabilisers. One spear can sit on top ready to 'fire' but sorry no launch action here apart from unclipping and using your own sound effects.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Spear Mint</b></div><div>You may find these reasonably common on ebay to pick up, should you wish. As small carts go, its not horse drawn or outstanding but it is very original and with the light grey armoured legs makes a refreshing and very worthwhile set. A shame the Lion Knights missed out on more black and greys for armour here and there but you can't knock the smart red and blue.&nbsp;</div></div>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,3
