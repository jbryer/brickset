<p>Mister Miracle is really a stand-out figure among the DC Collectible Minifigure Super Heroes range. The green, yellow, and red colors combine to create an eye-catching design. But who is this masked miracle man and is he worth the new $4.99 price?</p>

<h3>Who is he?</h3>

<p>Mister Miracle (Scott Free) is an immortal superhero with the powers of superhuman strength, agility, speed, coordination, reflexes, and stamina. But his most outstanding ability is to be able to escape from any situation, even to a higher degree than Batman can.</p>

<p>Since this is more of an obscure DC character, I found this excellent video that will explain Mister Miracle&#39;s history much better than I can: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nx-hhDFb6K4"">History of Mister Miracle</a>.</p>

<p>Now that you know who he is, does his minifigure represent him well enough? Let&#39;s find out!</p>

<h3>Review</h3>

<p>Mister Miracle has a red head with an intricate yellow mask. His slight grin and raised eyebrows gives him a confident yet friendly look.</p>

<p>Behind his head is a nice green cloak that compliments his red and yellow head.</p>

<p>His torso starts with a golden yellow cloak clasp, which also has some small green cloak details that make it look like his green cape is actually connected to his body. The yellow stripe in the middle of his torso looks like a miniature Sun, with radiating zigzag lines of yellow and bright yellow. Below that is a red belt with two golden circles that wraps around the abdomen area.</p>

<p>Even with the green cape, the back of the torso is surprisingly printed, with black lines that represent his shoulder blades, more of that intricate yellow and bright yellow detailing in the middle of his torso, and also the red belt that has four more golden circles.</p>

<p>The arms are luckily dual-moulded red and yellow and the hands are green. It should be noted that the arms have no printing, but I don&#39;t believe it is important to represent this minifigure.</p>

<p>The legs are very detailed and are also dual-moulded, with the legs being red and green. The dual-mould is complemented nicely with yellow and black lines to outline his green boots and some extra green print on the sides of the legs as well.</p>

<p>Mister Miracle also comes with a light bluish gray chain, which can be wrapped around him as a simple challenge to his skills as an escape artist. He also comes with two pairs of handcuffs to further the challenge.</p>

<p>And as with all the figures in the DC Minifigs line, he includes a black 1x2 jumper plate, a 3x4 black tile minifigure stand, and a new piece: a trans-clear posing stand, which you can use to make him look like he&#39;s floating above the ground and pose him in many fun ways.</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>Overall, this is one of my favorite minifigures of all time. Even though he&#39;s not that well known, the colors and details alone makes me super interested in who Mister Miracle really is. In my opinion, he is the best minifigure in the DC Collectible Minifigure line, so of course I will say the price of $5 is definitely worth the&nbsp;purchase. I hope you found this review helpful, and thank you for reading!</p>

<p>Mister Miracle is an unknown to me. I have no ideas about his backstory or anything else, but I find him to be exceptionally intriguing. His Minifigure wears two separate cape elements, one long cape and a shorter upper brim section both in green. He comes with chains and handcuffs for accessories. Mister Miracle seems to be part illusionist or something as he tries his hand at escaping certain doom effortlessly. His printing is on his torso, legs and back. He features some very nice detailing and dual-moulded arms and legs.</p>

<p>Introduced with the DC Series is a new element, a 1x1 stud with half-bar attached which allows you to simulate flight or perform other interesting build ideas. This new element is highly versatile and with enough of them you can achieve a lot of great things. Mister Miracle only includes one, most others have an extra in the set, but Mister Miracle did not. Overall. Highly Recommended.</p>

"Bowtie_Bricks","2022-10-10T14:11:12.89Z","A Miracle of a Figure","<p>Mister Miracle is a figure that never seemed like we would get in Lego; DC&#39;s &quot;New Gods&quot; have never stood out, until Tom King&#39;s run of Mister Miracle. This figure is a shining representation of that classic comic appearance.</p>

<p>The inclusion of dual moulded legs and arms is spectacular. The plain red and yellow arms specifically are especially useful for customs, including a fellow DC hero Adam Strange! The legs are also dual moulded, but the printing takes away some of its use.</p>

<p>The torso and head are spot on. Intricate detailing of his yellow and red accents compliment one another perfectly. Sadly, this detail is covered by his shackles for him to escape from. I believe that giving him some of his areo-discs would be welcome as well, but I respect the choice for simplicity of accessories.</p>

<p>His 2 cape pieces are spot on as well, which may come in handy if you want to make an Allan&nbsp;Scott Green Lantern!</p>

<p>Overall this is a standout figure of the series, and includes useful pieces to make even more DC customs!</p>

<p>I am kind of lost for words with this one. Stunning, perfection, splendid, ingenious, amazing, unreal, ... I simply cannot find enough positive things to say about this character.</p>

<p>It&#39;s,...WOW!</p>

<p>The colours, the printing, the accuracy to the source material, the facial expression, his attributes, it is all so perfect!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I first saw the release of these DC figures, this was the one figure I absolutely wanted to get. It looked so cool, so damn cool. The double cape, the abundance of colours, the red-yellow and green colour scheme, the handcuffs and shackles...oh man!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The prints are so good!&nbsp;At first sight it might seem&nbsp;like a mess, but when you take a closer look, you start to see the fine detailing: subtle lines around the green leg and hip printing, touches of light-yellow to add depth on the belt and clips that hold his cape, additional lining around his eyes to create his nostalgic facial expression...&nbsp;WOW!</p>

<p>On a side note: strange thing I noticed: his cape feels way more stiff than superman&#39;s.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway: this is the one to get! It is mister miracle&#39;s miraculous perfection!!</p>
