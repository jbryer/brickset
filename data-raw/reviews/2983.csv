"A_Brickset_user","2003-06-13T00:00:00Z","","There will be more daimyo (samurai lords) than samurai knights. I only bought this to be a completionist of the original six Ninja sets that were in the mini-catalog that comes in some sets' boxes. My solution to that problem (Okay so I didn't actually have MORE daimyo than samurai, but it was close) was to give some of that armor from these guys to the European knights, and make these normal warriors. There wasn't enough armor for all the samurai of course, so I only have it for a selected few. Good for another horse.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-07-16T06:02:50.623Z","Shogun","This is the smallest of the Ninja sets and it features what seems to be a king/shogun on a horse.  There's not much design in this, but it seems to have been thoughtfully put together with the blue saddle on the black horse matching the blue flag.  The golden antlers on the helmet gives the shogun an interesting touch, and it can be removed as well to make the soldier just a plain calvary grunt.  The lance and the katana seems to be there for fun.  This set is great to build a huge army, or even a courier service, but it's also fun to play with on its own with a bit of imagination.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2008-04-28T13:40:55.187Z","A complete samurai warrior","This is my only ninja set. It is small but I'm sure it is a good addition to your collection if you have other sets from the ninja series. You get a black horse including a black 1x2 brick and a black 1x2 plate. With these you can fill the whole in the horses back when you remove the saddle. I think all sets with horses came with extra bricks and plates for saddle removals. The saddle itself has two clips. So you can attach the sword and the lance with the flag to the saddle. 

There's a samurai robe printed on the minifig's torso. The hip of the legs is blue. The legs without the hip are black with an armor pattern printed on the upper third. The sword is in old light gray and the armor plus the helmet in old dark grey. On the helmet you can put a chrome gold piece. The helmet would look very bare without it. The flag is quite big but the lance is long enough for it.

"Gus_263","2008-03-27T16:13:52.2Z","Samurai in the ninja themes","Make a samurai to the ninja themes is a great idea, to make different armies, and with the flag of this, too the horse, is easy to see the differences of one to other. This includes a spear of joust with the blue flag, and the minifigure carries a katana, liking with the armors, and helmet, in this, with a golden piece. The horse is black, and the black ones were very released in the old castle themes. Blue details in the minifigure, in the flag and with the horse, make a good color scheme. It is small, but compatible with many sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-12T20:10:34.167Z","Samurai Review","<p>A set this size is, while in the price range of an impluse buy, it also serves as an army builder for the Castle Oriental theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I loved that Lego (at the time) had finally done an Oriental them and Ninjas, there weren't very many of the sets that I wanted to get. Ninja are cool and all, but I also love the Samurai and this is/was a way to get a samurai in an inexpensive manner, plus as already stated, build up an army.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get a Samurai decked out in armor and weapons and a horse with blue saddle and blue flag on a lance. The face on this minifigure does look a bit older, but taking in mind the gold ""antlers"" of the helmet, he looks more like he's a Daimyo, then a regular samurai. Despite that, he is very cool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And while I'd bought one for myself, later that year when Christmas came, I'd gotten a second one as a stocking stuffer from Santa.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T15:56:29.973Z","The Last Samurai","<p>Set #6013 Samurai Swordsman: Continuing with my reviews I will now take a moment to discuss this impulse style set from the Lego Ninja Theme of the late 90's. There isn't much to say about this set as far as construction goes, but this isn't for building, this is for Troop Building (lol).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get a horse, one mini-figure, ninja style katana, samura armor, samurai helmet, a special Ninja theme flag. The Samurai's helmet also has a gold topper piece and when bought Mint in Sealed Box (MISB) this set came with an extra gold topper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All in all this is a nice little addition to any Ninja collection, the more the merrier, plus it's a cheap way to get an army of Samurai. Or it was back in the day, I'm not sure how much increase in value it's had for the secondary market. It's hard to judge that I suppose. I recomend this to any fans of Castle Ninja or Castle in general, the Samurai makes an excellent specialty soldier for your king/queen.</p>",TRUE,4,3,1,5,4
