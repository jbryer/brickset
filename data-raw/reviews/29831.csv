"PerryThePlatypus","2020-02-05T14:40:18.36Z","In the Awesomeness of This figure, I Believe","<p>This is a pretty amazingly detailed minifigure from top to bottom.&nbsp;From the torso , to the legs, and the dress! It&#39;s easily my favorite version of Wonder Woman that Lego made.</p>

<p>Anyway let&#39;s start off with the legs. The boot printing is phenomenal! It&#39;s a dual molded&nbsp;legs design that has a high level of detail with lots of color&nbsp;all over it , with red ,&nbsp;white, flesh coloring, and the blue with the stars on it under the dress, I especially like how the white layer of the boots&nbsp;are carried on from the front to&nbsp;the side of the legs. The dress has white stars all around it, and even if you remove the dress piece,&nbsp;the figure will still look&nbsp;pretty complete&nbsp;, which is a great detail. The torso comes with the eagle printing on the front and bracelets on the arms (which is something you don&#39;t&nbsp;see very often on a Wonder Woman figure so it&#39;s a very welcome&nbsp;detail) ,&nbsp;and the back torso printing is also great with the continuation of her outfit. Her new expressions are also really good&nbsp;with a content and angry expression which could easily&nbsp;be used for custom figures and still very fitting for the character. A downside to this figure, I would say (but not necessarily bad that would make this figure worse)&nbsp;would be the hair/tiara combo. It&#39;s an existing piece ,and maybe it could have used a new mold&nbsp;for more accuracy of her first appearance , but it&#39;s still not a bad inclusion. The lasso is a nice cheap way to get the piece within this figure, and it&#39;s a very fitting accessory (despite not being the more unique accessory of the series).</p>

<p>It&#39;s incredibly detailed, and it seems pretty accurate to the first appearance of the character. This was easily one of my favorites of the DC minifigures&nbsp;and is easily recommendable for Lego and Super Hero fans!</p>

With the golden eagle breastplate and the blue stars motif under skirt, this Minifigure captures Wonder Woman in all her glory.</p>

<p>She includes the hard plastic LEGO skirt piece printed with stars to match the overall look and features dual-moulded legs with side printing for the skin tone. Her silver bracers are printed on the sides of her arm and her trusty Lasso of Truth is included. Her hair piece is a familiar one, and she features two expressions. Smiling and Angry/Ready for Battle.</p>

<p>Coming with two of the new element Wonder Woman can simulate flight or dynamic action poses. Overall a decent offering from the DC Super Heroes Theme and highly collectible. If you&#39;re interested in Wonder Woman variants this is a must own CMF. Strongly Recommended.</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2021-10-26T11:56:03.9Z","Good Minifigure, Right Character, Right Variation!","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>Wonder Woman is a DC Comics icon and a member of its trinity of main characters. This automatically makes her fit to reside in a DC Super Heroes CMF series, and her included variant is 100% based on the correct source material.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The hair crown combo is the same black mould from 2012 but with yellow printing for a classic look, the head has a smirking and aggressive facial expression on either side, the torso features a large eagle print for her patriotic original attire, she has printed silver wristbands on her arms, a skirt that features stars printed on the blue background and dual moulded legs with front and side printing.</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>The one accessory is her golden &#39;Lasso of Truth&#39; which is plain but acceptable. The stand is the standard black CMF stand with a 1&times;2 black jumper and the action pose piece for extra display options.</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This is a fantastic Minifigure that I think LEGO should be proud of, the detail is simplistic and intricate at the same time and the pieces could be used out of the character, so overall I recommend this figure to Wonder Woman and DC fans alike.</p>
