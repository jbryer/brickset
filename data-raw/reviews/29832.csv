Ruler of the Sea.","<p><b>Set #71026 Aquaman:</b>&nbsp;Representing the ruler of Atlantis from the 90s, this version captures the intense insanity of that era quite nicely. Featuring some excellent print detailing for his shoulder armour, including side-arm printing on the one silver arm he has to represent the silver sleeve he wore.</p>

<p>I used to actually own a version of this figure in action figure form, before I sold off my DC Action Figures and parted with most of them. This guy looks pretty close to that figure, with all the appropriate details, including the scale design on his legs. He also has a new hand attachment for his pearl gold hook hand. This is because at one point Aquaman cut off his own hand to save his son, truly it was an epic time of EXTREME! Action. He includes a smiling bearded facial print and an angry bearded expression, carries a lime-green fish for some reason instead of his trident and has long flowing blonde hair.</p>

<p>Overall this is an impressive recreation of a truly epic version of Aquaman. He is Highly Recommended.</p>

The son nobody wanted, the friend nobody cared about. And to be honest, it wasn&#39;t even your fault. You had a bad start to begin with, &quot;Super Friends&quot; made it worse, and &quot;Justice League&quot; sealed the deal.</p>

<p>Shame really...</p>

<p>With this figure we get the 1994 version of Aquaman, and I must say, he is really accurate to the source material. His chest resembles some nice printing with strapped armour going all the way into his right arm, which has a metallic silver colour with nice printing to resemble scales.<br />
The hook for a hand is also accurate, but I would rather have had the standard hook piece, since this specialised mould is completely useless. It also looks way too big.</p>

<p>(note that it also doesn&#39;t shine like in the promotional pictures. It is way less glossy).</p>

<p>As attributes, we get a yellowish-green fish. Strange choice. I&nbsp;like to think it is an inside LEGO joke, because, seriously, Aquaman is a bit of a wet fish.<br />
Swap it out for a trident, I did. It brings some much-needed street credibility to the figure. You all know that it is what Aquaman needs!</p>

"Bowtie_Bricks","2022-10-20T13:53:54.03Z","The 90s Surfaced!","<p>The 1990s was a period when comics took a darker turn, and Aquaman was not an exception. This depiction of him is a drastic change from the bright orange and green that LEGO has normally produced. Thus, this figure is a great addition to the series, as it is a costume that many never thought we would get.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The hair and head are the same as the Aquaman from #76116 set. However, they do accurately represent the comic, so it seems fitting. Personally, I would have liked a more rugged and angry expression, but that wouldn&#39;t fit in with the rest of the series, so I understand the choice on LEGO&#39;s end.</p>

<p>His torso is a standout piece. The arm-plate he wears contains printing to give it a slight silver shine, as well as some textured lines. The new hook hand on his opposite hand is a new piece that can work for various customs, too. The fishnet pattern on his dual moulded legs continues up to a small part on the torso, lining up surprisingly well for a CMF figure. These fishnet prints are another amazing piece, which are useful for a variety of other customs and ocean-related figures.</p>

<p>The fish accessory is lame. There&#39;s no getting around that. A new trident mould would have been a much nicer and fitting accessory, however the prints of the figure outweigh the lousy accessory, and I think that this is a figure for any superhero collector!</p>
