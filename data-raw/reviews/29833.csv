I guess this character is slightly more to the obscure side of character selections of the series, but that didn&#39;t stop me from getting for the great&nbsp;accessory and printing of the figure which makes it one of the stronger figures of the series IMHO.</p>

<p>The legs are highly detailed with a dual-molded design of blue&nbsp;and black as the boots. The white lines are carried on from the front to the side with a little bit of flesh as well , which is really great detailing for the side of the leg. The torso has a printed red utility belt , instead of the&nbsp;utility belt piece, that is also printed on the back. The big signature star for her symbol&nbsp;is on the front and great arm printing with 3 stars on each arm. Both of her face prints have her blue mask on, one with a confident&nbsp;smile, and the other with an open smile that shows her braces which has a silver shine to it that I really appreciate. The coloring for her hair isn&#39;t new , it came before with the Black Canary figure from the The Lego Batman Movie Series 2 , but it&#39;s still a useful hair piece and it was nice to get. The new mold introduced with this figure is the top piece for her staff that has a curve to it to make it look accurate to the comics. In terms of usability , I don&#39;t think the piece is that useful for different situations , but it was still a welcome new piece and with an interesting translucent orange and glitter/sparkle to it. It&#39;s attached to a staff piece with a useful coloring&nbsp;that came in pearl gold. And as all other figures of the DC series , she comes with the pieces to pose the figures in any way you want.</p>

<p>Overall, I like this figure for the great amount of detailing on the arms and the side of the leg,&nbsp;cool face prints, hair and accessory. Definitely one of the more obscure character of the series, but also better ones. It definitely deserves my recommendation, just not as strong as Huntress, Batman , or Wonder Woman of the same series.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-16T17:08:35.137Z","Legacy Heroine.","<p><b>Set #71026 Stargirl:&nbsp;</b>LEGO&#39;s DC Series 1 (hopefully soon to include Series 2) introduces many variants of existing characters alongside some rather obscure heroes. Stargirl is one of them, I have no idea as to her power or backstory, but I dig her look.</p>

<p>Dressed in a costume with star detailing on her arms for some nice side-printing, this character includes some smiling expressions, two different types of smiles on either face, a mask included on both sides and dual-moulded legs with some printing. She has a printed utility belt that resembles the bat family and carries an interesting looking staff into battle. The source of her powers from what little I know.</p>

<p>Overall, Stargirl is an impressive offering from the DC universe and certainly worth tracking down for fans of the character or fans of female super heroes. Highly Recommended.</p>

"BelgianBricker","2021-07-17T12:57:25.11Z","Not the star of the DC-show","<p>I&#39;m not the biggest DC-fan (I like Marvel better, they are somewhat out of the box, while DC is rather conservative), but when I saw these figs at discount at my local store, I thought, why not pick some up.</p>

<p>Star Girl was the 8 figure to pop up from the 10 blind bags I bought.</p>

<p>I have to admit I had no idea who she was, but after doing some research I noticed that the LEGO rendition of this character is quite accurate to the one from the comic books. The spandex shorts with the white lining, the cropped top, the giant star, and the 3 stars on&nbsp;her arms, they are all quite accurate.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they did a really good job with her staff, and I am glad to see they made a specialised piece for the tip. The glitter-orange looks spectacular. Using a simple&nbsp;gold bar for the handle also seems like a good compromise at this scale.</p>

<p>Then why am I not in love with this figure? Well, there are some things that bother me. Most notably, the torso printing. Because they had to print white and flesh on blue, these colours are not crisp. This is particularly noticeable on&nbsp;her belly-print. This colour is way off and looks more like white. It really is a shame, because getting the colours right is very important for the overall look of this character and for 5&euro; a figure, I expect better, much better!<br />
Also, I feel like this figure could have benefited from a real utility belt-piece rather than a red printed one. It would have brought in some dimension and volume.</p>

<p>In conclusion: is this a bad figure. No, not at all. She may be a Star Girl;&nbsp;she is definitely&nbsp;not the star of the DC-show.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stargirl is a DC character with a profile that has remained decently popular over the years, prior to this collectible Minifigure series, LEGO had never produced a rendition of her, however here she is, in her Captain America-looking glory.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>She has a&nbsp;generic hair piece in sand yellow which works fine, her face features braces and a mask accompanied by a smirking and grinning facial expression, her torso is also great with her printed arms adding to the appeal, and her legs are dual moulded with some great side leg printing.</p>

<p>The Accessory-&nbsp;</p>

<p>Her single&nbsp;accessory is her Cosmic Staff with a pearl gold 1x4 bar and a special moulded piece on the&nbsp;top in transparent orange with glitter infused for the Staff&#39;s signature hook-shape.&nbsp;The stand is the standard black CMF stand with a 1x2 black jumper with an action pose piece for more display options.</p>

<p>In Conclusion-</p>

<p>This&nbsp;is a very well-made Minifigure, her printing is great, and her accessory is interesting, I don&#39;t see any area for improvement other than the obvious overcharge of CMF pricing, so I confidently recommend her to anyone interested.&nbsp;</p>
