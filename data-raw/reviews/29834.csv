Notably the Yellow Lantern Ring printed tile and Yellow Lantern accessory piece.</p>

<p>Before Sinestro wore yellow every day he had this original costume. Dressed in black with blue highlights, Sinestro travelled the cosmos seeking a means of combating the Green Lantern Corps after he was discharged. He found the Yellow Lantern and used it, along with a Yellow power ring, to spread fear and misery across the cosmos. Everything about Sinestro is new, his print, his facial expressions, his accessories, but this is a variant of the character and not a new character. Hopefully if they make a Series 2 we&#39;ll start to see other Lantern Corps members.</p>

<p>Highly Recommended. This figure looks great, the accessories are perfect and he&#39;s a must have for fans of the character.</p>

<p>If any version of Sinestro should have been made for the collectible minifigure series this should have been the one: old-school and classic.</p>

<p>Everything is right with this one: the costume matches the comic-book character perfectly, with some simple but effective arm and legprinting; a silver belt runs around his waste and hard to notice dark blue (?) lines define muscles on his front and back.</p>

<p>A marvellous yellow lantern en ring-piece create the finishing touch. Splendid. I would love to see more lantern factions being released, but it is most likely we will not see them represented...</p>

<p>Just one thought: this character is sleek, slim and slender. LEGO has made tall legs (Toy Story).<br />
For some characters, it would mean a world of difference. Just imagine how much better Sinestro would have looked...a missed opportunity.</p>
