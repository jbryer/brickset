"Sideswipe2","2020-11-10T09:45:34.423Z","Banded together... straight from Saturday mornings","<p>As an adult collector/builder that just recently got back into LEGO due to the situation, I was happy with adding more figures to my growing collection which the CMFs provided. This one, however, brought back a slew of memories from watching Saturday morning cartoons as a child.</p>

<p>The Minifigure is so printed, that it almost left me gasping for breath as I took in all the details of it... back printing, leg printing, SIDE of leg printing, arm printing, helmet printing, and even tail printing, along with the dual expression head, and the only part of the figure not seeing some print seems to be the hands. Wow. A lot of printing. I had to pull out my Challenge of the Super Friends DVDS and look at it, and even if this is from the comics instead, it is still a darn good representation of the Cheetah from the Legion of Doom.</p>

<p>The build itself was nice, with the tail added to the figure and the helmet with ears. The standard stand was nicely added to in this series with the 1X2 jumper plate and &quot;handle&quot; element allowing for more posibility for displaying it, like the others of the series (I personally use it mostly for flying characters). The money bag with the printed &quot;$&quot; sign takes me back to the cartoon days as well, as that was so typical of the old cartoons and comics to show what the crooks were taking off with.</p>

<p>Playability, again as an adult collector, I can see this being a nice addition for any child superhero fans, with the money bag able to serve in good stead of any villainous robberies a child could think up.</p>

<p>All together, I&#39;m very happy with this set, and feel that what it might lack in accessories that others may have, it more than makes up for it in the amount of printing done on it. It makes me wish that they would do a Hall of Doom set, or hopeful that they may do more characters that I could use for making my own Hall of Doom (and yes, I do realize that most of them have been made over the years, but think it would be great with this one and the Sinestro CMF if they could update many of them and make them available today... plus, it&#39;s the Legion of Doom!)</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-16T19:37:53.77Z","Feline Nemesis.","<p><b>Set #71026 Cheetah:</b>&nbsp;A familiar villain to Wonder Woman is Cheetah. Introduced here for the first time in her original design, she charges onto the scene with a full print all across the torso, arms, legs, head piece and tail for the cheetah spots. Her costume includes a new head piece with cat ears that slides over the face. She features two expressions, angry and smirking.</p>

<p>She includes a familiar sack in green to symbolise her theft of money from a bank, it is printed with a dollar sign. Cheetah is poised to strike down Wonder Woman and escape with her ill-gotten goods thanks to the two new display stand elements that are included.</p>

<p>Overall a must own villain for fans of the series. Highly Recommended.</p>

<p>Cheetah is most likely Wonder Woman&#39;s most iconic foe from her very inception. Lego, (before the DC CMF series) had only made one previous variant of her, based on her newer look. But, coming from someone who owns both, this is far superior.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>She has a unique head attachment with cheetah spots printed in brown, a head featuring a devious smirk and another featuring one of great aggression, her torso is brilliantly detailed with more spot detailing, she has a tail hip-attachment with more spot detailing to continue the design, and she has legs with spots printed on the front and sides, just like the torso.</p>

<p>The Accessory-</p>

<p>Her single accessory is a brilliant green sack piece with a large comic dollar sign ($) printed on the side, this works brilliantly as a comic accurate accessory and is useful for other figures and settings.&nbsp;The stand is the standard black CMF stand with a 1x2 black jumper plate and an action pose piece for various display options.</p>

<p>In Conclusion-</p>

<p>This is a great Minifigure from a great series, the detail is consistent and accurate to the vintage comics. From the series, I&#39;d say this falls into the category of a very good figure, due to some others being far superior to most minifigures, so&nbsp;that is why I&#39;d recommend it to anyone who has an interest.&nbsp;</p>
