"Somnium","2020-11-22T23:05:00.67Z","Superman Rebirth","<p>Since it&#39;s a collectable minifigure, I&#39;ll go straight to the pros and cons:</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<p>- Detailed torso printing with muscles. Also, back and legs printing.</p>

<p>- Exclusive double-sided&nbsp;face, one with a gentle smile and another with heat vision. The former looks very angry, with dark circles giving him a very&nbsp;villainous look (perfect for a Homelander custom!).</p>

<p>- Daily Planet newspaper. The news headline and the &ldquo;photo&rdquo; with tiny Superman holding a falling plane are incredibly detailed.</p>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<p>- Kinda plain when compared to other figures in the series. After all, a Superman with this doubled sided face isn&#39;t exactly new.</p>

<p>- I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a regular flaw but mine has&nbsp;a misprint in the heat vision face with a white line on the right side of both eyes.</p>

<p>- No extra trans clear piece of the flying effect. Shame.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Veredict: a great minifigure but if you already have a Superman, and you&#39;re satisfied with it, then you can pass this one. But for the price, the newspaper and heat vision face are welcome additions.</p>

He comes with all the familiar parts, but features new unique printing for his costume. Even his head is re-used with the familiar laser beam blasting expression on one side and the regular Superman smile on the other.</p>

<p>Carrying a copy of the Daily Planet, Caped Wonder Stuns City, reads the headline. Superman is somewhat average for the CMF line and really is only there for people who want variants or are looking for some spare parts for Convention Center MOCs. Overall still Recommended, but only mildly. Mildly Recommended.</p>

"Batjay23","2021-07-17T17:49:04.973Z","This is REBIRTH Superman, not New 52.","<p>Firstly as the title implies, I&#39;m disappointed in&nbsp;those reviews claiming this to be new 52 Superman. It&#39;s rebirth. New 52 is much different. The image you&#39;ll see below is of the Rebirth suit, it matches beautifully. Secondly I own three of this minifigure. I love it!<br />
Building experience 3: There&#39;s not much to building a minifigure. It was easy and fun, but not exactly unique.<br />
Value for money 4: The price of collectable minifigures has gone up in recent years, but I got this one at Walmart where it was cheaper than normal, so price was great for the set.<br />
Parts 4: Not much to say except the only pieces I had&nbsp;were Superman&#39;s hair and the display plate. So its parts were great!<br />
&nbsp;Playability 5: I love using this version of Superman, I use this version as the closest suit resembling the new suit on the Superman &amp; Lois tv series. As well as for other play. It fits well with the rebirth Batman minifigure I have.</p>

<p>Overall Rating 5: I love this guy, his design, parts, and the fact I have three of him.<br />
I recommend this one, and wish Lego would do a second series of collectable DC superheroes minifigures.</p>

<p><em>Apparently this collectable version of superman is based off of the NEW52 superman from the 52 comic book series. Well, If so, then there a some&nbsp;things blatantly wrong with this character.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>First: his belt is completely wrong. There are huge&nbsp;gaps in the front, when the belt should be continuos all around his waste. Also the shape of the buckle is wrong, depicting a rhombus, when the shape should match the diamond-shaped logo on his chest.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>Second: where are his red boots? Seriously? Why didn&#39;t they give this character dual moulded legs? It is simply unforgivable. What we get is a simple&nbsp;red lining which just looks odd.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><em>Third: his cape should depict a black &quot;superman-S&quot; at the back. I know LEGO can do prints on these capes, so I don&#39;t understand why they didn&#39;t. It would have truly lifted this figure to another level and make sure no one would complain about the 5&euro; price mark.</em></p>

<p><em>So no redeeming factors? Well,...</em></p>

<p><em>The newspaper is a fine touch (although it has a bad print-job), his torso muscle detailing is splendid, just marvellous. And his double-sided face is pretty good. I LOVE his evil red eyed grin. It is so sinister.</em></p>

<p><em>So, to wrap it up: this is mediocreman,...at best!</em></p>

<p><b>EDIT:</b></p>

<p>I am never too proud to admit to being wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, this appears to be the rebirth superman and not the new52 superman.</p>

<p>That being said, does it change anything? No, it doesn&#39;t. The choice for the rebirth superman is odd, specifically because the series got a lot of negative attention from fans, claiming the stories are boring, bland and meh...</p>

<p>And the character is the same thing still: boring, bland and meh...</p>

<p>Due to Superman recently being announced to be significantly changed in the next run of comics, I thought this would be a perfect occasion to review this controversial Minifigure from last year&#39;s DC CMF series.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The hair is the same Superman hair used since 2012, the head has a smiling face and an amazing angry face which is the best Superman head ever made, the cape is just plain red and the torso and legs depict his rebirth outfit which looks very good overall.</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>The single accessory is a 2&times;2 white tile newspaper claiming &ldquo;caped wonder stuns city&rdquo; which is an appropriate and cool inclusion. The stand is the standard black CMF stand with a 1&times;2 black jumper and the action pose piece for extra display ability.#&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This Minifigure is quite good and well-made, it is just the fact it is the rebirth suit and not the first appearance one like Batman, Wonder Woman, Cyborg and The Flash in this CMF, however this is still a good figure that I recommend to Superman and DC fans alike .</p>
