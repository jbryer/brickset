"Studded_Dud","2020-08-02T22:02:13.967Z","Green Lantern With A Lantern","<p>Parts: This minifigure includes 9 pieces. The basic minifigure series stand is included but there is also the action pose stand that is included in the DC minifigure series. That stand is included of a black 1x2 jumper plate and a clear piece introduced with this series. He holds a Green Lantern ring made of two pieces. He also holds a lantern piece. The lantern piece is a great piece for any future Green Lanterns.</p>

<p>Playability: Simon Baz is one of many from the Green Lantern Corps. He fits in great with other Green Lantern&#39;s or with any other DC superhero. Combining him with others makes great playability with endless super possibilities!</p>

<p>Value for Money: This set cost $4.99 and included 9 pieces. It would be nice if the price wasn&#39;t so high, but that&#39;s how it&#39;s going to be for minifigures now. Having 9 pieces and a few extras it makes this one not as bad with the new high price.</p>

<p>Minifig: This minifigure nails the look of Simon Baz. He has printing on his legs, torso, and face. He has half printed arms making it look as if he has sleeves. The printing on this minifigure feels a little bit 3d which is interesting but also quite nice.</p>

<p>Overall: Overall this is yet another great Green Lantern minifigure as all the others before it have been. It nails the look of Simon Baz and makes it a great addition to any Justice League or Green Lantern Corps.</p>

As I do not read the comics I&#39;m not 100% sure which Lantern this is, but I know he&#39;s very welcome.</p>

<p>Included is a Green Power Battery and Power Ring, which I neglected to mention is a printed 1x1 tile attached to the 1x1 with bar attchment used for hand accessories in most Super Heroes sets. His print features some minor hard to see detailing on his back, the front abs/costume detail, side-arm printing for the sleeves. Dual-moulded feet and arms and a simple printed masked head.</p>

<p>Overall a very solidly built character and easy to cast as some generic member of the Corps in background shots if you purchase multiples to give Power Batteries to all of your other Green Lanterns. A great figure and Highly Recommended.</p>

"Bowtie_Bricks","2022-10-10T15:25:52.03Z","Beware Green Lantern's Light!","<p>Simon Baz is one of the lesser known Green Lanterns, being introduced in DC&#39;s New 52. However, the figure is still a welcome addition to the lineup of Lego Lanterns. His figure is one that I personally have many of, mostly for the lantern and ring!</p>

<p>The dual moulded legs and arms are perfect, with the legs being simple enough to use for many other superhero and villains alike. His arms, while not as useful, do give a different short slieve flesh tone.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I find that the printing on his head and torso is almost 3-D, where it feels like it has some sort of layer to it. It&#39;s hard to describe, but with the figure in hand it is much more apparent. Beautiful printing overall, with the green standing out on the black.</p>

<p>The new lantern mould is suburb, as it perfectly represents the iconic device. The construction of the ring with a printed lantern logo on a hand holding piece. This creates a simple ring to give all other lanterns, simple yet effective.</p>

<p>Overall a great figure, and a cheap and easy way to get another lantern for your Justice League!</p>
