He features a lot of detailed printing for his outfit and you get to see more of his original form as this was before a lot of that was covered up by his cybernetics. On top of that he features side-arm printing and side-leg printing for the technical details of his suit.</p>

<p>Included with him are two purple chains and the unique new flight stand element that allows you to simulate flying. Only one side of his face is printed, this is because it&#39;s on a metal head with the flesh tone printed, if it were double-sided it wouldn&#39;t look proper when removed.</p>

<p>Overall an impressive variant with some very nice detailing and a good selection of parts. Recommended.</p>

<p>Cyborg is a popular character, but since the release of &#39;The Snyder Cut&#39; earlier this year, I don&#39;t think he&#39;s ever been so popular and this Minifigure based on his first appearance is fantastic.</p>

<p>The Minifigure -</p>

<p>He has an exclusive dual moulded helmet hair combo with his red eye printed, he has a silver head with his face printed on which surprisingly possesses the right amount of opacity, his torso is great featuring layered printing and dual moulded arms with side printing and his legs are also very detailed&nbsp;with front and side printing.</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>The single included accessory is a purple short length chain to emulate him breaking out of it like he does on the cover of his first comic appearance. The stand is the standard black CMF stand with the standard DC 1&times;2 black jumper with the action pose piece for pose simulations.</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This is one of the best Minifigures of this CMF series, not my personal favourite, but he is definitely up there, the printing is top-notch and continues the trend of Cyborg Minifigures being superb (also there is a spare purple chain which is pretty cool) so for that, I recommend this figure to Minifigure and DC fans alike.</p>
