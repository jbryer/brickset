<p>Having a collection of quite a few Batman figures, I knew I had to get this one. At first I wasn&#39;t too sure if I would like it , but it grew on me over time before I bought it and it sure was a pleasant surprise.</p>

<p>Of course every Batman needs his utility belt, batarang and mask. The legs are well done using dual-molding for the boots and &quot;tights&quot;printed on them, it&#39;s a very simple design, and&nbsp;I could really see it be used for a custom Batman:The Animated Series version of him. The torso is also simple to fit his first appearance design, his hands are in lavender which was a pretty interesting color to see with Batman, he&#39;s got his utility belt printed on there&nbsp;, of course also his abs and a bat logo that looks more different and retro than what we&#39;re used to. The back of the torso is also printed with the continuation of the utility belt and some backbone printing as well, I&#39;m glad he had printing on the back and didn&#39;t fall into the trap of &#39;no back torso printing because a cape covers it&#39; that some figures fall into. The cape is the Batman cape from the softer material that we all know. The face print was pretty interesting, the white eyes from this version of Batman uses goggles printing that could be seen&nbsp;when you remove the mask and it fits&nbsp;perfectly into the holes for the eyes of the mask, the rest of the face print&nbsp;&nbsp;is his usual stern face. What sucks though is that Lego didn&#39;t give him an alternate face, which is a&nbsp;bit disappointing , but at the end of the day, it doesn&#39;t bother me too much. His mask is a new mold that looks very similar to a Wolverine mask especially&nbsp;with the very pointy ears, it&#39;s a well made piece that brings another interesting addition to the Batman mask variants. For his accessory, he has 2. First is the batarang recolored in blue (which I believe it&#39;s a new color , but I&#39;m not too sure) , giving you a new variant to the&nbsp;batarang collection as well, I didn&#39;t expect an extra of it&nbsp;, so&nbsp;I was really happy with the inclusion. His second accessory is the long rope&nbsp;in black, which isn&#39;t the typical accessory you would commonly see in a CMF, which is nice and the rope itself adds to the accuracy of Batman&#39;s appearance on his first comic book cover.</p>

<p>Overall I think this figure is one of the best&nbsp;figures of the series. It&#39;s another great Batman variant that&#39;s pretty simple in design (which isn&#39;t a bad thing for this figure) and is accurate to his first appearance with great accessories. It&#39;s a very fun and collectible figure that definitely adds a great figure to your collection if you&#39;re a super hero&nbsp;or&nbsp;even a casual Lego&nbsp;fan, It&#39;s pretty good&nbsp;for the price and it gets my recommendation for a purchase.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-17T20:17:12.66Z","I am the Night! The First Knight!","<p><b>Set #71026 Batman:</b>&nbsp;This stunning variant of Batman is based on some of the earliest costume choices for the character, in his earliest appearances he was known to dress in this dark grey suit with larger bat ears on the cowl and the classic yellow utility belt. It is printed here rather than using the LEGO Batman movie Utility Belt piece.</p>

<p>He includes a batarang in blue (with one spare), a long chain element similar to the webbing strings used by earlier Spider-Man sets in black for swinging through Gotham. Dual-moulded legs, a facial print inside the cowl on a black head which includes goggles where is Bat eyes reside to make it look pretty fun. His bat logo is a smaller variant in black with no circular shield around it, and he comes with a soft-style cape.</p>

<p>Overall a very impressive figure and one worth owning for all Batman variant fans. Recommended.</p>

<p>Batman is the Lego character with the most variations period, and you obviously you can&#39;t exclude him from a DC Super Heroes CMF series and the choice made by Lego is undoubtedly the right avenue to take.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-&nbsp;</p>

<p>The cowl is a new mould depicting his first appearance design with comically large ears, he has a one sides stern facial expression, a black Batman cape, a printed torso with lavender hands and dual moulded legs with printing at the top.</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>The accessories include a nice exclusive blue Batarang and a barred black rope piece. The stand is the standard black CMF stand with the standard black 1&times;2 jumper and the action pose piece for extra display options.</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This is a great figure, not a personal favourite of mine but a great one, and it perfectly demonstrates what the CMF series should&#39;ve done for Superman, but that is a separate conversation and for now I very much recommend this figure to Batman and DC fans alike.</p>
