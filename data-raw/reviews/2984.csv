"Novelty","2007-04-07T07:54:23.037Z","Hither Here, Tither There","While it may not be obvious, this set seems to be a replacement for 6010.  Looking at it as a replacement, it's a minor disappointment.  Looking at it with fresh eyes, it is a solid design that's also looks good.

The chariot is well balanced despite the fact that the back can get extremely heavy when loaded with all the goodies provided by the set.  The bendy things that enclose the chariot lends it an interesting visual look as well.  Otherwise, it's rather standard as small sets go.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-10-13T09:54:41.28Z","Lots of weapons","Indeed the chariot itself is quite small, but there are lots of things that come with it: one spear, one shield, two axes and two words. And the three hoses used as arches look pretty good. However, it would have been nice if a knight on a horse had been included. So the soldier with the chariot would have had a companion; but that would certainly have made the set more expensive.

Aren't in the wagon all the weapons, two little axes stays in a little white part without connection in the cart. To keep the two swords, were used in this set three hoses(later used in many ufo sets), very useful to many themes. Is included in the cart also a flag and the same blue piece to connects with the horse, in this set have a white color, like one of the western sets. The colors looks like be the same of various carts, black. The knight uses a shield with a lion symbol, a helmet and a spear. The playabilty is the same of other wagons, makes the minifigure rides it when it is carried by the horse.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mngoult","2010-01-06T08:20:28.75Z","Why is there so much confsuion over Castle subthemes?","Depending on the website your visiting, they will have the set listed under different subthemes. This happens alot with Castle sets 6080 is classed as lion knights subtheme or Legoland subtheme. 

6016 is either crusaders or lion knights, the difference between these two themes seems completely arbitary as lion knight minifigs and crusader axe minifgis appear in both themes. 

Either way its a nice set, well build and has rare blue piece that clips on to the horse. Loads of weapons appear in this set which add to its usefullness and overall rating. 

A nice set worth three stars, nothing wrong with it but nothing special with it either.

Pros
Decent hareness for the horse.
Lots of weapons.
minifig has knights chest and a cape.

Cons
Just another small castle themed lego set.
It has lots of weapons but lets not get carried away and call it an arsenal.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-14T15:18:25.573Z","King's Arsenal","<p>As far as all of the wagons that can be found within the Castle theme, this set is a good solid design.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have a Cart with two castle theme wheels pulled by a white horse. There's a lion knight minifigure with a shield and spear who's driving the cart. Within the cart are a pair of swords and axes being transported. A red flag finalizes it out for accessories.</p>

"Steamus","2011-04-02T17:10:12.17Z","Strange ""tubes""","The charioteer is well equipped, the chariot is loaded with weapons, and the balance between horse and chariot is acceptable, but I'm not too fond of the ""tubes"" covering the arsenal. They don't look very medieval to me. I also think the axes look a little out of place. They fit better in a fire station set than in a castle set if you ask me.",FALSE,3,2,3,3,4
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-01-30T18:04:27.79Z","Weapon Wagon","<p>Well this is&nbsp;certainly not that bad but possibly lacking besides an otherwise good inception.&nbsp;The Castle set cart idea seems simple enough and should present some simple easy to identify qualities; it&#39;s a two wheeled transport, arguably a mini build or just about, it&#39;s transporting some weapons, it is black and it belongs to the Lion Knights.</p>

<p>I love the red tunic/ silver armour printed torsos and the blue cloaks are always ace. Combined with the usual guard helmet this designs a different kind of rank among the knights. As the lions go it&#39;s fairly fancy with the alternate shield. An unusual combination but variety is good. I can never be too keen on the blue trousers when&nbsp;the available grey would have suited armour better.</p>

<p><b>Steaming Pony Trap</b><br />
The design is a little strained, similar to others without a clear or chunky boxed area to be laden with much cargo and a little light on build as often is the case. The turntable fitted shafts and some slanted undersides make for a working and sturdy design.. A strange choice of tubes better suited in the Space theme make &#39;wrought iron&#39; bars cleverly for protection but sadly lack any &#39;canvas&#39; covering. These parts can be annoying as they disconnect themselves and are not very bricky. A single horse pulls the weight here, again.&nbsp;A flag flies on top and looks the part.</p>

<p>Call me ungrateful but this is the knight&#39;s&nbsp;arsenal.&nbsp;Two swords, a spear and a couple of small axes on a block seems less than a trader might carry. Just check out&nbsp;6010, the mere peasant has at three weapons, including a large axe plus a hammer. This bloke above could have multiple weapons clipped in to the ride.</p>

<div>
<p>Seeing as brown bricks are not really widely available its usually a choice between grey, black and a combination of others. The colour scheme is among the high points in this set and worth noting that a similar white block design holds weapons in another Castle set.&nbsp;The red seat looks pretty regal in front of the black cart and ironwork contrasting the white horse really well.</p>

<p><b>Ala Cart</b><br />
That&#39;s about it really. Ive tried to review this more harshly as carts have succeeded aplenty before this stage and it just does not look quite as much with the strange tubes and slightly less form. Saying that it scores extra&nbsp;as a good first set and as a favourite small set for a few Castle collectors but that&#39;s fairly generous to this standard but unremarkable set for the theme.</p>

"Ernst","2017-12-25T16:42:49.917Z","Lion Knight or Crusader ?? Fine for both.","<p><strong>Overall 4 bricks : </strong>I love these small sets from the old Castle themes. As far as the theme, you can add it to both Lion Knights and Crusaders. It are more and more becoming collectors items instead of playing sets. Still available for a reasonable price on Bricklink.</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks :</strong> Not a challenging build of course, a fun small cart and a block for the axes and/or swords.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 3 bricks :</strong> Considering the name the present weapons could have some more but it is acceptable. It&#39;s not a set to take apart and put the parts in your collection.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 3 bricks : </strong>Standing alone it is not a great playing set, it is mend as an army builder to add it with your other Castle sets.</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks : </strong>The set is in the Netherlands still available on <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?S=6016-1#T=S&amp;O={&quot;loc&quot;:&quot;NL&quot;,&quot;iconly&quot;:0}"">Bricklink</a> for some &euro;5.00 to &euro;10.00 in used condition which is ok for a 30 year old set I guess for a collector.</p>

However, it didn&#39;t come with a saddle piece for the horse, just in case the soldier wanted to ride without the cart.&nbsp; Ah, well.&nbsp; With his spear, shield, swords, and axes, I know this warrior sent many enemies fleeing for safety all the same!!</p>
