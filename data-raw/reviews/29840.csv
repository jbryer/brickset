"PerryThePlatypus","2020-02-16T16:05:14.313Z","A great figure to add to your collection!","<p>I wasn&#39;t too familiar with the character of Huntress, but the great black and purple color scheme, useful parts and detailing made it a must buy&nbsp;for me.</p>

<p>The legs use a dual molded design that has purple boots and some stripe printing that carries on to the hips. Huntress also comes with a&nbsp;utility belt in purple, though the coloring isn&#39;t new, (came with the Catwoman&nbsp;minifigure&nbsp;from the Lego Batman Movie&nbsp;sets) it&#39;s a nice way to get it cheap, and there&#39;s also an extra which I was really happy with. The torso is highly detailed with the white stripes&nbsp;printing from the legs ,&nbsp;(what seems to me) the resemblance of a &#39;T&#39; or her symbol on the front. She has great arm printing with the continuation of purple and she also has back torso printing, which I&#39;m glad was included because Lego sometimes cheap out from back printing when the figure has a cape. Speaking of cape , the cape included with her is the newer style cape that has the softer material, which IMO is way better than the original papery cape. Her accessory is the crossbow, which is a nice cheap way to get it. Her double sided&nbsp;face prints have a smiling and an angry/struggling expression both with her purple mask on. Her hair piece is especially useful for custom figures, it&#39;s a recolor&nbsp;of the DCEU&nbsp;Wonder Woman hair piece that was previously in brown, it&#39;s my favorite hair piece of the series. And of course , as all figures of the DC series, she comes with a jumper piece and a clear posing piece to pose your figures in any way you want which was a cool idea and was executed pretty well here.</p>

<p>Overall, this is one of my favorite figures of the series, it has the things I look for in a good minifigure: a great hair piece , useful parts , and good detailing. It doesn&#39;t use any new molds, which is fine because it wasn&#39;t really required. It gets my recommendation for all those good qualities and bringing a cool figure to your collection!</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-17T20:27:18.497Z","She stalks the night.","<p><b>Set #71025 Huntress:</b>&nbsp;This DC Bat-Family member hasn&#39;t been seen in LEGO Sets until now, dressed in a purple costume and carrying a crossbow, Huntress is a deadly assassin who doesn&#39;t quite play by Batman&#39;s rules. Raised by a mob father, she chose to fight crime rather than join it and is often blacklisted for being a killer.</p>

<p>With Dual-Moulded legs and a soft-goods cape Huntress looks stunning, her costume is accurately depicted complete with the white strapping on her torso in the shape of a T, she includes a nice purple utility belt and some decent printing for her facial expressions with a smiling face on one side and an angrier face on the other.</p>

<p>Huntress is a very violent character, fans will love seeing her here and being able to purchase her. Others may not approve of such a violent heroine for their collection. It&#39;s all a matter of person preference. I Recommend her for her design and because she&#39;s an awesome looking character in Minifigure form. Recommended.</p>

<p>Huntress is a DC character from the 2020 CMF series that I was previously familiar with, unlike some (eg; Mister Miracle or Metamorpho) and I firmly believe LEGO did a great job depicting Helena Bertinelli in Minifigure form.</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The hair is the BvS Wonder Woman hair in black, the head has her purple crown printed on both sides with a smiling and aggressive facial expression, the cape is the newer style in black with a single neck hole, her torso has the iconic &#39;T&#39; shape in the centre with an accompanying set of printed arms, she has the &quot;LEGO Batman Movie&quot; Batman belt in purple which was used for Cat Woman in those sets and the legs have some boot printing over the black and purple dual moulded legs.</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>The single accessory is very appropriate being her signature crossbow in gun metal grey. The stand is the standard black CMF stand with a 1&times;2 black jumper with the action pose piece for extra display options.</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>This is a fantastic Minifigure with almost no complaints, other than she could have perhaps benefited from a new crown hair combo piece as the points of her purple crown go way above her hair in the comics, but I think what they did is perfectly acceptable, so with that I recommend this figure.</p>
