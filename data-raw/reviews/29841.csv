Meaning they can assume different shapes and abilities depending on what powers they are exposed to, to capture this feat LEGO created a very interesting looking Minifigure.</p>

<p>His torso is made with two different colours, orange and a dark maroon, his legs has one leg a muddy light brown and the other transparent clear similar to the Ice Tribes from Chima only less blue. He features impressive and detailed printing for his costume and belt, some nice side-printing on the arms and legs and an excellent heroic facial expression.One Gorilla Tribe gauntlet is included in the dark maroon colour of the left arm to simulate his ability to enlarge it and use it to pound villains.</p>

<p>Overall the parts alone are a pretty strong reason to pick up this awesome hero from the DC Super Heroes Series. They aren&#39;t useful for making different characters, but they are quite impressive. Highly Recommended.</p>
