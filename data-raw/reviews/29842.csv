<p>Joker is my second favorite figure from one of my (unpopular opinion alert) favorite CMF series .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Minifigure figure has a very nice hair piece of is Peter venkmens hair in spring green , the head is one sided but does have a prominent rendition of his signature smile his suit is not under detailed but is not amazing .</p>

<p>The accessories -</p>

<p>Accessories include a very nicely printed joker card and the same candy floss build that&#39;s included in the roller coaster . The stand also has the action pose piece introduced in 2020 .</p>

<p>In&nbsp;conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a great figure who brings a lot to the table in terms of interesting variants unlike the superman of the series .</p>

This variant of Joker is dressed all in white, with a purple undershirt visible beneath. He includes a printed Joker card tile and a Beehive element in pink to represent a piece of cotton candy.</p>

<p>A truly distrubing smile graces his lips and his hair piece is quite impressive. I forget just what version this is meant to be, a highly popular one to be sure from what I can recall. Joker is a great addition to the roster of Heroes and Villains from LEGO DC Super Heroes CMF Series 1 and I hope Series 2 will some day happen to grace us with many more impressive figures. Strongly Recommended.</p>
