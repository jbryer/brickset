Whoops, wrong franchise.","<p><b>Set #71025 Bumblebee:</b>&nbsp;Not to be confused with the Volkswagen of the same name from a different franchise, our friend here is a member of the Team Titans. Her Minifigure form shares similar design ideas from her Mini-Doll form over in DC Super Hero Girls, but this one has solid wings of hard plastic with printed bee wing pattern, a yellow and black top on her torso with plain unprinted legs, some nice facial expressions appropriate for the character. And, of course, some yellow energy bolt elements for her to attack with.</p>

<p>Bumblebee also includes a very nice looking new hair piece with a pair of buns on top and excellent sculpted detailing. Overall she&#39;s well worth picking up, and adds to your Teen Titans collection. Highly Recommended.</p>
