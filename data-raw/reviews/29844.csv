<p>This variant of the flash is undoubtedly the best minifigure of the character .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure has a very nice exclusive helmet mould based of a WW1 troop helmet that the flash used in the comics , his head is a nice print but unfortunately Lego is reusing it in a Jurassic world set this summer CMF pieces should stay exclusive to CMFs , his torso and neck attachment are nice and work well his legs are dual moulded and have nice printing on the side .</p>

<p>The accessories/stand-</p>

<p>Accessories include two trans yellow lightning bolt pieces to nicely show&nbsp;him running , his stand is the plain&nbsp; CMF stand , a 1&times;2 black jumper plate and the 2020 action pose piece that allows you to pose him in many positions .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a great figure my only issue isn&#39;t even his fault and that is the constant reuse of CMF pieces in other sets whether that be giraffe guys head in the creator expert bookshop or this figure it needs to stop now . Other than that I would definitely recommend this figure to any DC fans .&nbsp;</p>

So if you were hoping for more villains you&#39;ll have to wait and see what a possible Series 2 might bring.</p>

<p>The Flash, AKA Jay Garrick, is the original version from the 1940s and so is costumed accordingly. Dressed in a red top and featuring a lightning bolt on his chest, upside down compared to how Wally West has it on his uniform. His legs are dual-moulded with a belt and minor detailing visible for the wing symbols on his boots. He has a unique new hat piece and includes a clear back bracket, two lightning effects are attached to simulate the speed force as he runs.</p>

<p>Overall it&#39;s a very impressive version of a character from the Golden Age of DC Comics and goes great with the Wonder Woman and Batman first appearance from this series. Track one down if you can. Recommended.</p>
