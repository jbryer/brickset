<p>Bat-mite is a character who has appeared in direct to DVD Lego&nbsp;&nbsp;DC film&#39;s for years so this is great to get now .</p>

<p>The Minifigure-</p>

<p>The figure has a very nice exclusive cowl mould with one bent ear the face has the cartoony eyes and buckteeth the cape is a small Batman cape in blue the torso has appropriate and accurate printing the legs are a very nice triple moulded piece .</p>

<p>The accessory -</p>

<p>Accessories include an incredible detective comics no27 Batman first appearance this will be worth a lot in years time , the stand is the plain cmf stand , a 1&times;2 black jumper plate and the action pose piece which works well for other figures but not this one as his legs are not poseable .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this my favourite figure from my third favourite cmf series as a DC fan I would 100% recommend this to any other people who share my passion for it or just want that epic Accessory .</p>

Batman&#39;s #1 Fan, Self-Proclaimed, and a thorn in everyone&#39;s side. This particular Imp from a Paralle Dimension can cause my issues, as seen in the LEGO DC Special Be-Leagured.</p>

<p>Bat-Mite has some very nice parts. He has a custom&nbsp;costume with bat symbol sewn on, a loose fitting utility belt, a short soft-cloth cape, a cowl with one bent ear and triple-moulded short legs. He includes a printed tile piece which features a copy of Detective Comics #27 on it, the first appearance of Batman (which coincidentally is also in this series). Overall I&#39;m impressed with Bat-Mite, he looks very close to the 3-D model introduced in the animate special. My one complaint are with the hands, I&#39;m not sure if they suffer from being made of a softer material, but mine have stressed a bit from holding the comic tile in his hand.</p>
