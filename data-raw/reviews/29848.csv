<p>Attached to the cover of Issue 3 of the Hidden Side Comic is Parker L Jackson.&nbsp; She appears in a lot of the Hidden Side sets, but this is her first appearance in the comic line.&nbsp; This comic was on sale in the UK between 11th December 2019 and 7th January 2020.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The foil pack that is attached to the comic is of the flap type which has a very sticky flap holding the pieces in.&nbsp; The front shows Parker, looking very stern, hunting ghosts with her mobile phone and laptop.&nbsp; Behind her is a pink ghost and a green ghost.&nbsp; The suggested age is 7+, which as ever seems far too high compared to other comics that have lower ages.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the back of the packet is an image of Spencer, the dog from the series.&nbsp; Along with the safety information is the 1:1 image of Parker&#39;s phone.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>The main element of this set is the minifigure and other than Parker you only get two extra parts.&nbsp; Parker is exactly the same as the one within <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70419-1/Wrecked-Shrimp-Boat"">70419</a> (Wrecked Shrimp Boat) which is the only other set that she appears in as she does&nbsp;here.&nbsp; She has a double-sided&nbsp;head with the printing of two faces.&nbsp; One face is happy and the other is far more determined.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>There is no additional build here other than the Minifigure.&nbsp; The only parts you get are Parker&#39;s mobile phone, which comes with every set that she is in, and you get a black laptop.&nbsp; The laptop only appears in black in 8 sets, so is quite rare.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>The sets that appear on the comics really need to have some connectivity to the app.&nbsp; Currently they don&#39;t, which is a shame as that would add so much to the play value and a small mini-build could really help.&nbsp; As a standalone set this is quite disappointing.&nbsp; It&#39;s nice to add to the Hidden Side theme, but if you already have the Shrimp Boat then it won&#39;t add anything at all.</p>

<p>I do think that these sets are good value for money, but they could so easily be improved.</p>
