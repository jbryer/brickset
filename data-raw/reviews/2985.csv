"Novelty","2007-04-07T02:14:14.43Z","Row, row, row your...","This is a solid little boat that's great as a rivercraft.  There's nothings special about it but the design is sleek an interesting.  It was clever to use flags as the sail and a spear as the paddle - this was before the advent of the Pirates line.  Two minifigs and a pennant top this craft... literally.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-10-26T05:48:03.233Z","Small but fine","This is a small boat, but it is sufficient to guard a moat, for instance. What you get are two heavily armed soldiers: two shields and two weapons. The minifig with the spear also has a blue cape. And I find it was a pretty good idea to use four white flags as sails. It also looks good when there is a lake in your castle layout on which you can put it. Just use large blue baseplates (627) as lakes. Or go to a shop that sells paper, glue, scissors and so on. There you can buy blue paper which you can use as lakes. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-11T09:35:33.78Z","Little boat","This is another small set from the lion knights subtheme. This is basically a boat that don't floats, but still cool and useful, for armies or also a building. The set don't have a building, but builting with the contents of the boat, is easy to make one. It have two minifigures, with the same details of the lion knights. The boat have an easy builting and is very compatible with other lego, is easy too make a bigger boat with it's contents. The color scheme were more used in old sets, like the blue and black colors, used in carts, chariots or wagons. It have white pieces to looks like with sails and above it have a red flag. The rails on the sides like protections for keep the minifigures inside the boat. A spear and an axe are included, to be additions and weaponry to armies. The boat have also details like the black parts on the front and back, little and don't very detailed due to the boat's size. The playability, like i said, isn't making it floats because it can't, but is make the minifigures keep in the boat against other boats and other minifigures or create a new one.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mngoult","2010-01-06T08:27:02.373Z","If it contains a crusader lion surely it should be in the crusaders subtheme.","The smaller version of a boat by the grey knights (the other being Viking voyager). The idea of sails on this one is nice even if the mast is unsteady.

Two minifigs is good for a small set and they seem well armed. Why there was so many boats made at this time is beyond me especially considering there are all rougthly the same size.

Blue is an interesting choice, the white trim doesn't work and more detail should have been placed on the front and back sections, like the dragon statue in 6018.

No major problems, a solid if unspectacular three stars. 

Pros
Two minfigs.
Shields always welcome.

Cons
Another boat with the potential to attack strongholds of a wet flannel.
Random colours, any one rememeber blue railway sleepers?",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-01-21T05:42:35.93Z","Up Brick Creek Without a...","Thats right, no paddle and no oars either. Just a spear and an axe that the poor guard is feebly trying to row with. Maybe the king's budget got spent on too many castles and carts, leaving the boat and oar fund a bit empty.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4></div><div><ul><li>Blue cloak.</li></ul></div><div>A skirt helmeted guard with a flash armoured top along with the usual red and blue threads joins a&nbsp;lion chest badged, tall helmeted guard with a trendy blue cloak and brown spear.</div><div><br><div><b>Sea Lions</b></div><div>This is a pretty decent boat design for the Lion Knights army in Castle. The inclusion of boats probably led many to dream of some proper vikings that would not appear for another eighteen years. The diagonal chamfer form under and over bricks gave loads of shape design for the likes of aeroplanes and boats as well as canopies and some general flexibility in design.</div><div><br></div><div>This boat is a smart but unashamedly blue mediaeval mini barge. Why the blue and sometimes red bricks got so overused in unsuitable theme areas when grey and black were available is beyond me. Maybe its because the bright colours were intended to attract kids and I'm now a fussy AFOL. Perhaps some of us fussy kids would have agreed though?</div><div><br></div><div>The clean white top makes a smart line so our two guards can look the height of class at the local castle yacht club. This model is a straight forward but enjoyable little build, not too complex just a little fiddly. The central mast is a headlight block held lance adapted to hold the four white flags/banners to try and catch some wind. Yep thats right, just one large thin four by four stud white brick with clips would have looked a stronger and more suited design but this looks pretty good anyhow. The red proper flag blows happily as a good top piece.</div><div><br></div><div>The black side grating is ok as some fancy wooden lattice barrier to hold the crew and any contents in but the black bow and stern that are a symmetrical build, hold a small problem. The upward diagonal bricks work ok but the last piece scrimps on a stud worth of brick each end so that a flimsy one stud join is made to hold the two stud thin shaft on each end. A different go at this might be to use a x2 one stud wide, two brick high black sloping bricks and then a long slope on top. This would decrease boat space but make a more attractive and strong bow and stern. To be honest the boat has so little space, that if the king or a treasure chest jumps aboard, everyone is going for a swim.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Oars, Oars, My Kingdom For Some Oars</b></div><div>Those two guards are typical Lion Knight fare with some good shields for decor. This was a fun model to try and set sail in a sink or bath with the result of a fail but entertained nonetheless. Its a decent enough model and welcome in the Castle them but it might not quite float your boat.</div></div>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
"AETerry","2011-01-14T01:49:17.8Z","King's Oarmen Review","<p>This is an older set from back&nbsp;in 1987, a couple years before the Pirates theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time I'd grabbed and picked it up wanting more of the Lion Knights as part of building an army as the Dragon Knights were becoming more predominent among the sets along with the Forestmen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's an okay little build for a ship, I just never found much I could do with it. Too small to be an invading Viking crew. So perhaps guarding a moat or river way then.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With the availability of bricks and elements for then, this is a good simple build. The ends or prow and stern of the boat are built much the same so the boat can move in any direction that's needed. White little flags are attached to a lance to function as sails. the Oarsman is using a battle axe as an oar.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two little minifigures isn't bad. Two shields, one of which is a blue lion shield and the other a yellow shield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a good little, though simple set and model. Back in the days of when I was trying to collect up all the Lego sets I could. So small sets were always easy to pick and get.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4
"Heisenberg","2017-11-12T18:15:05.65Z","Two Knights on a boat","<p>I remember buying this with my pocket&nbsp;money when I was &nbsp;four.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is the set that got me hooked on Lego. &nbsp;I recently acquired a new copy but I still have&nbsp;my original which was well played with. Here are my thoughts from now and then.</p>

<h3><strong>Packaging</strong></h3>

<p>This is the classic castle presentation. &nbsp;Yellow Legoland&nbsp;box with picture of the model. &nbsp;The scene is posed well on what I suspect to be a cake stand. &nbsp;Whatever it is it&#39;s a good representation of water. &nbsp;The back of the box shows alternative models such as a riverside camp.</p>

<h3><strong>Build and Parts</strong></h3>

<p>Instructions are simple and well designed making it a straightforward build. &nbsp;I never kept the instructions when I was a kid but could always remember how to build this.</p>

<p>Notable parts are the blue slope pieces and white flags which I believe made their debut in this set. &nbsp;The flags are used&nbsp;to good&nbsp;effect in creating the sails.</p>

<h3><strong>Mini-figures</strong></h3>

<p>Two knights&nbsp;well&nbsp;armed with axe&nbsp;and spear. &nbsp;One wears a printed breastplate and the other a printed&nbsp;lion crest surcoat&nbsp;along with a blue cloak piece. &nbsp;The same lion appears on their Shields. &nbsp;Lego did very well with the design and they look authentic. &nbsp;In fact the heraldic lion looks very similar to that of the Scottish King&nbsp;Robert the Bruce.</p>

<p>I feel Lego lost this realism in later themes but in this&nbsp;and&nbsp;others of this era&nbsp;they got it right.</p>

<h3><strong>The finished model and playability</strong></h3>

<p>It makes a great looking boat. &nbsp;A bit of imagination is required to use the axe as a rudder but if we didn&#39;t have that then we wouldn&#39;t have Lego.</p>

<p>Loads of fun can be had with this set. &nbsp;It made many voyages around the house and even sailed into&nbsp;the car on a few occasions. &nbsp;The Knights can&nbsp;dismantle their boat and build a campsite, just like on the box.</p>

<p>If displaying your Lego is more your thing then this fits in and will&nbsp;complement a larger castle setup. &nbsp;It even looks great just sat by itself&nbsp;on my desk.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall</strong></h3>

<p>Subjectively and putting nostalgia aside I think this is a&nbsp;fine example of a classic set. &nbsp;Simple but implemented well. &nbsp;I think it still holds up to today&#39;s standards, so&nbsp;full marks from me.</p>

<p>Saying that,&nbsp;there is still a part of me that wants to sail it around the house.</p>
