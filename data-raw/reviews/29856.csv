<p>Issue 22 of the Lego City Comic comes with two sets attached.&nbsp; The new set exclusive to this issue contains Jack Lumber, and he comes with his power saw, log and cradle.&nbsp; I also got the first space set to be attached to the Lego City Comic <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/951908-1/Astronaut"">951908</a>, which does not really compliment this set but if you started collecting from Issue 21 it would be great to add to your collection.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The foil packet shows off the contents well and as ever indicates that this is not for under 6&#39;s.&nbsp; A generic construction worker is pictured in the top right corner adjacent to the Lego and City logo&#39;s.</p>

<p>On the back there is a 1:1 image of the red cone that makes up part of the saw.&nbsp; Most of the back is taken up with the standard copyright and safety information.&nbsp; I personally feel that these packets are too large for what they contain.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Jack Lumber is the latest addition to the Lego City Comic.&nbsp; His attire is well suited as he sports eye protection and a hi-visibility vest over his brown shirt.&nbsp; His unprinted legs are Sand Blue and can be found in 91 sets, so are very common.&nbsp; The torso&nbsp;is Bright Orange and printed front and back and has appeared in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6102566"">twelve sets</a> since 2015 that range in value.&nbsp; The arms are Reddish Brown and he has Dark Stone Grey gloves.&nbsp;Mini Head 914 suits Jack very well but as this is quite a common part, appearing in 41 sets since 2015, it would be great to get a less used part.&nbsp; Jack is also wearing a very common Bright Red helmet.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts&nbsp;</h3>

<p>Sometimes these sets give you some rare pieces, but that is not the case here.&nbsp;Similar&nbsp;builds of the saw have&nbsp;been used previously, and the log is only four 2x2 round bricks put together.&nbsp; The stand is solid enough and adds a play value.&nbsp; The build of non-Minifigure element is only 13 pieces so won&#39;t tax anyone.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>&pound;4.99 for&nbsp;two sets and a comic is certainly good value, and if you already own <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60059-1/Logging-Truck"">60059</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60181-1/Forest-Tractor"">60181</a> then this will compliment them perfectly.&nbsp; It seems strange that Jack has appeared now as the recent wave of City Lego excludes anything that is of this kind.&nbsp; However, as I write this the London Toy Fair is going on, so maybe there are sets to be released later in 2020 that will match the theme nicely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With what has been released in January 2020 I would like to see the Lego Comic provide something to go with the tuning/performance vehicles.&nbsp; I would particularly like to see a safari issue of the comic too, which could come with a Minifigure and animal.</p>

<p>As on the 15th&nbsp;January 2020 the next issue is available and will contain yet another police set.</p>
