"Studded_Dud","2020-07-25T00:24:38.103Z","It was free","<p>Building Experience: This set is very well-built and looks great in the Hidden Side theme. The dragster looks amazing. On each side there is a part that flips out to reveal that the dragster has been possessed and now has eyes. The cannon on the back doesn&#39;t actually mean much for the car but it is all for the play.</p>

<p>Parts: The parts in this set are amazing, and it contains 134 of them. To begin with there are no stickers in this set, but there is only one printed piece. That printed piece is Jack&#39;s phone, although it isn&#39;t really all that special because it appears in many other sets. This set contains quite a few long bones which look great on the side of the dragster. It also has macaroni tube pieces that work very well for what they resemble. It includes a launcher which is also a nice addition to the pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability: There is a bit of playability for this set. I&#39;m sure that it works great with the app but I do not have that, so I can&#39;t really say if it is good or not. There is the canon on the back that shoots out the possessed man, and the car has spinning wheels but other than that there&#39;s not much special about it for it to be played with.</p>

<p>Value for Money: There&#39;s not much to say about the value for money for this set because it was free so that kind of makes it perfect for what it was worth!</p>

<p>Minifigures: The minifigures in this set are decent. Jack comes in many other sets so and there&#39;s nothing different about this one and the other ones that look like him. Dwayne is also in another set so that makes him not that special either but his torso looks cool if you are trying to make a biker gang for you city or a moc.</p>

<p>Overall: This set is has great value for what it was worth, it was free. But even though it is now you can&#39;t get it free if you can find it cheap, I still think that it would be worth picking up.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-11-04T16:18:18.277Z","Race your Spectral Racers to the Hidden Side","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set # 40408 Drag Racer:</b> This second, and no doubt final Hidden Side GWP, was made available at the beginning of 2020 around February or so before the huge issues we&rsquo;ve had set in. The set doesn&rsquo;t feature a lot of transformation elements, but still includes those play aspects of the sets which focus on Ghosts possessing civilian areas.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This little box has the same loveable art design of the theme and extremely stylized imagery for the front of the box. It&rsquo;s fairly clear what the front and back of the box is designed to be. Mostly because all the boxes are taped closed a certain way. Either way, it&rsquo;s a decent enough design and well worth keeping in case you like keeping your packages.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is small and features all the necessary steps in easy to follow along with to construct the model. There&rsquo;s also a nice shot of the new sets from the wave in the beginning of 2020. Overall a decent enough manual.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set does not feature a lot of elements that are too unique, but there is a nice colour selection, a mixture of red, dark red and black parts. Plus two printed ghost/monster eye reverse radars.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Dwayne: Possessed Dwayne is here and ready to run down the heroes of Newbury with his haunted drag racer. Wearing a biker jacket with the Hares of Havoc logo on the back. It&rsquo;s very impressive to get a figure here with this level of detail that could work in a ghostly gang jacket. He has no accessories however, which is unfortunate.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Jack: Included for the third time is Jack dressed in his white sweat jacket with the white hoodie and red cap combo. The print and parts are identical to the version we covered in the Shrimp Boat set. Overall a nice inclusion, something that isn&rsquo;t rare so you can maybe make this set with everything from your own collections.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Constructing this model we have a load of fun building a massive drag racer. This build is quick and easy, but it weakly incorporates the ghostly transformation into the set. It is really quick too and doesn&rsquo;t rely on any stickers, so there is that. The only odd choice is to have this build on the back of the vehicle for a launcher with nothing to actually launch from it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Drag Racer is a low to the ground racing vehicle that has flames flying out of the engine, this model is equipped with two panels that can flip open to reveal spectral eyes, indicating this miniature vehicle has been possessed and has the transformation feature most sets include. The only problem is there isn&rsquo;t a mouth, I feel this model would have looked even more impressive is the long front nose section had been given an opening mouth with fangs in it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kind of like an old Real Ghostbusters toy built out of LEGO. It would have made this ten times more impressive. Still it&rsquo;s a fairly solid model and works well. Though I&rsquo;m still not sure why they included a launcher without any nets or things to launch.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a great little Gift With Purchase and I&rsquo;d definitely recommend it. It fits in quite nicely with the overall theme and works brilliantly. Loved the overall look of the model and the Minifigures are equally nice to have. The only real issue involved here was, of course, I feel the model could have had more to it to transform it into a scary ghost car. Overall, still, Recommended.</p>
