<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>T-Rex looks great, Much better than on a packaging. It is a good representation of this kinda classical creature. I don&#39;t know in which scale it is designed, but fits very well with nanofigs. It looks sort of majestical. It has everything that good dinosaur should have. Its head can be turned side to side, as well as rotated. Jaws open up and allow him to eat a nanofig. Arms are tiny (it&#39;s good) and can be moved separately. Legs have a very muscular look. Feet&nbsp;are designed in this very distinguished way. I think you could make a nice footprint of them. He can be posed in many ways, which is great, cause LEGO hardly ever gives us the opportunity to do so. So he can either walk or stand. Though it&#39;s really hard and quite weird position, he is able to stand on one leg. Tail is simple, yet looks good enough. It also can be turned in every single direction.</p>

<p>Overall it presets surprisingly good. Its head has a great design, I couldn&#39;t expect more. Foot looks amazing as I said. Only flaw I found on this model is that it uses too much grey (for me at least). It&#39;s mostly because ball joints are produced only in light/dark grey, but still, it could have looked much better if it used for example dark tan bricks instead. Apart from this little flaw, its painting&nbsp;is done greatly. It uses many not so typical colors, like dark&nbsp;tan, dark brown etc.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Beside interesting colors, there are also some extremely useful bricks. There is a lot of curved bricks, especially worthy are cut 1x2. Also very useful is 1x2&nbsp;slope with tile (<a href=""https://rebrickable.com/parts/28192/slope-45-2-x-1-with-23-inverted-cutout-and-no-stud/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab."">28192</a>) and new 1x1 bracket.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>It&#39;s a great set, with useful parts. Very few flaws, many pros. Presents itself really majestical. Worth its price (~$4.5).</p>
