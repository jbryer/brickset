<p>Most of the values in the set are minifigure&nbsp;and stickers, the rest are just basic bricks. We got a vehicle that is not size compatible with the minifigure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The play value&nbsp;is low, you can&#39;t do anything with the minifigure, don&#39;t have equipment, not even an fire ax. The car can only roll, that&#39;s all.</p>

<p>In 1978, most sets were fire-themed, more so than police sets, today the exact opposite.&nbsp;Instead of the 5 undeveloped firefighting sets, I would have rather done three, but it would be fully minifigure compatible.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I would have discarded this set and the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/620-1/Fire-Truck"" target=""_blank"">620</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;And the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/672-1/Fire-Engine-and-Trailer"" target=""_blank"">672/556 set</a> should have been made minifigure compatible.</p>

<p><strong>A <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/640-2/Fire-Truck-and-Trailer"" target=""_blank"">640 set</a> would be better for a fire chief set.</strong></p>
