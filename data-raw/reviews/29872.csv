I had never owned any former editions&nbsp;of these types of minifig&nbsp;history books. It was nice reading through the pages and seeing how minifigs have evolved over time and learning fun and interesting facts about them. For me, this is a great coffee table book;&nbsp;just have it out so that people can browse at their leisure. While the contents (reading material plus minifig) are great, my one downside is the price.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience: 1/5 (really should be&nbsp;N/A) -</strong> There&#39;s nothing to build, the minifig&nbsp;that comes with the book is pre-built.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts: 5/5 -</strong> There is an exclusive Orange Classic Space minifig&nbsp;that comes with the book. The torso and helmet pieces are exclusive while the legs, head, and arms you can find very easily.&nbsp;If you&#39;re a fan of the Classic Space, you&#39;ll love this.</p>

<p><strong>Playability: 5/5 -</strong> It&#39;s a book - you read it. The minifig&nbsp;of course has the playability of any other minifig.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value for money: 3/5 </strong>- The regular retail price is $40 (USD), which to me is a bit steep/pricey. I managed to snag this off Amazon for 30% off.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Other thoughts:</strong> My overall score was influenced by having never owned one of these types of books before. I can&#39;t compare this version vs. a previous one to see how much is repeated vs. new. As a new addition for me, it&#39;s great. If you&#39;ve owned a prior edition, I think you should do some more research to see how much is new vs. spending ~$40 on this.&nbsp; The book was&nbsp;thicker than I anticipated, but it&#39;s deceiving; about half of it is &#39;packaging&#39; for the minifig and the rest is the book itself.&nbsp;</p>

"Mr__Thrawn","2021-01-07T21:17:35.287Z","Great Minifigure, Great Information","<p><em>LEGO Minifigure: A Visual History&nbsp;</em>was first released in 2013, including three (pre-existing)&nbsp;minifigures and around 250 pages of information. In 2020, LEGO and DK released an updated version featuring closer to 300 pages, and including a brand new minifigure. The new book features an updated black cover, dominated by the new orange spaceman. The content is mostly the same as the 2013 version, all the photographs and text about figures produced from 1978-2013 is entirely identical. The new information is of the same quality, spotlighting interesting and groundbreaking figures from recent years, and adding a few new segments about interesting parts throughout minifigure history. I will note, however, that the (very few) blurry photographs and typos from the first book are brought over to this edition. Beyond that, though, it&#39;s all very effectively and cleanly presented.</p>

<p>The minifigure is of the generally expected high quality. The minimal print is sharp and clean, and the new orange helmet and air tanks are consistently coloured with the rest of the parts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;d say that this book is a must-have for anyone who doesn&#39;t have the original. Its image quality is excellent, and it&#39;s cool to see the evolution of the minifigure throughout the years. If you already have the first book, I&#39;d recommend this one if you want the classic spaceman, or if you really want the updated information.</p>

The minifigure that comes with the book is why I originally bought it. It is a Orange Spaceman that is inspired by the first minifigure in&nbsp;history, the minifigure from classic space. Overall, a great book!</p>
