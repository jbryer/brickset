When I signed up for this build, the clerk at the LEGO store told me it was for ages 16+, which made sense since it was meant to be a tie-in with the release of the Creator Expert Bookshop (10270).&nbsp; As such, I signed myself up for it, but did not sign up my children who are younger than 16.&nbsp; When I arrived for the build, however, I saw that the instructions indicated that it was ages 6+ and that the clerk had been mistaken.&nbsp; The building techniques required in this build were all very simple stud-on-top techniques so the 6+ age recommendation is appropriate.&nbsp; Though I did see a few kids struggling at the store while I was doing my build.&nbsp; Overall it was a satisfying build.</p>

<p><b>Parts</b><br />
The color scheme of this set is wonderful.&nbsp; The parts included in this set are pretty standard.&nbsp; The only really stand-out element provided was the tan 2x2 tile with the newspaper print on it.&nbsp; This element has previously only appeared in the following three relatively high-price sets, so its inclusion at this price-point is very welcome.</p>

<ul>
	<li>75827 - [Ghostbusters] Firehouse Headquarters ($349.99)</li>
	<li>70840 - Welcome to Apocalypseburg! ($299.99)</li>
	<li>10259 - Winter Village Station ($79.99)</li>
</ul>

<p>That being said, I anticipate this print being reused a lot in the coming years so its novelty will likely wear off with time.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong><br />
The set doesn&#39;t have too many play features.&nbsp; The refrigerator holding the soda cans doesn&#39;t open so you can&#39;t access the drinks.&nbsp; In fact, the only moving part is the door.&nbsp; Though the roof can be moved aside for easy minifigure placement.&nbsp; The other downside to the set as far as playability is concerned is that the tiles that represent the newspapers and candy bars (or are they magazines?) are constantly falling out behind the counter and because it is such a tight space it is difficult to retrieve them without disrupting all of the tiles and then having to put them all back into place.&nbsp; I actually have come up with a way to rectify this and will address that below in a section on how I intend to modify this set.</p>

<p>I actually think that this set is intended more to be a model for a city setup than a playset.&nbsp; Assuming your sidewalk is about 13 studs wide (6 studs from the road plate plus ~7 studs from the sidewalk of your modular building) the newsstand doesn&#39;t take up too much sidewalk space since it is only 6 studs deep.&nbsp; It&#39;s a perfect addition to a city scene.</p>

<p><b>Value for Money</b><br />
This set was an amazing value.&nbsp; It was a free Make-and-Take build at my local LEGO Store.&nbsp; It has 155 pieces and a minifigure, which would put it in the $19.99 range if it were actually for retail sale.&nbsp; That&#39;s an amazing deal!&nbsp; Most of the prior Make-and-Take builds have had a piece count that would put them in the polybag or $9.99 range, but this was a substantial and lovely gift to receive from LEGO.</p>

<p><strong>How I Intend to Modify This Set</strong><br />
I didn&#39;t like that the set included a 1x1 light bluish gray tile with a calculator print instead of a 1x2 light bluish gray 45 slope with a cash register pattern.&nbsp; I also found that the use of 1x1 corner panels for the ends newspaper/candy rack prevented the use of the full six-stud width of the space for merchandise which is why they tend to be so loose.&nbsp; There is no need for corner panels since there are bricks on either side of the rack to keep things in place.&nbsp; I plan on getting rid of the corner panels and replacing them with 1x2 panels&nbsp; I&#39;m also going to have the cash register sit above the top row of the the rack.</p>

<p>Another thing I didn&#39;t like about this set was the use of a transparent clear door.&nbsp; I plan on replacing it with a light bluish gray door.</p>

<p><strong>Overall </strong><strong>Thoughts</strong><br />
This is a great set to add to a city scene and while it may have a few flaws they are really rather minor.&nbsp; The parts aren&#39;t too obscure so you can probably piece it together from your own parts collection if you missed the build.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p>
