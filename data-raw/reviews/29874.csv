<p>My toddler lovvvvves it, but is a bit young to figure out how to use the screwdrivers. As an adult, it makes playtime a lot more fun and interesting.</p>

<p>I found it on sale online&nbsp;for ~$80 at Discount School Supplies. Amazing price for a set this big and the tech that goes into it.&nbsp;</p>
