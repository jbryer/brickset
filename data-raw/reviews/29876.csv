"xboxtravis7992","2020-02-22T15:47:20.037Z","International Space Station","<p>In 2003, I got several sets from the short-lived&nbsp;<em>Lego Discovery&nbsp;</em>theme. Branded for the Discovery Channel, all these sets focused on space exploration. One of them, was&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7467-1/International-Space-Station"">7467-1 International Space Station</a>, Lego&#39;s first attempt at capturing the International Space Station. I got it as a kid, and built it along with the Mars set focused on Spirit and Curiosity.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The 2003 space station set... was terrible. It was a gangly thing, that felt half finished... because it depicted the space station&nbsp;<em>half finished</em>, only a few parts of the Russian segment and the American segments had been launched and assembled as of 2003, with a single truss segment in an upright position. The included shuttle Atlantis incorrectly docked with the station model via its belly on the side of the American segment. The whole model was covered in unsightly stickers and sat gingerly on two single Technic axles; the thing fell to pieces in my Lego bin and I never got the desire to rebuild it.</p>

<p>When the opportunity came up for a new International Space Station on Lego Ideas, I was intrigued to say the least. By 2020, the International Space Station itself was a completely different beast than the station had been in 2003 when Lego produced the first set; now the station was nearly complete, and had been established as a permanent low earth orbit habitation. It had been home to countless scientific studies, represented the completion of the American vision of &quot;Space Station Freedom&quot; melded with the former Soviet vision of &quot;Mir 2,&quot; it&#39;s commercial supply vehicles paved the way for the spectacular rise of commercial space travel particularly SpaceX and their Dragon series of craft... and the station was where the&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo"">first music video in space</a>&nbsp;was filmed. 2003&#39;s Lego set was that of a half finished station in a half-baked set... then the 2020 set had the chance to be a fully realized station using all the best tricks and techniques Lego has developed in the 17 years since their last crack at it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>There are about six bags of in the set, which comes in a&nbsp;nice Lego Ideas box opening box; the first bag is dedicated to building several spaceships for the set, the second focuses on the display stand, and the remaining bags focus on the actual station with the final bag dedicated to the eight enormous solar panels along the central truss. Heavy mix of SNOT and Technic pieces are needed to get the shapes right and keep the module sturdy. I particularly liked the incorporation of the 10.2mm ball joints inside the trusses to allow the rotation of the solar panel arms... I had to test out how the station solar panel&#39;s looked like as cursed arms on some of my Bionicle sets thanks to that. Poor&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8904-1/Avak"">Avak</a>, those solar panels didn&#39;t suit his look at all...&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Three small microscale astronauts/cosmonauts are included to display in EVA on the station exterior.&nbsp;They use the same design as those from the Saturn V set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>

<p>This is a model of a real structure, and as such I feel it is important to judge the set against the real thing. Wikipedia has a great article showing the construction of the station and the individual modules which I am using as a reference for this&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_of_the_International_Space_Station"">on their assembly page for the ISS.</a>&nbsp;The Lego model seems to depict the most recent station arrangement as of the time of the set&#39;s release.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let&#39;s start off on the side facing the viewer on the display stand, the American segment. Harmony is the very first module built in the set, with the three Japanese&nbsp;lab components to the viewer&#39;s right. The external testing lab is well depicted with a small skeleton arm to represent a robot manipulator over a platform showing where the experiments are attached. At the front of Harmony is a black fez representing PMA-2, one of the docking ports on the station. Notably lacking though is PMA-3, which should be on top of Harmony, instead an inverted Lego stud is there... still allowing for docking of some&nbsp;included spaceships; but omitting the distinct conical shape of the PMA modules. To the viewer&#39;s left on the side of Harmony is the European Columbus lab.<br />
<br />
Working back, we find the USA&#39;s Destiny lab and Unity modules buried underneath the truss segments. This is pretty accurate, as the massive truss, which acts as a spine for the station does indeed obscure a large part of these modules on the real station. Jutting off to our left is the Quest airlock, represented with a soda can tile mounted to a cylindrical brick. To our right is several more modules, Tranquillity, Leondardo, the station&#39;s famous viewing window the&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cupola_(ISS_module)"">Cupola</a>, and the BEAM represented using Lego balloon pieces... appropriate since that module is an inflatable sphere in real life. On the bottom of Unity is a permanently attached&nbsp;cylindrical piece with solar panels, presumably representing a docked&nbsp;<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygnus_(spacecraft)"">Cygnus</a> cargo craft. I am actually not sure what module the Cygnus is docked to, the Leonardo used to be docked there, but it was moved to near the Tranquillity module and is already depicted on the Lego model as being visible there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The truss dominates much of the station, running the full length of the model. As previously mentioned, the arms are mounted on 10.2mm ball and socket systems, allowing the arms to rotate to adjust the solar panels to face the sun (or the lights in our display room). White panels jutting off represent the various heat radiators, and several golden lightsaber bars serving as a rail for Canadarm 2. Canadarm&nbsp;2 is one of the model&#39;s few &quot;play features&quot; capable of being posed as grabbing an incoming spacecraft to bring it in for docking; a real life practice used to grab SpaceX Dragon 1, Northrop Grumman Cygnus and other inbound cargo craft.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back on the crew modules, from Unity the set transfer&#39;s into the Russian Orbital Segment. First we find Rassvet&nbsp;docked on the bottom of the set, with a permanently attached Soyuz/Progress style spacecraft. The Soyuz and Progress are the workhorses of the ISS project, serving as the primary crew and cargo vehicles respectively. Zarya is the next module, followed by two Soyuz docked where Poisk and Pirs are supposed to be. This is one of my few complaints on the model, like the previously mentioned PMA-3; Poisk and Pirs aren&#39;t well represented as only cylindrical pieces to allow for the two docked Soyuz; when in reality they should be spherical modules about the size of the Soyuz&#39;s orbital module. Still the design Lego used here gives these Soyuz&#39;s an advantage over the one docked on Rassvet, they can be detached from the model and displayed separately. The Soyuz on Poisk is built in bag 1 for example, while the Soyuz with Pirs is built with the rest of the Russian segment to highlight the ability of these craft to dock and undock with the modules here. Finally, Zvezda caps the end of the model with an additional nadir docking port for one more Soyuz/Progress style ship to dock with the station.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>On The Subject of Scale</strong></p>

<p>In total, the model includes several spacecraft... the four Soyuz/Progress style craft, one Northrop Grumman Cygnus, a SpaceX Cargo Dragon, a single Space Shuttle and a lone capsule, presumably to represent either a SpaceX Dragon 2, a Boeing Starliner or perhaps a NASA Orion.This collection, is where the limits of micro-scale really come into play as&nbsp;<a href=""https://historicspacecraft.com/Diagrams/S/ISS_Visiting_Vehicles_1200x700_RK2019.jpg"">this diagram shows</a>&nbsp;when comparing all the real life vehicles in scale. While the Soyuz showcase their orbital modules and service module very well, the bullet shaped re-entry module is omitted from the craft. The Cargo Dragon, despite in real life being about the same size as the Dragon 2 and Starliner, is one of the smallest craft in the set; really only recognizable due to its shape. The Cygnus is absolutely huge, it should be much closer in diameter to the Cargo Dragon (a real life necessity as Cygnus normally launches on the smaller Antares rocket, while Dragon variants fly on the Falcon 9). The shuttle is slightly undersized, it should be a bit larger since it absolutely&nbsp;<a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/m6dM2.jpg"">dominated the scene</a>&nbsp;when docked to the real ISS.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Again though, I really don&#39;t know how much of this could have been avoided due to the particular limitations of building with Lego&nbsp;in such a small scale. The station itself is gorgeous and other than a few small omissions, it succeeds in capturing the correct shape and look of the station. I think some MOC&#39;ers will have a good time modifying the microships and station modules to their fancy, getting things a&nbsp;bit more accurate than the official set captures, while what Lego did provide in the box is close enough to represent the job for those who don&#39;t mind the small scale errors the ships cause.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Expandability</strong></p>

<p>Speaking of MOCs... the ISS is a craft that is not yet &quot;truly&quot; finished. The Russian Segment is still waiting for a few additional expansions, and I think Lego&#39;s set will make it easy for MOC builders to include those planned expansions if the real ones ever launch in real life. The Nauka lab is supposed to replace Pirs, and would easily dock into the Lego module in Pirs location where there is currently a Soyuz on the underbelly of the Russian Segment. Several other Russian science modules again are supposed to dock to Nauka, however delays in funding for Nauka&nbsp;have some doubting the Russians will ever launch it; but the Lego model definitely has the possibility of easily adding it if the real thing ever makes it to orbit.<br />
<br />
The next big expansion currently planned for the ISS is&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.axiomspace.com/axiom-station"">Axiom Station</a>, a commercial space station extension that will allow for a corporate research lab, habitation for space tourists, additional solar panels on a new vertical truss, and a second viewing Cupola with much larger windows. This will be a bit harder to incorporate in the Lego module, as Harmony has only one stud available at where PMA-2 is currently at. I am sure some rather ingenious Lego fans will be able to solve the challenge of successfully including the Axiom Station as an extension in their ISS set. Lastly, I wouldn&#39;t be surprised to see future MOCs&nbsp;to bring additional ships to the current microscale spaceship fleet, such as the commercial Dream Chaser, the Japanese HTV, the European ATV, the proposed Russian Orel, the commercial British based Skylon, and of course SpaceX&#39;s proposed and potentially revolutionary Starship, a massive stainless steel vessel that would dwarf most of the station&#39;s own modules!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>The fact I am ending this after talking about all the MOC possibilities should be telling how I feel about this set. Are there issues in the scaling and omission of some smaller modules? Yes. However, it doesn&#39;t ruin the fact this set is highly detailed, well shaped, and manages to capture its subject&nbsp;well. Even putting this next to the much larger Saturn V, the ISS holds its own as a display piece; its massive solar panel arms on the truss catch the eye and just look excellent on display. 2003&#39;s 7467-1? That can stay broken up in the part&#39;s bin for all I care... this new ISS is the definitive rendition of the station, and while not perfect it is teaming with opportunity for MOC building and extensions to keep it up to date with the latest developments of the station.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While I agree to an extent with the sentiment that sometimes it feels like Lego Ideas is overrun with NASA and space exploration sets... I think it is clear that there is a demand for more of these sets; especially if they continue the high quality that the ISS and Saturn V demonstrated. There is countless more possible rockets and spacecraft for Lego to someday touch... How about a take on the Falcon 9 or Falcon Heavy (red Tesla of course sitting in the cargo fairing)? The classic Soviet era R7 that is still flying in upgraded form as the modern Soyuz and Soyuz 2 rocket family? How about some love for the suborbital SpaceShipOne and SpaceShipTwo craft and their White Knight carriers? The possibilities are endless, and have the potential to create more high quality display vehicles and capture STEM history in Lego form.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At $70 USD the ISS is well worth its price of purchase. It sits proudly next to my Saturn V and a few of the spacemen from the Lego Movie sets... (definitely a ship for Benny to get excited about!) Now to save up for that Apollo lunar lander set to finish the collection...&nbsp;</p>

"REGINALDO","2020-04-22T20:40:22.02Z","The ISS in my hands","<p>The <strong>21321 International Space Station </strong>set is a classic from Lego. Truly magnificent, a relic for Lego worshipers and fans, and of course a set that depicts the International Space Station. And mainly, for fans of space, I mean, space stations, spaceships, among other space universe, set 21131 was excellent.</p>

<p>For me it was very emotional when I bought it, I got a glimpse, even at the age of 47, as a Lego fan, I say that the set has an indescribable feeling when you are assembling, in front of a miniature of such a huge and giant Space Station , the pleasure of assembling the set, and even placing it on your shelf or on my display, in a prominent place.</p>

<p>My score from 0 to 10, is 10000, congratulations to Lego for the opportunity to make available an adult and children&#39;s dream, to build their own space station, when I say their own, of course it is an international station, it is a copy of a model already existing, but that has a lot of importance for us humans.</p>

<p>There are many pieces, many details, an instruction manual with a lot of information, it is worth it, a relic, a story, that I will have for the rest of my life, and certainly take this inspiration for many generations.</p>

<p>Joining Lego with the passion for space is priceless, two passions in one model, the International Space Station built by Lego bricks, in my hands, made by my hands, and within reach of my hands, wonderful. Congratulations to Lego, Congratulations to the Builder of this magnificent idea, Congratulations.</p>

<p>And be sure to purchase yours, it is very worth it !!!</p>
