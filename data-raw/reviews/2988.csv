"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-07T17:30:40Z","Great!  For a little set.","First off, the wizard is a great fig.  He has a beard, a cape, and a hat.  Plus he holds a magic wand.
The accessories are great too.  It has a falcon, a sword, a scroll, and a cup.
The building is good, with big branch pieces.
The only thing that made this set lose a point is the fact that the wizard doesn't fit well in the shop.  Cya!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-04T13:21:22Z","Good addition to every castle set","I've bought it today on a meeting of the Bouwsteen. It is a bit used but it is a great set. The fig with beard is great. The brown 2*135 degrees pieces, the leaves and the falcon are good. The Spell and the Goblet also. I paid 6 Euro for it and maybe that it's a little bit expensive but it worth it. ( TLC, make this a legend.)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-13T19:33:41Z","My first castle set!","  This was my first castle set, I loved it.  There's no flaw with this set.  The hollow tree made a great hiding place for spells and treasure, and the falcon helps convey that 'dead forest' feel.  I especially loved the wizard with his wand and spell tile.  Since this is only a hiding place it didn't need to be too big.  I always put this in with other LEGO trees but it always stood out.  I did't have any bricks to make oak trees :)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-10-30T09:17:54.717Z","A bit of magic","I believe this is the smallest set with the wizard. So get it if you feel you must have him! You also get a magic wand, a sword, a brown barrel, and a gray bird. And the tree looks good the way it is. I doubt that it would look better if the tree were in brown. I think black is a good colour too. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-05-01T11:11:57.957Z","Abracadabra","This is a nice small little set with a wizard and his glow in the dark wand, a grey parrot, some barrels, a few flame pieces a ladder and a hollowed tree/bush.  The tree would have looked better in brown.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-22T18:40:51.543Z","Antoehr little with this classic wizard","When the fright knights have a witch, the dragon knights have a wizard, this with blue parts, and white beard. In this set he is too included, with a small shop. In these lines, he already came with a set of shop, but this is the littlest version. The stair is included to close the shop, and have also things like a barrel, and itens like a sword and the wizard's staff. It is in all useful, being in the version of the instructions or in many that can be builted. The dragon knights sets have many times this wizard, and is easy make creations with it. This is an useful and classic thing, many lego fans like it, this is only one of some sets that includes this awesome and simple minifigure. I rate this small shop 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MPH","2009-04-03T17:20:17.903Z","Not much of a shop...","I think this set looks more like a hollow tree where Majisto hides his treasure and other stuff, than that it should be called a 'shop'. But anyway, what's in a name? Otherwise this set is pretty cool. 

For a small set, this is actually quite big, with lots of useful pieces. It's a bit strange that the tree is brown while its branches are black, but it was probably the best choice color-wise. The design of the tree is nice, although the assymetric branches can look a bit weird from other angles than the one pictured here.

There are also many ""extra's"" like a magic spell, a magic wand, a glass, a sword, a barrel and a bird. And it's a cheap way to get a majisto minifig - although owning more dragon knight sets makes you wish this set had a regular knight instead...",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-11-19T22:14:04.78Z","Nothing Much","This is a nice little set, but has some flaws. I think the shop should be way bigger and maybe some wands and other things also. I also think that the tree should be brown instead of black. Besides that, this isn't that bad.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MEGADETH","2011-01-10T22:38:02.8Z","Perfect small set!","I bought this set back in 1994 and I still have it in a very condition. The structure looks great and somehow has a forestmen theme atmosphere, especially with its branch, ladder and small green plate. The minifig Merlin/Majisto looks wonderful, it includes white beard, blue wizard hat, hard black cape, a parrot, magic scroll and a glow in the dark wand. There's also some nice detail on this torso... a black belt and a medicine ( or magic powder ). I bought it for $6 back in the day but today some people are selling it at $19-$29 range. If you could get it new sealed, I think its a fair price since this set is more than 15 years old.<br><br>For those who like medieval / fantasy / castle theme, you cant go wrong with this one. :)<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"legoman4694","2008-05-20T19:52:07.11Z","nice selection","this et comes with a nice selection of pieces. you get a wizard, his glow in the dark wand, a scroll a falcon, and some brown &quot;tree&quot; pieces. there are good models on the back of the box and its a good cheap way to get the wizard. there is a ladder/cage which im not so sure what its for but the set is still cool. 10/10 ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-15T21:23:23.047Z","Magic Shop Review","<p>This set is part of the Dragon Knights sub-theme in Castle. The counter to the Fright Knights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a small set and makes or made for an easy way to get ahold of one of the early blue wizards featured in Lego Castle. The styling of the blue minifigure is much like the Peasant and Forestmen Leader minifigures with a belt and pouch on it, only it's blue instead of the grey or green with other the minifigures mentioned. He features a white beard and blue hat, something new for LEGO back then. He carries a wand and a scroll tile piece.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shop, which looks more like a hollowed out tree has a clear chalice and a couple of the transparant light pieces for gems. A ladder folds down to sort of act as a door or secure the place when the wizard isn't there. A pair of flames or torches are set to either side of the tree hollow. A barrel, sword and grey bird finish off the build.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not a bad little set and if you've been collecting the Dark Forest and Forestmen sets, this tree shop build goes nicely with the overall Castle sets and all of it's sub-themes.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"orybloodmyre","2010-09-02T14:17:30.13Z","Where lego first began with me- my first ever lego set!","<p>Well this is where it all began for me. This was the first lego set I ever got, that wasnt one of those boxes of bricks. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Testimony to how good this set must have&nbsp; been, I am still buying lego all these years later, even though by now I should have outgrown it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I dont remember putting this set together, as I must have been only about four or five when I got this set. However it was a firm favourite despite not lasting for very long. I dont think I recieved/bought any more lego sets of the same series untill a few years later when I recieved the dragon knights castle (i think its called) for my birthday. This set was long since lost/broken up by then, though the wizard figure&nbsp; did decide to upgrade his residence from this tree house thing to the castle. At the same time as getting this, I also got a lego ambulance, so the wizard was always taking trips to the hospital on all manner of wizarding related ailments.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am resisting the urges to put a bid on one of these sets on ebay despite the fond memories. Lego indy and star wars are far too expensive a series without me trying to buy every single lego set that was meaningful to me,&nbsp;even if this was the first set I ever had!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>pros:A wizard figure. Gandalf eat your heart&nbsp;out, this bad boys the new sorcerer in town.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; cool accessories, bird and sword.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cons: Like I could think&nbsp; of a bad thing about this set.</p>
