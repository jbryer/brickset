Highly collectible.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This packaging is a tad unusual honestly, there&rsquo;s a nice white box labelled with Disney Mickey Mouse &amp; Friends and then you see the Brickhead and an animation shot of Donald on the side flap, but then there&rsquo;s this pattern all around the box of different Mickey Mouse body parts, heads, hands, his torso and a foot or two. Is this implying that Donald really hates Mickey or something? Or is it an attempt to emulate Disney films, can you find all the hidden Mickeys? Or, maybe this was an attempt to hint at the Mickey and Minnie set being released much later in the year. Either way it&rsquo;s a highly unusual package design and I&rsquo;m not sure if I appreciate it as much as the others in the line.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Donald&rsquo;s Manual is folded in half and features a shot in the back of Goofy and Pluto who are also still currently available. The steps for the build are easy to follow along with, if a bit difficult since the manual likes to slam closed while you&rsquo;re working due to the way it was packaged.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Yellow, White, Blue and Black, Headlight Bricks and many others. Standard parts fare for BrickHeadz. Donald&rsquo;s torso is printed and unique 2x2 brick. It&rsquo;s one of only two printed elements aside from the eyes in the entire set. The other being the back of his suit&rsquo;s collar on a 1x4 brick.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Donald is a Duck, while the central skeleton of the BrickHead is fairly standard fair, when it comes time to constructing the head and other elements you will find some nice unique ideas. Making the bill is quite fun and a very nice use of existing parts from LEGO. The hat is also a fun build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Donald stands out as one of my all time favourite Disney characters, I love his attitude, his down-on-his-luck life, he&rsquo;s a very enjoyable character and as such I had to pick this up. The BrickHeadz is designed very well, with a tail and beak design that works very well at portraying the character. He also looks great next to Mickey on the shelf.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I highly recommend the set, while I was not a huge fan of the design for the box, I did find that the contents were very enjoyable. Loved the build, loved the finished model, really hope we see a Daisy, Huey, Louie and Dewey to go with him. Highly Recommended.</p>
