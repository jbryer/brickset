Decent enough GWP from LEGO.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #853990 Easter Bunny House:</b> It&rsquo;s another Seasonal GWP and it&rsquo;s a cute looking Minifigure with some cute little builds. This Easter Bunny is the third release of somebody dressed as a bunny, if I&rsquo;m not mistaken, and what began in the CMF series has continued as GWPs. For a GWP this set is very well done.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Similar to the Cave set I received a few years ago the packaging for this set is a cute looking design in an egg-shaped box. A Easter Egg is shown as a house for the Minifigure, an actual egg graphic, no brick models here, and the box shows off the models in the set which is very nice. A sleeve is included which needs to be removed carefully if you want to preserve it, there&rsquo;s also a tag on the top where you can put a name if giving this set away as a gift.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The included manual is a fold-out pamphlet style, similar to Classic LEGO Manual designs for small boxed sets in the 80s and 90s.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A small selection of parts for this set. Not a lot really since this is a GWP with some simple add-on builds to go with it. There&rsquo;s a printed egg tile, a teal blue scooter and a fe plant elements.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Easter Bunny: With plain white legs, a dual-sided torso showing off a cute looking light aqua jacket with big purple bow-tie some fuzzy bunny tail visible, this Minifigure looks cute and fun. She&rsquo;s wearing the bunny hood piece first seen with Series 7 CMF and has a carrot to carry with her. Her face has a very cute little buck-toothed smile with bunny whispers on the side. Overall a great looking Minifigure and quite different from past East Bunny like characters.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">You get to construct a small chicken coop, a piece of scenery, some additional parts for the back of the scooter and a carrot, not much really to discuss. It&rsquo;s an enjoyable enough build for a set of this size and quick so you can start playing with the set as soon as possible.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Chicken Coop: The mostly build up model in this set is a cute little chicken coop with slanted roof, very fun looking model and a pretty clever inclusion.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Scenery: Some added plant elements included to liven up the display.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Scooter: Not much to build here, but it&rsquo;s a fun bit of additional pieces to give the Minifigure a rear carrier for the eggs she&rsquo;s going to deliver. All of the eggs in this set use the simple knob end piece used for most large MECH hand finger tips in white, this is very clever as it allows the parts to slot into some rounded plates with holes to give the illusion of an egg carton.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a very clever and fun little set. Really was pleased to find it on store shelves. Would I recommend it? It&rsquo;s probably not for everybody, but I still found it highly enjoyable and a nice display piece, especially with the box. My only real gripe is that in order to open this set you almost have to destroy the fun box. Recommended.</p>
