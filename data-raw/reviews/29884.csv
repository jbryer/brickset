<p>The nice things about the box are that it&#39;s a giant minifigure head and is pretty spacious inside. The lid is hollow as well, allowing the contents to pile up a bit inside. If you own multiple of these heads, their studs allow them to stack as well.</p>

<p>There are two things I don&#39;t like about the design. The choice of the modern equivalent to the classic smiley makes sense but doesn&#39;t work for me. The face isn&#39;t very appealing as a giant disembodied head and doesn&#39;t have the charm of the old face. I blacked out the white dots and rubbed off the eyebrows to get it pretty close to the classic look so I would enjoy looking at the box more. The other flaw with the box is that its lid fits nicely, but I really would have preferred some kind&nbsp;of screw cap or twist-lock feature to ensure the lid stayed on tight. The shape of the box is highly unlikely to tip over, but if it was knocked off a table or shelf, there&#39;s a big spill waiting.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a set and there&#39;s not much to say about it. It&#39;s a cute design and offers good storage, but falls a bit short of maximum practicality and appeal. I might get the large skull for my minifigure parts and the small pumpkin for whatever else, though. They&#39;re pretty neat pieces.</p>
