"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-20T17:32:06Z","Extra knights + round shields","This set comes with two nice knight minifigures as well as some of the rare round shields (nice since they have no heraldry, give them to whomever).  The weapon rack is not bad either, it can easily be added to the baseplate of another castle set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-04-03T07:05:26.247Z","Horsemeat","This set is a great set for parts.  For such a small set, there are 2 horses, 2 minifigs, saddles, flags and 4 lances.  As a set though, little to no thought seems to have gone into the set in terms of design, but that doesn't really matter in a parts set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-09T10:35:01.95Z","Another small joust","This is another of the many jousts of the lego sets. This includes one lion knight and one black falcon, each with their own symbols. These have little differences, being the detail above the helmet, printed armors in body, colors and symbols. Also the horses have little differences, only the color, because the both can carry swords. In this set hve four spears of jousts, only two of these have flags, the other two are in a small part made with normal and claw pieces to hang the joust spears and two shields in circular shape. Don't have much difference with other joust sets, but is smaller because don't have buildings or a king watching the joust. Altough small and have few differences, this set is an army builder, of two armies, lion knights and black falcons, and the four spears makes the weaponry for the armies. The horses are too useful, to many themes like western or castle. The playability is basically makes the knights rides the horses and make they beats one with the other. If with more sets this can be turned in a bigger joust or be addition to armies. To a small joust, this deserves 5/5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2011-10-26T08:00:45.23Z","Sir Richard & The Black Knight","Well that was the title that it had in a UK catalogue.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><ul><li>Black Falcon Knight: Black britches with red belt, silver armoured red torso with black arms, grey helmet, blue plume, sword, black falcon shield with yellow edge, brown lance and blue flag.</li><li>Lion Knight: Black britches with red belt, silver armoured blue torso with red arms, grey helmet with red plume, sword, blue lion shield, brown lance and red flag.</li></ul></div><div><b>Joust</b></div><div>This small set features the silver armour print torsos that seem the best bricks of the set and a great part from the old Castle range. There is a blue with red arms and a red with black arms. The accessories are as usual excellent and worthy of the theme.</div><div><br></div><div>As a kid you could interpret that these are Lion and Black Falcon (I thought they were 'Ravens') leaders or kings but the castles already came with a set of similar knights so are these extras worthwhile? I would suggest that they are for a simple lance stand and the fact that they are a slight variant and certainly bolster the local castle population. The castles were in fact large enough to fit in many extra people, horses and carts and a jousting tournament would look great outside.</div><div><br></div><div>A proper tournament set was made in the past and future of this release and they look filled out and complete with tent, arena and spectators (see the new 2012 exclusive joust set 10223-1) so comparatively this seems more a grudge match/ nemesis duel between 2 knights minus the crowd and setting.</div><div><br></div><div>Nonetheless the knights are excellent and with limited colours are an excellent part of a castle collection. Interchangeable knight pieces from the whole long castle range mean that everyone can design their own individual knight characters, if Lego could bring the individualism of the Heroica/ fantasy character ethos into the Castle theme, a broader game could be played with Castle, designing your own character and entire armies from accessory sets?</div><div><br></div><div>The build is brief but satisfying. Acccessories mentioned under minifigures covers what they hold in the instructions but the small stand also holds two spare brown lances and two castletastic circular shields. These could be for on foot combat.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Lance Alot</b></div><div>To summarise, set 6021 could be hard to find intact including unworn silver torso prints but could be built over time collecting the parts. A very likeable, low profile unit that delivers two strong characters of old Castle sets.</div><div><br></div><div>Charge!</div>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,3
"Ernst","2012-01-05T17:03:54.993Z","Jousting Knights; basic but as it should be.","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks:</strong> I see this set as very good, not a &quot;builders&quot; set but a set&nbsp;for collectors or just&nbsp;to play with. This is the joust as it should be : the two&nbsp;best fighters&nbsp;of the Lion Knights and the Falcon Knights in a man to man battle.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building&nbsp;2 bricks:</strong> simply because there is no real building involved here, just the assembling of 2 minifigures on horses and the 2 extra weapon racks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks: </strong>simply because for a man to man fight all is there. Both a sword, shield and a lance with on the rack a spare lance and in case of emergency a neutral shield which I consider a nice detail. Some people consider this as a great set for parts but I think it is a shame to see it that way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks:</strong> it speaks for itself when you look at the set. You can very well play with it separately&nbsp;and of course&nbsp;also&nbsp;combined with all your other (older) Castle sets, very good.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value 4 bricks:</strong> Looking at the original retail price (in euro&#39;s 4,10)&nbsp;it should have been 5, but for a complete set Bricklink offers at this moment an average of &euro; 14,30 for this 37 piece set. Not cheap but if still complete probably worth because it is already 28 years old and I presume small old sets like this keep their or will increase in value.</p>
