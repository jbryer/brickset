It comes with two good infantry models, the cart itself looks designed for defense, and they were nice enough to include a saddle so you can detach the horse and ride it off to battle.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-04-03T07:07:32.68Z","Back heavy","This is one of the earlier chariots and it is a bit disappointing.  Unlike the 6010 chariot though, the balance on this one isn't quite right with the effect that the rear of the chariot is always going down, pushing up the front part of the chariot where the rider is.  That is a design flaw that really could be avoided had the creators actually play tested the design.

Looks wise it's nice - the black and red colour scheme goes nicely and the 2 flags adds a nice touch to the set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-10-08T08:22:53.827Z","No balance","The balance of this chariot is really bad. It often happens that the back part of it - where the blue saddle hangs - goes downwards. The same happens to the snout of the horse. It also goes downwards so that you have a chariot and a horse that form some sort of triangle. This bad balance annoys me so tremendously that I took away 2 points from the full rating.

However, it also has some got things. You get two minifigs and a black horse plus a saddle. What I like most is that this little set comes with so many weapons. I also like those grey round shields and in this set you find one of these rare means of protection used by some medieval LEGO soldiers. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-09T10:50:24.56Z","Great for a small cart","I am reviewing this set in comparision with small sets, due to it be one, with or without innovations or big size. This is from the subtheme of the lion knights, and have two of these in the set, with little differences, like the shape of the helmets or the weapons, one with sword and other with a longbow. This is like many other castle little sets, a cart. This have a horse connected by red pieces(these pieces are more common in blue color, but still useful in the red)to the cart. It have also little additions, like the common flags and spears, and an axe, these weapons can be replace the weapons of the knights. These were putted in useful pieces, later used in ufo, altough is above the wheels, the cart can run well with these black pieces. Have also a piece in the back of the cart that can makes the horse carries a sword and another weapons in the same time that the minifigure rides it. The cart can also carries another things in it's back, like the shield in circular shape. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Freezdried","2010-01-28T11:31:59.623Z","Lots of play value for a little set","When I got this set, I was madly collecting every Castle set I could find.  I had the two castles that came out that year, and I wanted more stuff to go with them.  So I got this horse cart.  It was a bargain set, no matter how you look at it.  Two mini-figs, a horse that you can attach to a cart or put a saddle on, and weapons galore!  It was a great way to increase my army for the battles I would create.  As a kid, it added to the play value of my other sets.

Now, as an adult, when I consider the value of this set, I find it lacking in many ways.  The balance is off, so unless you plug the horse into a base-plate, its hind legs come up off the ground.  That is, unless the connection between the horse hitch and the turntable is tight.  Maybe it was tight when the set was new.  But after 20+ years, the joint has become really loose and floppy.  Still, the set was playable at the time.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-15T21:36:42.983Z","Horse Cart Review","<p>It's not a bad set over all, it reminds me a bit of 6010 Supply Wagon and 6016 Knight's Arsenal sets... only instead of one minifigure, you get two.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Balance wise, the set isn't very good as the cart tends to fold up from the weight and design of the bricks in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, the horse has a saddle so he can be ridden and there's plenty of weapons for helping&nbsp;to field and build an army. It's one of those sets in retrospect when I look back, there were a lot of Castle Catapults and Wagons with many of them having better builds and designs then others. This one is on the side of mediocre for a set like it.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,3
