"Novelty","2007-04-03T09:21:17.86Z","Your Royal Highness","This set is probably the smallest Castle set with a female (until the appearance of the white ninja... but that's another debate altogether).  The cart is well designed with the usual black and red colours but its centre of gravity is slightly off balanced from the wheels so it's a bit awkward when it &quot;runs&quot;.  The canopy/roof and flags also adds to the awkwardness when the cart is in motion, but it adds charm to the set.  The nice bit at the end for the chest is an interesting touch and the seat for the soldier/chariotier in front of the princess/maiden is also good.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-12-08T07:06:13.497Z","The princess' taxi","This set is very simply in style, but it is a way of getting the maiden. I don't think that you can find her in many sets. You also get one when you purchase the King's Mountain Fortress (6081)or the Guarded Inn 6067/10000, for instance. The princess is the only good thing about this set.

What you get is the princess' bodyguard who comes without a shiled. The only weapon in this set is his spear. There is a treasure chest, which is nice, but it is empty. There is nothing in this set you can put in it. No gold or anything else. And the red roof is always falling off when you want to push it backwards to get the princess out. The red animal horse hitching with hinge is connected with a turntable with hinge. The turntable is built in in such a way that the turntable cannot move right and left. It's only there to fix the animal horse hitching. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-09T11:06:41.903Z","A small cart","Another small cart from castle, this is from the lion knights subtheme because have one of this army. Another cart with a horse, connected with the red pieces, later common in blue color. The cart is little, but rides well, and have the traditional castle's wheels. A simple piece is putted in the horse with the connection piece, but can be replaced by a knight(is good put a knight in the horse if it isn't connected with a cart). The another minifigure is of a maiden, made with the same face of original lego, same of the knights, but still considerable for one. This have a hat and different details. The red pieces in the sides and above the cart are useful to carts, chariots, wagons and many other vehicles of castle theme. This set used these as protection for the maiden on the cart. Is the maiden that is in the cart, but she isn't riding it. The knight, that is hanging a spear, can do that if the set turns bigger. Is easy to make creations with the contents of the set. For a small set, this is good due to the useful and playable things.    ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-01-13T04:53:21.49Z","Will Thoust Get The Maiden? ","There are not too many positive comments on this set and while reasonably understandable, there are some high positives that in my opinion, balance this toward a worthwhile set.&nbsp;For sure the silly maiden has a tiny cart, only one guard and a four horse wagon design would have suited her better with a full treasure chest and a few guards but it matters not.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4></div><div><ul><li>Royal princess hat.</li><li>Crossed axe badge.</li></ul></div><div>This badge for the guard always looks good with sensible grey 'armoured' britches for a change rather than the endless bright coloured and less armoured knights. This set at least gets you a princess for the castle despite the naf town beads and necklace torso. The princess' white hat is a prize piece.</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Jailbait</b></div><div>So its not safe to transport the filly any further than around the castle but at least there is a treasure chest even if it can fall off the back of the wagon. The main wagon's black shaft is the strange raised section brick that offsets upwards from a two stud wide plate. One review mentioned a turntable piece not working. I thought it enabled the horse shafts to swing left and right in a kind of steering pivot.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Another review said that the flags were white in their set, with this I also found a colour change to white banners which I thought preferable.&nbsp;The canopy is not the best hinged join as the brick is used backwards I think but it works ok. The aerial piece banner poles actually work really well to hold the banners through headlight/socket one stud blocks and it gives the best encompassing form to the tiny cart design.</div><div><br></div><div>Showing off bling and a treasure chest is surely asking to be robbed with only one guard but the character and cart brought a new dimension to the Castle theme so it should gain some points for this. The white horse and cart wheels are always a welcome addition, the horse colour seeming suitable with other white components.</div><div><br></div><div>Not the best cart by a long way. If it were not for the uniqueness at its release, white component colour scheme&nbsp;and simple but useful idea as a model, they could have just coloured it pink for total silly princess soppiness but this review ends promoting it as a decent set.</div>",TRUE,4,3,2,4,2
"Steamus","2011-04-02T16:52:24.02Z","White ""flags""","<p>In my set the ""flags"" covering the maiden on the sides are white, not red. I'm pretty sure they are original pieces that came with the set. Is my set unique? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not too impressed with the design of this set. The canopy easily breaks when opened&nbsp;and the weight balance between cart and horse is far from perfect. The charioteer isn't very well equipped, but I like the grey legs for some reason. The big plus with this set is the maiden,&nbsp;but the detailing of her upper body is really poor and the print is blurry.</p>",TRUE,2,2,2,2,2
"Ernst","2011-08-14T18:56:41.557Z","Maiden's Cart, the name of the set chosen well.","<p>The second time (after set 383) a Lady enters the Castle scene. A nice litlle set with some funny aspects or flaws. It is not bad bud not the best set either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building is simple but fun, parts connect well so three bricks here for an average building experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have some comments or questionmarks concerning the parts. Why add a small turntable when nothing turns, very strange but maybe to give you the oppurtunity to built it otherwise. The red side-flags are ok but why not flags with a sign on it ? The third comment concerns the treasurebox, I bought it secondhand so I even checked it on Bricklink to be sure. Where is the content of the treasurebox ?!? Two small yellow bricks, or a glass or yellow cup would have made the difference. A good thing is the way the roof can move with the 2 hinges and the 2 minifigures are ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set is well for playability because a Lady in distress is always welcome in a Knight's Tale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money is 3 bricks. Bricklink offers an average of a small €12,00 for this set, a good price I think. I payed €2,00 less so for me ok, overall for the going&nbsp;price a nice addition to your Castle sets.</p>",TRUE,3,2,3,4,3
"stephencr","2014-03-14T00:58:05.537Z","Adding some variety to the medieval scene","<p>I was inspired to buy this by the TV ad of the time, where the maiden in her carriage races into the castle and shouts &quot;off with their heads&quot;, followed by the popping off of a few Lego figures&rsquo; heads. At the age of 5 or 6 that was brilliant! I&#39;ve tried looking for that ad on YouTube but no luck.</p>

<p>It was the only Castle set I had for a long time and the horse, coupling, wheels,&nbsp;soldier, treasure chest and princess hat were unique for me at the time and very valuable.&nbsp;However it didn&#39;t really fit well into my Lego town and so it disappeared into my Lego box and the instructions lost and clips on the flags broken.</p>

<p>I often tried to rebuild it from memory but I couldn&#39;t work out how the turn table and horse coupling could turn left and right&nbsp;and still resemble the picture. Fast forward 20 years and Peeron explained that the coupling is fixed.</p>

<p>Anyway, the maiden is accompanied by a single guard with a single spear.&nbsp;A few reviewers comment that it&#39;s not much protection, but of course your other knights form an escort or entourage for her.</p>

<p>The design is attractive and from a certain angle quite realistic. Had&nbsp;mine remained in one piece into the 1990&#39;s it would have been used to recreate that scene in <em><span style=""font-family: &quot;Helvetica&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;;"">Robin Hood Prince of Thieves</span></em> where&nbsp;the merry men ambush the cart and&nbsp;the driver is dragged off by his horses, leaving Robin&nbsp;to steel the maiden&#39;s ring and gold. A lost opportunity for her, but for record I actually used 6042 to do that.</p>

<p>As others have mentioned, this set,&nbsp;along with the Guarded Inn and the Blacksmith,&nbsp;made up the few&nbsp;&#39;civilian&#39; sets in the castle theme, which&nbsp;looking back is&nbsp;a shame. When putting a number of the modular castle sets together what you form is more of a garrison or outpost rather than a true castle, but I suppose it was only aimed at kids then, how much fun would a stable or an apothecary have&nbsp;been?</p>

<p>All in all a great little set which adds a bit of variety&nbsp;in among all the medieval war mongering.</p>
