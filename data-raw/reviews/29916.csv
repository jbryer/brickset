The Classic series is also a great source of bricks to obtain, because the price per piece is usually low here. The 11011 set is a great example of this approach. Bricks and Animals is a powerful set containing 1500 items. The variety of elements is very large, both when it comes to shapes and colours. Inside the box you will find as many as 39 different shades. The popular brick 1x2 (design 3004) is available in 21 colours! There aren&#39;t too many large, double-row bricks here, which are good for young Lego fans, but rather not useful when building varied and detailed structures. There are many more small bricks here. The selection was very successful in this case.</p>
