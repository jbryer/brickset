<p>Long time fan of the site, first time reviewer.</p>

<p>And I have to say; what a fun little set!</p>

<p>In terms of value, I think this is fantastic value for money - Like the rest of the world, I know nothing about the narrative of the film that this set supports but if you&#39;re a fan of the MCU&nbsp;then I think that&nbsp;you get a superb Black Widow playset&nbsp;with lots of replay value.</p>

<p>The figures.</p>

<p>I think you get three really detailed figures here.</p>

<p>It would have been nice to see Black Widow get some arm printing for her gauntlets but otherwise you get a nicely detailed figure here with her escrima sticks ready to tackle Taskmaster!</p>

<p>I think the Taskmaster figure is again a great marvel addition to its range of minifigs, according to Wiki he&#39;s able to mimic anybodies fighting style, so he should certainly be a challenge for BW!</p>

<p>The final figure is Yelena Belova, another Red Room graduate we&#39;re led to believe, who comes with twin guns and wearing a similar costume to Widows Infinity War costume but in white.</p>

<p>Both women have dual faces for Angry and normal whilst Taskmaster has a brilliant Skull print with a heads up display seemingly built in.</p>

<p>The Vehicles.</p>

<p>First up we have a blue Motorbike, it&#39;s nothing we haven&#39;t seen before but I appreciate the vehicles inclusion and I think they&#39;ve done a good job with the sticker print too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>And now onto the big build, we have here a Lego rendition of a Chinook.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed putting this together, it&#39;s a simple build but it has some fun elements to the build - especially the rotor blade engines. I appreciate that Lego hasn&#39;t relied too heavily on stickers for this one and the ones that are there really sell the idea of this being a military helicopter.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It has a really nice profile, once built, and in terms of play value I think it ticks all the boxes.</p>

<p>With four forward firing stud shooters nicely built into the helicopters side pods for air to surface attack and then two clipped in shotguns it&#39;s a really substantial play set.</p>

<p>An easy-to-access cockpit with plenty of space that then has a nice entry into the cargo bay. I can imagine anyone playing with this will love that they can fill this space up with minifigs, cargo (indeed it comes with one crate of loot) or&nbsp;accessories in transit.</p>

<p>This then leads to the rear cargo hatch which works really well. Closed it keeps the Chinooks profile fantastically, open it has plenty of space for minifig egress and space for the final build.</p>

<p>The final build is a small quad bike built from very little parts. However, I really don&#39;t think this is a criticism here as this adds even more to the playability of the set and with the motorbike you can have a fun little ground battle before fleeing back to the helicopter. Once back to the helicopter this quad bike tucks nicely into the rear of the craft for evacuating to fight another day.</p>

<p>This dates the review, but whilst the world is in lockdown this has entertained me sitting on the edge of my desk and i&#39;d recommend this for anyone to pick up - especially at this price point, as its affordable and with a lot going on in such a small set. I&#39;m more of a DC fan and I picked this up purely for the Chinook but the set as a whole has certainly won me over.</p>
