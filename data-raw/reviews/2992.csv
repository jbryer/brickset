"Novelty","2007-03-31T08:28:08.193Z","Forest gets darker","Lego got darker after the forestmen were released, and when the forestmen were updated, they got fused with the wolfpack to give rise to the dark forest.

There is nothing exceptional about this set - the working catapult is perhaps the only feature of note.  The design is rather odd, with bits sticking out of the BURP.  The treasure chest, complete with the gems, seems only to be thrown in as a last minute thought, although it does fit into the cavity at the foot of the BURP and can be enclosed with the ladder.  The only plus in this set is that the trees finally has brown trunks.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-23T15:03:25.53Z","Ambush on the forest","This is one set from the subtheme of the dark forest. This isn't very big or very small, and needs a comparision with sets in this size. The Dark Forest subtheme is from the old castle theme(The new is limited in environment, story and armies), and another subtheme of forests was released, this had minifigures that likes archers, and this have others that looks like be from the wolfpack subtheme due to the hat and their own symbol and shield. Have builting involved on this set, and this is easy. When the set is builted, is easy to play with and mix with other sets, one example is the catapult, very used on previous set. With three or four small sets and this, is easy make a building with catapults.  The building on the set is fixed above a green plate. A tower piece is located at one side of the catapult, in this, is putted the pieces to keep the tree, made with curve brown pieces and plant pieces as leafs that were used previously on very sets. The tree is in the front of the catapult, but this still shooting well the pile like pieces. A black plate is included and with claw pieces a stair piece can be moved to make a jail. In two sides, curve gray pieces are putted, where are placed weapons like a spear and an axe. Another itens are the crossbow piece, the shield, the hats, the treasure chest and a sword. This is an useful set, and good to play with. The useful pieces are the features, like the catapult and the stair piece to make a jail. If you are searching now, this is in an expensive price, but the new castle don't have forest subthemes, is only castles, ships or chariots. This set deserves a 5/5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T16:07:05.503Z","Beware the Dark Forest","<p>Set 6024 Bandit Ambush: I'm reviewing a set now that I no longer own completely, I've been meaning to buy up all the pieces I need to complete it from the Lego Online Shop's Pick-A-Brink function. I did own this set for the longest time, but eventually sadly I lost most of the pieces. Now I only have the mini-figures, the accessories and one or two other odd pieces.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I still remember how much fun I had with this set back in the day and how much fun it was to play with. This set is part of the Dark Forest theme, it includes two Dark Forestmen (or as I called them, the Foresters.) a treasure chest with jeweled pieces, the Dark Forest shield and sword, a black spear, a bow&amp;arrow and an axe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building it takes less than a few minutes, but when it's done you have a wonderful little outpost on the edge of the Dark Forest designed to defend against intruders. Both mini-figures can protect the treasure with their weapons or the catapult on the side of the outpost. You can also hide the treasure inside if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As part of a Forestmen/Dark Forest collection it is ideal - you can put it anywhere and it will look great and in conjuction with other Castle sets it offers a different group of enemies for the knights to have to fight as opposed to the same old, same old. It's also a good source for black spears if you're the type who wants to have unique accessories, brown spears were a dime a dozen back in the day, the black ones were the real treasure. I wish I hadn't lost/discarded all of the pieces for it when I got rid of my large bucket full of loose Lego Bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I highly recomend this to Castle fans. Overall 5 out of 5.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"AETerry","2011-01-16T11:09:57.267Z","Bandit Ambush Review","<p>At first, I was very happy to see a revival of the Forestmen theme. The similiarity of the minifigures and the use of the Stag Shield as seen in this set. However the use of the hoods felt like they were mushing the Wolfpack theme in with them. So where the larger sets are concerned, I never picked up any.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for this small set, I did pick it up as it is a catapult for the Forestmen to utilize against other Castle armies such as Lion Knights, Dragons and Black Falcons. There is a use of brown elements for trees instead of the previous black, chest of gems, two minifigures and an assortment of weapons to arm them with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not a bad little set in all and adds dimensions of play to the Forestmen and Wolfpack depending on who you want to align them with.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,5

<h4>Pros</h4>
<ul><li>Pro 1 Feels like you get a lot for your money.<br></li><li>Pro 2 Not a lot of building sets like these in its price range. Usually in this price range you get a lot of carriages and catapults, but not a building.</li><li>Pro 3 The forest theme is pretty cool and interesting</li><li>Pro 4 Cool alternate buildings</li><li>Pro 5 The minifigs are cool looking<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul><li>Con 1 The overall design seems slightly ill conceived. <br></li><li>Con 2 Nothing much really, I don't see why you wont get this set when it was out<br></li><li>…</li></ul>
<p>Overall great choice, lots of pieces, large, broad building pieces, trees, a ladder, a treasure chest. I had a lot of fun back in the day playing with this set. It was such a great deal that I wish all the castle sets out these days under $10 was such a great deal as this<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,3,4,5
"Ernst","2011-06-23T18:33:31.32Z","Nice Bandits","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong> : &nbsp;this is a great little set, small but has almost everything you expect. The theme&#39;s Dark Forest / Forestmen are very good, just like this lovely set.</p>

<p><strong>Building 4 bricks</strong> :&nbsp;because allthough it is small and easy to build Lego shows on the instructions several ways to build it. The original plan normally detailed, the others are shown as picture on the last page. Very good !</p>

<p><strong>Parts 4 bricks</strong> : the parts are nice, one big brick and the rest small parts. Sufficient weapons for the 2 bandits and&nbsp;a treasurebox with stolen jewels.&nbsp;One thing I miss for the fifth brick here is&nbsp;an extra minifigure who will be their victim. That would have made it perfect.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 4 bricks</strong> : this&nbsp;is good because all is present to play with, good camouflage and&nbsp;even a small catapult. Like said before, another minifigure to rob would have made it perfect so borrow one from another set.</p>

<p><strong>Value 4 bricks</strong> : Average value is according to&nbsp;<span style=""display: none;"">&nbsp;</span><a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=6024-1"">Bricklink</a> &euro;11,50 which I estimate as good for this set. I paid a little less but missed the shield (got it already) so I paid the going price. Happy I bought it.</p>

"SirSven7","2012-02-16T03:04:38.24Z","Lego Steve's Review","<p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">The smallest set available would have fitted perfectly alongside
the Forestmen sets from the 80s. If viewed from the front this sets looks like
a rock with some twigs growing out of it, however turn it around we get this awesome
little hideout complete with catapult, chest and a completely unnecessary
ladder. <br></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""""><br></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style="""">I like the huge amount of weapons (though I would rather the spear be
brown not black, but hey you gotta get that ‘dark in there somewhere) and I
like the fact that for such a small number of bricks you can do a lot with the
set, My only real gripe is why include gems with the chest, yes I understand
that treasure in chest is something LEGO always do but it feels so out of place
here, why would outlaws living in the forest have gems? Overall its one of my
favourite smaller sets as it is so useful anywhere.</span></p><p class=""MsoNormal""><span style=""""><br></span></p><p class=""MsoNormal"">
