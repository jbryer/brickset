<p>This is a <em>GREAT SET</em>! I&#39;ve always looked at these mini-packs as offering questionable value-for-money as they tend to recycle past minifigures with unimpressive accessories. And minifigure packs always seem to have quite a high price (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70841-1/Benny-s-Space-Squad"" target=""_blank"">70841: Benny&#39;s Space Squad</a> being a delightful exception).</p>

<p>But this one offers some interesting figures, not one but TWO much sought-after after teddy-bears, and a genuinely playable mini-game in the shooting gallery.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>First off, the minifigures - two great shirts for the stallholders and a gorgeous unique unicorn shirt for the little girl (with matching face paint). The moustache and top hat are great fun and the Dad&#39;s hair is a nice piece only available so far in one other set (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60258-1/Tuning-Workshop"" target=""_blank"">60258: Tuning Workshop</a>).</p>

<h3>Parts and Accessories</h3>

<p>Then there are the accessories. The two <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6296075/mini-teddy-bear-no-14"" target=""_blank"">medium-blue bears</a> are a generous inclusion for LEGO; some might say it&#39;s a shame they&#39;re not two different colours, but production-wise it&#39;s much easier for them to put two the same in a set than have to include another different part, so no complaint there. This is really good value. This colour has appeared in the Build-a-Minifigure towers in LEGO stores, but so far hasn&#39;t appeared in any other set.</p>

<p>The decorative yellow printed tile is bright and appropriate - I&#39;d like more of these myself - and the three printed ring-pulls for the tops of the drink-can targets are (again) a surprising bit of generosity from LEGO. You could always replace these with ordinary grey caps and use the printed ones to give your minifigures a drink or stock a small shop. Finally, click on the &#39;Parts&#39; link above and just look at the four gold items you get too!</p>

<p>And then there&#39;s the fact that you can actually use the stud-shooter to play the shooting gallery yourself!</p>

<h3>Overall</h3>

<p>You can view this set either as an expansion of, or a pleasing low-cost alternative to, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60234-1/People-Pack-Fun-Fair"" target=""_blank"">60234: People Pack - Fun Fair</a>, and happily add it to any of LEGO&#39;s other <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/tag-Fairground"" target=""_blank"">funfair sets and rides</a>.</p>

<p>Well done LEGO. A useful and fun accessory pack, and it comes in an attractive minfigure-shaped blister-pack, which could even be painted or used as a mould or tray.</p>
