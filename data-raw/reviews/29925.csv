<p>Got this set as part of a Lego Shop@Home promo in March 2020, and was originally much more interested in promo&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40371-1/Easter-Egg"">Set 40371</a>&nbsp;than this polybag.</p>

<p>However, once I built this little Easter Bunny, I was quickly charmed by it. It looks much cuter in person than it did in the photos, and has some nice articulation (mostly the ears and the rotating head) so it can be posed in multiple ways.&nbsp;The little green Easter egg can be attached to the Bunny&#39;s hand (so it doesn&#39;t get lost or roll away), though the hand needs to be opened very wide so the egg can attach because it can&#39;t clear the Bunny&#39;s feet.</p>

<p>The finished build is smaller than I expected (about two minifigs tall with the ears all the way up), but in a good way. I think it is Lego&#39;s best-looking Easter Bunny since at least <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40086-1/LEGO-Easter"">Set 40086 (2014)</a>, which is larger and more detailed, but&nbsp;a bit less fun in my opinion.</p>

<p>The small size of this set&nbsp;makes it perfect for putting on a work desk or some other place you&#39;d like a small splash of seasonal color and fun.</p>

The Polybags are always pretty solid offerings with a lot of parts use. This particular item is extremely impressive and here are the pros and cons.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Very engaging and impressive build.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Cute looking finished model in yellow and white.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Easter Egg included.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Head moves a tad too easily, click-joint might have been better use than round tile spinning.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Not easy to find at retail.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I enjoyed the build here, it&rsquo;s very cute and works quite well. Originally a GWP in spring, this set has been harder to find at retail until recently. I&rsquo;d recommend getting one if you like the look of the model. Really impressive set and well worth picking up. Recommended.</p>

<p>Parts are good, but building experience/playability/price is meh.</p>
