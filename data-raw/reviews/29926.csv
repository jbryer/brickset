Although hardly an enthralling display piece, 40371 offers a miniature tour de force of building technique by seeking to represent the complex, rounded shape of an egg using pieces fundamentally unsuited to the task.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Each panel consists of layers of plates that bulge out in the center while dropping away to meet other panels of the corners, simulating the roundness of an egg. The effect is only partially successful, as the lower portion of the egg remains basically four-sided. The top, similarly featuring terraces of plates, is more successful. When separated, the uppermost (orange) section of the egg appears to be as close to a hemisphere as possible at this scale.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The egg offers almost a tutorial in sophisticated brick- and plate-based work, and its design is antithetical to recent tendencies to employ specialized pieces in order to achieve challenging shapes. In this respect 40371 evokes the design style of an earlier era of Lego.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

It separates into three sections, each with a different color on the outside. A cavity in the middle (white) section holds a cleverly designed but disproportionately small chick, an endearing cube with sides the dimension of 2x2 plates. In the lowest (lime) section, a shallower cavity houses extra quarter-circle tiles and flowers, which can be used to modify the design on the outside of the egg from the default tulips. 40371&rsquo;s potential for customization suggests the influence of the new Dots line; compare it to 41906 Pineapple Pencil Holder.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

As is often the case with sets designed by Caddick, 40371 abounds with desirable if not strictly necessary pieces: 2x4 plates in yellow, 4x1 purple bricks with the height of three ordinary bricks, and the wealth of plates in unusual colors.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

"Odeinoichus","2021-01-01T20:53:22.823Z","Awesome Seasonal GWP.","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #40371 Easter Egg:</b> Another GWP this year was this interesting LEGO set with a large highly decorative looking brick-built Easter Egg with a cute little baby chick model hidden inside. It&rsquo;s a very nice set and highly creative. Loved building it, loved receiving it and totally loved building it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a similar style package to the GWP Christmas sets with a nice little Limited Edition logo in one corner and a nice shot of the set, both opened and closed. A colourful green package design which really looks impressive.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual is a large one, larger than you might expect looking at the box. It&rsquo;s long and flat and not super thick, but easy to use and very well designed.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set includes a load of plates and tiles as it is a brick-built set. Not a lot of unique elements, but an awesome looking parts pack if you&rsquo;re into that sort of thing.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is a fairly involved build, mostly because you are making a very creative model with loads of intricate detail work for decorations and additional touches of fun. I enjoyed this build, making an egg shape out of LEGO without relying on too many curved pre-sculpted elements is a great touch of design work. To create the ovoid shape of the egg you mostly build a skeletal interior of square/rectangle shapes with outward-facing studs and attach built up plates to complete the look. It&rsquo;s a very clever build idea and one we&rsquo;ve probably seen before, but this is still fairly fun.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Once completed the Easter Egg stands on a shelf as a box-like storing device, in certain respects. You can lift up two sections and store spare studs and other detail pieces inside as well as a tiny brick-built chick which can pop out and waddle about as a play feature. Many wonderful colour choices allow the egg to be decorated and look great, if you enjoy displaying Holiday themed builds every holiday this is a must have model as a very nice centerpiece.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Really engaging build, really great display piece. Perfect GWP from LEGO Shop@Home. Glad I had the chance to get this, would recommend if you&rsquo;ve missed out on it and enjoy building holiday displays. I feel the only drawback to the set is its lack of availability. Secondary market is the only way to get it now, be prepared to pay for it.</p>

"DoonsterBuildsLego","2021-04-27T17:50:27.787Z","Some nice building techniques and good for parts","<p>This was previously a GWP but came available for sale at LEGO.com, so I picked one up as it&#39;s not too expensive with some nice building and parts I was looking for</p>

<p>The build is quite nice. There are 3 parts to the egg, as can be seen from the three colour sections from the main photo. The bottom, lime green portion acts as a storage pot for the spare decoration tiles, the middle, white section is where the chick sits and the yellow-orange is the top of the egg. The chick sits nicely inside the egg when it is closed up, but needs to be aligned properly; there are no studs to hold it in place.</p>

<p>Each section uses a nice build-up of layered plates to create the curved effect which are attached to a sideways assembly to form the overall egg.</p>

<p>A nice feature of the construction is that the white section attaches to the green with rather more studs that the top does, which means it take a little more effort to open the storage pot. This prevents accidental opening and spilling the contents.</p>

<p>I bought this mainly for the parts, being after some basic parts in lime green and yellow-orange. There is also a nice selection of decorative elements &amp; 1x1 flower pieces.</p>

<p>There is really very little play value in this one, just a chick in an egg. Much more of a display piece, and then not the most decorative, IMO.</p>

<p>For what I was looking for: some nice building techniques and the parts, I think it&#39;s good value for money. If those don&#39;t interest you, then there isn&#39;t too much else to recommend this.</p>
