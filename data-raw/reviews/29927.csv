<p><b>Packaging</b></p>

<p>The packaging is nothing special, just your regular minifigure pack.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions and building experience</strong></p>

<p>There are two instructions included: one for the minifigures and one for Cyrus Borg&#39;s legs. The assembly was simple and straightforward, since the set contains only 73pcs, and there were no errors in the manual. It took me about five&nbsp;minutes to put together.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Even though this set is very small, we do get a lot of interesting pieces. We have a recolour of the Legacy style ninja hood in white and warm gold, which is great for people who want to make their own golden ninja, or if you are just collecting all of the different ninja masks. We also have a &ldquo;new&rdquo; face print for the nindroids, which is identical to the one included in the Legacy Thunder Raider, except this one does not have an alternate face. There are also a lot of gold bar pieces in silver, which while they aren&#39;t exclusive, are still nice to get.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>In this set, we receive four&nbsp;minifigures: Golden Zane, Mindroid, a Nindroid Warrior and a Nindroid Drone. All of them are exclusive, which is very appreciated.</p>

<p>Obviously, the highlight of this set is Golden Zane himself. It is a bit disappointing that his mask is inaccurate to his appearance in the show, but he still looks great in his golden gi. However, I don&#39;t like&nbsp;that LEGO decided to include his face from the movie. If they could make a new face print for the Nindroids, why couldn&#39;t they reprint Zane&#39;s original face? Other than that, the minifigure is mostly faithful to how he looked like in Rebooted and overall, I am very happy to finally get Golden Zane in minifigure form. Zane also comes with a pair of golden shurikens.</p>

<p>The next figure is a generic Nindroid Warrior. Besides his head, he is identical to the version included in the Thunder Raider. Still, the minifigure looks very nice and is a fantastic army builder. Honestly, I have no complaints about him besides the fact that he could have benefited from an alternate face print. Nindroid Warrior comes with a red katana.</p>

<p>We also have a Nindroid Drone, who is almost the same as the Warrior. The only difference is the fact that the Drone does not include a mask piece. I don&#39;t have much to say about him, but much like the previous minifigure, he is great for building a Nindroid army.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Last, but definitely not least, we have the adorable Mindroid. Even though he is the same as a Nindroid Warrior (aside from the short legs of course), I think that he is an amazing inclusion and a great reference to the second episode of Rebooted. Again, I wish that he would have an alternate face. Much like Nindroid Warrior, Mindroid comes with a standard red katana, which LEGO seems to include with almost all Legacy Nindroids.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>In this set we have three small builds. A jetpack for the Drone, a backpack and Cyrus Borg&#39;s legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The jetpack looks very nice. I like how the silver katanas are used as the wings, and how the controls are actually able to be fit into any minifigure&#39;s hands. Other than that, there isn&#39;t too much to talk about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mindroid&#39;s backpack thing looks really weird, and I am not&nbsp;sure if it&#39;s even a backpack. I don&#39;t know what to say about it, other than the fact that Mindroid can barely stand&nbsp;with it on him. At least it includes another gold bar in silver...</p>

<p>Lastly, we have Cyrus Borg&#39;s mechanical legs. Clearly, it&#39;s meant to be a remake of the build included in the 2014 set OverBorg Attack, and I think that it represents the original really well. In total, it has 10 points of articulation. One in each leg and two in each arm. You can put a minifigure on top of the build and it can control it using the printed control panel. While we have seen this print in many Ninjago sets before, I still like it&#39;s inclusion. You can also fit a red katana into one of the arms and use it to fight&nbsp;Zane. However, arguably the biggest con against this set, is the fact that we don&#39;t have a Cyrus Borg minifigure to actually use these legs. Why would they include Borg&#39;s legs, if we don&#39;t have Borg in minifigure form? Yes, we have OverBorg, but that is Cyrus being possessed by the Overlord. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me. I know that I am just nitpicking, but to me personally, it&#39;s the same as if they didn&#39;t include Kai in the Legacy Kai Fighter. Other than that, I have no complaints about the actual build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Overall, I really like this set. If you want to get Golden Zane, or if you want to expand your Nindroid army, I recommend buying it. For 11.99, it&#39;s a good value for what you get, and I like that all figures are unique in one way or another.&nbsp;Unfortunately, all the cons I listed make this set far from perfect, which is a shame. However, if you don&#39;t care about these cons as much as I do, definitely buy this set. You will not be disappointed.</p>

<p><br />
The main reason I purchased this set is for the minifigures and they definitely don&#39;t disappoint. My favorite Minifgure is of course, Golden Zane. He exceptional printing on his torso (along with the face that has been used since the LEGO ninja movie), the cowl is good, but I wish he had leg printing. The nindroids also have nice printing but yet again, a lack of leg printing is sorta annoying. Some variety in the face printing would also be nice too. My favorite inclusion is what I believe to Mindroid, who is always great to get.</p>

<p><br />
Parts:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The weakest part of this set are the parts. The are no exclusive or hard to aqquire moulds or any interesting colors for pieces. The parts here are just average.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>The builds in this set are nothing too interesting, but still good. The backpack for mindroid is cute, but if he is not attached to a stud, he will fall over which can be annoying. The six-legged of what I believe to be a Mech, is cool and definitely an upgrade to 2014&#39;s Overborg Mech thing. I like the arms that have quite a lot of possibility. Also, while fiddling around with the build, I noticed that you can attach the arms of the Mech into Mindroid&#39;s backpack which gives options if you were to purchase multiples. The final build is the jet pack which is a nice build and I don&#39;t have many comments on.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<p>Its the cheapest way get a nindroid without having to spend $40+ dollars. Good minifigures, etc.</p>

<p>Cons:</p>

<p>This set isn&#39;t super interesting</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final Statement:</p>

<p>The set is a good way to collect nindroids, and a good way to Zane. But it does a few minor flaws.&nbsp;</p>

"digi_raptor","2021-03-09T17:34:42.61Z","Golden Zane figure pack","<p>This is a small minifigure accessory pack with four minifigs, golden Zane (lets be honest, the reason most of us get this), a nindroid, a nindroid drone and&nbsp;a mindroid (nindroid with small legs). This pack also comes with a jetpack and&nbsp;what I&#39;m assuming are evil Borgs legs and a backpack for mindroid. I would have liked to see more different minifigures, maybe even good&nbsp;Borg because all the figures except golden Zane have basically the same parts.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, I would just get it for the golden Zane and also for Nindroid army building</p>
