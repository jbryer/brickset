<p>My only issue is that the stickers for the model were missing from the box, so I have ordered them from Lego, let&#39;s hope they can supply them, otherwise it is a bit disappointing.</p>

<p>When you open this set you will find three un-numbered bags and a few larger pieces. The instructions are pretty standard and the sticker sheet is metallic.</p>

<p>Build</p>

<p>The build is fairly simple as it is based of a set made in 1980. It will only take you about fifteen minutes to build.</p>

<p>Stickers and Prints</p>

<p>As I mentioned earlier the sticker sheet is metallic but only the&nbsp;40th Anniversary&nbsp;sticker and the 7810 steam engine sticker are metallic. Instead of the DB logo there is a standard train logo because of licence issues. The print on the minifigures torso is different to the original there is a slight line of dark blue around the white printing.</p>

<p>Playability</p>

<p>There is not much to play with (as intended, it is a display piece).</p>

<p>Value</p>

<p>As a promotional item the value is perfect unless you are buying it on the third market. It will be anywhere around &pound;25/$25 on the third market.</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>I think it is a great set and you should definitely buy it. It is also a great set for AFOLS because it is a remake of an old set and many AFOLS have been asking for this type of set.</p>

Lego released the set as a gift with purchase in March 2020 as a 40th anniversary commemoration, but they&rsquo;re currently available at reasonable prices on Bricklink, where I bought mine. This review includes both criticism of the set and an account of powering it using a Power Functions M-Motor.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Building 1980 in 2020</b></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">40370 offers the curious experience of building an essentially 1980s-era design as a new set, which I found particularly interesting having built very few sets from before the mid-1990s. Its construction takes place in a single plane at any given time: one builds the set from the bottom up, layer by layer, rather than in different dimensions at different times. There are no advanced building techniques or specialized parts, so I focused on how to capture the shape of the locomotive rather than what part to use for a particular detail.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The set possesses an undeniable charm in its simplicity and austerity. Its proportions are elegant and understated, its angularities carefully varied. Note that it uses all three types of slope available in 1980. To borrow a concept from architectural criticism, the locomotive has a discretely modulating rhythm apparent above all in the wheels and the cylinders located above the boiler. Perhaps this explains why the original set used a 1x1 black brick rather than a cylinder for the third such piece: the disruption of the expected rhythm of cylinders provides asymmetry and complexity, and dissipates the focus that otherwise accrues to the cylinders. The aesthetic distinction is subtle but clear.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Setting aside the headlights and parts not present in 7810, the locomotive uses only two colors. The minifigure&rsquo;s components are molded from primary colors, with black-and-white printing. Simple bricks, simple colors, combined carefully.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Modifications from 7810</b></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The Steam Engine has been modified by the ubiquitous Mel Caddick in several important respects in order to compensate for the unavailability of now-defunct parts, especially the 6x16 train chassis. The chassis of 7810 included two round buffers on either end, as well as a hole below the level of the buffers to which magnetic couplers could be attached. Mel has redesigned the buffers with an ingenious combination of 2x2 torus tiles and round-bottomed plates, while 2x3 plates with holes provide places to attach couplers. Several further changes, all minor, appear to have been motivated by aesthetic considerations.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The engine looks superb when connected to rolling stock. I&rsquo;ve used spare couplers from the 9V system, but these must be attached upside down. Both the coupler and the space between the buffers have a width of two studs, so when attached right side up the coupler cannot rotate and disconnects while going around curves. Upside down the range of motion remains less than optimal but can accommodate curves. Before building the set, I expected that both the sequence of three wheels and their spacing might also present problems going around curves, and indeed the middle wheel does slightly scrape the tracks on the inside of curves. As a result of these problems, once motorized the engine struggles on curves.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Motorizing the engine</b></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">My curiosity having been piqued by the large empty space in the middle of the engine, I began to work out a means of motorizing it without recourse to a train motor, which would necessitate getting rid of the middle set of red wheels. I aimed to use the 8883 M-Motor to power all three axles while preserving the external appearance of the engine as much as possible. Driving one or two pairs of wheels could be accomplished relatively easily, as in 10194 Emerald Night (one powered axle) or 10277 Crocodile Locomotive (two powered axles). Powering the third pair of wheels, however, requires byzantine mechanisms, especially given the limited space.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Putting together a sufficiently compact set of gears proved challenging, but eventually I arrived at a solution. In short, pairs of bevel gears allow the motor to rotate a vertical axle that interacts with the horizontal axle attached to the foremost wheels. A chain connected to the vertical axle extends beneath the motor and drives the other pairs of wheels using identical pairs of bevel gears. A lengthier account follows; uninterested readers should skip two paragraphs down.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The M-Motor takes up nearly all available space inside the engine and must be surrounded by black panels, which hold up the 45&deg; slopes that form the top of the boiler. It rotates a 12-tooth bevel gear, stabilized slightly to account for the play in the motor, that interacts with a 20-tooth double bevel gear on a vertical 5l axle. When mounted in the engine the vertical 5l axle is secured at the top. Below the level of the motor, the 5l axle rotates an 8-tooth gear, which drives a chain connected horizontally to two further 8-tooth gears on 2l vertical axles. These three vertical axles each terminate in 12-tooth bevel gears, which interact with identical gears on the three horizontal axles that drive the wheels.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">A 2x6 plate with holes and a 7l half-width studless beam hold the entire assemblage together. The plate with holes is attached to the bottom of the M-Motor, extending two studs in front of the motor. Beneath the plate with holes lies the chain with its 8-tooth gears, below that the studless beam, and below that the 12-tooth bevel gears. Each of the vertical axles passes through the studless beam, and friction pins&mdash;between the three 8-tooth gears&mdash;connect the plate with holes to the studless beam.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">My solution is not ideal. It makes use of what must be illegal connections; the entire set of gears is suspended above the wheels, and only connects to the locomotive via the rear part of the M-Motor; 8-tooth gears cannot securely interact with the chain, and consequently the middle set of wheels can rotate independently. Moreover, the red wheels blacken at the point where they touch the track&mdash;this can be scrubbed off, but I advise not using the red wheels in a functional setup. Nevertheless, my solution fits within the limited space, it drives all three axles, and it preserves the external appearance of the engine. The M-Motor sticks out two studs into the cab but happily looks like a firebox with a square door.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">As with any solution involving Power Functions or Powered Up, mine requires a battery box and possibly an infrared receiver, presumably located in a tender. Because my interest lay in the mechanical challenge of fitting the motor inside 40370 I didn&rsquo;t bother with a matching tender, but I imagine that the easiest way to construct such a tender would be to purchase a second copy of the set.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>Running late, running early</b></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Builders less than intimately familiar with Lego&rsquo;s trains may be puzzled by the cryptic 40th anniversary designation. Motorized trains, originally 4.5V and running on blue track, originated in the mid-1960s; the celebrated 112-2 Locomotive with Motor dates from 1966. In 2016 Lego duly commemorated the 50th anniversary of the train line with 4002016 50 Years on Track, which included a miniature representation of 112-2. Had 40370 referred to the same event, it would have been running fourteen years late.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The anniversary being remembered is less important that the advent of the train line, however: in 1980 Lego replaced blue tracks with grey tracks and made the 12V system more widely available than it had previously been, as Huw has pointed out in his review. Did this anniversary motivate the release of 40370 or provide an excuse for it, I wonder? Moreover, its availability in March seems precipitous. Why did Lego not release 40370 in July as a promotion coinciding with 10277 Crocodile Locomotive?</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start"">&nbsp;</p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Setting aside the difficulty of motorizing it, 40370 offers an appealingly retro experience and a simple, well-designed steam engine that nonetheless holds its own next to more recent locomotives. Four stars.</span></span></span></p>
