"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-06T18:54:14Z","Another King Leo?  Well... at least throw in another minifig","This is yet another set that includes King Leo.  That's ok though, because the extra minifig with the neat helmet makes up for it.  I'm not really sure what the castle thing is for, but I assume that if you have a few more of these sets, you could make a nice little wall or tower.  ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-03T22:14:12Z","Overpriced","I bought it because I neede the extra set and didn't feel like having two of the same models. The king is useless if you have King Leo's Castle because the other horse is better. The castle piece is pointless. Add another good guy knight, one or two bad guys, at least one horse, add to the castle piece and this set would be awesome. Too bad that would double the price.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

The tower isn't much use alone unless king leo needs a royal out house. the soilder is nice along with the horse. since i only have one king leo I don't have a problemwith him and his silver sword.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-09-04T09:30:29.143Z","My Kingdom for a Horse!","This set is basically one of the King on a horse, but modified to include a second soldier (a squire?) and a bit of a castle wall.  The set is nicely coordinated with blues on the king, his saddle and the banner that his bannerman (squire?) is carrying.  There is not much building in this set other than assembling the minifigs.  One thing that would have been better would be to have included in the set a jousting helmet for the king so that he could be used as a knight instead.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2008-02-11T02:49:13.39Z","A horse, two mini figures and a castle top - yea baby!","Great set for the cost! I do have King Leo in other Knights Kingdom sets but can always use another horse and knight. The big castle window part is usefully in adding to bigger sets in the theme. Cost was around $6.00 at time of release and well worth it when you realize how you can use them to compliment the Kingdom.  Good set !!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-18T16:34:53.857Z","King Leo","Another small set of the castle theme and knights kingdom subtheme, this is the King Leo, released in the year of 2000. Like some impulse, this is basically a minifigure pack, due to the few building involved. The minigiures included are two, a knight and the king. The knight is simple, and have some characteristics of the currently castle sets (details and face, different of the classic minifigures, these from the 1990's years to the first castle years, that had basic details and faces). The knight still well made, and includes a helmet, a joust spear and a sword. The king still good too, due to the details, color scheme (the original blue and gold color schemes of the lego king), and also some itens like the sword, shield and the crown. The set also includes a horse minifigure, in a good shape (still good altough this don't moves the paws, because the minifigure fit well on it and the design is a basic lego style, but it could include more armors). The little tower, too included, is basically made by the tower and some bricks above, increasing it. Altough no much playable, this small set is well made and it is an addition to the castle sets. This set was sometimes and in some places, cheap, but now is a rarity, so it is now expensive for the size and nunmber of pieces. Another good option to increase castle sets, it is cool in comparison with small sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-12-12T17:50:35.437Z","Small But Good","This is a nice little set with some good stuff. I like the knight minifigure in this set but has no armor. King Leo is nice but not as cool as you would think. Also, what's with the small tower? This is small, but good.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BigTexan","2008-12-12T15:36:36.107Z","Meh.","I guess if you don't already have King Leo then you might want this set otherwise it's not really worth it. 

Pros
Knight minfig (not as good becasue he has no body armor, but the helmet is alright)

cons:
another awful castle piece
King Leo (not as cool as he looks)

"asianlego","2008-10-06T10:07:56.5Z","Thou shalt fight Bull with me!","This is the original Knights Kingdom before the arrival of wacky color-coded knights. I really like this set because it was my first set with a medieval setting (although there is not much ambience in this set). The castle wall piece was really great because it truly adds to the flavor of a true Castle set and also it helps alot if you are into medieval MOCs. The horse was excellent, my first horse. King Leo came with a nice printed shield and a golden crown. Also, one of his soldier was with him, and the soldier looked more like a Spanish-era soldier rather than a footsoldier trained in Medieval Europe. The soldier is an excellent addition as rarely do LEGO put an extra minifig into a set which is devoted to only a single minifig (hence the set's name, King Leo). This by far is the best Castle set that I have so far at the time of writing (if you check my collection, I do not have much castle sets) because it includeds two cool minifigs, an animal, a castle wall piece which rarely comes in cheap sets and some cool shiny weapons. Highly recommended! I give it a 5/5 on the spot!

"SaintElsewhere","2008-08-17T19:16:19.593Z","Strange as it seems, I still have this! ","This was supposed to be a stocking stuffer for Christmas almost a decade ago, but it got lost whilst in the box and I didn't find it until several years later. (Oh, well. If it hadn't been misplaced I probably wouldn't have it today. I was 5 at the time.)

Pros:
good army builder
comes with scenery, horse, and shining sword and crown (R-A-R-E)
King Leo and knight
I can add to my current army of knights (I don't have the good king)

Only king is useful on this set!
This set is not good army builder, if you buy two of these sets,
you will get two Kings!

Pros:

King with crown, sword, sheild and Horse.
Knight with sword and flag.

Cons:

The horse has no head protection or else,
Tower piece is useless
And King doesn't have any body armor.

"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-27T10:17:03.32Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom I) - King Leo Review","This set is probably the smallest set of the LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom I) theme. It has two minifigs and one of them is the king who has a golden crown. This set is the cheapest way to find this king in. It's a great set to get for pieces and for minifigs. It's also a great army builder. Even if I like this set it doesn't have any play features. I think you should try to get the bigger models first before you get this one.<br><br>All

"DrathMaul1997","2010-12-03T15:06:58.247Z","Castle? Hardly...","Right, sorry if I state things you can plainly see in the picture, but it <i>is</i> a small set. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>King 'Leo':</b></div><div>Quite a nice figure, his torso has a lion/shield emblem on it that is copied onto his shield. He also has Printed legs, a rarity at the time (still is I believe) and this really enhances the model. His face is nice, but shows up chew marks well, *sigh*. He comes with a stranded white horse with blue saddle, a shield, and a big shiny sword. This figure looks far better with a red cape. (as in 4726)&nbsp;</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Knight:</b></div><div>Again, a nice mini figure. His armour is very 'pretty', and quite intricate, he has printed legs as well. His hat is a rare-ish one, and seems to have an archer feel about it for some reason, his head is also very detailed, though sadly you can't see much of the detail when you put the helmet on... He comes with a small but classic sword and banner pole with blue flag.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Castle</b></div><div>Well, it's a castle 'block' with a three small 1v2 bricks on top. Not very good really, as you can barely fit a mini-fig inside. You could put it in front of your castle as a watch tower, or use it in a MOC, apart from that it's not much good.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div><b>Overall</b></div><div>A cool little set, this provides you with a king if you can't afford the £80 pound sets, give him a cape, and he's ready to rule the kingdom. Every king needs a combined adviser/friend/second-in-command (that normally gets killed in act 1) and this set gives you that as well. If you have a king-size hole in your collection, and can get it for around £2-3 pound, I'd high recommend it. :) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</div>",TRUE,4,4,3,3,4
"ZeldaTheSwordsman","2014-01-02T01:38:37.6Z","An early mini-battlepack, but a nice one.","In 2000, a subtheme of Castle known as ""Knights' Kingdom"" debuted, bringing a resurgence of medieval knights and soldiers good and bad. The protagonists are led by King Leo, who is apparently a son of the king from the last round of Castle sets. The antagonists, are led by a knight known as Cedric the Bull, who is Leo's estranged youngest brother. He is the old king's thirteenth son, who came along to late to be able to inherit any of his father's lands. He has thus recruited various outlaws to form a small army with which to oust Leo and take his brother's kingdom for his own. So, standard medieval land inheritance conflict rather than any myth arc. A number of sets were produced, mostly impulse sets with one or two minifigures and either a vehicle or a castle component.<br><br>This is one of the latter, and a very small one at that. It's mainly concerned with doing what it says on the tin: providing you with King Leo. King Leo has a kingly beard and moustache and a generally regal countenance. He has torso printing, as well as leg and belt (!) printing, that suggests he is clad in plate armor whose cuirass is covered with a tabard showing his crest. His head is protected by a gold-chromed field crown, and he is armed with his Silver Sword. He carries a shield with his crest, and is mounted upon his personal horse. As this set simply depicts him riding through his kingdom, the horse wears only a saddle and no barding.<br><br>Also included is Richard the Strong, his chief knight. Richard wears plate armor and a helmet with a broad brim, and is armed with a standard sword. He has belt printing too, which is nice. On the box he is seen toting the included lance with a flag hung from it, which can be wielded by either him or Leo, or clipped to the horse's saddle so that Leo can ride around with banner flying.<br><br>Last, for a bit of scenery there is a dark gray ""tower with arrow slit"" piece, with some light gray bricks atop it to give it crenelations. It could be a thing to add to the main castle, or it could be left as a lookout post amidst Leo's kingdom (as suggested by the box image), providing a watchman with both a vantage point and a sheltered spot to shoot from.<br><br>Overall, not bad for a cheap proto-battlepack. Really only something to skip if you already have the big King Leo's Castle set, as unlike the other Lions faction impulse sets it doesn't add that much (though Richard's body and helmet are certainly good for head-swapping to make an extra soldier).<br>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,5
