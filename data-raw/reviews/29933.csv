<br />
In terms of parts, this might be my favorite of the Dots bracelets. Firstly, the black bracelet is the most neutral color of the first wave and as such it&#39;s the most adaptable to your style regardless of your gender or your preferred fashion style. Secondly, this is the only set in the first wave to feature the new opalescent gem tiles, which are really incredible to look at in person. The printed parts are also fantastic&mdash;aesthetically they remind me of one of my favorite stages from the &quot;Kirby&quot; video games, Candy Constellation. And that candy aesthetic extends even to the unprinted quarter circle tiles, which span a wide range of pastel colors that remind me of candies like American SweetTarts or Smarties.<br />
<br />
As far as the build experience is concerned, a set this small goes together fast&mdash;but the real joy is in customizing it to your liking. No instructions are even included, so you&#39;re free to arrange the parts however you want. With that in mind, the printed quarter circle tiles with stars and star trails are great to work with&mdash;they don&#39;t suffer from the same problem as the rainbow tiles in one of the other sets, which have to be arranged in a certain direction for the pattern of the colored stripes to match up.<br />
<br />
This would all be plenty of playability even just on its own, but if you go into your own collection you can customize even more. The black bracelet goes well with all colors of parts, so you can come up with all sorts of great patterns. Some that I&#39;ve tried out include a Pink Floyd-esque rainbow pattern with multicolored tiles or a simple, classy design that simply uses silver 1x2 ingots to form a metallic band. I do find that it&#39;s more fun to use a variety of parts like the ones included in the set than to do a simple design with only one style of part, since that allows you to rearrange the parts as a sort of fidget toy when you&#39;re bored, even if you don&#39;t have other parts with you.<br />
<br />
The price point of these sets is great, as well. The bracelet itself does cut into the price per piece a bit, but that&#39;s mitigated a bit by the fact that every other piece in the set comes as an extra. That means that there&#39;s really more like forty parts in the set. And of course, the bracelet itself is the main attraction. Between the size and versatility of that and the fact that all the decorated parts are printed (no stickers!), five dollars seems pretty reasonable.</p>

"Minifig290","2020-03-15T22:15:23.337Z","Perfect for the fashionable creative minds","<p>Hello all, today I&#39;ll be looking at one of the 5 LEGO Dots bracelets released in the initial wave of the theme. This is the 41903 Cosmic Wonder that contains 33 pieces and sells for &pound;/$4.99 with a price per part of 15p. Let&#39;s take a look of what is included.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Well lets take a look at the most interesting piece first the new bracelet that is in a black colour for this set. This bracelet has a 2x14 stud area but measures at around 21cm long. There are 5 holes that are to connect to a peg on the underside so it fits snuggly on your wrist. The feel of the band is comparable to that of a mini doll hair piece, but this band is very flex-able.</p>

<p>Placing bricks onto the band is a big thing and if they are 1x1 studs and tiles they will stay on very well, they all fit onto the studs very well and i cannot see them falling off unless they are put under some serious stretching and i mean serious.</p>

<p>Now there are 32 small 1x1 tiles in an array of colours and styles to spruce up your bracelet, lets take a look at the piece you get starting with the special printed and new parts.</p>

<p><strong>- Diamond Stud in Iridescent White (Qty x6, plus 1 extra)</strong> this piece is a new moulded piece that is at the bottom a hexagon shaped piece and that all meets up in the middle</p>

<p><strong>- 1x1 Round Tile in Aqua Blue with Saturn print (Qty x2, plus 1 extra)</strong> the Saturn is pink and light yellow with a black outline and the outer ring is also printed in black, a few gold stars surround it&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>- 1x1 Corner Tile in Teal with Space Design print (Qty x4, plus 1 extra)</strong> the space design has pink and purple lines outlining the curve and inner corner, in the middle of the two sets of lines is a trail of yellow dots which i can assume to be stars.</p>

<p><strong>- 1x1 Corner Tile in Teal with Space Design and Shooting Star print (Qty x4, plus 1 extra) </strong>same as the piece above but in the middle of the two sets of lines is a star that is leaving a trail of yellow dots with some grey dots ahead of it.</p>

<p>Now to the unprinted corner tiles included</p>

<p>A great selection of parts to decorate the band with, and many great designs to be made.</p>

<p>___________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This bracelet is the best of the 5 released in the first wave, the Black band is very much a colour i can see many adults happy to wear unlike the other vibrant pinks and blues in the other sets. The selection of new printed tiles and the diamond stud piece is amazing especially for a &pound;/$4.99 set which is very easy to buy at most retailers.</p>

<p>I recommend this set to anyone who wants to spice up their outfits but also to anyone wanting to give this theme a try as this set offers some of the greatest possibilities in designs and looks. This small bracelet has been the most popular from what I&#39;ve seen with many places going OOS or putting this on back order since its release in March 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Pros -</strong> Great selection of pieces, perfect balance of most parts, the black bracelet is very useful to many more people than the other colours</p>

<p><strong>Cons -</strong> Wished there was 4 of the Saturn printed tiles to balance out the entire set and only 4 of the diamond studs and not 6 but i can live with how it is rn.</p>
