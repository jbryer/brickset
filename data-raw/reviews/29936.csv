"Minifig290","2020-03-03T21:19:57.673Z","Perfect Tile Pack","<p>Hello all, today I&#39;ll be looking at the LEGO Dots 41908 Extra Dots set released within the first wave of the new LEGO theme Dots. Released March 1st 2020 this set which retails for &pound;/$3.99 contains 109 pieces with a price per part of 3p/c.</p>

<p>Included in this set are 109 small 1x1 tiles with 10 being different in each pack lets take a look what each pack contains.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Well lets get straight into what every pack will include, there 99 pieces that are in every single Extra Dots pack these are:</p>

<p><strong>1x1 Corner Tile in Teal (Qty x20, plus 1 extra)</strong></p>

<p><strong>1x1 Corner Tile in Magenta (Qty x20, plus 1 extra)</strong></p>

<p><strong>1x1 Corner Tile in Light Pink (Qty x19, plus 1 extra)</strong></p>

<p><strong>1x1 Corner Tile in Spring Green (Qty x20, plus 1 extra)</strong></p>

<p><strong>1x1 Round Tile in Trans-light Blue with glitter (Qty x20, plus 1 extra)</strong></p>

<p>That&#39;s some nice tiles to get many of especially those glitter infused 1x1 round tiles exclusive at this time to this small set</p>

<p>Then the remaining 10 pieces are handful of exclusive printed 1x1 round white tiles. There are 10 in a pack and 16 different ones to collect, plus with every pack there will be a extra and from my experience that will be a duplicate of one of the 10 included so technically there are 11 charms but officially 10. These tiles, or charms, are either Emojis or icons.</p>

<p>There 16 different charms to collect are:</p>

<p>Emojis:</p>

<p><strong>- Crying Emoji ;(</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Laughing out loud (LOL) Emoji</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Winking Emoji ;)</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Kissing with heart eyes Emoji</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Sad Emoji :(</strong></p>

<p><strong>- Happy Smiling Emoji (:</strong></p>

<p>Icons:</p>

<p><strong>- Watermelon </strong><em>(Teal green, white, and salmon pink with black seeds)&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>- Strawberry </strong><em>(Mostly salmon pink but a small bit of teal green for the leaves and yellow for its seeds)</em></p>

<p><strong>- Purple Leopard Print</strong> <em>(purple and white)</em></p>

<p><strong>- Lightening Bolt </strong><em>(yellow lightening bolt surrounded by lavender)</em></p>

<p><strong>- Music Note</strong> <em>(white music note surrounded by salmon pink)</em></p>

<p><strong>- Bone </strong><em>(white bone surround by black)</em></p>

<p><strong>- Skull </strong><em>(white skull with love heart eyes in purple. Skull outlined in purple surrounded by light blue)</em></p>

<p><strong>- Rainbow Heart </strong><em>(heart outlines in teal, with top to bottom salmon pink, yellow, teal, aqua blue and purple inside the heart. Heart surrounded by white)</em></p>

<p><strong>- Rainbow Poo </strong><em>(rainbow poo surrounded by black space with stars, the rainbow poo&#39;s colours are marbled)</em></p>

<p><strong>- Diamond </strong><em>(white diamond with teal outlines surrounded by light blue and stars)&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>A great selection of different tiles, so far I&#39;ve brought two packs and got 13 out of the 16 tiles, plus a few extra ones. These are great for adding onto the bracelets that LEGO are releasing in conjunction with this set for &pound;/$5.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is a great tiles pack for anyone wanting some unusual tiles, and judging by the Series 1 hopefully there are more series down the pipeline though they will only be released depending on the success of the initial wave of Dots sets. So far this set is already OOS at LEGO Shop in the UK so that is a good start for this theme.</p>

<p>This set is a great little pocket money toy or well done treat along with one of the bracelets, also i can see some of these tiles being used in interesting ways for MOCs, so yes i definitely recommend this set to most people. The 3.99 price is fantastic for 109 pieces albeit small parts but the 3p/c ppp is immense.</p>

<p>Pros - Great pieces, Brilliant price and PPP, unique idea</p>

<p>Cons - Would have love some more tiles to have collected but just a nit picky complaint.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is now available in the UK LEGO Shop:</p>

The person writing before me covered it perfectly, and I suggest you read that&nbsp;if you&#39;re interested in this set, but this &quot;review&quot; is just a disclaimer of sorts.</p>

<p>The picture on the package and online suggest that there will be lots of little emoji tiles in the pack, but this will not always be the case, as the tile distribution is somewhat random. I recently ordered a pack from LEGO Shop and mine only had two emoji tiles (smiley and laughing-&#39;til-crying faces). This was a bit disappointing for me (I wanted to use the emojis on&nbsp;creepy robots or as warhead tips), so I will be buying another pack.</p>

<p>I&#39;m very pleased with this set overall, and I hope The LEGO Group produces more series, but you should know what you are getting into, in case the pictures throw you off. Thanks for reading!</p>

"Padmewan","2020-05-25T17:44:44.767Z","Perfect fit for a certain audience","<p>My younger child loves playing with Lego doodads and will spend far more time decorating a build than on the build. Lego must have noticed lots of kids like that in their focus group, because this kind of bag is exactly what I was looking for, for her.</p>

<p>Yes, this is a parts bag, and either you&#39;re looking for one-bit decorative pieces, or you&#39;re not. There are unique pieces here which, again, you either want or you don&#39;t. They are all printed - no stickers here - and look very pretty.</p>

<p>The value is meh on sheer plastic alone, but I imagine that doesn&#39;t account for the considerable printing on a large portion of the pieces.</p>

<p>Overall, a great way to acquire doodads.</p>

<p>Extra dots series one is a very great parts pack and can be used very well with the rest of the dots line up .</p>

<p>The parts-</p>

<p>&nbsp;The pieces include ten randomly selected surprise charms that are not all different I got one happy crying face , two happy faces , one thing face , two rainbow hearts , one strawberry , one disappointed face , one leopard print and one watermelon print , the other pieces are spring green corner tiles , dark pink corner tiles , teele corner tiles , pink corner tiles and glitter infused 1&times;1 round tiles .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>there is a very good selection of parts for any Lego fan the only downside is the fact I didn&#39;t get the rainbow poop tile :(</p>
