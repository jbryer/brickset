<p>Not much playability besides customization and the ability to hang stuff on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;Ok parts, considering you get a lot of colorful pieces. It&#39;s an ok value to part ratio, but there are a lot of small pieces.&nbsp;The&nbsp;building experience was ok and I did like some creative parts of the Stand.</p>
