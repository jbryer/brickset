"dirkberlin","2021-01-12T09:03:44.2Z","Great Set with a few problems","<p>I bought my Lamborghini during Black Friday. The date code is 33S0, so my guess is, that it was produced in August 2020. In this box is discolouring still a problem. It&#39;s not a single part, but as already mentioned the 22961 Connector is the worst. But all printed parts are greener, then the rest. I don&#39;t know if they are in the right colour, and the rest not or reverse.</p>

<p>Beyond the greenest print parts, and the much yellow connector in the middle there are a few parts notable. The 1x2 lift arms coming in 2 tones and a Panels #21 and #22 that are often used together have another colour. So the worst part of my car is the spoiler on the end.</p>

<p>I hope there will a solution by Lego.</p>

<p>Another thing: The manual. The set has a few technic elements, but nowhere is described what the switches do. I bet that both, the one in the middle and that behind the steering wheel are for the gear. Do both the same? I don&#39;t know. The car is not very playable because of its size. And of course the Steering wheel is not in an easy to handle position.</p>

<p>It is my third technic set based on lift arms after my dark ages. With a few breaks it took nearly 13 hours on to days to complete it. I was in no hurry.</p>

<p>With the special key on the plate&nbsp;(and no registration) you get at the Lego Si&aacute;n a few digital goodies. Some background images based on graphics from the manual, a few posters as a pdf, some car sounds to use as ringtones a generated ultimate certificate with the code and your entered name. Nothing what you really need.</p>

<p><img alt=""Color Problem Sian"" src=""https://www.winhistory.de/ebay/lambo.jpg"" style=""width: 600px; height: 260px;"" /></p>

<p>Update January 21: I send the Lego Team an email&nbsp; with the question if there is a repair kit or whatever because the miss colouring. About a week later I get a message, that one part 6308234 did not have their standards, and they will send it to me. It&#39;s the pin to axe connector which is included 8x times. More is often included the one with pinhole and pin connector. Short story, I made a list of parts, which I think missed my standards. So there is support.</p>

<p>Update February 2nd: Mails from Lego. First I got an Email from Lego Service. They are sorry, but colour differences are normal, Si&aacute;n is known, but there are no new parts in stock, so every part they will send be discoloured too. But my photos will be sent quality control. 10 Minutes later I&#39;ve got a second mail (this is caused I send 2 replies of the last answer, because I forgot one piece), they are sorry and will send me all parts from the list. Third thing was a letter from Lego. The 6308234 from first contact, which was known as problem part. And it is... discoloured. Have the same yellowish lime tone like the old ones. So waiting for the new parts arriving, but I think the first email says the truth: 1. All sets, even newly produced have still the problem, 2. Because of the parts are still the same, maybe it&#39;s corona, but no new are produced and no piece got replaced.</p>

<p>Update: February 8ths: Few Parts from support, 10 small liftarms, one liftarm, one panel 21. Short story: The liftarms are helpful, I could replace the greenish from the back of the car. The panel 21 is now much better than the ones in the set. Only problem, I need 10 more. The other connector is still too yellow. So I ask for more panels, the connectors will be a story for much later times. To be continued.</p>

"chief7575","2021-01-18T16:06:25.623Z","Beautiful car, very challenging build!","<p>This was my first foray into a really&nbsp;advanced technic car set.&nbsp; I have a few other technic sets, but they all pale in comparison to this beast after all is said and done.</p>

<p>When I saw this model come out, I immediately wanted it.&nbsp; Green is my favorite color and this style of Lamborghini is amazing.&nbsp; The designers of this did an incredible job of replicating the real car into LEGO form.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building this beast.&nbsp; I spent the better part of 3 weekends assembling this car.&nbsp; Just putting together the extremely complicated gear box, in bag 1, took nearly 4 hours in itself!&nbsp; Add in the back suspension, and I was pushing at least 5 hours.&nbsp; I built this slowly and deliberately, as to not make a mistake.&nbsp; That worked for the most part, until I got to the end of box one 1 and had 2 significant gears left over!&nbsp; I knew that couldn&#39;t be right, as you never get extra gears for leftover parts.&nbsp; Thankfully, I was able to determine where I had erred&nbsp;and was able to carefully disassemble the section to correct my mistake.&nbsp; This is just one example of how extraordinarily tricky it was to build this entire car.</p>

<p>[img]https://i.imgur.com/dZiucyY.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>Building the 12-cylinder working engine was a new challenge as I had not dealt with a lot of the parts needed to build this type of engine before.&nbsp; Adding a couple of round &quot;teeth&quot; to a spinning pin assembly did not compare to how this engine was assembled.&nbsp; A couple photos of parts and how the engine turned out.&nbsp; Also, you can see how the drive train runs the length of the car and actually can be controlled by a gear shifter that is built in the next sequence of steps.&nbsp; Yet another remarkable bit of ingenuity to figure out how to make such an affect work in a LEGO set.</p>

<p>[img]https://i.imgur.com/atKKZfJ.jpg[/img][img]https://i.imgur.com/x485sem.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>Here you can see where you finish the cover for the engine and the trunk (which is in the front), plus the steering assembly is taking shape and the gear shifter is now added, from what I had mentioned earlier.&nbsp; Plus, body framing is starting to happen.</p>

<p>[img]https://i.imgur.com/GTLS9mL.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>One of the most challenging aspects is trying to line up the front headlights.&nbsp; They are very uniquely represented by 3 white modified bars, with stop rings.&nbsp; The geometry to create the 3 very different angles needed to produce the triangular effect, is brilliant, albeit confusing!&nbsp; I had my issues trying to read the instructions correctly, as a couple of spots were deceiving as to which way the pieces lined up.&nbsp; Plus, connecting the last white bar on the first headlight is also confusing, as it shows one of the parts oriented the wrong direction in the instructions.&nbsp; One I figured out that error, I was able to get everything lined up correctly.</p>

<p>[img]https://i.imgur.com/AOfbk09.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>Even building the seats was a challenge.&nbsp; I&#39;m not complaining, as I absolutely loved every minute of constructing this beauty.&nbsp; Plus, mad props again to the designer, for being able to figure out how to hide the functionality, to create the scissor motion for each car door by hiding in along the bottom and underneath the doors themselves.&nbsp; Plus leaving enough space in the top near the roof, to actually activate these scissor doors, without compromising the look and feel of the car itself.&nbsp; BRILLIANT!&nbsp; And also managing to fit in a &quot;foot&quot; lever on the passenger side that kicks up the back spoiler.&nbsp; Another mechanical&nbsp;challenge that pays off.</p>

<p>[img]https://i.imgur.com/htyKEPN.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>I love that no details were spared, even a &quot;simple&quot; thing such as robust printed pieces to represent the disc brakes.&nbsp; Plus the exquisite gold rims and massive wheels to further make the model look more authentic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I loved everything about this set, from the beginning to the end.&nbsp; Plus, with all of the working functions that I have mentioned already, you actually can play with this amazing model!&nbsp; This set earns my absolute highest marks and immediately jumped into my top 5 sets to have of all time.&nbsp; I&#39;ve added a few more pics at the end to show other details and the end results.</p>

<p>If you read only the <strong>bold text </strong>you can get the point, and it won&#39;t be a tl:dr writing.</p>

<p>To find those parts easier switch to <strong>&quot;light mode&quot;</strong>.</p>

<p>Thx</p>

<p>------------</p>

<p>I like Technic, but I have no so much Technic sets. Last time I checked out all of those sets on <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/year-2021/theme-Technic"">Brickset</a> and I realised that there were only 3 must-have sets for me. It seemed I got picky through the years. But no problem because it is easier to collect 3 sets then hundreds:) So I started to collect them.</p>

<p>The first one was the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/9398-1/4x4-Crawler"">9398</a>. I wrote a <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/58359"">review</a> on it. Then I acquired <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42115-1/Lamborghini-Si%c3%a1n-FKP-37"">42115</a>&nbsp; and I thought to keep writing reviews. (The next one would be the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42100-1/Liebherr-R-9800"">42100</a>.) The Lamborghini is a totally different set than the Crawler 4x4 that&rsquo;s why I wrote my review from a different aspect.</p>

<h3>The good points</h3>

<p>First of all, this set &ndash; for me &ndash; <strong>contains (almost) everything</strong> that a non-motorized/non-RC set should contain:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>active steering wheel;</strong></li>
	<li><strong>suspensions;</strong></li>
	<li><strong>openable bonnets and doors;</strong></li>
	<li><strong>fake engine;</strong></li>
	<li><strong>4wd;</strong></li>
	<li><strong>automatic gear lever (in the middle);</strong></li>
	<li><strong>sport car gear shifts (by the steering wheel);</strong></li>
	<li><strong>more thousand pieces;</strong></li>
	<li><strong>beautiful looking;</strong></li>
	<li><strong>complex, well visible gear box.</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Even the box</strong> itself is beautiful. In some reviews the box was graded down because of no pictures on the functions as on the common Lego boxes. I think it is better in that way, not full of sensationalist pictures &ndash; I like minimalism. Not mentioning that ridiculous comment that you cannot remove the boxes in order &ndash; wow, big deal. Anyway after you removed the 6th box you can remove the 1st one and keep continue in order&hellip; &nbsp;</p>

<p>Now I have to point out the last two items.</p>

<ul>
	<li>It is only <strong>my taste</strong>, but I hate the shape of Porsche, Ferrari, Bugatti, etc; nothing special and most of them look like a clown shoe. I like the cars with <strong>wedge-shaped</strong> front like some types of Lamborghini and scissor doors of course. That was one reason I chose this set.</li>
	<li>From the beginning in Technic cars <strong>gear box has been a must-have thing</strong>. With Si&aacute;n Lego gained the set with the most complex transmission system. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-e_vOJdyhG0"">Here</a> is a video how it works. Anyway mine has too much friction in 2nd and 6th gear. I have a guess: in 2nd gear 10 more gears are used actively than in 1st and 3rd gear. Actually in 4th gear only 3 more gears are used, and after the 4-cycle ends comes the multiplier.</li>
</ul>

<p>I mentioned just before that it contains (almost) everything. &ldquo;Almost&rdquo; means the lack of adjustable seats. It wouldn&rsquo;t be a big problem but there is another problem connecting to it and for that I have to grade down the set a bit &ndash; and there is even an <a href=""https://www.lego.com/hu-hu/product/lamborghini-sian-fkp-37-42115"">official photo</a> on it. I will write about it later.</p>

<h3>The bad points</h3>

<p>If we are here let&rsquo;s continue with other failures.</p>

<p><strong>I read many comments and reviews</strong> mainly on Lego&rsquo;s homepage. They had problems (disregarding the colour difference) with missing and broken pieces and building instruction errors. The reports on missing and broken pieces were quite convicting but on the instruction errors they were ridiculous. However, I started thinking: is it possible that so many people got the set with missing pieces in the beginning, then later on something happened and that problem got fixed? Was the instruction maybe also a mess in the beginning, but now it is okay? And what about the broken parts? Those seemed serious&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>I watched some YouTube comparisons</strong> also. Just forget them. As always most of them start with preconception&hellip;</p>

<p><strong>In many cases the price was questioned</strong>. Come on, how can you speak about price in different countries in different economic status and different people? The only thing I can say is that in my country the price dropped 20% not so long after it had released. Maybe the result of the tons of criticism&hellip;</p>

<p>[img]http://www.kepfeltoltes.eu/images/2021/03/05/733Screenshot_2021_03_05_.png[/img]</p>

<p>And<strong> the colour difference</strong>: yes it has. I can see also. Maybe some people are more lime-sensitive than others. By the way, in the booklet where you can read about the Lego Si&aacute;n project they are always talking about perfection. Well, that kind of colour difference is obviously not perfection.</p>

<p>In my opinion <strong>there are other worse things than colour</strong>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Look at the <strong>distance between the steering wheel and the front ledge of the seat</strong>. No space for legs! I haven&rsquo;t read about that objection anywhere else, maybe it is only my problem but maddening for me.</li>
</ul>

<p>[img]http://www.kepfeltoltes.eu/images/2021/03/05/399IMG_7061.jpg[/img]</p>

<p>I added an updated section here (2022.01.29)</p>

<p>I was wondering the proportions of the car for months and came to the following conclusions.</p>

<ul>
	<li>I knew from the beginning that as a 1:8 model<strong> the front wheel floor clearance</strong> which is about 8 mm means that the real car would have only about 6-7 cm front clearance and that is not true It is important because of the playability.</li>
	<li>It is told on many forums that the car is too flat. I don&#39;t think so. I made the roof taller but it didn&#39;t help. The <strong>front </strong>is not flat enough. Just compare to the original one.</li>
	<li>The <strong>seats </strong>are too small. Imagine a man standing next to the car, then imagine it having a seat.</li>
	<li><strong>Dashboard</strong> <strong>upper</strong> is too long.</li>
</ul>

<p>Well I believe that designing such a set is difficult, but longer time would help to correct those failures.</p>

<p>End of updated section</p>

<ul>
	<li>And there are <strong>other small design failures</strong> I will mention in the &quot;Modifications&quot; chapter.</li>
	<li>The last: <strong>some cover parts are wobbling</strong>. Not so much but needed to notice.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Modifications</h3>

<p><strong>I found a bunch of good and not complicated modifications</strong> on YouTube <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QvMVl3g2hkY"">here</a>. Some are very much justifiable, especially the bonnet mod.</p>

<p><strong>I also made some and thought some</strong> that I haven&rsquo;t seen or read anywhere else. Here they are.</p>

<ul>
	<li>I mentioned the <strong>space</strong> between the steering wheel and the seat. I could earn a bit space with an Oo-pin, a 6-long-axle and a 2-sized ring removing some other parts. Later on I put a half-sized ring just behind the steering wheel because with that, parts fit together better.</li>
</ul>

<p>[img]http://www.kepfeltoltes.eu/images/2021/04/29/957IMG_7106.jpg[/img]</p>

<ul>
	<li>I mentioned before the wobbling parts also. The <strong>doors</strong> are such parts. So I just put one-one black, 2-sized, symmetric pin in the door upper side behind the end of the black beams. In that way if you close the doors by the lever next to the Italian flag and if you strain the levers the doors will also get strained.</li>
</ul>

<p>[img]http://www.kepfeltoltes.eu/images/2021/03/05/185IMG_7067.jpg[/img]</p>

<ul>
	<li>I had problem with the<strong> front suspension height</strong> also. For better playability (not to hit even the thinnest! carpet) just remove the 3-long white rod from the upper rocking-arm. That&rsquo;s all.</li>
</ul>

<p>[img]http://www.kepfeltoltes.eu/images/2021/03/05/935IMG_7069.jpg[/img]</p>

<ul>
	<li>I removed the holed part from the front of the <strong>cover of the engine</strong> to make it removable easier. And transparent motor cover (that doesn&#39;t exist) on the sides would be better to see the cylinders moving.</li>
</ul>

<p>[img]http://www.kepfeltoltes.eu/images/2021/03/05/682IMG_7065.jpg[/img]</p>

<ul>
	<li>The <strong>glove compartment</strong> can be made openable with a 2-long, a 3-long pin, an Oo-pin and changing a 2-sized perpendicular connector to a 3-sized one.</li>
</ul>

<p>[img]http://www.kepfeltoltes.eu/images/2021/04/29/213IMG_7109.jpg[/img]</p>

<ul>
	<li>I linked a YouTube video on 9 modifications and I made the <strong>bonnet mod</strong>+. Just one thing is missing from the mod: the <strong>fender arc correction</strong> with a 3-long-axle connector instead of the original length of 4 units. So I did it.</li>
</ul>

<p>[img]http://www.kepfeltoltes.eu/images/2021/04/29/126IMG_7108.jpg[/img]</p>

<ul>
	<li>When I changed gears, I pushed the <strong>dashboard</strong> above, and it was coming apart somewhere. So I just put more connector pins in it. Anyway, a 4-1-1-sized, asymmetric roof part (that doesn&#39;t exist) behind the dashboard of the meters would be nicer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Summary in few words</h3>

<p>The good points</p>

<ul>
	<li>Basically<strong> EVERYTHING</strong> except the few bad points :)</li>
</ul>

<p>The very bad point</p>

<ul>
	<li>Distance between the steering wheel and the seat</li>
	<li>Seat, dashboard, and front proportional problems</li>
</ul>

<p>Not so bad points</p>

<ul>
	<li>Some wobbling parts</li>
	<li>Some easily fixable but left as they were design defects</li>
	<li>Ye old colour difference :)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Despite the design failures I can say this set is almost 10 from 10, maybe 9 but definitely not less.</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>UPDATE 2021.06.03</h3>

<p>After few months standing on the shelf the engine with the gearbox and the gearshift system got a significant stuck. Nothing special happened.</p>

<ul>
	<li>I checked the car first.</li>
	<li>Later on I disassembled while checking carefully.</li>
	<li>I assembled again checking carefully.</li>
	<li>And finally I checked the newly rebuilt car.</li>
</ul>

<p>My results</p>

<p><strong>Bending of the beams and axles</strong></p>

<p>When I was pushing the car holding the upper crossbeams there was no problem at all. Bending the whole car downward on the ends then checking the motor output at the gear in the middle of the tunnel, it moved smoother than before, and pushing immediately after the bending caused smoother run but not as good as new. The engine output gear moved like a bent axle in a bent hole. What else could it be than the parts have bent during staying on the shelf?</p>

<p><strong>The rebuilt car</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>During the disassembling I discovered that in step 8 part <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4142865/2m-cross-axle-w-groove"">4142865</a> is used instead of part <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4206482/conn-bush-w-fric-crossale"">4206482</a>. I could check the old prepared gear box with the new part, and it moved already smoother.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I changed only those parts in step 8, and I put all the rubber bands in X (not O as in the instruction) position. The gear and engine system works perfectly now. If it goes wrong again it must be the bending...</p>

<h3>UPDATE 2021.06.23</h3>

<p>20 day after my last result: nothing happened, and it started getting stuck especially in 2nd gear. <strong>It must be the bending deformation</strong> this time, again! Playability decreased: 4&rarr;3.</p>

<p>I could fix it with WD40</p>

"talamcol","2022-01-07T10:14:40.25Z","LEGO damaging the reputation of Lamborghini","<p>I was very looking forward to this set as it looks stunning and the tech seemed to be awesome. However...</p>

<h2>Building experience</h2>

<p>I very enjoyed the first 3 boxes. After that, it is mostly panels. Especially disappointing are the doors. The manual says that a lot of work has gone into designing them and that they open as in the real car. Frankly, they are a joke. They are wobbly and don&#39;t stay in place. On the other hand, building the gearbox was a joy. Unfortunately, no tech is visible at the end. The gearbox is covered. The motor is covered, and the steering wheel is unusable.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the colours are a disaster. I have at least 10 different shades of green in all parts and there are even differences within the same tiles. I would have expected more from a 300$+ set.. And then there is the fact that it&#39;s lime green. Why is it lime green? The original Lamborghini is a far darker green and it is depicted a lot in the manual. But they just did something different. It does not look like they talked with each other nor does it look that they compared the finished set with the car.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>Yay there are prints! Besides that it&#39;s mostly panels and pins. But some cool exclusive parts are there too.</p>

<h2>Playability</h2>

<p>It&#39;s very fragile. So no, you cannot play with it. It&#39;s also not designed to be played. As already mentioned before, the wheels are too heavy so you cannot use the wheel. The tech is covered by panels, hence you can see nothing at all. The &quot;frunk&quot; opens (yay) but the bonnet does not. The doors are wobbly. I would recommend finishing the set and then never touch it again because it might break.</p>

<h2>Value</h2>

<p>The set would be fantastic for 100$ less. As such, it is too expensive for what it offers. I built far smaller sets with cooler parts that offer more.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>To summarise, I enjoyed the build. It looks awesome if you ignore the lime green and the colour differences. The box is cool. But the set is way too expensive! It&#39;s not worth it.</p>
",TRUE,3,4,4,1,2
"Gelu8","2023-04-11T15:37:37.617Z","Ignore The Green Elephant in the Room ","<p>This set was controversial. It had nothing to do with how it looked overall, how involved it was, or how large the price tag was. No, all that everyone was talking about was the colour. If you don&#39;t remember, once this set was released, it became apparent that some of the pieces were the wrong shade of green compared to other pieces. This was cause for concern and some people quickly looked to bash this set because of it.</p>

<p>And yet, if you just look past that one controversy, what you&#39;re left with is a fantastic set that was arguably the best large-scale Technic set made at the time. The Sian FKP 37 is a massive vehicle. It comes with an unboxing experience so cool, you need to experience it for yourself.</p>

<p>Building the car is a challenge. It&#39;ll probably take a long time, especially if you&#39;re not used to Technic. Throughout your building experience, you&#39;ll get to see how different parts of the car work together, see how gears move and how one section moves another. For someone who likes cars, it&#39;s a treat.</p>

<p>The finished set looks great. It&#39;s a striking model that&#39;s sure to draw eyes wherever you put it. When you&#39;re just giving it a quick glance, you don&#39;t notice the shades of green. That&#39;s the point. An offset colour here or there doesn&#39;t really matter. The set is good enough to make you forget about that and focus on the rest of it. It includes working suspension, working doors and steering, a working rear wing and a fully functional gearbox and engine. What more do you want in a car set?</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have this set and like cars, I&#39;d highly recommend picking it up. This is especially so if you want to build the other cars in this Technic line. For the more casual fan, it might be worth a look too.</p>
