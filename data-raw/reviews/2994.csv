"Novelty","2007-06-16T02:20:00.84Z","Carz","This little cart is basically a catapault mated to a cart.  The cart is well built and for a change it's great to have a catapault that not only have wheels but also a horse to pull it.  The not-so-great part is the catapault which is basically a barrel and a lever.  It could have been better.  The accessories in this set is nice, the flag gives the cart the character, there's a whip and a silver sword and a bat.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

However, all I had to do was call lego and inform them of the missing part and they sent one to me for free. That was excellent.</p>
<p>The set itself is great, with cool parts like the bat sheild and the hinged wagon/horse coupling. I still have all of the unique parts from this set, though I didn't quite realize it until I looked at this page.</p>
<p>Overall, it's a great set that I remember from my childhood.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"BobaFett2","2011-01-03T14:28:03.54Z","Good Fright Knights, but a bit bare","I got this set for a decent price off Craiglist, and it was worth it. The set isn't the best I've seen, but it's quite nice for 10 dollars.
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>I didn't get the box, so I can't say much about that. Sadly, there are no ideas/alternates at the end of the instructions.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a decent number of Minifigure accessories in the set-a spear, a lance, a dragon helmet, a normal helmet, a helmet plume (medium), a bat shield, and a chrome sword.&nbsp; There's also a joint piece for connecting the horse to the carriage. Lastly, are the two wheels-while not rare, they're certainly not common either.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>The two Minifigures are rather plain-I think the Knight could have more detail, but otherwise they aren't bad.<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>Simple-but it's small a small. The build is effective and stable.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is sturdy. It works-there's a catapult function. For some reason, there's a bat on the horse. Unfortunately, the cart has a looks a bit like a plank on wheels. and the end of the catapult looks odd. However, the first really improves the set, as does the large/small wheel contrast.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I rate this set a 3.5/4-its worth it if you like to collect Castle/Fright Knights, if you want some parts for a Castle carriage, or if you can get it for something around 6-9 dollars. Anything less is a bargain, anything more might be a bit too much. The Minifigures are plain, as is the build, but it's better than the over-juniorized Town Jr. sets from the same era.<br></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
"AETerry","2011-09-18T20:59:37.817Z","Bat Lord's Catapult Review","When the Fright Knights theme came out, LEGO was showing they were going to become more daring and adventurous with their sets and models. No longer would a Castle theme be just possible historical sets, but pull in elements of Fantasy now.<br><br>The Bat Lord's Catapult set is one of the smaller sets from this theme. Just by itself, you don't have any of the elements regarding fantasy with any dragons, ghosts, skeletons or magic involved. It's just a basic catapult being pulled by horse with two castle minifigures with it.<br><br>The set is alright, it tries for an innovative use of a barrel piece for the catapult. Yet with so many other catapult sets out there that I've seen over the years, it's not all that great, especially as there's no ammunition for it to fire.<br><br>The strong points to this set are getting a horse if you're short on LEGO horses and getting more Fright Knight figures to fill out an army with.<br><br>The set isn't bad, nor is it the best out there. I'd still pick it up if I was to redo purchase considerations as I'd want the Fright Knight theme and filling out an army.<br>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T16:18:37.933Z","Fright Nights Raid the Castle","<p>Set #6027 Bat Lord's Catapult: The Fright Nights sub-theme of the Castle theme was a gem among gems back in the day, it offered up a unique new brand of enemy for the generic knights of old to battle against and gave rise to the birth of the Black Dragon creature piece, if I'm not mistaken it also introduced the Lego Bat.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This small priced set was designed to offer up a fun little assault vehicle to add to your army of Fright Knights. The set came with two mini-figures, a black horse, a black bat, the silver broadsword (thank you... Man I've reviewed enough sets by now and I finally remember what type of sword it is.) as well as the evil looking embossed shield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building the Bat Lord's Catapult takes relatively no time at all, three minutes tops unless you've memorized the instructions for it. The Catapult doesn't launch mere bricks either, it has fire topped missiles to breach the walls of the castle. The launching gimmick can fire them a fair distance too. (Not that I've launched any recently.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an avid collector of LEGO Castle I also enjoy anything that can be bought cheaply and in significant numbers to swell the ranks of your armies. I have to improvise these days with alternative colored pieces since I lost some of the original ones, but it still looks great and holds up rather nicely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I recommend this set to anyone building an army of Fright Knights, it has huge potential play value and looks great displayed next to the Bat Lord and the Fright Knights. (One of these days I'll have a larger Fright Knight set to include in my display.)</p>",TRUE,5,3,3,4,3
