<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pi&ntilde;ata Kid comes with the short legs in dark blue, which is nothing new or exclusive by any means. The torso is one of my biggest disappointments with the figure and it&rsquo;s because his torso is just plain white, sorely lacking torso printing, front and back. They could&rsquo;ve so easily printed something like a Mexican style skull on there or literally anything, I mean, they didn&rsquo;t even bother giving it dual-molded arms. The reason for the lack of torso printing is obviously because the poncho cloth pieces cover it, and I guess it wasn&rsquo;t exactly a huge deal because of that but I still wish Lego put more effort and didn&rsquo;t cheap out. 2 Poncho cloth pieces are attached to the figure by the neck and I actually really like the design of these with yellow, coral, black and green, it&lsquo;s a very nice unique design and very colorful and I guess they do make up for the lack of torso print. His face print was a new one for an open smile expression (presumably for when he finally beats open the pi&ntilde;ata!) and I liked getting more child faces, this was a nice one. I wish he had a blindfolded alternate face, but the sombrero piece couldn&rsquo;t allow it unfortunately. His sombrero piece is a new design in a nougat color and with a new pattern printed around it, I always like getting new designs for the sombrero piece, but I think that at this point, Lego should really make a new hair/hat combo with it (that would&rsquo;ve allowed for the blindfolded alternate face I mentioned earlier). I don&rsquo;t actually have problems with the piece itself, the hair/hat combo is just a suggestion and something I&rsquo;d like to see in the future. Finally, his accessories are a stick to whack the pi&ntilde;ata and the actual pi&ntilde;ata piece, the stick is nothing too special as always and they give you an extra of it. The pi&ntilde;ata is an AMAZING new piece, this pi&ntilde;ata represents a burro (donkey) and it&rsquo;s really colorful with blue (on the nose, ears and tail), purple, orange and pink colors found all around it. There&rsquo;s also a stud on top of the piece and the whole design spans 3 studs. I loved getting this piece and just buy it off BrickLink if you have no Interest in the figure.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, even though I have problems with the figure itself, I still think it&rsquo;s mostly a good figure and it was better than my initial expectations. Pi&ntilde;ata Kid unfortunately does fall into the trap where the accessory outshines the actual figure, something shared with pretty much most of the figures from series 20. The pi&ntilde;ata piece is obviously the main reason a lot of people are gonna get this figure for, but I&rsquo;d still say that the overall package is good and I recommend getting him since he&rsquo;s one of the better figures of the series.</p>

After this series we would start to see a different take on CMF releases with less figures per series. Four less to be precise.</p>

<p>Pinata Boy is a bang up addition to child Minifigures, the hat is a nice touch with an excellent print for an older piece and the little Pinata element is a great new piece with some charming functionality. To date it has yet to be introduced in any LEGO sets proper with different colours, which is a shame as I would like to see more Pinata to populate LEGO displays. He has no printing on his torso or legs, in stead a large cloth wrap covers the plain white torso.</p>

<p>Overall this is a brilliant offering from LEGO and I wholeheartedly recommend tracking it down if you missed out on the fun.</p>
