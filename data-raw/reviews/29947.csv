"Watsonite","2020-11-18T18:21:54.75Z","Classic as classic gets... with a green tarnish","<p>I buy more Lego than I build. Mostly due to space restrictions. But sometimes a certain set simply begs for not being shelved until whenever.</p>

<p>Space Rover Explorer is such a set. I&#39;m not always convinced of the quality of the Creator line but once in a while, they hit all the right spots. This is one of those sets I decided upon buying the minute I saw it being announced.</p>

<p>Building Space Rover Explorer does a great job at bringing back the older look and feel of Lego. The build has lots of variation, nice parts and colour scheme and it is just about &#39;building Lego&#39;. No&nbsp;fiddling or the (god forbid) greebling alley Lego has been lost in&nbsp;over the last decade, but just plain and simple building.</p>

<p>The vehicle evokes classic space in its design and in its construction and the colour scheme update is fresh and pleasant. Also, the wheel bogeys are nicely designed and perfectly functioning. The minifigure is wonderful but it is a bit sad for being&nbsp;just alone. Space missions need more travellers. For safety, you know.</p>

<p>But... why did they add the atrocious green alien? Not only is it ugly, unstable and too big, it simply doesn&#39;t fit with the style of the set. Where the Rover itself tries to invoke the adventurous semi-realistic style, the alien by far isn&#39;t. I know we can&#39;t tell if this is a semi-realistic depiction of an alien but, c&#39;mon, really...?</p>

<p>So, buy the set, enjoy the build and admire the result. And just throw those green bricks into your large pile of bricks. Who knows they might come in handy... whenever.</p>

By LEGO&rsquo;s standards, it is relatively realistic, and appears to have been inspired by NASA rovers. Mr_Cross has noted the similarity to a NASA prototype of its two-person Lunar Electrical Rover in his review, but the celebrated Mars rovers Spirit and Opportunity also come to mind.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The astronaut minifigure bears a classic Space logo on his chest, but 31107&rsquo;s remembrance of classic Space appears more symbolic than substantive. I would be hard-pressed to articulate any specific stylistic attributes reminiscent of classic space, except possibly the self-consciously &ldquo;bricky&rdquo; construction, characteristic of the Creator line as a whole. As the rare adult fan not enamored of classic Space, I don&#39;t find the minifigure particularly interesting; certainly I would have preferred a female astronaut. The upcoming 31111 includes what looks to be a robot in the same uniform.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>The rover&rsquo;s construction</b></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">About two thirds of the way through construction today, I realized that I was constructing a submersible with wheels, with a massive bubble window in the front, a pair of graspers, and a sealed body that tapers off towards the back. Given the bed in the rear of the rover, one could equally well describe it as a space caravan. To my mind, 31107 draws its vocabulary as much from these sources as anything extraterrestrial, with the possible exception of the undercarriage.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The six-wheel bogie suspension is similar to that used by NASA, for instance on the Mars rovers, and it functions effectively on uneven surfaces. It&rsquo;s an impressive feature during play, and lends the rover much of its &ldquo;Space&rdquo; feel. The bogie could be more accurate to NASA&rsquo;s design, and could use a higher clearance&mdash;currently the rover can&rsquo;t clear even a single brick&mdash;but these changes would entail trade-offs (instability, a preponderance of Technic pieces), and I agree that the current design is likely the best available without a significantly more complex design.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Other aspects of the rover&rsquo;s design are similarly impressive. The door that passes for an airlock elegantly re-purposes a bay window. The rover&rsquo;s roof rack can house the little autonomous rover. There are innumerable things to position and remove&mdash;arms, a folding crane, lights, a communications array, tanks of what look to be oxygen and fuel, tools&mdash;offering many possibilities for play. Changes in design and color as one moves from back to front emphasize the different functions and areas of the rover: the chunky viewing area for exploration; the cabin-like center for habitation; the smaller, grey, industrial area for maintenance and support. These contribute to the rover&rsquo;s complex character.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">LEGO have prioritized accessibility of the interior, and with both the front and the rear of the rover removed one can reach every part of the cabin and play with the minifigure. Inside the cabin, I particularly like the microscope, cleverly composed of an Erling brick and a pair of binoculars.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal""><b>All the other bits</b></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">31107&rsquo;s other elements&mdash;the small autonomous rover, and the lime space creature&mdash;are equally outstanding, not to mention cute. The design of the small rover imitates that of the larger: they share six wheels, arms in the front, satellite dishes, and pairs of blue transparent eyes mounted above the body. I find the creature highly endearing, with its poseable tentacles and plant shoots-cum-eye stalks, and reasonably stable. By manipulating the tentacles and opening and closing the mouth a surprising degree of affects are possible. As has been noted in another review, the astronaut lacks a colleague, but I like to think that the lime creature keeps him company.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The three reviews of 31107 currently available on Brickset inadvertently indicate, I think, one of the reasons for this set&rsquo;s success: it has something for everyone. Mr_Cross was drawn by the minifigure; Watsonite praises the rover but dislikes the creature; my eye was caught first by the creature, and only then did I notice the excellence of the rest of the set. Its heterogeneity is a strength. An industrial quality is balanced by playfulness; the tentacled whimsy of the creature complements the angular realism of the rover.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">31107 offers a compelling main build, great functionality and play potential, and a strong measure of the capricious creativity that defines LEGO at its best, not to mention excellent value. Not classic Space, but nonetheless a classic design. Five stars.</span></span></span></p>
