"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-22T08:59:07Z","Average set for it's size","The only reason I bought this set was because it came with a dark grey bat! but it also comes with some other unsung heros in it aswell. The minifig is great and the set comes with two weapons. It also comes with a treasure chest but NO TREASURE!! just two little transparent yellow pieces. The cart is a little akward aswell, whenever you try to take off the chest from the cart somtimes one of those little red pieces conecting it to the cart comes off with it which gets anoying after awile but the set does come with some good pieces! Other than that it's an alright little set and I'd give it 1 thumb up (out of two)!",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-11-14T06:00:07.03Z","Treasure Transporter","Found this one in pieces today, so I built it and thought it could have a review too. The model and mini-fig are quite basic in this set. The cart is simply a couple of boards with wheels. It has a treasure chest in the middle filled with blue and yellow clear 1x1 circles. On the end are two weapons, a sword and a spear. The cart also comes with a gray bat.

The mini-fig has gray pants and a black, dragon like helmet and top. He also has armor painted onto his top. The face is standard with goatee and eyebrows.

Overall it is a very standard model and I really can't think of any more to say about it . I feel it's rating is a 5/10 or average as it has nothing special but no faults either. If you don't have this one in your collection don't stress but if your a castle  fan this one is worth getting for your collection as it is that little bit different again.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

This is small, but the pieces are useful, like the treasures, used in some themes, pirates, western ,or in the castle. This is a good cart of castle theme, have the wheels for castle, don't very cool for city. The minifgigure is great, don't have the helmet of a fright knight but is one of them. Good in overall, i rate this 5/5, the size isn't important.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
