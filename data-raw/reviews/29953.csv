The build is quite easy and contained at least one surprising building technique. The instruction is kept in black, but for the most parts the colours are still distinguishable (except for dark brown of course).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Some colours on the inside are very off. I will never understand the pink pieces.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>While the tile on the stand is printed. The eyes are sadly stickers. I have stickers on my old fireboat that get their 30th anniversary, but I doubt Lego&#39;s quality today. Even in this set the dark red is not always dark red.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pros</p>

<p>+ The design is fantastic</p>

<p>+ Dark red and gold are really cool colours</p>

<p>+ Easy to build even with the dark instruction</p>

<p>+ For an IP theme rather few stickers</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cons</p>

<p>- Stickers for the eyes, but prints for the stand?</p>

<p>- Pink plates at places where they are not needed. I would have preferred a proper colour here and a printed piece for the eyes. This would have been cheaper in logistics I think.</p>

<p>- Price, around 45 USD is expensive but okayish, I payd 40 Euro. For a 60 USD Set the head is remarkably tiny.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Conlcusion:</p>

<p>Overall, I give the set still a 4 star rating, since it just looks so damn good, besides its small size and the small failures it has.</p>
