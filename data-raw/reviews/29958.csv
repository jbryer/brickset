<strong>Model</strong><br />
Is is rather big comparing to the rest of magazine gifts. Overall it is quite good model of that ship, but not the best. Wings look good, has good shape and coloring, can be lift up, to imitate the battle mode. Attaching point looks weak, and need some improvement. Body is a bit to squareish but in this scale it could be hard to round it a bit. It is also too long for this scale. Dome at the back looks great, especially considering fact, that the stud can mimic engine of craft. The front at the other hand is too big. In original, it should be more flat, it could be better to use dish instead of dome. The ingot at the top is a fine detail, but totally out of&nbsp;place. It is there to give a subtle impression of roundness.<br />
At the first glance, the model is nice and good-looking, but when you care about details, then you find many flaws.</p>

<strong>Parts</strong><br />
Parts are great. Wing parts are always worthy, and here are they in four different sizes. Especially worth noticing is a pair of black 2x2 with cut corner. Also, clear dome and gray ingot are nice additions.</p>

<strong>Summary</strong><br />
It&#39;s not so good set, one of the weakest of magazine gifts. Parts are good, model look ok, but is lacking many details. It is one of the very few MG that has actual moving feature, but it doesn&#39;t add anything to its value. It is worth buying if you are in need of those parts, but I encourage you to wait for a promo, because it isn&#39;t worth $4.</p>
