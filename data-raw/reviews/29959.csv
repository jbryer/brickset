<p>Issue 4 of the Hidden Side Comic gives us Douglas Elton, aka El Fuego.&nbsp; The issue was available in the UK between 8th January and 4th February 2020 and was priced &pound;3.99.&nbsp; Being the fourth issue of this line of comic it is no surprise that this is El Fuego&#39;s first appearance.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>A large image of El Fuego appears on the front of the packet and it clearly shows that he comes with a fire extinguisher and a small flame build.&nbsp; A couple of ghosts a pictured behind him, as is the Newbury High School (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70425-1/Newbury-Haunted-High-School"">70425</a>).&nbsp; In the bottom right it states that this is for 6+, which as ever seems a little on the high side as my six-year-old and his friends love this theme and would have had no problem building these comic sets&nbsp;when they were younger.</p>

<p>The back has a nice image of Jack and Parker on the flap of the foil packet adjacent to the Hidden Side logo.&nbsp; The standard safety information is also provided and the 1:1 image is one of the flame elements in Transparent Bright Orange.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>El Fuego is almost perfect and appears as he does in the El Fuego&#39;s Stunt Truck set (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70421-1/El-Fuego-s-Stunt-Truck"">70421</a>), albeit without the cape here.&nbsp; The torso and legs appear in a couple of other sets too, and he appears with a ghost head in the JB&#39;s Ghost Lap set (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70418-1/J-B-s-Ghost-Lab"">70418</a>).&nbsp; There is no hair element, so he has to keep his printed helmet on.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>This set is all about the minifigure, although you get five other parts that build two accessories.&nbsp; Firstly is his fire extinguisher which is built in the same way they have been for years.&nbsp; This version mixes Bright Red and White elements.&nbsp; You also get a Transparent Bright Orange parts to make a flame section.&nbsp; No parts stand out as anything other than standard, with the exception of the printed parts that make El Fuego.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>This is a great way to add El Fuego to your collection if you only wanted the characters.&nbsp; I would have liked to have had the hair element added, after all&nbsp;the ghost from issue 2 had two heads.&nbsp; Also, very much like the Fireman from the City Comic (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/951902-1/Fireman"">951902</a>) the inclusion of a stud launcher instead of the fire extinguisher would have added play value.&nbsp; His cape could also have been added, but for me that is not really necessary.</p>

<p>This is a good bright minifigure, and with the comic and set combined at the &pound;3.99 price it is fantastic value.&nbsp; A slight change and one extra part could have improved this.&nbsp; Again however this set cannot be used with the app.</p>
