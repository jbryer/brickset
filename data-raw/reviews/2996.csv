You get a Fright Knight mini figure, a bat, old fashion wagon wheels, treasure chest with treasure. If there had been more than one in the store I would have bought more. A bunch of good items at a great price if you can still find it anywhere.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-07-16T06:08:15.81Z","Hand held","This set is typical of any other small cart, but modified for the Fright Knights.  There's a knight, a cart which just fits a treasure chest filled with round bricks and some weapons.  The design of the cart is pretty standard - there are no embellishment on the cart.  The treasure could have been better - pirates had golden coins during this time so I don't see why castle couldn't use those coins as well.  The inclusion of the bat seems weird as well, but it could be because there's some play value in it.",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0
