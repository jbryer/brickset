<p>A motorbike and yet another policeman is provided with Issue 23 of the Lego City Comic.&nbsp; You don&#39;t get any additional sets attached, but as ever the set relates to the story within the comic.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The front of the foil packet shows the motorbike and has a very nice nighttime scene in the background that shows a police plane and helicopter.&nbsp; The motorbike seems to be racing along a high speed road to arrest the crook from Issue 1 in 2017 as we are still yet to have another to go with him and this is the eighth police set on the front of comics!</p>

<p>The back has the standard safety information and a 1:1 scale image of the handcuffs above the set number.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>We are this time istroduced to Harry Holdem, which is all he can really do on his motorbike if he does catch any crooks.&nbsp; This particular minifigure only appears in one other set (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60244-1/Police-Helicopter-Transport"">60244</a>).&nbsp; The helmet and legs are very common, his head has appeared in 21 other sets since 2012 and the torso was first introduced in 2019 and can be found in a total of ten&nbsp;sets, including this one.</p>

<p>The minifigure suits the set perfectly, but once again I think Lego need to add an extra one for the playability.&nbsp; If you only collected the comics your 8 police would outnumber the single crook!</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>The motorbike is built in six steps, but you don&#39;t really need instructions to put this together as it is very standard.&nbsp; No parts jump out as special, although the fairing in white has only appeared in six police sets, and each time with a sticker.&nbsp; This time there is no sticker or print so the motorbike must be an undercover one.&nbsp; If Lego can print on the green fairing from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60255-1/Stunt-Team"">60255</a> there is no reason they can&#39;t for this.&nbsp; There are two varieties of stickers, but even printing the 2020 version would cover this and the three police sets it also appears in.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>I do like the set, but it could so easily be improved with one extra minifigure or even a little printing.&nbsp; I understand that costs need to be limited and it&#39;s great to get a bike, but it&#39;s only been a few issues since the exact same piece, but in red, was on the front of the comic, so&nbsp;a little variation would be appreciated.</p>

<p>With the comic only having one set on the front the price in the UK dropped back to &pound;4.25, which is great&nbsp;value - especially with Collectable Minifigures now being sold at &pound;3.50, so that works out as &pound;0.75 for a motorbike and a comic!</p>

<p>The next set will be a Fireman with a drone.</p>
