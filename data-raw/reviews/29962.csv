<p>It is amazing for this newbie to understand how much time and effort and planning went into designing this kit and all the others to create the detail and working parts.&nbsp;&nbsp; And for myself, to enjoy building and displaying the finished results.&nbsp;&nbsp; Would recommend this kit as a great build for an adult builder or a younger builder that wants to step up their game.&nbsp;&nbsp; Wonderful display piece and a great feeling to know that I built it.</p>
