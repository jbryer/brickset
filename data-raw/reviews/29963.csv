Rebooted!","<p>Ninjago: Rebooted is one of my favourite seasons of the show so when the magazine containing updated versions of two minifigures from that season shown up in stores I picked it up right away. And unlike some of the other Legacy figs, these are direct remakes of the original designs! Anyway, let&#39;s get to the actual review.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>The packaging of this set is very similar to the typical battle pack sets exclusive to the LEGO stores (<a aria-describedby=""ui-tooltip-1"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40342-1/Ninjago-Minifigure-Pack"">40342</a>, for example). On the front you can see some nice action shots of Cole and the Nindroid Drone. There is nothing on the back.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions and building experience</strong></p>

<p>The building process was fairly simple, for the minifigures at least. Unfortunately, these are no instructions included in the magazine, so I had to build Cole&#39;s hammer based on the picture on the packaging. For people who aren&#39;t as experienced as I am, they may have some problems. Besides that, the set wasn&#39;t difficult to assemble. It took me less than a minute.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>For a small magazine gift set, we have some very nice pieces. There is Cole&#39;s newer&nbsp;hair from the LEGO Ninjago Movie, which we haven&#39;t seen in any set since&nbsp;<a aria-describedby=""ui-tooltip-0"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70657-1"">70657</a>. We also have the return of the 2014 mask piece and the axe head, which hasn&#39;t appeared in any Ninjago sets lately. The most interesting piece is arguably the Nindroid&#39;s head, which only comes in this set and in&nbsp;<a aria-describedby=""ui-tooltip-5"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40374-1/Golden-Zane-Accessory-Set"">40374</a>. It&#39;s the same as the Nindroid heads from the normal Legacy sets but without an alternate face.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>In this magazine gift we get two new Legacy minifigures: Legacy Rebooted/Tournament of Elements Cole and a Legacy Nindroid Drone.</p>

<p>This version of Cole is a remake of the Rebooted suit from 2014 and it definitely looks like it&#39;s predecessor. Cole keeps the colour scheme consisting of black, gold and orange, but replaces the gray with dark tan. He also now has bare arms, which is meant to resemble his 2015 variant. However, besides his head, symbol and colours, he is basically a clone of the other Legacy 2020 ninja. Speaking of his symbol, it&#39;s actually been redesigned a bit and it has probably changed the most from the original compared to the rest of his team. Cole&nbsp;has the same hairpiece as the one from the LNM sets and underneath his Rebooted mask, he has two face expressions: one angry and one smiling. This Cole is pretty rare, since he only comes in this set and in&nbsp;<a aria-describedby=""ui-tooltip-0"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71699-1"">71699</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Cole&#39;s opponent&nbsp;in this set is a generic Nindroid Drone. While he isn&#39;t too interesting, he still has some intricate details on his torso and head and looks pretty good. Unfortunately, much like his 2014 version, he still doesn&#39;t have any leg printing. Unlike the 2014 version, he also has no printing on the back of his head. However, it&#39;s always nice to get some more Nindroids. Nindroid Drone also comes in&nbsp;<a aria-describedby=""ui-tooltip-2"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40374-1/Golden-Zane-Accessory-Set"">40374</a>, which is a LEGO store exclusive set, making him a bit rarer than Cole.</p>

<p>Both Cole and the Nindroid Drone have one weapon each. Cole has another giant hammer, which is disappointing, since we have gotten Cole minifigures with big hammers a lot of times in magazines before. I would have liked if he maybe had his green hot-dog from the Thunder Raider set. Still, at least it has some cool parts, like the transparent orange pyramid pieces.</p>

<p>Nindroid Drone has a chainsaw axe thingy with a nice bright red lightsaber handle.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>There are no play features in this set. The only things that you could play with are the minifigures. I mean, you could have Cole fight the Nindroid with his imaginary Techno Blade, but it&#39;s not much.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Ultimately, this all comes down to whatever you want the Legacy 2 Cole and Nindroid minifigures. If you already have them, this magazine gift is an easy pass. But, if you don&#39;t have them, it&#39;s a great, cheap way to get them. Although it&#39;s not available in stores anymore, you can easily find it on Blicklink for less than 6 bucks in new condition, which is a fantastic price for two minifigures. And even if you already have their previous versions from 2014, these are very solid upgrades and are&nbsp;way more detailed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, if you happen to find this one for a cheap price, go for it. It&#39;s a very good magazine gift set.</p>
