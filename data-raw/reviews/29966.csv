The heart on the panda is 1 piece and fits the build nicely. I received it for free at a Lego shop/store last year for just visiting on Valentine&#39;s Day. It isn&#39;t worth much as most of the pieces are common, but it still looks good on display. It isn&#39;t great for play as it has no articulation, but I imagine children could still play with it.</p>

<p>Overall a nice polybag and would recommend it to people who like bears and people who just want it for display.</p>
