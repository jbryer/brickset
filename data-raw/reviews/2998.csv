"A_Brickset_user","2004-09-20T17:37:12Z","The first catapult","The catapult included in this set is a little blocky but works well and is fun to build.  It comes with two of the ever popular falcon warriors as well.  I find the grey wheels (I believe they are originally from the technic sets) to be a little inclined to get stuck and they don't look quite as nice as the brown &quot;wagon wheels&quot;",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-04-03T07:11:36.77Z","Whachamacallit","This catapult is good for a first attempt, although it looks as if someone ripped out part of a cathedral and attached wheels to it.  The catapult itself actually works great and is probably one that would throw the same brick the furthest.  The design itself is sturdy, but there are bits and bobs here and there that is a bit puzzling.  For starters, are those yellow parts on the side of the catapult suppose to represent lights... or are they placeholders for extra missiles?  Or how would one move such a contraption - shouldn't there be a location to attach a horses' harness to the machine?",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-10-09T12:30:02.733Z","Works perfectly","This catapult can throw the yellow round bricks really far! It works very well and is ideal to attack a castle. You get four round yellow bricks as ammunition. Not sufficient for a long battle, but the catapult works fine with any bricks that are about the size of the round bricks included. You get two soldiers with two swords, two spears and two very rare round shields. I also like the technic wheels instead of the wheels which are used for carriages. The wheels used for carriages would make the catapult too high. Apart from that, brown or black carrige wheels wouldn't look so good on it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-08T14:58:37.483Z","Well made catapult","One of the first catapults, this is from the Black Falcon theme. This is greater than some catapults, and the shots aren't big. But these are also great for a double shooting. This catapult have also some pieces of technic themes and another useful things like the flags and the colors in the set. The color scheme is great and combine with the two soldiers included in it, to makes the catapult launchs or be defended. The falcon knights have the same face, helmet and some details, turning a great thing to play with armies of these. The yellow piece that can be shooted can be guarded on it too. Another itens are also spears and the circular shape shield, that the knights hangs. The system that is made the catapult is well made and includes technic pieces. Technic pieces in this are common, like the wheels and it's base. Technic, castle and system pieces are all useful. The wheels aren't very used more, but still cool for carts, chariots and some other things. This isn't a great set, due to it have few pieces. But all these are useful, and as a lego fan, i like useful sets, they can makes different sets, or armies of minifigures, weaponry for these, buildings, vehicles and more. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This was my first catapult set. 

The set is very good and sturdy. The range of the catapult is great and its works very well. You get two armored minifigs along that can protect or activate the catapult. 

Overall, great set with a lot of playability.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Catapult build is really built I think like the actual Catapult seige weapons that could be rolled into place to attack a Castle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some Technic Pieces are incorporated into the design, giving a little bit more complexity and ability for the set to function. 2 Black Falcon Minifigures who each have a round shield, sword and spear. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all these years, this sets best features are being a Classic of Lego. I bought a second set off E-Bay a few years to get spare parts and try to keep this set and others together. Or least be able to build the model when I want to.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,5,3

<p><b>Ye Minifigures:</b></p>

<p>There be two in Black Falcon uniform of classical varieties, one beareth a brown spear, the other beareth a blade. Both possess a most worthy circular shield.</p>
</div>

<div><b>Thy&nbsp;Plan Of Attack</b><br />
Their efforts were great and through tenacity they built a siege catapult, a weapon that the Lion Kingdom possessed not. It fired erm... yellow rocks of which it heldeth four. The black helmeted guards who did worketh on this contraption were furnished with ye finest classic circular shields, lest they be struck down by arrows of ye olde Lion Kingdom.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Armed with sword and spear, these blackguards, like carrion of the battlefield gave no quarter in their relentless clawing at the kingdom, most splendid flags of white and green blowing in the winds of war.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>Such interesting and varied parts were counted to make such a war machine, of particular interest the wheels, intended as metal or stone did completeth such a Raven themed dealer of death with its sturdy black made structure and working technical component firing arm. Its dark ammo bucket was a most pleasing addition to the would be siege lord who could rain his hatred and wrath down upon any he did go forth against.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><b>Thy Epilogue</b><br />
And so, this most excellent machine did pleaseth many with its hail of death and destruction (well at least four shots before thine enemy were kind enough to returneth the ammo) and brought dark times to the Lion King and his folk, many years ago.</div>

"Khanivor","2018-07-14T07:29:02.417Z","Catapult begat Siege Tower of Obliteration","<p>This set was the genesis of a years long fascination with siege engines in my younger days. To have a working Lego catapult with which to tear down the extra walls that had been built up to protect the grounds of&nbsp;the castle opened up a whole new field of battle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Over the next year this inspiration would lead to my first real MOCs; giant siege towers. Using all the black bricks I could rip from other sets and strengthened with copious amounts of Technics my team of builders - well, Chris and myself - reached a height which could scale any wall in the real world. Well, if they a little under three feet tall. Yes, it was a behemoth, kitted our with all the extras an invading force could need, like stables, an armory, hospital and platforms for catapults.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It was the zenith of my Lego creativity and could never have existed if not for the direction that this catapult set placed me on.&nbsp;</p>
