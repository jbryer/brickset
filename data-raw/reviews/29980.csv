"mini_mads1980","2020-06-27T22:26:36.603Z","Poorest Fire Outing for the City Comic","<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>This is the fourth Fire outing for the Lego City Comic.&nbsp; Bobby McBright appears in this particular issue, and is possibly the second time we have seen him.&nbsp; This issue was on sale between 19th February 2020 and 17th March 2020.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The packet shows the drone flying whilst being controlled by Bobby.&nbsp; In the background there is a fire helicopter that does not appear to be based on any retail set.&nbsp; On the back the 1:1 image has one of the propeller blades, which is too big for the box and looks quite good as it bursts from the page.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Bobby, in this exact configuration, appears in this set and the GWP 30361: Fire ATV.&nbsp; Therefore, if you missed out on the GWP then this could have been the best way of getting the Minifigure.&nbsp; It&#39;s bound to appear as a secondary set on the front of the comic in the future, so don&#39;t despair if you haven&#39;t got him yet.</p>

<p>The torso appears in 21 sets and legs 26, so would be easy to source should you wish.&nbsp; The red hat is new in the last couple of years but again readily available.&nbsp; Bobby&#39;s head too is very common and has appeared in a few of the City themes since 2017, including Issue 4 of the City Comic as a Fireman!</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>This is a very poor build and adds nothing to the Minifigure in my view.&nbsp; The drone you get with Series 20 of the Collectable Minifigures would have been a great addition, but sadly this is made up of 11 pieces that you need to be told is a drone.&nbsp; But for the colour scheme you would struggle to link it to the City Fire line.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>It&#39;s fair to say that this is by far my least favourite of the City Fire sets attached to the City Comic.&nbsp; To date we have had four, and the last one (951905) was pretty bad - only saved as it had the first female Minifigure for the Comic line contained in it.</p>

<p>The only reason to get this would be for Bobby McBright, who appears to have switched role at the Fire Department.</p>

<p>I scored the overall as 2 purely to take into consideration the value for money, and that is only because you get the comic and two sets for &pound;4.99.&nbsp; However, the additional set for me was 951910 which I only scored 2 as well.&nbsp; Therefore, if you missed this issue you have not really missed anything.&nbsp; Also, the sets don&#39;t compliment each other in play value, but always nice to get more Lego, so I gave it an extra point.</p>

<p>The next issue will feature a new construction set with a nice looking bulldozer and I look forward to it.</p>
