"StanSUeScotty","2020-07-22T16:25:48.52Z","Very disappointed with the loose connection","<p>People who want to buy this set are mostly for the minifig, and maybe for the printed New York plate as well. The printings are excellent, and the value, not very nice but still acceptable, 5 bucks for a minifig, a plate, a magnetic lego brick.</p>

<p>Buuuuuuuuuuuuuut, there&#39;s one HUGE drawback for this minifig: the connection between the upper and lower bodies is soooo loose. Every time I tried to turn her arm a bit for a better angle,&nbsp;the body was&nbsp;separated.</p>

<p>It&#39;s perfect for display, but very annoying with the loose body.&nbsp;And if you do stick it onto the fridge door as a &quot;magnet,&quot;&nbsp;some day I bet you&#39;ll find a Statue of Half Liberty&nbsp;lol...</p>

<p>I&#39;m very disappointed because before I get this set I think it&#39;s&nbsp;perfect, but the loose parts just&nbsp;ruined my expectation.</p>

"one79","2020-12-25T16:58:24.88Z","For those of you that miss the Lady Liberty Minifigure","<p>I bought two sets of 854031 - Statue of Liberty Magnet from LEGO Certified Store (LCS) Indonesia. I had wanted this because I did not have Lady Liberty minifigure from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8827-4/Lady-Liberty"">Minifigure Series 6 (8827)</a> and it seems the minifigure from this magnet looks similar with the series 6.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The information on this set stated that this magnet consists of 11 parts. After disassembly, we can see clearly the 11 parts. Seven parts are used for the minifigure, one part for the magnet section with a 4 x 4 studs, two normal parts and one special tile with &ldquo;NEW YORK&rdquo; text printed on top of it. This special tile can be utilised by those of you who like to construct custom LEGO&reg; such as MOC building. You can also use the Lady Liberty minifigure for any purposes you see fit in your MOC.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>One important thing that need to be mentioned is that the magnet part is not a brick itself. It only has studs on the top but it does not have tubes at the bottom to connect this part to studs as shown on the photo below. It has solid bottom because it needs to house the magnet securely. Therefore, you can not re-purpose the magnet part as a brick.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>Well, I might be biased, but I like it so much. It must be because I am looking for this for my LEGO city setup.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Only 11 pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Well, I do not see many options how you can play this with, maybe place it directly on the fridge or utilise the minifigure for MOC. The printed tile is a nice addition too.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>It cost peanuts if it is bought in Europe or US. The reason I am saying lthis is because in Indonesia the price of this magnet is more than double&nbsp;from the price in Europe or US. But for Indonesian that is looking for <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8827-4/Lady-Liberty"">Lady Liberty from the minifigure series 6</a>, getting this magnet set is a lot cheaper.</p>

<p><strong>Special Note</strong></p>

<p>I agree with the other reviewer that the connection between the torso and the bottom part is a bit loose even though I am located in Indonesia. I am guessing they all come from the same factory or the same mould.</p>

<p>Please note that I write this review based on my own LEGO Blog article which is available from:&nbsp;<a href=""https://indobrickville.com/main/review-lego-854031"">https://indobrickville.com/main/review-lego-854031</a></p>

<p>I hope this insight from me will be useful for all AFOLs out there!</p>
