<p>The child can go into his floating crib, or&nbsp;he can stand out of the crib. The child has a big head like all the&nbsp;Brickheadz. His head is in the color sand green he has big eyes and big ears that can go up or own.&nbsp;His dress or shirt is in the color dark tan. On the sides of his shirt he has little arms.</p>

<h2><strong>The Mandalorian</strong></h2>

<p>The Mandalorian has a dark bluish grey helmet that has almost no studs showing so it is smooth. On the sides of the helmet there are places that you can put an antenna on but it is not in this set. On the back of his helmet there are some grill pieces for detail. The Mandalorian&#39;s body is mostly brown and tan. He has a belt&nbsp;with some things on it. His lest arm is brown and his right arm is half light tan and half light blue. Just below the left arm are some lightsaber hilt pieces, I don&#39;t know what they are for, but they are a nice detail. On the back there is a cape with the Mandalorian&#39;s weapon on it.</p>

<h2><strong>My opinions</strong></h2>

<p>In my opinion this is a good set for the price. It is one of the best Brickheadz sets. It has a good&nbsp;build and I would recommend it.</p>

<p>The Building Experience is quite ok, nothing fancy or new but solid for approx. half an hour.</p>

<p>The Colors and Forms are very nice and i have to say that even if it was 20 Euro i don&#39;t regret the buy for those two Figures.</p>

"philip_dt","2023-01-06T18:00:38.99Z","Impressed by First Brickhead","<p>I got these as an unexpected Christmas present from my children. As you can tell from the title, these are my first Brickheadz.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not generally a fan of how Brickheadz look and, as a rabid completionist, I also avoid &quot;collections&quot;. As a result, I have never paid much attention to them.</p>

<p>But building the Mandalorian was a genuinely great experience. I had no real idea of how it was going to come together at the end, and it was a real pleasure to see it unfold. I&#39;m sure the clever brick combinations are quite typical to most of these sets but as this was my first, I really appreciated it.</p>

<p>I also really like the finished build, I think the subject fits the style well.</p>

<p>As for Baby Yoda... meh... I haven&#39;t even bothered to build the flying toilet; an exceptionally ugly collection of bricks. The Child itself is pretty nicely rendered, but the build wasn&#39;t all that fun.</p>

<p>On a final note... if you ever wanted a good supply of parts to build stud-free finishes, these must be a god-send. You can call me a cynic but no wonder they sell so well.</p>

<p>As a Mandolorian fan that appreciates Lego, this was a great gift.</p>

<p>The mandalorian and the child are immensely popular characters so it was inevitable that there would be brickheadz and it turned out to be my first one .</p>

<p>The builds-</p>

<p>Starting with mando ; his helmet is in a dark grey colour with sloping at the front and top , the back is fairly flat and just attributes some grilled texture , the sides have the attachment spot for a range finder on each side , the visor is built with a black slope and a very interesting technique to get the t shape , the chest has armour plating represented by 1&times;1 corner tiles , the belt has a tiled build with a binocular price for extra detail , the side harm wields a blaster and features a 1&times;2 printed cheese slope , the other arm is very plain with an unprinted 1&times;2 cheese slope , the back has a very nice flowing cape with his rifle attached , the legs are very plain an lack detail apart from some&nbsp; teeth and lightsaber hilt elements . The child has his pod with consists of some big round elements underneath , some corner round elements at the back , both sides are identical and both use 1&times;1 corner tiles for accuracy , moving on to the child his body is tiled front and back , his arms use sand green clips for hands , the collar is accurately thicker , the face features the cute brickheadz eyes , a tiled back and some slopes for his oversized ears . They both feature a stand an the child also has some clear 2&times;2 round&nbsp; bricks for a hovering effect .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is the best brickheadz set ,&nbsp; I have had past and present experience with them I just think this the best one it is the only one I own which seeing how much I love it I wish I got some other retired ones .</p>

"TheMasksYT39","2020-08-04T14:24:33.28Z","Best Brickheadz Ever!","<p>Building Experience: The Building Experience Is Okay. The Child Was Easy But Mando Is A Little Tricky.</p>

<p>The Child: This Brickheadz Is The Cutest And Is Better Than Mando. He Has His Egg He Lays In And When You Take Him Out Of The Egg He Is So Small!</p>

<p>Mando: The Brickheadz For Mando Is Great But Like I Said The Head Is Hard To Build. But The Weirdest Part Is That On His Belt Are 2 Chrome (I Know It&#39;s Not Real Chrome But I&#39;m Not Calling It Fake Chrome) Lightsaber Hilts So Either This Means Lego Forgot To Put Normal Grey Lightsaber Hilts Or Mando Gets Some Lightsabers In Season 2 (But Lego Probably Meant To Put The Normal Grey Hilts There)</p>

<p>In My Opinion If You Love The Mandalorian And Star Wars Buy This Set!&nbsp;</p>

"DoonsterBuildsLego","2021-05-04T17:40:34.167Z","A nice rendition of the central Mandalorian characters that should appeal to fans","<p>I&#39;m not a fan of the look of the Brick Headz but this one certainly looks the part. I was drawn to it as it looks like a nice stylised rendition of the characters from The Mandalorian show, of which I am a fan. The Child model retains all the cuteness from the TV show and The Mandalorian looks suitably imposing for the scale with his characteristic gunslinger stance.</p>

<p>Both characters build around the characteristic Brick Headz square frame, the Child as a 3x3 and Mando as a 4x4. There is also the rendition of the Child&#39;s floating pram. The instructions are in two booklets and pieces come as two numbered groups, part 1 for the Child and part 2 for Mando, which facilitates building and can also support a joint building activity.</p>

<p>I find the pram nicely put together, recreating the characteristic shape from the show and allowing the Child to sit in nicely, standing on a couple of studs to enable easy removal. The pram sits on a couple of transparent round bricks to give the illusion of floating.</p>

<p>Mando is the more interesting build here, with a very unusual but effect technique used for forming the lower part of the helmet face. He is dressed in his old armour, rather than the updated beskar armour that he wears for most of the 2 series, this however could be easily adjusted with a few judicious parts replacements for grey and black. On his belt are a pair of binoculars and 2 metallic silver lightsaber hilts to represent the disintegration rounds for his rifle. He carries a blaster in his hand and the rifle clipped to his back.</p>

<p>Both models incorporate all the key features to really make them readily identifiable.</p>

<p>There is a nice range of sideways (SNOT) building elements here, plus nice accessories for Mando himself. The set certainly had enough parts that I wanted for me to buy a second copy as a parts pack.</p>

<p>I suggest a few parts changes/replacements for a slightly better build IMO:</p>

<p>- For the Child at steps 3 &amp; 4 I would suggest swapping the white &amp; black 2x4 plates: the top plate isn&#39;t visible but just a little of the black pokes through as it is in the instructions. I removed one of the 2 transparent support bricks to give a better illusion of floating, but this does make the model less stable, especially when removing and replacing the Child from the pram.</p>

<p>- For Mando, at steps 28 &amp; 30 there are 2 1x2 plates in each step which are better replaced with 1x4 Dark Stone/Bluish Grey. At steps 31 &amp; 37, the 2x2 and 1x2 plates are better replaced with 2x3 plates, again in Dark Stone/Bluish Grey</p>

<p>I did find, overall, the building to be very satisfying.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve scored this low on playability only because these are really display models, rather than a playset. But they do look really nice when finished, and the Child can be removed from the pram.</p>

<p>At full price this is quite good value, good for a basket filler for Lego.com purchases but can also be had for decent discounts online which can make it very good value (which how I purchased it and why i bought a second copy).</p>
