"mini_mads1980","2020-09-02T11:14:48.87Z","Joey's Lost Her Bike","<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Joey came &quot;free&quot; with Issue 5 of the Hidden Side Comic, which was available in the UK between 05 February 2020 and 03 March 2020.&nbsp; The cover price was &pound;3.99.&nbsp; She is the second haunted Minifigure to appear within this line, and the first biker.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>They have kept the smaller foil packet with the incredibly strong glue keeping it sealed.&nbsp; The image on the front is of the possessed version of the character, holding a red crowbar and it also shows the biker helmet that you get too.&nbsp; What is missing is the second face.&nbsp; The bottom right shows a generic head rather than the one you <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6174813/mini-head-no-2113"">get</a>.&nbsp; They have also kept the 6+ age rating, which is too high in my opinion.</p>

<p>The back of the packet has a ghost on the flap part and the 1:1 image is of the red crowbar.&nbsp; Other than the usual cautions there is nothing else on the back.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Joey, the female biker from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70421-1/El-Fuego-s-Stunt-Truck"">70421</a>, is not unique to this set and appears exactly as she does in El Fuego&#39;s Stunt Truck.&nbsp; The ghost head element you get is also as per that set, however she has a different ghost hair element here.</p>

<p>The printed <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6273386/mini-upper-part-no-4827"">torso</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6273295/mini-lower-part-no-1750"">legs</a> are perfect for a biker and the back of the torso has the bike gang name printed - Hares of Havoc - along with its logo, that is also on the front of the torso as a small medallion/necklace.&nbsp; The helmet does not come with a visor.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>There is nothing to build here other that Joey in her two guises.&nbsp; The printed torso and legs are good and could be used in any Lego city, however the ghostly elements are limited.&nbsp; The only accessory is a red crowbar that is extremely common.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>For &pound;3.99 you can&#39;t complain about getting a comic and a Minifigure with two interchangeable heads / hair pieces.&nbsp; It would have been good if the comic sets could be used with the App, but none have to date and I doubt that will change.</p>

<p>Standalone&nbsp;this set offers little play value.&nbsp; If you have the Stunt Truck then again it will not add anything as it will only duplicate a Minifigure you already have.&nbsp; Maybe a different head could have made just enough difference to warrant getting this, or even the inclusion of an actual bike like has appeared in a couple of the City Comic sets.</p>

<p>The next issue comes with JB and her Ghost-Gun.</p>
