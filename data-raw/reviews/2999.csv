While they may be dry as far as type, I like their acessories and weapons.  Second, this set provides exactly what a starting castle fan will need.  You can pretend that two of the minifigs are opposing the other two.

Altogether, a good set for beginners and everyone.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-03-20T18:54:52.28Z","Army builder ","This is a great set, a help if you are searching for make an army with some 1990's castle minifigures like the fright knights, including too a horse, a witch and some itens, like weapons, a crystal ball, shields, covers, the characteristic bat like helmets from the fright knights, all useful. The minifigures and the all set are from the lines of fright knigts, very cool, and classic. This set is awesome, not exciting, but if you add it to another sets, you turn it greater. This, like all lego, can be mixed easily to the another sets, and i see that to make a review, and is because it that i rate this set 5/5, the rate that it deserves.   ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

(Or like me, for those who were too poor to afford the bigger sets even at Christmas.) They had different names for them, Minifigures Pack, Mini-Figures Collection, or names like Buccaneers and Fright Force.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the Fright Force set. It features two types of Fright Knigths, a Bat Lord without cape, a black horse and the wicked witch. (Complete with ruby wand and crystal ball.)</p>
<p>You don't really build anything aside from the mini-figures in this set. They didn't include special little vehicles or other odds and ends like todays modern Battle Packs. But they were cheap and fun and you could have hours of battles out of one or two sets alone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a way I miss those days, LEGO rarely offers up this type of set anymore and the Troop Builders in the Star Wars theme and such are often hit or miss in my opinion. Dollar Value wise these sets used to cost less than 10$ in fact 5$ and some change could get you them easy if I remember right.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These days the Witch has lost her magic wand and crystal ball, which I really wish I hadn't lost, but if you're still looking for a good troop building set of Fright Knights to add to your Castle Collection I can't recommend this one enough. The only thing I think the set is lacking in is the fact that the Bat Lord doesn't come with his cape, also there aren't any actual bats included with this set.</p>",TRUE,5,4,2,5,5
