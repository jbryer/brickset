It&rsquo;s basically another attempt at a jewelry LEGO theme similar to Clickits. And I feel that this theme will involve more building and work out better than Clickits did. This Polybag introduces me to the theme and I am actually fairly impressed with the model here, but I&rsquo;m not sure I&rsquo;d go in for the entire theme.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Very nice model. Works well as a small picture frame.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Enough tiles included for any design you&rsquo;d care to create for your frame.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Very nice price per piece ratio.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Not for everybody, mostly for folks who enjoy arts and crafts with their LEGO bricks.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">I bought this because it is a Polybag. I like the solid look of the model, but I&rsquo;m not going to be very creative with it. I guarantee it. That being said, for the target demographic interested in this Theme, this is a solid set. Definitely recommend getting it if you enjoy these sorts of themes. The colour choice is also highly desirable and very well implemented. Recommended.</p>
