Some plates can help fix the issue. c) there are some gaps on the front sides, where you can see gray technic beams.

You can easily put all the figures from 75254 AT-ST Raider and 75267 Mandalorian Battle Pack in there and still have some space for a cargo crate. For a toy this is a great playfeature in my eyes and the possibility to reach all that inside space is a clever part of the model. And still it is robust like a toy should be. b) the cockpit and weapon storage. The cockpit offers space for two minifigures and can be pimped with a few console-tiles. The weapon storage can hold up to 4 guns inside. And we get a lot of weapons in this set! c) the overall design. Of course, things can be done better. But this model offers a good deal between &ldquo;toy with maximum inside-space and playfeatures&rdquo; and &ldquo;display-model&rdquo;. Like &ldquo;the Mandalorian&rdquo;, who was a good deal to the whole &ldquo;STAR WARS Thing&rdquo;, this version is a good deal for the whole &ldquo;LEGO STAR WARS Universe&rdquo;. </span></font></font></font></p>

And all who know the series will know it&#39;s a timeline error. Just like the problem with Obi Wan in the new Grievous fighter-set. Besides that, it&#39;s nice to get another Scout Trooper. And I really love the more accurate version of the scout helmet. The IG 11 is a nice figure, but totally the same as the IG 88 from Bounty Hunter Speeder Bike Battle Pack. So no big deal. Last but not least, Greef Karga. He looks quite good, but Lego really should have given him printed legs. He is wearing a cape over his right shoulder that should go deeper than to the waist. So he looks a little odd. But his double sided head looks marvelous and really matches the onscreen character. Anyway, he is one main character from season 1. And now we got him. And he is the only exclusive figure in this set. But unfortunately, there is no Kuill. Maybe we get him and a pair of new moulds for the Blurrg and the new armour in an upcoming set.

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-09-11T06:48:03.697Z","The Waiting is the Hardest Part","<p>Never had I had to wait so long to get a set than this set. No I didn&#39;t preorder it the first day it appeared on the Lego website, I was responsible and waited for May 4th to get the gift with purchase. Well here we are at the start of September and let me say the wait was worth it!</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Minifigures&nbsp;</p>

<p>So you get Mando obviously, but sadly he remains unchanged from the AT-ST set in his original armor. I find this acceptable as it goes along with the bounties frozen in carbon (as does Greef and even IG-11). Am I disappointed he isn&#39;t in beskar? Of course, they&#39;ll have no excuse not to highlight that in subsequent sets. He does have a solid black head, which I guess is also appropriate for this timeframe, I&#39;m sure this too shall change.&nbsp;It is a nice minifigure and if you don&#39;t already have it you will want it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Greef Karga is another nice minifigure and given that he appears throughout more episodes than probably any other supporting character he is well worth getting. Nothing special about him, but it certainly does look like him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>IG-11 I think is an interesting choice without Kuiil, but he too deserves to be showcased. He isn&#39;t really any different from any other IG unit Lego made in the past, but then again, he is no different from any other IG unit in the galaxy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You get a biker scout which to me seems very inappropriate for this set as by the time they appear, Mando has been wearing beskar for quite a while. He also is a standard biker scout. In my opinion he should have a shoulder bag like the Indiana Jones minifigures, it would at least give him something to punch! I also think that his inclusion would have justified a speeder bike as a mini-build, I guess I&#39;ll have to piece one together now. But really a standard storm trooper would have been more appropriate, or better yet the unnamed man who hires Mando to find a 50 year old bounty.</p>

<p>Of course you probably don&#39;t care about any of the above minifigures, because what you want is Baby Yoda! Well you don&#39;t get him until bag 2, and while I was tempted to open bag 2 first, I figured I waited half a year already, what&#39;s one more bag. So after finishing bag 1, I opened bag 2 and to my horror Baby Yoda was missing! For 5 minutes I was going crazy, trying not to scream since the kids were asleep, until I discovered there is a second smaller bag 2! That is where Baby Yoda was hiding. He is my first baby minifigure so I was a little surprised to learn that he is in no way posable and his hands are incapable of holding knobs, but he looks incredible nonetheless. His rubber head is the unique mold here and it was designed brilliantly, capturing all of his cuteness.&nbsp;I particularly like how Mando can carry him, although I must admit I would have loved to get a floating stroller, I guess I&#39;ll build my own, although I&#39;m not sure the right bricks exist to make it look good at the correct scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Parts</p>

<p>This is an expensive set, but it does have a lot of very large parts and not too many smaller parts. The part I was most impressed with, aside from the cockpit coverings, would have to be these I shaped technic bricks which I have never seen before (although I&#39;ve never bought a technic set). I would say it is a very nice selection although very gray. The stickers are actually quite welcome as they do greatly improve the overall look of the set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Build</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised with how the build turned out. The base of the ship is first and uses a little but not too much technic. But ultimately it is the way that the set uses technic that gives it its rigidity and openness. &nbsp;The build is incredibly varied as you build out the top and front of the ship, as well as the engines. The sides are panels, which is very common in many Star Wars vehicles and allow you to completely open it up. The only thing repetitive about the build is the engines as you build two of them and they feature eight flaps each going around the front of them. Overall the build took me 3 hours. While it wasn&#39;t anything revolutionary, it was varied and fun and very well done.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Model&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is truly an amazing model, on par with the Millennium Falcon sets in terms of both size and playability. Clearly a lot of thought went into designing it and it shows. One feature of the interior is Mando&#39;s bed (and Baby Yoda&#39;s hiding place) which is nice to have. There is no door to the room, but had one been included it would make it very hard to use and access. It is decorated with 2 stickers along its panel wall which look good, but I feel that Lego missed an opportunity by not including stickers on the opposite side of these panels that could have represented the carbon freezing chamber and weapon locker. Yes, that&#39;s right, I actually wanted more stickers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You also get two bounties in carbon freezing that neatly slide into holders so that they do not shift during flight. These are simple tall bricks with stickers on them and are clearly inferior to the well designed Han in carbon, but they also are much smaller and therefore give you a lot more interior space to play with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The other really tight space towards the front of the ship can be used to store the three missiles that come with the set, meaning if all three are here, the two spring loaded shooters are empty, but I do like this feature for both storage and not accidentally losing missiles that are loaded.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond that the rest of the interior is open, and both sides and the back fold down to give you easy access to all of it. Now access isn&#39;t all that easy as it is difficult to squeeze you fingers with minifigures into the space, but it is doable, and you can hold quite a few minifigures inside, although IG-11 has to bend over.&nbsp;</p>

<p>on top you get a cockpit with two red seats and a printed 1x2 tile for the controls. While I love the cool window brick that encloses the set, the interior of the cockpit is probably the only disappointment here. The red seats just seem to be out of place in such a bright color, although I do appreciate how Mando&#39;s cape fits over them. I also would have liked to see an old Classic Space movable antenna brick as a control to represent the knob that becomes Baby Yoda&#39;s toy. It would be difficult to put one in without replacing the 1x2 tile, but I may need to do that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Behind the cockpit is storage for Mando&#39;s blaster,&nbsp;as well as a second weapon, perhaps a dark saber? Then behind that is a very small but effective escape pod. On either side are well disguised launchers for the spring loaded shooters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides that the engines look fantastic as does the way the front of the ship is built. Underneath you have three skis for the ship to land on although they are off centered due to there being an even number of studs underneath. I feel like this little detail should have been rectified. You also have an unfinished row of bricks underneath the wings that hold up the engines. Now this is only visible from below as the wings and engines hide it, but this too is something that could have easily been covered up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>I think this is a wonderful set, and the fun and engaging build, the accuracy and playability of the model, and the wonderful minifigure collection make it a must have for any Mandalorian fan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now given that the Ghost from Rebels was only produced once and now is prohibitively expensive to get on the second hand market, I would say that if you are enjoying the Mandalorian (and who isn&#39;t) and think that you would like to own a Razor Crest, I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to get this set. You will certainly be glad that you picked it up. Of course you will want to at least add Cara Dune from the AT-ST set as who knows if she will ever be available again, I imagine that Ahsoka&nbsp;will be the next must have minifigure for this series and no doubt Lego knows that.&nbsp;And of course we can only hope that Lego releases a microfighter of Kuiil on a blurrg that can fit inside the ship, and if it&#39;s too few parts they can include a floating stroller!<br />

As a fan of the Mandalorian series, I think this set complements the Razor Crest very well. Only suggestion would&#39;ve been to replace the biker scout with Kuiil minifigure. The missile storage bay on the left front side of the Razor Crest is a nice touch. I would highly recommend this set as a nice addition for collectors, Star Wars and Lego alike.</p>

"lukaszsw","2020-11-06T15:05:27.707Z","one of the best set to play with","<p>It doesn&#39;t look like it but the set is very big and has a lot space for figures inside. Actually the included figures fill up only half of the interior or less!</p>

<p>It has a lot of compartments to put figures and accessories in:</p>

<ul>
	<li>main cockpit</li>
	<li>weapon compartment behind the cockpit</li>
	<li>sleeping compartment and arrows compartment below the cockpit</li>
	<li>entire back section opening (though you can open just back hatch, or just side doors</li>
	<li>carbonite holding area with two blocks (with stickers)</li>
	<li>escape pod with space for one figure.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;The weak points are - front part below cockpit and front engine parts tent to fall off easily. The main interior is a little low for IG-11 figure and it is hard to put him in. The set could be a little cheaper. I&#39;ve got with a discount but at 114 euro it was still quite expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"DBrick","2020-09-14T19:01:13.697Z","Best 2020 set IMO","<p>I&#39;ve been waiting for this set since they announce it. I preordered it and as soon it arrives I built it.</p>

<p>AMAZING is the word that better describes what is this Razor Crest. First&nbsp;because of its own aspect. Ship is incredible and it&#39;s so accurate. Second, because of the build itself. It&#39;s been amazing to build the razor crest, despite the fact that there is some annoying 7x pieces in the last bag.</p>

<p>Minifigs are incredible too. The mandalorian, despite its non-beskar armor, the child, Greef Karga... and even the scout tropper (I do love scout troopers).</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is a 5/5 set.</p>

<p>The BAD things about this set are, from my point of view, two: (1) the stickers and (2) the price. I think this set is a little bit overpriced and I hate stickers. They make more accurate the ship, but its annoying to put 12 stickers on.</p>

<p>Last, but not least, the playability is amazing. My daughter enjoys this ship as one of her favorites.</p>

"CaptainKindling","2020-10-12T21:55:23.64Z","This is the way.","<p>At the time of writing, fans around the world are eagerly awaiting season 2 of The Mandalorian, and the continuation of Mando and The Child&#39;s story together.&nbsp; While season 2 will undoubtedly bring with it all new Lego tie-ins, to date there have only been two Mandalorian Lego sets: the AT-ST Raider, and the Razor Crest.</p>

<p>The personal ship of the titular character, the Razor Crest has become a fan favourite, possibly even standing to become a new Millennium Falcon to the latest generation of fans.&nbsp; As such it has justifiably been brought to life as a large-scale set, coming it at just over 1000 pieces for &pound;120.&nbsp; As far as price-per piece goes, this is leaning slightly more towards to the expensive side of average, but there is so much about this set which makes it worth every penny.</p>

<p>The build is split into 6 sets of numbered bags, accumulating in a 3-4 hour build.&nbsp; There are some very cool pieces included in this set to bring the shape of the Crest together, most notably around the bulky twin engines.&nbsp; There is also a brand new canopy custom made for this set, perfectly recreating the cockpit shape in a way that would have been extremely difficult to achieve otherwise.&nbsp; There are a few stickers in this set, as you&#39;d expect on a build of this size, but thankfully the canopy isn&#39;t one of them, so there&#39;s no risk of leaving conspicuous sticky marks on this beautiful new piece when attempting to get that perfect sticker alignment.&nbsp; Obviously stickers are a divisive point amongst the fans, but do give some added detail to the hull which again would have been tough to achieve just through bricks.</p>

<p>The initial part of the build comprises largely of Technic pieces, forming the bare bones of the Razor Crest on which the hull can take shape.&nbsp; Once this is done, the rest of the build is mostly made up of more traditional pieces.&nbsp; There is a little repetition to the build, most of which comes from the engines, as you may expect.&nbsp; But as these are the final part of the build, you&#39;ll most likely be feeling anxious to finish by this point and there isn&#39;t really any tedium to the process.</p>

<p>Out of the 50ish Star Wars Lego sets in my collection at present, this is only the second one I&#39;ve built with an error in the instructions.&nbsp; Interestingly enough, the other was the AT-ST Raider, leaving me really hoping Lego will up their game a little for the season 2 sets!&nbsp; As with the AT-ST, this isn&#39;t a build-breaking error, but is just an error in the &quot;list of bricks needed for this next stage&quot; box on one instruction.&nbsp; It&#39;s easy enough to spot and correct, so shouldn&#39;t cause any issues for most builders.&nbsp; My other issue with the instructions is one quite common to larger sets, where some stages will only feature the addition of one or two smaller pieces, but the instructions aren&#39;t clear as to where they&#39;re being added to, leading to a game of spot-the-difference with the previous frame to work out what you should be doing next.</p>

<p>Small instruction nitpicks aside, once you&#39;ve built the Razor Crest it&#39;s a sight to behold, and you absolutely feel like you&#39;ve got your monies&#39; worth.&nbsp; It&#39;s packed full of play features, with an accessible cockpit with space for 2 minifigures, a detachable escape pod, again with room for a minifigure.&nbsp; There are a pair of spring-loaded shooters, both of which are fully integrated and fired using buttons set into the top of the ship.&nbsp; The front side panels fold down to access the Madalorian&#39;s sleeping quarters on one side, and a small storage area for weapons and spare missiles on the other.&nbsp; The rear boarding ramp lowers, and the rear side panels can fold down, all of which provide access to the cargo hold, which includes 2 of Mando&#39;s bounties frozen in carbonite.&nbsp; Unlike the Han in carbonite slab which comes with several Slave-I and Cloud City sets, these aren&#39;t moulded pieces, but are just flat slabs with stickers.&nbsp; While moulded pieces would have been a nice touch, the flatter ones don&#39;t really feel like they&#39;re detracting much from the set, and it makes them easier to slot into the provided spaces in the hold.</p>

<p>The minifigure selection for this set is also top-notch.&nbsp; Obviously you get the Mandalorian himself, but as with the AT-ST Raider, he comes with his episode 1 &amp; 2 armour, so no beskar for us.&nbsp; He also comes with a plain black head, so anyone hoping to see a little Lego Pedro Pascal will be disappointed.&nbsp; Aside from that, he&#39;s well detailed and a nice figure in general.&nbsp; You get Greef Karga, who at present is still exclusive to this set.&nbsp; He does have a nice torso print and and a reversable head with two expressions, but the figure is let down a little by having plain red legs, with no printing at all.&nbsp; Then there&#39;s IG-11, mostly consisting of grey battle droid parts, but a decent figure nonetheless.&nbsp; The Scout Trooper is a great minifigure, with nice torso and leg printing, and a fantastic helmet mould.&nbsp; Growing up on Return of the Jedi, the Scouts are my personal favourite Imperial troopers, and this one really does them justice.</p>

<p>And of course the most eagerly awaited minifigure: The Child, or &quot;Baby Yoda&quot;.&nbsp; The box art doesn&#39;t do justice to how small he is, and he&#39;s just the right size to clip onto one of Mando&#39;s hands to allow him to be carried around.&nbsp; The head is nicely detailed and slightly rubbery, giving a bit of flex on those adorable ears.&nbsp; Due to his small size, the rest of his body is cast as a single fixed piece, so the only posability on the little guy is in turning his head left and right.</p>

<p>Overall, there is very little bad I can say about this set, and am happy to rate it 5 stars in every category.&nbsp; As mentioned, there&#39;s a slight error in the instructions, but nothing to justify marking down what could well be the best Star Wars Lego set of 2020.</p>

"zanfar","2020-11-24T01:58:51.91Z","Solid Star Wars Offering","<p>Let&#39;s be honest, you&#39;re buying this for The Child nanofigure. I will admit, the figure is quite cute and a nice addition to my collection. The Mandolorian figure is also well done with lots of detail. The rest don&#39;t really tickle my fancy, but there are a lot of nice details and improvements over previous models if that&#39;s your jam.</p>

<p>The box is great; I like that kits seem to be moving to a thinner box with more front/back real estate. The contents are exactly what you expect: a series of numbered bags with a few loose parts and an instruction book. A first for me, the instruction book was also bagged, which is nice protection against bent corners.</p>

<p>The build is well-thought-out if a bit slow. There are several cases of sequential steps adding only one brick which has always annoyed me, as well as a few points where I thought the steps ought to have been reversed. There is also a typo on step 109 where the legend calls for a single brick, while the visual instructions (and later steps) clearly show two bricks being placed. The same caveats for any ship or star-wars build apply: lots of left-right, symmetrical duplication, and lots of the same color.&nbsp; The double-symmetry of the radial, side-by-side engine nacelles were particularly tiresome--but that&#39;s the cross us space collectors bear. Otherwise, the build is relatively enjoyable, with lots of angles and hinges without being overly complicated.</p>

<p>The final model is a solid 80% for me. It&#39;s swoopable, but the nacelles are a bit fragile for aggressive play. The spring-loaded blaster things (the LEGO weapons that fire a bolt, not a stud) are better integrated than any model I&#39;ve seen before; I don&#39;t use them, but I&#39;m not mad they exist on my model. The firing mechanism is quite ingenious as well--which was quite a nice surprise since they are built rather early in the process and seem like a very flimsy feature before you understand the purpose. The iconic bunk and child play area is modeled, as well as carbonite storage. The rest of the interior is bland but functional.</p>

<p>My only real issue with this model is that I&#39;m not sure who it&#39;s made for. The features and size imply a play kit, but the price is a little above what I would expect a pre-teen to have the budget or gift credit for--but I might just be out-of-touch. Also, the blasters make me think of dogfights, but I&#39;m not aware of any other vehicle kits in this universe. Perhaps we&#39;ll see a folding tie fighter with Moff Gideon or a small set of speeders with other memorable characters in the future. The price point and TV show audience make me think this should be targeted at AFOLs--something the price-per-piece supports as well, being in the range of UCS models. However, the ship is just a little small to truly satisfy at that level. It&#39;s below minifigure-scale, so while the ship&#39;s interior is fairly well used, it&#39;s mostly an open or static area. I would have liked to see a bit larger ship that allowed for a better-working cockpit or functional landing gear. I would easily trade the escape pod for a speeder or a transport pod for The Child.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In all, I&#39;m not dissatisfied with the purchase, but I would advise others to wait for a sale or other promotion. It&#39;s a great model for those that must have some Mandolorian models, but there are better, more playable Star Wars sets out there.</p>

<p>The minifigures are good first starting with Din Djarin himself the Mandalorian he is reused from the 2019 AT-ST raider which wasn&#39;t accurate to that episode that the set was based off and isn&#39;t accurate to the one that you can infer this set is from , he has a gun metal grey Mandalorian helmet (too dark of a colour for his helmet but thanks 75299) , an unprinted black head , a dark grey thin cape , a torso with his chapter 1 a bit of 2 and 3 armour in excellent detail , his legs continue that armour to great effect , he wields his pulse rifle using a small blaster pistol attached to a dark brown lightsaber hilt with a black clip on the end , next we have the man Baby Yoda/The Child/Grogu whatever you want to call him he has a printed sand green head mould in rubber and a printed dark tan baby torso with not much but enough printing , next we have Greef Carga he has Finns hair in black , a smirking face and a grumpy one , his torso is very nicely detailed unlike his legs which are for some reason left blank , he wields two standard small blaster pistols , next we have IG-11 he has a printed 1&times;1 dark grey cylinder attached to a cone and clip , then attached to a dark grey battle droid body with a clip at the back , one vertical and one straight arm and some stationary dark grey battle droid legs , he wields a standard blaster and a long rifle , next we have a scout trooper he has the amazing dual moulded helmet which was introduced in 2019 , a lex Luther head and some continuous armour printing from torso to legs , he wields a standard black small blaster pistol and finally they are not really Minifigures but there are two carbonite Minifigures included they are stickers on 1&times;2&times;5 dark grey bricks one appears to be a mithral and the other a stubble bearing individual they are both tiled off at the top .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build is a very interesting shape so I really don&#39;t know where to begin but here goes , the sides are attached with clips and use a big light grey panel on each side , with grilles at the top in dark grey and different shaped slopes at the base to show the area where the landing head retracts to in the show , toward the end of this panel there are a number of hinges behind to securely connect an angled 8&times;8 light grey plate which lines up great with the top level and makes a great Segway into me talking about the rear boarding ramp which is between both large panels , it is built on a dark grey 6&times;8 plate with angled plates ontop to create the necessary curve for the exterior panels to be flush together , there is a hinge connection at the base with two light grey 2&times;3 tiles securing them in place whilst two dark grey 1&times;2 grilles make for more detail , before the main side panels you have the side boarding ramps which are built on 4&times;6 dark grey modified plates with bars at the base and a 4&times;4 light grey tile with four studs used for a sticker showcasing some of the ships signature yellow stripes but the stickers for the stripes are in dark tan which I think works just as well , and the panels underneath the cockpit are attached with more secure hinges attaching them , these feature a thicker build with sloping right at the bottom and&nbsp;at the front , these also feature the main cannons of the craft with an elongated black technic pin for the tip of the barrel and a build around a long yellow technic axle there are two 2&times;2 light grey round bricks then some 1&times;2 dark grey technic bricks with jumpers and 1&times;1 dark grey round tile attached around some over hanging slopes for greebleing , at the rear there is a 2&times;2 round tile , a 2&times;2 light grey round brick and a dark grey astromech droid body with a half technic pin attached with another 1&times;1 dark grey round tile , underneath that&nbsp;there is a 3&times;10 light grey slope with more stripe sticker detail and above that a 2&times;3 light grey tile with strip sticker detail that lines up with the 3&times;10 , just above that , not attached to the retractable panel there are two 1&times;10 light grey slopes offset from one another that provide extra sloping towards&nbsp;the cockpit windshield&nbsp;, this is mirrored in both sides , at the very front nose of the ship there is a 4&times;8 black plate with a dark grey 2&times;4 tile and two 1&times;1 corner tiles in dark grey , around this there is a duplicated slope build made out of seven 1&times;3 half arches making the iconic rounded nose of the ship this is topped of with two 1&times;8 dark grey tiles so it is consistently smooth other than two light grey 1&times;1 hollow studs for what I think are the flood&nbsp;lights next to each other at the bottom of the front&nbsp; and finally there are three stations for landing gear all using the technic attached dark grey ski piece , there is&nbsp;one in the centre of the front&nbsp;and two embedded in with inverted slopes underneath the slope shapes on the main panels where the landing gear retracts&nbsp;in universe . Now the interior of the main cargo hold and the spots behind the cannon panels towards the front , when you pull down the main panels , the rear boarding ramp and the side boarding ramps you get access to a vacant but in a good way main cargo hold , on each side there are two essential and I mean ESSENTIAL technic lift arms on each side in light grey , just to note the main ship is built on a 2&times;6 light grey plate a pair of 6&times;8 dark grey plates and two 6&times;6 dark grey plates , the flooring is tiled and plates in light and dark grey , at the back near where the ramp closes there are two dark grey 1&times;3 plates and there is an assembly on some dark grey jumpers with a light grey 1&times;2 snot brick in the middle with a 1&times;2 dark tan tile on each side with a dark tan 1&times;2 cheese slope to wedge in the carbonite frozen individuals&nbsp;as this is where they go and when they are in they are pretty secure and that&#39;s it for this part of the interior . Now we move to the left side of the Razor Crest where if we pull down the panel which has the side cannon connected to , we reveal a sleeping quarters for mando and Grogu in the back there are two 1&times;4 light tan wall panels with stickers on each of them , the floor is fairly uneven as expected as this is just empty space Lego cleverly made use of , the bed has&nbsp;two light grey 1&times;2 jumpers then a 2&times;3 light grey tile with a 1&times;2 light tan cheese slope for the pillow , in the right hand side when you lower the panel that has the cannon you reveal , an almost empty room with just three 1&times;1 modified black bricks stacked ontop of one another with a vertical clip , Lego intend this to be the place for you to store you spare spring load but I use it as mandos signature weapons cupboard where I place his pulse rifle and the spring load when he is inside the cockpit and the floor in here is also as uneven as the sleeping quarters .&nbsp; Now moving onto the top of the craft starting at the back and moving our&nbsp;way towards the cockpit , the back area has a fairly decent overhang from where the cargo hold ends there are two&nbsp;modified 1&times;2 snot plates with a 1&times;4 dark grey plate with a 1&times;2 light grey grille attached in the middle and a light grey stud next to it on both sides , three 4&times;6 plates with studs around 3/4 sides are used to get a textured feel across the spine type area of the ship , one of the 4&times;6 is elevated compared to the others around here ,&nbsp;there are long thin light grey angle plates underneath these , they are 1&times;6 underslope dark grey bricks and a various amount of snot pieces used to attach 2&times;4 dark grey slope bricks and a 2&times;3 light grey slope brick with a 1&times;2 light grey grille to make the angle perfect for where the back panels all line up , then there is a spot for the heat vents where there is a hinge connection on each side of a 1&times;2 black rounded plate attached to jumpers , just before the hinges there are two 1&times;2 black grilles and there are two on each hinge anyway , straight in the middle there is an escape pod that will be covered later and it is surrounded by round bricks at corners , bricks and brick slopes at the areas&nbsp;facing forward , with dark grey tiles ontop with the corners using 1&times;2&times;1 rounded tiles . The body then breaks off into a strut on each side ,with more dark&nbsp;tan stripes now with plates not stickers with 2&times;2 light grey triangle tiles around with some slopes going down&nbsp;to a spring loaded shooter placement where to shoot it you push&nbsp;down on a clip with a grille tile ontop , then some angled dark grey plates at the front to get the slope back , a newer slope piece(&nbsp;introduced in the 20th anniversary slave I ) to get the correct upwards facing angle and these surround the spring loaded shooters and two light grey CMF stands are used on each side to cover up the vibrant colours beneath . Before we do the cockpit we are going to do the thrusters the back end has an inverted 2&times;2 tile in trans orange in the base of a gun metal grey barrel used for the outlets of the thrusters , these are attached to a 6&times;6 light grey rounded plate , with a large light grey round panel on the outward side of each panel with a large and detailed sticker to further the shape , there is a big technic wheel in dark grey each with the intakes consisting of seven similar builds attached&nbsp;to a modified 2&times;2 with bars , there is a 2&times;2 light grey dome brick in the centre , the inner side has a similar build to the nose at the very front using&nbsp;the same light grey arch piece with a 2&times;4 dark grey slope brick used to make the builds more flushed with the wings that they are connected to . Around the cockpit there is further sloping down with more 3&times;10 long slopes with more sticker detailing for the stripes on each side ,and the back of the cockpit uses a large windshield piece in light grey attached to a clip assembly so it can hinge back to reveal two clips to store some weaponry or tools , the windshield is a new piece for the set and has great print with a modified 1&times;2 light grey plate with a bar as a handle to remove it and access the inside , the interior has a 1&times;2 dark grey printed console cheese slope , tiles around the sides and there are two red chairs for mando and another figure . And finally the escape pod is very reminiscent of the one that Rey uses from the falcon in the last Jedi , it has a circular window with a roof with tiles and layered plates the sides have 1&times;2 light grey cheese slopes and the thrusters use dark grey 1&times;1 cones and it is attached to the outside&nbsp;with&nbsp;a single 2&times;2 red&nbsp;jumper on a beam that runs through the centre of the Razor Crest for structural support .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is the longest review I have written to date&nbsp;but it&nbsp;is&nbsp;of a set that I adore the build is fantastic and packed with room for the figures and looks fantastic on display , my only issues are with the figures where mando is not in his beskar armour and where&#39;s kuil he should have been here also the scout trooper should really have a speeder bike but luckily if you have or are getting 75288 AT-AT that comes with a speeder that can be used for this scout also Greef looks fairly incomplete without leg printing&nbsp; so overall I recommend it to any Lego star wars fan as it is just fantastic .</p>

"KnightOfRen","2020-12-29T18:34:22.103Z","A great building experience, and beautiful final product","<p><b>75292 LEGO Razor Crest REVIEW</b></p>

<p>As the release of The Mandalorian has caused lots of hype, lego is releasing a&nbsp;<em>small&nbsp;</em>wave of sets for the series. The largest and by far most eye catching is the 75292 Razor Crest.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience:&nbsp;</strong>This was a fun build, it took me roughly 2 hours. There is some very interesting techniques used. Its easy (But still fun!) to put together, and it has a nice selection and use of parts as well. All I can say negatively is how repetitive putting the &ldquo;fins&rdquo; on the front of the engines&nbsp;<strong>14 times.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p><strong>Minifigs:&nbsp;</strong>The Mandalorian minfig: This figure shows a great level of detail all throughout. The beskar helmet is gorgeous in the Gunmetal grey color. Mando comes with a pulse rifle, but the drawback is the fact that it does&nbsp;<em>not have a stock. oof size: Large.&nbsp;</em>He also does not carry a blaster pistol. But the detail, IMO, makes up for it. Greef Karga: In my opinion, this figure looks a bit too simple. But the torso piece is nice, I just feel a leg print would have been nice. The weapons seem about right, and the face is good. Overall a good fig, just could be better detailed. IG-11: This bounty droid slightly varies from previous IG-88 Minifigs, and it looks very nice. Compared to the show, it is accurate. The only downside is how&nbsp;<strong>hard it is to get the thing to stand upright&nbsp;</strong><em>sighs deeply.&nbsp;</em>Scout Trooper: This figure has not been changed much, as far as I know. But he looks excellent, and LEGO FANS HAVE VICTORY!! ANGRY CLONE HAS BEEN ELIMINATED AFTER YEARS!! This is a fantastic figure, and I hope to see more of him. The Child: To many, this is the star of the set. The child&#39;s adorable onscreen appearance has brought much hype when a LEGO version was announced. The figure&#39;s head is very nice, but going down, the body and legs are &ldquo;meh&rdquo;. It doesn&#39;t look like the thick, long robe that he had in the show. Looking past that, it is still a good fig, I just wish they had designed a new bottom piece.</p>

<p><strong>Design:&nbsp;</strong>This build makes clever use of many cool parts, including a brand-new canopy piece. This piece is printed as well. The build has many opening panels, but the annoying ones are the large side panels. 1) These panels did not open in the show 2) They often open when you do not want them to. I love the cockpit, its simple, but accommodates all the necessary characters for playing out scenes from Season 1 and 2. The main interior is empty, but it leaves room for an enormous amount of cargo (I added speeders, a ladder, fuel, and some crates already). The sleeping quarters look excellent, and leave room for Mando and Grogu to sleep. It also holds weapons behind the cockpit. The spring-loaded shooters are well integrated and do not stick out, which is great.A pretty good design overall.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Is the set worth $130? The set is filled with mass, and it has good play value and features. In size/stature, it definitely feels like $130 worth of stuff. Even forgetting things like Price to Part ratio (Which is good enough in itself), this still has good value! Imo, it is worth the price of $130.</p>

<p><strong>Overall:&nbsp;</strong>This is a fun set with good features, and a nice build experience. I would highly recommend this to anyone into the Mandalorian and LEGO who likes cool build techniques.</p>

"npapag","2022-05-10T16:59:06.103Z","For collectors and more, a unique set.","<p>For any traditional collector, and while waiting for its UCS version, the Razor Crest essentially adds to its collection. Very &#39;solid&#39; construction, many Technics pieces, with many and fun game possibilities. It is true to the original design. The choice of minifigures is enjoyable: Mando, Scout Trooper, Greef Karga, IG-11 and Baby Yoda (AKA Grogu). Of course,&nbsp;it came at a premium price (EUR150) but it is worth it for anyone who has enjoyed The Mandalorian.</p>

"RundownPear","2022-03-22T15:55:33.533Z","The New Icon","<p>This is a very solid build with decent features for a good price.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The figures are fine. Greef, Mano, IG-11, Grogu, and the amazing scout trooper are all great additions but Quill really should have been included.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set&nbsp;was one of the most fun builds I have done in a long time, it is just really satisfying to see it come together. It is really solid and has featured just about everywhere it can. The carbonate stickers are awesome and a nice homage to classic LSW. The escape pod is accurate to the source material and a very nice detail, the cockpit could have been more detailed but the printed windshield is great. The front part of the ship has the bunk and storage area, both of which are great inclusions; although the toilet would have been nice to see. The rear ramp and cargo area are large and sufficient enough to store many of Lego&#39;s speeder builds which is nice to see. The front of the exterior looks amazing but gradually gets worse as we move backward. Another 100 pieces could have added some more details to the rear but I am still happy with what we have now.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall his is a solid set for any fan of modern Star Wars. I hope we get more feature-filled hero ships like this in the future from Lego and look forward to future iterations of this icon.&nbsp;</p>

"Tristan_The_Lego_Lover","2023-02-05T13:32:30.517Z","GREAT STAR WARS SET!","<p>The Razor Crest (75292) is a great Star Wars Lego set. The outside consists of 2 lazer guns on the&nbsp;front, spring-loaded&nbsp;missiles on both sides between the engines which you push down on vents to fire. There is also an&nbsp;escape pod on the top of the ship. There are fold&nbsp;down hatches on the front sides the one on the left is a bedroom and the one on the right is a spring-loaded missile storage.</p>

<p>The cab consists of 2 seats and a printed computer. Behind the cab is a pull-up weapon storage for 2 weapons. The back of the ship consists of one ramp on the back two big fold downs on the side, and also two small ramps in front of that. Which means basically the whole back folds for room to play. Inside the back there is a carbonite&nbsp;rack with two carbonites and the fugitives&nbsp;printed on the carbonite&nbsp;the mando captures in season one of the mandolorian. Overall i think this set is great and would definitely recommend buying whether you&#39;re getting it for play or for display, it is great for both.</p>
