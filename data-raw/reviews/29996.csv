<p>On the Stewart one the eyepiece is very loose wish they could have used the same technique that used on Bob and Kevin</p>

<p>Other than that A+++++++</p>

Nothing fresh.&nbsp;Playability: acceptable for adults, not enough for kids. (Note that this set is more likely to be for kids.)&nbsp;There are some printed pcs, but stickers too. The &quot;name tag&quot; stickers for each lair sucks cuz it is hard to center the sticker on a long piece.</p>

<p>The building experience is a disaster. It&#39;s very fragile in the middle, so that it broke apart many times when I tried to add force to make pieces tight together. It means you have to be very careful to control your force when building. It&#39;s acceptable for adults, but kids won&#39;t like it. I&#39;m 18, still annoyed by it. However when everything&#39;s done, the structure is very tight and stable, which is nice.</p>

<p>The other thing is that, though I think 50 bucks for 876 pcs is pretty neat, lego is trying to cheat for more money cuz you cannot build 3 of them in one set. You can either choose to build Kevin or Bob. You have to buy 2 same sets&nbsp;for all 3 minions lairs. Perhaps buying bag No.2 only on eBay is a better option.</p>

<p>Despite all the drawbacks I said above, I am&nbsp;still disappointed by the instruction design. The set is definitely not only for kids (though mainly for kids) but also adults as the age &quot;8+&quot; and its neat and cute outlook. However the instruction is just the building steps without any introduction at the front pages, like other &quot;adult-set&quot; instructions. Why didn&#39;t lego add some&nbsp;description of the movie or the designers&#39; thoughts to make it more like a &quot;worth-for-collection&quot; set?</p>

"sideswinger","2022-10-29T15:12:24.547Z","the PERFECT set!","<p>Growing up, I was always a huge fan of the Despicable Me franchise. Me and my siblings, who were homeschooled, watched the original 2010 film more times than I can count. The second film, which released in 2013, was a huge hit in my house, and I&#39;ve always enjoyed it more than the others of the franchise. Minions released in 2015, and I remember watching it at home after my cousin&#39;s 3rd birthday party, and I liked it enough, just not nearly as much as the others. The 3rd film, which released in 2017, came at a busy point in my life, but I still found a lot of enjoyment in it, and I still occasionally rematch the franchise to this day! Now Minions: Rise of Gru was a complete and utter monstrosity, but you, my reader, are probably wondering, &quot;what the heck is he doing, reviewing movies? Has he lost his mind?&quot; To that, I reply with yes, I have lost my mind, but I&#39;m adding context to how much the Despicable Me franchise means to me. So obviously, I was absolutely enthralled when LEGO sets were announced for it. One of the sets I requested for Christmas 2020 was 75551 Brick-built Minions and their Lair. It released in April of 2020, and was surprisingly retired in December, only seven months later. This set is attractive for its large piece count of 876, coupled with a fantastic price tag of only $49.99, which is already great value. But what of the set itself?</p>

<p>Inside the box are five bags, two of which are labelled as bag 1, and three of which are labelled bag 2. Bag 1 solely contains parts for Stuart, while bag 2 contains pieces for Tim and Bob. Two loose instruction manuals are included, and much like the bags, instruction booklet 1 is for Stuart, while 2 is for Tim and Bob. The stickers for this set are also loose in the box; that&#39;s a little unfortunate, since it makes it liable to bend in the box, but it would take more plastic to package all the leaflets together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>The building process is certainly enjoyable the first time around, as it&#39;s very interesting to watch the minion come together. If you disassemble Kevin and turn him into Bob, the build can become tedious, but it definitely is an overall fun experience.</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>The minifigure here are good, but I have some complaints with them. You see, all 3 main minions, Kevin, Bob, and Stuart, are included, but Bob and Stuart are not included in their standard outfit. Instead, Bob is in a martial-arts suit, and Stuart is in Pajamas. Stuart&#39;s variation is exclusive, but I just wish they would be in their normal blue overalls versus these designs. Nonetheless, I love the structure of these characters, which consist of a base, arms, head, eyes, and hair.</p>

<p>Nothing on Bob is exclusive, but he&#39;s still a good figure. His bottom piece is dual-moulded, with a yellow top connection and a yellow-orange outfit. His arms connect using technic pins which make them poseable, and there are black stripes printed onto the sides. He wears a tan hat.</p>

<p>Stuart is the only character here with an exclusive torso and head. The torso is tri-moulded, with yellow at the studs, light blue for the shirt, and white for his shoes. The white stripes are printed all the way around the base, and light blue arms connect via technic pins. Stuart&#39;s head is also exclusive, thanks to his small smirk, which was a new expression for the character. The black goggles are moulded onto the yellow base. A 1x1 tile snaps onto the front, and He includes a banana as an accessory.</p>

<p>Lastly, Kevin is included here, and I think he&#39;s my favourite, thanks to his elongated head. His torso is that standard blue overall design that I personally like more than the alternate outfits found in this set. Like Stuart, his body is tri-moulded with yellow, blue, and black, and there&#39;s some nice printing on front. His head has an expression that did not stay exclusive, but I love the small hair piece that I believe was made for this character. His hair is interchangeable with a white construction hat.</p>

<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Now two minions can be built at the same time, either Stuart and Kevin, or Stuart and Bob. Bob and Kevin use the same pieces, so they cannot be displayed simultaneously.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll start with Stuart, and I love the setup of these builds. They capture Illumination&#39;s iconic minions absolutely perfectly, with their small, stubby legs, short arms, and portly figure. The way the overalls are built using layered plates is genius, in how they&#39;re present all the way around. I also commend the accurate 3-fingered hands. His face at the front is thankfully printed onto a panel, and I do wish his expression was a little happier, but that face can easily be exchanged for Bob&#39;s, so no issue there. I love how&nbsp;accurately huge his eye is, and it uses a large dish inside a technic element. The length of his head is fittingly much smaller than Kevin&#39;s, making them easily differentiable, aside from the eyes. Stuart has hair atop his head, which is cleverly made from black fangs. The goggles are made from black bricks, but at the back, the whole build can be opened to reveal a lair. Inside doesn&#39;t exactly look the best, but it does enhance the playability. There&#39;s seven stickered parts inside, which is a little excessive, but I&#39;m no stickler for stickers. If you rotate the 2x2 brick atop the back, you can spin his big eye at the front.</p>

<p>I personally like Kevin a little bit more than Stuart. From the outside, the build is almost identical up to the head, besides his longer yellow arms which accurately extend past his body and caress the ground. Past the body, his head is accurately much longer than Stuart&#39;s. A smiley expression matches the minifigure, and the expressions on all 3 brick-built minions are interchangeable since their parts share dimensions. He sports two smaller eyes, which use exclusive pieces. The plant-base in black works wonderfully for his hair. The interior is fairly fleshed out, and you can fit Kevin inside, even when it&#39;s closed.&nbsp;Eleven stickers are inside, which is definitely way too many, and applying them can become tiresome. Various nick-nacks are clipped onto the sides.</p>

<p>Bob&#39;s exterior for some reason looks slightly off, but his interior is easily my favourite of all 3 minion builds. It&#39;s all dojo-fighting themed, and it has a bust in the middle as well as some foliage at the sides.</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>

<p>Overall, I adore this set, and it&#39;s probably in my top 10 favourite LEGO sets ever. It&#39;s such a great concept that&#39;s executed absolutely perfectly. But the main way this shines is at the price. 876 pieces for only $49.99 is insane value that really shocks me. Most of these Minions sets have good value, but the pricing here is the best of the theme. 5 out of 5, and if I were ranking it from 1-10, it&#39;d be a 9.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! I hope it was helpful!</p>
