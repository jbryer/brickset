I recently purchased this re-release, and I have to say this set hasn't aged one little bit, is quite possibly the finest castle set Lego have ever turned out.  The building is a cottage-like structure sandwiched to a stretch of castle wall.  Detail is unfaultable, with chimney, table and chairs complete with goblets, a stable for horses, Tudor-beam walls, little arched windows with shutters and a minifigs including soldiers and serving wench.  It's a shame the new box doesn't display the alternative building ideas on the original box, but that doesn't detract from a fine set.

"A_Brickset_user","2003-08-02T00:00:00Z","","I just got it, attached it to Black Falcon's Fortress (I removed the Crusader Knights, made them a two man wondering knights troupe, and turned the Falcon Knight into an archer.), had some fun (+ some trouble with some incredibly weak spiral staircases of my own making), and it looks great. I hope to get a second, so I can build it up to make a good sized inn. The innkeeper is more like nobility than an innkeeper, so I removed the headwear cone, and the cape, and gave her a ponytail hairpiece. The headwear bit came in handy finishing off the queen of my Castleworld. I seriously recommend this set to all LEGO fans, it's great! Why was my box all black and white, with clouds on the back instead of alternate building ideas??????? The second set this year that actually offered me a challenge to build. The first was my Black Falcon's Fortress.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2003-08-10T00:00:00Z","","Neat set but a little small.  I like the inn itself but don't care much for the connecting wall with opening.  I particularly like the roof, front door in blue and single shuttered windows -adds to the flavor of the set.  Don't care much for the set of figures.  I'd prefer an inn keeper as opposed to a knight.  Guards are ok.  Great playability and a good price.  Seems very small next to the blacksmith shop.  Maybe reversing the sets might be more appropriate (larger inn, smaller blacksmith shop).  In any case, a nice addition to your medieval village or keep.  Would like to see more sets like this to create that village.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-10T12:50:54Z","Even better than the Black Falcon's Fortress!","Never was there a better moderate sized set! This is *the* set to buy at least 4 copies of!  All the figures are excellent and also varied, and it has lots of special parts.  I'd rather have 5 of these than a Harry Potter castle any day! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-04-04T08:19:00.647Z","A true Legend","Yes, there's a wall in this set which can be connected to the rest of the castle sets with walls, but this set is more than the wall!  This set actually has a little house that's setup as a tavern.  Granted there isn't much inside - no beds, only a big table and two bricks that can be used as pretend stools... but there is a fireplace and there is a sheltered part that can be used as a stable for the horse.

This set is atypical in a few other ways - it is one of the first to include Lego flowers, for example, and the only one with red corner/45&#186; walls and of course, one of the few sets with a female minifig.  This set is great in so many ways that when they were looking for a set to launch Legends, they picked this one out of the many Castle sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-11-25T14:01:03.437Z","First Lego Legend","Many people know this set as the first Lego Legend. This is really a perfect set for so many reasons. First, the inn looks fantastic inside and out. Second, there are alot of minifigs to bring fun to this set. Finally, it is perfect for the Classic castle fan in mind. No wonder this set was the first Lego Legend.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"LegoMunchy88","2011-06-03T16:44:10.183Z","It's Called a Legend For a Reason","<p>The Guarded Inn is an amazing set, one that I didn't think I'd like until a bought it, but now I really like it. Lego's best Legends set, the Guarded Inn really deserves a prime spot in the history of Lego. Now, on to the review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minifigs</strong></p>
<p>Archer Knight: My personal favorite minifigure of the set, with a very simple, but nice design. </p>
<p>Spear Knight: A nice figure, nothing too special, but a nice figure. </p>
<p>Tavern Owner Lady: My second favorite figure in the set, with great parts (The head thingy and old cape), and a nice design.</p>
<p>??? Knight: Is this guy a Black Falcon, since there's a Black Falcon shield in the set, or is he with the other knights? I don't know, but he does have the Black Falcons color scheme....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well, apparently this set was the release of flowers to the Lego world. I'm sure that was a very big deal back then, but not a big deal for me, since, by the time I got this set, I had already seen tons and tons of Lego flowers, but it does make me appreciate how far Lego has come. And those wall pieces are simply amazing, the inside is nice, and I like how they hinged the wall so that it could open to provide more room. The table is nice, but I wish there was some kind of food, but maybe Lego didn't have food when this set was originally released.&nbsp;The castle part is also nice, although I can't put it to its full potential because I don't have a Classic Castle yet...(although I really want King's Mtn. Fortress and Black Knight's Castle)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the Guarded Inn is a great set. But if you are buying the remake, like I did, know that there was a misprint in some of them and you could end up with the Indian Horse from the Western theme. I think it's cool to have a misprint, but some apparently do not. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
