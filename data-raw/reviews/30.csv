"A_Brickset_user","2003-07-22T00:00:00Z","","As I not so patiently waited for this set to be shipped, I got my train layout ready for the action! This is a beautiful set, regardless of the name.  If you don't like train sets, I'd recommend that you don't waste your time reviewing this set - although it would probably make a great building for a city.  I'll rate this according to subject:
MODEL/DESIGN: 10 - The design, detail, and architecture of this building is very nice.  I esp. like the roofs, which easily lift off making the interior assessable.  The color combination (although I've never been fond of RED buildings reminding me of Lego fire stations) is nice.  The red mixed with dark and light gray pieces highlighted with smoked windows and doors make for nice color.  Not too bright, but definitely modern.  The tools inside are detailed.  The overall size is also wonderful.  This has got to be my largest single building next to maybe the Western Fort.  
PLAYABILITY: 10 (if you like trains).  The set has numerous tools, good space inside for minifigs, two minifigs, the two sets of large doors, and the four removable roof pieces (mentioned above) make for a lot of train track fun (not to mention the ability to also open the set although one probably would not do so once the set is attached to your track layout.
PIECES: 10 - good color combination of mostly standard bricks.  No silly round pieces or big ugly BURPS.  Good selection of doors, windows, and fences for grates.
ALTERNATIVE MODELS: N/A.  This set takes a while to build at 633 pieces and not sure I want to disassemble it to build something else.  In fact, I’m not sure if I feel like building it again any time soon.
ARES FOR IMPROVEMENT:  1) length for engines like the Super Chief.  The Super Chief definitely takes more than just two pieces of track in length.  I had to add an additional piece of straight track behind the shed for the Super Chief (not an issue if you run the train all the way through (as part of a loop)).  2) bumper stops at the end of each set of track would be nice to ensure that your engines don't fall off the track on the faster approaches.  3) the front openings do require an additional straight track on each side.  Trains cannot come in after turning.  They will hit the side.  4) The coffee pot does have to be turned to get the Super Chief inside.  It will hit the pitcher/glass if not.  5) The MOT red caboose is too tall for the building.  I never realized this little caboose was so tall.  6) The working crane is flimsy and hard to turn (I guess my hands are not as small as they used to be).  7) The gas tank contraption that is shown on the luggage dolly doesn't stay on very well.  8) And lastly, maybe some large new doors that get a little closer to the track.  Robber minifigs can easily break in and hijack an engine.
OVERALL, this set is definitely a 10 in my book.  It is a large, detailed, and unique set.  I hope that Lego designs more sets similar to this starting with a better train station.  CHOO CHOO!

"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-12T08:00:05Z","FINALLY!!!","I just completed building this set and all I can say is: AWESOME!!!  Now to the details.

The build is fairly easy and pretty quick. Building the walls and roof can be a little bit tedious but acceptable. The color mix is good. However, maybe they should have done it in dark red instead; from a distance it looks similar to a fire station. 

The details are great. You get a coffee machine, tool bench, lathe, drill press, vice, and a pulley mechanism. The roof is separated into 4 parts, each of which can be removed. There are plenty of windows, skylight, doors, and a sliding door.

I'm happy LEGO has finally produced a Train Shed/Depot but am more excited that they did the design like the one's from the 80's/early 90's. A classic set that any train lover should have! My only peeve is that this is sold exclusively through LEGO and is not available through other retail outlets (as of today). I wish they would stop doing all this exclusive stuff and make exceptional sets like this available to everyone!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-13T16:33:38Z","Nice building, just like the 80's","I grew up with Lego in the 80's. In the 90's Lego just look like Playmobil. In now time it was ready. Until I saw this set. Just like the old 80's again. A lot of bricks en a big building. It's my biggest building I own!!!!!! Just fit in the 12v and 9v trains.
Great detail en a good idea of those removable roofs. I'm consider to buy another one later this year. One for de 9v track (which I have) and maybe one for the 12v track. These too need repair.
Only one bad thing, bad they choose red. Most of mine Lego buildings &amp; trains are red. I hope Lego make more of these sets and for the trains too.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-25T00:19:45Z","The set of 2003","Excellent set with lots of playability. Great details and I like the way the set is hinged so it either can be a 32 x 32 or a 16 x 64 set. It's also fantastic that the roof can be removed for access to the interior.

The best thing about this set is the style. I agree with the comments so far about this set; it looks like an 80's set. IMO, the best looking sets and most fun are the one's from the 80's.

This has to be the best LEGO set for 2003!

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-10T12:29:25Z","Very Awesome Set...","I really enjoyed the smoke &quot;sky lights&quot;, the flat roof pieces,
the amount of red arches, the large black doors&quot;, and the 
amount of detail that comes with the set.

In my opinion, this is probably the VERY Best World City 
play set put out.  Too bad, it is a Shop@Home exclusive.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-19T10:40:35Z","Absolutely Amazing!!","I got this set at Christmas and I love it.  The hinge mechanism works great and it allows more possibilities.  Unlike other sets, like Grand Central Station (4513), this is a full building.  It is fun to play with, but it also looks great!  It has an immense amount of interior detail like the tools inside, the work bench, a crane, and that wonderful coffee maker.  Besides the two large doors, there are two normal doors with glass and a larger sliding one.  All the windows have realistic marks and smears on them.  The four sections of the roof can be easily removed and replaced, making it easy to access the interior.

Although a little cramped, I think this set is a must have for anyone who has a LEGO train.

And I just love that little coffee maker.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-04T13:02:52Z","Wonderful, but a tight squeeze","This has got to be one of the best Lego sets I have ever owned. It looks good contains clever ideas and is reasonably priced at 50 GBP for 633 pieces.

It has pretty much all been said. The set has been designed to be a side by side 2 road loco shed or to open out 180 degrees with the use of hinge bricks. As I made this set it was the little details inside that impressed me most see review below for list. The attention to detail and the way these details have been produced is most ingenious. There is a raised maintenance walkway on one side. However there is a down side to some of these details as I will mention. Externally there are sliding doors on one side, and all the roof sections are removable. It is a pity a different colour red was not used or a mix of greys as it is a little bright and does as, someone else says, look like a fire station.

The one major problem I can see with this set is that when you add it to your working layout, the clearance between certain locomotives and the front entrance and some of the interior details is very tight. As has been said you will need an additional straight at the front – otherwise the locos will hit the front coming off the curve from the switch. Even with the extra straight if you have the new BNSF Geep locomotive 10133 you will certainly find the handrails along the sides will not allow it to fit through the entrance unless they are folded out of the way. Luckily the Super Chief Locomotive 10020 is based on an F7A cowl design with no need for side handrails and those either side of the doors do not protrude as much so it fits. It is a pity that this playability factor did not appear to have been considered – or if it was later wider sets exacerbate the problem. Whilst it is simply a brilliant set, I must deduct one point for the disappointment of the tight clearances which make using it as part of my layout difficult. Only this morning I found the coffee-pot on the floor long after I had cleared up – it was obviously knocked off its stand by the Super Chief loco – I should have read the first review below! Just imagine what damage the wider Geep will do – sorry, but it has to be only a 9.

"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-02T00:04:03Z","looks great and works even better","this is an amazing set! there is so much detail, because there are all the tools inside. The 2 minifigs are good as well. The only trouble is that when you want to swivel it you have to take the tracks apart and that's pretty annoying. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-19T08:33:56Z","Simply grand","I have recently been drawn back into the world of LEGO as an adult, after decades away from the toy. I was drawn back in by some of the Star Wars Ultimate Collector Series models, by my appetite soon expanded. After a few months of drooling over the Train Engine Shed and Cargo Train sets, I decided to take the plunge.

I love that this train shed can function as an open-sided building for playability (my daughter likes to play with the sets once they've been constructed) or swivel to become a full, enclosed building for those (like myself) who prefer to build the models and let them stand in more of a diorama style. That clever design feature in itself lifts this set above most current LEGO play sets, as the trend of tall facade-only designs (like, for example, the Grand Central Station set, which I cannot convince myself to buy) looks somewhat silly in a diorama. Everything inside the shed is amazing, from the coffee pot and the hanging fluorescent light to the vice grip and the winch. A lot of thought went into the design here, and it shows. The finished building looks impressive standing among the train tracks, and it's fun to run the train in and through the building. The only downside is that, as has been mentioned, you must have straight rails connected to the rails leading in/out of the building to avoid collisions with incoming trains and the doorways of the shed, and a standard train set does not come with enough straight rails to add the shed into the loop in the open-sided configuration. So be prepared to buy more track right away if that's how you'd like your set-up to be. Since that's more a practical consideration than something that detracts from the set itself, I have no problem giving this set a solid 10. A fun build of an inspired model. It is simply grand.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
