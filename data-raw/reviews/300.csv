It`s got some detail on it, but compare it to Turaga Matau`s Noble Mahiki and it falls flat on its face. As does the rest of this set when compared to my other Turaga. The colors are not good: if he comes from the Land of Ice and Snow, Ko-Wahi, shouldn`t there be more white? Instead it`s grey grey grey, and then white feet and an unimpressive white pickaxe. Unimpressive things in a very average set.
Overall, Nuju does not tickle me pink. He`s boring. Really, you should only get him if you`ve got all the other Turaga or you`re a fan of the Ice characters.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
