"Novelty","2007-09-04T09:21:17.863Z","Bull's Away!","This is a nice size Catapault, and although it is not as large as the sleek black 6030 catapault, this one trades off sleek black for a nice design.  The wooden brown wheels with hubcaps is interesting visually, and they stand out despite being on the same level as horned horse head in the front of the catapault.  The horsehead armor thing can be removed and a horse hitched to pull the machine, which is cool.  The bucket used to hold the missiles is adequately big enough to comfortably manipulate the bricks that have been provided as the &quot;rocks&quot; to be hurled.  However, the business end, where it is depressed to launch the &quot;rocks&quot; is a bit short and thus hard to make the catapault work.  That seems to be the only gripe in the set.  The set rounds off using crossbows as decoration on the &quot;tower&quot; - it doesn't even look like a tower at all.  And there's a bucket for the odds and ends (aka weapons and a shield)",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"mrmitch","2008-02-11T02:53:28.623Z","Much needed fire power for the bad guys","The catapult work pretty well, it is stable enough to fling bricks quite a distance. Besides getting some big sets, it was hard to come by the bad knights, not alot of sets out at the time. I do enjoy this set and is a must to help balance the good/bad in a fair fight.  Worth having..",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-17T11:27:40.46Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom I) - Catapult Crusher Review","This set is a really cool little set. It's also cool for army building. It doesn't have many play features in this set but it's very easy to build and to play with. This model also has some neat weapons which you can use for the knight who comes with this set. The minifig looks really cool. I really like his brown eye patch which would also look good on a pirate minifig. The only play feature you get is that the shovel of this catapult can be moved up and down to launch the rocks on your enemies. It's a nice set and I really can't complain much about it. You also don't get any stickers to worry about.<br><br>All
in all this set is an good set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"wipefeetnmat","2011-03-13T18:19:42.95Z","awsome little knight set","<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I own one of these with a box and one that has unfortunately gone to the parts bin. Here are some of the Pros and Cons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pros: Plenty of weapons and armour for the guy to equip himself with.</p>
<p>Cool bull warrior minifig.</p>
<p>Catapult is very... Usable.</p>
<p>Plenty of ammo for catapult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cons: Could use a ""good"" knight minifig.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is an amazing addition to any Lego Castle collection.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,4,5
"Hashem1983","2021-01-16T21:20:19.093Z","Reliving Old Memories","<p>I found this set on Amazon and I have hesitated at first on buying it, however, I did it for the sake of the parts.<br />
<br />
The box when I received it was a bit worn away maybe because of how it was stored, but it was never opened,&nbsp;when I opened the box it was like a time machine as beside the instruction booklet I have found 2 leaflets inside and one of them is a mini-catalog of sets and themes, today we find those adverts inside the instruction booklet.<img alt="""" src=""file:///C:/Users/Win%2010/Downloads/IMG_0671.jpg"" /><br />

<p><br />
<strong>Parts:</strong><br />
The quality of the materials of the part felt a bit different, as I started to sense so the difference between the old and the new bricks, especially when the old parts are used for the first time as new.</p>

<p><br />
I was so touched when I saw the white wheel that contained the horns and the feather when the last time I saw this wheel was when I opened my <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/48290"">6085</a> box&nbsp;that contained the knights plumes.<br />
<a href=""https://i.imgur.com/fcMbotc.jpeg"">https://i.imgur.com/fcMbotc.jpeg</a></p>

<p><br />
The accessories like the Shield, chrome sword, and the long grey&nbsp;battleax are completely new to me as I never had them before. It also contained a spear, 2 crossbows, and a barrel.<br />
I loved the use of the tall shield&nbsp;style beside a protection form but it could be used as a sort of banner when you slide anything behind it like a stick or a spear.</p>

<p><br />
In Addition, the red horse gear, catapult arm, the wing section front, and the 4 round wheels with the holes on the side are also considered new parts to my collection, I even tried adding the horse headgear on my horses, but it did not work with the new horse.<br />
<a href=""https://i.imgur.com/08No6EK.jpeg"">https://i.imgur.com/08No6EK.jpeg</a><br />
<br />
The only extra part that was in the set was a technic pin.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure:</strong><br />
The set comes in one grumpy minifigure with only 1 print on the front side of the torso and black legs. The headgear was also a new piece for me, however, the piece is always loose and that&#39;s nothing wrong with the helmet itself as I tried it on several minifigures that I have, old and modern and it stayed just fine, the issue was with the whole on top of the head which is a reason for not staying stable on the top of the head.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build:</strong><br />
The building experience was a bit straight forward and nothing challenging, however, it only became interesting when I started building the alternate models that are on the backside of the box, 2 out of the 3 models I had no issue with.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Complete Model:</strong><br />
It turned out to be a nice model, even the alternate models, the catapult function works properly, even when it rolled, it did perfectly fine on both hard and soft surface like my desk and the carpet as I didn&#39;t expect it to roll on a desk.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>All in All</strong><br />
The price that I paid for the set was expensive, as it did cost me 10 times than the original price of its original release, however for the original price the set is worthy, I am not going to complain about the figure, but if there&#39;s something that I didn&#39;t like is the graphics on the shield that represents the bull, I think Lego that time was trying to go into a different and new direction, but in the end, it is a nice set.</p>
