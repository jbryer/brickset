"Bogdan501st","2020-06-04T09:16:31.32Z","Beautiful","<p>There is not really much to say about this set. It kind of speaks for itself. But it&#39;s not one of those cases when what you see is what you get. Well, technically, it is, but what I am trying to say is that the helmet looks way better in real life than it does on the box.</p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m not a huge fan of the 18+ box art. The LEGO logo placed in the lower-left hand corner wasn&#39;t a smart decision. Moreover, the Stormtrooper isn&#39;t shown in its full glory on the box. I&#39;d recommend displaying it below eye level, because it looks best when seen from above. Mine sits on my desk at the moment.</p>

<p>I was surprised to see how accurate and recognizable this helmet is. After all, that is what it was made for. It is purely a display piece and its sole purpose is to look great. And it does a magnificent job! It is simply beautiful!</p>

<p>As for the building process, it can get a little repetitive because of the symmetry, but I didn&#39;t find myself being bored. It is very satisfying to watch the helmet come together and I suggest you took a step back and analyse your work evey now and then.</p>

<p>The stickers are painful to place. But I must say I&#39;m glad they are stickers, because if it were for prints, you could never get the continuity of the &quot;moustache&quot; in the front. Yes, it requires a stressful amount of attention, but hey, at&nbsp;the end the effort is worth it. You have to very carefully align the stickers at the margin of the 2x1 plates. Huge credit to JANGBRiCKS for suggesting you should place those stickers after you have placed the plates.</p>

<p>So here&#39;s the thing. Remember last year&#39;s Darth Vader bust? (LEGO 75227) This one COMPLETELY overshadows that one. It is better in EVERY SINGLE WAY. Oh man, this set is just great...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t own the other two sets just yet, so I can&#39;t tell you which one you should buy. But you mustn&#39;t miss them!&nbsp;Buy one of them! They&#39;re&nbsp;not too big, they&#39;re&nbsp;not that expensive and they are(at least this set) magnificent! I really fell in love with the <em>Stormtrooper Helmet</em>!!!</p>

"StarKiller22515","2021-04-03T19:02:15.53Z","Shows the shadows","<p>While the overall look of the set is good, and it is designed well... there is the issue of shadows caused by the pieces. On the tie pilot helmet and the Boba Fett helmet the shadows are nit as noticeable due to the darker colours, but one the storm trooper helmet the white really makes te shadows stand out. Nonetheless, this is a very good-looking display piece and a must-have for the helmet collection.</p>

"_Nedski_","2023-02-15T14:43:39.14Z","Awesome","<p>647 piece build,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stickers are an issue, but work with what you get given... Bricks could be printed for better finished product. Only a small criticism but that&#39;s my opinion.</p>

<p>Another classic must have</p>
