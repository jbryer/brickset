The boxes are beautiful, which is fitting for Empire&#39;s 40<sup>th</sup> anniversary. Perhaps you may not care what the boxes look like, but I&#39;m a bit of a &#39;box aficionado&#39; (no puns in your head, please) even if I do say so myself. And, I have to say, these boxes&nbsp;look great. The design is delectable, the lighting of the products, divine, and the desire to open them and not open them at the same time, devastating. I ask myself over and over, &#39;Why couldn&#39;t Lego have made them just a bit uglier, <i>why</i>?&#39; But I already know what&#39;s going to happen, it&#39;s a foregone conclusion. Despite having told myself that no way would I open them, It&#39;s not gonna&#39; happen. Boba Fett is calling to me.</p>

<p>First impressions, the box is more than big enough for the 5&nbsp;poly bags (more on this later) and&nbsp;within several of the poly bags are extra poly bags with some of the smaller&nbsp;pieces. The instruction manual is a really nice high quality one, and easy enough to follow, as you&#39;d no doubt expect from Lego.</p>

<p>Onto the build. It was a very interesting build, and never boring or repetitive, so that was a big plus.&nbsp;In total, this took me about two hours and a half+, your time may vary. I was hindered by my girlfriend bugging me by asking me all the time if she could&nbsp;&#39;help&#39; me. Lego City, okay, Boba Fett, I don&#39;t think so. Word to the wise, don&#39;t ever say to your girlfriend or wife, &#39;Just try one Lego set, you might like it.&#39; because she probably will, and then never leave you alone when you&#39;re about to build something. I only managed to dissuade her through bribery, I&#39;m now into her for one &#39;Steamboat Mickey&#39; Lego set. My cat didn&#39;t help me much either, and kept moving pieces I&#39;d placed ready everywhere else. The construction of this set is pleasingly non-linear though, and has some surprising build choices, particularly the yellow and green feature on the side of the helmet, that is held together via two brick hooks and an internal yellow&nbsp;bar. At first this seemed precarious, but after other elements were attached, it was very firm. I liked the initial red and white bricks that made up the internal cuboid structure, but this is probably because I started wondering when Lego was going to get the license to make a Tintin &#39;Destination Moon&#39; rocket set, or any other Tintin set at all.</p>

<p>The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: I&#39;ll start with the bad first. At its price point, I think ten dollars cheaper would have been perfect. It is a little small, although the stand does help with this. I would have liked it 0.5 larger. The movable grey stem for the black eyepiece comes off at a whim. The box was large, and the poly bags barely filled 3/4 of it. I don&#39;t blame them for making the box bigger, it was a wise marketing choice at the price point they are using. The sides of the helmet (the cheek areas) are not very sturdy, bearing in mind they are attached to the main structure with one tiny hook/clasp, but since you probably won&#39;t be playing much with it, then as a display piece there&#39;s no big problem with that.</p>

<p>The ugly... well. The black eyepiece on the moveable grey stem looks like it&#39;s tight next to the grey stem in all the advertising/box design, online promo shots&nbsp;etc. It&#39;s not, that&#39;s Photoshop. There&#39;s a slightly unsightly gap in-between it. But, that&#39;s not my big problem. The triangular eyepiece is. Particularly, the way it&#39;s attached to the grey stem with only a 2 stud piece on the flat of the triangular black piece. Every time you move the triangular eye piece, it comes off. I have no idea why they didn&#39;t choose a 4 stud piece as this would have solved the issue. I find it hard to believe no Lego designer brought this up, especially with all the work that has gone into it. This was one of the last pieces, and kind of disappointing in that regard. I&#39;ve also no idea why a nice flat piece wasn&#39;t used instead of the undersides of 2, two stud flats facing forwards.</p>

<p>The Good. Phew, okay, it has to be said that apart from the above, this is a beautiful piece and whoever designed this has the soul of an artist. The colors are just loooovely, and although it is&nbsp;a touch small, Boba Fett is reassuringly heavy for his size. The name plate is printed - no sticker -&nbsp;and the stand can be easily detached so you can have the plate forward in a side profile of the helmet if you wish. How do I feel overall? Great build, beautiful rendering of Boba Fett&#39;s helmet, but probably should have been a touch cheaper. Am I complaining? No, I love it.&nbsp;If you&#39;re a Boba Fett fan, get it, you&#39;ll regret it if you don&#39;t.</p>

"starwars4ever2","2020-05-06T22:06:33.203Z","One of the Best Sets I've Built in a While","<p>The title is pretty self-explanatory, but let me explain why.</p>

<p>Starting of, the building techniques are phenomenal. The way the designer uses SNOT techniques in this set are truly awe-inspiring. I loved constructing the sides of the helmet in particular, and the creative ways the build slowly covers up its extremely colorful interior make it really fun to put together overall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only is the build great, but the parts are wonderful too. I can never get enough of sand green in my set, and that&#39;s what this set mostly consists of. Sure there are a lot of on by ones/twos, but there&#39;s also some very diverse parts as well. Overall, if you&#39;re not impressed with the build (somehow, I don&#39;t think that&#39;s possible) you still have a wonderful parts pack that will be extremely&nbsp;useful for any half-decent MOC builder.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While there are no minifigs in this set, I am still very impressed by the value one gets for their $60. When I first saw pictures of this set I was impressed, and the rumor was that it was going to cost $70. I was still fully prepared to pay that $70, and now having it in hand I can happily report that I still would have been worth that $70. Crazy right? Me, an experience fan of Lego, saying that I would actually pay MORE for something rather than complain about the price. Unheard of...</p>

<p>I don&#39;t usually write reviews on Brickset, in fact I&#39;ve only ever written one previously nearly two and a half years ago, but this set inspired me to write this. So while it may not be everyone&#39;s cup of tea, if you&#39;re an AFOL who likes displayable sets that look amazing, or are even a slight fan of Star Wars, I highly recommend you pick up this set.&nbsp;</p>

"pitcovich","2021-01-06T21:00:26.18Z","Beautiful and polished model","<p>This thing is absolutely amazing. This is the perfect display model for a Star Wars fan of any kind but lets get down to business.</p>

<p>-Building experience, This set is a little difficult&nbsp;to build. The instruction backround is black so it is hard to see the colors of the parts because some colors are very similar shades. The build is very relaxing and time passing as most sculptures are, the plaque could not be better.</p>

<p>-Parts, This set has a lot of sand green pieces which is always nice to get and some dark red pieces but not much to say about the parts.</p>

<p>-displayability, obviously this set cannot be played with but you can tilt&nbsp;the antennae down to the face. This set is great for displaying on a shelf and can&nbsp;add flare and texture to any Star Wars fans room.</p>

<p>-Overall thoughts, I love this set and it is absolutely worth the money and makes and Star Wars fans room look awesome. I would probably say this is the best of the current helmet series (more coming&nbsp;later in 2021) and I highly recommend this set.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"J14T14","2020-09-01T04:42:24.443Z","He's no good to me dead","<p>I was really interested when LEGO announced that they would be making some 18+ sets. Growing up with LEGO, I was excited to see them go after the AFOL market. Im my opinion, these helmet sets do a pretty good job at attracting that market. This set especially is the best one out of all of them. The Iron Man and Stormtroooer helmets are a bit off and the TIE Pilot, while good-looking, is not as iconic as some&nbsp;other troopers. But this Boba Fett helmet is perfect. It looks exactly how we all remember him and the building process is interesting as well. While it wasn&#39;t too challenging, it did have a few techniques that may be challenging for younger builders. The yellow stripes on the side of the helmet were especially interesting to put together. I also like how the design of this helmet also opens it up to people to follow the basic template and build their own Mandalorian helmet. I can&#39;t wait to see people make Sabine Wren, The Mandalorian, Jango Fett, or even some Maul-dalorians based on this set. Overall i recommend this set over all the other helmets, and if you can get it for less than the $60 retail price, then I would say that you shouldn&#39;t pass this one up!</p>

"StarKiller22515","2021-04-03T19:24:22.817Z","He's no good to me dead","<p>So far this is one of if not the best of the helmet line. The rangefinder can go up and down which is the only moving part on the helmet sets so far. The sand green is a nice colour for the faded green of his helmet and a colour of pieces that we do not get too often. The shaping and the shaping of the colours around the visor is dang near perfect while still maintaining that &ldquo;LEGO&rdquo; charm. The way they built up the markings on the side is very good as well. Not to mention the great detail of the dent in his helmet from his duel with Cad Bane. This is an absolute must buy if you like Star Wars or if you are collecting the helmet line.</p>

"NYBuilder","2021-03-04T15:53:07.073Z","Absolutely stunning","<p>This is an absolutely stunning collectors piece. The best out of the three which were released, pictures do not do this set justice. Having an interaction portion as well with the movable antenna. This is a complex and rewarding build that leaves you with a fine addition to your collection.</p>

"CommisarRoberts","2021-05-20T14:52:43.86Z","A great display piece","<p>Bought for me as a birthday present by my best friend.</p>

<p>This set is a very fun 5 - Bag build. It can&nbsp;be a little fiddly at times but that is&nbsp;part of the fun. Once completed this set looks brilliant as a display piece and its very fun to watch Fetts helmet come together as the set is assembled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While not the most tricky set in the world it takes some time and devotion so id recommend this too older or more mature builders.</p>

<p>A great set for any Star Wars fan/.</p>

"Alucard_Tepes","2022-06-20T16:00:12.903Z","75277-1: Boba Fett Helmet","<p>Got this for my birthday, and it&#39;s really cool,&nbsp;especially if you&#39;re a fan of Boba Fett or Mandalorians. But the set itself isn&#39;t all grand but still nice. Though be patience with building because I got confused since the instructions has so many green parts going in specific places. I don&#39;t have an opinion on parts but the sculpt is good. This is a display bust so there&#39;s no playability aside from you can move the rangefinder up and down. I think the set is good for what it&#39;s worth. I think is one of the better helmets that&#39;s been released so far. Looks really great with my Mandalorian collection.</p>

"TMYM","2021-07-25T11:10:18.077Z","The best helmet, but not perfect","<p>This is the best lego boba fett helmet they could&#39;ve done. The gap between the visor and the red border is the only issue, but it&#39;s easy to ignore. I also think the shape isn&#39;t perfect, and that it should&#39;ve been slightly wider at the bottom.&nbsp;</p>

"William20o9","2022-03-19T23:35:41.97Z","Great for money, not for kids","<p>This is a great set for older kids and adults, but not so much for young kids. Same with the rest of the helmets and art series. They are for display. Not saying this can&#39;t be played with. With other helmets, you could have quite a good time. The use of parts are amazing, it&#39;s a shame it&#39;s so hard to build.</p>

<p>If you are over 12 and a Star Wars fan, I recommend this set.</p>
