Unfortunately, it is also the last one at the moment. In the next issue there will be another one Owen minifig, but I hope, that in future LEGO will come back and make some more great set like this.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>Triceratops looks exactly like it should. It has its horns, this big leather collar, and nice rounded&nbsp;tail. Head is designed perfectly. It is a bit rounded on the corners thanks to new quarter-round tile. I also really like the way they made nose of this dino. It is so simple, yet looks fantastic. Horn on the nose is a bit to bulky, but is isn&#39;t a big mistake. Whole head can be easily turned around, and again, like in the case of T-rex, there is an awful looking grey ball joint. I wish they start making those parts in more proper colors.</p>

<p>Body is very simple, just some bricks stuck one on another. Colouring of this creature is much better than T-rex&#39;s, green-tan combo looks much cleaner. Tail is made well, with two cones in green, which I believe is a new color.</p>

<p>Legs are also designed perfectly. Front legs seem shorter due to placement of pin hole. They are nicely rounded and have cute toes done with cheese slope. Rear legs are much simpler, but still have great look. They are using fair amount of curved bricks, that make them look more natural. There are also some bricks in color other than on the rest of body, (light and dark green), that make nice looking stains on his body.But also here there are ugly grey parts.</p>

<p>Model is design mostly as a standing thing, but I feel like children would enjoy playing with it. It&#39;s sturdy model, I don&#39;t see any weaker parts. Legs have small range of movement, but allows dino to pose a bit (it can stand on front legs).</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>65 in total, no spare. Many green bricks make this set quite worthy. Some of them are unique, like&nbsp;<a href=""https://rebrickable.com/parts/28192/slope-45-2-x-1-with-23-inverted-cutout-and-no-stud/"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab."">28192</a>&nbsp;in lime green, or quarter-round tile in green. Also, horns look great. It is a good parts source.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Great looking set, looks great next to recent T-rex, is quite playable and has awesome parts. Set is clearly worth its price (~$4).</p>
