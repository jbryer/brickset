This set is cool because you get 3 cool guys, a grey ninja, a ruffy dude with a doo rag, and a commando guy with the best helmet. In this set you get a little ferry looking thing that two ninja's carry. The grey guy is the enemie and he ambushes. It is cool and you can make some wicked ambushes. It is pretty small and comes with some good little effects. Itz a good nab, get this little set if you want good action.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-07-16T06:42:47.997Z","Shuriken","This interesting little set has a stretcher being carried by two soldiers.  Atop the stretcher is a treasure chest, but this treasure chest is very different from the usual treasure chests, but seems to be a Japanese version of it chained and guarded with a katana.  The colours are pleasant and the design is interesting.  What's not so interesting is the rock bit and that seems to be included almost as an afterthought for the ninja to hide behind and pillage the stretcher as it goes past.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-07-07T09:26:40.497Z","Ninja's stolen treasure","This set was released in 1998, and is a small set that is a part of the Ninja subtheme, Castle theme. At the first view it looks like to be unfinished and simple (really, it is very simple, but it is because is a small set), but it is playable and useful also, more to the Ninja subtheme collectors.

This set includes three minifigures, two robbers and a gray ninja. Each minifigure have different details, altough the two robbers have a common red scheme in the parts. The details aren't much, but aren't few, these are very well expressive and good to Lego minifigures, sometimes very much details makes the minifigures worst, it still cool without much details. One of the robbers have a &quot;shogun helmet&quot; and the other have a cap. Each pieves are black, and useful to any theme. About the ninja, this have a gray color and the common ninja details, and cover. Also, this minifigure have two katana swords, and one can be guarded at the back of the minifigure, making a cool effect in the design. The three minifigures are really good overall.

Now, about the building, there is few building involved, but all pieces included are useful. The &quot;treasure&quot; is made by few pieces, and is really simple, but have a good design at all, due to the pieces used and also details. In the base (a black small plate connects all), are connected two red pieces with parts to the minifigures hang and carry. The minifigures can hang well in it without dismantle easily when playing. In the center, there are more pieces making a part with brown details, and is putted there a gray chain, just to add more effects in the design, to makes it a bit more reallistic. Above, there are more pieces. At the sides, there is a brwon spear, and in the other is a joust spear, with a detailed &quot;flag&quot; connected to it. This treasure don't have much stuff, but some pieces makes it a bit more reallistic, and the design is nice. Also about the playability, but the building isn't great.

The little building included as a hidden location for the ninja, made by several gray pieces, is also, very small and not that great in building, also in playability, but at least it have a good design from the late 90's years, and useful pieces, like the green leafs. With only 9 pieces youcan make it. Well, it is really small, could be increased a bit more, but it still very useful to any set, especially Ninja, adventurers, Castle, and also Indiana jones (can be a small addition to the temples). This part is overall useful.

The playability is good, at least decent, due to the pieces used fix very well each one to other. Overall, the set is very useful, playable, and have a nice design, altough is really small. But it isn't a great problem, so, if you find it by a few less than 10 US$, and if you wish to get some stuff from the ninja theme, or just to get some stuff from the 90's times, it can be a great set. At least a 4,7 it deserves for a small set, it is very good. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Bricktoothyo","2008-11-22T22:26:04.437Z","Tip Top Set","I got this set very cheap on ebay.
As a stand alone set it is really good-On the minifig side you get a grey ninja,a master and robber swordsman guy-and thats enough to have your own little battle right there.
The treasure transport itself is a cool piece,and the little rockery thing the ninja hides behind is great and useful in many themes.
Couldnt help but give this a 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-17T13:38:16.643Z","Treasure Transport Review","<p>When Lego first introduced the Oriental Sub-theme for Castle with Samurai and Ninjas, I was very excited and still am.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get 3 minifigures in the way of 2 soldiers and a grey ninja. This set for the grey ninja was worth as it breaks away from the obvious black or white ninjas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a rock outcropping for the Ninja to hide behind before he leaps out and attacks the two soldiers carrying the gold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yes, the treasure inside the transport box is the Pirate theme gold coins in a transparent tube element. While the soldiers do have weapons, they could have been better armed or prepared to draw weapons at the first sign of ambush. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still all in all it's a great set for its size and the scenarios that can be played out with it.</p>",TRUE,4,5,4,5,4
"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T16:37:27.55Z","Ninja Steals Pirate Gold","<p>Set #6033 Treasure Transport: Long ago, in the time of ancient Gods, Warlords and Kings... Ninjas swept in to steal Pirate Gold from neredowells in ancient Japan. Or is it China? I can never remember who originated the idea of the Ninja. Ah well, this is the only other set aside from Samurai Swordsman I own from the Ninja Sub-Theme. (I'm hoping to collect most of them eventually.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set offers up something interesting, you get two bad guys and another bad guy who's out to steal their gold. (I'm still not sure if the Ninjas of the Ninja theme were good or bad, but the Robbers were definitely bad.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Construction wise you build the tiny ambush concealment thing for the Ninja and then the Treasure Transport which gives the set it's name. Not much really to build, but it can offer endless hours of fun play. Mine has seen better days, the plants are broken with missing stems and the treasure is loose inside of the transport because I lost/misplaced the little transparent topper for the gold case. (You can't see it in the pictures.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get two Robber Mini-Figures and a Gray Clad Ninja, plus you are given a spear, three katana and a lance/flagpole. As far as accessories go not a lot, but nothing to cry about either. This is one of few sets that used stickers also to add details to the pieces and even after ten + years mine are still looking good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Ninja theme was a great addition to Castle and I can't wait to see the new NinjaGo in person, hopefully it will - if not match - then at least live up to the spirit of the original Ninja theme. This set is recommended to all, it's relatively inexpensive these days I think, or just keep looking around for a good bargain deal.</p>",TRUE,5,4,3,5,4

On the top of the container is a slot where you can slide two katanas through and on the one side is a brown spear and on the other side is a nice plastic flag which is double-printed.
