<p>Issue 25 of the Lego City Comic comes with a small bulldozer build and Carl Concrete.&nbsp; The set contains 27 pieces and is a nice little build that younger kids are sure to enjoy.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The image of the Carl and the bulldozer on the front of the foil packet shows the set well.&nbsp; I think all four wheels maybe should have been on the ground to ensure that the bulldozer works to its full potential.&nbsp; Carl seems pretty happy with himself and in the background there is a tower crane and large construction project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It also states on the front that this is a limited edition and it is for ages 5+.&nbsp; I think this is too high, especially as the only other City Construction set this year is the 4+ 60252 Construction Bulldozer which this set compliments.</p>

<p>The back has the standard safety information, which includes a symbol saying it&#39;s not ages 0-3&nbsp;and the 1:1 image is of one of the two 1x1 Reddish Brown round plates included within the set that imitate the mud.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Considering the set is called Eddy Erker with Bulldozer I was a little surprised to see that the comic calls the construction worker Carl Concrete.&nbsp; His torso and legs last appeared in City Construction sets in 60152: Sweeper &amp; Excavator from 2017.&nbsp; His head currently appears in 28 sets and the white hat he wears is in 22 sets.&nbsp; I always think you should get an extra hair element for the sets on the comics to add playability.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>The build is simple enough for just over 20 parts.&nbsp; The only part you can&#39;t see from the front of the packet is a 1X2 transparent red plate used at the back of the bulldozer.&nbsp; I think the wheels on this are too wide for a set of this size and the spoiler&nbsp;piece used at the front seems too small.&nbsp; A proper seat could have added to the set as well, but it is ok without.</p>

<p>There are no parts that are super rare, however the spoiler used at the front only appears in 14 sets in this colour.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>Certainly a huge improvement on the last offering, but minor changes could improve it.&nbsp; It is good to get a couple of extra parts to use as the mud, even if it is only two 1x1 studs.&nbsp; This is a fun little set which is exactly what these comics should be about.&nbsp; This is only the second time we have had a construction set on the comics since Issue 2!</p>

<p>If you can get this then I certainly recommend it.&nbsp; A version of this could be made quite simply from most collections if you can&#39;t get hold of one as most of the parts are very common.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inside the back of the comic it shows that we will get two Minifigures with Issue 26 - a policeman and crook.</p>
