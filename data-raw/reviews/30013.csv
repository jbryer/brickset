"TeddytheSpoon","2020-11-30T17:59:06.76Z","TIE pilot helmet will please AFOLs and casual fans alike","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The build: </b>this is the first of LEGO&rsquo;s new helmet range I bought, and I was expecting the build to essentially be a bigger Brickheadz: a core of modified bricks with studs, with plates on the outside. While there is some truth to this &ndash; the core is indeed made up of modified bricks with studs &ndash; the scale of the helmets coupled with the limitations of the LEGO brick makes the build a surprisingly engaging process. There is enough variety between plates, wedges and slopes to stop it from feeling tedious, and even the tedious bit (namely the breather tubes, made up of just under 40 small train wheels) is such an effective representation of the source material it is entirely worth it. The only drawback is that the black plates and bricks on plates that make up the outer surface will require your full attention to make sure you don&rsquo;t make a mistake, although the instructions do helpfully highlight which pieces are new to a given step. <b>9/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Display value:</b> the helmet series was one of the first in LEGO&rsquo;s attempts to corner what I will call the &lsquo;ANFOL&rsquo; market (Adult but-Not-really-a-Fan Of LEGO), with sets designed to look less like a toy and more like a display piece. The choice of helmets at this scale has wound up being rather well-suited to the task: big enough to be detailed and interesting builds, but small enough to be effective desk ornaments; and not overly expensive, especially for the number of pieces in the set (#75274 in fact has the best price-per-piece ratio of the three 2020 Star Wars helmets). The TIE fighter pilot&rsquo;s helmet is well represented, and the texturing in particular is used to great effect to define the various features of the imperial ace. In short &ndash; it looks terrific. <b>9/10</b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Overall verdict: </b>One of the key aims of LEGO&rsquo;s move towards ANFOLs (I&rsquo;m going to try and make that stick) seems to be a shift in perceptions about their product. The TIE fighter pilot helmet, with its slick black packaging and foreword in the instructions (including a diagram showing how a brick separator works), certainly feels like a premium product relative to LEGO&rsquo;s other, more play-focussed offerings. A gratifying build process combined with an unobtrusive yet attractive display piece makes #75274 a success. So much so, in fact, that although I was only planning on getting the one helmet, I may just try and complete the collection&hellip; <b>9/10</b></p>

"StarKiller22515","2021-04-03T18:58:49.61Z","A great display piece","<p>So far this is one of the better helmet sets. The printed Imperial insignias on the helmet are great. The black helps hide shadows and blends the helmet together very well unlike the storm trooper helmet. The only one that might be better is the Boba Fett helmet.</p>

<p>The only reason that this helmet isn&#39;t as popular as some of the others is either because it isn&#39;t as desirable, or because it&#39;s all black, meaning the eyes and many other details aren&#39;t very noticable.</p>
