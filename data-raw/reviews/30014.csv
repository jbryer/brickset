Interesting series....","<p>Opening the packets that I splashed out way, way too much money on, (At &pound;3.45 a piece they do deserve their 3/5 value for money), however the pieces in the blind bags are quite neat. One of the ones I opened, the diver, had loads of really nice parts, including dual moulded legs, as well as a really cool turtle and some plants. The pi&ntilde;ata boy also has quite cool parts such as the new horse pi&ntilde;ata piece as well as the clothes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Pea-Pod girl that I&nbsp;opened was cool, with an exclusive torso print under the costume, much like the cactus girl minifigure. However, I was puzzled to find that the girl came with an apple (not sure what the purpose of that was...) Some of the figures are more desirable than others though, and some designs are quite odd and unappealing in my opinion. (I&#39;m sure you know which ones I mean).</p>

<p>As far as playability goes, they are good, and would fit right in in&nbsp;so many MOC&#39;s or cityscapes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Later on, after my first opening, I found some in Waitrose for a price of &pound;1.90, which was AMAZING!&nbsp;</p>

<p>To round them up, the playability is good, there are some awesome pieces although the price is very, very high.&nbsp;</p>
