She includes a brand new hair/hat element combo which has a partially to one side baseball style cap with long reddish brown hair, as with all parts of this type it hinders the ability for the Minifigure to look left or right without removing the piece first to turn the head, but it is a small price to pay for such a classic looking character.</p>

<p>She sports a mid-riff baring pink top, dual-molded legs to give the big white sneakers a proper look to them while she&#39;s sporting her dark-black stretchy style pants and she includes a teal boombox for an accessory as well as some of the unique new parts used to simulate flying. This is so you can pose her in various dance moves to simulate the breakdance style. It&#39;s not perfect, since LEGO Minifigures are nowhere near as flexible as actual people, but it serves adequately enough for the purposes of action displays.</p>

<p>Overall a very well received character and I&#39;d strongly recommend tracking her down. Her parts alone can be highly useful for some kick-butt 90s displays. A definite must-have.</p>
