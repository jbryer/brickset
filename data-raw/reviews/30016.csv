This adorably cute looking character is dressed in a new food-item costume shaped like a pod of peas with an opening cut out for the face up top. It&#39;s a very nicely sculpted element and works great, especially with the dark green legs and arms on the character.</p>

<p>Her top is printed with a bowl of salad and she includes two interesting facial expressions, one of them is a standard beaming happy smile while the other is clearly meant to indicate that she is in the middle of chewing on something, her mouth is closed in that certain way and one side looks like the cheek is full. Considering she includes an apple as an accessory it&#39;s more than likely she&#39;s eating a bite out of that. Her lips are paint with green lipstick.</p>

<p>Overall this brilliant Minifigure is worth hunting for if you missed out in 2020, I was fortunate enough to manage one despite numerous orders that ultimately left me with more of Series 20 than I&#39;d care for, but as I said she&#39;s worth it. Highly Recommended.</p>
