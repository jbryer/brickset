<p><b>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tournament Knight&nbsp;</b>is a wonderful minifigure, one of the best there has been.&nbsp;The minifig is from the cmf series 20 and is the 4th minifig in the series.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The knight represents a jousting or dueling knight, dressed in orange-yellow and black striped clothing, so he is only clothed&nbsp;for showy pretend battles. But, since these fake fights can still get a little ugly, he has chain mail armor underneath his fancy outfit. He also wears a pearl dark gray helm with a dep red feather, either dyed that color or pulled from some rare elusive bird. The minifig itself is sturdy and easy to remove from studs (it&#39;s quite fun to do that&nbsp;actually!)</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The knights face is bearded with a fine curling orange mustache and a solemn expression that is ready for his opponents in the battle ring and prepared to impress his king. But underneath that fiery mustache, he has a subtle grin, showing his determination and confidence that he will win.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But his gear are the things that tell all about him. His shield is the standard triangular shape, but the coat of arms is actually a crow on a yellow background with a red border. And&nbsp;this faction of &#39;crow knights&#39; has&nbsp;actually never before&nbsp;been seen&nbsp;in the whole of the castle theme.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But then, the most astounding piece of this minifigure is the sword. A brand new, very detailed mold of a large sword&nbsp;with a circular base, an intricate detailed and grooved hilt, a sleek curved cross guard, and a blade that slowly tapers to a fine sharp point with a slight dip in the middle of it. This mighty new mold for a sword only deserves to be put in the hands of the most talented and skilled warrior. So, therefore this proves that this knight is no ordinary fighter of an army of thousands more like him. No, he is not a knight that you can easily fool and get rid of. This is a fearless warrior who has mastered the art if battle and would be a mighty hard foe to overcome. Wouldn&#39;t it be awesome to have such a fine minifigure on your shelf or in a castle moc, fighting in a battle ring, or facing a terrifying beast?</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So, to sum it all up, this minifig is great and totally deserves a five star review, with the exclusive sword and shield, neat outfit, and shinning helmet. It is the perfect addition to any castle fans collection.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Also, is this minifig a sign that Lego will return with a new castle theme with an all new faction of knights? Maybe... but who knows what The Lego Group will do with the castle theme in the future. Although, since they have approved the Lego Ideas blacksmith shop, which should be released by March 2021, hopefully they will bring back a full line of new set if this one sells very well.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Hope you have enjoyed reading the very first &#39;Time for the Return&#39; (TftR) review! See you next time with another review, which can be expected by the end of December. Farewell, and a happy New&nbsp;Year!</p>

<p>(Note: I actually lost the exclusive shield to this minifig. As soon as I opened the poly bag, out went the shield piece into the midst&nbsp;of my other Legos. I&#39;m still looking for it, but can&#39;t find it. So if you do get the minifig, be carefull not to lose any of the pieces. A knight feels vulnerable&nbsp;without his shield!)</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-02-03T19:31:45.123Z","What Ho! A Duel You Say? Have at Thee!","<p><b>Set #71027 Tournament Knight:</b>&nbsp;This wonderful looking Castle inspired addition to Series 20 features a unique yellow and black outfit design and a shield with the sign of a crow on the front, or perhaps a raven, this is hearkening back to the old Castle theme and the Black Falcons.</p>

<p>With the standard sword and helmet design made popular in LEGO Kingdoms this Minifigure is armed for a battle, he includes a dark red plume to attach to the helmet and uses dual-molding on his legs for his boots. He includes a very impressive facial print with beard and moustache that looks new, while matching some of the past facial prints in Castle themes and past CMF offerings.</p>

<p>Overall he makes an excellent addition and I definitely recommend nabbing a handful or more for your displays/collections to swell the ranks of different factions of Knights. Highly Recommended.</p>
