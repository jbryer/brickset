<p>The minifigure is fantastic, the pants have printing on the front and sides, and I could see this element being used for other pirate figure. The torso is wonderful as well, with nice printing indicating a belt with a pouch to store...well, whatever pirates keep on their belts anyway. The head is nice as well, indicating very nice pirate expressions, one in a grin, the other in a scowl. The Tricorn hat piece is a new piece, only appearing in this set and Pirates Of Barracuda Bay. This piece depicts blond hair and a pirate hat that looks identical to the ones commonly employed in the 1980&#39;s pirate sets. This is pleasing consistency. A red feather is stuck in the top and she is equipped with a cutlass. I appreciate this element, also originating in old pirate sets, though I think she should also include a gun or a lantern, I have given her a classic flintlock pistol, she looks much better. She is given a normal CM minifigure stand in black, and you also get an extra cutlass and feather.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are looking for a fun minifigures with cool parts, or are a pirates enthusiast and looking for a way to upgrade your crew, look no further!&nbsp;</p>

The outfit looks stunning with belts and buckles galore and side-printing on the legs for stripes to match the front. She includes the standard LEGO Pirate sword accessory, no re-use for the holster that was created with the Pirates of the Caribbean Theme, which makes me question why so many LEGO Pirates are forever doomed to remain incapable of putting their swords down.</p>

<p>Her new hat/hair combo is a brilliant re-interpretation of the tri-corner hat from the old Pirates theme. She even includes a red plume to stick inside it to indicate that she may be someone of significant rank in the Pirate crew. Her expressions include happy smile with a subtle gap-tooth and scallywag scowl as she prepares to skewer you.</p>

<p>Highly Recommended.</p>
