<p><strong>Minifigure&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Starting off with her hat, which is a nice coral color, and contrasts nicely with the black hair beneath. The word &quot;SPACE&quot; is printed on the top in white, and this peice would look nice on other figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The face is wonderful as well, with an open smile on one side&nbsp;and goggles on the other with a smirk. It does look reminiscent of other city figure&#39;s begoggled faces, though I like the look it is presenting here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The torso is spectacular, displaying a classic space ship. The printing is incredibly intricate, and I love the reference. I believe it is referring to set 918. This peice has potential to be used elsewhere and is wonderful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The pants are the weakest part of the figure. The heart would look better in Friends, and the star and the planet could have been made better, though honestly, not a big deal as the rest of this minifigures makes up for it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The accesories keep the space vibe going here, with a grey&nbsp;wrench and blueprints depicting a rocket. I like the printing, and seems very realistic. The rocket depicted is actually included! This consists of a 1x1 cone in red, a white 1x1 cylinder with printing with the NASA logo, and a 1x1 red cylinder with fins. I like the inclusion of the logo, and space fans might find it useful for mocs.</p>

<p><strong>Overall&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>This is a very nice figure which harkens back to the good ol days of Lego space, and the accesories are marvelous, and space fans will appreciate the many space themed peices involved. I am not a crazy fan of classic space, though bought this figure for the wonderful kaleidoscope of peices. If you&#39;re a classic space fan, or just love cool minifigures, I would recommend picking this up. You will not regret it.&nbsp;</p>

Again.","<p><b>Set #71027 Space Fan:</b>&nbsp;Classic LEGO Space is never forgotten as long as LEGO continues to create figures and sets to keep the fans wanting more. Case in point our lovely Space Fan is dressed in a designer top with the Classic LEGO Space Ship design printed on the front, her legs include some shapes, a heart and a star and a ringed planet indicating she&#39;s made some repairs to her jeans with these patches.</p>

<p>And her cap with ponytail is a nice pink colour with the word Space written out on the front. For accessories she includes a printed tile with blueprints for a small rocket, a wrench and a buildable rocket with NASA printed on the front. (This is why the build rating is a two because there&#39;s actually a little bit more to build with this one compared to most other CMF offerings.) She&#39;s also a conscientious builder because her facial print includes a regular smiling expression and another smiling expression with safety goggles to protect her eyes.</p>

<p>Overall she&#39;s a brilliant offering and a great little addition to the LEGO Classic Space Fans display, joining the Blacktron Fan and M-Tron Fan from the LEGO Movie Themes. Highly Recommended.</p>
