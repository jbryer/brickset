"Novelty","2007-04-13T10:36:41.943Z","Patrick Swayze","A ghost, a knight and a bit of castle is really what this set is all about.  Again, it seems to be a weird mismatch of a knight and a ghost - is the ghost meant to frighten the knight or is the knight suppose to kill the ghost?  What was the intention of the set?  There's a pennant and a grey parrot in this set which agains seems at odds with each other and with the ghost and the knight.

The castle bit is nicer - basically it's just 2 castle wall corner segments put together with a technic clip to allow it to connect to the rest of the other castle wall pieces.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"legotrainfan","2007-12-06T06:18:41.327Z","Scaring the knight","Although this is a little set, it is quite good. You get a knight with one of those absolutely cool armors. The knight is fully armed and he comes with a horse. Then there is a ghost that can glow in the dark after holding it under a light for some seconds. You also get a dark gray bird. So if you feel you must have a ghost, buy this set!

This set does not come with many bricks, but you can use the two castle corner walls for your own creations. The two brown doors are also quite useful when you want to build a medieval house or church. The little thing in which the ghost is - is it a house or a castle or anything else? - can be attached to a castle due to technic bricks with holes. However, if you attach it to a castle, you must remove the lance with the blue flag as well as the plate with the clip that holds the lance. Only then can you attach it to most castles; otherwise the clip and the flag would be obstacles to attachment.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-12-07T23:31:10.53Z","Knight vs. Ghost","This for me is where castle all started. The original knight in armour to fight evil. Looking at it now it's not exactly that way but back then this was as advanced as it got and we felt in no way jipped for it.

The structure is pretty simple as other have mentioned. Basically two corners with the old school gates on the front and capping on the top. with the pieces on to it would look like a small tool shed. It also has a blue flag on a lance, a grey parrot and a Technic pin to connect with the other models. 

The knight is decked out in full armour including chest plate, helmet, shield and lance with a red flag on it. The helmet has a metal looking visor on it and a red set of feathers on top. He rides on a white horse that has a blue saddle and is carrying his sword. The shield is red, blue and yellow representing a dragon. His face is the standard smiling face.

The ghost is just cool. I have no other like him. The outer piece is one solid piece, like a sheet that has a face cut into it and glows in the dark. To fill it out it has a blank black head, plain white torso and a white block instead of legs. He clicks onto LEGO boards and dose really look a treat at night time.

Overall this model is pretty basic by today's standards and all the fancy bits we have but back then it was awesome and that's how I will always remember it. Overall a set with excellent aesthetics, good playability due to figs and accessories and a charm that can't be bought. A 7/10 from me and a must for any old school or castle fan.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"sijpe","2008-07-17T08:41:34.89Z","A very tempting little set","When the castle theme was completely revamped in 1990, this was the perfect set to get the best new gimmicks in a fairly easy way.
I, for one, was very happy to see the glorious return of helmets with separate visors. And next to the helmet, they introduced an equally good looking armour piece for the first time. On top of that there was that cute little ghost which made this set simply irressistible; even for me, a devoted lego-town man.

That black 'weather-box' that's serves as the ghost's lair is nothing more than window-dressing of course. It's of no consequence however; they could have seated the ghost in a moon-buggy, for all I cared, and I still would have bought it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Released as a mini set of the black knights subtheme in the year of 1990, this is really small and includes few pieces, but the simple design, building, color scheme and useful pieces makes this small a good set. This set includes two minifigures and these are nicely but too simple designed, that still in the lego classic minifigure style. The knight minifigure included is basically black with some details and includes a shield, joust sword with a flag and a helmet. The ghost minifigure includes a cover that features the capacity of glow in the dark and cover all the figure, but still playable. The horse minifigure is like some others and is basically white with some red details. The bird included is just a solid piece with no playability but still in a simple cool design. The few building involved in the set is a gate with some black plates, making a wall and the ghost stay inside it. Altough the set have old likeness and have few pieces, all these are useful, overall this set is good for a small and increase some castle sets. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BigTexan","2008-12-12T15:33:02.043Z","The Monarch's Ghost","Well this was one of the first sets I got as a kid, when I was about 9. Anyway I've always had a special place for this little set. The small shed can be easily modified into a much larger tower, like the gray tower in the wall of the Battering Ram set (6062). It goes really well with the Knight's Stronghold (6059) set that came out about the same time. Anyway a great little set that had an extra knight with body armor and a ghost. I always thought of the knight as a prince that had sought out the Black Monarch's Ghost to get some advice from his father. Of Course he had been murdered by a member of the Black Falcons. REVENGE! I always had an active imagination. 

Pros:
Ghost
Knight

It's really simple, but You can spent hours playing with it. The ghost itself is a very rare and unusual persona here, and especially in Lego these days. A shining one - You can play with it or use for jokes with your friends.

This character is very useful: it suits nicely the Castle theme, and any other set You have. The ones that have Studios sets at their disposal can put this ghost to good use as well.

We may assume, that this tower is a modular element, that can be attached to larger structures if You want. The white block with the bird can be used as an extra detail for the horse.

If You have a chance - then buy this one as soon as possible. As far as I remember ghosts can be found only in several other sets, that are much larger and, thus, more expensive.

<p>Figures: The obvious attraction to this set is&nbsp;the glow in the dark ghost and improved-upon classic lego knight.&nbsp; The knight was impressive with his black and red outfit and painted on silver breast plate to be enhanced further by additional armour and a helmet with lifting visor.&nbsp; You can even see his cute lil lego eyes peering through the slots in said visor! The ghost was a neat addition but I remember being disappointed that he didn't have a face or moveable legs under his ghostly visage.</p>
<p>Parts:&nbsp; Again - very simple build, but you get some original archway doors, and 2 back wall pieces which to this day remain one of my favourite lego molds. (also used around that time quite frequently&nbsp;in the blacktron space ship builds) The castle makes use of the male/female attaching system used for castles&nbsp;during this&nbsp;time allowing for unlimited and variable expansions throughout your realm of lego kingdoms.</p>
<p>Accessories: Grey statuesque bird adds to the dreary setting. The white horse is a good contrast to the black knight and structure. 2 flags attached to jousting sticks, sword, and dragon shield (which was also new within this series) round out the rest of the set.</p>

"Ernst","2012-05-22T17:28:58.023Z","Guard the Ghost or haunt the Guard ?","<p>Overall 5 bricks : I really love these small sets Lego brought out in the older Castle themes. These sets were (and are) affordable and gave the chance to built a good army and offered also good pieces. This is a great example, you have a small tower, a Knight on a horse, a bird and a great figure : The Monarch's Ghost. If you like the Castle theme try and get it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks : Not too much building and easy, the small tower is mostly shaped by 2 wall parts and some small bricks. Even for a kid a 5 minute job, but I must add you get a nice result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 5 bricks : The set gives nice Castle parts you can use to make a bigger tower. The best parts are the Knight with horse, 2 banners, a bird and&nbsp;the part&nbsp;I like most is <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/minifigs/?m=gen002"">the Ghost</a>. In fact about all 46 parts are usefull so 5 bricks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 5 bricks : A kid can have a lot of fun with a set like this : Knight chases Ghost, Ghost haunts Knight and more I guess if you have the imagination of a kid.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks : <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=6034-1"">Bricklink</a> offers an average of some&nbsp;€10,00 which is a good price for a fun set like this.

<h4>Parts</h4>
<p>The parts selection in the set is great, especially for one so small. It includes a Glow in the Dark ghost, a set of small sized brown doors, a grey bird, and of course, the Black Knight himself. This was one of the first 4 or 5 sets to include a knight with this armor, so that makes it all the more special. </p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4>
<p>The Black Knight is a great figure, having both a printed chestplate on the torso and the actual armor pieces. The Ghost is also cool, although mine doesn't glow very well. I'm not sure if that applies to all sets, though. </p>
<h4>The build</h4>
<p>The build of the set is fairly quick and uninteresting, with nothing really unique, though there is nothing wrong with it either. As with all the Castle sets of this time, it includes the pin system to connect it to another castle set.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>Overall, the set has a great parts selection and great minfigures for such a small set. The build is somewhat uninteresting, but the set still has a good playability factor. It also has a good value for the money. If you can find the set, I highly recommend it. </p>",TRUE,4,5,3,4,5
"LordDunsany","2020-05-29T04:27:38.883Z","One of the better small castle sets","<p>This small set was a good source of many of the new Castle elements in the early 90s. The set comes with a knight on horseback with the new armor and moving visor helm elements and is armed with a lance, sword, and shield (a second lance is used as a flagpole on the building). Although this knight is not as fancy as the ones in 6009 and 6086, I actually prefer the older heater shields for my mounted knights to the newer kite shields (the smaller and lighter heater shields actually superseded kite shields historically as body armor improved as they were far more manageable).</p>

<p>The main structure appears to be either a guard shack (although the ceiling is a bit too low to allow a minifig wearing a helm to stand inside) or a small mausoleum/tomb (hence the ghost). The building actually contains connector elements for connecting it to some other castle sets of the time if one wished to incorporate this into a larger structure. The grey &quot;parrot&quot; is generally seen as a falcon and the white 1x2 brick and plate he/she is perched on can fill in the gap left on the horse if the saddle were removed. Interestingly, the saddle marks one the final appearances of the older style with only a single clip.</p>

<p>This set is definitely worth getting for the fully equipped knight (except for his hands - apparently none of the knights from earlier castle sets wore gauntlets until 6090) as an excellent heavy cavalry builder.</p>

<p>It&#39;s all about the ghost this set! And what a figure the ghost is - my two&nbsp;boys absolutely love it, they are delighted by the way that it still glows in the dark after all these years. I say ghosts, I have 4 across a number of sets&nbsp;but I should really have 5. However, I exchanged the ghost and knight from this set for all 6 of the forest men from set 6066 with a friend when I was a kid - looking back, that was an awesome swap!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The black knights were my favourite faction when growing up - but given that I got the Black Knights castle within a few months of this set, I always felt this knight looked a bit different -&nbsp;it&#39;s what I now think is the &quot;1990 version&quot; of the mounted black knight - ie in the new breast plate and visor helmet that the 1988 version&nbsp;lacked, but with the older style (non-dragon) plume and the smaller&nbsp;shield that only the infantry soldiers carried by the time of Black Knights castle. So for most of my childhood my knight was upgraded to a red dragon plume and a kite shaped shield to match the rest of the mounted black knights! This knight was more&nbsp;similar in appearance to the mounted Crusader knights that were also released in 1990, with just their shields&nbsp;giving away their allegiances.</p>

<p>The build isn&#39;t too bad, and the ability to connect this to other sections of wall were nice - I still have both of mine connected, one either side, of the Town Gate. The height match is ok, but not great, as others have mentioned. I always felt like this suggested there had been plans for many black walled sets, but that by the end of 92 Lego had decided to go a different route&nbsp;into dragons and wizards, leaving the black knights to be cut off like a lame duck, marking for me the end of the truly great era of classic castle.</p>

<p>First and foremost - a ghost. It consists of fluorescent shell, a black minifig head which helps to point&nbsp;out his&nbsp;mouth and eyes. Blank white minifig chest with white hands and 1X2 brick and a plate. You can place a ghost under a lamp for a few minutes and when you turn lights off it shall glow in sickly greenish light.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ghost&#39;s uniqueness shall devalue&nbsp;quickly as lego will&nbsp;from then onwards include it in too many sets - only black knights subtheme has&nbsp;two more&nbsp;ghosts after this one.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Second there&#39;s a new knight. Here you shall get a new knight with the plate armor piece. He wears it over printed armour on his chest. There&#39;s a new helmet as well with moveable visor, when&nbsp;visor is down the knight looks really menacing, however when the visor is up it reveals a standard lego smiley face. This knight was unique in Black Knights subtheme, in 1990 you could not get it in other sets no matter how expensive they were (there&#39;s one in Knight&#39;s stronghold, but he belongs to Black Falcons - they are a guest faction in that set).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The knight is armed with standard lance / flag but&nbsp;when he loses it he can draw a sword from a saddle clip as a last resort.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There&#39;s a grey hawk which is a nice addition to the already grim scene. It is a standard pirates parrot mould - just grey overall.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The structure is a windowless shack or a mini tower. A knight can stand on its top and observe its surroundings. Tower is decorated with a blue flag on another grey lance. This feature is not well thought&nbsp;because Lego designer included &nbsp;technic parts at the tower&#39;s base which should help with connecting it to other walled structures in lego knights realm. It is not possible to attach the tower to the right because flag and its clip holder would be an obstacle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is difficult to play with this set alone. A questing knight would definitely need some treasure to retrieve from this haunted place, but there are none.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are three alternate builds on the back of the box.&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. A coral for the dismounted horse and riding equipment: This build ignores the ghost and many other parts from this set, so I guess most of you shall skip it unless you own more than one 6034. If that is the case build that coral inside Black Monarch&#39;s Castle as a very good addition to its interior!</p>

<p>2. Some sort of &quot;maze&quot; with castle corners with doors placed as are viewed in mirror. Insanely the knight is pictured walking on foot and carrying the bird while the ghost is armed with lance and shield&nbsp;while&nbsp;riding the horse!!!</p>

<p>3. The best alternative: A Black arch or a portal decorated with a shield, a flag and a bird with ghost in the middle. Mounted knight is approaching it with a sword and a flag in his arms.&nbsp;</p>
