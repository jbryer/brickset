"PerryThePlatypus","2020-07-24T09:49:20.91Z","This is Berk... wait, wrong place","<p>For a series that&rsquo;s supposed to be a celebration of the 10 year anniversary of CMFs, series 20 was a huge disappointment to me, if anything, it felt more like a rushed filler series, series 19 was better! With only a quarter of minifigures of this series that actually interest me, I think the Viking is a true standout for this overall lackluster series, not only is it filled with great detailing, it also has great parts and a somewhat unique idea for a CMF.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The look of this Viking looks pretty different compared to the minifigures from the 2005 Vikings theme. His legs are very detailed with a dual molded design that has olive green on the top half of the legs and brown on the bottom half and even some printing on the side of the legs and it looks awesome. The torso is very detailed as well, continuing the olive green color and a belt strap printed on which was carried on to the hip and leg.&nbsp;&nbsp;He also has a necklace printed on the front torso and a blue cape design for the back printing which wasn&rsquo;t entirely needed, but I really appreciate the extra effort. The arms are a dual-molded design with the olive green and dark brown colors once again and they look very nice. A blue cape is included with the figure with the soft material which I like. The beard piece here is a new coloring in orange and they even included an extra of it which I was really happy about. The face print for the figure has a stern face with an orange beard and mustache, there&rsquo;s no alternate face, but it&rsquo;s fine. And then we have the Viking helmet piece which is a new mold that doesn&rsquo;t have horns on them, which make it stand out compared to previous Lego Viking helmets, the helmet itself has very nice molded detail to it and even has some gold printed on the front of the helmet where the eyes are, one last thing to note on the helmet is that it has an accessory hole at the top, so I&rsquo;ve tried putting different pieces on it, like a bow and a party hat. Finally, the Viking has 2 accessories, the first of which is a brown spear piece with the rubber top which was nice to get in a cheap CMF and a shield piece that has new printing to it with the white and blue design that look very cool.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this figure is probably the best one of series 20, it has what most figures of the series lack: a (somewhat) unique idea, great detailing, great parts and a pretty good value I&rsquo;d say. If you weren&rsquo;t a huge fan of series 20, I recommend at least getting this one, this figure is definitely worth the price.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Out upon the&nbsp;</strong>misty seas of the North Atlantic sails a lone ship that bobs and rolls over wave after wave, empty and silent... the sail is ruined and tattered and the yardarm is broken, and the serpent head at the bow is splintered, casting ominous shadows... there is only one life on that lonely longboat, one survivor of a terrible attack... and he awakes!</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The Viking is the 8th minifigure in series 21 and one of several historic minifigs in the series.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;He wears an olive green outfit made of leather and sturdy boots of elks hide with linen inside to keep his feet warm in the frosts of Norway.&nbsp;A&nbsp;long blue mantle drapes&nbsp;over a smaller cape that is secured tightly by a gold pin and around his shoulder is a leather strap that holds tight his clothes. A strong belt tightened by a silver buckle is strapped around his waist where he stores his belongings.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;But his most precious item is a silver necklace with an oval medallion that bears a queer symbol of great importance... but of what importance it holds, no one knows. But it is valued greatly by this solemn adventurer.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;His helm is of thick iron and will break at only the strongest blow, with&nbsp;golden eye guards that make this Vikings eyes hard to see, making him yet more mysterious. He rarely takes off his helm, but when he does a few say that his hair is as wild as fiery orange as his beard.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;And yes, his short, thick, and unkempt beard conceals his face yet more so that with helm and beard both, he is unrecognizeable to those who do know his true face. But beneath it all is a brave, bold, and slightly aged face that knows the world and has seen much in his life.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;His weapon&nbsp;of&nbsp;choice isn&#39;t a&nbsp;sword&nbsp;or axes, but a spear with a pole of thick spruce wood and an iron tip that has a cold bite when it stabs it&#39;s foes. In his left hand he carries a roundshield with colors of his choice, white and blue. Some say that they represent the raging&nbsp;sea with its deep blue waters and foaming white waves. The most notable thing about his shield is that, though it still provides protection, it is much lighter and smaller than most of the shields carried by his kin. There is rumor that he made it that way so he could throw it far through the air at distant enemies.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;So this is probably the best minifigure in the series, especially since we have very few viking themed Legos at all. Every part of the minifigure is a very useful part and could be used for many different things. The helmet even looks like a Rohan helmet from The Lord of the Rings! I really would appreciate it if lego would make a whole new line of viking sets again, considering the possibility they could do with a new Viking theme with all of their new pieces. I am really hopping that the lego ideas Viking Village project by BrickHammer is approved in the third review phase!</p>

<p>&nbsp; Also, Vikings are very unique historical figures and I would love it if one day (the new Colosseum set makes me more hopeful) lego would do a full Tfol and Afol centered History theme.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2022-02-11T16:19:03.67Z","For Fjord and Country!","<p><b>Set #71027 Viking:</b>&nbsp;This wonderful Minifigure is one where LEGO has gone all out, it has dual-molding for the arms and legs, printing on the torso and legs that depict a suitably rustic looking Norse inspired warrior. Unlike the short-lived Vikings Theme from LEGO this figure does not have the more traditionally used horned helmets, instead he wears a full-facial covering style of helmet complete with a hole in top for a plume. (Not included.)</p>

<p>Carrying his spear into battle with a printed round shield showing blue and white markings and including an orange beard and a blue cape which, if lost or misplaced, is also visible on the back of the torso print so you can customize with soft goods or not when you troop build this fellow for your army displays/MOCs.</p>

<p>Overall this Minifigure is loaded with charm and details that make for an excellent addition to the Minfigures based on Historical figures situation. I would Strongly Recommend this guy, he&#39;s one not to pass up if given the chance and multiples allow for parts to customize. If you were fortunate enough to collect any of the actual LEGO Vikings Theme these would go pretty well in any display to add common ground soldiers to the Long Ships. Strongly Recommended.</p>

"SmilingCyclops","2022-08-27T17:11:40.917Z","The Viking-est Viking minifigure","<p>Lego has made Viking CMFs before, there&#39;s a variety from the mid-2000s Vikings theme, and in 2022 they included several Vikings in the Creator 3-in-1 ship (31132). These Lego Vikings have always sported horned, or occasionally winged, helmets. Those helmets instantly tell you that they&#39;re meant to be Vikings, even though actual Vikings didn&#39;t wear helmets like that, at least not in battle. Of course, we neither expect nor demand historical accuracy from CMFs, but once in a while Lego comes through anyway: this figure&#39;s unique helmet piece not only lacks the horns, but it has the little spectacle-type armor that some preserved Viking helmets did have. Moreover, this Viking wields a spear, rather than a stereotypical axe or sword. Given the cost and weight of metal, actual seafaring raiders generally preferred spears. These details make this hands-down the most Viking-like Viking minifig that Lego has ever produced. They also make it the Lego Viking minifig that I like best.</p>
