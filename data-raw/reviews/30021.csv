<p>There are only two pieces excluding the minifigure. The first of which is the stand which is the basic black 3x4 plate, the same as all basic CMF series. The minifigure also comes with an energy sword. The piece by itself looks amazing, but it doesn&#39;t seem to look quite right sitting in his hand. It could have benefited by including a handle, so it looks more like a sword.</p>

<p>Minifigure:</p>

<p>The overall minifigure looks spectacular. The helmet looks great and the gold and black design really stands out against the red. The &ldquo;v&rdquo; shape on the helmet looks good and fits with the rest of the design. The design on the head fits the minifigure but looks rather bland by itself. It could have benefited from a dual-sided head featuring another more exciting expression on the other side. The torso had extraordinary&nbsp;detail which continues onto the back. The arms both feature printing as well completing a magnificent design. The legs are completely printed as well. The white on the feet goes along well with the white belt and the overall design, and printing from the torso that continues down to the legs is always appreciated.</p>

<p>Playability:</p>

<p>Potential future colors of this minifigure would enhance the playability and create a full &ldquo;Not Power Ranger&rdquo; squad. But the minifigure by itself still shows great playability.</p>

<p>Value for Money:</p>

<p>The original price for this minifigure was $4.99 which is a bit steep seeing as it only has five pieces and a stand. Though seeing as that is the standard price for any CMF now, this figure couldn&#39;t be an exception.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>This is a highly&nbsp;exceptional CMF from series 20&nbsp;and a great way to make a Power Ranger without getting any licenses. Although the sword could be improved with a handle, I would highly recommend this minifigure overall.</p>

There are side arm printing for patches on the costume and the printing all over the torso just looks right.</p>

<p>The head underneath is a simple print with a familiar look, I don&#39;t want to say it, but I think this one might be a little too similar to some of the Ninjago facial expressions. The blade he comes with is also originally from Ninjago.</p>

<p>Overall I wouldn&#39;t mind seeing LEGO make similar releases in different colours to make an actual team with all the colours of the rainbow, practically I suspect that this will be difficult due to rights and likenesses and such. That being said, I do like seeing an army of these little guys in my collection, they make perfect Cosplayers for City displays. Recommended.</p>
