Definitely designed after the famous Karate Kid film in the fact that he his sporting a white training gi with black belt, breast pocket marking and a band around the forehead printed on both sides for each expression, this Minifigure is another great stand out from the line.</p>

<p>He includes a unique new accessory, a nunchaku with actual chain that cam be swung about when simulating play, this is much different from the previous TMNT era sets where two parts were attached with a short length of chain, this is a fully sculpted and moulded accessory which is all a single piece. His two expressions include happy beaming smile and gritting determined battle training. I believe his hair piece is also a brand new sculpt.</p>

<p>Overall a decent offering and well worth tracking down if you missed out on him. Sad to say he was the second hardest one to find with the random purchasing 2020 forced on many of us. Highly Recommended.</p>
