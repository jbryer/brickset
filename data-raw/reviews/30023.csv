This little gem of a character includes a white spear for a javelin, a printed disk to represent the Discus and some great parts. She includes dual-molded legs with printing on the sides of her feet for shoe markings, possible a Nike equivalent in the LEGO universe. Octan Sneakers maybe?</p>

<p>Her torso includes 0937 on the back and front representing her number in the event, she also has two gold medals, a smiling expression after winning and a determined sweaty expression of exertion as she participates in her events.</p>

<p>Overall she&#39;s great, but her name could have used some work. Track &amp; Field Star might have been a better idea than simply the generic term Athlete. Highly Recommended.</p>
