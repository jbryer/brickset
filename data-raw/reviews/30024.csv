"Odeinoichus","2022-02-25T13:57:23.183Z","Almost Perfect.","<p><b>Set #71027 Sea Rescuer:</b>&nbsp;This brilliant looking Minifigure from the CMF Series 20 line includes some excellent parts and print, she comes in a standard wet suit design complete with dual-molded arms and legs for that proper Wet Suit look, her chest design is that of a Sea Turtle which matches one of her best accessories.</p>

<p>She includes a pair of fins, two sets of hover pieces designed to simulate flight and introduced with the LEGO DC Theme, here they are meant to represent when she is under the water and floating along to help with the Sea Turtle she comes with. She also has two plant pieces, the tops of Carrots to feed the Turtle with.</p>

<p>The Turtle is a great addition to the LEGO Animals collection, it is designed with its front legs out and wide to simulate swimming while it&#39;s back legs are more tucked in, the head is sticking out and it has a very smooth shell with proper design elements included in the sculpt. Overall a brilliant new Animal to add to your LEGO collection.</p>

<p>As you can see I got quite a number of these and am quite impressed with them, there is however one flaw. A glaring omission really, perhaps they couldn&#39;t include it because of all the parts she already comes with, but it would have been supremely nice to find an extra head piece with this set so you could switch out her diving helmet for a proper set of hair. Be it straight, ponytail or what, if the Intergalactic Girl from long ago taught me anything it&#39;s very nice to have the option of a separate hair piece for alternate display options. I Highly Recommend this CMF character, but do wish I didn&#39;t have to spend extra at LEGO P&amp;B to get some hairstyles to give my little army for when she isn&#39;t diving into the sea to rescue turtles and other creatures from environmental hazards. Highly Recommended.</p>
