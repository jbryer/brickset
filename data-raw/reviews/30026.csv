<p>The hair peice returns from the old Luke Skywalker figure from Ach-To, and looks wonderful as well as capturing a very nice look. Very nice peice!&nbsp;</p>

<p>The face is nice as well, displaying the figure with an open mouthed smile and a singing expression. I imagine that it will be useful for other minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The body is amazing, with a black jean jacket&nbsp;&nbsp;and a pink lightning bolt down the centre. The back is even more impressive, with a logo that says &quot;TOUR&quot; as well as a city skyline. Overall, the body is probably the most impressive peice.</p>

<p>His pants are a&nbsp;<em>little&nbsp;</em>bland, they are just pink pants with a small belt buckle pattern on the hip. At first look it would appear that he had plain pants.&nbsp;</p>

<p>His accessory is outstanding as well, though with a major flaw: the black keys are on the wrong way. Other than that, amazing,&nbsp; it doesn&#39;t really bother me cause the minifigure is fantastic, though it seems a big fumble for Lego.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this minifigure&nbsp;is amazing, and my favorite from series 20, it has many new prints and a new piece. Final Verdict: don&#39;t miss out on this guy!&nbsp;</p>

With a suitably amusing dual-sided face, one side singing his heart out while rocking, the other smiling with the rockin&#39; good looks and the fancy red keytar accessory this Minifigure has stepped right out of the past.</p>

<p>LEGO has done a disservice with this figure, now we need 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s and 90s musicians to join him up on stage for an awesome revival concert. Overall it&#39;s a solid offering with some great elements and any fans of this genre/era of music should definitely pick him up. Recommended.</p>
