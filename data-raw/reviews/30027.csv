"Sideswipe2","2020-11-10T04:35:03.187Z","One of my least favorite in this series","<p>Am always interested in picking up new Minifigures for my collections, however this one was a bit of a disappointment.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t say the Minifigure isn&#39;t well done, in parts at least. To start on the bright sides of it, the torso has both back printing and arm printing, which is always a plus in my opinion. The Wig mold in the Cool Yellow/Bright Light Yellow is nice as from what research has shown it has only been in Reddish Brown before and I really am always looking for the Wigs in a different color. The same can be said about the mini (child) legs, though when taken with this figure, I feel it could have benefited from printing matching the torso, especially for the price paid for these figures. Finally, the head... I understand it is a unique print for this character currently, but with what you pay, I feel that it should have at least had a dual expression, either sleeping or crying (like they don&#39;t want to go to bed), it just seemed bland to me, especially with some of the other CMFs out there.</p>

<p>On the &quot;build&quot;, it&#39;s a CMF so there&#39;s not much more to say. It comes with the standard 3x4 tile/plate with the four studs, as all the CMFs seem to. The accessory is possibly the best part, as the bunny is very well done in both color and printing (It seemed to be unique, but apparently has recently been released in the Seseme Street set as well, so if you are looking for a way to get that piece, this is a cheaper set/series to get it in).</p>

<p>Playability-wise, it&#39;s a Minifigure, so I would normally say it would be a good addition to any set, but with the theme of it, and the fact that it doesn&#39;t even include a sleeping face, not sure how much playability you could get out of it. Am an adult collector though, so maybe kids could think of something...</p>

<p>Overall, was accepting of getting the first one (I buy them in packs 2-4 at a time) as I hadn&#39;t got one yet, and liked the hair piece and bunny to add. However, I will admit I was disappointed when I got the 2nd one as even with the 1st I really didn&#39;t feel it was worth the price of the pack. I&#39;ll still see what I can do with the parts at least...</p>

<p>She also includes a nice new blonde hair piece, a friendly smiling facial print, short pink legs and a cute top with rabbit head prints on her PJs. Overall she&#39;s pretty adorable, not a bit stand out from the line, but definitely one of the top seven or so. Recommended.</p>
