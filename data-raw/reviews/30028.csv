<p>Drone Boy is a standard looking Minifigure, he includes simple torso printing with a sweater over a classic shirt, this one with a T logo, I am not certain if this is a Logo from any existing LEGO Theme or something unique to the character, all I do know is that look is serviceable for any number of similarly dressed characters in MOC LEGO City displays. The legs have no printing, the face has printing showing a bandage on one cheek and he&#39;s sticking his tongue out, perhaps in deep thought.</p>

<p>The real interest of this character is the uniquely printed tile featuring a control device with built-in video display for controlling the buildable Drone, this uses the half rainbow tile that we&#39;ve seen before, the drone uses existing parts with a brand new top piece designed to hold four brand-new little&nbsp;propeller elements. Overall this is a fairly impressive package with tons of potential enjoyment for collecting multiples to build a nice Drone supporting activity club. Highly Recommended.</p>
