<p>This is the 20th non-licenced Lego Minifigures Series. It comes&nbsp;with 16 New Minifigures and retails for 5$ each.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigs:</p>

<p>So I&nbsp;will rate all the minifigs. Lets Start with the 5/5 minifigures, and surprisingly there is Not a Single 5/5 minifig. But there are 5&nbsp;4/4 minifigs. The first one is the Viking, that one has a really cool overall look. The shield is very cool, so is the spear. The second one is the PowerRanger. Its a pretty cool idea and a very nice minifig. And the last 4/4 minfig is the pinata boy. The pinata is really cool and i think the colours match really good. The next one is the Knight. A love the colours and the accessorys. Altought we didnt really need another Knight. And the last one is the Hip-Hop Girl. I like the turqoise Ghetto-Blaster and the overall Look.</p>

<p>Then there are 5&nbsp;3/5&nbsp;minifigs. The first&nbsp;one beeing the Karate guy. I really like the accesory. The hair piece is really cool too. Then there is the 80s keyguitar guy. I like the accesory, the rest is okay. Also the Girl with the bunny. It is a childish Version of the Series 6 Minfigure, But just a bad&nbsp;version of it. The rabbit is cool the Rest just to simple. The there is the BeanSuitGirl, another costume....I like it because of the look, But did we really need a BeanCostume? It just feels like an odd Choice. Also the accessory sucks(a red Apple..white)The last one is the Lama. A okay Choice and an okay minifigure, Not much to say about it.</p>

<p>Then there are the 2/5&nbsp;Minifigs. Here we got 4 Minifigs. The First one is the Drone guy. Drones.... again. The Minifigs is terrible, the accesorys, like with a lot of Minifigs, are okay, But no special. The diver sucks, But the turtle Rocks. The Disc and Speer thrower is okay. The Overall is good But there is really nothing Special. The NASA ingeniuer is okay. The accessorys and the Minifigs are okay, But Not Special.</p>

<p>The 1/5 Minifigs:</p>

<p>Pirate Girl. The accesory sucks, the Look fits to the barracuda-bay. Again the 3rd pirate, the First women. Really nothing Special. Only bought it to complete the Series.</p>

<p>The BrickSuitGuy.</p>

<p>Dont understand me wrong, the figure is cool, But overused. We had a couple of BrickSuits in Series 18, then there is the random green one. The BrickSuits didnt sell to good and now put in another one. But the worst, this is the 20th Series Anniversary Minifigure. The accesory is a 20 Plate......</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t understand it. Maybe if it would be only once in box&rsquo;s, could make it better but this. A huge dissapointment.</p>

<p>Last But Not least the price:</p>

<p>5$.........no. Buy it&rsquo;s with price of, But never for retail price. The worst series, and the highest price.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>Really nothing special, and an overpriced Series.</p>
