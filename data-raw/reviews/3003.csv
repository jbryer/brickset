"Novelty","2007-04-07T08:21:17.037Z","Tent Cities","This is an interesting pavillion with a knight.  There is nothing special about the design with one exception - there are no wall sections on this set.  That may be a good or a bad thing.  However despite the absense of a wall, there is a peg built into the set for connecting it to the other castle wall sections.  The other part of the set, the knight is almost all black from head to foot in an attempt to recreate the &quot;black knight&quot;.  This contrasts strongly with the red and white pavillion and gives the set a disjointed look as if they are two set thrown together at random.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"jman","2007-09-02T19:32:49.91Z","Timeless Small Lego Set","Recently came across this set from my childhood while packing our house. What a fantastic Lego set that I remember playing with for hours.

Pros
2 Minifigs with different midevil outfits
Lots of Weapons (sword, axe, shield, joust pole, 2 spears
Horse
Guard House Roof Opens for easy access
It was probably very affordable

Even though this is a small set it had enough included to play with on it's own and even better with other castle sets.

You could position the guard house along the road to the castle or at a important spot in the woods (maybe by the stables).....ahh the memories, Great Set Then and Now.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-12-08T11:13:03.107Z","A tournament tent","In German the name of this set was &quot;Turnierwache&quot;, which means as much as tournament guard. So for me this was one of those tents that could be found near the tournament area where two knights with their lances and horses were rushing towards each other. The red roof supports this idea. It resembles the roof of a tent more than anything else. 

However, the set itself is great. And I don't think you get the black feather on the knight's helmet in many other sets. This set included, peeron.com only lists five sets where you can get that black feather. 

Of course, you can use this set to guard the drawbridge of your castle. The guard has an axe and two spears within grasp, but he comes without a shield. Only the black knight has a shield; a black falcon shield with a yellow border pattern.

"Gus_263","2008-04-08T15:28:23.233Z","Guardians","This set is from the black falcons theme, have useful pieces and the building isn't a castle, is a small fort. Altough it, this fort can makes part of castles if you have one, because the pieces are compatible. The set also have additions to the castle theme, like the horse, knights and also it's itens. The white pieces are well made in the correct shape to make a fort with a gate. A knight, that are in the horse have useful armors for one, have a black helmet, design of armor in the body, and he can put the sword in the horse also. The building is white, don't combines with the black and blue of the two knights, but it isn't a problem. A red part is included, an useful one later included in ufo sets as a transluscent green piece. Flags are also included, being in the two spears on the sides of the gate, or in the spear of the joust that the armored knight hangs. The minifigures are different but have characteristics that looks like, it is cool if you are searching for make an army with different types of knights. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>There's a fair amount of accessories with this for playability and a flag that I always placed on top of the Guard Post.</p>

"knightofgold","2011-02-11T21:51:46.33Z","And so it started!","<p>This was the first Lego castle set I acquired. And the beginning of my lifelong love for Lego castle. Luckily the 80's were a good time for Lego.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>It's a little hard to comment on the these since mine have been missing for over two decades. Thankfully for the internet I was able to reconstruct this set. Pretty much all Lego sets from this time period had the same basic layout with pictures of the completed set on the cover and alternate builds on the back. Lego did not believe in fancy artwork back than.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>The set consists of mainly white bricks, a few red pieces, small green base, and an uncommon red canvas top piece. Very useful pieces. Nothing overly specialized.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>One guy in Black Falcon heraldry and a mounted black knight. This was a good set for minifigures and accessories. You got 2 spears, an axe, sword, and black lance. The Black Falcon guy made a nice man-at-arms for the black knight. I loved the black knight; black horse, black lance, black helmet, black feather. He made a good villain. He was my main bad guy for a long time.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's a small set and doesn't take long at all to build. A good beginner set.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The name of the set is Castle Guard, but I always thought it looked more like a tournament tent. Especially with the pennant on top. The white and red makes it a very colorful set, which set it apart from most castle sets back then.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I give this set a really high rating for value for money because I wanna say this cost me about 5 Marks. So when I got this it was a good deal at the time. If you are trying to buy this set now, I think it goes for over $10 these days, it may not be such a good deal. A must have if you love the classic castle sets, or want to enter the black knight into the tournament in the Knights Challenge set. So all nostalgia aside this is a good small set with classic minifigs and a nice addition to castle.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"oscholes","2011-09-25T12:25:03.22Z","Great castle addition","<p>Very simple set, easy to build - with the bonus of a fairly uncommon red canvassy-type piece. Two minifigures, and plenty of accessories - enough to play with on its own, but even more wonderful as a small addition to a Castle collection. Younger builders (like I was when I first acquired it) will love the simple build and play potential, but I think older builders will find it still has quite a bit of charm. Highly recommended for those filling out their medieval universe!<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"Ernst","2012-02-15T17:35:38.447Z","Great set with one flaw, if you have it you want another one.","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong> : A very good set, complete and has great parts. You can use it single or with any other set you own. The only bad side ?? If you have one set&nbsp;you want another because Guards always are at least with 2 persons on guard.</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks</strong> : a small set with just the small Guard shelter to built but a very good piece it is. Rear wall made out of red bricks and several white slopes for the side walls. Definitly the best and easiest part is the red roof on the red hinge, works great !</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong> : The Guard and Knight with horse are known figures but very good with sufficient weapons. The shelter parts are nice and the best part of course the big red roof.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong> : the set can be used as Guard with the Knight as enemy but it is on its best combined with other sets. With 2 of these sets you can make a Joust, you can place it in front of several Castle&#39;s and so on, very good.</p>

<p><strong>Value 4 bricks</strong> : Already 25 years old so it gets more value, <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=6035-1"">Bricklink</a> offers an average of &euro;12,50 which I think is a good price for this set.</p>

"rab1234","2018-09-20T16:30:52.013Z","What you see is what you get","<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>This is a tiny build and comes together extremely fast.&nbsp; There&#39;s really nothing interesting about it even by mid 80s standards.</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>The red roof is at least an interesting piece, but I&#39;m not sure about the overall color scheme.&nbsp; It does match with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/1584-1/Knight-s-Challenge""><span>1584: </span> Knight&#39;s Challenge</a> but those 2 sets are, I believe, unique and feel a bit out of place with the rest of the 80s and early 90s castle sets.&nbsp; There are good parts included such as the horse and quantity and variety of weapons.&nbsp; I was also a big fan of the all black knights as they made for good bad guys.</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>Decent playability for a small set with a horse and 2 soldiers.&nbsp; Of course when combined with other sets, the playability is much higher, but even on its own, an ok little set.</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>This was an inexpensive little set back in the day and to get 2 cool figures and a bunch of weapons, I believe it had good value even if the structure was a bit weak.</p>

<h2><strong>Overall</strong></h2>

<p>Most of the other small sets of the era felt a bit more worth the money as they generally either had more figures or more play features. I would put almost all of the carts, catapults, and shops ahead of this one, so I give it a 3/5 overall when looked at against its peers.</p>

"Hitokiri_2000","2023-04-04T14:50:44.667Z","One is never enough","<p>This will not really be your typical review. I hope you enjoy it anyway.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well like the review title says, one is never enough.</p>

<p>I have 3 or 4 of this set, I can&#39;t even recall at this exact moment&nbsp;and I will buy more as I come across them at decent prices.</p>

<p>You can never really get too many of this set, especially if you want to make a cool set up with the Black Falcon castles 6073 and or 6074 along with the wall sets 6061 and the 6062. So the more of those you combine to make a large ring wall around say a village then the more this set will come in handy especially in pairs outside every gate in the wall.</p>

<p>Plus the colour scheme does not really hinder its use with the other factions from the castle universe like the Lion Knights. Just swap out the Black Falcon sentry with a Lion Knight sentry and your in business.</p>

<p>I always felt that the Lion Knights got the bigger piece of the pie in terms of larger sets so the more sets of the Black Falcons 6073 and 6074 you have the more impressive your town layout will be.</p>

<p>So I must admit I really like this relative small set because if used right and the more you have of them the more useful they become.</p>

"mediAFOL","2022-02-05T02:02:46.37Z","Classic Castle is dead","<p>After the joy of the brick-heavy Classic Castle sets with&nbsp;their optimistic packaging and colourful designs come the Eighties version. Far inferior in every way, sets like these represented the start of a thirty-five year Dark Ages for me.</p>

<p><img alt=""Castle Guard"" src=""https://tom.chadw.in/assets/pics/Lego/castleGuard.jpg"" style=""width: 826px; height: 846px;"" /></p>

<p>There is nothing to a set like this, other than the final model itself, which perhaps enhances a tournament scene. Beyond that, the cartoonish horse and juniorized roof piece couple with the bizarre subtheme box colours - gone the greenery of mediaeval Europe, here the blasted plains of Mordor - to create a meekly joyless set.</p>

<p>With the possible exception of the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/57622"">Guarded Inn</a>, this Castle iteration has never really been for me. Sadly.</p>
