The Llama costume Girl has a standard looking torso design with limited printing for a furry belly and a zipper on the back to &#39;take off&#39; the costume when she changes outfits. Her feet are printed on the toes for the hooves and she brings a fancy carrot to nibble on.</p>

<p>The headpiece is completely brand new with excellent sculpting to represent the creature form, her facial print includes open-toothed smile with wide grin and closed-mouth smile showing off the red lipstick she&#39;s wearing.</p>

<p>Ultimately this is an excellent addition to the numerous costume clade Minifigures in mascot designs. She has a suitable look to her and the head piece is great, overall I&#39;d recommend getting one or two. Recommended.</p>
