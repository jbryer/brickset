<p>When the original Ideas submission for this set got approved, Lego Pirates fans rejoiced. Pirates was back! Looking at the released product, it&#39;s quite different from the original submission, but I actually think it&#39;s an improvement.</p>

<p>Pirates fans have been begging for new sets for some time now. There is something about this theme that is pure magic. From the beautiful colors, to the wonderful characters and huge ships, Pirates has a lot to offer.</p>

<h2>Shipwreck Island:</h2>

<p>You start of by building part of the island where the ship got stranded. The first bags you open have a wonderful mix of colors, from the azure blue plates (water) to the green palm leaves and the tan used for the sand... This looks like a true tropical island. Various parts of the ship are spread out over sand banks, surrounded by improvised docks and palm trees. It looks surprisingly natural. There are all kinds of details all around as well such as boxes of fruit and barrels with all kinds of tools. The island part of the set is really well-built and sturdy too. It won&#39;t fall appart if you move it around.</p>

<h2>The Ship:</h2>

<p>While the original Ideas submissions focused mostly on the bay / harbor, this set is more focused on the ship. Personally, I&#39;m really happy with this decision because you can actually build a completed ship with this set. And it&#39;s been a while since we had a proper ship as well. The Silent Mary was only half a ship!</p>

<p>In the good old days, there were quite a few &quot;shipwreck island&quot; types of sets. These were nice, but I always thought it was a shame there weren&#39;t enough parts to build an completed ship. Maybe you got one mast and a bow, but if you wanted to build a ship, you had to buy another set. Not so with this set.</p>

<p>Once you resurrect the Barracuda she&#39;s more beautiful than ever. The designer captured the style of the original perfectly here, but managed to update it with new building techniques and added interior details. It&#39;s almost a perfect ship, even holding up well next to the great Imperial Flagship. If I had to give one point of critique it would be the front of the ship: it&#39;s a little too rectangular in my opinion. But overall the ship is just beautifully shaped and detailed. When you look back at the original 1989 set, it&#39;s actually a bit crude in some places. This one certainly feels a lot more polished. There are some parts where it was obvious the designer had to replace some classic ship pieces, because they are no longer being made such as the large mast piece. Here it&#39;s replaced by a really long Technic axle and a whole stack of round 2x2 bricks. Kind of strange, but it works.</p>

<p>I can&#39;t overstate how nice it is to have all those details inside the ship. This makes the ship feel so much more real even though you can&#39;t see the details from the outside. I&#39;m happy that there are no stickers in this set. I don&#39;t think Pirates have ever had stickers and I&#39;m glad they kept it that way. We also get a proper flag, unlike the weird one in Imperial Flagship.</p>

<h2>The Minifigures:</h2>

<p>Some figures such as captain redbeard and the lady are an hommage to the characters from the original set, while others such as the guy with the tattoos and the mustache brothers are new. These all look fantastic and I&#39;m happy that this aspect of Pirates (i.e. great characters) was not overlooked.</p>

<h2>Verdict:</h2>

<p>This is a fantastic set and well worth the price. As a play set, this set would provide hours of fun or it would look great on display as well.</p>

<p>I feel like Lego tried to put as much of the Pirates best features in this set, so I&#39;m not sure if we are going to see more Pirates sets or ships any time soon. I hope we do of course, but just make sure you don&#39;t miss out on this one if they don&#39;t!</p>

<p>Pirates is Lego at it&#39;s best. Let&#39;s hope we get a nice Castle set next!</p>

"Matt_Z_","2020-04-26T21:34:57.4Z","A Must-Have for Any Fan of LEGO","<p>Introduction<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>In April 2020, LEGO released the highly anticipated 21322 Pirates of Barracuda Bay.&nbsp; Courtesy the&nbsp;LEGO Ideas platform, this&nbsp;AFOL designed set&nbsp;received a lot of initial&nbsp;buzz and hype upon approval, buoyed in part by a revitalized interest in classic LEGO themes in the online LEGO community. After just completing the build within the last 48 hours, I will attempt to convey why I believe this to be one of the best LEGO sets ever released,&nbsp;at least in recent memory. It captures the spirit of what a LEGO set is meant to be and I hope I can elaborate on that below.&nbsp;I will use Brickset&#39;s rating categories to break down this review and keep it focused, and finish off with my final thoughts in conclusion.<br />
<br />
Building Experience- 5/5<br />
<br />
From cracking the spine on the singular instruction booklet, I knew this set was going to live up to the hype. As&nbsp;has become the norm with&nbsp;many Ideas sets, the initial pages presented a background on the original set creator, and the official LEGO set designers who worked on this set. What I instantly enjoyed was the passion and motivation behind the design team and the creator, and as a fan of classic LEGO themes myself, I could easily connect with this passion. The initial pages also gave a background on Captain Redbeard and the other pirates, by providing a storyline to accompany the set, and allow your imagination to grow. This was refreshing to read as I believe it paid homage to the theme and the legacy of Pirates, while allowing a completely new story to begin within this set. A worthy Ideas selection on so many levels and I think these&nbsp;introduction pages really set the stage for the build to come.<br />
<br />
The set is divided into 15 bags (some #&#39;s have multiple smaller bags)&nbsp;with additional packaging for larger parts that you use throughout the build. The build is absent stickers, a refreshing decision that I think LEGO would do well to continue where possible, especially within the Ideas range. Meticulous attention to detail was present throughout the build as we&#39;ve come to expect from an Ideas set. The build was varied throughout, and no two sections were the same. I never found myself bored or remotely disinterested- rather, I was engaged throughout the build, excited to see how this set was going to come together.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you are a fan or student of classic LEGO, several elements will bring a smile to your face as you progress. From references to the Islanders sub-theme, a printed flag&nbsp;mimicking 6067 Guarded Inn, familiar pirate accessories, and of course, the classic&nbsp;colours and shapes of the widely revered 6285 Black Seas Barracuda. To that point, the concept of effectively building two models in one was simply astonishing. As the build progresses, it becomes apparent that you are building the infamous Barracuda in stages throughout. When the build is complete, Bag 15 is actually not used in the island portion (along with 3 sails which remain unused). Instead, upon completion, the remaining pages of the instruction booklet demonstrate how to convert the island into the Barracuda. To me personally, this is the first time I have ever seen this in a LEGO set, and I&nbsp;was amazed at how&nbsp;brilliant and seamless this design was.To say this adds incredible value and another dimension to the set is an understatement. More on that later.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Interior of the build is just as detailed as we&#39;ve come to expect both from LEGO ships and Ideas sets. As mentioned, you are effectively building the interior of the Barracuda, but also areas for the crew to live on the island.&nbsp;This&nbsp;includes essential stations for the pirates to survive, whether on the open seas or on their shipwrecked island, but I&#39;ll leave those to the builder to discover. On the flip side, the exterior is fantastic, paying homage to the Barracuda, but also displaying overgrown foliage, trees, animals, marine life, and more. This gives a poignant sense that the shipwreck occurred in the distant past. There are little hidden compartments and other easter eggs/references that the builder will discover for themselves. It was here that I&nbsp;really appreciated the blend of extraordinary colour that this set displays- a classic mix of reddish-browns and greens, but also yellow and black, just to name a few. I often forgot I was building a ship and I think that added to the surprise and delight upon completing the model.&nbsp;Overall, this is a massive set, and took me by surprise as I didn&#39;t predict the finished model would be as big as it is. Truly, I cannot think of an equivalent building experience that really compares to this set.&nbsp;I hope that everyone can experience this build at some point.<br />
<br />
Parts/Accessories- 5/5<br />
<br />
As touched upon, the parts and accessories in this set are fabulous. From the minifigs themselves (complete with mini-bio&#39;s/backstories), to swords/guns, food elements (a great number of these), cannons, animals, foliage, flags, and more, this set does not pull any punches. This adds to the playability&nbsp;of the set and brings considerable life to the model. It doesn&#39;t make sense to nitpick small gripes (ie. no monkey, red parrot,&nbsp;&quot;ship in bottle&quot; accessories) because as the set designer mentions, a lot of these elements have been out of production for years. It also allows new takes on classic designs, such as the revamped Pirate flag, to take centre stage and allow a new generation to adopt Pirates.</p>

<p>Playability- 5/5<br />
<br />
If I could give a higher score, I would. This is truly the heart of this set and the essence of a fantastic LEGO model. As amazing as it is on display, both as the Barracuda or the island, there is no doubt that this set is meant to be played with. Cannons fire, doors open, ropes swing, and interiors and exteriors are expertly designed. But the main reason this is a 5/5 is the fact you can convert this set into the Black Seas Barracuda. Just think of the many playable scenarios where you reenact the ship wreck alluded to in the introduction section of the instructions, then spend time on the island, only to rebuild the ship and hit the seas once more. If you could only purchase one set for playability in 2020 and beyond, this is the one. I personally do not believe a set in the past decade or longer can lay claim to the precise imagination level&nbsp;sparked by this set.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Value for Money- 5/5<br />
<br />
This is typically where sets lose points in reviews, but in this case, I truly believe the value for money is a 5/5. Objectively, the PPP ratio is strong regardless of your currency. But subjectively, when you consider the fact that you&#39;re getting two models in one, simply by adding/removing some parts, this represents tremendous value. It reminds me of the&nbsp;90&#39;s Castle sets where they would demonstrate how to build additional models (but not include instructions, so they were almost impossible!). Yet in this case, you are given additional parts and instructions on how to make that a reality. The fact that the island portion can remain while you set sail in the Barracuda was a delightful result, and one of the most awesome surprises and rewards of this purchase. This was an eye-opener to me, especially in an increasing corporate climate; but in this case, it appears that consumer value seems to be placed visibly at the forefront of the final&nbsp;product.<br />
<br />
Overall Rating &amp; Conclusion- 5/5<br />
<br />
Not only has this set lived up to the hype, it has surpassed it. I am not above giving out a perfect score, and this set deserves it. The 2-in-1 model is incomparable to its immediate peers, when accounting for the themes&#39; expert level design and detail. The build scores perfect across all metrics including building experience, parts &amp; accessories, design, playability, and value for money. More importantly though, and what I consider to be the set&#39;s X-factor, is the imagination and play value that this set ignites- two pillars of TLG and the essence of a great set. Furthermore, it pays homage to a classic LEGO theme and storyline, allowing an older generation to relive their childhood, or a newer generation to be welcomed on board this&nbsp;Pirates adventure.</p>

<p>If you are able to purchase this set, or if you are on the fence at all, make the purchase- you will not regret it. What you might regret is missing this opportunity, then having the set retire, and being forced to pay a premium on the after market.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Many thanks to the creator and the LEGO design team for putting together this perfect final product.<br />

"LordDunsany","2020-05-07T00:49:55.997Z","Excellent 2-in-1 set","<p>Several lengthy reviews have already gone over many of the great things about this set including the connections with the past Pirates theme.&nbsp; Although the original Ideas submission looked good, I did not initially have a desire to purchase a large shipwreck/tavern. This set became a must-have, however, when I found out that the set had been redesigned such that one could also construct an entire ship that is essentially an updated #6285 utilizing new pieces and building techniques. This (official) ability to reconstruct beloved past iconic set models in newer sets is definitely something I wish LEGO did more. This review will mostly focus on the ship model component and not the primary build.</p>

<p>I do not have any particular nostalgia for the original #6285 set as it was before my time (the first pirate ship I have vague memories of seeing in catalogues was #6286). Nevertheless, I jumped at the chance to purchase the #10040 re-release, and I am pleased to say this update compares quite favorably with the (re-released) original.</p>

<p>Some people have complained about the rather bright primary color scheme of the ship, especially since it contrasts greatly with the original Ideas submission which used a more muted color scheme that is often claimed to be more &quot;realistic&quot;. Disregarding any personal aesthetic preferences (and the fact that the color scheme is meant to reproduce that of the original #6285 set), I think these claims of lessened realism are unfounded as many sailing ships from the period were brightly painted in primary colors (paintings of the HMS Victory often show a vibrant yellow, red, and black color scheme very similar to #6285). One also has to remember that pirate ships were often captured/repurposed vessels, which many pirate crews kept in good condition as they often could not simply sail to a nearby repair facility. The color scheme also allows for one to easily convert this ship into a warship or an armed merchant vessel by simply replacing the 3 Jolly Roger flags.</p>

<p>The new ship fixed one of the few issues I had with #6285/#10040: the lack of a fore-aft spanker sail (though the booms were present).&nbsp; The Barracuda is now (mostly) properly rigged as a brig, and I appreciate that this small but crucial (to me at least) change was made.&nbsp; The new building techniques incorporated also give the hull a more realistic curve than previous pirate vessels.&nbsp; The ship now also incorporates cleverly constructed ladders along the sides, a working anchor capstan, and a fully covered deck giving plentiful deck space that was sorely lacking in most previous LEGO pirate ships.</p>

<p>The new ship also has a detailed interior and 4 gunports on either side of the ship, giving it a potential broadside comparable to #6286 and #10210. These characteristics, however, lead to my main problem with the model: the ship is not built to accommodate guns without significant interior redesign. While some gunports can be made accessible by simply removing the window panes and clearing out furniture (which apparently has some basis in reality), cannon access to other gunports are partially blocked by interior wall/partitions that also serve structural purposes so some fundamental reconstruction is necessary to have a full broadside. Likewise, I wish 4 cannons had been included instead of only 3 to allow fully arming at least one side of the vessel.</p>

<p>Other minor issues are the somewhat boxy front of the forecastle and the back wall of the stern being too high such that a minifig standing on the poop deck will have trouble looking over it unassisted to see behind. This back wall also looks very plain on the inside and could use viewports or other interior decoration to break up the smooth yellow monotony. The sails also are only printed on one side, meaning that the jib and spanker sails only look good when viewing the starboard side of the ship. I also would have liked the inclusion of a proper crow&#39;s nest (though this was absent in #6285, it was in the original Ideas submission (Update: barrel style crow&#39;s nests were apparently an invention long post-dating the golden age of piracy)).</p>

<p>Despite these caveats, I think this is one of the best sailing ships that LEGO has produced and do not hesitate to recommend it to fans of pirates and sailing ships.</p>

<p>(Update: I fiddled a bit with installing cannons for the starboard gundeck. The main obstruction is the tavern wall and bar section that blocks much of the frontmost gun port. Most of this can be easily removed, but I built a vertical support from some wall pieces to provide vertical support for the front corner of the upper deck plate. A single plate is also needed to prop up the 2<sup>nd</sup> deck support slightly higher as the bar table performs that role in the main build. Another issue is that the inverted bow pieces used as part of the interior hull construction (while looking nice) prevent certain cannons from being pushed very far into the gun ports, which are also built too high for the cannons. By removing the wheeled carriages and raising the cannons up by 1 brick + 1-2 plates, I was able to get all 4 cannons in consistent, satisfactory positions. Although I think it would look better if the cannons protruded out slightly further, placing all 4 cannons closer to the hull would require either further reconstruction to relocate/replace some of the inverted bow pieces and/or using modified single stud (jumper) plates in the elevation and positioning of the cannons. It also slightly bothers me that the cannon flap for the 3<sup>rd</sup> gun port cannot raise as far as the others due to the protruding rigging construction. In conclusion, while modding the ship to properly include guns is not too difficult, I really wish that the set had been properly designed for this option in the first place!)</p>

It has tons of easter egg throwbacks to the original Pirates theme, and was an interesting and creative build. My daughter absolutely loved building it with me, and it has appeal to both adult and child fans of LEGO (although it&#39;s probably too challenging for younger kids without adult assistance, since parts of the build are somewhat complicated).</p>

<p>There are 8 windows for cannons, but only 3 cannons supplied? It is difficult to separate and reconnect the pirate ship. And NO PLANK??! What kind of pirate ship doesn&#39;t have a plank!?!</p>

<p>I have since customised it to make it a better pirate ship, and not have the ship become the island like the set wants to do.&nbsp;</p>

"HeadFax","2020-08-05T23:22:39.667Z","""Shiver me timbers, I'm a-sailin' away.""","<p>I just finished building this, the largest and most complex Lego set that I own. There&#39;s honestly very little I can say about it that hasn&#39;t already been said, but I need to tell <strong>someone</strong>&nbsp;about it, so I&#39;m writing this review anyway.</p>

<p>This set is incredible, and building it and playing with it are as close as I&#39;ve come to recapturing the joy and wonder that Lego brought to my childhood. I have many smaller Pirates sets going back to the late 80s and early 90s, including the original Imperial Flagship (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6271-1/Imperial-Flagship"" onclick=""window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;"">6271</a>) and Trading Post (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6277-1/Imperial-Trading-Post"" onclick=""window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;"">6277</a>), both formidable sets in their own right. But the twin crown jewels of the original Pirates line were the Black Seas Barracuda (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6285-1/Black-Seas-Barracuda"" onclick=""window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;"">6285</a>) and the Skull&#39;s Eye Schooner (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6286-1/Skull-s-Eye-Schooner"" onclick=""window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;"">6286</a>), enormous and intricately detailed clipper ships with close to 1,000 pieces each (a staggering amount to an 11-year-old). I never had any sets approaching their&nbsp;level of awesome.</p>

<p>Until now.</p>

<p>I heard about this set right after it passed through the Ideas approval process, and I did my best to keep an eye out for it to be released. Unfortunately, the initial stock was gone in a flash, and I was relegated to reading about other people&#39;s experiences with it. Despite the mountains of hype that reviewers piled onto this set, I remained cautiously optimistic about it. But the minute I unboxed it and opened the (quite substantial) instruction manual, I knew this set was the real deal.</p>

<p>Putting this set together was a very rewarding experience. For as large and detailed as this set is, most of it is very solidly built with firm connections. I enjoyed the clever build techniques used to achieve the ship&#39;s form, like the angled walls of the hull and aft sections. I feel like a lot of thought went into creating something that straddled the line between being realistic and paying homage to a bygone Lego era. Some features genuinely surprised me, such as the way the aft wall swings down to allow access to the galley and captain&#39;s quarters.</p>

<p>I also appreciated the extensive attention that the designers paid to detail. The captain&#39;s quarters are packed full of interesting Lego rarities, like a fold-away bunk, an armchair, a plaster bust, and so on. The island also has plenty of appropriate detail strewn about: crates of food, barrels full of tools and weapons, a partially-sunken idol, etc. But, as odd as it may seem, the detail that stands out the most to me? The bottles. This set comes with an array of minifigure-scale bottles. This feels to me like a nod to the fact that this set is geared towards an older audience, because it would be a stretch (for adults, anyway) to assume they&#39;re&nbsp;for anything other than holding rum. For better or worse, drunken debauchery is a central element of the pirate genre, and it would have felt&nbsp;like a cheap sanitization if the set hadn&#39;t included some reference to it.</p>

<p>Speaking of pirates, the set comes with a suitable army of minifigures. Some of them are clear call-backs to earlier sets. The new Captain Redbeard is essentially a High-Definition version of the old one. The Broadside Twins are obviously updated versions of the generic moustachioed, striped shirt-wearing pirates of the old days. Other figures are new and unique, like Tattooga and Robin Loot, and this mismatched band of rogues fits together perfectly, like one big&nbsp;happy, dysfunctional family.</p>

<p>But this island set is massive, and I felt it could use a few more inhabitants, so I ordered a few loose pirate minifigures from sets spanning the years to join the fun. I appear to have overlooked the fact that Lego at some point produced a pirate cook, so I guess I&#39;m going to have to track him down. After all, what&#39;s a shipwreck tavern without someone slinging drinks?</p>

<p>And somehow, despite the incredible detail and playability of the island, this set still has more to offer. The set comes with the necessary parts to transform the shipwreck into a seaworthy vessel, and the instructions to do so. I haven&#39;t tried to do this myself yet, but the end result is somewhat of a modernized version of the original Black Seas Barracuda. The decision to incorporate a second model into this set, and for that model to be a re-imagining of such a pivotal, historic set, was truly a stroke of genius.</p>

<p>Truth be told, there are only a couple of extremely minor things that I think could have been improved upon. Some areas of the ship are very delicately put together, and extreme care should be taken when playing with them. The ones I noted right off the bat were the crow&#39;s nests (merely affixing a minifigure to one of them is enough force to accidentally break off a part) and the exterior walkway directly outside the captain&#39;s quarters (it is held on only by a pair of technics pins, and I can foresee those becoming bent during play).</p>

<p>Otherwise, I can find no fault with this set. It&#39;s costly, yes, but I genuinely feel that it delivers more than enough value to justify its price tag. This set represents Lego at its very best: iconic imagery, exquisite detail, endless playability.</p>

"Skeletonwizard8","2021-11-10T20:42:16.257Z","Incredible","<p>I&#39;ve always loved pirates. I loved Pirates of the Caribbean as a kid. I wasn&#39;t around for the original Pirates sets from the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s, but always looked at them in awe. I finally got the chance to experience the Pirates theme with this set. It&#39;s one of my favorite sets of all time. The number of details and intricacy and care put into the build is incredible. The fact that it transforms from an island to a ship just adds to the value. The minifigs are excellent, I love Redbeard&#39;s hook hand. Parrots, pigs, crabs, etc- so many animals. I love the coral under the ship as well, and all the hidden details and Easter eggs that you will have to discover if you build this for yourself. I&#39;m so glad I decided to get this over the Stranger Things set. Looks wonderful in either the ship or island form. The set also looks huge for 200$, especially when compared to other sets such as the Cantina while in the island form. My only gripe with the set is it&#39;s hard to access some of the interior and some parts fall off quite easily, particularly the palm trees which will break apart from the slightest touch. This is more of a display model, so I can forgive it in that regard.</p>

"Spruce","2021-01-11T15:55:16.427Z","Pirates of Barracuda Bay, LEGO set 21322","<p><strong>Pre-Release Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>I wasn&#39;t very interested in this set upon the time of its reveal. I thought i was just another IDEAS set and I also didn&#39;t have much space in my collection. My birthday happened though, and I decided that this was the one big set I wanted.</p>

<p><b>Build Experience</b></p>

<p>I definitely had a great time building this model. The strings were not a problem, thankfully, because I know we all HATE string in LEGO sets. The strings are studded, making for better connections, and you get an extra long and short strings. The only thing I had a problem with was the rigging. Those large pieces were a PAIN.</p>

<p><b>Model&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>The model is one of those large display and play models. I can see a small kid having a blast with this set because of the fun interior of the ship and I can see someone putting this up on display for large stature and vibrant colors. It&#39;s a sturdy model as long as you&#39;re careful with the masts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The island build is strong, using many of the&nbsp;large curved pieces in tan to represent sand. There are plenty of details on the water, like rocks and a couple of crabs. There are 3 coconut trees located on the island, using minifigure head pieces in medium nougat to represent the coconuts.</p>

<p>The sand area has many details packed on top of it, like the remains of a statue, reminiscent of older LEGO sets. When the pirate ship is removed, you get a clearer look at the area. A lot of wood is still remaining, and one part of the ship remains intact. There is a balcony near the coconut trees with bright orange flowers hanging off of it. The wall of the pirate ship that remains is right above a stairway that leads to more sand.</p>

<p>The pirate ship itself is split into three pieces. The back of the ship has the captain&#39;s cabin and the kitchen&nbsp;underneath. The captain&#39;s cabin has a fancy chair, cleverly using the candle pieces in gold for arm rests. It also has a chest and a bed which can be lifted and put on the wall. The kitchen below has a furnace and a cutting board with a fish on it. The top of this section has a couple of crates and the ship&#39;s wheel. When attached to the island, a wooden board is hung off of the back of the ship that holds the ship&#39;s wheel. Along with that, the windows are boarded up and vines are coming out of the ship. Additionally, the rudder is placed as a door to the kitchen, which can be replaced with a wooden window when the ship is being rebuilt.</p>

<p>The middle section has the largest sail placed on it. The mast goes on the center of the deck, along with boxes and barrels. Stairs are placed on this section, which lead to the ship&#39;s wheel. When on the island, a prison cell is places in between the stairs which hold a skeleton, quite a grim feature in this otherwise lighthearted and fun set. Only one of the rigging pieces is places when on the island, while the other one can be attached when the boat is getting off of the island. Both of them are attached to the sides and the crow&#39;s nest.&nbsp;When put on the island, the interior becomes an inn named Jose&#39;s Inn. Bottles are placed on a table and a dispenser is placed alongside them. On the other side, closer to the ship&#39;s kitchen, two beds are placed, colored red and light blue. Eight windows are located on the sides of the ship. They are meant for cannons, but the ship only contains three.</p>

<p>The bow of the ship is attached to the island with ball joints, cleverly disguised as parts of rocks. They give this section an angle when displayed with the other parts of the ship. Inside, we can find the toilet and a small bucket. The anchor is placed on the deck. The ship is a yellow figure with a recolor of the Aquaman hair in yellow. Four yellow bendable joints attach to it. Another mast is attached to this section, and stair are placed to allow access to a balcony at the front of the ship. The rigging pieces are both attached to the crow&#39;s nest on top.</p>

<p>When on the island, the sails are rolled up and barrels are put on the wooden docks. Many sails and ropes are not used while the boat is stranded on the island.</p>

<p>I edited this model to include more cannons, which is a fairly easy modification.</p>

<p><b>Value</b></p>

<p>This has decent value. It feels like $200, although the price per part ratio isn&#39;t spectacular. Definitely worth it though, for the volume of things and for the playability of the model.</p>

<p><b>Minifigures</b></p>

<p>The standout figure of this set is certainly the iconic Captain Redbeard. His red bear still stands out and all the printing on him looks crisp and clean. He has a peg leg and a hook for an arm, and also wields a sword. Quartermaster Riggings comes with a new torso print and a buccaneer hat. He holds a map and a sword. Lady Anchor is also included, and her red outfit looks especially nice. She comes with a machete and a revolver.</p>

<p>Port and Starboard are basically color-swapped versions of each other. Port has blue stripes on his torso with a red beanie and pants. Starboard is the exact opposite. Both wield a musket and a sword.</p>

<p>Robin Loot uses a new buccaneer hat and hair combo, her defining feature. She is equipped with two revolvers. Jack &ldquo;Dark Shark&rdquo; Doubloons is included with short legs, implying that he may be a child. He has a satchel and a telescope as accessories.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, Tattooga is present, named after the tattoos all over his body. He has a sword.</p>

<p><b>Pros:</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Gorgeous colors</li>
	<li>Great ambience</li>
	<li>Value is above average</li>
	<li>High play value for a large set</li>
	<li>Build can convert</li>
	<li>Fun build experience</li>
	<li>Interesting building techniques</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Cons:&nbsp;</b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Pricey</li>
	<li>Fragile masts</li>
	<li>Hard to build for younger fans</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>The set exceeded my expectations for it. The figures use a simplistic but nice design and the model is complex yet still fun to play in. Hardly any critiques with this one, and I recommend this for any big LEGO fans.</p>
