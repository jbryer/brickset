<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>I must admit, that it&#39;s closer to the original than I was expecting. The size and proportions are really good. Starting from the front, I like the way they designed the nose. It&#39;s angled a bit, which makes it triangle-ish. It&#39;s really looks great i such small scale. The transition between nose and canopy is hard to judge. At sides its done pretty well, using curved bricks, but in the middle section, there is just a tile attached in between of two plates. It&#39;s a creative use of bricks to make it, but it looks awful. Tile is too thick and stand out too much. There is also some kind of stand underneath this tile, (which is out of place and useless, it&#39;s hardly possible to make this ship stand still) which makes this tile rise up a bit. There are some gaps in the front nose, but it doesn&#39;t bother me much.</p>

<p>Rear part, the canopy looks much better. It&#39;s rounded using nice amount of round bricks. Lower part of cabin is a disk attached via stick, which is a great technic. Upper section uses a new 3x3 dome, available in one other set if I remember&nbsp;correctly. There is also a pair&nbsp;grill tiles underneath it, which adds a simple yet pleasing detail. Flags used as a wing of this craft looks perfect as well, though they don&#39;t fold like they should and are the weakest part in term of stability. They are used as a &#39;legs&#39; of this craft.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>As I mentioned before, there is a new 3x3 dome, available only in Trafalgar Square set before. It is quite useful part. Grey dish and round plate are always welcome, set of four flags is a great addition. Rest of the parts is pretty straight forward, nothing fancy, yet useful.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>It is set really hard to rate. Back part is great, nose is weak. Dome is perfect, stability is poor. I must say that this set is just OK. Parts for sure rise the value of its. It&#39;s a good and cheap way to get this new part and some other useful ones.&nbsp;</p>
