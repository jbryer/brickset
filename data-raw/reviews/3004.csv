"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-18T17:42:02Z","Great small castle.","Well, this is one of my favorite sets. First of all because of the skeleton which was newly introduced this year. Second, there is a nice new colorful knight with shield. (unfortunately without the new greatsword. But you can't have it all.)
And third, most important, because of the many castle building-parts in this set! There is one castle turret-top, and five(!) castle wall-parts! And even better, one of them has that special &quot;window and pilars&quot;print, which was not visible in the catalog. So that was a big and pleasant surprise when i got this set. I was eleven. :)

This set is a real pleasure for castle-freaks.

"Novelty","2007-05-09T08:03:47.243Z","Looks can be deceiving","This is a rather nice castle building - it makes good use of the printed bricks and the design is rather visually nice.  However there's a few things not going on for it.  Firstly, there's no connector bricks at the end of the wall to connect it to any other wall piece so it's mostly a stand-alone piece of wall... and that makes it weird.  It would have been better if it was a tower.  Secondly, there's no way up to the roof of the structure, not even a ladder.  Thirdly, there's no door to the room with the skeleton.

The swinging skeleton is nicely done and is interesting the first and second times or so.  It gets old pretty soon.  Also the design is a bit lacking - if the skeleton isn't positioned properly, the arms drop down and is visible from the entrance of the &quot;arch&quot; (remember, there's no door).",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"Gus_263","2008-04-18T15:24:51.043Z","Skeleton Surprise","This isn't a very small set, but it don't have much contents. Due to it, this set deserves be reviewed to one middle set. The builting is easy, to make the tower and a little wall on one side of it. The color scheme have gray and black, like in the printed wall. The roof have a pit to play with the skeleton, turning greater the playability inside or outside the building. The black wall is useful, can be putted in any plate or be increseament like wall of floors on towers. The colors also makes the set useful due to be used in another sets like of the black knights subtheme. The set includes too an original skeleton(with a simple but better design than the new castle ones) with more playable arms, and a minifigure of a royal knight, these that are from this subtheme. Itens like a flag, the common helmet and a chalice are useful, to make a lego medieval scenery. Plates also are contents inside of the chamber(this don't have a door, but is easy hide the skeleton inside it), and outside this, is easy put another pieces in the system pieces with holes, like technic ones. Ramp pieces and fire pieces makes a good effect to the entrance, and are good positioned. Another cool thing is the gray pieces above the tower, these makes the set looks like with medieval forts. Altough this set don't have doors or a completed roof, these things makes the playabilty inside of the building better and this had a correct price to the contents(now the old sets can be more expensive). Overall, this is a great set of this subtheme, deserving a 5/5 rate.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Odeinoichus","2010-11-25T16:47:04.303Z","Surprise! It's a Skeleton","<p>Set #6036 Skeleton Surprise: From the Royal Knights comes this little gem of a set - a small fort to hide and protect the treasure from prying eyes, guarded by a terrifying skeleton and protected by the knight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This simple set also has an interesting gimmick. The skeleton is attached to a Technic Rod piece and can be flipped down to startle invading enemy knights. Sadly mine can't perform this trick anymore because I am missing a few pieces, not as many as my Dark Forest Bandit Ambush set, but enough that I can't build the fort the way the instructions tell you to. (I lost those too.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get two mini-figures with this, a treasure chest, spear and shield, plus the golden goblet. (I'm not sure why he's drinking on the job, but then again it could be a distraction for thieves or perhaps the Holy Grail is being kept here.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To conclude this review I say this set is greatly recommended to all Castle fans who enjoy having more than just large castles as part of their display, and if you're really creative you could even turn this into a small add on piece to any castle. The pieces are quite versatile (as evidenced by some of the many different constructs I've built using what I managed to save from the donation bins.)</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,5,4
"Naylus","2022-01-06T21:30:04.467Z","A Tower of the Smiling Dead","<p><em>Royal Knights</em> could have been a common step forward in terms of the Castle theme, but Lego made a real breakthrough with the introduction of a Skeleton minifigure with the new series. Towers and other builds would include this new character after 1995 and there are reasons for him to be among top favourites ever since.</p>

<p><strong>General overview</strong><br />
This is a small structure, perhaps an outpost not far from the&nbsp;castle of <em>King Richard </em>(as revealed in one of the Lego catalogues). It includes a small room with a yellow goblet and a wall &ndash; ideal to be combined with a larger defence layout. The construction is mostly black and grey, but one wall includes a cool mediaeval&nbsp;print, imitating old stones. Two fire torches are a minor decoration here, while the room itself includes a mechanism with a small trap.</p>

<p><strong>The Gatekeeper(s)</strong><br />
We might assume, that the guard is protecting both the goblet and the entrance, but most likely the Skeleton itself is the real keeper of the tower here. Even though he is attached to a small trap to scare off possible thieves, he is also the major attraction here. Unlike classic minifigures he has a unique joints system, which give certain flexibility to arms.</p>

<p>The guard is pretty classic in design &ndash; an old black helmet and a red/blue uniform. The head has a smiling face with moustache. He has a Royal Knights sigil on his chest as well as on the shield, and&nbsp;armed with a spear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Back in 1995 this was probably one a few sets to include a Skeleton and the only small one (this minifigure also appears in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6090-1/Royal-Knight-s-Castle"">a much larger Royal Castle</a>). This was also the very first design, which had a minor drawback: arms were easily detachable and could be lost in no time (and extra arm included in the set).</p>

While small, you still have a good fortress that you can have a good time playing with against other castle genres. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All I can do now is just kick myself.

"AETerry","2012-10-24T00:36:42.493Z","Skeleton Surprise Review","<p>This was a fun little set back when I got it. It's one of the few Royal Knights sets I have as at the time, I was still very partial to the original factions of Black Falcons, Crusaders and Black Monarch minifigures.<br></p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are in LEGO's easy to follow step-by-step illustrations in booklet form. As this is an older set, there's no catalog or inventory of pieces at the back of the booklet or anything else to it.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>As far as Castle sets go, this has a good number of pieces at 74. Many of which are great additions for a Castle. You have a few of solid wall pieces that are decorated/printed. A couple of the then new flame pieces, gold cup and flag. As a small set, you've also got a rather small 8x16 base plate. Perfect for creating small MOCs and vignette scenes with.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get two minifigures in this set. The Royal Knight who gets scared out of his wits by the falling skeleton. When these versions of skeletons first came out, a small set like this was perfect in terms of price for getting one of these new minifigures.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>I've always viewed this set as being either the entrance to a tomb or a forgotten outpost given the way the skeleton in this set falls down to scare the wits out of the Royal Knight figure. In all there's plenty of decent and specialized pieces. All perfect for complementing a larger Castle collection. I've also appreciated this set for not having any of the technic connecting pins that would suggest this is part of a larger play set and can stand out on it's own for play an display.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,5
"clundsberg","2011-05-02T01:08:42.08Z","Skeleton Surprise? I don't see any skel...GAAAH!","<p>Just rummaged through my sorted legos and managed to quickly put this one together which just goes to show how far I've come in rebuilding all of my old legos.&nbsp; It's a nice little set worthy of picking up and adding to your castle theme.</p>
<p>The pieces are comprised of black and light grey bricks. (the most original of the bunch are the pole the skeleton swings down&nbsp;from, the forward protruding castle ledge piece and the wall piece that is painted with grey bricks and pillars) The treasure is a simple yellow chalice - perhaps to mimick the Holy Grail? (especially since the knight bears a Lion crest on his shield)</p>
<p>Set comes with mini-figs of knight and skeleton.&nbsp; The structure takes up most of the green plate you build upon.&nbsp; The remaining space is nice as an area to display the knight.</p>
<p>It's a nice sturdy little fortress with room for maybe a figure or two, however the only access to the interior is through the doorway.&nbsp; There are no male/female pieces that allow you to merge this set with other castle pieces like the earlier castle sets.&nbsp; The skeleton action comes from removing a jousting pole that holds the skeleton in place. Upon doing so the skeleton swoops down blocking the doorway and scaring the cra-pola out of yonder knight.&nbsp; How he gets back up on his own is anybody's guess.&nbsp; Simple enough mechanics but a fun gimmick regardless.&nbsp; If you invert the castle when setting the trap, you can pin the skeleton's arms down with the jousting pole pretty much concealing him from sight.</p>
<p>Only flaw with this set is the roof. a couple of pieces could have been added to cover some holes and make the top completely useable.&nbsp; </p>
<p>This is a great little set if you are a fan of medieval or the castles systems or semi-retro legos. (this is the era where they began printing a bit more detail on the faces, but everyone was still smiling) Worthy of any collection.</p>",TRUE,5,4,5,3,4
"Harmonious_Building","2011-12-06T21:54:06.95Z","Skeleton in the closet.","<div>There was always something inherently cool about LEGO skeletons. I think part of the appeal was that it was a Minifig-sized character that wasn’t actually a Minifig in the sense that it didn’t have the traditional torso/legs/arms that every other Minifig up until then had. The same thing was true of the ghost that came with some Black Knights’ sets (which, incidentally, I think needs to make an IMMEDIATE comeback), but the skeleton took it to a whole new level, a level that was later replicated with things like the Star Wars droids, characters with non-spherical-ish heads, and so on.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>So basically, the skeleton is an amazing creation.</div><div><br></div><div>The Royal Knights line eschewed fantasy in favour of returning to a more classic flavour of Castle, so the skeleton really embodied the only sense of whimsy in the whole subtheme, and just about all of that whimsy found itself contained in Skeleton Surprise. Long before I had enough grown-up-money to get the incredible Royal Knights’ Castle (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6090-1"">6090</a>), I only had the lone fort of Skeleton Surprise, and hopefully it is not while wearing Nostalgia Goggles that I say that Skeleton Surprise makes for a very visually pleasing and sturdy fort. What is the lone guard protecting, and why on earth is there a mechanism in which a skeleton swings down to unsuspecting trespassers? Was the mechanism put in the fort later, or is it some kind of weird torture device by which some poor soul was made to expire upon and left to rot? These and other questions were questions that I may or may not have asked myself when I wasn’t asking why I couldn’t get 6090. Anyway, Skeleton Surprise gives you a very useful handful of castle pieces, and creative sorts could surely get away with a more impressive structure with just a couple of these sets, I’m sure.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>As mentioned in my King’s Carriage (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?set=6044-1"">6044</a>) review, I do partially judge sets based on their overall thematic coherence, and Skeleton Surprise gets top marks here. A few connecting pieces is all you need to attach Skeleton Surprise to the Royal Knights’ Castle, in which it can serve a more sensible role as a guardhouse of some sort.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I love smaller sets that complement the flagship one of a particular line, and Skeleton Surprise does this job very well.

"TopFloorBricks","2021-02-10T17:02:48.497Z","Surprising, Satisfying and Just a Little Scary!","<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Structure based sets are usually expensive (think of the amount of different castles we&#39;ve had over the years) so it&#39;s always a treat when you get a smaller one as it can really help to add some permanence to any scenes or set-ups you put together. It&#39;s even better when the details, features and overall design make the set&nbsp;a little gem such as with Skeleton Surprise.</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The building operates a black and light grey colour scheme, very much in keeping with the general Royal Knights appearance. It makes the building look organised and serious, in contrast with the haphazard way that Fright Knights buildings are put together or the natural look of Dark Forest buildings, perfectly in keeping with the vibe of the subtheme. Some may grumble at the fact only one panel has the grey column/window pattern but I like this. It makes that piece feel more exclusive. They could have perhaps put it on the extending wall in order to give symmetry to the actual building, but one could easily swap the panels themselves if they so wished. I certainly do. I like the use of the baseplate as this gives ample room in front of that extended wall for a set piece, perfect for an extra guard to stand, a cookfire to be placed or a small cart parked.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t really mind the use of a large piece for the crenellations although I&#39;m sure it would have been more fun to build them from scratch using smaller pieces. My only real quibble up here is that you get a small hole when you put the plate in at the top. Maybe it is deliberate and there for the guard to perform maintenance on the skeleton mechanism. I&#39;ll give the designers the benefit of the doubt!</p>

<p><strong>The Features</strong></p>

<p>The swinging mechanism itself is a good one. Sometimes these can be unreliable,&nbsp;fiddly to reset or the surprise looks blindingly obvious! I don&#39;t think this trap falls into any of those, well, traps! I tend to find it works smoothly and you can easily swing the skeleton back up to his well hidden position.</p>

<p>You get a flag, some torches and a goblet, which the instructions tell you to place inside the building. This is perhaps a little frugal. I&#39;m sure they could have found room for a barrel at least and maybe some clips or a hook on the wall to store an extra weapon because I feel our little guard friend is considerably unequipped with his spear and shield, especially if the building was attacked from range. Give him a bow for goodness sake! I find his trousers a bit showy as well for a lowly guard but again, very easy to swap for some black ones from a different set. I must say I love the shield design, though I would have added a second one to be attached to the building, just to show its allegiance. I would also add in a ladder for access to the battlements. There is certainly room at the back for this.</p>

<p><strong>The Play</strong></p>

<p>From reading other reviews there seems to be some disagreement as to the role of the minifigure. Others make reference to him being scared witless by the surprise skeleton, but I always had him as being in on the joke and the bony friend was an extra defence mechanism in the building he was manning. As stated above there is plenty of room for set pieces though you probably need at least one other minifigure to do this effectively. It would also&nbsp;pair nicely with any sort of carriage or wagon that could pass by, whether hostile or friendly.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not clear from the instructions what this building is supposed to be but that just means you can decide for yourself. A guardhouse/outpost seems the most obvious function, especially with the battlements. This is handy as it doesn&#39;t need to be attached to a larger castle and can be a standalone building. If there were clips inside you could turn it into an armoury. Fairly straightforward to add them in if you have the requisite extra pieces. It could work as a storeroom but I feel this would impede the skeleton, which is of course the main feature of the set. My favourite use of this set was a little more left field. I incorporated it into my Town setup as a visitor attraction, with the guard taking on the role of an English Heritage employee giving visitors tours. It was great for my Town inhabitants to take a trip to and just shows how different themes can be combined in innovative ways.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Efficient, well-designed and with a cool surprise, this set is a really nice addition to any Castle collection. It is a little sparse on extra details or items, but this issue falls away when paired with other sets. A definite pick up if you can find one for a decent price.</p>
