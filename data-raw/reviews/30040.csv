<p>I&#39;m not a fan of the Fast and Furious films (never actually seen one; just don&#39;t interest me), so I&#39;m not the main target audience for this, I guess.</p>

<p>The build wasn&#39;t very exciting: it offers little more than the smaller vehicles and there were quite a few very fiddly sections that seemed a little out of sequence. The final model is quite flimsy for the size: it flexes in every direction and doesn&#39;t feel very solid when picked up. Certainly not up to the solid build of Technic in general. Seems to be aimed at display, rather than play, which rather defeats the point of the functions. On that front, it offers little play value over smaller technic vehicles: working V8 engine, hand-of-God steering, opening doors and boot (trunk), and the strange (to me) lift function operated by a fiddly lever in the cabin.</p>

<p>The parts were the main draw for me &mdash; a great selection and quantity of black panels &amp; beams, V8 engine, nice set of wheels &amp; tyres &amp; a full suspension pack. So if that lot interests you, this set is worth considering for parts alone.</p>

<p>At full price, this is definitely expensive, but it&#39;s regularly discounted online (that&#39;s how I bought it), and then it&#39;s pretty good value.</p>

It went together very easy. Also it was much bigger than I thought it would be. It&#39;s not played with but I&#39;d imagine it would hold pretty well with kids playing with it. I&#39;m definitely looking to buy more Technic sets.&nbsp;</p>
