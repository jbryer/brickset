<p>-first,is the torso and there&rsquo;s icicles&nbsp;and body armour on the torso.It has nice&nbsp;colour&nbsp;hands which is light&nbsp;blue.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;Next is the trousers with more armour and icicles&nbsp;</p>

<p>-&nbsp;Then the shoulder and chest armour which is white with more icicles.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;now is the head which is light trans-blue.It has&nbsp;icy&nbsp;eyebrows&nbsp;and a menacing&nbsp;grin.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;I think that the helmet is extra cool with the icicles sticking out of the white helmet.</p>

<p>-&nbsp;The weapon is good as well.</p>

<p>Overall, I think this is a good set worth getting,especially with the magazine.</p>
