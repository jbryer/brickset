"Novelty","2007-06-16T07:26:20.763Z","Heart of Dragon","The concept of this set is cool - make the dragon carry a gondola.  The execution though is bad and the end result seems to be parts thrown together.  The dragon harness is weirdly done - it would have been better if it was extended to have a dragon in front and a dragon behind.  The pirate ladders is an interesting touch to hold up the gondola and although it works, it isn't very aesthetically pleasing.  The gondola is just a mismash of pieces from the axes in front to the weird bits behind.  The only good thing was the use of a crystal ball as a &quot;rudder&quot;.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

The positive things: The dragon, the Witch mini figure and the crystal ball piece. Found it on clearance at a low price, picked it up for the reasons already mentioned. Odd set with some cool parts it so so.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-17T14:42:49.873Z","Why rate this set low?","This is one cool set of the fright knights subtheme, don't have a minifigure of one, but have a dragon in little size and a minifigure of a witch. This set have useful pieces to make the plate.The yellow parts under the base of the set makes this keep in feet, and are very useful to make buildings. Is included some itens like the axes in the front and a crystal ball. Another itens are from the minifigure, like the staff and hat. The witch's minifigure don't have a leg piece, but one ramp piece in the place of it, to looks like with a dress. Claw pieces keeps the rails on the side and in the plate above the dragon. The green dragon is cool, in it can be putted wings, but the wings in this set are on a normal piece with claw pieces and plates above the dragon, but this system still playable.The rails are also useful to make sets like the &quot;Aero Nomad&quot;, from Orient Expedition. The pieces in different shape of the base where is putted the witch are useful to make too underwater vehicles, or again sets like the Aero Nomad. If the location of the dragon frustrate the playability, is easy, put the wings on it and play with this. The pieces in overall, are useful, and the set have great building possibilitties, with those pieces is easy makes another set. The set is easy to play with, holding under the set and play with minifigures, weapons, or dragons. The dragon isn't great like the viking's ones, but have a good size to minifigures.

"zipper","2012-10-06T09:10:11.227Z","Well...you get a dragon with it","<p>Honestly, when I received this set when I was a kid, I was a bit disapointed. My first thoughts were, 'yes, I get a witch and a dragon!' but when it all comes together it's not well executed. Plus I already had a dragon with a different set. So then I was happy that I had a witch (to compliment my wizard minifig), but even the witch comes apart kinda easily. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You get some good pieces (crystal ball) but that's about it.</p>",TRUE,3,5,2,2,3
"AETerry","2011-01-18T14:35:57.03Z","Witch's Windship Review","<p>I'm not sure you could actually call this a Windship... it's more closer to a Hotair Balloon, only instead of a balloon, it's a dragon carrying the ship... basket that the witch is riding in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The side riggings are clearly suggestive of the ropes creating the harness for the dragon. It's just a funny little build. But it's perfect for getting a dragon... a pair of black dragon wings, so if you want to switch out the red wings on a black dragon and make it truely solid black, this set is a good place to get the parts. The witch minifigure who's fun and more closer to a Wizard of Oz approach... her wand, broom and crystal ball are good too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So there's plenty of fun elements and minifigure and dragon to get from this set, it just boils down to be a little funny or odd in the execution of the design.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,4
