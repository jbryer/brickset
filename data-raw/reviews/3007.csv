"Novelty","2007-04-10T06:13:24.13Z","Two arm bandit?","This is a nice little set with a solid base and a solid catapult body.  The design is good enough to provide space to store the yellow &quot;rocks&quot; on the cart itself.  The two catapault are basically sea-saws, but have been disguised with a scoop at one end for the object to be thrown.  Again, this could have done with a harness point so that a horse could be made to pull it - the horse is even provided in this set.  The knight is good though, although it doesn't really go together with the catapault and seems more like an exercise to increase the piece count of the set.  Still, it's a solid set overall.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-09T11:20:30.89Z","Twin catapult","This is basically a catapult from the lion knights subtheme, and this have wheels, but can't be rided, due to the size. This set is made too by two knights and a covered horse. The catapult can shoots more than one shots with one launcher, and more due to the other. These two are capable to launch in the same time. The systems that can do that are well made with black pieces in the piles above the base and wheels of the catapult. Little additions are in this set, like the two flags and spears, that can replace the weapons of the knights. Is easy to see the pieces that can be launched, are small, but if others putted in the launcher, will be minus shots that this will do. These shots can be putted as piles or don't to be carried by the catapult, or be putted one inside the little barrel on the front of the catapult. The minifigure are well made, with little differences, like the weapons. These looks like be the same, but aren't, they are great to make armies, using or don't other weapons. Overall, this is a catapult good to play with and the minifigures and the horse are army builders. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-10-30T19:31:46.153Z","Double Whammy","I like sets with double catapults because it gives more power to the catapult and can do some damage. The shields I notice are very interesting because I have never seen any like these. The horse is pretty nice in this set too. 5 out of 5 for an awesome set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-18T15:03:09.02Z","Twin-Arm Launcher Review","<p>This isn't a bad catapult design from Lego and they've done many over the years with their Castle themes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This particular catapult build stands out in that it has two launchers in it. So while one has fired, the other can be loaded. Added to that is that this one is on wheels providing it mobility and being able to be moved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's a barrel with two yellow round flat 1x1 elements to suggest gold. Two minifigures, both are armed with one of the minifigures able to ride horse back and provide some cover or protection for the other minifigure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's decent build and adds to the Lion's Men army for castle attacks.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,5
"Ernst","2011-06-18T17:42:01.487Z","A realistic looking weapon","<p>Overall this is a very nice set, a good addition to have when you want to conquer the enemy Castle. Simply a nice, colourfull and practical set to own.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building the launcher is like all small sets not hard but&nbsp;nice to do, an average 3 bricks here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some pro's and con's concerning the parts. I like the way both ends of the launchers can move, good thought there. Also clever are the neutral shields, if you remove the horses blanket you can use this set for other theme's too. For both knights a good amount of weapons in this set too. Strange color for the throwing bricks, grey or black would have been better than yellow. Missing is a trangle for the horse to move the cart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Good playability although the launcher does not really work well, also because the launchers bump on the wheels. But to be honest it does not really disturb me since Lego is invented to build with. Together with more sets it is good to play battle with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The average value is estimated by Bricklink at â‚¬15,00 which is about right I think for a 23 year old set&nbsp;in good condition, since I paid less I am happy with it.</p>",TRUE,4,3,3,4,4
