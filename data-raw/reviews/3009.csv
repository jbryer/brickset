It makes a nice peice for trying to build a town, or snaps right on to one of the older style castles, which linked together, to arm your warriors.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-04-03T07:21:02.623Z","Chim Chim Cheroo","This set isn't the first time that red slopes has been combined to form a burning place - Town has been doing it for a while as fireplaces, but this is the first instance that it has been mated with a wall to produce a furnace behind a wall, a design that has not been seen since (6067 has a partial version of this though).  This version has a wheel attached to the side... as an adornment perhaps?

This set is also one of the few to feature a non-soldier (along with 6010, 6055, 6103 and the promo set 1974), but this one is unique in the fact that it's not a merchant (or a merchant as a prisoner).  In fact this may be the only tradesman in the entire castle line.

The blacksmith, is armed with a hammer and a rake, but all he seems capable of crafting it seems are wheels.  The blue anvil is also of a weird design... and the colour is funny as well.  I would have been better if it was black.

Finally, there's a weird bit/bob connected to the horses harness that I have always wondered what it was for...",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-02-28T20:12:20.233Z","Nice little set.","Seeing this set, it's a real shame the eighties castle range didn't contain more civilian sets (there was also a weapons shop and, of course, the Daddy - the Guarded Inn).  This is a nice little model which includes a furnace and chimney built into a section of castle wall, a sentry, a horse with carriage attachment, a blacksmith and an anvil.  What is unique in themed Lego sets is that there are instructions for one of the alternative models - an early Creator prototype?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2008-01-01T14:35:27.123Z","Great blacksmith's shop","This set is brilliant. A blacksmith's shop is definitely needed in your kingdom to forge your own weapons. Unfortunately, there are not many weapons included though such a shop would certainly sell them all the time. You only get two wheels on which the blacksmith can work, but not a single weapon, ignoring the guard's axe. 

The red chimney is great and so is the blue anvil. Some people don't like the colours of those two things, but I don't really care. The blacksmith himself is a very rare piece. Well, actually it is his apron that is really rare. It is a minifig cape and it's the only cape that is brown. You won't find a brown one in any other set. It's too bad I lost the complete blacksmith with his apron a long time ago! :-(

The guard has no shield, but obviously a horese, or is it the blacksmith's?In another review of this set, someone mentions that the horse hitching with the black plate with wheel holder could be a bellow. I've also never figured out what it should depict. Maybe it's a bellow, maybe not. 

One very unique aspect of this set is that it comes with instuctions that show you how to build a different model. It's a little tower with a carriage. For the coach you need the horse, the horse hitching, the wheels and the wheelholding plates. Apart from the wheels you might have wondered why these things (horse, horse hitching, etc.) are included. Now you know! ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-09T15:29:54.967Z","The Blacksmith Shop","This is another small set from the castle theme, lion knights theme. Released in 1984, the Blacksmith shop have a nice color scheme, deign and building, in comparison with the size, and too includes useful pieces and have characteristics of a lego castle original set. The building involved, above the small green plate, have some gray blocks that makes some walls, and also, some different shapes to make effects like the &quot;windows&quot;, not exactly, but two holes on the wall looks like some windows in medieval style, with no glass. The furnace, made with a good shape, altough cannot fit a weapon inside it, still good due to the color, a red scheme with a black on some encurve small plates on the top. Are also included some weapons with this, because the blacksmith can &quot;make&quot; some weapons, with a small hammer. The horse minifigure is a good addition to this small set, and altough cannot moves the paws, like the other lego horses, stiil in a good shape, color (black scheme) and simple in some details, like the eyes. The knight minifigure included, a lion knight, includes a helmet and still in a simple but well made design, like other knights from the lego castle old years. The blcksmith is the more simple, but still well made, simple designed, and with a black cap. This is another set that can increase other castle sets with some pieces, and is well builted too.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Ernst","2011-12-26T17:22:00.053Z","Very good set with a civilian.","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks: </strong>this a very nice set if you want to&nbsp;complete a Medieval Scenery and a good addition for a general Castle fan. Very nice to look at and play with and to combine with all Castle sets.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building 3 bricks: </strong>a rather simple set and very easy to built with the large castle panels. The &quot;hardest&quot; part in fact is the chimney.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks: </strong>I love the way the chimney is built and the striking red color which returns in the carriage attachement of the cart. Good detail is that the carriage also is used to let the Blacksmith do his job. Another nice detail is the minifigure of the Blacksmith and the&nbsp;rare pitchfork.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks: </strong>the set itself can be used with the cart built and taken apart to show the work the Blacksmith can do. The knight can be used both as guard as well as owner of the cart. A great combination is possible if you own set 6041 (Armor shop) too, built together it is 100% complete !</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value 4 bricks:</strong> Bricklink gives an average value of &euro; 23,00 which is ok for a 24 year old set&nbsp;if it is complete including pitchfork and all, I paid less than half.</p>

"rab1234","2018-10-16T17:46:00.32Z","Excellent small classic castle set","<h2><strong>Overall Rating</strong></h2>

<p>This is one of the rare &#39;civilian&#39; castle sets from the 80&#39;s classic castle era and is a welcome and interesting change of pace.&nbsp; There are enough minifigs and accessories included for solid playability despite the small size.&nbsp; I had this as a kid and the forge managed to stay complete and get reused in a number of other MOCs over the years.&nbsp; It&#39;s still in a drawer to this day.&nbsp; I recently acquired a ton of classic castle with this set included and it was a joy to rebuild.</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>Overall this is a quick and satisfying build with the most interesting aspect being the forge construction.&nbsp; I did get a bit confused trying to follow the instructions when pulling Legos from a bulk purchase and attempted to build the cart alongside the shop before finally realizing (when I couldn&#39;t find another red arch) that the cart was for the alternate build.&nbsp; A few gripes with the design which I deduct from the building experience rating:&nbsp;</p>

<p>1) The blue anvil is sort of a weird color choice.&nbsp; Black seems like it would have been better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>2) There&#39;s no entrance to the shop!</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>Considering the small number of parts in this set, you get some decent variety with the interesting (somewhat rare) red slope pieces, a horse and cart piece, and of course the blacksmith himself with his exclusive brown apron.</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>Very good playability for the size.&nbsp; Every large castle city needs a place where the weapons are made.&nbsp; I always thought more civilian sets were needed in classic castle and this was a decent entry.</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>Good value at the time and it&#39;s held up thanks to a couple of rare parts as well.&nbsp; I&#39;d recommend picking one up at the right price if you like classic castle.</p>

"mediAFOL","2022-02-05T02:11:02.08Z","More grey Eighties","<p>Part of the Castle Wall collection of sets, there&#39;s really not much to the Blacksmith Shop. The ubiquitous 1980s grey castle panels bulk out what is only a small section of wall, rendering the build rather unsatisfying. The forge is a welcome splash of colour, though an odd one. Forges and chimneys are not generally red, and this iteration of Castle favoured grey over the more exuberant primary colours of Classic Castle. The red therefore sits uneasily with the new more realistic stone aesthetic. At a stretch, it could represent sandstone reddened over time by extreme heat. That might work with tan bricks, but grey limestone is more likely to have blackened with soot.</p>

<p>In summary, this set has some interest, but the wall compatibility with the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/62960"">Armor Shop</a> renders the two sets too similar for comfort.&nbsp;As an aside, is anyone able to get the wheel to balance on the improbably blue anvil as on the box?</p>
