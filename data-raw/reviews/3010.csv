"legotrainfan","2008-01-01T14:56:40.653Z","Needed to equip your soldiers","This shop is needed to supply your soldiers with the necessary equipment to go to battle. There are two parts which you find in only this set: the black sword and the special lion flag that the knight has on the top of his brown lance. 

I am not so fortunate with rare parts. I am always losing them. With this set I lost the black sword a long time ago. And the clips of the lion flag were damaged after playing with this set so often when I was a child. But I acquired the same flag from eBay and both its clips were ok. So take much care of the black sword and the flag!!

By the way, he knight has a red cape. Maybe you cannot see it in the picture well. And, of course, you get lots of weapons. Enough weapons to completely equip two soldiers. So buy it! Especially with set 6040 it is a nice addition to your medieval town.

"Novelty","2007-04-04T08:05:25.74Z","Come one, come all...","Is this a shop of some sort, or is this just a bad afterthought?  Firstly, the absence of a merchant - the &quot;shop&quot; is manned by a guy in chainmail - makes it seems less like a shop and more a supply depot.  The design is just the usual run of the mill wall with a roof inside, although it does get points for some embellishment for the insides of the shop.  The weapons rack is a nice touch, but it seems rather limited in scope.  And there are no armour for sell in an armoury as well.  The knight also seems odd with a flag instead of the usual pennant.  This is just a weird set overall, but it is good for parts.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-11T09:54:07.34Z","Weaponry","This is one of the classic small sets, a shop with contents to minifgures. It includes things to weaponry and armory. One cool set to play with and is useful also. This looks like with the shops of the middle ages in movies, where a knight go to catch more armors and weapons. The set don't includes swords, but have another weapons like the longbow and the spear or the spear of joust, that the knight hangs. The content of armors is basically two different types of helmets, one with the minifigure and the same placed in the shop, and another too placed in the shop. The building of the shop is great, and the pieces are useful. The red ramp pieces makes a good roof, and this have also flags on the top. Is easy the builting of the shop and of the place of the weapons, to put the shields, weapons and the helmets in these. Is included two minifigures, a knight and the owner of the shop, and also a white horse, this was used in sets of the same theme also. The playability is basic, because have only two minifigures and a horse, but if with the weapons or helmets, this turns greater.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Ernst","2011-12-26T17:54:17.46Z","Nice (half civilian) set which needs other sets.","<p>Overall it gets 3 stars: a nice set but a bit strange standing on its own, you defenitly need other sets to give it a place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building experience&nbsp;4 stars: again a very easy set to built, no hard parts. A starting 5 year old kid can do the job easily. The result is a small but stable building which looks nice with the red roof and available accesoires.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts get 5 stars: it is very complete with all kinds of weapons and a fence to show the weapons he offers. Only strange detail is that he sells both shields of Lion and Falcon Knights. I thought they were enemies or at least opposites ? The two mini figures are sufficient. One more good detail is the flag of the Knight, if still present it gives extra value to the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability&nbsp;4 stars: the set itself is not very playable, it needs other sets to get value. But combined with set 6040 (Blacksmith Shop) you have a great set. Another option is to place in the&nbsp;King's Castle 6080 to arm the Lion Knights.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value for money 4 stars: the Bricklink average shows € 25,00 which is ok for a 1986 set if it is complete.</p>

<h2><strong>Overall Rating</strong></h2>

<p>I just finished building this one again for the first time in 30 years and although a very quick build, it holds up as an excellent classic castle set, similar in size and design to: &nbsp; https://brickset.com/sets/6040-1/Blacksmith-Shop</p>

<p>This is another example of the rare &#39;civilian&#39; castle sets from the 80&#39;s classic castle era so gets some bonus points from me. Enough extra weapons and accessories are included to make this seem like a realistic shop and there&#39;s decent playability with 2 figures and a variety of shields and helmets.&nbsp; I rate this as one of the very best small classic castle sets along with Guarded Inn, Battering Ram, and Siege Tower.&nbsp; Although all 3 of these were about twice the size.&nbsp; Armor Shop is a notch above the comparably sized Blacksmith Shop in my opinion.</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>This is a very quick build especially if you don&#39;t have to search through a massive bin of parts to find what you need.&nbsp; There aren&#39;t any uncommon pieces in the building itself, so it still came together pretty quickly.&nbsp; There aren&#39;t really any challenging aspects to this build and the only interesting part is putting together the stand for the weapons.&nbsp; I do like the finished look though despite its simplicity.&nbsp; The red roof looks good and the black stand has a cool design from the front.</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>Not a lot of variety or rarity in the parts for the main building or display piece.&nbsp; The stand out parts here are the lion flag and of course the jet black classic sword.&nbsp; I recently sold a sword for $8 on bricklink and in my opinion, the buyer got a bargain.&nbsp; This is the only set the sword comes in in black and I remember as a kid prizing the black sword and giving it to my favorite knight.&nbsp; The flag I think is less interesting as there were other, similar flags during the era and it never really stood out as special to me.&nbsp; Either way, you&#39;ve got 2 unique parts that are only available here.</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>As mentioned above, playability is great on this one considering the size of the set.&nbsp; Certainly you could use it as part of a larger classic castle town, but even on its own with 2 knights and a variety of shields and weapons, you could play out a number of scenarios with just this set.</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>Due to the 2 unique parts and the demand for classic castle, this set is worth more now (inflation adjusted) than when it was first for sale.&nbsp; I&#39;m assuming it went for $15 or less in 1986 and would have been worth the money then.&nbsp; Average used sale price on bricklink is $47 so definitely a good buy back then and even worth a splurge now if you&#39;re a fan of classic castle.&nbsp; Taking a quick look on lego.com, I would certainly prefer this over several of the new sets in the $40-$50 range.</p>

"mediAFOL","2022-02-05T02:12:41.923Z","Another panelled wall","<p>The sister set to the&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/62959"">Blacksmith Shop</a>, Armor Shop also adds a significant red accent to its 1980s grey Castle palette. This time, however, it is more successful, the traditional roof tiles feeling more in character, possibly representing a canvas awning.</p>

<p><img alt=""Armor Shop"" src=""https://tom.chadw.in/assets/pics/Lego/armorShop.jpg"" style=""width: 726px; height: 477px;"" /></p>

<p>Again, though, the grey panels make this model fly up, so the build experience is again somewhat lacking. The round grey columns at each end are attractive, though, so the set is possibly slightly more appealing than its companion.</p>

<p>It&#39;s hard to tell whether my weapons-rack ennui is retrospective after opening both Castle and Kingdoms advent calendars this last year. While appropriate for this set, by definition, it&#39;s still a very commonplace addition, and does little to differentiate this set from others over the years.</p>
