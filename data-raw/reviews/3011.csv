"Novelty","2007-03-30T12:40:45.317Z","Resistance is Futile","This set tries to update the classic 6055 set, but it gets a few things mumbled up.  In an attempt to reduce the set size though, a few things are eliminated.  Gone is the carriage pulled by 4 horses, it has been replaced by just one white horse.  Gone is the mischievious merchant/peasant, in comes the forestman.  Gone is the small and cramped cell, the new version is roomy and airy with bars for doors.  Gone is the lockable door/ramp, the clip-shut doors (yes, that's two, one on each side) can easily be opened from the inside as the outside.

Compared to the set that this one is designed to replace, it is but a poor echo.  Sure there's a forestman, but even that can't offset the fact that the design of this set is poor when compared with 6055.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2008-01-02T15:37:59.153Z","Watch out! Robin will escape!","I think this set deserves four points. 6055 might be better - I don't have it myself - but this one is great as well. The only thing that I miss a bit is a locking mechanism for the doors with the bars. It's a bit simple in terms of style, but I don't mind. I played with it many hours when I was a child. 

You get one soldier, a knight and Robin Hood. Enough minifigs to start playing with. Robin escapes and the soldier and the knight are busy with finding him. If they don't, the furious king will throw them into the kingdom's worst prison cell. 

Two horses in different colours - wonderful - and the knight has one of those brilliant armors on. And no, there is not only one sword. The knight has a sword and another one is held by a blue plate with a clip at the carriage's back. A nice set, but the coachman should have either a sword or a shield. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"natro220","2009-11-06T23:12:20.093Z","Nice smaller castle set","I always thought this set was fun to play with.  It has a good variety of minifigs (a forestman, crusader, and knight), a horse, and a decent color scheme.  While it's obviously not as fun to play or build as a lot of the castles in the genre, it's a good addition to your medival world.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mngoult","2010-01-06T11:54:47.577Z","Odd colours but a solid set","A recent aquisition and generally very pleased with it. It has a good minifig compliment and two horses, the carriage is solid and the two doors are nicely detailed and hinge well.

The black whip is good and its nice to get another forestman, the white flag at the back is unnecessary and looks silly. The minifg on the horse comes complete with body armour which is good and serves as a personnal escort for the prison wagon. 

A good four stars as apart from the flag at the back theres nothing wrong with it.

Pros
Three minis and two horses.
Nice wagon opening system.

Cons
Flag at the back.
doors don't lock shut.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"wakproductions","2009-07-27T01:39:11.683Z","Pretty good medieval transport","I think you get pretty good value for the size of this set.  3 minifigs!  You get a Forestman, Crusader Knight, and an un-knighted Crusader mercenary to drive the coach.  As a prisoner transport, it gets the job done.  While some may complain it's not roomy enough, I have found that it can easily transport at least two.

One problem with this set is that some of them had a production error where the cage doors did not have the correct part shipped in the package.  The top part of the door did not have holes in the bottom, making it impossible to install the cross section that secures the bars in place.  Other than that, it's a cool set!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-18T16:50:00.363Z","Dungeon Hunters Review","<p>Of the different Castle theme Prison Wagons I've seen, this one is one of the better sets I've and have played with. I know that there's 6055, but that was just a couple years before I started collecting the Legoland sets. And the current set from Kingdoms for 2010 just has the appearance of being awful.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set though, has 3 minifigures and it ties together nicely the Lion Knights and Forestment sets. There is also 2 horses in this set. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have one Lion Knight who's driving the Prison Wagon that's being pulled by a single white horse. The main carriage that transport the prisoner is done fairly well too with two doors with bars on either side, a place in back where the prisoner's weapons are held. Then, acting as ready escort and protection is a second Lion Knight on a black horse who's wearing some of the (new then) plate armor and helmet with visor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you've got other Forestmen sets, you can play where they come rescue the prisoner. Othersets or just even by itself, theres some scenes you can do with capturing the prisoner, he escapes or taking him off to the dungeons.</p>",TRUE,4,3,4,4,5
"CamberbrickGreen","2012-02-06T05:02:44.773Z","Merry Man Gets Cagey","'Dungeon Hunters' ? Well its a prison wagon or prisoner transport with some very good parts and people but its not the best. The 'Crusaders' or updated Lion Knights seem intent to join the black falcons in hounding the forestmen. Traditionally in Robin Hood stories King Richard is away on the crusades and is supposed to be more sympathetic to the merry men's activities upon his return but not always and this is a kids play set so comparisons should end where imagination can improve.<div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Minifigures</b></div><h4><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b><b>[</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>Superb horse whip/ prisoner whip.</li><li>Brown forestman hat, bow and quiver of arrows.</li><li>Grey plate armour.</li></ul>The crusader knight stands out with a smart white flag on grey lance contrasting with the black horse and red saddle. The terrific grey armour plate and helmet with breathe-holes visor helmet is always amazing but the blue lion shield adds the right touch to make him one of the best variants available. The guard&nbsp;shield top is only reasonable if like me you are fussy.</div><div><br><div><b>The Blue Bus Is Calling Us</b></div><div>A really good selection of characters with decent parts but I don't want to keep this set. Even though its a good wagon shape and size, the axle and wheels look fine and the drivers in a good seat with the white horse positioned well i just find the older carriage type preferable with its four horses. In addition both sets contain the same thing that bothers me most: blue bricks.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>I accept that an all black and grey set would not be child marketed but why blue? For a wooden mediaeval vehicle I could take lines or small sections of colour but both blue end builds on top of a red plate floor just estranges it from the theme slightly.</div><div><br></div><div>Its still a good build outside of my colour whinging. Clips feature to hold two spears at the front to poke at the prisoner through the bars. The bars! There are interesting bits in this set too, the cage is finished with these wide bar sections and make it a bit like an animal transportation, you could expect to see the king's pet lion in there.&nbsp;Another flag of white flies on top and the iron railing doors are hinged well for loading and breaking out.&nbsp;</div><div><b><br></b></div><div><b>Jump On The Bandit Wagon</b></div><div>Plenty of fun to have with this set for kids, as timeless as many 1980's sets. Loads of action, good parts, MFs with a good build. Just a slightly odd wagon for colour and great if you want lots of carts but for choosing a favourite, have a good look around the range first.</div></div>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,3
"Ernst","2012-02-29T18:01:57.733Z","Dungeon Hunters : good set with strange colors.","<p>Overall&nbsp;3 bricks : A nice set but not very original, in fact it is a small version of set 6055 the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6055-1"">Prisoner Convoy</a>. But since that was a good set it has some logic. A good set with nice minifigures and a good addition to your Castle collection and not too expensive. Only odd thing is again the color blue, maybe it is Lego's referal to an early Policecar ? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 3 bricks : Not too difficult to built just keep focused because of all the small parts. The most ""difficult"" part are the 2 nice doors with bars. Finished a stable result with good steering thanks to the turntable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts 4 bricks : 3 Great minifigures are used, all three very regonizable (I esspecialy like the captured Forestman) with sufficient weapons and 2 horses. And overall great parts which are usefull in many ways like the bows, the antenna's, the whip, the inverted black slopes and black bars for the antenna's. Very usefull stuff overall. Again the blue color should have been brown or grey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playability 4 bricks : great ways to play with the single set. The forestman can simply escape or take over the carriage and defeat both the Crusader Knights. If you own other Forestman sets you can let them join.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 4 bricks : Bricklink offers an average of €16.45 for this set which is kind of ok. It is already 22 years old and offers both playing fun and nice parts. Crusaders is a relative small theme so for a collector it is defenitly worth the money.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,4,4
