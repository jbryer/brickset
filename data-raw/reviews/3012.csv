"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-27T12:14:12Z","Kool....","It was really neat looking, and the catapult fired respectably. The HUGE dragon head seems a little bit out of scale however, and I've never seen a medieval catapult that looks anything like this. A fun set for sieging castles, though.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-05-04T06:32:34.687Z","Do not judge a catapault by its figurehead","When I first saw this set, I went wow, it looks amazing.  It has this great dragon head in black with teeth and flames shooting out from it, a nice blue and red body with 4 wheels and 2 soldiers.  Then I bought the set and played with it and the catapault didn't work most of the time.  Not very good for a catapault that's suppose to fling bricks.  Like all other catapaults, it does need a harness for it to be hauled by a horse or ... a dragon - that would have made it so much cooler, but that's an opportunity missed.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2008-01-02T15:48:34.56Z","Bulky","This catapult is quite - how shall I say - bulky. And that imitation of a dragon head is quite exaggerated. But it works, which is the most important think when you buy a catapult. The dragon wings are also disturbing; not only for the eyes but also when you play with it. At least I think so. 

There are enough weapons for the minifigs: one spear, one lance, two shields, one sword and a huge axe. When the catapult is damaged by the enemey, they can still protect themselves by using the weapons as long as their enemies are not too numerous. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-10-09T23:14:02.67Z","Dragon Cannon","This is a very detailed and well designed set. I like the idea of the dragon's head being a cannon. The knights are pretty wicked with the dragon shields and don't want to be messed with just like me. The Dragon Defender is a dynamic set and deserves a 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-01-12T18:44:32.247Z","My oldest lego set","This is my oldest lego set, but no my first. It is very cool, to make castles, battles, and play with various minifigures using it. One of the best things in this set is the dragon's head. The minfigures, weapons, shields, and helmets are so cool too. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2008-05-20T19:57:42.047Z","works great","this set works great. the catapult gets locked into position by a little piece in the back and you push on the dragon head (if you let it fall the rocks wont fly far). and watch it go. the dragon head is a good sculpture and theshields and flags are cool. the alternate models on the back of the box are also good and the figures would push the catapult (people some times did back then actually). if you find it at a used sale buy it. it will eb worth your money.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"MPH","2009-04-16T13:06:22.75Z","A bit too blue...","A catapult seems to be almost a necessity in castle themes, but there is only so much variation you can have. This one in particular inherits a lot from 6039 (Twin Arm Launcher). Not to say that's a bad thing, because it was a great design with the two launch arms. Furthermore, the Dragon Defender is somewhat bigger, and therefore looks mightier. The dragon head, although still a bit oversized, fits in better than with 6082 and fortifies the impressive appearance of the vehicle.

What brings it down in my opinion, however, is the 'overusage' of blue. It makes the set look a bit childish and also out of place in the whole Dragon Knight theme (where blue is not very prominent). I'm not sure what would have been a better choice color-wise, but this just doesn't feel right - one point off for that.

Two minifigs is good for a set this size and the selection of weapons (two shields!) is perfect.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Batmaniam","2009-02-25T13:11:28.717Z","STORM THE CASTLE!!","I love this set. My brother got it, but then he moved out so now it is mine, all mine :) It works great too. You push down the head, and then the bricks go flying. It is great for sieges. I love castle, and I want to get back into it, but that means that I am going to have to take apart my town to get enough pieces. But great set. And the best thing is: IT IS MODELLED AFTER A DRAGON! You cannot beat that. It looks awsome. Lots of rare pieces, and with a little addition you can add horses to pull it. It has two minifigs one is just a normal soldier, but the other one is really cool, he looks like the general, or the king. Nice build. If you have more than one then you can have a big siege on the castle. Thats another thing, I need to make a castle. I think that I am going to make it so that all of the walls are made out of thos mountain pieces so that it looks like it was carved out of a mountain. Oh well. Great set, it is a classic. If you see it get it, part of Lego history (I think). ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"BasiltheBatlord","2009-02-15T21:02:16.623Z","Dragon assualt ","The order of dragon masters, led my the wizard Majisto, Is a very cool faction of lego castle. They were the first fantasy one. This set has two cool min figs, and an amazing fantasy catapault. You pull back the holding piece, and the wait of the dragon head launches four roks. The catapault is cool because it is modeled after a dragon. It is also aquped with weapon holders, and some weapons: A halberd, a spear, and a sword, as well as a dragon sheild. Great job, Lego!

"Huge_Nerd","2010-07-23T06:59:08.38Z","great to look at","This set looks amazing with its giant dragon head, dual catapults, and fun detailed minifigs. The design of the launching gimmick is actually pretty involved and impressive. The only downside is it didn't launch very far. The projectiles would barely make it past the dragons head so for play I would have to pretend to launch it. Overall though, this baby cast fear into the hearts of castle dwellers everywhere.<br>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
"Harmonious_Building","2012-06-18T11:10:41.177Z","Reptile reconnaissance. ","<p>Now here's a set that attempted to do something a little different, at least as far as the typical aesthetic of Castle siege weapons goes. The Dragon Knights as a whole opted for a very different and much more ""fantastic"" look, and Dragon Defender is pretty emblematic of that look as a whole. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Two Minifigs and 150 pieces in one compact package is a fairly good deal if you can find it for the suggested retail price of US$12 or so. You get one captain and one grunt to do the heavy lifting, and plenty of accessories for them both, so you're not likely to feel slighted by them. I should say that the Dragon Knight helmet is still one of the coolest helmets to ever grace the Castle line, and they&nbsp;are sufficiently detailed and unique that they still look good even compared to contemporary&nbsp;Castle helmets, though of course they&nbsp;don't have that semi-shiny gloss that <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Castle&amp;subtheme=Kingdoms"">Kingdoms</a> helmets have. In short, Dragon knights are&nbsp;sweet, and now we move on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of functionality,&nbsp;Dragon Defender works just about as well as you would expect it to. Eschewing the use of strings and&nbsp;any other fancy gimmicks,&nbsp;Dragon Defender is about as simple as catapults get: load up the two shovel-type pieces with grey bricks, give the head a hard push down, and away they go. There's not necessarily much logic in terms of how the Minifigs might be expected to launch the stone projectiles, but I figure that&nbsp;""logic"" plays no role when YOUR SIEGE MACHINE LOOKS LIKE A FRICKIN' DRAGON</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of how the set looks, I'll give credit here where credit is due: as mentioned before, no one can complain about this set being ""just another catapult"", and no other Castle siege machine is quite comparable. That being said, the execution is far from being perfect, and I realise that part of the reason why the dragon head especially looks the way it does is simply due to technical limitations of the time (that is, the lack of existence of pieces that would have certainly helped its appearances). I suppose its reasonably convincing for what it's trying to convey, and a further excuse could be made that the&nbsp;dragon head is not meant to be an actual dragon head but a carved representation of it. &nbsp;It works well for what it does, but I'm sure that rudimentary improvements could be made to it to make it look even better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Less forgiveable is the body of the catapult. Blue is just a poor choice for the body in my opinion. I don't know if brown was commonplace in the LEGO universe at the time, but a more ""realistic"" colour choice would have been my preference. Additionally, the spindly wagon wheels upon which the catapult sits are completely exposed; I realise that it would probably have upped the piece count considerably to protect them, but it sort of makes the whole design seem somewhat precarious. Then again, it is true that the Dragon Knights do tend to be fond of precarious designs. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This isn't the greatest of all Dragon Knights sets, but it is worth looking into if you feel like building a Dragon Knight army instead of interpreting them merely as dragon hunters/dragon tamers. While it doesn't look particularly great in my opinion, it does function well and does get points in my book for trying something fresh. </p>",TRUE,3,3,4,4,4
"Ernst","2013-05-05T12:55:10.903Z","Looks strange but nice, shoots unexpected good.","<p><strong>Overall 4 bricks</strong> : My first review of a Dragon Knights set, which theme I like because of the great looking Knights. The result, a red and blue, catapult in the shape of a dragon looks somewhat unrealistic but than can be expected considering the theme. Unexpected is how the catapult works, thanks to the way the weight is divided the catapult shoots great when released. That result and the 2 great looking Dragon Knights makes this set a great addition for Lego fans and Castle fans in particular. Add to that the price for which you can find it the 4 bricks are well deserved.</p>

<p><strong>Building 4 bricks</strong> : Building this set is nothing spectacular, a lot of small parts and plates make it fun to built. The special surprise is the design of the shooting mechanism with the double lever and the dragon head as counterweight which gives a surprisingly good result. Another good detail are the handle&#39;s on both sides to move the catapult.&nbsp;Therefore four bricks here too.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 4 bricks</strong> : Parts used are very good and useful in other creations although&nbsp;the red and blue&nbsp;are not the usual Castle colors. The present mini figures are awesome, both with different torso&#39;s, sufficient weapons and the great helmet decorations for the leading Knight.</p>

<p><strong>Playability&nbsp;4 bricks</strong> : A nice looking and great working catapult with 2 good looking and well equipped Knights are worth 4 bricks. With some mini figures from another faction it would have been 5. Since there is something to be desired I stick to 4 bricks here.</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks</strong> : The average price on <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=6043-1"">Bricklink</a> is, writing this, some &euro; 11,50 so there you earn 5 bricks. Hard to find a&nbsp;2012/2013 Castle set as well equiped and complete as this one for that money.</p>
