I really like how there is two horses pulling this, not just one, as is the case with many other castle wagons.  I didn't care for yet ANOTHER king, but hey, the three other knights make up for it.  Overall, this is just a great castle wagon.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-05-10T11:51:13.773Z","Kingdom Come","This chariot is huge.  Of course it's large enough to be fit for a king.  There is even enough room at the back for a chest.  Because of its size, it's pull by a team of two horses and is outfitted with at least 3 soldiers to guard the king.  The grandeur of the chariot falls apart though on closer observation of the chariot.  It seems to be random lego pieces thrown together to form the chariot.  Eventhough it tries to get it right with the pennant and the flag as steps down from the chariot thing, it still conveys that almost no thought went into the design to give it such a horrible look.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

There are 4 minifigs in total including the king. This is a pretty good way to make a royal army with the 3 knight minifigs. The set overall is a nice piece of work. 5 out of 5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Harmonious_Building","2011-12-05T21:36:36.367Z","His Majesty gets carried away.","<div>I only bought this set relatively recently - that is, a number of years after it was actually released and during those heady college days in which I decided to buy a bit of LEGO every now and then in between bouts overworking myself due to taking 21 credit hours per semester in addition to working a part-time job, but perhaps none of that is important right now - as a means of complementing the Royal Knights’ Castle (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6090-1"">6090</a>), since, after all, what good is a castle if a king has no means of getting to and from it?&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Carriages have been a staple of the Castle line for ever long, so the inclusion of one with the Royal Knights came as a surprise to no one, really, but I have no older set to compare it to, since the only other carriage I own is the one from King’s Carriage Ambush (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7188-1"">7188</a>), and the difference in years there is almost too large for a sensible comparison to be made (although I did so anyway in my review of the aforementioned set). When I look at a set nowadays, what I tend to do is consider the set’s overall coherence with the theme that it is supposed to be in, in addition to the other usual aspects of aesthetics and buildability. Where King’s Carriage really succeeds is in its relation to the other elements of the Royal Knights line, especially with regards to the castle. I say this because the carriage and the castle have been designed such that the carriage, which is roughly six studs wide or so, can pass beneath either of the castle’s gates. And although you may not find yourself necessarily performing that motion, what it means is that King’s Carriage scales perfectly with the castle, which is something that cannot be said about 7188 with regards to King’s Castle (<a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=7949-1"">7949</a>), its alleged home base.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Another boon to King’s Carriage is that it comes with four Minifigs, which is quite a large amount for a set of this size. Not only does one get a (somewhat coveted) king Minifig, but a driver and two bodyguards as well. This goes a long way in terms of building a classic army, especially since it’s pretty hard to justify having two bodyguards travelling with him - there’s hardly any space for one of them to stand.</div><div><br></div><div>Which brings us thus to the subject of the carriage itself. I’ve always liked the spinny-piece thing construction that allows the horses to turn the carriage, but, other than that, King’s Carriage looks like a spindly piece of work that is hardly befitting of royalty, save for the lovely chrome swords that adorn the sides. As a medieval setpiece, King’s Carriage leaves a lot to be desired. And the blue and yellow colour scheme - really? Wouldn’t red and white with a dash of yellow have been more suitable? One could make an argument that the blue construction is meant to match up with the roof tiles of the Royal Knights’ Castle, but then again, I have serious objections to those, too.</div><div><br></div><div>And thus we arrive at the inherent contradiction present in all LEGO medieval carriages. I want them to be able to scale with the castles that they accompany, but I can’t stand it when they look as fragile as King’s Carriage does. The city vehicles don’t really seem to have this problem, but there’s just something about carriages that never feels right. As far as carriages goes, however, you’ll eventually warm up to King’s Carriage if you already have other Royal Knights sets to serve as its backdrop, but, unlike many other Castle sets, I find that it’s a bit hard to love.&nbsp;</div>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,5

	<span style="""">A King&rsquo;s got to have a way to move around in luxury and he&rsquo;s also got to be protected so on the fact that the set is carriage and that it contains a generous number of bodyguards (even if they are crusaders in disguise) the set wins points, I also an a huge fan of the cloth pennant, the two horses and the accessories (goblet and treasure for example).<span style=""mso-spacerun:yes"">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<span style="""">However the carriage itself is a rather gaudy and blocky, its scale is also off with that of the castle and the blue, yellow, black colour scheme is horrible. It&rsquo;s a real shame because I love everything about the set when you look at what it contains, but I just don&rsquo;t like the build, this is a good example of how designs will always beat gimmick (which is why LEGO will always come out on top over Mega Blocks, P.S sorry for swearing).</span></p>
