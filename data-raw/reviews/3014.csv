If you read my reveiw of Sanghai Suprise, I meant the new Ninja castles, not the first KK castles, those were horrible sets and should have never been released for purchase anywhere.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-11T02:41:58.577Z","Solid 4 almost a 5 - Great set","I have had this set since it came out. I like the trap if you try to steal the gems. You get three ninja's in this set all all for 12.00 at the time. This set was a bargin and has alot of playability. The flying ninja building is a little tricky.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-07-16T08:37:14.607Z","Dojo","Firstly the glider with the raft as the backpack doesn't look too bad in this set, if only because the wings are bigger.  In fact, it seems about correct for that wingspan.  The shrine is neatly designed and constructed, giving it a carved out of the hill look.  The Koi on the sides gives it an interesting architectural detail.  However, the interior of the shrine is shabilly designed - better parts could have been used instead of the cups and the round table-thing.  The falling axe is interesting and is neatly integrated into the design.  Overall, it looks good, has a nice design feature and feels very well constructed.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"lolerkiller","2007-10-14T08:40:18.53Z","Very cool set","This is an very cool set i did get it in an birthday presant from my parents many years ago i was very happy and i begun building it as soon as the birthday was finished it was soo cool. and i used it many times untill it did fell down into the floor.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2008-06-16T19:19:29.297Z","awesome glider!","i got this set a while ago and i love it. what got my attention was the glider. only big sets have it except this one. the glider is in perfect proportions and doesnt feel like the wings are too big or too small. the fort is also cool. its got an axe that falls down and it looks like it was carved out of a rock. there are koi statues which are like on real japanese houses. the gem well... i have lots of them. the figures are cool because you get 3. and its where i put the figures from my ninja knights set. great set 10/10",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"WiseWarrior","2008-10-31T19:33:31.14Z","Small and deadly","This reminds me of Spider's Secret, another awesome set that is sort of similar to this one. Both have treasures hidden inside the little mountain, and they are both guarded by cool traps. I like this one better however, because not only does it have a falling axe, but it has a ninja with wings, which are always cool, and some crazy looking bandits.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-06-07T11:31:47.233Z","LEGO Castle (Ninja) - Ninja Surprise Review","This set is small but it was a fun built. This model includes 3 minifigs. We get a black ninja, the ninja swordsman and a robber with the eye-patch. This set comes with a glider for the black ninja which has some cool fins.<br><br>The cave is also not that hard to put together. A good thing about this cave is that you don't have to put on stickers. We get some nice flags. There're two smaller ones and a bigger one. I also like the fish statue pieces. I've only seen these pieces in the LEGO Castle (Ninja) theme but now I've seen them in the 2011 LEGO Atlantis set 'City of Atlantis' which is set 7985. What I also like about that cave that this cave has a trap when you want to get the gem in the inside. The trap is the falling axe. I think it's a nice set to have.<br><br>All
in all this set is a grood model and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"AETerry","2011-01-21T01:30:02.26Z","Ninja Surprise Review","<p>While I love the Castle Oriental or Ninja theme it did back in the 90's, there weren't very many sets that stood out as something I wanted to pick up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set is obviously one of the sets I picked up. Mainly for the black ninja and his glider he's using to swoop in on the bandits at the shrine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The glider is a bit chunky with the way it's built, but the wings on it make it more then appropriate it should be like that. Aside from the Ninja, there's two bandits either guarding the treasure or trying to figure out how to steal it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's not a bad little set with some of the newly introduced gem pieces for it's time and little features such as the falling axe trap. There's plenty of the new Oriental flags, it over all makes for a fun little set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,4
"Fauch","2014-11-30T19:53:12.583Z","classic ninja set","<p>Just like another reviewer, I think it is quite similar to spider&#39;s secret adventurers set from 1999, though unlike him, I would say spider secret is a bit better, it has better parts, but bit&nbsp;less good minifigs.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Not sure there is much in this set, except flags and wings/sails. It was pretty exciting when it came out in 1998, but a lot of the pieces that were new back then seem very common now (it was so cool to get katanas) also it comes with a triangular mountain piece, which I think&nbsp;are more commonly found in bigger sets.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Then again, it&#39;s nothing too special, it was ok for 1998, but compared to modern minifigs, they lack backprinting, though the black ninja still looks cool. It is nice that you can attach something to the samurai helmet or on the back of the ninja.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Not sure what to say, it is probably as simple as it looks. I&#39;m not a huge fan of the leaf pieces, you should be cautious, they break easily.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Well, it&#39;s pretty cool, you have a small treasure caches that doubles as an outpost, with a trap inside. With 3 minifigs and a glider there is quite a bit of play value. From what I remember it is quite hard to play inside the cache, you can&#39;t really grab the jewel without breaking its support.</p>
