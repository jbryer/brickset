"Slobrojoe","2020-07-31T09:10:07.11Z","A superb addition to a superb magazine series!","<p>The Blocks magazines have only recently been added to Brickset&#39;s database and one of the goals of this review is to highlight that and make people more aware of this amazing magazine series. This is my and the first Blocks magazine review on Brickset and I hope you enjoy it. This is issue 40 and was released in February 2018 for &pound;4.99 in the UK.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i><u>Reviews</u></i></b></p>

<p>One of the main features that Blocks specialises in is reviews. This issue contains 3, which is sub-par compared to the other issues. The set is judged on minifigures, price, build and playability just to name a few, resulting in a score out of 100.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first is 70922 The Joker Manor with 3444 pieces, 10 minifigures and costing &pound;249.99 or $/&euro;269.99. Based on the LEGO Batman Movie, the review focuses on the vast amount of play features and stickers found throughout the build.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next is 10259 Winter Village Train Station with 902 pieces, 5 minifigures and costing &pound;74.99 or $79.99 or &euro;69.99. The review features some very nice statistics like &#39;10259 is the 10th minifigure scale train station produced by the LEGO Group (as of date published)&#39;.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last review is 75192 Millennium Falcon (UCS) with 7541 pieces, 8 minifigures (not including porgs or dianogo) and costing &pound;649.99 or $/&euro;799.99. It provides in-depth pictures of each stage of the finished model but highlights the size and, not lack of playability, but the fact that it is difficult to play with and not knock off a dozen pieces. It also shows some of the rooms left almost bare, encouraging mods (more on that later).&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i><u>Build and modding</u></i></b></p>

<p>Another good feature of Blocks&#39; is the help when you are looking for ways to improve a build. Blocks has the answer! From castle bookshelves to Ninja restaurants and&nbsp;actually improving an official models&#39; aesthetics. There are three building articles in this issue.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first build article is &#39;Destiny&#39;s Bounty: The Modular Part 1&#39;. This follows the idea and designs of Steve Guinness to improve his building skills. To do this, he would need to create alternative builds from an official LEGO set. He chose 70618 Destiny&#39;s Bounty from 2017 and decided to make a modular building starting with Wu&#39;s shop on the first floor.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The next build article is a Steampunk Batman Mech. The clue is in the name really. Not much else to say.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>The last build article is a mod. This highlights 75192 Millennium Falcon&#39;s interior space. It is Part 1 of a series spread across issues. This part focuses on the crew quarters and shows an almost step-by-step guide on how to build 3 beds in the on-screen style, a swivel chair and a feature control wall.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i><u>Videogame</u></i></b></p>

<p>Many issues cover a video game and this is no exception. This time, it is LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2. It shows some scenes from the video game and how it performs compared to the last one.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><b><i><u>Other features</u></i></b></p>

<p>-Minifigure of the Month</p>

<p>-Modular Makeover (diner modular)&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Bricksy inspirations (Banksy and LEGO)&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Top Ten LEGO Failures&nbsp;</p>

<p>-An unusual LEGO keyring obsession...</p>

<p>-And much more!<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I recommend this issue to Star Wars fans (the Millennium Falcon), City fans (Winter Village) and DC fans (steampunk batman and the Joker Manor).</p>

<p><br />
I hope this review gave you some insight of what you get in a Blocks magazine issue. You can order past issues in digital form or find recent ones on the Blocks website blocksmag.com. The aim was to give you some information but leave you itching for more and I hope I succeeded. Please be aware that Blocks is a British establishment and it costs a lot more per issue anywhere else in the world, particularly the US. Thanks for reading and please support future Blocks issues to keep the magazine going!</p>
