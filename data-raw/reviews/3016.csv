Especially Keith Hornsby XL, how can you give this set a 2 because the prisoner is ugly! This is an awesome set and sometimes people have to be ugly in order to give the theme of the set!!!! Sheeeeesh! 2/10 is what you give sets with nothing in them or things that simply fall apart, which this is none of that!!!!!!! Give some more thought to your reviews man!@#%^  Anyway, this was and still is my favorite set and I simply loved it, making prisoner captures and taking them back to the big castles, all classic! I really loved this set, I dont get why other people dont know what a good and imaginative set is, sheeeesh! Review with common sense next time.............!!!!

Also, when i got mine, it included a special plastic cave thingy which could have the lego men stand on it. Overall, this set rocks.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Laoakai","2006-05-09T09:18:51Z","Very nice","I got this set when I was 10. And we were in a 2 week holiday at the sea. (not the sunny south, but the a bit more colder northsea). Well I didnt bring myself much to play, but then we went into a toystore and I got myself this set.(It was all I could afford that time) And well I have to say I spend all my time when I was bored playing with only this set and it never got boring, Well of course I had a very good imagination and used the living room furniture as rocks/mountains or caves. Great set overall!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"icelus","2008-04-16T22:47:38.997Z","Interesting, yet awkward","Overall, this is a pretty neat set.  The fire and wing accents are a nice touch, as is the concept of the dragon as the beast of burden.  More kudos to the bat king guy.  

That being said, there are some things that just seem awkward.  Not so much in a artistic sort of way, but rather in a functional way.  For instance, on the top of the &quot;backdoor&quot; are two angled bricks.  LEGO should have provided one of those 2x1 flat-top pieces to smooth this out and add a bit of stability.  Same goes with the tiered bricks beside the driver's seat.

I got this set on eBay at a good price, and I would certainly recommend picking up a set if it's priced reasonably.  It makes a nice addition to any castle collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-15T12:49:28.97Z","LEGO Castle (Fright Knights) - Traitor Transport Review","This set is not my favourite set but it's a good set for pieces and minifigs. This model is very sturdy and a an easy built and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. We also get a horse with an armor and a dragon. The minifig value is okay, too. We get the bat lord with his black bat helmet, the cape with the bat on the back and the red armor. The other minifig has a black helmet, a gray armor and black hair. The last character is supposed to be the prisoner in this scene. He has the black helmet with the white plume, the red armor and blue legs.<br><br>The set itself doesn't have many play features. You can remove the jail from the big wagon and you can get the prisoner in if you open the door in the back. The black fins are movable and the wagon is towed by the dragon and it can maneuver very well. As I told you: We don't get many play features. I think this set is an okay set. I think this set is good if you want some more minifigs and some pieces for future MOC's (My own creations) or some future brick films.<br><br>All
in all this set is an okay set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
