"brickzone","2007-03-20T14:19:43.64Z","Knightce set!","This is a good castle set, well stocked with knights and with a simple design that creates a good impression of a little troop transport longboat.

For all the small size of the set, it has *five* knights. There's also a treasure chest, five shields, three lances, an axe and more spears than you can shake a stick at. The design is clever with the spears doubling as oars, but it is a bit rough and ready due to its age so I've given 4 rather than 5 stars; note the dragon head/tail on the boat are nicely done, but blocky nevertheless.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-04-07T02:25:16.71Z","Arrrrrrr marda!","This is a slightly larger version of 6017 and is equipped chok-a-bric with goodies.  A treasure chest with some yellow cups sits in the bow and there are 2 shields at the stern.  The set comes with 5 minifigs, and a total of 8 spears and 2 lances.  The spears, of course, were used as paddles as this was before the advent of the Pirates line with specialised paddle pieces.  The craft is topped by 4 pennants.  Asthetically it looks good and the simple design does not detract from the final form.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-10-12T13:22:21.013Z","Half an army","This set comes with five soldiers, eight spears, five shields and one axe. By buying this set you will get a little army. The spears look nice as rudders. Pirates with their paddles were not available when this set was launched. For this boat I find the spears better anyway. 

You also get a treasure chest in which you can put a yellow goblet and a yellow round plate (format 1x1). So you already have some gold on board. Take care of it and don't let the enemies steal it from you! 

My only criticism is that the end of the boat with the two inverted slope bricks falls off easily. Apart from that minor flaw I can only recommend it. It is a great set indeed!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-11T10:11:58.577Z","Another boat","Another boat of the same subtheme, from the lion knights, this that features five of these minifigures. The differences of the minifigures are few, like the helmets or the weapons, turning this set an army builder. The color scheme looks like be the same of the set King's oarsmen, but have another colors in the bigger parts in the front and back of the set. The rails are also included, these keeps the minifigures inside the boat and the spears of these in the side of the boat. White hose pieces are included, and makes a cool form to keeps weapons or armors inside it. Flags and three spears of jousts are included, four different colors of flags. Ramp pieces compatible under plates are the base, along with other normal lego bricks, all these in the same red color. The base can't makes this set floats, but the playability still great floating or don't. It due to the contents of minifigures, additions and the useful pieces to make buildings. This is an army builder, and is easy to play with, don't a big set, being a 5/5 set. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-14T15:39:28.193Z","Viking Voyager Review","<p>I remember at the time that I got this set, thinking it was a great idea and that LEGO should do a full theme devoted to actual Viking Warriors and sets. Something that LEGO has indeed done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other thing I remember is that I mainly grabbed up this set for the price and all of the new lion knight minifigures in it. Five minifigures in all, five shields, a load of spears, many of which are used as oars, battle axe and chest of treasure.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The design was/is good with the use of spears for oars and a crew readilly armed once they hit the shores to attack either the Black Falcons or Dragon Knights. The set just ultimately isn't one of my favorites and gotten only to be collecting up everything from Castle and Lego that could get.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,4
"T79","2014-10-15T13:17:45.24Z","""Build me an army worthy of... the Lion Knights""","<p>So, the Viking Voyager. Also known as the Lion Knight&#39;s one-set army, this set is for men-at-arms what #6055 Prisoner Convoy is for horses. Probably one of the regular sets with the best minifig-per-piece ratio: not even totalling&nbsp;100 pieces this set includes five minifigures!</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>The instructions demonstrate that this really isn&#39;t a big set: a small, double-sided sheet with 13 steps is enough to build this boat. And no, as you&#39;ll see later this doesn&#39;t mean that there&#39;s almost ten pieces per step. I no longer have the box but I seem to remember there was a picture of the boat as an almost&nbsp;black silhouette which I always found striking.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Honestly, the boat is just filler: almost 100 parts in this set but only half of them are for the boat, the rest is for the minifigures and their equipment. The only rare part seems to be the yellow 1 x 4 plate offset used for the ship&#39;s figurehead, but the main draw here are the several inverted wedges for the boat hull, our only&nbsp;ones in red. Whenever we needed a red jet or space fighter we knew where to go!&nbsp;I always thought the white hoses were&nbsp;a bit weird, they seem to serve the same function as the black hoses in #6016 Knight&#39;s Arsenal but they didn&#39;t convince me there either. They could come in handy for your spaceship though.&nbsp;:)</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>So if the boat&#39;s pieces aren&#39;t really special why the high score for parts then? As said before, five minifigures in one small set helps a lot in this regard. What separates this further from a standard minifigure set (with six minifigs) is the load of equipment they come with: one treasure chest, three lances with four pennants (of different colours), an axe, a goblet and finally five(!) shields and eight(!) spears! Oars weren&#39;t around yet so the spears filled in for that role, and actually they do look a lot nicer here than the oar parts would. So five&nbsp;minifigures with&nbsp;one shield and two weapons per soldier,&nbsp;if this didn&#39;t get your army started nothing would!</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>At the time we had two knight boats, this one and&nbsp;#6017 King&#39;s Oarsmen which was a lot smaller. Both are built more or less the same way, inverted wedges form the hull with then some plates and fences added, plus some more bricks for the bow and keel. Not much more to add here, it&#39;s rather straightforward. The figureheads (both fore and aft) are a bit fragile and&nbsp;get knocked off&nbsp;easily, but then they&#39;re easily fixed again. Despite being really simple they do add some much needed character though.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>For so few pieces&nbsp;used in&nbsp;the boat it&#39;s really not too bad, my only complaint is that for five minifigures it is positively cramped. It should have been a bit bigger, but how that should have been done with the then available pieces without making it <em>too</em> big is another question. Of course it&#39;s not a viking longship without a sail, but then we didn&#39;t really see any vikings in these minifigures either, just some lion knights with slightly off colours: a blue-and-white flag (loot from a raid on the Black Falcons?) or&nbsp;a black helmet with neck protector (idem) did not fit in with the rest of them.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Although the boat itself isn&#39;t that bad all considered, in the end there wasn&#39;t really happening much on water in the lego castle times of yore so usually the soldiers were requisitioned by the infantry while the parts were used in flying - modern or sci-fi - contraptions. It was only&nbsp;some years later that we did have several castle sets with water and some more boats and that is when this set started to be used a lot more. Even then though, the hassle of seating those three rowers each with two spears to be lowered through those black fences on the side made sure that once it was manned it usually stayed that way for a while. That said, it still is a rather nice set even if only for the army and parts included.</p>
