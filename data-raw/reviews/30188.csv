"Struhadlo","2020-08-06T22:38:19.277Z","Stop makings other sets look bad, or don't","<p>It comes as no surprise that what is probably the most fan demanded set ever is a total bestseller and is pretty difficult to hunt down in these early days after its release. As with everything somewhat special there is a controversy surrounding this very set, let me explain.&nbsp;Some people are angry that there was a huge social media fuss demanding this set and I can agree that this might occur as wee bit annoying to some, but you are not forced to watch any videos and read comment section on Instagram under the posts of a huge corporate which is probably a sign of you having way too much free time at your disposal. The second part of the controversy is that very similar group of people belive Lego has been bullied into making this set and thus they complain. Nothing could be more stupid honestly. Lego as every brand or company should listen to their fans if they want to make profit. If fans tell them to make a set which will sell incredibly well,&nbsp;it would be foolish not to create such set. Same case is when bands perform fan favourite tracks live. They know what people want to listen to and what will bring in the biggest crowd and thusly the biggest profit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Furthermore, this is not a Battle Pack and I will not judge it is as such. Why you may ask? It is not a 15 dollars set with four minifigs and most importantly the set is not called a Battle Pack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is a fantastic army builder, but not every army builder is a Battle Pack, even though every Battle Pack should be one despite recent years proving this statement completely false.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>PRICE</strong></p>

<p>This has to be one of the most fairly priced $30 sets ever from a licenced line of sets. Two fantastic vehicles, four clone troopers and two battle droids make this an awesome package which definitely pays off. I honestly yet have to meet a person who would claim that this is not a well-priced set.</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>

<p>I am blown away by how much Lego went above and beyond Call of Duty here. Not only did they include four regular minifig Clone Troopers here one of which is a brilliant Jet Trooper, but they also changed the angry clone face and as a sweet sweet cherry on top they included two Battle Droids.</p>

<ul>
	<li>501st&nbsp;Legion Clone Trooper. A state-of-the-art Lego Clone Trooper and nothing less. These bad boys come with the best and the most detailed chest print yet for a Clone Trooper with equally detailed back print. Legs do have a wee bit more simplistic print, but they come with a toe printing and that is rad. The helmet is as beautiful as ever but has a grey shadow imitation on the cheeks which may throw some people off. And as already mentioned there is a new head print with darker and more accurate skin tone and no more angry clone face. The only possible improvement I see right now is an arm printing.&nbsp;</li>
	<li>501st Legion Jet Clone Trooper. The Jet Trooper has&nbsp;the same legs as the regular 501st Trooper, but comes with a pair of blue arms, different chest and back print and a different helmet. The cheek &ldquo;shadows&rdquo; are of a regular blue this time and the pattern at the top of the helmet is little different. There is also a red mark at the forehead. As for the armour, there is a different blue pattern in the upper area of the chest and some blue at the otherwise same back print, which is covered by a blue jetpack.&nbsp;All of this make for even more detailed minifig.</li>
	<li>Battle Droid. A regular Battle Droid with nothing new or changed to my knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<p>Everyone here is armed with a regular mid size blaster in a black colour except for one Clone Trooper who will be armed with a long rifle blaster extended by a black candle piece. The BARC speeder&nbsp;also carries two more mid size blasters with lightsaber hilts as extensions on the barrel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>Or rather builds in this case. The set has two pretty awesome vehicles.</p>

<p>The BARC speeder is an incredible build and a lot of fun to complete. New building techniques are introduced here with the handlebars and other small areas on the speeder. For the detailing purposes there are 4 stickers and two of those are pretty difficult to apply, so take care here. You can seat one minifig as a driver in this vehicle at the front there are two stud shooters whose removal will not alter the look significantly. As already said previously, the back area provides two handles for blasters and two are standardly attached. There are no major drawbacks to this build as it is fairly simplistic and straight forward with its design. One small trouble is when the pilot holds the handlebars in his hands and you unplug him recklessly, the handlebars might remain the pilot&#39;s hands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>AT-RT is going to be compared to the one from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75261-1/Clone-Scout-Walker-%E2%80%93-20th-Anniversary-Edition"" target=""_blank"">75261</a>&nbsp;and in my humble opinion this one is the&nbsp;better of the two. It is smaller and thus feels less awkward. The building technique in few areas is vastly improved and the colour scheme as much as I know is subjective feels better and more outgoing if you will. Legs do have fewer parts used and from the front they look little thin. The front of the seating area looks pretty sharp and is very well detailed with a heavy abuse of stickers. Now I say abuse since applying so many stickers is a great cause of pain inducing headaches to me as I am utterly unable to place at least two of them correctly. The improved part&nbsp;are the handlebars as they do NOT get unattached every time you plug out the piloting Trooper. The back Area has shortened the antennas and there are two handles at the back for binoculars or weaponry. The front shield wings can be moved in a wide angle and the upper middle shield can be slightly moved too. The stud shooter has a huge range of motion here. The antennas at the back can be moved in roughly&nbsp;200-degree angle. The legs are posable mostly in a backwards fashion and thusly the walking cannot be simulated here. The regular standing position is the furtherest to the front&nbsp;the legs can get.&nbsp;One demerit the vehicle has according to same is the stud shooter at the front without any simulation of the long barrelled anti-personal cannon. I do not mind this and honestly the stud shooter looks better than a long barrel to me as the model is fairly smaller than the previous incarnation. The walker can be manned by one minifig. This model has seven stickers, and they are mostly an easy apply to a person blessed with a regularly working brain unlike me.</p>

<p>The front of the BARC speeder is a new piece I believe, but other than that this set bring no more new pieces except for the ones in the minifig category I believe. The parts used here are pretty regular and there is nothing too special I would say. Oh yes, the candle at the front of the rifle is probably a rare sight in the Star Wars line as is an actually good army building set.</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>I believe that there is a lot of fun to be had with this set. Since there are two whole vehicles with well-incorporated stud shooters and a lot of minifigs from two sides of the conflict. Kids can reenact any battle they want. You do not need to purchase any other sets to make the experience complete as this set works perfectly well on its own. Of course if you want to make the battle even bigger you can get the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75283-1/Armored-Assault-Tank-(AAT)"" target=""_blank"">75283</a>&nbsp;and make the droid side much stronger.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>This is the set which will go down in history as one of the better ones. A fantastic value,&nbsp;brilliantly detailed minifigs and vehicles, a lot of playability and the set can work as a display piece too since the builds are very well finished and the colour scheme is just such an eye-candy. Do I recommend you getting one? Yes! Get one, two or twenty. This works perfectly as a stand-alone set and when massed as there are no named characters. Army building perfection.</p>

<p>Thank you, Ryan and all the fans for making this possible and thank you, Lego, for listening to your fans. This set leaves a very sweet taste in my mouth and is one of the merrier things in this difficult year.</p>

"Bogdan501st","2020-08-11T13:17:48.3Z","This is so cool!!","<p>I didn&#39;t watch the Clone Wars. I like the prequels, but I prefer the originals. That means I&#39;ve only seen the 501st in Revenge of the Sith. Still, I find this set to be fantastic!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Builds</strong></p>

<p>I&nbsp;was surprised by&nbsp;the size and complexity of both builds. The box and the price pointed towards small vehicles, but that&#39;s not the case.</p>

<p><br />
The BARC speeder is simply huge and very bulky, while still maintaining a sleek look. I love the design used in the front and the chair, alongside the handle bars. My only complaint with the speeder would be that there is no clip for the blaster of the driver. Anyway, that&#39;s no big deal. Oh, also, be careful when placing the stickers in the back :)</p>

<p>The AT-RT looks great. I love the mechanical detailing on the side, as well as the combination of brick-built and sticker decorations on the legs, which are posable by the way. The main section has those fins in the front, so you can adjust the overall size of it.&nbsp; The stud shooter in the front is a cool inclusion and it doesn&#39;t stand out. Also, it&#39;s on a Mixel ball joint so it has a great range of motion. The clone has a lot of space behind the panels and in the back you can see two antennas, as well as two clips, one of which is holding a pair of Thermal Binoculars. That means you can store the pilot&#39;s blaster this time!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, the main selling point of the set.</p>

<p>Three classic 501st Clones is very generous. Their design is fantastic and I like the new clone face. My only complaint would be their all-white arms. LEGO could have included some blue accents... Anyway, overall they look great! LEGO has done a really good job this time.</p>

<p>The Jet trooper is really nice. I may like his design a little more, maybe because of the blue arms and the more detailed helmet. It is also nice to get the jetpack piece in blue.</p>

<p>Two B1 battle droids are welcome, but it&#39;s high time LEGO improved their design. Still, good for army building.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I love this set. It isn&#39;t very expensive and it is a great army builder, though not listed as a battle pack. Huge thanks to MandRproductions for making this happen ;). I hope LEGO will do more of these in the future, with different Clone Legions or Imperial divisions.</p>

"Vicious","2020-09-05T21:10:21.877Z","A Great Set, and a Dismal Precedent","<p><strong>*Disclaimer: I do not think Lego plans to abolish ~$15&nbsp;USD battle packs in the future, though I&#39;m aware of the rumors.&nbsp; This has not impacted my opinion of the set*</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; With the conception of this set finally coming into fruition, I was undoubtedly happy.&nbsp; The builds are average for modern system Star Wars, and the revival of the 501st troopers themselves is quite satisfactory.&nbsp; The centered placement&nbsp;of the helmet prints is far better than their older animated counterparts(despite the recurring issues with modern minifigure prints).&nbsp; The PPP is excellent for a Star Wars set, and the amount of figures for the price point is great, when compared to other recent sets in this theme.&nbsp; Most will find they get what they pay for, if not more.&nbsp; This set is great for&nbsp;children, and that is what is most important in the grand scope of things.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; However, the greatest flaw of the set is the premise of the set itself.&nbsp; Besides&nbsp;75037-1 , this is one of the first Star Wars &quot;battle packs&quot; to not be marketed as such.&nbsp; I find it rather petty to release the most demanded battle pack ever at a price point that is twice the price of a &ldquo;normal&rdquo; battle pack.&nbsp; <em>From an army-building point of view, the consumer is paying twice the price of a &ldquo;battle pack&rdquo; for an additional 2(two) battle droids.</em>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Lego made this set whilst being fully aware that many consumers would be willing to pay twice the MSRP of preceding army building sets, effectively doubling their profits.&nbsp; It is abundantly clear that they can get away with this when considering that the people who have the budget to build an army aren&#39;t children with rather limited incomes.&nbsp; And, seeing how this set has flown off of shelves, and people are continuing to amass their armies, LEGO knows that they can get away with this, assuming the troopers in question are desirable enough.&nbsp; It seems blatantly tone-deaf, when looking at many recent battle packs that feature unique, one-of characters.&nbsp; I have enjoyed many of those sets (75267, 75198, and 75167), but also wouldn&#39;t have minded if they had a larger build and were $30 USD, with&nbsp;the real estate given to a set with figures that one would want to army build.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With all that being said, those who lamented the (what some would consider obnoxious) campaigning for a 501st legion battle pack ought to rest easily, knowing that Lego didn&#39;t give them what they truly wanted.&nbsp; I am worried of the response from Lego to this set&#39;s sales figures, and if they will choose to place the army-building figures in higher price-point sets and place unique or undesirable characters in battle packs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"DG17R","2020-08-13T21:06:13.853Z","Worth the hype","<p>Finally a set to get the ever elusive 501st Trooper. I am thrilled with this set, the builds are great but the main reason to buy this is the mini figures! 3 501st Clones, 1 Jet Trooper and 2 Droids makes this set worth the $30 (USD) price tag. I would recommend getting this set before it retires because it will most likely cost $100 (USD) + on the after market after it retires.</p>

"HandPositions","2020-08-31T00:03:23.343Z","Doesn't Need to be a Battle Pack","<p>LEGO set number 75280, 501st Legion Clone Troopers, is a $30 army - building set with 285 pieces, six figures, and two main builds. When this set was released, I welcomed it with open arms. Unlike battle packs, this set is $30, but is well worth it, considering its potential as a playset and, as it is more likely to be used, when bought in multiples, an army - builder.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
501st Legion Clone Troopers contains six figures, four of which are 501st Legion trooper minifigures. The standard 501st trooper included in this set is outstanding. It has printings on both feet, along with a white belt or &quot;thigh&quot; piece, which has normally been found in black on clone troopers. The updated printing on the torso and legs looks great on these troopers. The helmet has a printing on the cheeks creating a shadow effect, along with blue marking, which continue on the torso. The heads used in all of the clones are the newer clone face, matching the live - action clones more than the ones seen in The Clone Wars. The 501st Jet Trooper has the same legs and head as the other troopers, but has a different torso printing, which revolves to the back, although the back of the torso element is not visible under the blue jetpack element. The helmet on this minifigure is similar to the others, except the cheek shadows are blue, and there are red markings as well. The blue on his helmet is different from that of the other three. Two standard clones, along with the jet trooper, have standard blasters. A fourth weapon included is a blaster rifle extended by a black candle element. The final figures included are B-1 Battle Droids, which have a slightly changed foot element, although the only difference I see is very small. They also carry blaster elements.<br />
<br />
The first of the two vehicles in this set is a BARC speeder, which is longer than a LEGO BARC speeder normally appears. It is very sleek, and cleverly uses a snowshoe element, which has been seen in previous renditions of the vehicle. It has few stickers compared to the AT-RT also included in the set. The side - mounted stud shooters on the front are understandable as a play feature. There is perfect space for a clone trooper to drive the speeder, and the handlebars are very maneuverable. There are blasters mounted on the sides as cannons, and there is ventilation underneath. Overall, the BARC speeder is phenomenal.<br />
<br />
The AT-RT model is the second and final vehicle in the set. It is built on a sturdy base, which the legs branch off of. The leg hinge elements contain stickers that were tedious to apply, but they end up looking wonderful. The feet at the bottom of the model are built well, but have a small range of motion. The cockpit of the walker has space for a minifigure, and use a clever stacking and locking technique that allows the minifigure to be detached without interfering with the handlebars. The antennae at the rear of the build look great, and there are clips at the back to attach accessories. The stud shooter at the front could have been mounted to a longer barrel, as seen in the 20th Anniversary Clone Scout Walker, but with that aside, the AT-RT model also appears amazing.<br />
<br />
Overall, 501st Legion Clone Troopers is an amazing set, and one which I will be purchasing several copies of. I definitely recommend this set to Star Wars fans of all ages, for having playability, displayability, and, its most likely use, army - building ability.</p>

"NoLegosNoDeal","2020-09-05T12:01:00.477Z","This set is the best!","<p>In first place i wanna mention that this set comes with 3 awesome looking 501st clone troopers. I have to say i really like how clean they look. They include really detailed torso &amp; leg printing &amp; even toe printing! I also really like this new helmet printing, i think it looks a lot better than the 2013 one. The face print is also cool enough, i guess... just, I&#39;m not convinced about this new colouring... i think the white hips are a lot better, i think they make it look a lot cleaner, just like the arms.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Next up we have the 501st jet trooper, i really like the torso printing &amp; the inclusion of this blue arms, i think they make it more distinguible than the others. I allso really like the helmet print for him, i think it looks amazing!</p>

<p>And last but not least this set includes 2 b1 battle droids, so, with this set you are&#39;nt only building your 501st army, because you have the ability to build your battle droid army!</p>

<p>The vehicles are allso really cool, but if you buy this set, it will be for the Minifigs&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, in conclusion, i think it&#39;s a really good set &amp; it&#39;s a must buy for any star &nbsp;wars fan, specially if &nbsp;you like the clone wars!</p>

"ShilohCyan","2021-04-23T13:58:38.373Z","Odd choices reduce poseability and accuracy","<p>This is my first Star Wars system set in 13 years and..... I&#39;m disappointed. The midsection of the walker has odd gaps and the head neither swivels nor bobs up and down. Only the stud shooter moves, which was a long cannon in the movie and just looks kind of pathetic here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Looking up other clone minifigs, I inadvertently noticed both the walker and speeder are practically copied and pasted from old sets from 10 years ago, yet the few changes that were made were not for the better. The walker&#39;s legs are bare!!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I was able to get the head to swivel and look up and down and fill in the midsection&#39;s gaps within 10 minutes and minimal effort, but that effort shouldn&#39;t have needed to be made for a battle pack that costs 3 times what battle packs originally did, and with not much more stuff! Sets don&#39;t need to reinvent the wheel. Heck, the Falcon&#39;s been using the same roof strategy since 2004 and it still works great. But here it just feels lazy.&nbsp;The same build except with parts and poseability&nbsp;taken out. I&#39;d honestly take the 2005 AT-RT over this if not for the minifigs.</p>

<p>Speeder&#39;s.......... okay I guess. Ridiculously long and mostly copied/pasted again&nbsp;</p>

<p>Insanely overpriced, and the clones having white arms just adds to this feel of incompleteness.&nbsp;</p>

<p>-Parts, this set is the first super battle pack ever and it&nbsp;includes 6 minifigs, three&nbsp;501st leigon clone troopers, a 501st leigon jet trooper, and 2 battle droids. It has a 501st barc speeder which is a nice build and a 501st At-RT which I feel the same about.</p>

<p>-Playability, This set is the best possible way to build and expand your republic army. The barc speeder has twin stud shooters on the side and the AT-RT has a stud shooter on the front. Obviously it is fun to get out all your droids and clones and have a huge battle and this set certainly helps with that.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-11-26T07:22:08.837Z","A Classic Space Star Wars Set!!!","<p>This is a set that had a lot of interest because it features the 501st who were obviously a huge part of the Clone Wars series. However, it wasn&#39;t on my must have list as I already own way too many clones, and just couldn&#39;t justify spending the money on this set only to get a bit of blue on their uniforms. I also don&#39;t typically like getting two smaller builds in a set. But when this went on sale for Black Friday, I just couldn&#39;t pass it up, and boy am I glad I got it!</p>

<p><strong>Box / Instructions&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>First of all the box (and instructions) made me pretty happy since in the corner of the box is a picture of one of Ahsoka&#39;s troopers from the 501st, and while they aren&#39;t included in this set, they were the minifigure that I most wanted to get from the final season of Clone Wars (I picked up <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75283-1/Armored-Assault-Tank"">75283</a> as well since it was on sale).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>The parts of course are what made me so excited as this is why I call this a Classic Space set! Now at first glance you would probably assume I was making reference to all the blue and gray bricks, and certainly it is a beautiful color scheme to any Lego fan from the 80&#39;s, but that is just the tip of the iceberg. This set includes parts that I&#39;ve not seen used in Lego sets for years. For one it features four of the Classic Space robot arms, 2 in black and 2 in gray. It also includes four of the headlight bricks and numerous small radar dish bricks (not sure if that is the correct name for them). You also get two of those faucet looking bricks, two 1x2 plates with the L-shaped bar coming out of them, and one of the 1x2 plates with holders coming off of either end on 45. All of these elements are very reminiscent of Classic Space sets. As is the vertical hinge and trans-red studs. The only thing missing from this set is trans-yellow, but I blame Dave Filoni for that omission!</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Now I assume that 99 out of 100 people purchasing this set are doing so strictly for the minifigures, and they do not disappoint. The three standard members of the 501st look incredible and I love the subtle differences and the red that is used on the jet trooper. Now I do wish that we got a Captain Rex, but I really can&#39;t complain about this wonderful collection of troopers and the fact we got four of them in a pretty small set. I am glad however they left Anakin out as it allowed&nbsp;for another clone.</p>

<p>You also get two battle droids, probably the least exciting minifigures in the galaxy far, far away. But who cares, that makes six minifigures in a set with only 285 parts! Also I think this is the first time I ever got battle droids new, my other thousand of them all came from garage sales. As a result I was very impressed to discover that their body parts all connect with a good amount of friction so they aren&#39;t just constantly collapsing like all the ones I own from the first few years of the Star Wars line. I&#39;ll be interested to see how they hold up.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>So bag 1 is the speeder and bag 2 the walker. The speeder is fairly straightforward although the handlebars are creative as is the use of skis along the sides. Other than that it is only 2 studs wide with the entire top portion of it relying on jumper plates to make it a single stud wide. I do wish that they included some of those inverse rounded tiles for the bottom as standard plates make this one speeder that is incapable of speeding!</p>

<p>The walker is pretty standard and no different from any other walker I&#39;ve ever built, and I&#39;ve built quite a few. I do enjoy the size of it however. It may be a little too large, but it looks very good and is still much smaller than an AT-ST. It is definitely a big improvement over the one that folds up into <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8098-1/Clone-Turbo-Tank"">8098 Clone Turbo Tank</a>. It also balances itself incredibly well, even on uneven carpet in my basement!</p>

<p>Now unfortunately the set is heavily dependent on stickers, but they do greatly add to the overall look of both models.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Both models look surprisingly good and are decently sized for a set that only has 285 parts (and 34 of them are the minifigures). &nbsp;Of course any Clone Wars fan would be thrilled to have this set for the minifigures alone and the speeder and walker both look fantastic as well and played an integral part in the Clone Wars.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However for me, and any other child of the 80&#39;s who grew up with Classic Space, this is the best thing since <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70816-1/Benny-s-Spaceship-Spaceship-SPACESHIP!"">Spaceship, Spaceship, Spaceship!</a> Although <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70841-1/Benny-s-Space-Squad"">Benny&#39;s Space Squad</a> had better pink minifigures!</p>

<p>&nbsp;I highly recommend this set for any Star Wars or Classic Space fans out there. If you get it on sale, it is a tremendous bargain, but even at full price you won&#39;t be disappointed. But I wouldn&#39;t hesitate to get this set, because once it is retired you&#39;ll be kicking yourself for not buying it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lego star wars 501st legion clone troopers is an amazing set with amazing figures , good builds and the best value for a currently available set .</p>

<p>The Minifigures -</p>

<p>The minifigures , just ignoring their greatness , include three identical 501st troopers with great helmet prints , nice new for summer 2020 clone heads , great detailed torso with appropriately placed white arms and good leg printing with exceptional toe prints and the Accessories for these three are just the standard Lego blasters , the 501st jet trooper is a great inclusion with a helmet looking similar to (RIP) ARC trooper fives , the same clone face , a mandalorian style blue jet pack , nice torso printing with blue arms and the same legs as the other troops , his accessory is the regular long rifle with the black candle stick piece added to the end to make it a DC-15A rifle I believe . And finally the most shocking inclusion is two battle droids this is great as these are exceptional army builders with the tan , head moulds , body , different arms and stationary legs and their regular blaster Accessories .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build for the BARC speeder is very nice and surprisingly long making it not minifigure scale but I couldn&#39;t care less about that&nbsp; ; the front has a new piece for a pointed 2&times;2 tile and two side mounted stud shooters with little stabilising fins , there is a large central top slope stickered , with a blue nexo knights shield underneath for sloping , the seating area features a very nice chair and very pose able handle bars , behind that there is another sloped brick with three very painful to put on stickers and a side intake on each side using a snot technic technique and finally there is an extra rifle on each side accurate to the speeder in universe . The other build of the set is an AT-RT starting with &nbsp;the feet they are curved on the sides and use a silver&nbsp;tooth piece for the toes , there is a ratchet joint that connects them to the leg assembly which first off has a sticker on each piece and the next leg subassembly uses some dishes for what represents some sockets then the base is very straight forward but effective , the head is very nicely built at the front with a mixture of wings , cheese slopes and tiles at least one of each using a sticker , then the seating area is sloped nicely with two varying sizes of antennas at the very back securely connected with clips , the controls include a 1&times;2 printed cheese slope and a pair of handle bars and finally the cannon is unfortunately just a &nbsp;stud shooter which is a bit of a shame&nbsp; .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is the best Lego set of this year , not my favourite , but the best , it has perfect figures , great builds and an incredible value , my only complaints are&nbsp; ; nowhere to put the BARC speeder drivers weapon whilst he is in the speeder , the amount of stickers and the cannon on the AT-RT just a great set and thanks to M&amp;R productions for his&nbsp;campaign to make this set happen (with a method that isn&#39;t annoying in my eyes) .I hope&nbsp;to get to at least three of them in my collection as I am really getting into a smaller scale of army building .</p>

"CaptainKindling","2020-10-09T23:10:56.783Z","This is where the fun begins...","<p>Alongside the new AAT with Ahsoka Tano and her much sought-after 332nd Clone Trooper, Lego have brought us the new 501st set to scratch that Clone Wars itch so many of us have.&nbsp; While 501st troopers have turned up on occasion in other sets, this is the first opportunity to get a few at once for a decent price.</p>

<p>So, at &pound;25 for 285 pieces this set presents good value for money right from the outset.&nbsp; Interestingly the aforementioned AAT comes in at &pound;35 for just 1 more piece, clocking in at 286, so you&#39;re definitely getting more for your money from a price-per-piece point of view with the 501st.</p>

<p>The build it split across 2 bags, with the first bag comprising of the BARC speeder and the second the AT-RT.&nbsp; Both of these are relatively straightforward builds, taking me roughly 45 minutes to put together, and if bought for a younger Lego fan they shouldn&#39;t cause any issues.&nbsp; It&#39;s worth pointing out that the sticker count is pretty high for a set of this size, with 9 stickers (3 of them going on a single piece on the BARC speeder!).&nbsp; While these do add an extra degree of detail - especially on the AT-RT where they add the &quot;501st&quot; batallion number - they are a sticking point (get it?) for some collectors, and younger builders may need help getting them lined up nice and straight.</p>

<p>Once the relatively short build is over, you&#39;re left with 2 nice little vehicles with a bit of playability.&nbsp; The BARC speeder has twin stud-shooters at the front for knocking down the supplied Battle Droids.&nbsp; The AT-RT has a bit more going on - while it only has a single stud-shooter, it can be swivelled to take care of any flaking enemies!&nbsp; The legs are also fully poseable, and obviously both vehicles have space for one of the supplied Clones.&nbsp; As far as aesthetics go, the BARC speeder is a great recreation of the original vehicle.&nbsp; The AT-RT is also very good, but replacing the cannon with a stud shooter, while increasing playability, does detract a little from its overall look.&nbsp; With a bit of creativity this can be rectified, but if you&#39;re a purist and don&#39;t like to modify your sets, then this is a slight downside.</p>

<p>The minifigures will obviously be the main selling point with this set.&nbsp; From the 501st Legion you get 3 Clone Troopers and 1 Jet Trooper.&nbsp; All of these have got really nicely detailed printing on the torso, legs and helmets.&nbsp; While some may have wanted a named character in the mix, such as Captain Rex or Jesse, the choice to make them all generic 501st Clones allows collectors to build up their Clone army without ending up with a stack of duplicate characters.&nbsp; And of course with all this Clone firepower you&#39;re going to need something to shoot at, so a pair of Battle Droids are provided as well.&nbsp; These aren&#39;t anything special, with no printing of any kind, but really are just there to be cannon fodder.</p>

<p>As a side note, while this is informally regarded as &quot;The 501st Battle Pack&quot; it&#39;s not officially a battle pack, the upshot of which is that all of the minifigures have standard blasters instead of stud-shooters.</p>

<p>So all-in-all, a really nice set.&nbsp; Unsurprisingly early demand for this set is high, but it as the months roll by availability should stop being quite such an issue.&nbsp; Aside from the slight stud-shooter/cannon issue with the AT-RT, this is aesthetically a great little pack, and with 2 small vehicles and 6 minifigures you&#39;re getting a lot for your money.&nbsp; A must-buy for any Lego fan who loves the 501st or just the prequel-era in general.</p>

"NYBuilder","2021-03-04T15:54:04.217Z","Almost perfection","<p>A long awaited set, and it delivers. Excellent mini figures with fantastic details and customization. A large speeder and AT-RT made for the 501st. One complaint that is seen is that the vehicles are not quite to scale. However with four excellently crafted 501st mini figures and two battle droids this is a must have for anyone looking to build their army.</p>

"QCK","2021-06-12T14:15:07.247Z","The latest, the greatest.","<p>This set is simple, and sometimes simple is the best.&nbsp; 4 Minifigures, 2 builds. The figures are very well detailed and fairly accurate, the jetpack trooper is even better. (Though I have seen misprints I have never encountered them, but I may have just been lucky)</p>

<p>Even&nbsp;if you don&#39;t want the builds I would still recommend this for army-building. (Probably just add then to your parts collection or make something else with them) The builds are things we have seen before, recoloured&nbsp;and slightly redesigned here.</p>

<p>I would recommend this set to any fans of Star Wars, but especially prequel and The Clone Wars fans.</p>

"wingnutjb","2021-10-23T18:00:47.397Z","Not bad on sale","<p>This could have been a good standard Battle Pack if they&#39;d skipped the droids, included the 4 clones with dark blue colouring, and had a sensible sized BARC like that in 7913. The clones are great looking but sadly the set is bloated and overrated.</p>

"Captainfives1514","2023-01-01T19:44:34.927Z","Rex’s Boys","<p>&nbsp; The 501st Legion served under Jedi General Anakin Skywalker and Captain Rex. This set is the perfect example of a battle pack. Including several clone troopers and two battle droids for opposition.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Three of the troopers are 501st clone soldiers with blue decorations marking their phase II clone armour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; One trooper is a 501st Jetpack trooper he has red markings on his helmet and torso with blue arms and a blue jet pack.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Two battle droids are included.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The build is pretty simple and straightforward. First you build a clone BARC speeder. Then you build a Clone Walker or AT-RT. They both are a bit large compared to the Minifigures but look amazing as far as details go. The speeder has stud shooters and the walker can move its legs and has a single stud shooter.</p>

<p>&nbsp; Overall this is a great set. The only complaint I have is that the AT-RT&#39;s legs and feet have a limited range of motion. I also would have liked them to have included Captain Rex in phase II armour, but I guess that would have defeated the purpose of a battle pack. Other than that this is a great set with loads of playability and details. I am sad to see it go after a good long two year production run. I can only hope for as great of success with 75345 501st Clone Trooper Battle Pack.</p>

"ItisNoe","2022-04-18T18:04:51.317Z","The 501st Legion Clone Troopers - One of the best","<p>The long awaited set brought about the fans apparently disappointed many, based off what I saw from the comment section of the official review. I don&#39;t understand this at all. While I understand that what people expect out of a quote-un-quote, &#39;Battle Pack&#39;, is a small build and 4 massable figures, I think this simply accomplishes the same achievement on a greater scale. Many people complain about this not being minifigure&nbsp;scale, but this holds no weight as most Star Wars sets are either vastly undersized or sometime oversized. The BARC Speeder is truthfully quite long, but the level of detail and smoothness makes up for this size expansion. As for the AT-RT, its colour scheme and various details do improve over 75002, while simultaneously being closer to minifigure scale. The stud shooter could&#39;ve been improved however, and the frontal armour of&nbsp;75002 is more appealing to me&nbsp;that the modern version, despite likely being less accurate. As for the minifigures, outside of the strange absence of belt, possible partial blue arm printing for the normal trooper, and perhaps a dual moulded jetpack, they are perfect. The minifigures feature outstanding detail, along with a more Episode 3 accurate face. The battle droids require no changes as they were perfected long ago, although a STAP or driodeka would&#39;ve helped with imaginative play and helped make the price of $30 U.S better to some people. All in all, the 501st Legion Clone Troopers is an excellent set with what is possibly the most celebrated clone legion in all of Star Wars.</p>

"CommanderCody05","2022-06-26T04:35:05.237Z","Best ""Unofficial"" Battle Pack!!","<p>This was the first battle pack I purchased. Since then, I have bought several other battle packs and this remains the best.</p>

<p>The Republic Forces.</p>

<p>&nbsp; The number of clones was the first reason I bought this. The updated version of these minifigures are far better than their earlier counterparts. Their printings are very close to those in the cartoon and I love the inclusion of the rocket trooper, rather than another clone trooper or Jedi.</p>

<p>&nbsp;AT-RT:</p>

<p>&nbsp; The walker is a great model and can have better articulation if you flip the legs. I wish the model itself was small and minifigure scale. I also opted to replace the stud shooter gun with a more accurate gun.</p>

<p>&nbsp;BARC Speeder:</p>

<p>&nbsp;The speeder seems oversized, but it has lots of detail and I can live with that. Building the model was very enjoyable, which surprised me.</p>

<p>Overall:</p>

<p>The set was well executed and a big thumbs up to the designer. It provides a great way to build your armies and bust up some clankers!</p>
