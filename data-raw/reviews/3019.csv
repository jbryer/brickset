"shenron","2007-12-27T17:53:58.31Z","Diminutive addition","When looking at a diminutive set such as this, it has to be put in the right perspective: the main reason for these sets are to add a minifigure to your town. As long as the minifig is cool and some a couple of interesting accessories, the set has served its purpose.

This one goes beyond.

The minifig is simple but cool enough, with a hard to find blue cap (there were no blue caps for 20 years until some 2002 train sets) and with a men-at-work vest.
The cart is really simple, but with only 6 pieces it has handles, wheels and leg, and makes a clever use of low fences. If it had two hooks for the spade and broom it would have won an Oscar.
As a totally unneeded extra, a tree is included.

Overall this little set has immediate playability, good economic design, and very decent look.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
