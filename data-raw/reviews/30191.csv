<p>For the 26th issue of the Lego City Comic you get two minifigures! A policeman and a criminal, who for once appear to be evenly matched as they are both on foot, rather that previous Lego City sets from the main sets where capture of the crook is of no doubt.&nbsp; As it&#39;s only two minifigures you only get ten parts, but each comes with an accessory and both would compliment any city.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The front shows that you get two minifigures, and has a great image of the crook trying to run away from a handcuff brandishing policeman.&nbsp; The crook has his &quot;presumably&quot; stolen money in hand and seems very happy with his haul.</p>

<p>Behind the two minifigures there is a city skyline with a police helicopter tracking the chase from above.&nbsp; There is also a seagull flying over.&nbsp; The set is aimed at age 5+ for which I am&nbsp;not fully sure why as 4+ sets have minifigures so there would be no problem with younger children building&nbsp;these.</p>

<p>The back of the packet has a 1:1&nbsp;image of the handcuffs and a warning saying not for under threes.&nbsp; It also contains the usual warnings in a plethora of languages.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>This sets has two, which is the first time since issue 1!&nbsp; Unfortunately that issue was very similar as it contained a policeman and a crook.&nbsp; These figures are different enough however for that not to be a problem and so long ago that the kids this is aimed at most likely won&#39;t have got them as it was released in 2017.</p>

<p>The policeman, or Gary Goodman who claims &quot;I catch crooks in my sleep&quot; in the comic has parts that are very common.&nbsp; His earth blue hat has appeared in 53 sets to date, although surprisingly only in one of the 2020 Police sets [<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60270-1/Police-Brick-Box"">60270</a>].&nbsp; His head is very common too as it is in 55 sets.&nbsp; The torso is slightly rare as it can only be found in 19 sets, but the earth blue legs are in 347 different sets to date, sometimes more than once.</p>

<p>Charlie Crooker thinks he will never be caught, but with a force the size of Lego City, it won&#39;t be long.&nbsp; His black hat has been used for criminal activity in most of the 89 sets it&#39;s appeared in over the years but his head piece is less common as only in 14 sets.&nbsp; The torso appears in 19 sets and the reddish brown legs in over 90 sets (under different part numbers).</p>

<p>To get most of each minifigure parts set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60241-1/Police-Dog-Unit"">60241</a> gives you the heads and torso&#39;s.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>This is all about the minifigures, so there are no additional builds.&nbsp; You get a set of handcuffs and a 1X2 printed dark green money tile.&nbsp; My collection has plenty of these, as a lot of police sets come with both so the parts are not rare in any way.&nbsp; I just looked and Brickset tells me I have 13,800 of Lego currency!&nbsp; I think I need to rebuild the Brick Bank to keep that safe.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>Despite not having a little build to make this set is good and if you can get it then do so.&nbsp; It&#39;s just a shame that it makes this the 9th police set out of the 26 released to date so it would be nice to have two minifigures from a different part of the Lego City.</p>

<p>At a price of &pound;3.99 in the UK the value for money is fantastic, even if you only but the comic for the set attached to it and don&#39;t read the comic.</p>

<p>Next up for Issue 27 it&#39;s a Go-Kart, which will be the second one on the front of the comics and will hopefully go well with the one from Issue 7.</p>
