<p><strong>- Original Review -</strong></p>

<p>LEGO Mario Time, today I will be taking&nbsp;a look at the new LEGO Mario 71360 Adventures with Mario set that released August 1st 2020. This set contains 231 pieces and retails for &pound;49.99/$59.99 giving a price per part of 21p/25c, quite high but bear in mind this has a bit of technology includes.</p>

<p>This set is essential for the course building system that the LEGO Mario theme is built on. This set includes the all important Mario figure plus two enemies to defeat. Let&#39;s start taking a look at this set with the Mario figurine himself.</p>

<p><strong>Mario figurine</strong></p>

<p>LEGO Mario is only included in this set, and he is very crucial for anyone wanting to use this theme as intended. This figure contains 4 major tech features including music and sound, brick and colour recognition LCD screens and bluetooth connectivity. Before I get into the tech lets just look at the printing and moulding of this figure.</p>

<p>The Mario figure is made of 6 pieces, two new pieces for the Mario theme, his size is 4x3x7. The main body and head piece is all one piece that has 4 LCD screens one for his belly, his mouth and one for each of his eyes. Above his eyes he has some thick eyebrows and a nice bushy moustache powering over his mouth with his big bulgy nose sticking out. His hair goes nicely above his head and round to the back. On each side of his face there is a stud to place a 1x1 round tile in tan for his ears. On the top of his head are four studs to place his hat that is a new piece with the Mario logo printed in the front.</p>

<p>His torso which is still the same piece has the LCD screen and some pegs which cannot be seen when his trousers&nbsp;are put on. His arms are about 2x bigger than a regular minifigures arms, his hands work the same a minifigures with it allowing to be turned, and he can hold a pole item.</p>

<p>The back of the figure has a few different features, on his hair there are some small gaps for the speakers and the top of the battery panel that continues onto his back. The top of his back has two buttons one for connecting to a smart device via bluetooth and an on and off button. A small screw is under the button that secures the battery panel to Mario and keep kids safe from the batteries&nbsp;inside.</p>

<p>Mario&#39;s trousers are a separate piece in an exclusive blue colour that surrounds Mario&#39;s&nbsp;belly with a gap on the front for his belly&nbsp;LCD a gap at the back for the buttons, this trouser covers the screw. On the front of his trousers he has two studs for some buttons that are 1x1 round tiles in yellow. At the bottom of his trouser his shoes are moulded on in brown. The bottom of his trousers also has a hole for the colour recognition sensor to see what Mario&#39;s treading on.</p>

<p><b>Mario&#39;s technology</b></p>

<p>Mario has four major features starting with his colour sensor. On the bottom of the Mario piece is a brick and colour recognition sensor that can do 2 major jobs. Its main job is reading tiles with tags that are different for different blocks and characters. Sometimes Mario can defeat them for coins, say hi for coins, be spooked etc. This sensor can also read colours of bricks Mario is on, the four main colours are Red, Blue, Green and Yellow. When he treads on Green for grass, Blue for water and Yellow for sand he just makes the sounds of grass, water or sand. With the Red for Lava he will be hurt and start making sounds until he is starting to be hurt if you place him on water straight out of lava you will get some coins. This sensor has two LED lights around it to get a better read of tags and bricks.</p>

<p>His more noticeable features are his 4 LCD screens on his face and tummy. The most important screen is his belly one, this has many jobs from showing a timer, coins collected when you&#39;ve defeated an enemy also shows question blocks, time blocks and other blocks when you&#39;ve stood on them. Then his mouth shows well his mouth ofc, his mouth can change expressions for when he is one different blocks. When he makes sounds his tongue will also move slightly.</p>

<p>Next, his eye LCD&#39;s show his beautiful blue eyes that blink, look around and when his on Lava can go into XX or closes them when his asleep, more on how that works next.</p>

<p>Finally, he can react to movements such as being rocked side to side that causes him to go sleep, jumping makes him go wahoo. When Mario falls from a brick height&nbsp;he will be timed out for 5 seconds and his eyes will go all dizzy.</p>

<p>With every one of these features they all have sounds that come out of a speaker on that back of his head, unfortunately there is no way of muting or reducing or increasing Mario&#39;s volume. Also, to get Mario to work with the course building system and save results and coins etc you must connect him via Bluetooth to the LEGO Super Mario app pressing the Bluetooth Button on his back.</p>

<p>That is&nbsp;Mario in a nutshell.</p>

<p><strong>Other characters</strong></p>

<p>Now there&#39;s two other Characters to go with Mario, Bowser Junior and a Goomba, lets take a look at Bowser Junior first.</p>

<p><strong>Bowser Junior:</strong></p>

<p>Bowser is fully brick built as most characters in the Super Mario theme are. His feet are a new 2x3 plate with feet on 4 of the 6 studs anti studs, he has a printed 2x3 tiles for his belly and a new 2x4 rounded tile with his mouth and nose printed on with an exclusively printed 1x3 lime green brick for his eyes and bushy red eyebrows. On the top of his head are some tiles and a small bit of hair using a 1x1 cheese slope in red. On his back his shell is made using a new 4x4 shell piece with some raised white spikes and a 2x2 stud area for a 2x2 interactive tile for Mario to defeat Bowser with. It takes 5 hits with Mario to defeat Bowser Junior getting some coins.</p>

<p><strong>Goomba:</strong></p>

<p>Finally, for the characters is a small Goomba, who is the same in the 71377 King Boo&#39;s and the Haunted Yard set. This small build is built around 2 1x2x2 bricks with studs on three sides that has a set of 2x2 legs new for the Mario theme similar to Bowser Juniors but just 2x2. His face is printed on a 2x2 tile that has an interesting expression with his eyebrows bowing in and him looking a bit derpy. His two teeth stick out of the sides of his mouth. On the top is his interactive tile that Mario can jump on with just one hit and Mario get some coins.</p>

<p><strong>Interactive elements</strong></p>

<p>Asides from the main interactive characters there some additional parts that Mario can interact with. Each of these has an interactive tile for Mario to jump on.</p>

<p>Firstly lets start with the important start and finish. The Start has a new tube piece that is 6x6 wide with 4x4 hole in the middle for Mario to fit in. The inside of the tube has 2 2x4 blue bricks covered in some green tiles including the all important interactive tile that starts the 60-second timer for Mario. This build is all on a new 6x6 rounded plate that is 2 plates high in green.</p>

<p>The finishing build has an awesome flag of Bowsers face printed onto a black 2x3 tile with clips on one side that is connected onto a bendable grey pole piece that is prone to bending which can be annoying as this piece for my set came out a little bent. The top of the flag has a large ball joint piece with a stud with hole in the middle to make a flag pole top. This is all on a 6x6 rounded plate in green with the finishing interactive tile that Mario stands on to see his final score of coins collected throughout the round.</p>

<p>Next up is a Question block that is seen in 2 other sets, the Mushroom Surprise polybag and Bowsers Castle. This block has 1 of 6 options every time Mario steps on the interactive tile on the top. The tile is on a 2x2 printed brick with the Question Block printed on just two sides. Some of the&nbsp;6 options include a Mushroom or&nbsp;extra coins or extra time.</p>

<p>Finally, the other two interactive features make use of Mario&#39;s movement sensor. The first one is a cloud platform that Mario can stick onto a 4x rounded plate with 2x2 tiled service that has a interactive sticker which when read Mario can go flying, just move the platform around and you&#39;ll be collecting coins but be careful not to drop Mario as he can sometimes fall off despite being on studs. The other platform is a swinging bridge that Mario has to balance on the longer his on and turning without falling the more coins he will collect this is on a 8x8 rounded plate in blue with a turntable piece and some bricks to add height.</p>

<p><strong>Other builds</strong></p>

<p>Now the rest of the sets builds are just builds to add to your course and play around with. Firstly, there is a tower built with some dark nougat pieces including some of those new 6x6 rounded plates. The tower is built in two so the tower can be two towers. The one tower is on a 8x8 rounded plate in green.</p>

<p>Next there is a catapult platform which you could put one of the tower builds onto with Bowser Junior on to make a more fun way to defeat Bowser Jr. This build is very simple using very few parts for the mechanism. This too is on a 8x8 rounded plate in green.</p>

<p>The other bits are small little pieces of terrain that includes an island build identical to that in the Mushroom Surprise polybag without the Mushroom or Question block.&nbsp;Then 3 towering terrain pieces at three different heights for Mario to climb up, these all use 2 4x4 rounded plates in green with each tower using either 1x2x5, 1x2x3 or 1x1 bricks in a dark nougat colour.</p>

<p>Nearing the end just some minor decoration pieces like a cloud made using the Unikitty CMF platform plates on a clear pole connected to the ground with a leaf piece with some studs. A small tree built with very few parts with the core being a brown pole with connection at the bottom to make the tree secure and finally two small flower decor that can be placed where you want in the course.</p>

<p>There is also a load of connecting plates in red, blue and green to connect your course. This includes a red 8x8 rounded plate with some stepping stones for Mario to cross without being singed. These connecting pieces are 1x 2x4 plate in each colour, 3x 2x8 plates in each colour and 1x 2x12 plates in each colour.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions &amp; App</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t normally really go into the instructions&nbsp;but Mario&#39;s instructions in particular are unusual for LEGO, they are for the most part all digital including this one. Only the instructions to set up Mario and build Mario is in the small paper manual the rest is done on the LEGO Super Mario app.</p>

<p>The app is easy to set up and the build can take about half an hour. The virtual instructions also show you how each interactive feature works and how to use other features.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve completed this set in the app you can add other expansion sets and power up packs from the LEGO Super Mario theme. Its easy to get used to.</p>

<p>_________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>Wow, that is&nbsp;a lot, and that was only 231 pieces. This set has so much to offer play wise with a few interactive tiles for Mario to interact with to get more coins, obviously a more expansive and fun course would need on of the many expansion sets available with the first wave of sets. This set shows all of Mario&#39;s&nbsp;features from his speakers, LCD&#39;s to his sensors it&#39;s a great way to be introduced to the theme.</p>

<p>Although &pound;50, $60 sounds a lot for very few pieces i think this set is worth the price with all the new, large pieces plus Mario&#39;s tech. I also appreciate that all the interactive tiles have pre applied stickers and that there are no stickers in the whole theme that we need to apply.</p>

<p>I would recommend this set to any parent wanting to get something for their child that they would have hours of fun with. As for if this is AFOL teir of sets well that is debatable this is much more of a kids set or for someone who is an avid Mario fan and loves building their own courses. I would suggest maybe waiting for this to reach &pound;40 or $50 to buy it as the price does seem a little pricey but as i said i do feel that im getting my moneys worth at RRP.</p>

<p><strong>Pros -</strong> Mario figures tech, Bowser Junior, Goomba, all the amazing interactive features, great set for playing with.</p>

<p><strong>Cons -</strong> Price does seem slightly overpriced for what your actually getting</p>

<p>This set is now available in the UK LEGO Shop:</p>

<p><strong>2021 Update -</strong>&nbsp;<strong>&quot;</strong>In the 2021 sets Mario can also now interact with Purple bricks that represent the Soda Jungle. When Mario stands on Purple he starts to drown or be filled with soda, to stop this you just simply shake him or move him, shaking him will gain coins.<strong>&quot;</strong></p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-09-29T06:00:25.34Z","From the perspective of a parent of a 7 year old ","<p>This review is targeted at parents looking to get this set for your children. So my son got this for his 7th birthday and while he was most excited about getting a telescope, this was the number 2 present,&nbsp;and we spent the rest of the night and well past bedtime playing with it. His 4 year old sister enjoyed putting together Legos, but never actually played with Mario.</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;The App</strong></p>

<p>So the first thing you will notice is that the set does come with an instruction booklet that shows how to assemble Mario and then informs you to get the app. Well this is definitely problematic and something my wife was very unhappy with, but it is only a little screen time up front and then all play afterwards. The app is definitely a necessity, for one, the first thing it did was update Mario&#39;s firmware, which greatly improved his ability to see red (I was worried he was defective at first because he had a hard time responding to red). The app is not intuitive, quite honestly it is awful, your child will need a parent to help them guess their way through it. It also crashed once and I had to completely close it and reopen it to get it to work again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the app is really essential. The builds in this set are pretty much a joke to a 7 year old who has build a 1000+ brick AT-AT quite a few times. However after you build each play feature you get a video showing you how to play with it. Since the play features aren&#39;t exactly intuitive, this is important. That said, I do wish they gave you building instructions for in the future when you need to repair certain things, although giving you them with the set might result in you not getting the app and not learning how to play.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One more issue with the app, it is completely devoid of language. No words on the screen (not a big deal as my son is only beginning to read), but also no spoken words in the videos. I realize Lego sells to many countries and doesn&#39;t package sets any different in each country. But how hard would it have been to record these videos in a handful of languages, and then look at your device&#39;s language settings to determine the appropriate language?</p>

<p><strong>Mario</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, the Mario figure is what you are paying for and the reason you are buying this particular set. He is pretty impressive. You earn coins waddling, jumping, as well as using play features. He does keep time and play music to tell you what is going on. The music speeds up in the last 15 seconds to tell you to finish the level quickly. Of course the display tells you a lot and his eyes and mouth are fun little bonuses.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In order to truly play you do need to step on the start block (inside the pipe) to activate the timer and start counting coins, however if you don&#39;t, he will still react to everything, he just won&#39;t count how many coins you collect and it doesn&#39;t matter if you die.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For those who think he looks like a Duplo, don&#39;t worry, your kids won&#39;t look at him that way, to kids he is just a toy, and he does integrate with Lego and not with Duplo, so that thought will not occur to a child.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My son also didn&#39;t mind that the weren&#39;t any true minifigures. To a child this Mario and the brick built figures are good enough.</p>

<p><strong>Play Features</strong></p>

<p>You do get a surprisingly large amount of play features in this set. I was worried about this since you only see one Goomba and a Baby Bowser, but it is plenty to fill 60 seconds of play time, and the music will speed up before your kid is ready to go to the finish. I bought a few expansion sets and will be keeping those for the holidays, definitely not something that you need from the get go, although I can certainly see how adding a few interactive sets could keep up the enthusiasm if the starter pack starts getting old.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So the first feature is the Goomba and is easily the least interesting of all the features. The video shows Mario stomping on his head and then kicking him out of the way. Well you get a coin for stomping on him, but kicking does nothing. Needless to say, my son only stomps on him as a result.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Baby Bowser is more interesting as he needs to be kicked over so you can jump on his back. It also takes 5 jumps to defeat him. If you continue jumping on him I believe you continue to collect coins for a short period of time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You have a mystery box which you jump on top of, not underneath, but kids don&#39;t care about that. It can give you either 5 or 10 coins, a mushroom, a star, or 15 extra seconds. The star of course makes you invincible, which as far as I can tell means you can walk on lava. This is actually very&nbsp;exciting to my son. As for the mushroom, I can&#39;t figure out its purpose, now can my son, but it makes him happy to get a mushroom.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then you have a cloud which you simply place Mario onto and bounce around to collect points. It seems silly, but kids like it despite there being nothing challenging about it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;Then you have a spinning platform with a tile top that Mario needs to balance on as you spin him. This is the only &quot;challenging&quot; obstacle, and while it is fairly easy, you can&#39;t go to fast which actually makes it quite the challenge for children.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only other interactive piece is the flag which ends the level. If you don&#39;t end before time runs out you die, but it still shows your coin total. But the most exciting part of the game is finishing and seeing how many coins you got. It&#39;s quite amazing, you can do the same exact thing two games in a row and finish with 23 or 52 coins, there doesn&#39;t appear to be any rhyme or reason to it, but this randomness keeps kids interested.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond that you get a couple castles, some lava, and a few hills, none of which do anything. You also get a catapult that can knock over a castle, but no coins are rewarded so my son isn&#39;t too interested. It also only works if the castle is loosely sitting on the catapult and nothing is behind it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;The Builds&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Each build is like 6 bricks max which makes them way too simple and boring. My son was basically doing it without even having to look. This is indeed a disappointment, but at the same time I completely understand, you are building little play features, not complex vehicles, everything needs to be at the scale of Mario, who while bigger than a minifigure, isn&#39;t exactly huge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for building different course and connecting them with the long plates, this is something Lego does a very poor job of explaining to children. My son saw this more of just a bunch of free standing objects which he arranged in a line the way he wanted them. The idea of offering different paths to the finish did not occur to him. This is definitely another disappointment.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Play</strong></p>

<p>This is why you buy this set, and I&#39;ve walked through each play feature already. Of course, Lego describes how to use each play feature, but does not describe following a path or a progression. As a result my son just jumps around to wherever he wants. Certainly this is something Lego should have explained to children. It isn&#39;t exactly a problem as my son still enjoys playing randomly, and there is no wrong way to play. But I think introducing rules is important to young children.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>To an adult, this set isn&#39;t perfect, but to a child it is. My son didn&#39;t mind a super simple build as it was immediately followed by trying out the new play feature. Plus this set is just so much fun to play with, even if you aren&#39;t playing with it the way Lego intended.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One thing that is missing from this set however is yellow, which Mario treats as sand. I&#39;m not sure this is really a problem however, my son discovered this on his own by jumping on the wrong part of Bowser. I then said to him that he has yellow Legos he could add to this set, and he was very excited to do so.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The set isn&#39;t intuitive so you do need the app (and a tablet), and you will need to help your child get the hang of following the video instructions. However, at the end of the day you will have a very fun &quot;real&quot; video game. The best part of course is that your kid can play Mario without having to stare at a screen. Despite the short term use of an app, this really is a great toy for parents who are careful about how much screen time their children get.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set really should be viewed as a toy for children, and when looked at that way, it is perfect. It is clear that Lego and Nintendo did a lot of research into how to take the &quot;video&quot; out of &quot;video game&quot;, and they did a tremendous job. For AFOLs hoping for something else and expressing extreme disappointment in this, you are not the target audience, it&#39;s as simple as that. But to a child this set is perfect in every way.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I do highly recommend this set for parents of young children. My son just turned 7, his 4 year old sister however had no interest playing with Mario, she was more interested in using the long plates for building her own creations. I think that the target age group for this set is probably elementary school students.&nbsp;Clearly it isn&#39;t for preschoolers, kindergarten and first graders will love it, but&nbsp;I don&#39;t know how older kids would react to it. I&#39;d like to think that my son will enjoy this for several more years, but only time will tell. For now it is a very successful birthday present.&nbsp;</p>

"lkb57","2021-01-31T14:48:30.333Z","One of the best things to happen to Lego in a long, long time","<p>I&#39;ve owned the Lego Super Mario starter set for about six months now, and I&#39;ve been meaning to review it for a while now. Currently, buying this set is the only way to get your hands on the Lego Mario &ldquo;minifigure&rdquo;, and is thus required to use all the other expansion sets that have been released.</p>

<p>Long story short, I am a huge fan of this set and the whole Super Mario Theme. TLG designers have done an amazing job translating the look of Mario into Lego bricks, and of capturing the fun of Super Mario video games in a way that still feels true to Lego. And the bonus: my kids are OBSESSED with this new theme, so it has provided a fun new way for our family to enjoy spending time together.</p>

<h2>The Super Mario &ldquo;Minifigure&rdquo;</h2>

<p>The Super Mario minifigure is the centrepiece of this set and of the entire theme. I know that a lot of folks<img alt="""" src=""https://img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/MN/0/mar0007.png"" style=""width: 231px; height: 361px; margin: 10px; float: left;"" />&nbsp;were (and still are) disappointed that TLG didn&#39;t create a traditional minifigure of Mario, but I have loved the design of this guy right from the beginning. I think the &ldquo;blocky&rdquo; style does an excellent job of representing Mario in all of his iterations, his cubic look harking back to the&nbsp;pixelated NES version, while the detailing clearly takes inspiration from the modern Wii and Switch versions.</p>

<p>After playing with three different Mario figures for nearly half a year, I can say that the electronic functions work really well. The accelerometer is very sensitive to most motions (like making Mario jump or fly), although it sometimes has trouble sensing small movements (like&nbsp;&quot;walking&quot; Mario or tipping him to &quot;throw&quot; fireballs). Mario is powered by two normal AAA batteries, and these can be drained fairly quickly if you&#39;re playing with your Mario a lot, so you should be aware that you&#39;ll be purchasing batteries fairly often.&nbsp;The only real annoyance I&#39;ve experienced are the regular updates that are installed when you pair Mario with the smartphone app, sometimes they take quite a while to instal (~10 minutes or so) so plan accordingly.</p>

<p>The actual construction of the Mario figure is pretty good, although I have noticed a few small issues. The connection between Mario&#39;s arms and body isn&#39;t as strong or tight as in a normal minifigure, and we actually lost one arm fairly early on. I think this is because the socket head on&nbsp;Mario&#39;s arm isn&#39;t as large as a normal minifigure arm. I assume this is&nbsp;because the designers had to preserve room inside Mario for the batteries and electronics. Most of the time this isn&#39;t an issue, but you should probably be wary of letting very small children fiddle with Mario&#39;s arms too much. I&#39;ve also noticed that the plastic of Mario&#39;s body around the arm hole can crack fairly easily. This seems to be because the plastic there is unusually thin for a Lego piece. Again, this is undoubtedly due to the design challenge of cramming all the electronics inside Mario. The only other thing I&#39;ve noticed is that the &quot;clutch&quot; between Mario&#39;s hats and the four studs on his head seems to be a little less than is&nbsp;normal for regular bricks. Not a big deal, but something to be aware of. These minor issues aside, Mario is surprisingly robust, and can handle pretty rigorous play in the hands of a small child.</p>

<p>Mario&#39;s expressions and sound effects are delightful, and really capture the charm of the original character. My kids will play for hours with Mario, setting up courses, or even just making him walk and jump around. Lego really knocked it out the park with this character.</p>

<h2>The Other Characters</h2>

<p>In addition to the electronic Mario figure, the starter course includes two brick built characters: Bowser Jr. and a Goomba.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/MN/0/mar0003.png"" style=""margin-top: 10px; margin-bottom: 10px; float: left; width: 269px; height: 400px;"" /><img alt="""" src=""https://img.bricklink.com/ItemImage/MN/0/mar0022.png"" style=""margin: 125px 75px; width: 175px; height: 165px;"" /></p>

<p>These brick-built characters are delightful, and for an AFOL like me, one of the key attractions of this set, and the entire Super Mario Theme. All the character details (eyes, mouths, etc.) are printed, which is awesome. The designs do an excellent job of capturing the characters in brick form. They include several new pieces, including the Bowser Jr.&#39;s<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6308887/feet-2x3x2-3-no-1""> 2x3 yellow feet</a>,&nbsp;the Goomba&#39;s <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6300006/feet-2x2x2-3-no-1"">2x2 reddish&nbsp;brown feet</a>, and Bowser Jr.&#39;s <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6315223/decoration-element-4x4-no-2"">shell</a>.</p>

<p>Both the characters make use of the new action bricks, which Mario can scan. The action bricks feature factory-applied bar codes that are unique to each character. Mario interacts with each character and/or action brick differently. The Goomba requires 1 &ldquo;bounce&rdquo; to defeat, while Bowser Jr. requires five. Mario earns coins by defeating these enemies and by interacting with the other action bricks, which include:</p>

<p>By stepping on the Start Brick, Mario begins a course run, and has 60 seconds to complete it by stepping on the Goal Brick. During those 60 seconds, Mario earns coins by defeating enemies and interacting with other action bricks like the &ldquo;spinner&rdquo;, mystery block brick,&nbsp;and cloud bricks shown above. With just this starter set, there are a finite number of coins you can earn during one run of the course.&nbsp;However, as you add in more <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Super-Mario/subtheme-Expansion-Set"">expansion sets</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Super-Mario/subtheme-Power-Up-Pack"">power up packs</a>, and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/theme-Super-Mario/subtheme-Character-Pack-Series-1"">character packs</a>, the courses become more complex and Mario is able to earn more and more coins.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>Compared to a normal Lego set of comparable price, the builds in this set (and every Super Mario set) are relatively simple. For some, this might be a turn-off; however, as a AFOL who has never really built any kinetic models, I found that building the simple mechanisms that the Mario minifigure interacts with (for example, the launcher that is designed to catapult Bowser Jr. off his tower) were not only fun, but inspired me to try building my own interactive course pieces. The colors used in the set are bright and perfectly capture the fun, cute feeling of the levels in the Mario video games. And again, keep in mind that the complexity of the builds increases exponentially as you add more and more expansion sets and character packs. Final thought on the build: I found it really refreshing and fun to build in a new non-minifigure scale. Now, I know I could have built at different scales at any time, but this set provided me with the perfect excuse to begin doing so.</p>

<h2>The Final Verdict</h2>

<p>The Super Mario starter set is the required entry point into the new Mario theme . . . luckily, it&#39;s a great set and in my opinion, the Mario minifigure makes the steep price per piece easy to swallow. The other brick-built figures are fantastic, and this set alone provides for hours of play, even without the other expansion packs. The Super Mario theme is definitely the most exciting new development that Lego has seen in at least the past 10 years, making this starter set a must-buy. Get it while you can!</p>

"ICAbricks","2022-06-05T23:32:05.33Z","Can't really complain, because it's the only set to include Mario.","<p>My mom got me this for my birthday, and it&#39;s pretty cool. I&#39;m gonna split this up like my other reviews:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Figures:</b></p>

<p>Mario only comes in this set, and he&#39;s pretty cool. He reacts to different things. Like, when you take of his pants, he exclaims &quot;mamma mia!&quot; He also has some other features that I&#39;ll explain throughout the review.</p>

<p>Bowser Jr. is fun to get. I kind of wish we had gotten Bowser in this set instead, because his son is a bit more obscure, but Bowser also probably would&#39;ve been too large.&nbsp;If&nbsp;you stomp on him five times, you will defeat him and he yields 10 coins. If you stomp on him again after that, it takes only one stomp to defeat him and you get one coin.</p>

<p>The Goomba is a basic enemy, and I&#39;m satisfied with the inclusion. Stomping on his back gives you one coin. You can repeat the process as many times as you want.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Builds:</strong></p>

<p>The Start Pipe has a tile that starts the level. You start out with 60 seconds to complete the course, and Mario gives you a warning when you have 15 seconds left. My only complaint is that the Start Pipe should have been a darker green, but that&#39;s just me.</p>

<p>The Rotator is pretty tricky. It has no studs, so Mario is prone to slipping away from the tile, or even worse, falling off completely. It gives you coins in a somewhat unpredictable pattern.</p>

<p>The cloud is pretty fun. It gives you one coin at a time for rocking it to and fro. However, Mario is heavy enough that he falls off pretty frequently. I did figure out a way to cheat this, though: hold Mario&#39;s body instead of the cloud&#39;s handle.</p>

<p>The Question-Mark Block (stylized ? Block) will give you a random item. Each one appears only once. They are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Super Star (pauses your timer for as long as the music plays and gives you twice as many coins when you stomp on enemies - for example, you get one coin from the Goomba normally, but you get two coins with the Super Star)</li>
	<li>Super Mushroom (protects you from lava, poison, or falling off a challenge)</li>
	<li>15 extra seconds</li>
	<li>5 coins</li>
	<li>10 coins</li>
</ul>

<p>After using all of those, you just get one coin each time.</p>

<p>There is one tower with a lever behind it. If Mario stomps on the lever, the tower will fall over, dumping its contents so that they&#39;re more accessible.</p>

<p>The Finish Flag/Goal Pole/whatever the heck you want to call it is how you end the level. A flag will appear on Mario&#39;s belly and then it will show you how many coins you got. Mario reacts differently depending on how many you got:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Under 10 - remains silent</li>
	<li>10-49 - &quot;Mario Time!&quot;</li>
	<li>50-79 - &quot;Mario Number One!&quot;</li>
	<li>80-99 - &quot;Yahoo!&quot;</li>
	<li>Over 100 - has different music and displays fireworks behind the coin score</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don&#39;t make it to the flag before your time runs out, Mario will say &quot;Uh-oh, no!&quot; and display the coin score that you would have gotten. After finishing a course, if you put Mario on the flag tile, he will display the coin score from his last run. There is one glitch I have noticed though: if you place Mario on the flag too quickly, he will become dizzy. He will still display the coin score, but he will still have swirling eyes and chirping noise indefinitely. The only way to fix this is to either put him back in the Start Pipe or turn him off.</p>

<p>Other than that, you just get some basic terrain. There&#39;s a large red plate with stepping stones, a large green plate with a tower, and three small plates - one green, one blue, and one red. A good selection, although&nbsp;I do kinda wish they had the desert biome in this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall:</strong></p>

<p>I have to say I&#39;m pretty satisfied with this set. You get a good selection of enemies and challenges. And it&#39;s also the only set that you can get Mario in. So, I&#39;m rather content with this set. And that&#39;s about all I have to say.</p>
