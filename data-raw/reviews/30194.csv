First off, I really like the build of the set. It&#39;s something very different to most sets of a similar style. Most movies that have only one Lego set to represent them show some sort of vehicle, or an insect and a small side build in the case of the original Ant-Man. However, this set instead features a very cool-looking transmission tower, and I like this change-up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures:</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s take a look at the minifigures.</p>

<p>Wonder Woman: This design of Wonder Woman looks very cool, featuring a solid gold design for her outfit this time around to represent the armour of a fallen Amazon, and I like this design change. The wings look awesome on her, and I love the way that her hair and helmet pieces are combined into one. Unfortunately, this set doesn&#39;t come with a separate hair piece, but I still think it looks awesome, and she still comes with the Lasso of Truth.</p>

<p>Cheetah: This iteration of the Cheetah is the best Lego version of her in my opinion. While I do think the CMF and Lex Luthor Mech Takedown versions are solid, this iteration is the best version to me, and that&#39;s mostly because this version looks the coolest to me. The white hair really works for her, and the use of a tan body as opposed to the yellow body for the Mech Takedown version or the CMF variant, which has a Cheetah costume that doesn&#39;t look as good, makes her look more like an actual Cheetah, which I like.</p>

<p>Maxwell Lord: As our first and so far only Lego Maxwell Lord, I think he&#39;s a bit weak design-wise in comparison to the movie. While the torso looks fine, the head&nbsp;looks a bit off when compared to what we&#39;ve seen of him for the movie so far. A better head for Maxwell could have been included. The hairstyle works for him, but the hair colour does not. The movie version seems to have a strawberry-blonde sort of colouring, so that could have been a better colour than dark brown. Despite these flaws, he&#39;s not a bad minifigure in my opinion. He could just use some work in the head and hair colour departments.</p>

<p>Build:</p>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve covered the minifigures, let&#39;s take a look at the build. The main build of the set is a transmissions tower. Since I haven&#39;t seen the movie yet, I do not know how this will factor into the story, but it will presumably be where the final battle takes place, or if not the final, then some other important battle in the story. Regardless, it is a very cool build. There is an area off to the left that can be used as a place to put minifigures for action scenes, but to the right is the heart of the build: the transmissions tower itself, and underneath that is a bunker. While the build offers close to nothing in regard to play features, there is one. At the back of the bunker is a tan dial. Spinning that dial will turn the satellite dish on the top of the bunker. There&#39;s some foliage off to the side, a spider just below it, and a connection point for a clear pole where you can pose a minifigure for more action scenes. The set also comes with a small camera for Maxwell.</p>

<p>Final Verdict:</p>

<p>This set is worth the money in my opinion. While not offering much with things to do in terms of play features, the minifigures alone are worth the money, especially Wonder Woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
