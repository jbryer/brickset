<p>This set contains 18 pieces giving it a price per part of 27c, and assuming the UK price would probably be &pound;4 if it was sold the price pr piece&nbsp;is 22p. This set contains three small builds to add to your Mario courses.</p>

<p>I reviewed the 71360 Adventures with Mario already, please read that review for more on how the Mario figure works:&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/57216"">https://brickset.com/reviews/57216</a>&nbsp;. Let&#39;s take a look at this small little set.</p>

<p><strong>Character</strong></p>

<p>There is only one character in this set and that is a Super Mushroom that is in two other sets, the 71366 Boomer Bill Barrage and 40414 Monty Mole and Super Mushroom. Made using the most pieces of the set.</p>

<p>The top of the mushroom is made using a new for Mario piece which is the size of 3x3x2 with a hollow inside. This new piece in read has 4 four large circles printed on all four sides and on the 2x2 stud space on top there is a 2x2 round tile that has the interactive sticker on. Holding in place the shell is a small build based on a printed 2x2 tan brick with the mushrooms face on. Hidden under the shell is a small build to get the shell at an angle this uses a hinging piece with a red stud to get it at the right angle.</p>

<p>When Mario jumps on the Super Mushroom Mario will get an extra health so if he falls in Lava, falls over or jumps on an enemy that could harm him he won&#39;t take any damage.</p>

<p><strong>Interactive elements</strong></p>

<p>Asides from the Super Mushroom there is also a Question block that is also seen in the 71360 Adventures with Mario and 71369 Bowsers Castle Boss Battle sets.&nbsp;This block has 1 of 6 options every time Mario steps on the interactive tile on the top. The tile is on a 2x2 printed brick with the Question Block printed on just two sides. Some of the 6 options include a Mushroom or extra coins or extra time.</p>

<p><strong>Other Build</strong></p>

<p>Finally, there is a small bit of terrain to extend the course this is made using a new 6x6 rounded blue plate with 4 1x2 nougat bricks holding a small 4x4 rounded green plate. There is also a clear stand to place the Question block on.</p>

<p><strong>App</strong></p>

<p>The instructions for this set, like most other Super Mario sets, are in the LEGO Super Mario app, but tbh the builds are so easy you could probably do it with just looking at the image. Once built it will show you how to use each interactive tile in the set&nbsp;and it will be added to you virtual collection on the app.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is a really nice little set, for $4 this is definitely something pick up for those course builders to get more Question blocks and super mushrooms. As a pre-order bonus it&#39;s just a nice addition, wish it was sold in the UK, so I could buy a few to extend my courses.</p>

<p>As the smallest of the expansion packs this is probably the worst as well as all the pieces are seen in other sets but as a GWP it&#39;s fine. As a set by itself without the Mario figure in mind this is an alright display piece if you change out the interactive tiles for some unstickered ones.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#39;t recommend this set to anyone who&#39;s not interested in the Mario course building idea as it really doesn&#39;t offer much outside of the course building system. For those building these sets for the system then this is a set to try get as you could buff up your interactive features with this set.</p>

<p><strong>Pros -&nbsp;</strong>Offers a great way to get the Mushroom who is in fairly pricey sets, decent value for the $4 price.</p>

<p><strong>Cons -&nbsp;</strong>Not a great set by itself really needs the 71360 to be a worthy purchase imo</p>

"lkb57","2021-04-18T15:07:29.21Z","A Must-Have Addition to your Super Mario Course","<p>This cute little set was a gift with purchase at brand stores and the online shop when the Lego Super Mario theme was first released. Luckily, since then it has been available at retail stores as a normal polybag purchase, so if you missed out on the GWP, you should still be able to grab several of them at your preferred local retailer.</p>

<h2>The Parts</h2>

<p>Obviously, the big attractions for this set are the mushroom and the mystery block. The new mushroom cap piece and the build for the mushroom perfectly capture the look of the mushroom power-ups from the video game. The mushroom&#39;s eyes and white spots are printed, and the action tile on the top features a factory-applied sticker.</p>

<p>Likewise, the Mystery block features a printed question mark and an action tile on top for Lego Mario to interact with. The use of the transparent pole to make the Mystery Block &ldquo;float&rdquo; above the ground is ingenious, and again nicely captures the video game look.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<p>As with most of the Lego Super Mario sets, the build is exceedingly simple. . . but for a $5 polybag, that is typical, and not really disappointing. Plus, the simple build is appropriate for the pixelated look of the Mario video games.</p>

<h2>The Final Verdict</h2>

<p>The mushroom power-up is one of the most common and most recognizable aspects of the Mario video games, so it&#39;s a little surprising that it doesn&#39;t appear in more of the Mario expansion sets. For that reason alone, I&nbsp;can&#39;t recommend grabbing this set enough. Grab two or three of these guys to add the super mushrooms into your courses. . . and just because they&#39;re a cute, fun little design.</p>

"Krutak","2022-10-28T07:49:42.837Z","Average Mario set (at least polybag)","<p>30385 Super mushroom Surprise is a first Lego Super Mario polybag, which started to sell in summer of 2020, when 1st wave of sets (including 71360 Adventures with Mario) launched.</p>

<p>The build features 6x6 rounded blue plate on which stands small island with 4x4 rounded green plate as grass. On grass, there&#39;s Super Mushroom. A ? Mark block floats above the water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I like a&nbsp;? Mark block in this set because it&#39;s positioned very neat. When my friend bought 71387 Adventures with Luigi, i wanted that one ? Mark block that floats neat&nbsp;above sand.</p>

<p>How about the gameplay: I suggest some changes to the gameplay</p>

<p>In games, you die when you touch lava. For that case, Super Mushrooms were created. I suggest, when Lego Mario touches lava, he dies immediately. This will stimulate players (at least me) to use stone builds, bridges, fruits, etc. Super mushroom will disappear when something other happens (i don&#39;t know what) and 1-up Mushroom gives you one-time shield from lava (maybe poison too!)</p>

<p>Never mind, back to set:&nbsp;30385 Super mushroom Surprise is a nice expansion to your Lego Super Mario world. I&#39;d rather use it for&nbsp;a&nbsp;? Mark block and decoration, because now Super mushroom doesn&#39;t give you coins at the finish (maybe). And, i have 1-up Mushroom, what&#39;s the function of the Super mushroom than! :(</p>
