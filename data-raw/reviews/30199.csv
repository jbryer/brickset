<p>I bought this as a Christmas present and companion piece to the Minecraft Dungeons game. Every year I try and persuade my son to wait until Boxing day before opening the Lego and so, in the morning he sat down ready to build. Whilst quite an adept builder this was probably the largest set he has tackled solo.</p>

<p>Packaging/Instructions: Mid size box, nicely depicting a scene with all the contents. The instructions, Book 1 for two figures, the table and small Golem; Book 2 for the remaining figures and larger Golem.</p>

<p>Bricks: Nothing too exciting but lots and lots of Red translucent bricks and plates.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build: Well, I wasn&#39;t required to help at all! Two blissful hours of concentration and my son had finished the entire build with only 1 minor challenge&nbsp;which was around some of the more repetitive elements of the large Golem which he worked out and remedied himself. I think personally I would have found the build slightly boring as it doesn&#39;t present a lot of variation, however, my son was fully engaged with the build and it was just at the right level to challenge him, and he&nbsp;is within the intended age group, not me!</p>

<p>Finished build: Just to reiterate, I&#39;m not a fan of Minecraft and it wouldn&#39;t be my choice of Lego, however, it is a great set. For the price you get an entire playset with 4 figures, a pig (a piggy bank I&#39;m informed) and two Golems with loads of accessories. The Golems are particularly striking with the mass of transparent red bricks and plates nicely balanced with the grey and printed parts (no stickers). They are also well articulated, solid and well balanced so they can stand and manage lots of poses. Importantly they are excellent for play.</p>

<p>Overall: I&#39;m really impressed with this set, unlike a lot of the Minecraft sets even I can see what these are and its an impressive build which my son enjoyed building and loves playing with. Heartily recommended and I consider good value for such a range within a set.</p>

<p>The building experience got boring after some time. The parts are great due to some unique pieces. The price is absolutely worth it, due to having $50 worth of bricks in a $40 set. The playability could&#39;ve been higher, but is average due to the Redstone monsters not having much movement due to being extremely blocky.</p>
