As the set 1631, it was sold only the set, but as this (1422), it was a promotional, sold with sweets, in Japan and in some stores (but not in Lego S@H).

This small set really looks like to be a promotional due to the basic size and not much building involved. The car at tha first view looks like good for a cart, but still very basic. The wheels are small gray pieces that connects in the pieces of the back and of the front of the cart. 

The base is a small plate that occupates all the space of the cart, and it have a decent size for it. In the back, a gray pieces connects a stick to put in the top of it a camera, what shows at least a bit of accuracy with an original.

The color scheme is basically gray and yellow (about the vehicle), with some few black details. In the front a semi circular piece increases itm and this piece have two studs at the top. About the vehicle, it still good, but much, really much basic. It could be increased with maybe different wheels (bigger than these), or with a different plate used as the base, to have more space for the minifigure, and to moves the camera better than it moves actually.

The minifigure is really useful, and have nice, no much simple or detailed, but a basic body with printed details. Also, it have a cap.

Overall, this set is small but worth a price of a impulse set at least, or less. The building could be a bit better, but the color scheme and minifigure are great, also about the design, it shows at least an accuracy with an original camera cart. So, it gets a 4 out of 5. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
