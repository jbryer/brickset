"DBrick","2020-09-05T17:09:32.31Z","Amazing set for an almost forgotten spaceship","<p>To be honest, this set looked so amazing that I had to buy it. Not only because is one of the OT spaceships (despite that it&#39;s one that is only shown 1 or 2 minutes), but else because it looks AMAZING.</p>

<p>Seems like a space Ferrari and&nbsp;has a size that fits almost everywhere (not like the Falcon).</p>

<p>Building process is not so complicated. It took me 3 hours to build it, with some errors I needed to unbuild and rebuild. You can watch the full process video time lapse <a href=""https://todobrick.com/analisis-lego/lego-75275-ala-a-ucs/"" target=""_blank"">here</a>&nbsp;(I have started to recording my builds, and the result looks awesome).<br />
<br />
Until I build the Razor Crest (75292) I think is my favorite 2020 set.</p>
