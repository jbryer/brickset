<p>Hey there, Captain Mutant here.</p>

<p>When it came time to order the exclusive sets that can normally only be purchased from the LEGO House in Billund, a promo code became available which allowed you to get a free polybag.&nbsp;</p>

<p>My hunch is that this polybag was a random one, and I ended up with set 30498, the Easter Bunny.</p>

<p>As you&rsquo;d expect from a polybag, the build is simple and there are no complicated steps. The 43 pieces all slot in easily, and the end result is something that definitely looks like a rabbit - even its ears can move somewhat.</p>

<p>Although I have to question the choice to name it an &ldquo;Easter Bunny&rdquo;: there are no indications that it is it remotely connected to Easter aside from the fact it was released in April; it doesn&rsquo;t even come with eggs or some chocolate.</p>

<p>Instead, there&rsquo;s a little patch of dirt with a few juicy carrots sticking out of it.</p>

<p>The rabbit is cute, and the designer has made good use of large curved pieces to give it a more organic feel. I guess my one regret is that you can&rsquo;t turn the rabbit&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>It wouldn&rsquo;t have been hard to do - just add a 1x2 jumper plate under the head, and you&rsquo;re done. I feel it would&rsquo;ve added a little more interest to the end result.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m giving the Easter Bunny that doesn&rsquo;t really have anything to do with Easter, 2 tentacles (out of 4).</p>
