"zniesmaczony","2022-11-21T16:54:55.427Z","An astounding model with minor flaws","<p>I&#39;ve been a LEGO fan since I was a little kid, but not until the last few years I put my interest in the Technic motorcycles, and being a biker myself, I became a Technic motorcycles collector. The Ducati Panigale is my 17th in overall and 10th large-scale motorcycle model. It&#39;s the biggest motorcycle model so far, with 646 pieces it surpasses the 42063 BMW R1200 GS model by 43 bricks. In the box there were&nbsp;several standard LEGO plastic bags containing bricks, as well as a thick manual and a sticker sheet.</p>

<p>The model took me approximately 4 hours to build. Starting from the engine, by the frame, rear swing arm, ending with suspended wheels and fairings. The build was the most demanding of all I did, but not very hard. The info on the box states that it&#39;s a 10+ years model,&nbsp;however a typical 10-year old might have a problem cause at few steps, joining the model modules can be tricky and challenging, as well as it may require strong fingers. Nevetheless, the building process was&nbsp;very satysfying.</p>

<p>The model itself has a lot in interesting details, among which the best one is a 2-step gearbox with a neutral&nbsp;gear. The way of changing gears is exactly the same as in real motorcycles, from down to up we have 1-neutral-2 gear. And here&#39;s the first flaw of the model, when on the 1st gear, the sprockets interact very roughly and there isn&#39;t other&nbsp;way to change this than dissasembling the whole motorcycle chassis and engine cover which would be too time-consuming. Things get much better at gear 2, and on neutral the wheels run very smoothly - naturally because no sprockets are turning. The second and biggest to me flaw, is the&nbsp;lack of kickstand. In every other motorcycle there is one, while here the motorcycle stands on a typical rear paddock stand, which is very unstable and you need to turn the handlebar maximum to the left, otherwise it may fall over. It&#39;s not like with real motorcycle where you lift the rear wheel on the stand and&nbsp;the handlebar is straight. The model would&#39;ve been much better with the kickstand.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the model is a great set to build. It looks astonishing among other sets on the shelf. A true beauty. I hope LEGO will continue making motorcycle replicas, as they are really great, especially for a die-hard motorcycle fan like me.</p>

<p>The build is good fun and relatively complex and tricky in parts so surprised me it was just 10+. Some juicy parts are in there (I was asking throughout what the 2 red minifigure ninja swords were for)</p>

<p>The gearbox is a good fun to build and see it working and unique to any technic model I have done before. I was quite careful in the build (but lockdown has me exhausted) so for some reason the gearing for 1 and 2 seemed to be reversed. It may have been me but it reminded me of the mistake in the Porsche GT3.</p>

<p>It really is a good model and pleased with it. It does have some flaws which must be the spirit of Ducati within it. For me the 2 real issues I would change would be the windscreen, it&#39;s kind of milky&nbsp;misty and opaque-ish, when a slick shiny clear or smoked screen would look much better. Also (Maybe my mistake but I double checked) the paddock stand works and presents the model well... but you can&#39;t rotate the rear wheel when it&#39;s sat on it. Frustrating as that&#39;s kind of the point of them and should be an easy minor fix or design change. But that said: Buy it, it&#39;s awesome!</p>

"Duq","2020-06-21T14:10:21.893Z","Great bike, could have been better.","<p>Five years ago I ended my review of 42036, the previous Technic road bike, with:</p>

<p><em>I&#39;m already looking forward to 2020 for the next Technic road bike...</em></p>

<p>Well, here it is! 8420 in 2005, 8051 in 2010, 42036 in 2015... there&#39;s certainly a pattern. 8051 was the odd one out with a straight 3-cylinder engine, the others were V4 engines and so is this Ducati.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Of course you&#39;ll find a bunch of black and grey beams to create the frame and some red panels for the bodywork but there are some more interesting parts in this set.</p>

<p>Straight away you&#39;ll notice a new brake disc that, for now at least, is unique to this set. As it&#39;s modeled after the Ducati brake disc I&#39;m not sure it will be used in other sets. For the rear brake it&#39;s using the same part that the Bugatti and Lamborghini use, only it&#39;s light grey here.</p>

<p>The rear tyre is new, and while it&#39;s wider than the front tyre Lego calls it &#39;TYRE NARROW, DIA. 94.3, NO. 1&#39;, probably because it&#39;s not as wide as the rear tyre on the Harley.</p>

<p>A great new part is the shock absorber for the front forks. Since 1991&#39;s Shock Cycle most of the bigger Technic motorbikes have used the same shock absorber element with the exposed springs. They work, but don&#39;t look very realistic. The new element, in pearl gold here, looks like a modern upside-down front fork. It certainly feels more stable than the old part.</p>

<p>The last part to highlight is the windscreen. Not a traditional windscreen part but a soft transparent plastic sheet.</p>

<h3>Building</h3>

<p>I was expecting a page or two about the prototype at the start of the instruction booklet like some other licensed set have. The Lambo has 27 pages! Not so here. One photo of the real bike at the back of the book, that&#39;s it. So let&#39;s get started.</p>

<p>It&#39;s an interesting model to build. Like most Technic bikes there are angles everywhere. You start by building the frame. Then the gearbox goes in, followed by the V4 engine. At one point there&#39;s something I hadn&#39;t come across before: a QR code that links to a video on the Lego.com website, showing how the gears should be operating at that point.</p>

<p>Next the swing arm goes on, followed by the front forks, but no chain or rear wheel yet. Instead the next step starts the bodywork. With the box showing that the body panels can be removed from the completed model that&#39;s a bit strange. I would recommend after step 130 skipping to step 168, put on the rear wheel and build the stand. After step 183 you have the bike with two wheels sitting on the stand and that point you can go back to 131 and start putting on bodywork.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s first look at the aesthetics. Does it look like a Ducati Panigale? Yes it does. Is it close to a scale model? Err... no. There&#39;s a few things wrong. While the designers have done a pretty good job, the fairing at the front is too high and the bodywork too wide.</p>

<p>The position of the rear shock is mostly ok but the asymmetric&nbsp;mud guard looks strange. At the front the mudguard is missing altogether. Still, it&#39;s a good-looking modern racing bike.</p>

<p>Now let&#39;s look at the technical side. It&#39;s impressive to squeeze a gearbox into the available space so let&#39;s not complain about it only having two gears. Lever down for first gear and up for second gear is correct for most motorbikes, but racing bikes tend to have the gears upside down. Also, unlike cars, the gear lever on a motorbike comes back to the centre position.</p>

<p>While the gearbox is nicely engineered, unfortunately there apparently wasn&#39;t room for a gear connection between the crankshaft and gearbox, so a rubber band is used instead. On a real engine that would be gears or a chain. Rubber bands or belts are only used for timing belts. Ironically it&#39;s Ducati of all brands that is known for using gears instead of belts for a more precise connection.</p>

<p>The last thing I want to mention is the stand. This is the racing version of the Panigale so it doesn&#39;t have centre stand or kick stand. Instead it comes with a paddock stand, like you&#39;ll see in various publicity shots. The way the bike sits on the stand is a little awkward but it&#39;s hard to see a better way. The real strange thing though is that while on the stand the rear wheel can&#39;t spin, so you can&#39;t play with/ show off the gears while on display.</p>

<h3>Final verdict</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a good-looking model of a motorbike with some nice new parts.&nbsp;Technically it&#39;s not perfect, but it&#39;s the first Technic motorbike with working gears. The price is reasonable; price per part is similar to the last few large Technic bikes.</p>

<p>So is the Ducati partnership worth it? Probably not. At the size/ scale of cars like the Porsche, Bugatti and Lamborghini you can create a very good model without compromising on the technical details. I feel that at the size of these bikes you would get a better model by focusing on the technical side and basing the looks on a generic motorbike rather than a specific prototype.</p>

"Jayneflakes","2020-06-30T08:46:12.563Z","I really wanted to like this one","<p>When I heard that Lego were releasing a branded Ducati motorbike, I was really excited, because it was technic bikes that got me back into Lego as an adult, when I became too ill to ride my real one. Sadly, this model looks far better on the box photos, than it does when built.</p>

<p>My pet hate is stickers, they never go on straight, they peel off over time and they do not always match the colour of the plastic. This model is covered in stickers, ranging from the huge fairing stickers, to a tiny seat sticker. I find them impossible to use and so I choose&nbsp;not to place them. Printed pieces may be fractionally more expensive, but they look so much better when the model is complete.</p>

<p>The engine and gear box of this machine are remarkably&nbsp;clever and both work well, but there are some issues. The engine is all but invisible rendering a gear box that changes the visible speed of the pistons all but useless&nbsp;and I wonder about the durability of running it on a rubber band.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The clever shaping of the fairing is beautiful, but it looks incomplete at the front wheel. There must have been a way to mould a front mudguard that clips onto the new front forks? The forks themselves look&nbsp;really good and seem far stiffer than the previous versions. The rear spring is the same as always and works perfectly. The single sided swing arm is inspired and works brilliantly, especially with the new hub with disk rotor. Again, the disk rotors on the front also look great, but the lack of brake calipers is really obvious. The wind screen on the top is a clever idea, but it fails to work well, leaving a large gap down the sides and looking rather cheap, no matter how much it is fiddled with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Finally, there is the paddock stand which in principle, should be a great idea, but in practice, fails once again. The wonderful wide rear&nbsp;tyre is too wide to fit into the stand correctly and does not balance&nbsp;well, so the bike falls over, making this a problem to display.</p>

<p>For MOC builders, this a nice set for the parts, but for actual modellers it is sadly lacking and does not look finished at the end. For me, the old 8051 Triumph street triple (even if not officially branded as such) is a prettier machine.</p>

"Hitscan","2020-08-20T20:59:27.323Z","Form, Function, Minor Flaws","<p>Lego has produced 39 Technic motorcycles in 41 years (35 if you exclude Robo Riders), and the Ducati Panigale is one of the best. It&#39;s also one of the most expensive, but the numerous exclusive elements and compact design justify that price.</p>

<p>Just like the real bike, Lego&#39;s rendition of the Penigale is beautiful. The&nbsp;front-wheel shock absorbers work flawlessly-&nbsp;and along with the new break disks-&nbsp;make the likeness to the real machine that much better.&nbsp;If there&#39;s one thing that detracts from accuracy, it&#39;s the large gap in the side fairings. Fully covering the sides would make the gear-shifting function impossible, but a couple short beams or system pieces could have covered some of that gap. Still, seeing some frame has a very Technic charm. The windshield is creatively formed with&nbsp;a thin vinyl piece skewered on two katanas.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0?ui=2&amp;ik=3ef590901f&amp;attid=0.1&amp;permmsgid=msg-a:r5689588888347672391&amp;th=1740d66882febdd7&amp;view=att&amp;disp=safe&amp;realattid=f_ke37r17r0"" style=""height: 832px; width: 1000px;"" /></p>

<p>While the Panigale&#39;s steering and&nbsp;suspension are functions shared by many Technic motorcycles of releases past, the true star of the show is this bike&#39;s three gears (first, neutral, and second). The gearbox fits into the frame nicely- all the space is utilized, and the end result is unlike any&nbsp;motorcycle Lego has produced. Changing gears has a noticeable effect on the speed of the pistons when the Panigale moves.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the four working pistons are largely obscured by the fairings, so although the two piston-moving speeds of the Panigale do exist, this&nbsp;functionality can be hard to get a visual of. This wouldn&#39;t be a problem&nbsp;if the upper side fairings covering the motor were easy to remove, but they&#39;re not.</p>

<p>Outside my nitpicking&nbsp;with the set&#39;s design, a couple of quality control issues reared their ugly heads while building. The single red pin/crank liftarm along with&nbsp;eight red axle and pin connectors (hub with 1 axle) came from a batch of plastic the color of which was noticeably darker than the rest of the set&#39;s red elements. Although none of these pieces are big enough to disrupt the visual cleanliness of the final product, it is a factory&nbsp;error I hope The Lego Group fixes. A much worse error appeared in the form of a black double-bent liftarm which had become a&nbsp;<em>triple-bent&nbsp;</em>liftarm due to an apparent molding mistake. It&#39;s unlike anything I&#39;ve personally experienced.</p>

<p>All said and built, the Ducati Panigale&nbsp;is a good set both aesthetically and functionally, and&nbsp;the&nbsp;minor problems barely hinder what is an impressive model. The build felt rewarding, and seeing it all come together was an overall great experience.</p>

"GrandInqusitor","2022-07-15T12:24:23.89Z","My 4th set and first motorcycle","<p>How many&nbsp;functions one relatively small&nbsp;technic motorcycle can have. All of them ! That real motorcycle would have</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building/Parts:</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;The building process is very well-thought-out you start from the frame and build fake moving engine and gearbox to that frame and add rest of motorcycle to it. Yes you heard it right it has working&nbsp;4 piston engine and 3 gear gearbox (2 speeds and neutral). In such a small body its truly well-thought-out build.</p>

<p>There is some interesting buildings techniques used that were new to me and this is first motorcycle for me, so I had lots of parts specific to motorcycles that I have never had before.</p>

<p>There are two pieces of katanas that you always eye and quite can&#39;t figure out how am I supposed to&nbsp;use in the build.</p>

<p><strong>Aesthetics</strong></p>

<p>I&nbsp;love the colour scheme, and it&#39;s quite similar to real Ducati, It&#39;s a very nice for displaying. Some of its panels are quite easy to remove, so you can have potentially 2 display modes, Naked and Regular.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>I think its quite playable model its easy to handle and is not too weak expect some panel&nbsp;pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Value for money:</strong></p>

<p>I think this is very good set for the money. It has everything a motorcycle would have and considering it&#39;s also a licenced set in my opinion its worth every penny.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>While I am not big Motorcycle fan in real life I absolutely loved to build one and seeing myself to get some other bikes to compliment this one. I will recommend&nbsp;this bike for everyone who are technic fans or Motorcycle fans. 5 out of 5&nbsp;</p>
