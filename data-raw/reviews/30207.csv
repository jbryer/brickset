However, the Ninjago Legacy magazine does something a bit different, where it includes two minifigures, instead of just one. Of course, that comes at a price, or rather a price increase. But is it worth it? Well, if you see my overall rating of this set, yes.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging</strong></p>

<p>The packaging of this set is very similar to the typical battle pack&nbsp;sets exclusive to the LEGO stores (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40374-1/Golden-Zane-Accessory-Set"">40374-1</a>, for example). On the front you can see some nice action shots of Lloyd and the Stone Warrior included. There is nothing on the back.</p>

<p><strong>Instructions and building experience</strong></p>

<p>The &quot;building process&quot; was very simple, since it&#39;s just two minifigures and Lloyd&#39;s sword is already assembled. It took me a couple of seconds to put together. Obviously, there are no instructions included.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Besides the minifigure parts, from which none are exclusive, the only other pieces included are Lloyd&#39;s golden sword and a red katana. Nothing interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Like I said, in this magazine gift we get two minifigures: Legacy Lloyd and a Legacy Stone Warrior.</p>

<p>Legacy Lloyd included is a very simple minifigure. While some may not like the lack of detail on him compared to&nbsp;other green ninja variants, I think that the simplicity is a good thing and it definitely reminds me of the original ninja suits, which the Legacy variants are meant to resemble. Lloyd has the Legacy style hood piece in green and dark green, which makes me wonder why it&#39;s included in a&nbsp;magazine gift and&nbsp;isn&#39;t in the&nbsp;$15 Lloyd&#39;s Journey set. Underneath his mask, he has&nbsp;two face expressions: one is angry/determined&nbsp;with teeth showing, while the other one looks happy/suprised. Legacy Lloyd also comes in sets 70664, 70670 and 70679.</p>

<p>The second minifigure is a normal Legacy Stone Warrior, who is meant to resemble the Stone Swordsman minifigure from 2013. Unlike Lloyd, this guy has a lot of very nice and intricate details, which look fantastic and are a great improvement compared to the original. Unlike the original, however, he replaces the dark grey with more black and the blue marks on his face are now yellow, which makes him look more like the Stone Scout. Legacy Stone Warrior is actually a bit rarer than Legacy Lloyd, as he comes in only one other set: 70669 Cole&#39;s Earth Driller.</p>

<p>For accessories, Lloyd has his golden sword from the S11 wave of sets and the Stone Warrior has a red katana.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, there aren&#39;t any play functions or stud shooters in this set, but I think that the conflict in a box aspect is well executed here since both figures&nbsp;have one weapon each and any kid can have lots of fun with just making Lloyd fight the Stone Warrior.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Overall, I think that this magazine gift is absolutely fantastic. Unlike in other Legacy magazines, both minifigures are uncommon and may be desirable for adult collectors. Since this one includes a good guy and a villain, the playability is also very good. I paid 20.00PLN for this one, (around 5 Euro), which is the same price as&nbsp;a CMF&nbsp;nowadays and is a phenomenal price for what you get here. I personally recommend this to any Ninjago fan, unless you already have both of these minifigures.</p>
