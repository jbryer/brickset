"Superfox86","2020-06-03T01:36:14.977Z","40407-1: Death Star II Battle","<p>40407 Death Star II battle is a gwp exclusive set that could only be obtained on shop.lego.com with purchases that exceed 75$/75&pound;/75&euro;, it&#39;s retail value was 20$.(This may the fourth promo was not available in stores because of the Covid-19 pandemic.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is no overall playability with this set as it is mainly display purposes, while I shouldn&#39;t say that there is no playability as you can have the A-Wing and Tie interceptor battle each other while the turret provides support.</p>

<p>It is a very simplistic yet appealing build to most people yet there are problems with the design, such as the tie interceptor&#39;s cockpit which is two small for the body and the A-wing is very clunky and annoying. While the ships are riddled with flaws,&nbsp;the landscape of the Death Star trench is superb in the way &nbsp;the designer built it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now that the promotion is complete the only way to get this set is through bricklink and eBay, but I would not recommend getting this set unless it is to finish off your collection.</p>

However, This is a cool free set and I enjoyed putting it together, though I wish there were more greebling.</p>

<p>The mini builds for the ships are fine. The TIE Interceptor looks great from the side, not so much from the front, because the cockpit is way too small. Personally, I like the A Wing. It is recognizable and more accurate than its predecessors. For what it is, the greebling is good, those reddish brown towers in the back look good and the turret is... OK.</p>

<p>Not the best May the 4th Promo for sure, but a solid one nonetheless.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-09-11T05:31:09.347Z","Death Star II???","<p>This was a free gift with purchase which I&#39;m reviewing now because I preordered the Razor Crest to get it. Since it was free you really can&#39;t complain too much, but I do have last years Hoth set (missed the Endor one) and this one is rather poorly designed in comparison.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now as a parts set it is fantastic, you will never find such a variety of tiny parts that can be used to decorate the surface of pretty much any Star Wars set, but at the same time they are tiny and wouldn&#39;t cost too much to purchase if you needed them. You do get one printed brick, a 2x4 tile with the Lego Star Wars logo on it and 2020 below it. Well you certainly can&#39;t blame Lego for the way 2020 turned out, but it is certainly a blight on an otherwise nice brick.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build is similar to last years sets but in this case almost the entire build is the beautifully detailed base which is built sideways. Aside from the fact it is sideways, it really is just simple stacking. The SNOT, which really is vertical, is simply used for details. The two ships are tiny and lackluster. Nothing like the wonderful AT-AT in last years Hoth set. One thing to look out for however, pretty much every brick is light gray and you need to distinguish between such similar bricks as standard 1x1s, 1x1s with a single stud on the side, two studs in the sides, and the old headlight bricks.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The model is attractive, minus the ships, but is it the Death Star? Sure, why not. I&#39;m sure it isn&#39;t accurate to any particular section of the Death Star, but it is believable that it could be. Now is it the Death Star II? I would say no, this more closely resembles the trench from the original Death Star in my opinion, minus the walls that actually made it a trench. In Return of the Jedi you will recall that the ships flew into the Death Star to blow up the core of it, and I feel this is a poor representation of that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The ships are certainly a disappointment. The A-Wing I suppose is as good as it can be at this scale, which is not very good. But the TIE is very lacking. The use of light gray to connect the wings instead of black is unacceptable. Furthermore, the cockpit is way too small, they should have used a 2x2 round plate instead of the stud with a hole in it. Doing this would have created a much better looking model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So what do you do with this set? I&#39;m tempted to buy the parts for a second base to make it longer, and then build up walls around it to turn into a trench. Microfighters May be a little too big to fly through it, but would certainly be more fun than the tiny, almost unrecognizable ships that came with it. Besides, I always wanted a trench set. However, if you didn&#39;t get this set with the promotion, I wouldn&#39;t worry about it, you aren&#39;t missing much.&nbsp;</p>

"TheBrickDudeStudios","2020-07-06T23:56:19.047Z","Review of the Death Star II Battle","<p>This is a lego Star Wars May the fourth promotion set. It has an A-Wing and a Tie Advanced. It is similar to the Endor and Hoth 20 year anniversary sets. The A-Wing is not that good they have made better ones but the Tie Advanced is even worse. It has too much light bluish grey&nbsp;and it has a clear stud even though they could&#39;ve used a clear dish piece with printing on it.&nbsp;</p>
