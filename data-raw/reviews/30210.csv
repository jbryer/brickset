It is highly collectible and sought after I suspect, really can&rsquo;t stress how great this set was to build and receive. And I sound a tad repetitive here, but we can move on now to discuss the rest of the set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This little box includes a nice stylized logo in the top with a shot of the car and Hot Rod underneath it. The model on the front is shown in all its glory, the back includes a nice continuing shot where we see what&rsquo;s happened after the driver has pulled into the garage for repairs.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">For a small GWP set there isn&rsquo;t a whole lot of parts which stand out for me, however that being said I will state we have a lot of dark blue elements as part of the main build. It isn&rsquo;t meant to be a parts pack though, it&rsquo;s clearly something designed more for the build.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Driver: Standard generic Minifigure design enhanced to the max, this character has swept back dark brown hair, a letterman style jacket printed on both sides, front and back of the torso for extra detailing, some printed legs with oil/grease stains from working under the hood and a pair of mirrored shades for that added cool factor. No hand held accessories.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Mechanic: Our lovely mechanic friend is dressed in overalls dark blue with a red shirt, includes some very impressive detailing with pocket full of pencils, oil stains and a dual-sided face with clean happy smile expression and dirty, oil covered working on the engine expression. Includes silver wrench and black LEGO hammer for tools and a ponytail cap combination which works great.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The instructions are easy to follow along with and very well designed. The build is pretty impressive for this model, I enjoyed this build it&rsquo;s very well executed and I like all of the detailing, the steps to build the engine model and the rear seating area is just pretty fun. Stickers are included for the license plate and some side signage, which just says Hot Rod.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This model is meant to emulate an older model from Model Team, in Minifigure Scale this is the Blue Fury, at least the original build of the model, the alternative model build is not included with this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Blue Fury was released in 1995, I did not own that set, but judging from the images in the Database this Minfigure Scaled version does quite a lot to capture the likeness, the only differences with this model are the lack of chromed elements for the exhaust tubing and the headlights. Using ordinary bluish gray parts is a necessary alternative since LEGO doesn&rsquo;t chrome parts these days.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">That being said this model is just all around perfect. It rolls well, looks great next to the Downtown Diner Modular set, or as part of a general LEGO Modular/City display, and it includes a whole lot of charm. Really good GWP.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Love this set. I would appreciate any sets that would take older models and transform them into Minifigure Scaled models for my Modular display. Or just because of how unique and creative it can be to downsize pre-existing ideas in this fashion. The Hot Rod AKA Blue Fury is all around highly impressive and a great little model, the Minifigures work well in this set and don&rsquo;t stand out when put next to others. Overall if you missed out on this I would <b>Highly Recommend</b> tracking it down, especially if you own the original Blue Fury, it makes a nice companion model/set to put alongside it as well.</p>
