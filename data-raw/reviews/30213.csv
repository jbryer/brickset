<p>This set is a pretty good Polybag, It is set 30370, it has 22 pieces and is recommended for ages 5+</p>

<h2>Minifig</h2>

<p>This set comes with one minifig and it is the diver.</p>

<p>He has a dual moulded helmet, It is mostly red but, the visor and the lights are trans-very light blue</p>

<p>He has a happy expression with no alternate expression.</p>

<p>He has a white oxygen tank, which is a pretty old piece.</p>

<p>His body is very detailed, with a lot of things like compasses and a belt, and a lot of other things that I don&#39;t know the name of. The back of his body is not as detailed, But it does have a few things that look like tubes.</p>

<p>His legs have some dark blue and gray printing, but other that they are pretty plain compared to the body.</p>

<p>He also has some res flippers that attach to fis feet.</p>

<h2>Sting ray</h2>

<p>The sting ray is a new piece for this year, it is in the color dark tan. It has blue dots and it&#39;s eyes for printing. Near the back it has two places that the diver can hold on to.&nbsp;I hope to see this piece in different colors in the future.</p>

<h2>Builds</h2>

<p>There are two builds in this set, They are the coal on rocks and the jet thing.</p>

<h3>Coal</h3>

<p>The coal build is simple, it is built on a dark tan plate. It has some rocks built with some slopes and a brick. It has a gold 1x2 tile and a coral piece in the color salmon.</p>

<h3>Jet</h3>

<p>The jet is also a simple build, The diver can hold on to it. It is mostly yellow, but there are some other colors mixed in.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In conclusion, This is a good Polybag, and I would recommend it. I think the main draw to this set is the new sting ray because it is the cheapest way to get it.</p>

"Odeinoichus","2020-12-19T19:16:00.2Z","Explore the Ocean Floor","<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Set #30370 Ocean Diver:</b> LEGO City re-introduces the Ocean Explorer Sub-Theme and we get some pretty awesome new underwater animal elements. As a bonus, all proceeds of sets purchased supports National Geographic in some fashion, from what I&rsquo;ve heard. This Polybag is awesome, it&rsquo;s one of the best, and here&rsquo;s why.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Pros:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Not a lot to build, but great parts.</li>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Includes new Coral Element and Stingray Animal.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Minifigure uses new diving equipment with air tanks and sculpted lights on top to see with.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Cons:</span></b></p>

<ul>
	<li style=""margin-left:8px"">Wasn&rsquo;t easy to find at retail.</li>
	<li style=""margin-bottom:11px; margin-left:8px"">Not a large model.</li>
</ul>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This is an excellent parts pack and a perfect way to amass an army of Stingray cheaply. That being said, it is a tad underwhelming when it comes to what you actually build. The scenery is nice, but relies too much on the lone coral piece and the mini-sub craft is a tad puny. I&rsquo;d recommend this set mostly to help support National Geographic and the parts, but the fun factor is still a little underwhelming compared to other Polybags. Recommended Cautiously.</p>

<p><strong>The Diver &amp; the Stingray</strong><br />
These are the main draw of the set and well worth it.&nbsp; The diver has a well-designed scuba suit with printing on the torso and legs.&nbsp; The diver helmet is a new piece introduced in this Nat Geo line and looks fantastic with the dual molded transparent visor and lights and solid red helmet.&nbsp; As you see from the picture, he also has an oxygen tank and flippers.</p>

<p>The stingray looks like a peaceful fish with his printed spots and eyes.&nbsp; This is a new mold and looks quite friendly compared the original <a href=""https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=30084&amp;idColor=11#T=C&amp;C=11"">black stingray</a> from sets released from 1997-2001.&nbsp; This new stingray also has two studs on the top so you can connect pieces if you&#39;d like.</p>

<p><strong>Building the reef and scuba scooter</strong><br />
Did you know the underwater propulsion units are called &quot;scuba scooter?&quot;&nbsp; I didn&#39;t until I googled the name for this review.&nbsp; The scuba scooter is an easy build with handlebars for the diver to hang on and a wheel rim for the rear of the propeller area.&nbsp; It&#39;s just the right size for the minifig.&nbsp; It&#39;s easy to build for the kids.&nbsp; The reef is also very easy to build and a little bland except for the new plant piece that is a nice coral pink color.&nbsp; The reef would look nicer with some more vegetation or a shell piece but that&#39;s where the imagination and the rest of your Lego collection come in.&nbsp; The gold 1x2 tile is the treasure you&#39;re searching for and a great reward.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br />
I highly recommend this polybag set for the diver and stingray alone.&nbsp; They are both really great designs and make this another polybag worth the value.&nbsp; The set also includes a new coral plant and a gold bar which are nice pieces as well.&nbsp; This set will played with for hours by any child.&nbsp; In the US, this polybag was originally only available at Lego brand stores (which I missed out on because of the pandemic) but it was available during Christmas toy displays at Walmart stores which is how I got my copy.&nbsp; Hopefully it stays available for some time.</p>

<h3 style=""margin-top:19px; margin-bottom:6px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Intro</span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Polybags can either have some rare pieces or be just another excuse for space on the shelves. Does this simply named set have a complex set up or is it just a waste of time and money?</span></span></p>

<h3 style=""margin-top:19px; margin-bottom:6px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Minifigure</span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The lone diver in this set has intricate printing from head to toe, making his suit quite realistic. His flippers are exceptionally red. Likewise, his brand new helmet pops out and features sleek, double-molded lights. This is supported by the air tanks in the back. Although, white does not fit with the suit and red tanks should have been present. However, I praise the design of the diver.</span></span></p>

<h3 style=""margin-top:19px; margin-bottom:6px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Completed Model</span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The diver&rsquo;s only means of transportation is a water scooter. Its compact build looks realistic and has good color choices for all of the parts. I wish a water accessory had been included though.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The recent coral color has returned to propel the single coral piece forward. The shaping is brilliantly executed and holds its own, despite being the only decoration. The rock build is fitting and the gold brick reminds us of the treasure the diver is after. I would have liked the more detailed ingot piece, though. Thankfully, the best part of this polybag pardons any problems.</span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The stingray is excellent. There are many antistud points on its base to ensure a perfect display can be made. The exquisite dark tan color choice is not only crisp, but also pops more than the possible alternative of dark stone gray to depict this creature. The dots on the back are numerous and extravagant. I could not have asked for more. There are even studs on top for the diver to surf on. The stingray is certainly the best part of the polybag. It couldn&rsquo;t be better!</span></span></p>

<h3 style=""margin-top:19px; margin-bottom:6px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Overall</span></span></h3>

<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">I have collected Lego since 2013. Over that time, TLG has vastly expanded its themes, sets, and parts. This set proves that. My love for Lego has also expanded during that time. However, I will be moving on from Lego now. Do not get me wrong, I have not stopped loving Legos. I just believe my collection is complete. I will be selling the sets that do not fit, but keeping most of them for my kids and maybe even their kids. I firmly believe a childhood should have Legos. This set will definitely be kept. The stingray and price make it a proper purchase. The only problem with the polybag is obtaining it. I had a hard time getting this set, even on the aftermarket. Best of luck if you wish to buy it and best of love to my favorite collection, Lego. </span></span></p>
