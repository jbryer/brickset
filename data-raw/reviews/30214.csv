<h2>Packaging/Instructions</h2>

<p>The&nbsp;box is decent, showing all the builds and the stud shooters in action. There is a small inaccuracy, as Bob is holding the hammer backwards, although this was corrected on&nbsp;the back. Speaking of the back of the box, it shows the stud shooters firing again, but also shows the gate lifting and the armor on the bike...lifting?</p>

<p>There are four bags. The first bag contains parts for Monkie Kid, the Cloud Board, Bob, and Snort. The second bag contains Mei and part of the White Dragon Horse Bike and the thirds bag finishes up the bike. The fourth bag contains the Bull Clones&#39; Hideout.</p>

<p>The first instruction booklet is 55 pages and contains no advertisements. I like the artwork of Monkie Kid at the bottom showing you how far you are in the booklet. The second booklet contains only 35 pages and has advertisement for the first wave of&nbsp;Monkie Kid sets.</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>There are four minifigures in this set, Monkie Kid, Mei, Snort, and Bob.</p>

<p>Monkie Kid uses his regular&nbsp;pieces, but uses a head only found in one other set, so far. Mei also uses regular pieces and has hair that you can switch with the helmet. Snort and Bob are identical, except for their weapon choice and Bob&#39;s bent horn. They use the normal Bull Clone Pieces.</p>

<h2>The Build</h2>

<h3>The Cloud Board</h3>

<p>This was the main reason I bought this set. :p It&#39;s a great build and the only con I can think of is that it&#39;s not symmetrical.</p>

<h3>The Dragon Horse Bike</h3>

<p>The main build of this set. It looks good, but I hate that you have to make the minifigure lay down a bit for them to ride it.</p>

<h3>The Bull Clones&#39; Hideout</h3>

<p>This is a weird build. It could be expanded a bit, but I don&#39;t know what to add. The skeleton skull adds a nice touch to the prison, but otherwise, this isn&#39;t really good. What is the gate for?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Overall Opinion</h2>

<p>This is a great set, but it kind of ruined by the Bull Clones&#39; Hideout. It is also a tad bit overpriced. If Lego added another section, it would be great, depending on what they add.</p>
