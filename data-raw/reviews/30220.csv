"Meadius","2020-05-23T15:48:23.96Z","Giving Voltron a Run for its Money","<p dir=""ltr"">When Monkie Kid was first revealed (a few weeks prior to its official reveal that is), I was a bit skeptical of the sets. Most of them just didn&rsquo;t appeal to me much, from what I could tell. One that did stand out to me was the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/80012-1/Monkey-King-Warrior-Mech"">80012-1: Monkey King Warrior Mech</a>. While a lot of people seem to be tired of mechs (understandably so, considering we&rsquo;ve been getting quite a few of them every year for quite a while now), I personally still enjoy them a great deal. When the official pictures came out, they sealed the deal, and I decided to buy it.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The Minifigures</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">This set features six minifigures. First up are Jia and An. While I appreciate getting civilian figures in action themes, they&rsquo;re just made up of old parts, so they aren&rsquo;t too exciting. Next up is one of the Bull Clones, named Growl but identical to most of the others available across the range of sets. He looks nice enough but I don&rsquo;t love the design, I&rsquo;d say its just OK. General Ironclad is just a cooler Bull Clone. While I still don&rsquo;t love him, he does look pretty cool, and I&rsquo;m always a sucker for cool swords. Monkie Kid is included in this set as well as all of the others. I think he looks great, and I like the new headphone part that goes around his neck (I need some of those in other colors). I&rsquo;m not sure exactly how common this variant is, since he has two different heads and two different torso and leg sets that are used across the theme, but he isn&rsquo;t hard to get a hold of. Last is the exclusive Monkey King, though he is quite similar to the one from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71025-0/LEGO-Minifigures-Series-19-%7BRandom-Bag%7D"">71025-0: LEGO Minifigures - Series 19</a>. In fact, the minifigure himself uses all the same pieces except for his armor, but with new prints. I like the design a lot, though I might still prefer the one from Series 19. His staff is also similar to the other Monkey King&rsquo;s, but this one uses metallic gold for the ends instead of pearl gold, and features the new lightsaber hilt-esque piece introduced in Monkie Kid, making this one superior in my opinion.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The Builds</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The first thing I noticed about this set as soon as I had it was just how massive it is. The box alone was huge, and the completed set itself is quite large. While the Monkey King Mech is undoubtedly the main attraction, this set contains a whopping for side builds. First up is the small Bull Clone mech, piloted by none other than Growl (yes, I did have to go check his name). This mech is pretty simple, with all the articulation coming from Mixel joints. I like the incorporation of the Metalbeard beard piece, even if it isn&rsquo;t as smoothly incorporated as it is in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/80010-1/Demon-Bull-King"">80010-1: Demon Bull King</a>. The next part built is the Monkey King&rsquo;s cloud. The build is simple but it looks good and something about it is charming. The largest of the side builds is the building, which contains both a kitchen and a small bedroom. While it is cramped, I appreciate the building&rsquo;s inclusion and on the whole I think it actually looks good for what it is. The building also contains a play feature, that being that the wall of the second floor pops off when you turn a pipe on the front of the building. It&rsquo;s functional enough, though I thought it was funny that nearly the exact same feature, down even to the build of the removable wall, is also present in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/76108-1/Sanctum-Sanctorum-Showdown"">76108-1: Sanctum Sanctorum Showdown</a>. The last side build is the small mountain section, though it&rsquo;s more of a small incline than a mountain. Nonetheless, I like the peach tree, even if it bothers me that it uses grey wrenches to attach the peaches, which are printed versions of the new (I think?) heart pieces.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">The main attraction is of course the Monkey King Mech and it is a real showstopper. Compared to every other mech I own (which is somewhere around 15), it towers over them, barring only<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70676-1/Lloyd-s-Titan-Mech"">70676-1: Lloyd&#39;s Titan Mech</a>, which it is still a good bit larger than, and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/21311-1/Voltron"">21311-1: Voltron</a>. While Voltron is a bit larger, the Monkey King Mech is still quite large compared to it. Additionally, the Monkey King Mech has some major advantages over Voltron: it can actually fit a minifigure (a minor thing, but it adds a lot for me) and poseability. Voltron is so massive that only a limited amount of very strong joints were used, as to make sure that it can support its own weight. While I find Voltron impressive in its own right, what this means is that the Monkey King Mech, which is a little bit smaller, is able to be much more poseable with its array of moving joints. There is a distinct lack of bendable knees on the Monkey King Mech, but I guess you can&rsquo;t win them all, and really I&rsquo;m not sure how large they would need to be able to be to support the weight of the mech and still be able to move. Another really cool touch with this mech is the use of painted gold elements. Every gold piece in this set, barring the Monkey King&rsquo;s armor (which is still pearl gold I think), is metallic gold, giving the mech a brilliant luster. It really does blow other sets that use a lot of pearl gold out of the water in my opinion. Last but not least, we get to perhaps my favorite part of the entire set; the back. Lego mechs generally don&rsquo;t have a very good looking back, for a variety of reasons: most of the detail is put towards the front, there&rsquo;s only a limited number of parts for the set, the back contains mechanisms that help support the mech or otherwise enable one of its features. The Monkey King Mech circumvents this by using a cape and plastic sheet pieces to cover up all of the ugliest and incomplete-looking areas, and the result is fantastic. I would go so far as to say this mech sets a new standard for future mechs in terms of concealing bad-looking sections, though I expect this is going to be more of a one and done deal.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Criticisms</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">While I enjoyed building this set, it does have some problems. Like most Lego mechs, the building process can get repetitive, since you have to build most sections twice. This is especially tiresome in this set, considering both its size and the amount of side builds. I assume they didn&rsquo;t intersplice the side builds with the main build because they didn&rsquo;t want to confuse kids (and adults), but some parts were just too monotonous. I also feel that the minifigure selection should have been improved. Most Ninjago sets in the $100-$130 price range have eight minifigures these days, so seven or eight minifigures seems reasonable to me, for a $150 set. Six minifigures would be fine if they were all unique or at least well detailed, but two are made from City parts and the Bull Clones come in every set. Ironclad and Monkey Kid are fine but both come in multiple sets, leaving the Monkey King as the sole exclusive. Even then, he still kind of feels like a variant of the Monkey King from CMF Series 19. I&rsquo;m fine with minifigures being easy to obtain, but if Lego wants to do that, I wish they&rsquo;d at least make them a little better looking. My last issue is the side builds. While the Monkey King Mech itself is perfect as is in my opinion, I think it might have made more sense for there to just be one or two side builds and have them be a bit larger. I would probably have used the parts from the Bull Clone mech (which is my least favorite of the builds) to improve the not-mountain.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">Overall</p>

<p dir=""ltr"">I have some issues with this set, but none of them pertain to the main attraction; the Monkey King Mech. It&rsquo;s quite frankly one of, if not the best, Lego mech ever made, giving even Voltron (my current favorite) a run for its money. It&rsquo;s big, beautiful, poseable, the whole nine yards. I like the side builds too, even if the mini mech and mountain weren&rsquo;t great. And while the minifigure selection could be improved, what you get is perfectly serviceable and still alright. In terms of price, I think this set is probably worth it. Ideally it would be $10-$20 cheaper, but I think the rare metallic gold pieces, which are in abundance here, as well as a good price-to-piece ratio make up for it, even if the paint on one of my metallic gold parts was faded (or maybe just not painted right). While it is unfortunate that this set will likely never go on discount, I find that it is worth the $150, even if just barely. In all honesty, my complaints pale in comparison to the majesty of the Monkey King Mech. I think it truly is a fantastic edition to anyone&rsquo;s collection, either with or without other Monkie Kid sets.</p>

"darthnorman","2020-07-27T13:38:19.667Z","Pure Gold","<p>This mech is a real beauty!</p>

<p>First, you start of building the small bull-themed mech, which is decent but lacks leg movement a bit. You can however modify it a bit to give the upper legs more space to articulate. The little mech is your main antagonist in this set and comes with two more or less generic bad guys and their weaponry.</p>

<p>Next up is Pigsy&#39;s nudle shop, a wonderful, yet small kitchen with a similar sized apartment on top. The shop includes everything you need: oven, sources, a menu, a pan and even a fire extinguisher. The apartment seems to be Monkey Kid&#39;s sleeping space. There&#39;s a cute Monkey King poster on the wall and there is room for additions, if you have spare parts. Two random people are added to the scene, maybe they are MK&#39;s parents? Who knows. On the roof there is a big sign, similar to that containers on the big ship (80013), and some plants. One figure can stand on the roof.</p>

<p>The other part of that building is a small arcade, which you can modify again, since the small lever doesn&#39;t do much... The utility pole looks great and holds a sign for Pigsy&#39;s shop.</p>

<p>Overall a great city scene, which could be expanded by adding the Panda shop from 80011.</p>

<p>Monkey King on his cloud is the next sub assembly, I love this figure and the cloud looks like it is flying him through the sky. The tip of flower fruit mountain, which holds the powerful staff, is included as well. The printed heart-shaped tiles look wonderful, I bet the Monkey King eats one of those every once in a while.</p>

<p>Last but not least there is Monkey King&#39;s Warrior Mech. A huge red and gold colored, ape like mechanical beast. Seriously, it is big, not as big as Voltron but bigger than Lloyd&#39;s Titan Mech. It features the most gold drum lacquered pieces in a single set, ever. And it shows! The color combination used here is just beautiful, the gold pieces shine as bright as they do on the images. Unfortunately it is not as flexible as you&#39;d wish. Let&#39;s talk about the bad things first: No knees - as you would expect. Ball joints were used though, but only to achieve a certain angle. They are hold in place by two mixel ball joints at the back. The torso can&#39;t be rotated and the arms&#39; up and down movement is quite limited.</p>

<p>Apart from that, the mechs arms and hands have a good range of motion. You can rotate the arms and hands 360 degrees, you have 4 fingers on each hand and small golden armor pieces form the pauldrons.</p>

<p>The head can be rotated and angled up and down, which is very well done and much-needed! You can also give the mech some emotions by rotating the 1x1 printed tiles used for its eyes. The red &quot;antennas&quot; can be moved around and angled in every direction, they are on small ball joints. There is of course a very cool cockpit inside its chest, that is integrated perfectly. The big staff can be used with both hands, or scaled down to fit into one hand. The rudimentary backside is covered with a soft, lightweight cape. Flags with Chinese signs are mounted on the back. Small details are added everywhere, so are stickers to complement the mechanical look.</p>

<p>All the beauty comes with a cost: You shouldn&#39;t play with it too much. It is big and heavy and parts will fall off. Also the golden colored pieces will lose their color once they hit other pieces too hard. So the big mech is more or less a display piece. You will admire it, though, while it stands majestically on your shelf.</p>

<p>You can play with the smaller stuff, especially the building is great for playing out scenes around the nudle shop that is attacked by the bull mech. Also, MK&#39;s journey to meet the real Monkey King and to get the staff offers great play value.</p>

<p>Verdict: I recommend this set to everyone who likes building mechs and displays them. Everybody collecting gold drum lacquered pieces, this is for you! The side builds are great for kids and can be modified easily to increase the fun.</p>

<p>Possible improvements: Add in more bad guys (at least one) and exchange one of the random civilians with Mei or Pigsy.</p>

"Padmewan","2020-09-23T22:51:04.257Z","Beautiful display piece, bad toy","<p>As a child in the 80s, I spent significant time living in Taiwan and frequenting Asian shops in the U.S. After completing the main build, I had flashbacks to the toys that I coveted, but rarely owned, from my childhood:&nbsp;the red-and-gold color scheme, the chunky moving parts,&nbsp;the intricate decorations and details. At the same time, the completed Mech is also much bigger, made of much higher-quality plastic... and much more fragile.</p>

<p>The Monkey Mech&#39;s lack of poseability has been covered extensively in other reviews; that weakness cuts not just into the piece&#39;s display value, but even more so into its play value. It has also the challenges of a constraction -- not quite enough articulation, difficult to balance, sometimes wonky --&nbsp;just more so due to its massive bulk. Many of the intricate decorations on the model sit at spots where they&#39;re likely to pop off with even light pressure -- particularly the (new! exciting!) gold plates on the shoulders and ankles, and the red lanterns dangling off the back of the knees.</p>

<p>I&#39;m particularly upset that the giant golden staff, or&nbsp;<b>?????</b>, has connection points that are too long for the Mech&#39;s arm/hand positions. I think they were forced to use a&nbsp;32M axle to hold the middle section together so the staff would look like a single solid object, not joined in the middle as they&#39;d likely have to do if they used shorter axles. That&#39;s a shame, as shorter axles would also let the Mech hold the staff with one hand. (The&nbsp;<b>???</b>&nbsp;is so iconic that considerable box space is devoted to the fact that you can shrink it&nbsp;by removing this middle section. If that doesn&#39;t sound like much of a play feature, it&#39;s because... it&#39;s not).</p>

<p>Sun Wukong himself shows up in this set on his magical cloud. The cloud looks great, but I found it paradoxical how heavy the build was: it&#39;s a solid chunk of dense bricks. Unlike the mechanical monkey, though, it&#39;s not too heavy to stand up, and is even moderately swooshable.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong: the Mech is beautiful; it&#39;s just not a great toy. What cinches that judgment for me is that the sidebuild enemy bull mech is, in my hands, much more fun. Like the best Mixels, you can express so much character by manipulating the limbs. In fact, I might just go and retrofit some Mixels now, into &#39;Mechs...</p>

<p>The noodle shop is great. I stuck it next to my New Year&#39;s Festival Temple, where it looks totally authentic. The streetscape sidebuilds are easily this series&#39; best feature. It&#39;s telling that in a set this big, the feature that gives me the most delight are the 4 little pieces that create soy sauce and sriracha sauce bottles sitting on the shop&#39;s counter.</p>
