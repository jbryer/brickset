I do like some of the figures and there are a lot of new pieces in it that I don&#39;t have other then that, that&#39;s all I can think off</p>

<p>The Bad stuff. I didn&#39;t really like the way the bridge was done for the big fig I thought I was to skinny at the bottom, I think the walkways along the side are too thin and I wish the all the containers had a door to them. I also didn&#39;t like the way the ship opened up it just felt awkward for me and the front kept breaking all the time</p>

<p>i really do regret buying this set and wish I got something else, this won&#39;t last very long on the self. Might get replaced by the Harry Potter Hogwarts sets</p>
