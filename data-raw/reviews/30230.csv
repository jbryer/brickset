There&#39;s no build since it&#39;s a parts pack, so let&#39;s look at the parts. There are quarter circle tiles in flame yellowish orange and medium azure, and round tiles in blue and coral, which are all good and useful but not particularly exciting. The standout here is the round tile in opalescent trans-clear, which is unique to this set, although the space-themed bracelet also included a gem piece in the same color. These pieces have a somewhat frosted look with some fine bluish glitter within, and I think they&#39;d be a great piece for an alien&#39;s eyes or drool, or just to look nice. Finally, there are 11 random printed square tiles in white, dubbed surprise charms by the packaging. These are all vibrant and interesting, and kids will definitely love them. I&#39;m not personally that interested in the ones with little positive messages on them, but there are some nice paint drip designs and a geometric one I quite like, and luckily the packaging has a clear front to let you shift the pieces around so you can guarantee you&#39;ll get a package with whatever print you&#39;re looking for. As for value, you&#39;d be paying $4 for 110-116 pieces (20-21 each of the unprinted tiles, and 11 printed). That&#39;s a fine enough price, although of course I wouldn&#39;t complain if they were a buck cheaper, and these would serve as a nice supplement to any dots collection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It is very simple to open the packaging for this set and there is no additional packaging inside and there are no instructions.</p>

<p>Stickers and Prints</p>

<p>There are no stickers in this set but the printed elements are awesome.</p>

<p>Playability</p>

<p>There is no real playability in this set but it does inspire you to make your own patterns with these parts.</p>

<p>Value</p>

<p>The value of this set at&nbsp;&pound;3.99 / $3.99 / &euro;3.89 is not&nbsp;bad. Many people may think it is over-priced because the set is just various one-by-ones but really it is not too bad because the prints make up for it.</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>This set is not amazing but it is worth buying at the right price. This theme is definitely targeted towards girls and it is nice to see the LEGO Group do more of that.</p>
