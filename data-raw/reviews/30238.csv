I was also intrigued by the new cape pieces which attach to Batman.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall Experience</strong></p>

<p>This is a fun, playable set, Batman fits in perfectly, and although there is no large wing pieces on this Batmobile, you can have really&nbsp;<em>play&nbsp;</em>with this Batmobile, it is sturdy, and durable, and no parts are going to fall apart easily.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The same can be said for the Joker&#39;s trike, I loved the Batmobile set from 2019, but it was sadly lacking in a vehicle for the Joker, and this does a good job, but I might have preferred a modified car as opposed to a trike with an opening mouth feature.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Robin Cycle is a standard motorcycle, but I am glad for its inclusion, and the inclusion of mid legs for Robin is a welcome change. Although I like the Robin minifigure, we did get various versions of this same Robin just last year, I am wondering if we will ever see Tim Drake&#39;s Red Robin at any point in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Play Features</strong></p>

<p>The Batmobile includes 2 forward mounted stud shooters, which work as per the norm, and are seemingly a must in any Batmobile. The Batmobile also includes a &quot;removable engine&quot; feature, which I remain torn on. On the one hand it is a new and interesting feature, but on the other hand it is space which could have been used for extra seating for a mini figure. I believe personally that kids may prefer the extra space for a mini figure to sit.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Joker&#39;s trike includes an opening mouth feature that opens and closes as you roll it, this works perfectly fine, although you cannot fit a minifigure inside the mouth so this is more for aesthetic than play value. It also includes a 6 stud shooter on the side which can be rotated around. This I find is a good play feature and gives you variety in play to fire in a multitude of directions. My favourite part about this build however is the ability to seat both the Joker and Harley Quinn on the trike.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>This set includes 4 minifigures: Batman (rebirth suit mk2), Robin (Damien Wayne), The Joker and Harley Quinn. All of these minifigures I find are a great inclusion and the printing on all is fantastic. To my knowledge this is the same Batman and Joker we had from the previous Batmobile set, but these are great minifigures and this would be a great set to get if you missed out on that. The Harley Quinn is new and is a great Harley to get if you have not owned one before, and the Robin is the same as 2019&#39;s but with the inclusion of mid-legs.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>This set stands at &pound;44.99 in the UK. Both vehicles are sizeable and the inclusion of 4, good minifigures is nice. If you missed out on the previous Batmobile set I would recommend a buy for this one. This to me feels like a new jumping on point for kids new to the Lego Batman theme, and I appreciate its intentions. The price of this set I think is worth it, and ticks all of the boxes that you would want it to with a lego Batman set.&nbsp;</p>
