"Zac","2021-05-31T06:52:34.65Z","Pastel rococo","<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The Friends line has benefited from a degree of architectural distinction in recent years, and 41427 Emma&rsquo;s Fashion Shop caught my eye with its restrained, pastel rococo style. Inside, the set offers a bevy of attractive pieces and designs, and intriguing play possibilities.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">The shop&rsquo;s exterior proves as impressive in person as in photographs. The diagonal glass entryway on the left and the balcony above it complicate the symmetrical, classically inclined central portion of the fa&ccedil;ade, with its pairs of windows, columns, and Ionic orders. At the top, paired gables in dark blue set off the archers and curves in pale yellow. The white balustrades, flowers, and Ionic orders lend the fa&ccedil;ade a sculptural quality. The bay windows and awning of the lower floor balance the recessed windows and concavities of the upper. While building I was delighted by the clever brick-built dress, tape measure, and scissors that serves as the shop&rsquo;s sign.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">To allow for play, the upper floor lifts off the lower. The lower floor features clothes and accessories for Emma and Andrea to try on. Each of the four torsos&mdash;two for the friends, two on display&mdash;sports detailed and characterful prints, and can be combined with what Lego describe as &ldquo;textile skirts.&rdquo; The first is coated in a smooth, shiny gold on one side, and is black on the reverse; the second is a textured fabric somewhat like poplin with a satin-like sheen. They may be attached either between the legs and torso, as apparently intended by Lego, or between the torso and head. I prefer the latter, making them capes rather than skirts, especially a cape seems suitable for Andrea, a popular musician. The rotating changing room functions well, or would were I to apply the sticker; lacking a curtain the purpose of the changing room seems to be defeated.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">Although the prospects for dressing up are impressive on the lower floor, I prefer the builds and play possibilities of the upper. The sewing machine is an outstanding model, and makes good use of a black lipstick. Emma can make use of two spools of thread, a pair of scissors, and an extra piece of the gold fabric. Alternatively, she and Andrea can visit over a cup of tea and make use of the turquoise couch.</span></span></span></p>

<p style=""text-align:start""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""font-weight:normal""><span style=""white-space:normal"">41427 is my first and to date only proper Friends set, and I am impressed by the quality and playability of the mini-dolls, by the shop&rsquo;s design, and by the gentle, open-ended ethos of the set. Four stars.</span></span></span></p>
