<p><strong>Build: </strong>The set&#39;s build was simple and only took me a few minutes.&nbsp; The pieces are very nice and fairly rare.&nbsp; It has a good collection of interesting pieces that can be put to good use in other situations.&nbsp; I dislike the blue pin on the black disk you hit, but other than that (and a pink piece that just barely shows through) I&#39;m not unhappy with the colors.&nbsp; The spinner&nbsp;looks very nice and the pieces that fall away are&nbsp;good-looking.</p>

<p><strong>Playability:</strong> The spinner works okay... the placement of the (ugly) blue rubber band prevents the spinner from &ldquo;bursting&rdquo; open the entire time.&nbsp; It also requires quite the slam in order to&nbsp;&ldquo;burst&rdquo; open in the first place.&nbsp; (Note: I watched several review videos on the bursts and none of them could get the spinners open; it&#39;s really not very hard).&nbsp; The spinning works nicely and although it scrapes on the ground for a couple of seconds, it begins moving smoothly and the transition from open to closed as it slows down is very smooth and satisfying.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Price:&nbsp;</strong>The price of the burst is pretty typical of Ninjago&#39;s smaller spinner-type sets.&nbsp; The price-to-part ratio isn&#39;t great, but they are decently large.&nbsp; The Kai minifigure is amazing, so $10 seems pretty nice.&nbsp; For what I have... I would really like some sort of sale but less than $10 for a LEGO set&nbsp;is completely unrealistic.</p>

<p><strong>Packaging:</strong> The box is amazing.&nbsp; It was very cool-looking for a Ninjago set, and the way it folds up reminds me of a McDonald&#39;s Happy Meal.&nbsp; It was a lot smaller than I thought, but the pictures (especially the Kai art) are also amazing.</p>

<p><strong>Kai:</strong> Kai is one of the most amazing Ninjago exclusive&nbsp;minifigures I&#39;ve ever seen.&nbsp; His mask is similar&nbsp;and looks the similar&nbsp;past renditions.&nbsp; His face looks amazing, and I have loved the way Kai&#39;s animation looks in even the new Ninjago show.&nbsp; His eyes glow, the fire that streaks&nbsp;down his fierce face.&nbsp; The fire all over him is nice and contrasts nicely with the red.&nbsp; Kai&#39;s robes look almost sensei-like to me, which I enjoy.&nbsp; The dragon on his back is absolutely stunning.&nbsp; I&#39;m in awe with this figure.</p>

<p><strong>Recap:&nbsp;</strong>This spinner is similar, and the best parts of the set are the minifigure, box, and parts are the best parts of the set.&nbsp; Overall, I&#39;m happy with this.</p>
