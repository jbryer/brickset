"Niki124","2021-02-02T21:31:46.353Z","A work-in-progress from Lego","<p>This, along with the corresponding police car, were the first Lego sets with minifigures my sister and I had (technically they were my sister&#39;s, but it was just a technicality).</p>

<p>Like many Lego fans I could never understand why they had designed a vehicle which the minifigure could not get into. The vehicle and figure appeared to be built to different scales, but at least with the ambulance the minifigure could sit on the roof to &#39;drive&#39;.</p>

<p>Maybe the small size was to have a product to target those of us who saved our pocket money for a set. Looking back, it feels like an interim design on the way to something a little bigger and a lot better.</p>

<p>If this is a promotional set then that&rsquo;s totally fine.&nbsp;But if it&rsquo;s not, then I don&rsquo;t understand why an ambulance with a minifigure was released so the minifigure doesn&rsquo;t fit. It doesn&rsquo;t take long to assemble a vehicle from these few parts.</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>What is special is the transparent blue cylinder&nbsp;piece top is solid stud, not open stud.&nbsp;So rarer and more expensive.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifig</strong></h3>

<p>Same as in&nbsp;the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/623-1/Red-Cross-Car"" target=""_blank"">623</a> set.&nbsp;The torso is not printed, but has a sticker red cross on it.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall opinion&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>For some reason, hospital-themed sets have always been neglected by Lego.&nbsp;<strong>Maybe kids don&rsquo;t like this theme so much?</strong> Because there are millions of police and firefighter-themed sets.&nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know how much was sold from this set, but the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/623-1/Red-Cross-Car"" target=""_blank"">623</a> set was better worth buying.</p>

<h3><strong>Pros</strong></h3>

<p>We get a cute doctor for the set.</p>

<h3><strong>Cons</strong></h3>

<p>Unfortunately, we had to wait until 1981 to get the<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6680-1/Ambulance"" target=""_blank""> first minifigure-sized ambulance</a>.</p>

<h3><strong>My Mod</strong></h3>

<p>Well, I didn&rsquo;t wait until 1981, I made an existing car into a minifigure-sized ambulance.&nbsp;Among the old legos, I found what I had built as a child and was not dismantled.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, since there were no panel pieces at the time, the patient&nbsp;does not fit inside it, only turned to the side.</p>

<p>You can actually still put a red car door in it, but back then I only had bricks and a plate.&nbsp;Let&rsquo;s say I didn&rsquo;t build this in the 70s but in the 90s, when I was a kid. But I had a lot of inherited old 1970s legos.&nbsp;This car also consists of only a few bricks and plates. So lego designers can&rsquo;t apologize just for the price. I make some render photos is well:&nbsp;</p>
