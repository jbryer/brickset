The exterior is gorgeous and blows the 2010 version out of the water! The upper floors might look unstable, but trust me, the Lego designers have done a great job here! The set is very stable and the play features work perfectly.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a Harry Potter fanboy myself, and there&#39;s a ton of references and details for all HP fans to spot! In fact, there&#39;s some book related details which didn&#39;t appear in the movies! The minifigures are awesome as well! I was especially excited to get my first Bellatrix, who doesn&#39;t appear in a lot of sets, but the rest of them are just as good!</p>

<p>While I do think that 120 Eur&nbsp;is a bit overpriced for this set, I can&#39;t really complain about it, as the pricing is far from terrible. It is a set with over 1000 pieces after all.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In the end, this is definitely one of the best sets within the theme. I think it&#39;s safe to say that this set is in my top 3 along with Hogwarts Castle from 2010 and 4 Privet Drive of this year. Amazing set,&nbsp;would totally recommend this one.</p>

"lego_sloth","2020-09-30T23:50:14.547Z","This. Is. BEAUTIFUL!","<p>This set is stunning. I will start with the minifigures. First off, I am so pleased to finally have a Tonks minifigure. I do wish that her hair was pink though. The rest of the minifigures are amazing too. The Weasleys are perfectly rumpled, and Harry is quite accurate this year, as I feel as though he has not been very accurate in the previous waves. Now, on to the building. It is stunning! It is packed with details, such as Molly&#39;s clock, the green fire in the fireplace, the knitting supplies, and the picture of the Weasleys in Egypt! I also love Ron and Ginny&#39;s Quidditch themed blankets! My only complaint is that Ron&#39;s bedroom is a bit too cramped for me to get in there and play. That is the only flaw though! I also love the new Hedwig mold, and the pink pig is SO CUTE! I do wish that the owl was grey, because I do believe that Errol was grey. It could be Pidwigeon though. Anyway, if you can find it, snatch this set up now, it was difficult for me to find.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Esperienza di costruzione molto divertente, sia per la grande quantit&agrave; di oggetti mobili sia per la quantit&agrave; di pezzi e dettagli.</p>

<p>L&#39;ho trovata tuttavia un po&#39; piena, con poco spazio di gioco all&#39;interno, ma credo che sia in linea con la Tana, che non &egrave; una casa molto grande e spaziosa.</p>

<p>Consigliato</p>
