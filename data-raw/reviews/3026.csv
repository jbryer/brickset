"Novelty","2007-04-07T10:27:40.287Z","This is a classic castle set?","This must be the oddest classic castle set as it is one of the most colourful castle sets ever.  Despite the dazzling array of colours though, it includes some rather interesting items.  This is the first set with joust guide rail, and the first one with a beer keg.  The pavillion is of an odd design but the weapon's rack is masterfully done.  This could have been a good set if the use of colours were muted.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<p>Truth is it all depends on one's age me thinks.&nbsp; I was in Jr. High (I believe) when I received this and saw it as more a display piece.&nbsp; However, my 6 year old son loves to play with this set and I think is attracted to the bright colours and horses.</p>
<p>Essentially this seems like a glorified figure builder piece containing 2 opposing jousting knights, 2 opposing fans for said knights, a queen/princess and a page. (surprised there wasn't one&nbsp;per knight or perhaps a male figure of royalty)</p>
<p>Everyone except the knights is enjoying the keg (you can see it in their little Lego perma-grins) The princess/queen was my first female mini-figure, but the only distinguishing features to reveal this are the printed necklace and headdress since this was&nbsp;before individualized face decals and dress bottoms became the norm - yes this girl is waaaaay ahead of her time in the&nbsp;slacks department.</p>
<p>Playset comes with 2 horses (also my first Lego animals I believe), jousting guide-rail, KEG! (with plenty of glasses to go around), authentic weapon rack, and spectator stand with convertible canopys for easy access.&nbsp; The canopy pieces were the unique parts for this set, the rest being pretty much standard red, blue and yellow bricks.&nbsp; Oh yes, to offset the scenery, there is a nice, sturdy, molded tree.&nbsp; I miss these. (see tree-rant on Apple Tree House review)</p>
<p>Overall a great set as the several land-based pieces are moveable for various options of display and you get a ton of figures PLUS it's a light-hearted, jovial&nbsp;theme of contested sport&nbsp;for the Castle system.</p>
<p>Go get you one before they run out of mead!</p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5
"Sebastian","2012-04-13T13:51:20.187Z","Collector's gem","<p>I was able to build a copy of this set from pieces and got hold of the original instructions recently and I have to say getting all the parts off bricklink was really worthwhile. The set just has some kind of magic to it and teems with nice accessories. Maybe it is a little small for today's standards, but I think there isn't a lack of anything.</p>
<p>The grandstand is the&nbsp;main model&nbsp;here and it's done in a quirky way with unusual parts. The keg of ale&nbsp;and the weapon's rack further add to the festive scene. The minifigs are all great&nbsp;and there are eight figs in the set which is quite uncommon for a set of&nbsp;such a&nbsp;small size. I recommend the set to&nbsp;collectors who have always liked it but never got around to actually buy a copy. I for one did not regret it, even though it was hard to find&nbsp;those horse bardings with intact clips at a reasonable price.&nbsp;I like Knight's Challenge&nbsp;so much that I would even say&nbsp;it has become the centerpiece of my collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
