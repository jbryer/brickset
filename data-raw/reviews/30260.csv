"Automaton120","2020-08-08T15:05:48.87Z","Excellent set!","<p>I&#39;ve been a LEGO Star Wars fan for well over a decade at this point, and this is the first time I&#39;ve owned an AT-AT (despite several having been released since I started out). Just by looking at the images of previous models, this is by far the most faithful and accurate where shaping and detail is concerned.</p>

<p>The build wasn&#39;t particularly difficult but tying the string pieces for winches is never fun. I also built the legs simultaneously instead of individually, which minimised the repetition. The back portion is the first part of the walker to be built, and it gives you an impression pretty soon of how big the vehicle is going to be. There are five seats for minifigures in the back section, with room to stand or sit even more if you don&#39;t dock the speeder.</p>

<p>The cockpit can fit three minifigures, which as far as I&#39;m aware is the first time such a thing has been done on a LEGO AT-AT. It&#39;s a tight squeeze, but an inclusion that I really appreciate. There are some brown and orange pieces on the very back of the &quot;head&quot; that look a bit odd, but from forward-facing angles they&#39;re not visible and can be replaced with black or grey if necessary.</p>

<p>Positioning the legs can be a bit awkward but so far I&#39;ve not had the set topple etc.</p>

<p>The minifigure selection might not be the most unique but as someone with an interest in building up an Imperial army, two drivers is especially generous. The snowtroopers are also solid with General Veers and Luke Skywalker probably the least interesting figures of the bunch (Luke is pretty much the same as the one in last year&#39;s snowspeeder). Still, they&#39;re relevant to the set and this is one that people will be buying for the vehicle anyway.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sold on the speeder bike being entirely brick-built, but that might just be nostalgia speaking because I grew up with the ones that use the trike frame. Still, it looks the part and is a welcome addition to my collection of such vehicles. The E-web cannon is also pretty good and might be of additional interest since it recently appeared in The Mandalorian.</p>

<p>Price-wise I don&#39;t think it&#39;s too bad either; ultimately you&#39;re getting a large, iconic vehicle that does more than enough justice to the source material and generally looks fantastic. Good play value, and is also accurate enough to be a great display piece too. Definitely a set with wide appeal and I&#39;m glad to have this in my collection.</p>

"Armstrs","2020-08-17T20:40:04.103Z","Amazing Build","<p>Like some of you,&nbsp;I am fortunate to live close to a big chain store that laughs in the face of street dates. So when I saw this on the shelf 2 weeks early, I yelled &ldquo;woohoo!&rdquo; and ran to check out.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve never had an AT-AT before. The first one I ever wanted was in 1981 and it was made by Kenner. I never got it, and for some reason I never got any of the previous LEGO versions either.</p>

<p>So I was super excited to put this together. The box is rather large and has great shots of all the features and minifigs. I love that it has the 40th anniversary branding, and the background shot of AT-ATs on Hoth is fantastic.</p>

<p>The minifigure&nbsp;selection included is pretty much perfect. Luke is the same from recent&nbsp;sets but he now has the frosted trans blue lightsaber blade and a couple of thermal detonators. There is still a little orange bleed through the white parts of his flight suit but it is fine. The stormtroopers are great too and I really like the shape of the helmets and&nbsp;their tan gloves. I do wish they would have included the fabric kamas though. We also get two AT-AT drivers and general Veers. They are all extremely detailed and have fantastic printing. And all three can fit in the cockpit! If LEGO&nbsp;would have included a micro-fig&nbsp;holographic Vader though, it would have&nbsp;just been the icing on the cake. &ldquo;The shield&nbsp;will be down in moments, you may start your landing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I took my time with the build and savoured every minute. It was nothing&nbsp;complicated but there were&nbsp;a couple tricky tight areas. I do not know if there&rsquo;s were any new parts but there were definitely a few I had never seen before. I really enjoyed the smaller builds too. The speeder bike has a lot of detail and the E-web gun is a genius use of tiny parts. And both of these have a dedicated storage spot inside the walker.</p>

<p>Once completed, I felt it was a little smaller than I had anticipated.&nbsp;Sure I&rsquo;ve seen videos and saw the measurements but I thought it would be taller, maybe?&nbsp;It does not <i>really</i> fit size-wise with the most recent snow speeder or AT-ST. But, it still looked pretty sweet &ldquo;crushing&rdquo; a snow&nbsp;speeder under one of the legs. And I&rsquo;m not complaining. I would not change the size of this. It is perfect for play AND display.</p>

<p>But they really nailed the proportions and shaping of this. It&rsquo;s one of those sets you can&rsquo;t help but stare at it and admire the design. It is so well balanced that you can pose&nbsp;the legs to make it look like it is walking and the articulation in the &lsquo;neck&rsquo; means you can really aim at those fighters coming in. And it is surprisingly sturdy. The legs may wobble a bit but it does not fall. And you could probably throw it off your roof and the head would still be attached to the body.</p>

<p>Having watched comparison videos, I really feel like this could be&nbsp;the best AT-AT design yet. But if you have a previous one, you may be fine to skip this especially if you are lucky enough to have the motorized one. But I would happily pay full MSRP for this all day, every day. I think it is priced appropriately. It looks amazing, the vehicle is iconic, and it has enough presence to make it a centerpiece of many collections.</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2021-02-07T01:34:52.553Z","A beautiful build that's amazingly accurate and worth every penny ","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>The lego Star Wars AT-AT (all terrain armoured&nbsp;transport) from summer 2020 was my major birthday gift for 2021and I must say it&nbsp;is an amazing set released six years after its 2014 variant and this set outshines that in all check boxes especially in the accuracy department although like the razor crest 75292 it could use some work in the figure department .</p>

<p>The minifigures-</p>

<p>The figures starting with Luke Skywalker , he has his rebel pilot helmet with great printing , a face with the visor and a smiling expression printed and on the back a face with the visor up and a larger grin , his torso and legs are a very good printed rebel flight suit&nbsp;, he wields a regular blue bladed lightsaber and a printed thermal detonator , next we have General Veers he has a fantastic helmet mould with printing on the front , a face with a headset and frowning face and an evilish grin on the back , the torso is appropriate with armour and a generals rank plaque , his legs are unprinted in dark grey , he wields&nbsp;some dark grey electrobinoculars , next we have the AT-AT pilots (although in universe only one is a pilot and the other is a gunner)&nbsp;they&nbsp;are identical other than their face prints the have incredible helmet printing that really cannot be improved in any major way&nbsp;other than the exposed back of the head at the back , the faces are a Lex Luthor face and a Tom Riddle head , the torso and legs are&nbsp;very detailed with a continuous print , they both wield a small blaster pistol in black and finally we have the snowtroopers , like the AT-AT pilots thy are identical excusing&nbsp;the faces the have simplistic helmet prints , one has a exhausted&nbsp;face print whilst the other has just a stern expression , their&nbsp;torsos&nbsp;are nice and the same goes for the legs , they both wield a standard black blaster rifle .</p>

<p>The builds-</p>

<p>The main build being&nbsp;the all terrain armoured&nbsp;transport starting with the feet , they are built on 4x4 black plates with a modified dark pink 2x4 brick in the centre , there are three main toe assembly&#39;s on each foot , built on two 2x3 light grey angled plates with a 2x2 light grey slope on top , there is also an inner toe that is smaller with a 1x2 light grey cheese slope , there are angled bricks on each foot with a 6x6 light grey dish on top , then there is a 4x4 light grey round brick with a light grey arch attached above with snot built around a technic lift arm for the leg&#39;s armour plating consisting of angled plates , 1x2 slopes , 1x4 tiles and light grey CMF stands , where the foot connects to the leg at the bottom inside there is a beam build made of bars clip adaptors and half technic pins , at the middle point of the leg there is a hinge connection with a 4x4 light grey dish for the joint covering , further up we get the second portion of the leg built on another technic lift arm with a snot build around it as well consisting of 1x6 light grey tiles , 1x4 light grey tiles and more light grey CMF stands , there is another joint covered by a 4x4 light grey dish and these are securely attached to body with technic axles and pins and just to note these legs are very well articulated and are great fun to pose it in a walking stance . Now moving from the legs we start the main hull of the walker starting with the area where the legs attach it is tiled off behind with curved plates attached with a snot technique at each side , the middle of the bottom sides has an assembly attached with clips it consists of angled plates introduced in the 2020 TIE dagger but the ingenious part of this build the the central snot build for the vents incorporated side ways to get a very nice grilled effect , behind where the rear legs attach there are more tiles and curved plates and in the centre there are two 3x3 light grey round tiles for more mechanical detailing which are just great pieces on their own and there are two on each side , at the very back there is a panel assembly built on some plates and angled plates with the outside having a clip and bar assembly having some dark grey flags as well and a sloped brick with some curved underneath and jumpers inside and a 1x3 light grey tile for detail in the centre and a large light grey technic wheel at the bottom for detail , now e have the two side panels for te back they are built on 6x8 plates with angled wing plates around the sides and two 2x3 light grey tiles for decoration along with a clip and clip receiver attached for more detail these are attached with mini ball joints , the central panels consist of a 6x12 light grey plate and a 6x12 jumper the plate has six 1x2 divider plates leading up the sides with a 4x6 light grey jumper for further panelling this are connected to technic bricks and you pull and lift to open them up the front panels are smaller than the&nbsp;rear and are built on angled plates with jumpers and two 2x3 light grey tiles on top for more detail and the front roof panel is built on a 4x6 modified dark grey plate with modified 1x2s and CMF stands in light grey for the roofing , the centre roofing of the body is very simple just consisting of two 4x12 light grey plates and the back roof panel is also built on a modified 4x6 dark grey plate also with CMF stand ,modified 1x2s and a snot plate in dark grey as a sort of lock attached to a 2x4 light grey tile . Now we move onto the interior with one side consisting of three sand blue seats with a black railing in he middle , the other side has two more seats in sand blue with a side assembly with a bar sticking uo for you to attach the included E-WEB heavy repeating blaster which Moff Gideon has a interest in , however here lies one of my major flaws of the set te interior has space for five snowtroopers yet the set only comes with two which is quite frustrating , when you open the back panel and back roof panel to an area in which you can insert a speeder bike which is also included , and when open the front roof panel you reveal a winch mechanism that can lower down a string which runs through te body and comes out underneath being tied to a galaxy squad gun piece and if you could not tell this is all for Luke to pull himself up to destroy the craft and underneath lego also included a feature of a clip attachment to a hinge&nbsp;to show the hatch in which Luke enters . Lastly we have the head starting with the neck which is very strongly attached with technic to the body and head , the neck has three dark grey technic steering wheels for a good but open design , the nose panel for the head is a brick build with snots on the sides and a 1x2 light grey ingot at the bottom , the windshield is very sleek as a single black line with cheese slopes around it , the sides are built out of angled plates and loped bricks at the bottom and the panels above are angled with 4x4 light grey dishes on it with clips and computer screen pieces and long bars for the main side canons and the back is elevated with more angled plates and 1x2 light grey grilles , the roof is built out of a 1x8 and 4x8 light grey plate with an elevated slope build in the middle with a 2x3 light grey tile , the interior has space for the pilot and gunner and general veers with two printed 1x2 dark grey cheese slope consoles at the front and two more on each side at the back there are also two reciprocating cannons at the bottom attached bt hollow studs and using flick fire missiles .&nbsp;Additionally, in the set there are two side builds that can be placed inside the AT-AT starting with the E-WEB heavy repeating blaster canon it is on a tripod base with three black galaxy squad guns and a 1x1 cone with the main blaster on top consisting of roller skates , jumpers , candles , unprinted BB-9E heads and lightsaber hilts , the speeder is built on a 2x6 black plate with a snot brick at the front with two bars with white angled fins at the very front and white sloping on the body , two&nbsp;handle bars and a build at the back with white slopes and a cannon underneath it with two foot breaks as well .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a fantastic set , with its presence really felt in a room and it also makes for&nbsp;a great toy with playability through the roof my only proper complaint other than some dodgy technic pins showing is the lack of more snowtroopers as this is a transport and the fact that not even half of the seats are filled and&nbsp;there are not really any other easy ways to get snowtroopers nowadays , but overall I&nbsp;100% recommend this set to every lego star war fan as it is already a highlight of my collection .</p>

"Struhadlo","2020-08-28T18:17:20.477Z","Almost a perfect set.. almost","<p>Ever since I was a wee lad I desired this vehicle badly and my wish was never granted as my parents never possessed sufficient funds to buy me any version of this fan-favourite Walker. Now as an adult I got extremely excited when the AT-AT was announced for I knew I would be able to make the purchase. And I knew this set is going to be a good one. I could see my problems with it immediately and what I would eventually like as well, so the set itself did not bring too many surprises. Anyway let&#39;s dive into the review and see if it is worth the money.</p>

<p><strong>PRICE</strong></p>

<p>I must say I did expect this set to include a Rebel Snow Speeder when the price was clear earlier this February, but I was pretty shocked to see the AT-AT alone. Later I got used to the price and since the set contains 1267 pieces for $160 I do not find it that bad. It is around the same value as the forthcoming and already beloved <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75292-1/The-Razor-Crest"" target=""_blank"">75929 </a>Razor Crest. The vehicle is obviously pretty substantial and there is a lot of improvement over the last iteration and as such I take this set as somewhat alright priced. It is an expensive set, but there are far worse in this wave alone.</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>

<p>The minifig selection I find to be the most lacking part of the set. The minifigs are gorgeous to the last, but there is just not enough given the price. I think two more Snowtroopers would work far better and the set would give a much richer vibe. I know it is just two minifigs, but trust me, the smallest adjustments can do a lot! None of the minifigs have an arm printing.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Luke Skywalker. The only real improvement I see at this point is an arm printing which is not present here as the print on torso, the back and the legs is astonishingly detailed and well done. Not even the orange of the body bleeds through the white vest too noticeably in this case. Maybe at the back it does a little. Luke has two face prints as usual. The first one is a mild smile with a visor down and the second is excited with the visor up. The Rebel helmet is as detailed as it gets. Skywalker has his father&#39;s blue lightsaber which blade is not frosted in my version and two thermal detonators.</li>
	<li>General Maximilian Veers. One of more capable Imperial high ranking officials, considering he does never get chocked by Vader, comes with rather plane torso and back print, but sufficient as it captures his battle armour pretty accurately. There is no leg printing surprisingly which could be a further improvement in the future. There is an excited facial expression and one mildly concerned. Both do not capture general too well as they show him to be little too old, which is a minor discrepancy. Anyway, the microphone is present in both cases and the helmet is in sand blue colour with no other print beside the goggles. Veers does not come with any weaponry beside his binoculars. Pro-tips and tricks time! If you want to be able to put the binoculars right in front of his eyes, you need to turn the holding hand around and adjust the head a wee bit.</li>
	<li>AT-AT Driver. My boy did Lego step up their game this time. Not only both drivers do have a different face, but they also have different faces to the two Snowtroopers. So no more angry clone faces here! The print feels very well finished and detailed enough. There are some panels at the chest to further the detail game here. Funnily enough one of my pilots does have a print where the middle stripe is going down his knickers&nbsp;at the belly lines up with the print on the waist while the other does not. The helmet is a standard pilot mold with new printing which I find excellent. The only drawback to this mold is the revealed back of the head. Both drivers are armed with small blaster pistols.</li>
	<li>Snowtrooper. Nothing has changed since 2019 with these guys except for the head faces which are not new and were used in previous sets but not in case of Imperial Troopers. The print is pretty well lined up all throughout the torso, waist and the legs. The panels with all the buttons at the back and the front are amongst the finest details and the helmet mold I find perfect. Please, do not change the helmet mold here.I do not know why Lego stopped using the fabric around the legs and the bags for the Snowtroopers, but they did and I find the choice of getting rid of the bags pretty dumb. Their absence is my only real criticism towards the minifig selection in this set. The missing fabric does not pain me since the print is enough of a&nbsp;compensation.</li>
</ul>

<p>By the way, the use of Luke Skywalker is inaccurate here, since this is NOT the AT-AT he blows up in the picture. General Veers makes it out alive while Luke bombs a different one. This is just a fun fact, and I am not mad at Lego for including both of these characters here at all.</p>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>E-web heavy repeating blaster canon lacks the small connectable battery station here but I do not mind as the build is pretty sleek and I like it this way better. I am not even sure if this is supposed to be said weapon, but it looks nice and minifig can stand right behind it and hold it without any issue.</p>

<p>The Imperial Snow Speeder bike is in its newest rendition here and shows some surprisingly advanced building techniques for such a small build. The handlebars can not only move horizontally e.g. forward and backward, but since they are attached to a joint, the can move in their base forward, creating sort of a circular rotation if you were to look at the Speeder from the top. A single minifig can sit in the Speeder Bike while holding onto the handlebars. Speaking of which they present the only downside somewhat as removing a minifig holding them might rip them from the Bike.</p>

<p>The main build is a magnificent one, and I am more than confident that this is the best AT-AT produced by Lego to this day. It has the most play features, it has solved the previous issues, is the most accurate model and is built&nbsp;with the best building techniques yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are basically no part falling from the build upon a slight touch and the Walker is pretty sturdy. You can move it around while holding the body, head or even a leg and the build should stay together. If you play with the model recklessly, some panels might get unattached, but that is usually an easy fix. Most of the panels are held by smooth joints to provide a seamless movement. The only panel connected by hinges is the backdoor for the Speeder. The Speeder can get stored in the walker easily since there is a compartment. It does not prevent any minifigs&nbsp;being placed inside. There are railways so that the Speeder is securely held in there. The main area of the body can be accessed from both sides by lifting the large middle side panels. Those are attached by technic rods and because of that they can be moved in a surprisingly large angle and a lot of positions. Inside, there are five seats in a sand blue colour, but there is space for much more troops. On the right side, there is a compartment next to the seats for the E-web Cannon. Right above the neck is the last openable panel which hides a gear for the cable&nbsp;under the belly of the AT-AT. The cable is attached to a blaster pistol which can Luke hold onto while getting lifted towards a little openable hatch on the belly&nbsp;of the Walker where he can throw a thermal detonator.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The neck is surrounded by three large Technic steering wheels. There is a rubber part in the connection of the neck to the body so whenever you move the neck, it will always return to the middle position. As for the head, it can move freely in a roughly 60-degree angle. The head then stays in the position unlike the neck. The head is armed with two side cannons with a full rotation and two smaller cannons under the chin. Those smaller cannons can be plucked off if you push them too hard, so be careful. Right next to those the head holds two spring-loaded shooters. In order to utilise the shooting mechanism, you need to manually press the missiles from the bottom of the head. There is no brick build shooting mechanism incorporated in this model. What is a yet another huge improvement over any previous model is the space in the cockpit which get revealed after opening the hatch that can be moved in various positions since it is connected with Technic rods. The cockpit can house up to three minifigs but not with an absolute easy. Understandably it is quite a tight fit, so you better place the minifig at the back first, and then proceed to seat the drivers without any weapons in hands. The inside is detailed with printed control panel pieces.&nbsp;The face of the head is attached by a hinge and can be move forward slightly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The legs are articulable quite a lot. You can move them forward in their upper joint and backwards as well. The knee joints allow for a similar movement and the feet can be moved forward and backward but not to the sides. Thanks to this large possibility of movement, the Walker can stand in various positions, but you have to keep the balance in mind as standing on three legs is not a possibility. Also, if you put the front legs too forward, they might slight pretty quickly making the beast crash with its face down. The sturdy build can usually take it though. The armour plates on the legs are connected by little Technic pins which does not sound as the sturdiest connection, but it works just fine.</p>

<p>Overall the building experience was a ton of fun, but it took a little while to assemble as there were some redundant and&nbsp;pretty tedious parts, namely&nbsp;legs. Besides that the instruction were very clear and the model easy to build except for the rope part which was painfully dreadful. There are no stickers used during the build which is a great thing for someone with shaky hands like me. There are no special pieces beside the minifig unique parts I think, but there are some parts which I&nbsp;have never seen in this colour variant.</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>This is probably the strongest suit of the whole set. Six minifigs from both confronting sides of the conflict are a good start for a battle play. The AT-AT can walk around, has a ton of openable hatches and panels. Furthermore, it provides additional small build to make the experience even better. The spring-loaded shooters are expected nowadays with most of the current models, but they still provide nice play value. The cable gun think at the bottom of the Walker can lift-up a minifig easily. It is clear to say that the playability here is absolutely perfect and any kid can spend a lot of time with this set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>Now the important question. Is this a perfect and special set deserving a five-star rating? Obviously the building techniques have evolved, and they are spectacular, but the play features and the accuracy of the build is not guaranteed by the modern times and experience and there are still some inaccurate and useless sets. The minifig selection has a lot of going for it, but the lack of a leg print on one minifig, no bags carried by the Snowtroopers and lack of them are valid drawbacks. The playability is fantastic and the set can be utilised as a gorgeous display piece too. But the demerits of the minifigs are not as significant and the designer team really tried to do their best with the model and it shows, so for me, it is a five out of five.</p>

<p>Should you buy this set? Definitely! If you do not own any previous AT-AT and want one, this is your time. And even if you collections contains any of the Walkers of the past, this is still a major improvement especially for a collector. This model will look wee bit strange next to the others, but as a standalone AT-AT I think it is the best by far. The price is somewhat steep, but it is no Sith Tie Fighter thankfully.</p>

<p>Overall a great set and my favourite of the whole wave, good job Lego.</p>

<p>I had many fun hours of putting this together, not that it is hard to build (although that said, there are some tricky bits) and am very happy with the model.</p>

<p>The instructions are clear and easy to follow. I am also happy that there were no stickers for me to fight with. I agree with many people that the string for Luke to dangle from is not the easiest to tie into a knot and would love it if the one side that is visible when on display was rather built around a lego clip piece instead of an unsightly knot. I chose to rather not have luke hanging in there rather than have that string showing.</p>

<p>The posing of the legs was a bit of a nightmare, the pose I want inevitable would result in an unstable display piece that would fall over at the slightest knock. But I eventually found a happy medium.</p>

<p>Overall I am very happy and look forward to building a few more for my eventual Hoth display shelf.</p>

"Dude45","2021-12-05T10:34:18.317Z","Not a good playset & cannot be disassembled?!","<p>This set sure looks the part, and works well mainly as a display piece. That&#39;s where the positives end.</p>

<h3>Cannot stand up</h3>

<p>As a playset (which this is advertised to be) it falls way short. The main problem is that the model is <strong>not strong enough</strong> to stand up on its own. If you try to play with it you will notice that the legs&#39; joints are not strong enough to stay put, resulting in the model falling over. And even if the joins do stay put, the model is not stable in its length direction, so it easily falls on its side. My kids tried playing with it, but gave up after it constantly fell.</p>

<h3>Cannot be disassembled?</h3>

<p>Worst thing about this set&nbsp;is that it doesn&#39;t seem to be possible to disassemble it. The part&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6265643/frame-7x11"">Frame-7x11</a> is jammed with Technic axles from all sides that cannot be removed as they are inserted one way only. A <a href=""https://brickset.com/article/67650/lego-has-designed-a-set-that-can-t-be-taken-apart"">similar issue</a> exists on the UCS version of AT-AT <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75313-1"">75313</a>. I was able to break my set apart by using brute force. Does anybody know of a legal way?&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Quality assurance?</h3>

<p>As an avid LEGO collector this set made me <strong>very disappointed</strong>. It clearly cannot be advertised as a playset. It&#39;s worrying that more reports of serious design flaws in other sets begin to surface. LEGO designers and the quality assurance department clearly need to up their game.</p>

"wheetree","2022-05-17T03:23:47.95Z","Can't support it's own weight.","<p>Overall, this is a great set.&nbsp; It&#39;s a fun build with lots of interesting details, some fun minifigs, and lots of possibility for both playability and display ability.</p>

<p>BUT as much as I like it, it has some flaws that bring it down.</p>

<p>First, a nit-picky one as an old Star Wars fan (as in I went and saw &quot;Star Wars&quot; opening weekend old):&nbsp; speeder bikes don&#39;t belong on Hoth.&nbsp; The alliance was still working to adapt their craft to the cold.&nbsp; Any Imperial trying to ride a bike would be an instant popsicle.</p>

<p>Next, I wish they would make an AT-AT where the side doors fold DOWN not up, to act as ramps for the troops to exit. With this, the AT-AT needs to be able to kneel.&nbsp; Please LEGO, make an AT-AT with these capabilities.</p>

<p>The BIGGEST problem with this set, and the one that absolutely kills it, is that it simply can&#39;t support it&#39;s own weight unless you have the legs perfectly straight. I have tried to display mine with the legs bent only one notch each (as in the pic on another review). The legs slid out from under it on the shelf.&nbsp; So, I used brick tape to hold the feet in place.&nbsp; This lasted for a while but a breeze from my wife opening the back door of my man-cave was enough to topple it. Even with the legs straight, the head is heavy enough that the whole thing wants to tip/slide forward. I&#39;m going to try again with the legs straight, but it just doesn&#39;t look right that way.&nbsp; Any suggestions for non-permanently locking the legs so it can support its own weight?&nbsp; If I could display it and move it around in my Hoth collection display, I&#39;d probably give it all 5s.&nbsp; This one is not easy to disassemble and re-assemble every time it takes a dive off the shelf.</p>

Extremely accurate in the actual design, huge detail on the outside and quite good on the inside (fits minifigures, speeder and has additional functions). The cockpit is a little cramped, but successful. Although I prefer the First Order 75189 as a construction (much tighter), it is very successful (and with emotional value: 40 years since&#39; Empire Strikes Back &#39;). Enough and interesting minifigures (I would like 1-2 more snowtroopers). The value (EUR160) correctly represents the value given the size and number of pieces. Good gift for connoisseurs.</p>

<p>Minifigs are all perfect choices for the set and all look accurate and good.</p>

<p>The interior is such an improvement from previous versions, lots of space, chairs, a place for the speeder and, best of all, three figs can fit in the cockpit.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Only flaw is the posability. There aren&#39;t many positions for the legs to go in, and the hinges are not too strong.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all a top tier lego set</p>
