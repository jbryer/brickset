Almost...","<p>Another set from one of my two favourite themes, this one comes at around 500 pieces and a retail price of nearly 60&euro; (far too much, imo). I got it for some 47&euro; at Amazon, which is an OK price. Basically, this is the underwater equivalent to the 2019 <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60227-1/Lunar-Space-Station"">60227 Lunar Space Station</a>, regarding looks, design, building method, used parts and even strangeness in design. Also once again, this set had me reeling between three and four stars, with tendency to four. 3.7 oe 3.8 would have been my exact rating. In detail:</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>There are a lot of large parts, which makes the build quite easy and quickly manageable. The pods consist of large bottom and top parts, just like with the mentioned Lunar Station, the submarine-pod consists of one of those cargo-area-like parts, that were also used in the City Spaceport-series (e.g. the rocket in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60228-1/Deep-Space-Rocket-and-Launch-Control"">60228 Deep Space Rocket Launch Control</a>). There are several bluish underwater plants, an old bike without wheels and even an old licence plate to make things look more realistic. New to me were the blue quarter circle parts that surround the turbine atop the station.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>This set comes with five minifigures and three&nbsp;sea animals. We have a male and a female diver in light diving gear (I like the design of the new helmets!) with flippers, a male diver in heavy diving gear with some sort of litter-picker and a male and female scientist/technician/pilot. The three&nbsp;animals included are a yellow crab, a ray made of one piece and a very cool looking hammerhead shark. The divers have some additional gear like a treasure chest with diamonds, a small transport box and some compressed air bottles.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As stated before, the large parts make the whole build quite easy and not very challenging. The four instruction booklets are overly detailed, as usual and leave no room for doubts or mistakes. After assembling the minifigures, the small rover and the platform with the supplies, the base is built from the large bottom plates up. After the central hub is placed on the supporting framework, the two pods to the left and right are built in the same fashion and attached via TECHNIC pins. The last part of the instructions covers the third &quot;pod&quot; which also serves as a small cargo submarine. What accommodated me&nbsp;was the small number of transparent stickers, that had to be applied.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The Ocean Exploration Base turns out to be quite a large set when finished. The colour pattern of yellow, red and blue looks classy and modern at the same time. The seaweed and the litter, that cover the sea floor give the set a realistic touch.<br />
The central hub has a large turbine at the top, a flexible crane with a hook to lift the supply platform and a large open back&nbsp;with a handlewheel and an air tank inside.<br />
The left compartment of the Base houses the crew quarters, as its sticker states. Inside is a bed in nautical colours (blue and white) and a table of sorts with a nice lamp and a coffee machine. Spartan, yet effective. The right compartment&nbsp;holds the control room. Inside are a rotating chair, some small controls, a syringe (?) and an aquarium (??). Both compartments have portholes to each side and a large transparent, dome-shaped window at one end (these are no hatches, only windows, I guess). Also, they each have a spot for a hook to latch on, probably to pull the parts back up to the surface (combination with the 60266 Exploration Ship, perhaps?) and small spotlights to each side of the large dome-window.<br />
The third &quot;compartment&quot; is a detachable submarine, that has a small cargo area behind the cockpit. This area fits the treasure chest, but nothing else. The sub has two red air tanks, two large propellers, six spotlights surrounding the cockpit and two arms with hooks at the end.<br />
The small ROV that goes with the Base has one small propeller in the back and two claw arms, which can move up and down.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>The looks of the finished underwater base are quite impressive, more than I would have thought and surely more than the looks of the aforementioned Lunar Base. There are not that many functions as one would have probably expected, but that does not subtract from the outcome. Again, the realistic design speaks for itself, this time even managing to look quite cool. As stated before, I am very fond of the new diver helmets in red with integrated lights and visor. Actually, the number and design of the minifigures is one very strong positive point of this set, even the entire series. The compartments of the base have a simple, yet functional interior, all parts, that work with pressurized air are marked in red, the environmental design is also good and the sea animals and the rover are good additions to the overall picture of the set (yes, this was a poorly graded list, but it&#39;s late and I&#39;m tired). The big strength of this set is, in my eyes, the way it fits into this whole small series of only four sets. Standing alone, they are OK-to-good sets, but together, they guarantee hours of adventure!<br />
Now there&#39;s one huge negative point to this set, which cost it heavily in my opinion. As with the 60264 Exploration Sub, the Base has a large, open backside, as mentioned before. Now, this would not really be a problem, I could write it off as the &quot;dollhouse-effect&quot;. What really stumps me is the fact that the two compartments are open to this large central area. Again: this fact alone would make sense, the explorers have to get from one side of the base to the other, don&#39;t they? But these two facts combined (the large, open backside and the openings to the compartments) is so absolutely stupid and ruins the whole set to me to a certain degree. What I also could not figure out is the order of the numbers (stickers) on the set. Why is the ROV 2, while the compartments are 1 and 2? Strange, huh?<br />
OK, so all in all, this is still a good, impressive looking and detailed set. Focus is clearly on the playability, displaying is also possible, but only front view with the additional stuff as decoration.</p>

"tfranklin84","2023-03-04T20:05:16.357Z","Nice underwater set that was overpriced in the USA","<p>I&#39;m a big fan of underwater LEGO sets. I find that the vast majority they have ever done are just more pleasing and interesting to me than most other themes, especially for a 6+ city set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I&#39;ll keep it simple: as a fan of underwater LEGO sets, the only true negative I have with this set is its price in North America. Of course this is irrelevant now that it&#39;s out of print, but $80 just does not feel right when I look at the finished set. However, the piece count is not a fair judgement as this set has a LOT of large pieces, and relatively few single stud pieces. Maybe I&#39;m&nbsp;living in the past, but when I look at the finished model, I wish it were $60 or $65.<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Then again, one of my all time favorite sets is 6441 Deep Reef Refuge, which was $60 in 1997, which apparently is equal to about $111 today! And that set only had 433&nbsp;pieces. Still, when you look at what that set included, a large baseplate, 5 sea creatures, a full submarine, a medium sized boat, and a very cool lab, it is difficult to directly compare value.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value aside, there&#39;s a lot to like about this set. Unlike the Deep Reef Refuge from 1997 which was a whole underwater (and above water) scene, this one is mostly&nbsp;just an underwater base with 3 sections. For play, it&#39;s neat that the front module detaches as a sub, but I don&#39;t love it as a sub and will just leave it as part of the base. But my favourite part about sets like this is almost always the main structure/base itself, so I can&#39;t help but look fondly on this more modern set for focusing on the base, and including just enough sea life and terrain to sell the scene without using parts on less interesting builds. The two included sea creatures are really great (and a crab makes 3!), and there&#39;s just enough sea plant life to drive home that this is an underwater base.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the build is pretty simple as should be expected for a 6+ city set, and the price feels at least $10-$15 high in North America, but I will never complain about another underwater base. Ultimately,&nbsp;I think the scene is attractive on display and is a good addition to an underwater scene. This base could even be the centrepiece if you add some&nbsp;terrain/sea life side builds and maybe a separate submarine.&nbsp;Despite the value concerns, it&#39;s a strong 4 out of 5 for me, and I truly hope LEGO continues exploring the underwater depths.&nbsp;</p>
