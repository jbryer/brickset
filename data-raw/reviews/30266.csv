<p>The build itself is OK.&nbsp;There are two sheets of stickers (great quality, especially the windows) but they aren&#39;t difficult to apply and I didn&#39;t find them bothersome. The build is fairly fast (3 hours) with a fair mix of large and small parts. The brick quality of my set was not&nbsp;great, a lot of scratches and scuffs, especially on the large parts such as the glass dome. Annoying but easily replaced through the Lego website.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sadly, the finished build looks &quot;meh&quot; to me. I get the impression the designers didn&#39;t get enough &nbsp;budget to properly finish this set. The rooms are pretty much empty, especially compared to the &nbsp;high school. This&nbsp;is great for playability, you actually have room to place your&nbsp;characters. On the other hand, it feels like potential is wasted and some areas are really just left unfinished (e.g. &nbsp;the tower room). Furthermore, the scale seems a bit off, for example,&nbsp;the castle walls are too low, covering the minifigs feet instead of&nbsp;protecting the upper body.&nbsp;Provided you have the right bricks lying around, you can easily resolve all this yourself but of course you shouldn&#39;t have to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The play features of the set are quite limited. There are no transformation options, which &nbsp;I honestly don&#39;t mind, but other than a trap-door, nothing is offered. Combined with the empty rooms, it just feels...empty and a bit dull.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs are nice, especially the evil wizard looks great. However, he also is another example of how unfinished this set is. He doesn&#39;t have something on his head (which is fine) but also the back of his&nbsp;armour is left empty, leaving to points exposed where you would typically expect to connect something like wings. Combined, this fig feels unfinished.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all, I&#39;m disappointed with this set and&nbsp;probably going to sell it&nbsp;and&nbsp;search for that other scary castle,&nbsp;9468 Vampyre Castle.</p>
