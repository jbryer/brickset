"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-24T18:32:30Z","","This is a small, classic set with the minimal grey/black castle elements that you can have hours of fun with. I remember building all sorts of preposterous castle-on-wagon-wheel constructions with this set.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-02-12T07:15:15Z","Great add to the black falcon fortress","The rampart is cool and can be nicely connected to the black falcon fortress. The siege tower/ram is ok looking. This set has got a nice minifigs selection as well. I loved this set as a kid. The lion-knights did never manage to conquer the falcon rampart :)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2008-01-28T08:51:40.483Z","Laying siege","Two technic bricks with a hole in their centre and a pin make it possible to connect this rampart to other castles. Adding this rampart to other buildings is a good way to make your medieval town or castle bigger but you can also use this set without other castles. It's not necessary to add other castle stuff to have fun with it. You can play endlessly with what this set alone gives you: a rampart, a battering ram, and six minifigs. 

There is no ladder for the archer on the tower to climb up, but I like the little 1x1 brick with healdight directly above the black door. Maybe it is used to pour hot pitch on the attackers when they want to enter the castle through the door. The castle also has some hinges so you can fold it together to a quasi U-shape. But the black door could be locked with a bar as it was done with the prison in King's Castle 6080. Without a bar it's easy for the battering ram to open the door. 

The battering ram is black. It is good that another colour than grey was chosen for it. If both the castle and the battering ram were in either black or grey, this set would look very boring. The battering ram's mechanism to open the door is quite fragile. You often have to fix it. It's really annoying. The great thing about the battering ram is that the attackers aren't obliged to wait for the destruction of the door. They can just go up the ram and attack the Black Falcons without losing time by waiting for the door to be destroyed. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-04-07T07:46:41.583Z","Wham Ram Bam","This is a great mid sized set that improved on its previous incarnation 6061 by replacing the siege tower with a battling ram.  That's not the only thing that got improved.  This time around, both the factions are represented in the set with the wall going to the Black Falcons and the Ram being manned by the Gold Lions.

The wall is interestingly designed with hinges at two areas enabling it to fold into a lopsided U shape.  The hinges also enable it to be attached to both ends of either 6073 or 6074 to make a bigger castle.  The tower is also interesting built with the corner bricks to give the wall some depth and three levels.  Sadly there are no stairs on the tower.  The door is also a little bit spartan and is only kept in place by a simple barricade.  Still this is a big improvement.

The ram itself is also interesting, with stairs to the top level to enable boarding the castle parapets.  The ramming mechanism is manual (not spring loaded) and it's a bit flimsy at times, but it does work.

6 minifigs complete the set, 3 from each of the factions and this set is great alone, or together with the other castle sets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"jsosse","2009-05-02T18:42:43.14Z","So good I had two!","This set was so perfectly fit to pair with set 6080 in play that I had two of them. At one side, the Lions in their big castle and in the other the Falcons with their advanced outpost (made by conecting the two 6062 sets together). It was unending fun to play with it...",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ernst","2012-10-22T18:19:13.85Z","Battering Ram; close to perfection.","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong>: Together with the <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6074-1"">Black Falcon&#39;s Fortress </a>I consider this one of the best Classic Castle sets Lego ever made. It is complete, looks great, has good parts,&nbsp;is fun to built and you can make all known Castle&#39;s bigger with it. The only problem is to find it these days for a reasonable price.</p>

<p><strong>Building 5 bricks</strong>: It is just the simple building of a wall with a tower and a black door as entrance, nothing special but old time fun to do. The tower looks great and the hinges in the wall enable you to shape the wall in several ways. The ramtower is a stable black cart with a good working grey ramming device and is at the same time a siege tower. Both sides have their own flags.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong>: all very useful Castle parts give the opportunity to make this set in more ways than one. Hinges are always welcome as are the small green base plates and the black door. The set gives 6 great mini figures, 3 Black Falcons and 3 Crusaders all very well armed with extra weapons present behind the wall.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong>: A wall with a tower, a great siege tower with ram and for each faction 3 well armed knights gives great playability. Added to other sets the wall gives also great fun, I added it to the <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6073-1"">Knight&#39;s Castle</a> and it became great. This set gives great possibilities, just try it.</p>

<p><strong>Value 3 bricks</strong>: Compared to the price when it was for sale in the shops the price has risen enormous. Probably because it is hard to find, according to <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=6062-1"">Bricklink</a> the average used price is some &euro;75,00 - &euro;80,00 which is even more than you pay for the Black Falcon&#39;s Fortress. The 3 bricks are for that average which I consider a lot (too much??) money for 236 parts set. I got it after a lot of patience for a steal, I paid &euro;25,00 in great condition with box !!</p>

"IndyLibrarian","2014-06-22T19:42:41.793Z","Fond memories of my first set","<p>This lovely little fortified wall and battering ram was my very first LEGO set, a gift for my birthday. This set launched my LEGO obsession, especially with the Castle-themed sets.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>Really liked the black wood door. Even though this was a small set, LEGO still managed to include several wall elements, tower elements and hinged pieces! I also liked the variety of crests on the shields; both sides have two versions of their crest represented.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Six figures total - evenly matched between the Black Falcons and Crusaders.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Lots of play options, fits well with other Black Falcon sets, but can also stand alone.</p>
