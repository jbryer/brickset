<p>Issue 27 of the Lego City Comic, priced &pound;4.25 in the UK which was up from the previous issue, came with a Go-Kart driven by Gary Gear.&nbsp; Finally, after 20 issues we can now race against the Race Car from Issue 7 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/951807-1/Race-Car"">951807</a>].&nbsp; But who will win - Octan or X-Treme?</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>This time around Lego have given us the larger foil packet that opens easily and does not have really sticky glue that tends to grab the parts as they come out of the bag.&nbsp; The front says Limited Edition, like a lot of the comic sets, but it will probably turn up as an additional free set in later issues.</p>

<p>Gary is pictured crossing the finish line on the front and waving, as I assume he must have won.&nbsp; In the skies above there is a&nbsp;jet flying over.&nbsp; It could very well be the Airshow Jet set [<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60177-1/Airshow-Jet"">60177</a>] from 2018, which seems strange being a set that is a lot older than when this was released and not readily available.&nbsp; I could be wrong, and it could just be a very similar jet.</p>

<p>The 1:1 image on the back is of Gary&#39;s red race helmet.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Gary Gear has&nbsp;the exact same torso and legs as appear in the 2020 Race Boat Transport set [<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60254-1"">60254</a>], in fact the torso only appears there and in 2020&#39;s Air Race [<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60260-1/Air-Race"">60260</a>] so is new and still rare.&nbsp; His head and red race helmet are reasonably common, with his head element appearing in 2011&#39;s Power Boat Transporter [<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4643-1/Power-Boat-Transporter"">4643</a>] as well as over 50 other sets.&nbsp; With the link to the old set he might have been with the team for the last nine years?</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>The 21 parts that build the Go-Kart come together well, and are an improvement on the last offering from Issue 7 as the driver sits at a better height.&nbsp; The sand blue spoiler adds a different colour, but maybe red would have suited the car better, to match the front and the colours on Gary&#39;s race suit.&nbsp; The Issue 7 set was built up from a 2x6 plate and as such the driver sat too high, this set uses the car&nbsp;4x7 base piece and it works much better.&nbsp; However, the engine build on the older car added something that this car misses.</p>

<p>Apart from the three sand blue elements the parts should be easily obtained from most collections.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>Even though I think the colours could be switched to improve this set, I think it&#39;s a good one and goes well with the 2020 City sets.&nbsp; The parts would be&nbsp;easy enough to get, so you could build various colour versions of this set and race them.&nbsp; This is certainly worth the &pound;4.25 cover price of the comic.</p>

<p>It looks like the X-Treme team have won this race.</p>

<p>Inside the back page we see that the next issue gives us Harl Hubbs with a whacker plate and barrier.&nbsp;</p>
