The yellow forestman with the different torso is obviously Robin Hood, and the black forestman has to be Little John. The balcony hidden under the leaves was great for hiding until the soldiers got closer, and then unloosing a barrage from hidden forestmen. Also the two camouflaged entrance/exits were a great design. The only problem was, the castle soldiers were so kool, I didn't like having them OR the forestmen die. :-( All in all, a really fun set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"StormSworder","2008-03-18T15:54:31.343Z","A fine set.","Castle was at its best in the mid-to-late eighties, as this set demonstrates.  It is a secret hideout built into a cave.  Not only is the model hinged, but there is a door which opens up to reveal the cave mouth, and also a hidden side door.  The set comes with six forestmen and plenty of weapons and other things like a treasure box and goblets.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-03-31T05:00:12.63Z","Open Sesame","This is probably the only castle set influenced by Ali Baba out of Arabian Nights.  First off there's a black rock door that can be rolled to access a cave carved out of a hillside.  Of course, the cave can also be accessed by lifting up the slope or by swinging the back part of the hill away from it.

Inside the hill, the details are bare and there's one little window that partially divides the chamber into two.  A balcony adorns the &quot;tree&quot; and forms a second level, but unlike the smaller set 6054, this balcony is spartan.

The same gripe about the tree being black in the smaller set 6054 also applies here, but the design here at least tries to imitate a real tree and succeeds more than 6054, although it could still be improved.

One good thing about this set ist that there's a forestman horseman, who's one out of the 6 minifigs.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

I loved everything about this set.  The secret door, the large gate, the way it was hinged to open up to allow for interior action...everything was great!

It came with many great minifigures, featured a really creative and original design, and combined perfectly with the other Forestmen sets.  I wish I could get these sets today at a more reasonable price, as my originals have long-since been banished to the Lego graveyard in my parents basement.  ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

The best feature, being the rock door that can be rolled back.  The great tree that makes up one side of the Outpost is fantastic, with the black blocks forming one of the largest Lego trees I have ever seen in a set.

There is not always a stand out set or best to worst scale, in this case the entire subtheme is just outstanding but set each should be reviewed on its own merit.<div><br></div><div><b>Minifigures:</b></div><h4>[<b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·][</b><b>·</b><b>·]</b></h4><div><ul><li>Black and green forestman.</li><li>Brown sack/backpack.</li></ul></div><div>Robin Hood in the&nbsp;peasant/thiefs tunic gets a&nbsp;small yellow feather this time.&nbsp;You could identify characters such as Alan-A-Dale or Much The Miller's Son among the MFs but mixing their parts however you like is best.&nbsp;Best in set, I'll call Little John or Friar Tuck: small black feather and a black chemise green top plus he gets a spear and brown backpack for carrying loot. All get a bow and quiver and by 'chemise' I mean the classic mediaeval smock, not lingerie!&nbsp;A pretty impressive number of MFs for the set here. These last four merry men only come in this set, the black one being a choice minifigure. There may not have been the trendy stag's head shield in this set but it was available in most other similar sets and is not a make or break piece.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Man Cave</b></div><div>Only boys are in this set, like most others apart from the frustratingly US only&nbsp;</div><div><a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6071-1"">http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6071-1</a>. Lets not forget an early brown horse that looks excellent with a red saddle with sword attached. Its a two green baseplate start with a grey hinge, the main part of the build being in black or grey.&nbsp;The cave has some excellent slants and a window 'carved' out by way of an arch brick. A clip holds a brown axe and a hole is built for the secretive access. A couple of five stud stone panels are used with the dark stones print. and a hole brick close to the base uses a small technic axle piece to link the black rock that rolls out of place for secret entry. The back hollow goes in to the tree base while the front is covered with a double hinged broad slab of stone or fake stone considering they lift this plate and brick cover to take the horse in. This diagonal rock face gets suitable green growth over it. This makes no less than three secret entrance or escape routes! The top is plated and tiled off suggesting different textures and shape of grey rock.&nbsp;Outside is a hook held chunky rock for the saddle while the horse goes bare back and the outer build up of rock is generally thicker than I remembered which helps provide a solid, high quality overall build. Two small forest trees are added for even further effect. When all the Forestmen sets are joined, I imagine the woods, ruins and hideouts make a great landscape.</div><div><br></div><div>The tree meanwhile takes up most of the smaller baseplate, growing out of the mass of rock.&nbsp;It did not matter that brown bricks were not quite available for tree trunks, the black just added to a dark and atmospheric mediaeval kid's world. It helped massively that 'Robin Of Sherwood' was on ITV during the 1980's. Two more rock carved windows are near the base where black diagonal panels are used to good effect toward a more organic shape melded with thick parts of stone. A grey plate floor half way up overhangs the cave when both bases are closed shut. That hinge simply allows play access for an excellent imagination zone within. Black arches are used on upward slants like looping tree growth or carved/shaped boughs. The tree then becomes fort like with a battlement style balcony. The limbs and branches are finished with slants finally holding the deep green tree leaf pieces, the tree now satisfyingly fat trunked with plenty of growth. A red flag sits on top, possibly unwisely to spoil all the camouflage but its probably a signal to hide the loot: two yellow 'gold' goblets in a brown chest.</div><div><br></div><div><b>Emerald Camouflage</b></div><div>Forestmen's Crossing does also have a hollow tree, mini-cave and hidden treasure with a bridge to boot and you get Maid Marian but it has more ruins or infrastructure and less compact and solid execution but there's&nbsp;little difference but personal choice. Then the Forestmen's Hideout is attractive as the original tree they all meet around but has less camouflage.&nbsp;I had forgotten the excitement over purchasing Camouflaged Outpost and the further surprises when building just such an excellent outpost.&nbsp;I would see this as a favourite but it is certainly full of more features than other Forestmen sets and has just an emergent polish to the design that pushes it a step further with a fantastic build, parts, minifigures count and quality, play potential and great model. This whole subtheme is a treasure but you could roughly justify this one as a polished gem.</div>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"AETerry","2010-10-14T10:20:31.85Z","Outpost Review","<p>I remember when this set first came out... the first of the Forestmen subtheme in Castle. And it was so different then what they'd been doing before with Castles, forts, wagons, ect and just changing out what army was in the seat of a new catapult design or castle, ect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

"Ernst","2015-01-04T18:51:33.677Z","Camouflaged Outpost, Robin Hoods treasure cave.","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong> : This is a great set from a great (sub)theme, the Forestmen. Reviewing a set from 1987 in a time when you have the great Hobbit sets with Elfs is double hard because it easy but unfair to compare them. Although Lego had a lot&nbsp;less parts to choose from than now this set is still great in parts, construction and playability, I think today it would still be a huge succes.</p>

<p><strong>Building 5 bricks</strong> : Old school building with a lot of small bricks and several panels make this great fun, it is not too difficult. You start with building the cave on 2 small base plates connected with hinges. It has 2 hidden entrances, a side door and the hidden hatch. The top is camouflaged with tree branches with leaves&nbsp;and has a turret for a guard. When finished you can close the 2 parts with a lovely building as result.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 4 bricks</strong> : Not the full 5 because there are some things left to wish. The amount of 6&nbsp;Merry men is great but maybe 4 and 2 opposite mini figures would have been better. And maybe some brown parts for the tree branches instead of black would have been nice. But overall great parts, 2 trees and 11 leaf parts, 2 printed wall panels, a load of black arches and all very useful parts for MOC&#39;s.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 4 bricks</strong> : As mentioned before some enemy many figures would have been great and would have made it 5 bricks. But the set has great playability of course with the 6 mini figures including a horseman, hidden entries, a treasure and the possibility to open it.</p>

<p><strong>Value 4 bricks</strong> : The 1987 retail price, being I guess some &euro; 25.00, was great. According to <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=6066-1"">Bricklink</a> the average used&nbsp;price is nowadays some&nbsp;52 euro&#39;s which is expensive but worth it for a collector. If i had to choose between a new Hobbit set with Elves or this one for &euro;50.00 I would grab this great set anytime !</p>

"joee","2012-02-23T10:38:46.9Z","Oh how I wish I had chosen this as a child.","<p>This is the first Forestman set from wayyy back in '87.&nbsp; For an introductory set you receive quite a lot of figures (six!) and the set displays the sneakiness and cleverness of what the Forestmen would be all about in later sets.</p>
<p>Pros</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent selection and amount of minifigs.&nbsp; This includes the rare black torso figure and a black feather for his cap.&nbsp; Also each figure has his own plume wheel. Oh and a brown horse. (it was rare at the time) 
<li>Playability.&nbsp; The secret black rock door, hinged roof and hinged opening on the two baseplates makes for a lot of sneaky ways to get in and out of the fort.&nbsp; I can't believe how much was cramed into this set.&nbsp; It even has a tower. 
<li>Good Starter Set.&nbsp; For it's price at the time you received a great army starter for a Forestmen army.&nbsp; Of all the FM sets this should be the first one on anyone's list.</li></ul>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<ul>
<li>The price of finding this on the market I find is on the high end side for a medium sized set.&nbsp; I think the amount of figures you get and the black feather drive up this price.&nbsp; I wouldn't say it was a huge setback as you can always find deals on it.</li></ul>
<p>I never had this set as a child. I regretfully chose another toy instead and it still haunts me to this day.&nbsp; It would have been my first larger castle set but I waited an ended up getting 6071.&nbsp; I tired building it multiple times in my youth but after finally getting my hands on one a few years ago I found the real mcoy puts anything I built to shame.&nbsp; After seeing my son play with this and the other Forestmen sets, would rank is as the best just narrowly beating out 6077.&nbsp; I find the extra figures and the multiple secrets of the set just beat out the large 6077 tower. </p>",TRUE,5,4,5,5,5
"GameThug","2014-08-05T22:46:37.687Z","Defines the Subtheme","<p>Though it&#39;s not a Castle, I think this is one of the top sets from the Theme.&nbsp; In terms of character, uniqueness, and playability, this set cannot be beat.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;m not a &quot;piece&quot; expert, so I can&#39;t say what is unique or rare, but I can say that the leafy-fronds, the treasure chest, and the goblets all stand out as fun and interesting components.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Robin Hood, Little John, and 4 Redshirts.&nbsp; You might pick them out as Will Scarlet (red details) and Alan-a-Dale, but everyone knows who the top two are.&nbsp; Hand a kid this <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Robin-Hood-Illustrated-Charles-Vivian/dp/0811833992/ref=sr_1_13?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1407274916&amp;sr=1-13&amp;keywords=robin+hood"">book </a>and this set, and they&#39;re set for weeks of entertainment.</p>

<p>Cool hats, archery gear, and a basket backpack.&nbsp; Love &#39;em.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A concealed main door, a secret door, a skeletal battlement, lots of branches and limbs to climb/stand on--a stall inside for your horse.&nbsp; There&#39;s lots of room inside for everyone to hide out if the Sheriff comes by.&nbsp; The set hinges open for increased play environments.</p>

<p>Top marks for layout and design.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set defines the Forestmen subtheme.&nbsp; Other kits are larger or more &quot;foresty&quot;, but this is the perfect fusion of the grey of Castle combined with the forest growth of Forestmen.&nbsp; It&#39;s healthy number of MFs (6! and a horse!) establishes the Forestmen as an instant army.</p>

<p>If you don&#39;t have it, buy it.</p>

"rab1234","2019-02-07T15:43:59.9Z","Nearly Perfect Classic Castle for the Era","<h2><strong>Overall Rating</strong></h2>

<p>5/5.&nbsp; For 1987, this is an amazing set.&nbsp; Awesome, playability, parts, and figures.</p>

<h2><strong>Building Experience</strong></h2>

<p>I had this one as a kid and recently rebuilt from my childhood bins.&nbsp; Even with the difficulty in finding all the parts mixed together with 50 other sets, the build came together sort of quickly.&nbsp; It&#39;s a fun build and there are some good techniques as well. The only thing I would say is that it would probably look better with the tree being brown (although the needed parts in brown didn&#39;t exist at the time).</p>

<h2><strong>Parts</strong></h2>

<p>Lots and lots of trees and leaves which for the time period were fairly rare.&nbsp; A brown horse, a variety of forest men (including the very rare black feather), lots of archers, a treasure chest, my favorite printed grey castle wall piece, etc.&nbsp; Excellent parts on the whole.</p>

<h2><strong>Playability</strong></h2>

<p>Fantastic playability with 6 minifigs, a horse, and an interesting base for them.&nbsp; The secret entrances are awesome and provided for a ton of fun.&nbsp; It helps to have another castle set to have these guys have someone to fight against, but even without it, you could come up with some scenarios given the differences in the types of forest men included.</p>

<h2><strong>Value for the Money</strong></h2>

<p>I see $23 as the original cost which would be about $50 today.&nbsp; That would definitely be worth it in my opinion in 1987.&nbsp; You can still pick up a complete one for &lt; $100 on Bricklink and that&#39;s still a good value for the history, nostalgia, and quality of the set.</p>

"Almabeach","2019-02-24T02:02:05.113Z","Beautiful and underated","<p>This is one of my most cherished Lego sets. I really loved the Forestmen and I wish I got more of them as a kid. I used to play wars between these guys and the ones from my <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/6074-1/Black-Falcon-s-Fortress"">Black Fortress</a> castle or even against my Pirates even though it did&#39;nt make historical sense... I always like these guys as I saw them as underdogs against the bigger guys.</p>

<p>It is not a complicated build although you don&#39;t really understand what you&#39;re building until it all comes together at the end. It really plays well with the whole camouflage theme as there is two secret entrances and a lot of green leaves. There is also the added bonus of being able to open the building and having a different angle to play with.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://farm8.staticflickr.com/7813/47139475202_3d5e0fe62f.jpg"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>There is not really any unique or rare parts to make the building. The minifigs are another story as I lost a lot of the feathers, hats and accessories over the years. I even lost the yellow forestman which I believe is Robin Hood and that makes me very sad to only have five of the six figs. I also lost the neck basket for the black fig.</p>

<p>As you can see I was able to make up for the lost hats and feathers with regular hair, castle feathers and a pirate hat. I hope I can replace those eventually as with my lost Robin Hood...</p>

<p>So If you have the opportunity to find this set, I highly recommend it. I wish the Forestmen could make a comeback...</p>
