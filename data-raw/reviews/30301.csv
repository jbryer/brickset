Overall dissatisfaction and disappointment with the whole Mario experience. &nbsp;I feel Lego is trying to capitalise on nostalgia with poorly designed sets. Only a few studs hold every thing together. Very little playability. Yes the sets can be rearranged and &nbsp;rebuilt but nothing really lines up.&nbsp;</p>
