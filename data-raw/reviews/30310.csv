<p>No - I haven&#39;t built the model. I started to re-create the set as soon as pictures got published in June. I have done that in the past years for a couple of sets (cf. reviews of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42092-1/"">42092</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42079-1/"">42079</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42075-1/"">42075</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42102-1/"">42102</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42108-1/"">42108</a>) before.</p>

<p>On the cement mixer I decided to include modifications = improvements from start.</p>

<h3>Impressions of the (Original) Set</h3>

<p>Finally, a new truck idea in a good scale. A cement mixer was only available in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/query-5472"">Lego City line</a> before. The set designers chose to use a special, big drum piece to implement a play function: The drum can be filled with Lego pieces (bricks) and unloaded by a technic function.</p>

<p>What I like: Bright respectively classic blue is back: However only as supporting element as the main colour would be dark blue. There are few - rather small - sets in the past years with that shade of blue: <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42071-1/"">42071</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42063-1/"">42063</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42062-1/"">42062</a>, <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42045-1/"">42045</a>. The last one with main colour was <a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/42042-1/"">42042</a>.</p>

<p>The truck could have possibly been designed with only three axles: There appears to be spare area between cabin and support of the drum. (The benefit of four axles is that there is plenty of room for modifications, see below).</p>

<p>The drum can be operated from either the wheels, e.g. turning when the truck is pushed around or by a manual crank. This can be selected by a switch.</p>

<p>The cabin cannot be tilted forward to show the engine beneath (cf. <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42098-1/"">42098</a>). The setup of the hand-of-god steering control prohibits this.</p>

<h3>Criticism</h3>

<p>The water tank, e.g. the white &#39;thing&#39; at the drum&#39;s support looks awkwardly squarish. Something in the shape of <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/design-75974"">pneumatics tank</a> would have been nice.</p>

<p>The cement drum is missing the funnel to feed the drum.</p>

<p>As with most recent vehicles turning radius can be expected to be bad: That is it will be too large to have a nice play experience when driving the truck.</p>

<p>It could be expected that the transmission of the drum from wheels is a direct one when engaged. This will result in unloading of the drum when the truck is pushed backwards for some distance.</p>

<p>Thus I decided not to recreate the model but also develop improvements. However, I would stick as much as possible to the overall shape of the model.</p>

<h3>Improvements</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Steering setup for smaller turning radius. I have created a different chassis for <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/42108-1/"">42108</a> Mobile Crane before.</li>
	<li>Special transmission from wheels to drum so that it would turn only in one direction regardless of direction of drive.</li>
	<li>Modify cabin to have better openable doors and ability to tilt forward.</li>
	<li>Add funnel to feed the drum.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is current status (click on picture for more information in Eurobrick forum):</p>

<p>Eventually I will get the drum pieces to complete the model and test drive. Price of a single drum pieces is 13 &euro; from LEGO website (checked on 1.8.20).</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>This is nice addition to the Technic line. Both the set itself and, if you would like to go further, also as an inspiration. The -very- special drum pieces are elementary for the play function of this set.</p>

"snazzybricks928","2021-04-21T01:24:16.583Z","No mixed feelings!","<p>42112 Concrete Mixer Truck is a Technic set that retails for $119.99, and comes with an expansive amount of functions and some new colours of parts.</p>

<div class=""description"">
<p><b><u>Pros:</u></b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Wide assortment of blue and earth blue Technic elements</li>
	<li>Stickers aren&#39;t essential to the aesthetic, although they improve it</li>
	<li>Decently sized</li>
	<li><strong>Extremely</strong> functional</li>
	<li>Beautiful aesthetics</li>
	<li>4-wheel steering</li>
	<li>Cabin interior</li>
	<li>&ldquo;Gearbox,&rdquo; that switches the drum from manual (crank) rotation, rear-axles-driven rotation, or neutral</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Cons:</u></b></p>

<ul>
	<li>Poor turning radius</li>
	<li>High PPP ratio, some cut corners (gaps, unfinished areas like the water tank)</li>
	<li>No funnel to refill the drum</li>
	<li>Quite loud while operating a full drum</li>
	<li>Some copies of the set (including mine) had an engine design that would make the driveshaft get stuck, and the truck would stop. Fortunately, there&#39;s an easy fix for this.</li>
	<li>The drum elements are not protected in the box, and thus they will most likely get small scuffs or scratches.</li>
</ul>

<p><b><u>Overall Rating: 4.8</u></b></p>

<p>This is an <em>incredible</em> Technic set, with tons of playability and many features. I would rather the price be $10-20 lower, as $120 for 1063 pieces (excluding the 100 &ldquo;concrete&rdquo; elements) seems steep. However, the aesthetics are wonderful, and the size isn&#39;t too bad either. Overall, I would recommend this to people who are just getting in to Technic, as it&#39;s an excellent example of what the theme is. Or, if you have prior Technic experience, I would also recommend it, as I enjoyed it immensely.</p>
