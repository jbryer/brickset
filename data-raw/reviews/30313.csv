<p>The large, densely packed box is mainly&nbsp;Black in the current 18+ style with a&nbsp;lid/base rather than the usual flap ended box. &nbsp;When the model is fully built, it can&nbsp;be slightly disassembled and packed away in it. &nbsp;This is genuinely a plus point&nbsp;for me, as often completed models can&#39;t be put back&nbsp;into the box for storage. &nbsp;There are multiple bags, numbered 1-21 (some are in a secondary&nbsp;internal box) and some additional plates and bags of the lovely gold tubes that make the strings.</p>

<p>The instructions book is hefty, with over 800&nbsp;steps, some nice photographs and background information about the subject and the designer. &nbsp;I was slightly&nbsp;dreading the all-black instructions pages which bedevil construction of the&nbsp;crocodile locomotive set, but I was pleased to see it was the usual light background so it was easy to follow.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>I spread the build over a period of four days and it&#39;s certainly a very enjoyable, immersive&nbsp;experience. &nbsp;While the completed model is largely black, there are plenty of other coloured elements and some great internal detail which captures the flamboyant but classy look of a classic grand. &nbsp;The coloured elements are in the main authentic too rather than rainbow colours to aid construction. &nbsp;Dark green tiles echo felt pads on the keys for example.</p>

<p>You start by constructing the base and one of the sides, adding in the motorised bar which later operates the keys. &nbsp;The sides are added, curving nicely&nbsp;using a sideways technique and then the soundboard is added, using tiles to simulate a lovely wood strip effect. &nbsp;Multiple gold elements add to the luxury. &nbsp;The strings are made from gold tubes,&nbsp;and they can be a bit fiddly to ensure they lie flat and look like they&#39;re parallel. &nbsp;Later on in the build, the dampener&nbsp;mechanism actually helps to flatten these out, but if you take time here to rotate them to make them as straight as possible it will pay off. &nbsp;The keyboard is constructed separately&nbsp;and&nbsp;it can be removed from the finished build. &nbsp;The finished keyboard is authentic looking, yet still endearingly recognisable as Lego. &nbsp;The latter stages of the build involve large amounts of black bricks, building the keyboard lid and main lid, plus music stand and adjustable piano stool.</p>

<p>There are three powered up elements: hub, motion sensor and motor which are installed before the build gets too far advanced. &nbsp;The hub is easily accessible in the finished build for powering up and changing batteries although there is a sizeable gap at one side of the flap and it can swing open a little too easily.</p>

<p>I was pleased to see little repetition over the course of the build (the most repetitive sections are for the string&nbsp;hammers and dampeners but it&#39;s over pretty quickly).</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>The piano lid, the keyboard lid, the stand, the adjustable stool and the dampener pedal&nbsp;all make the set very playable. &nbsp;You will love showing it off to people! &nbsp;But obviously the main selling point&nbsp;of this set is that you can actually &quot;play&quot; the instrument. &nbsp;When you install the app on your phone and first connect it to the hub, it goes through a process of setting up and then you can choose from a mode where you can play a tune, or listen to a tune while they keys move themselves. &nbsp;You can use the music stand to prop your phone up, although there is a great 6x6 printed tile included for show.</p>

<p>In user play&nbsp;mode, there are a small number of&nbsp;tunes to chose from. &nbsp;The app presents&nbsp;the sheet music and off you go. &nbsp;In actual fact you can press any key to trigger the next note in the sequence so it doesn&#39;t matter if you can read music and play the piano at all. &nbsp;While&nbsp;this is a nice feature&nbsp;quite how long the novelty will last needs to be seen, but it will certainly be something to show off!</p>

<p>I find the self playing function more&nbsp;clich&eacute;ed personally because the sequence and speed through which the&nbsp;keys move is&nbsp;the same for every tune you select. &nbsp;I&#39;d have thought the Powered Up system could have sped up/slowed down the motor in sync with the music to perhaps make the illusion a little more believable. &nbsp;The motor is quiet in operation and doesn&#39;t spoil the illusion much.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>The set is enormous (far bigger than I&#39;d imagined) and has a great shape, capturing the lines and curves of a classic piano, from the lid to the legs. &nbsp;I&#39;d say it&#39;s more of a Baby Grand than a Grand because it doesn&#39;t have the length, but the main features of a Grand Piano are beautifully captured and presented. &nbsp;The glossy black bricks look absolutely right (get a micro fibre cloth after &nbsp;building to buff away the fingerprints!).&nbsp;The playability is a nice feature, but some more tunes and/or user submitted music might be nice&nbsp;to keep it fresh. &nbsp;It&#39;s solid, strong and heavy. &nbsp;</p>

<p>One slight downside for me is that following playback the keys don&#39;t reset properly, looking all neatly lined up. &nbsp;There is a feature in the app&nbsp;which turns the motor backwards for a moment, which is supposed to put the keys back to flat and aligned but it doesn&#39;t quite work. &nbsp;I personally just use the stop button and guess. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>That for me, is the only bug in an otherwise stunning build experience. &nbsp;Bravo!</p>

<p>Just an awesome model! I give it a 4 rating for playability because I thought that the Piano actually played music by itself. Silly me. It does play, but the sound comes from your cell phone. I should have known.</p>

<p>I would highly recommend buying this set!&nbsp;</p>

"andytheafol","2022-01-01T04:08:59.12Z","Criminally underrated","<p>The Lego Ideas Grand Piano (3662) sparked some controversy when initially released. Lego advertised the set as playable when using the companion app when in reality, the functionality was exaggerated and&nbsp;is extremely underwhelming. That said, the Lego Ideas Grand Piano is probably the single classiest display piece The Lego Group has ever released, still featuring a ton of impressive play functionality.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While pressing a key will not trigger the corresponding note, it is still incredibly satisfying. During the build process, it may seem like keys are sticking, but once the key bed is inserted into the piano, and the weight of the dampers is added, sticking really isn&#39;t an issue. The keys will sometimes rest unevenly after play, but it is easy to realign them. Arguably even more satisfying than pressing a key is lifting all the dampers at once with the sustain pedal. The left and middle pedals serve no functionality and are for display only.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building the keys can be grueling, but feature some of the most interesting&nbsp;techniques in the build.&nbsp;The shaping of the keys is incredible and assembling&nbsp;the Technic&nbsp;functionality is&nbsp;satisfying. Overall the build process is pretty straightforward, with the most notable element being that nearly the entire piano body uses SNOT techniques, leaving nearly no studs showing.</p>

<p>The piano bench is also a super cool build. The height is adjustable with enough resistance to prevent&nbsp;the bench from being lowered without turning the knob. The cushion makes excellent use of inverted round tiles; one of the best parts usages in the set.</p>

<p>While the motor functions and companion app probably bumped the price of the set, price per piece sticklers should still be content with PPP of 9.5 cents. The set features mostly large pieces as well, and very few 1by1s, so this isn&#39;t a case of Lego &quot;hyper-inflating&quot; the piece count&nbsp;with tiny pieces. The set only has around 30 extra pieces, which is very little&nbsp;for a set of this size but acts as&nbsp;evidence that the set isn&#39;t filled with tiny tiles.</p>

<p>Regarding size, the final model is quite large. The build feels very substantial and worth the price point. The studless exterior makes this a great set to ease Lego into room decor. The set features wheels, but the set is heavy enough where the set will never slide around on its own. No need to worry about the set rolling&nbsp;off a table!</p>

<p>One minor nitpick is that the soundboard does not extend to the highest notes of the piano, leaving strings that are not connected to anything on one side. This isn&#39;t really noticeable from a distance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, the Lego Ideas Grand Piano is one of the best-looking display models Lego has ever released. The set screams class and is probably the best set any self-conscious AFOL could slip into a common area without fear of being judged.&nbsp;</p>
