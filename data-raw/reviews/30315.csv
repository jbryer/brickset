<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures: There is total 10 minifigures in this set. It&#39;s kinda great amount, I guess. Before I bought this set, I wasn&#39;t sure was there one or two of those &quot;gentlemans&quot;, but at least I got two of them. So the 8 last minifigures are: Two ghosts, with the same design. Double face, a smiley one &amp; a sad one. I really like those &quot;legs&quot;. Then there is a skeleton <em>(funny fact: that is the third twin &quot;gentleman&quot;, but he is already dead)</em>. It has a normal top hat. Then there is a guy with a wheelchair. He wears a sweater &amp; dark blue&nbsp;trousers. Then there is a girl with black shirt/hoodie&nbsp;<em>(I am not really sure).&nbsp;</em>She wears dark bluish grey trousers. Then there is 3 more minifigures. One of them wears blue trousers, one black, and one dark blue ones. I also really like the prints on the shirts. Some of the hair pieces are also looking great&nbsp;<em>(most of them are tho&nbsp;pretty common)</em>.</p>

<p>Play Features: I was actually a bit disappointed with the play features. Not too many little things to do. You can open the front door with a button and the free fall tower inside the haunted house works very well. Nothing else really...</p>

<p>The Build: I love it! Looks super nice from the front and has some nice details inside. Also, there are&nbsp;some so many other things inside&nbsp;the build, like piano, painting, tables, magic ball, cashier table and attic space. The inside part is really detailed, as well the front too. I don&#39;t really like the look of the back side... It could be better, but whatever. It&#39;s fine, I guess. I also like how the free fall tower was made. It used a lot of those small chain pieces and couple bigger ones, where the free fall tower&#39;s wagon will be. I also like how the build uses candles as a &quot;light&quot;. The finished build is so tall! 68cm in total. Pretty awesome, right?</p>

<p>Is it worth it?: I think yes! For amusement park fan or just Lego fan overall. It&#39;s really detailed, it has good minifigures, working free fall tower... The list continues. I bought this set from a little discount (like 8%). There are 3231 pieces in total, and the price is around 299,95&euro; on Lego.com. Even tho&nbsp;it&#39;s just 3231 pieces for 300&euro;... I just think it&#39;s worth the price, because of the height and how nice it looks like in shelf. Sorry for the short review and have a nice day!</p>
