<p>This is a great looking iconic model and was pretty&nbsp;fun to build. The build process didn&#39;t include too many duplicated assemblies so kept you engaged.<br />
Cool, interactive features were paced out well and resulted in some fun rewards early in the build process. If you want a more authentic 1980s version its simple to convert it close enough and leave out the rust&nbsp;stickers. &nbsp;<br />

<p>The Bad :&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Multiple&nbsp;of my windows were scuffed or scratched.<br />
Lego REALLY needs&nbsp;to start shipping all of the large/UCS&nbsp;sets&nbsp;with better protection for large clear parts.<br />
Maybe a cardboard box like they use for strings and rubber band parts.</p>

<p>Multiple&nbsp;of my windows were scuffed or scratched.</p>

<p>&nbsp;All those Afterlife version rust stickers are a bad contrast to the shiny white pieces.</p>

<p>Overall a great kit with&nbsp;a few minor&nbsp;problems that could have been avoided.<br />
It would have been even better with the instruction options and parts to build both the original and Afterlife ECTO-1 versions.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading and please rate my review helpful.</p>

Awesome features and most importantly wicked solid so it&#39;s really playable too. I generally let my 7 y/o daughter play with my sets, that aren&#39;t delicate display pieces, and she loves it too. Playing with the set she got interested in the source material so we watched the 2 original movies, which she loved. The feeling of nostalgia building this set and then being able to pass my interests along to my daughter was, idk how to put into words, just wicked awesome.&nbsp;</p>
