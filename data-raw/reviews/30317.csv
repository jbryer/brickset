I must admit that I am no true fan of the direction Lego has taken with these sets since they started with Santa&rsquo;s House back in 2014 (<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10245-1/Santa-s-Workshop"">10245</a>). The sets have become more Fantasy than Winter Village and the designs are getting somewhat more childish than before.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:11px"">Nevertheless I buy them as a completionist and lover of Christmas decorations. When starting my Elf Club House build, I wasn&rsquo;t all that excited. I am not convinced of the new box designs for 18+ from a design perspective as for the idea that these sets give that they are &lsquo;No Children&nbsp;Allowed&rsquo;. Together with those new boxes come instructions printed on black paper. I don&rsquo;t know when and why they though this would be classy and all, but they simply are not. They are difficult and sometimes obnoxious to read even so combined with the glossy paper they are on. Please do reconsider instructions on white/light paper. I guess it would even be more eco-friendly.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:11px"">The build itself turned out to be more interesting than expected. There are some nice parts, techniques and ideas worked into this. And although Fantasy oriented, it could very well serve as a more classic winter village house.The set however is in my opinion not without its faults.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:11px"">The tilting beds, how cute and original they are, simply block the entire top floor. And together with those beds is a light brick which serves&nbsp;no purpose whatsoever. Whereas previous Winter Village models with light bricks gave a beautiful outside look, the Elf Club House seems dead from the outside looking in.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:11px"">The cookie/waffle maker is a great feature in the set but I don&rsquo;t understand why they just didn&rsquo;t incorporate&nbsp;it within the build of the house itself. True, it is attached, but being just linked with some hinges makes it look off.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:11px"">The minifigure selection is also off. 4 minifigures is fair but some distinction between them would be nice. And why does only one elf have&nbsp;a scarf to go outside?</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:11px"">Elf Club House is a paradoxical set. Where it still sits within the Fantasy corner, it reaches back to the classic Winter Village houses. And while it incorporates more and more cleaver features than the previous couple of sets, it does it in a wonky way.</p>

<p style=""text-align:justify; margin-bottom:11px"">Elf Club House has lifted the quality of the Winter Village sets again somewhat. Hopefully 2021 will see a renaissance of this classic and well-loved theme.</p>
