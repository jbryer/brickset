I spent hours playing with this set when I was a kid, and it really is a wonderful model.  Tons of tree pieces and a unique baseplate make this set a rare and wonderful classic.  I really hope they re-release this sometime...  Overall, if you want some forestmen and if you want a great model with a lot of useful pieces, this is a flawless set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-03-31T08:15:32.38Z","Hot cross buns","This isn't the first castle set with a female, but the fact that it is a US only set makes it a little rare... until the advent of ebay.  The baseplate has a river printed on it, again, another new thing for castle.

Design wise though, the hidden entry to the tower is better than the one on 6066 and the tower generally is better done than either of the two earlier sets.  The tree on the other bank of the river is also rather well done, but the general critique of the black trunk applies here as well.  The bridge is located sufficiently high enough to make it interesting.  The idea that the bridge is accessable only by ladder up the tree is also interesting.  Rounding up the figures from the wrench is another horseman, which is always useful for the forestmen.

One of the best forestman set overall taking into account all the plus points, although it could still be better.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-03-18T16:00:42.09Z","Another great Forestmen set.","This is another Forestmen set which was never released over here, but thanks to e-bay I was able to track it down.  I'm glad I did, as it's great.  The set consists of a bridge between a large tree and a tower.  It's built onto an unusual baseplate bearing a stream/river, and has plenty of little details such as a hidden cave for a treasure box, a Forestman shield and plenty of green tree parts and armed minifigs (including a rare female Forestwoman minifig).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"YeahYeahYouWere","2007-11-08T10:57:18.75Z","Another Great Forestmen Set","Like the other Forestmen sets, this is one of my favorite sets.  While it does not open up like the other Forestmen sets did, it still offers a lot of playability, and of course, the somewhat secret door is pretty neat.  It included 5 minifigures, which was awesome and led to some great imaginary battles.  Throw in the rope bridge high in the trees and you could really build some suspenseful scenes!

Once again I find this set to be imaginative and original.  It surprises me that the Forestmen sets never really got old, as I appreciated each one for many different things.  On the whole this is a great series and I would love to be able to recover this series from my parent's old basement!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"neonveins","2009-07-31T03:27:28.95Z","Awesome playset stands the test of time","I've had this set in and out of my closet depths every other year for the past decade. And it never ceases to amaze me.

As far as small play sets go, you can't get better than this, with the 3 levels of height, multiple branches, a ladder, an interesting bridge, and a hidden treasure room, it can put out a lot of interesting concepts and play times. It works extremely well when mixed small castle sets like boats and wagons, and is a great set piece for a forest man/knight scuffle. Not to mention the obvious chunk of mini-figs included, what with all their accessories and awesome woodsman clothes!

I'm extremely glad that I've kept all the pieces since I got it, if you can find this set for a reasonable price, say on eBay, buy it.

Pros: Extremely enjoyable play set
        Good set of mini-figs(only set to include forest woman)
        Works well with many other sets, from then and now

Cons: Nothing major, maybe could have included an enemy or two",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2011-01-21T15:32:41.68Z","Forestmen's Crossing Review","<p>If memory serves right.... this is one of the last Forestmen sets before the introduction of Wolfpack and then Dark Forest.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As the last in the Forestmen theme, it was a great finale to the theme. The entire set is based on a fairly unique base plate with a printed river (more of a stream really) cutting through it. On one side of the set is a large tree with a ladder for climbing up to the top. A bridge allows for access over the bridge if a minifigure doesn't feel daring enough to swing from the vine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other side of the river is a slight Castle/Tower build built around or having a tree coming out of it. There is a hidden rock door that opens up where the Forestmen can hide their treasure using the yellow round plate 1x1 elements for gold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all there are 5 minifigures in this set. One of which is a rare female forestman figure, the only one you can get her from shy of one of the collector packs for vintage minifgures that Lego has sold recently. For this era of Castle, female figures were rare, as we move into the 2000's they have been becoming more and more common to come by. Finishing out this set is a white horse, which are always good and fun to have for scenes.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"BelgianBricker","2019-08-05T10:39:13.613Z","Not as legendary as one might expect...","<p>In the late 80&#39; and early 90&#39; LEGO decided to make some of the sets from some of their best themes NA-release only. Among these were, for example,&nbsp;Blacktron&#39;s flagship &quot;the renegade&quot;, Space Police&#39;s &quot;isolation lock-up base&quot; and the Forestmen&#39;s &quot;Forestmen Crossing&quot; set.&nbsp;<br />
These days, these sets are, for Europeans, hard to come by, so I was very lucky to be able to pick the Forestmen Crossing set up from Ebay a couple of years ago for a very very reasonable price.</p>

<p>I wanted this set in&nbsp;my collection because I was/am a heavy Forestmen fan. It was the castle theme I looked at with amazement as a child, and I notice that the different sets still have this kind of magical, mystery appeal to me as an adult.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Forestmen&#39;s Crossing set features a small, stone build, 3 story hideout with a hidden entrance on both sides at the bottom floor. Some trees have grown in and around the structure, giving it a symbiotic and ruin-like appearance. It is a recurring concept&nbsp;in the Forestmen sets and it works perfectly for the theme.&nbsp;As mentioned, the bottom floor houses a secret room you can use to store a treasure chest.&nbsp;It can be accessed by two moveable stone walls, covered with some greenery. It is very similar to that of the &quot;camouflaged Outpost&quot;, not at all a bad thing.&nbsp;A nice Forestmen&nbsp;shield decorates the front of the build. These shields are hard to come by, so it is always fun to see them in a set. On the second floor we have a little house with terrace. The third floor is a lookout which also functions as the landing platform for the rope-bridge.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other side of the bridge is connected to a hollow tree with a nice brown ladder hidden in its trunk. The idea is that you go into the tree, climb up the ladder and use the rope bridge to access the Forestmen hideout on the other side of the river. This river is printed on a unique baseplate that is the highlight of this set. It is simply stunning. Apart from the river there is also a little well printed on the side. A great place for a horse to have a drink.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set comes with an abundance of minifigures: 4 male forestmen, 1 white horse&nbsp;and the exclusive female figure, Lady marian(?). That&#39;s a lot of minifigures for a set this size. The torso-printing isn&#39;t on par with what LEGO achieves in printing these days, but&nbsp;nostalgia is rather strong, so no complaints here :).&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set is a must-have for every Forestmen-fan, but it also comes with some flaws:</p>

<p>-the lack of a soldier figure&nbsp;to act as an enemy, maybe&nbsp;with a little boat or raft, limits the playability of this set. There is only so much you can do with a set that doesn&#39;t have good and bad guys. It&#39;s the same problem the&nbsp;&quot;Camouflaged Outpost&quot; suffered from. The &quot;River Fortress&quot; however got it right. Therefor, my advice would be to combine this set with some of the smaller castle ships that LEGO released during that period like: &quot;king&#39;s oarsmen&quot; or &quot;Battle dragon&quot;. The rope-bridge, vines, river and little building with treasure will make a lot more sense.<br />
<br />
-the hollow tree is one of the lesser tree-designs. It looks rather weird and unfinished. I don&#39;t mind the black colorscheme: it is part of the nostalgia (and brown simply wasn&#39;t a common color), but I do mind the way the tree is build up and the way some of the branches are placed. When looked from certain angles it simply looks odd. The tree will benefit greatly from adding some branches and/or making it a bit taller.<br />
<br />
-the hide-out is rather Spartan in its design. LEGO didn&#39;t put much effort in their interiors in the early days, but this structure feels&nbsp;really, really empty. Something simple like a&nbsp;small table or a little fireplace on the second floor would have made a world of difference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>All in all this is a nice set, but alas overrated. I understand where it&#39;s cult status is coming from: the &quot;Forestmen&quot; are to this day a very beloved LEGO theme, it was the last set from this theme and it&#39;s lovely baseplate&nbsp;and exclusive female figure&nbsp;together with its&nbsp;limited release ensured&nbsp;&#39;a-legend-in-the-making&quot;.</p>
