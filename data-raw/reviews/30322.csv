The packaging looks great, all colours in separate bags etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The instructions are easy to follow and the instruction book is great.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>I picked the picture that I wanted to build first and happy with how it looks.&nbsp;<br />
The downside of this build is that it&rsquo;s boring, there isn&rsquo;t any skill required, just the ability to follow how many lego dots of which colour are on each line. The entire build took approximately 4 hours.&nbsp;<br />
When I originally decided to buy this set, I thought I would&nbsp;build/disassemble&nbsp;each of the pictures over time. However after building one.&nbsp;I won&rsquo;t disassemble to build another.&nbsp;</p>
