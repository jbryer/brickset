&nbsp;<br />
The box contains a beautiful&nbsp;instruction book that covers three suit variants, 15 packets of 1x1round studs,&nbsp;9 base modules,&nbsp;two bags containing the brick separator, technic&nbsp;hanging brackets, components for the frame and technic pins to hold the modules together.</p>

<p>Each module is 16 studs square and is completed by adding round 1x1 studs of varying colours,&nbsp;there are 15 different coloured studs used to make the picture. Each module has its own page in the instruction manual featuring a key showing the studs with a number assigned to each, these numbers are the assigned to a diagram&nbsp;of the module I highly recommend being in a well lit environment or ideally using Lego&#39;s digital instructions if you can as the colours are easier to differentiate because in my opinion the printing is a bit dark.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build starts with the top left module and works across until three have been completed these are then pinned together then the middle row is added then the bottom row, finally the frame and hanging brackets are&nbsp;added. The end result is remarkably sturdy and attractive.</p>

<p>There are three suit variants all portrayed as portraits these are&nbsp;the &nbsp;Mk3, Hulkbuster&nbsp;Mk1 &quot;Veronica&quot; and the Mk&nbsp;85. To say which is best is subjective but although my personal favourite is most certainly the Mk3, the Hulkbuster has its charms and the Mk85 is probably the best shaded of the three.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Build time from scratch was about 6-7&nbsp;hours per image however if you had to deconstruct and sort colours to build the variants this would increase the time by quite a bit. I started off building as per the instructions but by the time I had got to the Mk85 I was building across all modules&nbsp;in single colours to vary the experience and found it actually shaved the time down a bit. There are opportunities for collaborative builds or speed runs with these sets so although marketed as a relaxing personal experience there is great scope for making it a great social experience when safe to do so.</p>

<p>I will get round to using the smashing&nbsp;new 4 stud brick separator and make the combined &quot;ultimate image&quot; which instructions can be found on the Lego site but for now&nbsp;I am resting my thumbs and enjoying the individual images as the thought of sorting the bricks is daunting. Overall&nbsp;the experience has been tremendously positive and enjoyable and I would recommend the Iron Man Art series to any marvel fans or anyone who wants to just build something totally different from Lego.&nbsp;</p>
