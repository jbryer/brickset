"Bombastus","2020-08-11T13:10:33.42Z","Boring build and disappointing result","<p>I got a 35% discount on release day and decided to buy three sets to build the large Darth Vader. I wasn&#39;t able to find a proper place to hang it though. As mentioned by others, it&#39;s very tall and looks best when looked at from a distance.<br />
<br />
I decided to build two of the smaller versions (Maul and Vader. Discarded Kylo Ren as I don&#39;t like the sequel trilogy).<br />
<br />
I started with Maul, but was disappointed. The resolution is way too low, due to the facial markings. The mosaic only looks good at 2.5+ meters distance, which is rarely possible in my apartment. I disassembled it and started the smaller Vader. I&#39;m nearly done right now and it looks much better. Still a bit too pixelated, but much better.<br />
<br />
I will be returning two of the sets and keep the smaller Vader.<br />
<br />
The building process is the worst I have experienced so far among my current sets (roughly 100 different). It&#39;s very boring and tedious.</p>

<p>The per pieces price is very good, but the large majority of pieces is of course 1x1 studs. You only use 2304 studs (48x48 matrix) and maybe 100 for the frame and therefore will have almost 1000 studs leftover.</p>

<p><br />
Overall I would rate the set 2/5.</p>

"TMYM","2021-07-22T10:50:10.2Z","Beautiful display pieces","<p>These look amazing! All three pictures look great! Darth maul is my favourite, Kylo Ren&#39;s was surprisingly good and darth vader was probably the worst just because it was an artistic representation rather than a photographic one. It still looks great though.</p>

<p>One thing to note is that they don&#39;t look that great up close, and really have to be seen from a distance (the further the better). Hang them in a large room.&nbsp;</p>

"Duskcosmog","2023-04-07T22:38:04.43Z","Beautiful set, but horrible building experience.","<p>This is a LEGO art set that can depict Darth Vader, Darth maul, or Kylo ren (personally I chose kylo because he looked the best, even though out of all the characters he&#39;s the worst) ; you can also create a full body vader if you buy three of this set.&nbsp; After it&#39;s built it beautiful and you can hang it on a wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Just like every Art set there are no minifigs included.</p>

<p>The build is horrendous. The frame is repetitive because you have to build 9 squares. And then the actual art part is repetitive, difficult to keep track of where you are, and it just hurts your hands and finger tips (This is an issue with every Art set not just this one). Defently *DO NOT*&nbsp;buy for the build.</p>

<p>For parts it&#39;s good for larger black plates, technic system beams, technic pins, and tons of ?????????? 1&times;1 studs.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t want those this sets sucks for you in the parts department.</p>

<p>It does contain a new and unique brick separator to make removing the studs easier.</p>

<p>My final thoughts are that it&#39;s beautiful once finished but the build is one if the worst.</p>

<p>I would get it&nbsp; though just because of how beautiful it is once finished.</p>
