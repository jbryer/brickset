"Eep","2021-01-18T15:17:51.207Z","OK but needs more interactivity","<p>Overall the model is fine and the head/ear articulation is great!</p>

<p>However, there are some things this set could have to be better:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Articulatable (rotatable/pivotable) arms</li>
	<li>Better finger articulation: hands rotate and fingers pivot but don&#39;t grasp the Razor Crest shifter knob very well</li>
	<li><em>All</em> fingernails should use pyramids (<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6249125"">6249125</a>)</li>
	<li>Head fuzz/hair (stickers would suffice at least)</li>
	<li>Closeable/squintable eyelids/eyes</li>
	<li>Feet</li>
	<li>Cloth clothing</li>
	<li>Lower price! $80 US is a lot even though it&#39;s a ~1000-piece set (cloth clothing would reduce part count substantially)</li>
</ul>

<p>Update: I have added a ball-and-socket (<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4497253/brick-2x2-w-ball-%C3%B8-10-2"">4497253</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4619760/brick-2x2-w-cup-for-ball"">4619760</a>) to articulate the right arm holding the shift knob but need more sand yellow pieces to properly do the left arm.</p>

"Luckycat","2021-01-25T15:40:46.817Z","Warning: May be painful to hug...","<p>I own most of the big Star Wars Character sets, and The Child is certainly my favourite. The build does take a while, so, if you&#39;re like me, you&#39;re able to spread the build over a number of days. The clothes do get a bit repetitive due to the simple, small parts and the colours almost all being the same. However, the head is fun to build, especially as they build it sideways. In addition, the functioning ears are a great addition but the hands (especially his right one) and his thumbs aren&#39;t as thought out. Turning them/lifting them can easily break them off as there are pieces blocking af full 90 degree lift or&nbsp;turns. The eyes have a great print on them that increases the cuteness, as well as the positions his face, mouth and ears can pull off. The sticker fact file isn&#39;t very informative, however, due to the top two rows both being &ldquo;unknown&rdquo;.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, a great set to have, and again I warn you, don&#39;t try to hug him too hard, the bricks are sharp!</p>

"LegendaryBrix","2022-01-28T01:27:35.74Z","Grogu!!!","<p>This set came out in 2020! But here I am reviewing it in 2022!&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am a&nbsp;big Star Wars fan and&nbsp;I love&nbsp;some of the amazing builds the theme has. Now I got this set purely because i was interested in the design.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t that repetitive but it IS very tedious. There are over 50 of the same pieces, so you know what I am saying here. Overall definitely not better than the Yoda one.</p>

<p>But the price per part is awesome! $80 for over 1000 pcs is always a good deal!</p>

<p>I recommend buying this, but if you do NOT like tedious builds, don&#39;t buy it!</p>

"Pip_Turen","2022-02-16T04:32:29.21Z","Baby Yoda but big","<p>Hello! This is my first review,&nbsp;so apologies if it&#39;s a bit blah, and I plan to post more as I rebuild my collection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I got this set a few weeks ago during a grocery run. I definitely wasn&#39;t expecting the buy, but it&#39;s certainly a welcome one and a wonderful start to my collection.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Packaging &amp; Pricing.</b>&nbsp;The box I got was banged up a bit, but that was on purpose; there were plenty of unmarked options at the location I got it at. The set itself is divided between six bags, while I&#39;ll detail more below. As for the price, the flat 80USD seems fair if not a tiny bit overpriced, but I got it at 60USD, which definitely made me feel better about the purchase.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong>. As stated above, the set has 8&nbsp;bags, each one covering a certain area of the build. Bag 1 covers the frame, which is pretty standard with other character display sets {one that&#39;s notable in my mind is #75230 Porg, which I&#39;ve had in the past and might still have now somewhere in moving boxes. Bags 2-5 cover each of the sides; none of them were the most excited of builds, but they also weren&#39;t dreadfully boring. Bag 6 covers the arms, which were a bit better, and 7-8 both cover&nbsp;the head, which was certainly my favorite part of the build. As a builder with years of experience before my dark ages, it took a few minutes to get back into the swing of things, and overall it took about 4 or 5 hours to finish.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures.&nbsp;</strong>The set only contains one minifig, the Baby Yoda babyfig, and even then it can hardly be counted as a proper minifig. Nevertheless, it&#39;s a welcome addition to the set, especially since most other sets with him in it are over 100USD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Model.</strong>&nbsp;The model itself looks amazing. Although mainly monochromatic between the tan and sand green, which can be a problem for some people, the use of slopes and studs to portray wrinkles in the robe are pulled off well. The arms are connected to the body via a trio of technic pins on either side, and they&#39;re supported extremely well while being easily removable.</p>

<p>The arms and head have full rotatability, the mouth opens, and the eyes are&nbsp;constructed with a brilliant technique to capture their almond shape. The ears can also be tilted up and down to portray different emotions, but some tan is visible from the back of the model; this is easily fixable with repositioning some tiles, but a detriment to be noted nonetheless.</p>

<p>The display plaque&nbsp;is nothing special and my sticker was wrinkled, although I suspect that may be due to my selection of a dented box. The addition of the silver ball that Baby Yoda stole from the Razor Crest, however, is certainly a welcome addition.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>After The Build.</strong>&nbsp;As expected, a model set doesn&#39;t have much in terms of being a stationary display piece, so that&#39;s really it for this section of the review.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Overall.</strong>&nbsp;All-in-all, The Child is a wonderful set and one I&#39;m excited to have in my collection. If you can get it at a discounted price like I have, leap at the chance; even if you can&#39;t, though, it&#39;s not a waste of $80. Worst-case, you use it as a parts pack for the tan&nbsp;plates and sand-green slopes.</p>
