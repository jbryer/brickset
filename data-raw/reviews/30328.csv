<p>Monkie kid is a theme I quite like , but to me the most interesting sets are the biggest ones so this may be the only set from the theme I ever get , so it&#39;s a good job it&#39;s already one of my favourite non licensed polybags .</p>

<p>The Minifigures-</p>

<p>The minifigure has a very nice dual moulded hair headband combo with the overlap of red and black being seamless , his face is dual sided with a scared and determined facial expressions , his torso is his work uniform with the piggsy logo at the back and his legs are dual moulded , printed , side printed and foot printed .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>build is built on the 2020 motorcycle frame piece with a black base and red wheels , the handlebars are light grey and the figure can be held in securely , the back has a 2&times;3 teele coloured plate and has two 1&times;1 white dumplings a 2&times;2 light tan round brick with a 2&times;2 dark tan snot round plate to hold onto the very nicely printed two piece takeout box .</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a great polybag with great parts and a nice figure highly recommend it to any Lego fan , it is a shame it is no longer a gift with purchase like when I got it so good look if you want it .</p>

At this time, he did not yet acquire the powerful staff, that is probably why he looks so worried. This, or maybe he has to hurry up to get the delivery done. His second face on the other hand looks like he moans about yet another delivery Pigsy is asking him to do.</p>

<p>MK is driving a red motorcycle with yellow grills to the side, perfectly in line with his usual color scheme. He also carries a box from Pigsy&#39;s noodle shop with him.</p>

<p>Kids will love to drive the motorcycle, adults will get this set for the minifig and/or as a nice addition to a bunch of Monkie Kid sets like the Panda Store from 80011, the Noddle Shop from 80012, Pigsy&#39;s Food Truck (80009) or his Noodle Tank (80026).</p>
