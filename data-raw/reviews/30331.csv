Alas, for people in Indonesia like me, we only have LEGO Certified Stores and these stores do not stock all type of Blister Packs. So our alternatives are getting it from overseas or getting it from online marketplace at higher price.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am lucky enough to be able to get this set at reasonable cost, so, let us see whether this set is worth enough.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1632356342887-92G1RCUY1DKXUL5Q5RZQ/Mainan+LEGO+Harry+Potter+40419?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we can see, this set is focusing mostly on the minifigures like all Blister Pack sets are. This set mostly focus on Harry Potter minifigures which seems to be in their final year seeing that they are using adult legs instead of the children legs part. The characters are Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy, Cho Chang and Hannah Abbot.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures Discussion</strong></p>

<p>The important things on these minifigures are that they are unique to this set. With the exception to Cho Chang, you might be able to create the other 3 minifigures from buying parts separately. But Cho Chang torso (the Ravenclaw uniform)&nbsp;is only available from this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1632619841136-XQ7EQGLN97FU9RKATLXN/Minifigure+LEGO+Harry+Potter+40419?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>These minifigures have dual face expressions. The first expression can be seen from the photo above where we can see that Harry Potter is smiling,&nbsp;Draco Malfoy with serious expression, Cho Chang with a happy and smiling expression while Hannah Abbott is smirking.</p>

<p>Then the alternate expression of these characters can be viewed on the photo below. We can see that Harry Potter is upset, Draco Malfoy is angry, Cho Chang is worried while Hannah Abbott is shocked.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One important thing I have to point out is that the scar on Harry Potter head is covered by his hair as usual.</p>

<p>Of course with these dual expressions, it can be an added play value for this set.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1632619939462-9N4GSL8034XNP3SNF2FG/Minifigure+LEGO+Harry+Potter?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Accessories Discussion</strong></p>

<p>The accessory on this set are the Marauder Map, Binded Book, Green Apple, Lantern and a brick built bookshelf. One important accessory is the Marauder Map. The Marauder Map is a printed tile and not using a sticker which is cool. And the Marauder Map is available from this set only which make it a valuable addition to this set.</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5f06d2b4df9fa94888ac8286/1632355853380-2EBAHEAV5XMJJ938G9AR/Aksesoris+mainan+LEGO+40419?format=500w"" style=""width: 500px; height: 375px;"" /></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I only wish the LEGO Certified Stores in Indonesia here would stock up all type of Blister Pack sets in the future so we can get easy access for these sets.</p>

<p><strong>Building Experience</strong></p>

<p>I am quite satisfied with this set. And I believe Harry Potter collectors along with minifigure collectors should have this set.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Sufficient parts for this build. I wish for at least more accessories to make it more fun to play with.</p>

<p><strong>Playability</strong></p>

<p>With the dual face expressions, it is more fun playing with this set especially when combined with other Harry Potter sets.</p>

<p><strong>Value For Money</strong></p>

<p>The price is quite ok if we can get it directly from LEGO Brand Store and my rating reflect the price from buying it directly.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Special Note</strong></p>

<p>Please note that I write this review based on my own LEGO Blog article (in Indonesian language) which is available from:&nbsp;<a href=""https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-harry-potter-review-set-40419"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Link to external website, opens in a new tab."">https://indobrickville.com/main/lego-harry-potter-review-set-40419</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this insight from me will be useful for all AFOLs out there!</p>

"DoctorDumbledore","2022-12-27T14:08:42.567Z","A powerful pack!","<p>40419-1 Hogwarts Students Accessory Set is a good little build, the minifigure are interesting, all of them unique to this set, and the build is simple but interesting.</p>

<p>Harry Potter remains the same which honestly a shame, I think they should have made a curious face since he&#39;s tracking Draco. He is equipped with a wand and more interesting the marauders map which is printed on a 2x3 tile, and shows the Draco walking.</p>

<p>Draco Malfoy head and hair remains the same from 75969: Hogwarts Astronomy Tower, but like Harry has a grey jumper with house tie and stripe, which is great for if you want to make your own Hogwarts students. Draco carries a wand and an apple he uses for the Vanishing Cabniet.</p>

<p>Cho Chang represents Ravenclaw in this little set, which is a shame because I think someone else should have represented Ravenclaw like Luna or Terry Boot who has yet to appear as a minifig, she has a nice head which should be lighter but is excusable, she is equipped with a wand and a blank book, I personally think a printed book would have been nice like tales of Beedle the Bard would have been nice.</p>

<p>Hannah Abbott finishes our minifigure collection and is absolutely my favourite at of them, all her head resembles Claire from Jurassic Park but slightly different, she wear her respected house colours, she is equipped with a wand and a lantern both of which I approve.</p>

<p>The small little build finishes the pack, the bookshelf is nicely built with a space for Cho&#39;s book, I think it would be a nice addition to 76403: Hogwarts: Dumbledore&#39;s Office.</p>

<p>Overall this is a nice little set which makes a nice addition to your collection, It is also nice to get some sixth film characters, and the price 14.99 is reasonable.</p>
