That being said, the build in this set is rather limited and could have been better.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Using the newer card designs the packaging for this set uses a tray shaped like a Minifigure instead of a large rectangular tray from past years. They have also re-designed them to be easier to open making these AFOL friendly packaging that doesn&rsquo;t need to be destroyed to get the LEGO products out. The front include artwork of New York with Avengers Tower clearly visible, the four Minifigures and build are on the side with a call-out for the number of Minifigures. Overall a decent enough package design for this type of product.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This particular set has a limited number of parts, so there isn&rsquo;t much to discuss here. We have a stud shooter in this set being used to launch 1x1 cylinders instead. And some plates and other elements for Falcon&rsquo;s wings.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">AIM Agent: Two identical agents are in this set with oxygen masks and guns for accessories. The printing on them are perfect for cannon fodder, with dual-sided torsos with armor and AIM logos on the chest, they have bare legs, no printing details. Overall nice troopers for your villains&rsquo; collection.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Black Widow: Highly detailed with arm printing this version of Black Widow goes back to the long over-the-shoulder hair piece and two &lsquo;batons&rsquo; for accessories. She includes a dual-sided head with determined expression on one and regular smile on the other, her armour is highly detailed. I like the look of this print, really stands out to me as the best Minifigure from this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Falcon: Inspired by a classic comic design re-imagined for a new generation, this version of Falcon is mostly red with dual-molded legs for his white boots, some bare arms, light nougat gloves and two expressions with goggles down and different positions for his mouth, smiling on one and frowning on the other. He has no accessories because of the wings, and no version of Red Wing his sometimes animal partner.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build &amp; The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">As I noted in the parts we have two things to build here, a launcher and wings. There is nothing much to it, pretty quick and easy build and a few elements for play. Since this set is an Accessory Set it is better served as an add-on for the Avengers vs. AIM sets of 2020.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set is mostly for the figures, if you want them you&rsquo;ll buy it. If you aren&rsquo;t interested in them it&rsquo;s safe to skip. So I would recommend this set mostly for Super Heroes collectors or fans of Black Widow and Falcon.</p>
