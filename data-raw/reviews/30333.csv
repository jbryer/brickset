Released in August 2020, these retail for &pound;8.99/$9.99 each and have an average of 12&nbsp;pieces each. The Power Up&nbsp;we will be looking at today is the 71370 Fire Mario Power Up Pack&nbsp;which&nbsp;has 11&nbsp;pieces giving a price per part of 74p/83c.</p>

<p>Before I review this set it&#39;s important to know that the Mario figurine is NOT included in this set.</p>

<p>I reviewed the 71360 Adventures with Mario already, please read that review for more on how the Mario figure works:&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/57216"">https://brickset.com/reviews/57216</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Fire Suit</strong></p>

<p>The main selling point of this set is Mario&#39;s exclusive fire suit. Let&#39;s start with the pants first.</p>

<p>Fire Mario&#39;s pants are almost the exact same as that in the starter course, the difference isn&#39;t because its white but because inside the suit where it connects to Mario the pins are in a different order so Mario recognises which suit his wearing. Apart from that there&#39;s no real change in the suit piece with his Brown shoes at the bottom and two studs to place a 1x1 round tiles in yellow, both which are present in the starter course Mario suit.</p>

<p>Now, Fire Mario&#39;s hat is identical to that in the starter course only just in White and lacks the white boarder around his M that there is in the starter course. This has a 2x2 anti-stud space to fit on Mario&#39;s head.</p>

<p><strong>Interactive Features</strong></p>

<p>When the Mario figurine, from the 71360 Adventures with Mario, is placed into the fire suit he makes a power up sound and a fire plant appears on his belly&#39;s LCD screen. So what can Mario do when in this suit, well when he is tilted back and forward then steps on most characters with interactive tiles Mario gets bonus coins and depending on how many times you tilted him he can defeat bosses within 1 hit.</p>

<p>For example Bowser Jr from the starter course usually takes 6 hits with Mario to take him out but if you tilt Mario in his fire suit 5 or 6 times you can defeat Bowser Jr in just one hit.</p>

<p>From what I know these are the only character where this feature doesn&#39;t work:</p>

<p>- Bob-omb, Peepa, Toad, Toadette, Yoshi and Swoop.</p>

<p>All other characters should be able to use this interactive feature.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Now each of these Power Up packs contain a small build to display the suit on when it&#39;s not in use, this is where most of the pieces actually go to. Each build has two of the 4x4 plates first introduced in the Mario theme, Fire Mario has these in the harder to get red colour.</p>

<p>Connecting each plate is a red 2x4 plate, the right 4x4 plate is empty as that is where Mario&#39;s pants go. The left plate has a little build consisting of a 2x2 light grey brick with a 2x2 dark grey jumper plate to place the Fire Mario&#39;s hat on, next to that is a 1x2 brick brick and finally a small 1x1 trans-orange pyramid piece in front of the hat display.</p>

<p>This display stand can also be used to display the original suit Mario has from the Starter Course when his using the fire suit.</p>

<p><strong>App</strong></p>

<p>The instructions are in paper form unlike most of the other Super Mario sets, but to add this to your virtual collection on the LEGO Super Mario app you just add it in the add set area and place Mario into the suit where it will show you how to fire the fire balls.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Although the function is nice, the price of &pound;8.99/$9.99 is completely ludicrous for how little you get. 12 pieces for this price, most being pretty small is bonkers, these should have been no more than a fiver.</p>

<p>Back to set, it&#39;s nice for anyone doing the Mario theme as intended but for someone just buys the odd one or two sees I do not recommend this set, tbh I think these are just not worth the money and don&#39;t offer too much play value that justifies buying these.</p>

<p>I would only recommend these when these will be reduced, because they will, and I am thankful that I only paid &pound;2 for mine with some Amazon credit.</p>

<p><strong>Pros - </strong>The feature works pretty well, gives Mario a new style</p>

<p><strong>Cons - </strong>Massively overpriced, so little to justify buying</p>

However, when we told my son that he could buy a Lego set for selling some old toys, this was the only one he wanted. He just wanted the pants so Mario could shoot fireballs. He already discovered that by holding down different combinations of buttons around Mario&#39;s privates that he can gain different powers and realized that the pants were key to doing this. Of course you can&#39;t play with Mario if you are busy holding buttons, so these pants are the only way to do it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for functionality, it works exactly as described. We only have the starter set so far so we can only use this on Baby Bowser, but my son doesn&#39;t mind. He has the pants, it shoots fireballs, he&#39;s happy. To me it seems silly and foolish, but not to a 7 year old, and you can&#39;t forget that these are toys for kids.</p>

<p>In fact my son&nbsp;could care less about the hat, it doesn&#39;t do anything, he doesn&#39;t even understand that it completes the outfit (but that&#39;s my fault for being a responsible parent and not giving him access to video games).&nbsp;My son was&nbsp;well aware the build is pointless, he didn&#39;t even build it into his course yet, it sits outside of his game.</p>

<p>So this was really just $10 for a pair of pants, outrageous! But did it make him happy? It sure did, he loves these pants so much that $10 seems like an absolute bargain. It&#39;s made him just as happy as some of the $100 sets that I own.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying you should go out and buy this set, you shouldn&#39;t, but kids do love it. So if your kid is begging for these pants, think of it this way, they are asking for a $10 Lego set and not a $50 or $100 one. You can&#39;t put a price on happiness so just be glad it&#39;s only $10. I&#39;m just glad that these are the only pants he wants. I can say without a doubt that this is the best $10 I&#39;ve spent on Legos for my son. Most $10 sets to him are just spare parts.&nbsp;</p>
