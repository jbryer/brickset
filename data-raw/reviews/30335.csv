<p>When you open this set&nbsp;you will find one bag of parts and the legs come separately. The instruction manual is like a poly-bags it is folded several times. Unlike the other Super Mario sets the instructions are printed. I prefer this way.</p>

<p>Build</p>

<p>The build is very simple and with only 11 pieces it is very quick.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability</p>

<p>Just like all the other Super Mario sets it is a very fun set. Of course, you will need the starter course to play with this set. As soon as you put the legs on mario he will make the power up noise and on its chest it will show a bell. This suit will allow you&nbsp;to make mario climb&nbsp;up walls and earn coins.</p>

<p>Value</p>

<p>As like all the power up packs the price per piece is rubbish. I cannot justify paying&nbsp;&pound;8.99 / $9.99 / &euro;9.74 for this set. I advise you to do what I did and wait for a sale.</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>It is not a great set for a lot of reasons. I don&#39;t think you should buy this set unless you are a big fan of the Super Mario theme and you want to collect all the sets. Or if you can get a deal.</p>

"Minifig290","2020-12-24T00:20:35.147Z","Too expensive for what it is","<p>Hello, today I&#39;ll be taking a look at one of the 4 LEGO Super Mario Power Up Packs. Released in August 2020, these retail for &pound;8.99/$9.99 each and have an average of 12 pieces each. The Power Up we will be looking at today is the 71372&nbsp;Cat&nbsp;Mario Power Up Pack which has 11 pieces giving a price per part of 74p/83c.</p>

<p>Before I review this set it&#39;s important to know that the Mario figurine is NOT included in this set.</p>

<p>I reviewed the 71360 Adventures with Mario already, please read that review for more on how the Mario figure works:&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/57216"">https://brickset.com/reviews/57216</a>&nbsp;.</p>

<p><strong>Cat Suit</strong></p>

<p>The main selling point of this set is Mario&#39;s exclusive cat&nbsp;suit. Let&#39;s start with the pants first.</p>

<p>Cat Mario&#39;s pants are in the yellow colour with a large print on the front for his belly in white and on the back is a print for a small cat tail, this trial print is outlined in orange with the tip of the tail represented in a white print. The shoes on the suit are white instead of the Brown in the starter course. On the pants are two studs to place a 1x1 round tile in yellow.</p>

<p>Now, Cat&nbsp;Mario&#39;s hat is an exclusive mould to this set, the hat piece is shaped like a cap in a yellow colour with some dark&nbsp;orange printed on the front lip. On the hat are some daul-moulded ears with some pink print in the middle of each ear.</p>

<p><strong>Interactive Features</strong></p>

<p>When Mario, from the 71360 Adventures with Mario, is placed into the suit he makes a power up sound and a golden bell appears on his belly&#39;s&nbsp;LCD screen.&nbsp;When Mario is in his suit he can collect coins when he climbs up things, whiles he does this he makes a variety of sounds.</p>

<p>From what I&#39;ve experienced it is 2 coins every three steps in a climb, but this may vary.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>Now each of these Power Up packs contain a small build to display the suit on when it&#39;s not in use, this is where most of the pieces actually go to. Each build has two of the 4x4 plates first introduced in the Mario theme, Cat&nbsp;Mario has these in the very common&nbsp;light green colour.</p>

<p>Connecting each plate is a light green&nbsp;2x4 plate, the right 4x4 plate is empty as that is where Mario&#39;s pants go. The left plate has a small four piece assembly with a 2x2 brown brick topped with a 2x2 green jumper tile to place Cat Mario&#39;s hat on when out of use. Beside this piece is a small flower using a green leaf piece and a dark yellow flower piece, this small build can be placed anywhere in the small build.</p>

<p>This display stand can also be used to display the original suit Mario has from the Starter Course when his using the cat suit.</p>

<p><strong>App</strong></p>

<p>The instructions are in paper form unlike most of the other Super Mario sets, but to add this to your virtual collection on the LEGO Super Mario app you just add it in the add set area and place Mario into the suit where it will show you how to use the feature of this suit.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is one of the weaker sets in the Mario theme, the feature although decent isn&#39;t that amazing compared to the Fire Mario suit where he can throw fireballs at his enemies and gain more coins, this feature on the Cat Mario isn&#39;t as entertaining as that and just feels like a way to lazily gain more coins.</p>

<p>What makes this set more unappealing though is its price, $10/&pound;9 for a mere 11 pieces is just not worth it, I understand the Mario hat and suit are big pieces but to me they do not do much to justify the cost of this set. This set should have been no more than a fiver at most.</p>

<p>I would recommend this set only if its on a discounted price, luckily for me Argos had this at half price, but tbh even at &pound;4.50 I&#39;m still struggling to see value for this suit in particular.</p>

<p><strong>Pros -&nbsp;</strong>The feature works decently, gives Mario a new style</p>

<p><strong>Cons -&nbsp;</strong>Massively overpriced, so little to justify buying</p>

<p>I have also reviewed the Fire Mario Suit -&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/57657"">Best of the Power Up Packs, but the price is shocking | Brickset: LEGO set guide and database</a></p>
