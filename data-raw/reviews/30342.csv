If you&#39;ve built one of his computers you&#39;ll notice some common themes despite being a different style. McVeigh uses layering and negative space to really carve out some angles and shapes you generally don&#39;t see in a Lego kit. This Batman is slickly designed, a fun 30 or so minute build, and looks great with a really nice built-in stand. It&#39;s a tight-carefully crafted kit that will look great on any Bat-fan&#39;s mantle. I hope Lego continues with more affordably priced display pieces, I think these will have a lot of appeal to AFOLS who might not be able to afford the higher end Architecture or Creator sets but still want something a bit &quot;classy&quot; to look at.</p>
