<p><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">&ldquo;Sir, a giant boulder has fallen on top of the Hulkbuster suit and flattened the head into the approximate size and shape of a very large pancake!&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">&quot;Curses! Well... give it a couple exclusive prints and then we can still charge an extra ten dollars for it!&quot;</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">&ldquo;But it is getting too expensive&hellip;&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">&ldquo;Ok, sir, how about this&hellip; we change the Silver Centurion figure with full arm printing and side leg printing to the same Iron Man suit in everything else, add two generic aim agents, and still charge the same!&rdquo;</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">&ldquo;Sounds great! No one really wanted a Silver Centurion anyway!&quot;*</span></span></p>

<h3 style=""margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Box</span></span></h3>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">It is just a regular box, to open it, you cut the tape on the side, and pour out three separate bags. The box art depicts the Hulkbuster taking on some AIM agents. Not much else to say here.</span></span></p>

<h3 style=""margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Build</span></span></h3>

<p style=""margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Upon opening bag one, I was delighted to see it contained Rescue, the figure I was most looking forward to in this set. Bag one has you build the complete body of the Hulkbuster and Rescue&#39;s little laser chair thing. Bag the second contains both A.I.M. agents, and has you build the legs. I was very pleasantly surprised by the knee construction, seems like something a top-tier moc maker would create. The final bag completes the build and figure selection, with Iron Man.</span></span></p>

<h3 style=""margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Minifigures</span></span></h3>

<p style=""margin-top:15px; margin-bottom:15px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Our first minifigure is Rescue a.k.a. Pepper Potts/Stark, or, as my 4-year-old brother calls her, Salt. It is a simply great figure that utilizes the newer helmet piece, with lighter red and silver color scheme. Her suit is more complex, yet simpler than her hubbies&#39; (are they married in this set? I guess since there isn&#39;t any single piece of source material, It is up to you, or in this case, me). Her head printing appears in numerous other sets, in only one of those other ones is her. https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6192171. The two A.I.M. agents are very cool, particularly the flying one with flick-fire missiles. The final figure is Iron Man, who uses the newer helmet as well, personally I prefer this newer piece, but anyways, this Iron Man fig is the exact same as in all the other recent Marvel sets, and still looks pretty nice.</span></span></p>

<h3 style=""margin-top:19px; margin-bottom:5px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Complete Model</span></span></h3>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The final model has a nice combination of light and dark red, with gold accents. It stands taller and sits wider than all previous Hulk (and War Machine) busters except for obviously the &quot;UCS&quot; one. There is room for Iron Man to sit in the body of the set, you lift the rather flat looking head, and place him in. There is a small control panel piece that uses a sticker inside; it looks nice. Rescue and her laser shooter can sit on either shoulder of the set, with weak connection. The back of the set is rather detailed and has clips for the two power bursts included in bag one. The ankles have minimum articulation, while there is none on the knees. The waist can spin 360 degrees, and is fun to position as if it is winding up for a punch or a kick. The arm joints are what you would expect, decent articulation on the shoulders and elbows. The shoulder armor was really enjoyable to build, and looks great.</span></span></p>

<h3 style=""margin-top:19px; margin-bottom:5px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Verdict</span></span></h3>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">This set is a great Hulkbuster out of all the play scale ones, flat head and all. Personally, I like the flat head. The minifigures are good, one is great, and they all work in the set. The shoulder laser mount may be a bit useless (my younger brother loves it though) but that is minor, and you can always take it off. In the end, I would recommend this set to anyone without a Hulkbuster, or with. It is just an all-around good set!</span></span></p>
