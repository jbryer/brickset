Having missed out on the first one it was a necessity that I wouldn&rsquo;t miss out on this one. Being a strict MCU fan I questioned how this set would even fit into my collection, being that the Tower no longer belongs to The Avengers,&nbsp;but I was happily pleased with everything in this set. From the exterior to the interior this set is packed with detail. So without much more fanfare, let&rsquo;s dive in to my breakdown/ review.</p>

<p>Minifigures: This set comes with seven Minifigures, and for the most part in my opinion they are all great. I&rsquo;ll start with the two AIM agents. I understand the common complaint that we get too many AIM agents, and I agree&hellip; To an extent. In the comics the AIM agents were always a very go to henchmen type force, given that, I don&rsquo;t mind that we are getting so many, but I wish got more unique variants for them. Also, the inclusion of two AIM agents feels like a bit much. I would have much rather got another Avenger such as Captain America, Hawkeye, or even another Captain Marvel, given that she only appeared in the horrible 4+ set, and the overpriced too small Helicarrier. Of course that is only my opinion, but moving on to look at the actual figure. It has the gun metal grey helmet piece on the yellow head piece that Lego has been using this year. I actually like the head piece better without the gun metal grey breather piece that was also included on them. I feel like it makes them look more like the actual AIM agents from the comics. Lastly, the agents come with a great gun build with a lot of great details.&nbsp;Looking next at Red Skull, I was really surprised we got this figure with set, considering the fact that Lego could&rsquo;ve just used the jail cell for one of the AIM agent, but I&rsquo;m very happy they didn&rsquo;t. I believe that the face print here is new, although I don&rsquo;t own the most recent Red Skull, only the original one from the older set. The torso print is also very nice and looks a lot like the MCU version of the character. I wish he&rsquo;d got printed legs, but instead he only has plain legs here. The Red Skull figure also comes with a unique gun build that looks like a mix between the AIM agents gun and a grenade launcher, but nonetheless it&rsquo;s a very neat build. Looking now at the first of the two new Iron Man armors, Blazer. The story behind these town new armors is kind of interesting. You see, Blazer is based off of the Hot Rod suit from the MCU, and Taser is based off of Blue Steel, but because of licensing issues Lego renamed them for this set. Back to the figure, I love everything about this minifigure, the coloring from the helmet, to the torso, to the leg printing is just exceptional. He comes with flame pieces to complete the &ldquo;Blazer&rdquo; persona. Taser is good, but in my opinion he is overshadowed by all the effort put into the Blazer figure. Nonetheless, the blue and silver color scheme works pretty well, and he comes with lightning pieces to represent his &ldquo;Tasing&rdquo; powers.&nbsp;Next, the actual Iron Man figure. This Iron Man figure is an interpretation of the one from the upcoming video game, and as far as accuracy to the game is concerned it is a great figure. But, so far this summer he&rsquo;s been in almost every set.&nbsp;It&rsquo;s getting pretty tiring for those who get all the wave and end up with five Iron Men. Besides it being a common figure I really love it. It comes with the newer helmet piece which doesn&rsquo;t have the face mask lift. The figure comes with two power blast pieces and a rocket booster attachment&nbsp;for his legs. Last but not least, Black Widow. The Black Widow figure is extremely detailed with even a nice arm printing, which is rarely seen on a marvel minifigure. She comes in the Helicarrier set and the Falcon pack, but it makes up for being common with it&rsquo;s detailed torso, arms and legs. Now that we&rsquo;ve examined the minifigures let&rsquo;s look at the build.</p>

<p><b>Build: </b>The main build here is the Tower, but a hover bike is also included so let&rsquo;s look at that first. The hover bike is nice, but I do have a few complaints about it. First, the build can be very fragile and a slightly uneasy movement could completely tear the bike apart. Second, the minifigure has no good way of staying in it. The back headrest thing is supposed to sit on their back to keep them in, but it&rsquo;s rarely ever functional. Lastly on the bike, it takes up a lot of the tower. It sits on the ground floor where you&rsquo;d think the entrance to the tower would be, but instead is where the hover bike is. I believe at the price of the set, and if this bike was truly necessary that they could leave the floor like this, but should add another bottom floor including a receptionist desk or something like that. Moving on to look at the tower, the bottom floor has a parking station for the hover bike and on the other side features an Arc Reactor that looks very similar to the one seen in Iron Man 1. Also included is a hologram demonstrating how the Arc Reactor powers the entire tower. I love the Arc Reactor Easter egg but there are still lots more to come. The second floor includes a housing station for Blazer and Taser, this area almost feels like it&rsquo;s paying tribute to the Iron Legion floor from the older tower set. Across from the miniature hall of armor is an awesome weapon rack set. The weapons rack includes Black Widow&rsquo;s guns, Hawkeyes bow and arrow, a flashlight, a pair of binoculars, and a spot for Iron Man&rsquo;s helmet. Behind the rack is the Infinity Gauntlet which is something I was fairly surprised appeared in the set. It comes with both the Mind Stone and the Power Stone. We&rsquo;ll see the Power Stone later in the set. Moving up another floor we have the jail cell for Red Skull. I appreciate the bulky design of the cell emphasizing its&nbsp;creative details. Across from the cell is an Easter egg dating back to the first Guardians of the Galaxy film. The build is the same in which the collector used to open the Orb to reveal the Power Stone. I deeply appreciate this detail, and the design for it is nothing short of brilliant. Moving on to the balcony floor we have a living quarters for The Avengers which includes two great looking chairs and a computer table. Across from this area is a TV screen with two possible options. Option 1 is a screen in which The Avengers can be playing a video game in which Captain America is fighting Red Skull, and the second option is a news station where the reporter is talking about the AIM organization. Outside the tower is the balcony build which is highly detailed with a low fence around it. A play feature allows you to drop the balcony also dropping any minifigure on top of it. The top floor is completely empty which is really disappointing, but for those who enjoy adding their own spin to these sets could add in a cool eatery or something. Looking now at the exterior of the Tower, I deeply appreciate the curved architecture around the glass like window pieces. The bottom floor opens down to release the hover bike and the Armory window opens up to allow those suits to fly out. The jail floors window can also break open for AIM soldiers to rescue Red Skull out. Together with the Bike, the interior and the exterior, and the cool play features.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion: </b>I really think this set is great, even at its low spots it still makes up for it with incredible detail and design. With all the newer pieces and great Minifigures there are just layers of extreme effort on Legos part. So, I&rsquo;d completely recommend this set, I&rsquo;m really happy this wave included an Avengers Tower. In my opinion this is the absolute best set of the wave, no question to it, but that&rsquo;s only my opinion. So there&rsquo;s my review!</p>
