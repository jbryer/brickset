"A_Brickset_user","2004-03-20T19:17:34Z","a good addition to any castle collection","The Wolfpack Tower's classic look makes it a must for any Castle collector.  The two red roof panels seem a little pointless, as they cover such a small area.  The hinged rock boulders swing out to reveal a treasure chest full of yellow &quot;gold&quot; bricks, and a rather plain room devoid of decoration.  That room is not enclosed by a roof.  The two towers that the set possesses look very good, however only the tower at the back of the castle is functional.  (it houses the ghost;the tower at the front of the set has no space for a minifig)  Though I like the set overall, the fact that it only contains one Wolfpack shield is very disappointing.

"A_Brickset_user","2004-02-23T15:20:11Z","The Shadow Knows...","Having owned this set for many years, I have concluded that it is a wonderful set for its size and cost.  I like the idea of a castle on the water and two tower design was well conceived.  A must for all serious lego collectors, and I agree with lord penguin: why did lego ever let this series go to the wayside?!  It had great potential!!  And remember... Crime does not pay!!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-30T12:46:13Z","Wolfpack Tower","I think the wolfpack tower is a very good set for several reasons.
1.It has much play value and many surprises.
2.It has many rare pieces and many children in this year love sets like this.
3.It has a classic look about it and is very attractive.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-12-28T14:06:32Z","Very good set","  This is a very good set.  It is an interesting idea, a castle built over water, and it is very convincing.  The towers are very nice but only the 2nd tower is functional as the first simply houses the gate.  The underground dungeon is very nice and it has many drawbriges.  I imagine the wolfpack live here but it has no roof.  However, lots of playability, especially if you already have some Black Knights, its sad this was the biggest the wolfpack got.

"zek","2008-03-27T01:20:57.857Z","Wolfpack Base","This was one of my first castle sets, a not bad set includes four minifigs but the set could of included more. The ghost minifig is super and glows in the dark, Lego should still use them. The hideout itself is not very big and there's not much room in the base. Its cool in the fact its meant to be over water, the walls on the side open up and the hiding place for the treasure chest. Lego should of put something more special in the treasure chest.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-03-30T11:28:54.16Z","Secrets galore!","This set boast some really great design accomplished by the masterful use of hinges that increases the play value of the set.  Firstly the idea of a secret island on a lake connected by a bridge with a drawbridge that can be raised is just too cool to even comprehend and that's just the beginning of things.  The burps on the sides can swing open and hinged &quot;ladders&quot; can swing to form ladders, bridges or even doors to the various chambers in the tower.  There's a water prison that's revealed when the burps are swung and an area to place the treasure chest.

The set comes with a ghost for all the spooky fun, a grey falcon and some really good painted wall corner bricks.  The obvious bad thing are the burps, although they are redeemed somewhat by the fact that they are lighter and thus more easily swingable than if they were constructed out of real bricks.  And the icing on the cake is probably the printed wolfpack flag at the top of the tower.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Rubberducky","2008-04-22T16:46:32.297Z","A golden oldie","i recently rebuilt this set from the origonal instructions. It took me several hours and was very very painstaking. You would just not believe how many 1x1 gray bricks i had to find to make it. I had this set in my old house and it belonged to my older brother, when we moved it was never rebuilt. But now, 11 years on it had. And what a set. i like the capes on the people. the weapons, the ghost. the secrets the base holds and the overall feel of the model. Long live wolfpack!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-17T21:27:41.467Z","A Castle Classic","This is a really over the top set and is a must have for castle fans alike. I like the idea of alternative models, but you need to get multiple sets to make all the models. The ghost minifig is really cool and ultra rare in the Lego market. This is a classic and should be rereleased.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"cbowers","2011-02-04T11:07:53.91Z","The mysterious wolfpack","<p>Although the Wolfpack is often dubious and avoids those knights and royal guards of the Lions, they find their place into the castle realm with this nice hideout. I especially like the fact that it's built over water. This set was a great addition to the castle theme as it helped create another clan to add into the mix. It was no longer big castle against just poor old forestmen. Now you can finally have another rival gang. They can also gang up with forestmen and attack the convoy's of the royal army.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set has a decent piece selection. I like the wolf shields probably the most. There is not much room in the tower, but it still holds its mysterious purpose and you can hide your Wolfpack heroes inside. The slant pieces are the only large ones and are included in most castle sets anyway.&nbsp; I like this set in that it's not some square castle. Lots of playbility and endless in imagination for all your castle needs. </p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"Huge_Nerd","2010-07-23T06:55:15.86Z","a must have for any realm!","The wolfpack tower was a great complement to the other castles in my realm. It was unique in that it was on the water so it gave the boats some more play value. It also has a lot of little features like opening walls, a jail, opening bridges, and hidden treasure. Plus you can't beat a ghost and wolfpack minifigs!<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"AETerry","2011-01-16T10:56:00.15Z","Wolfpack Tower Review","<p>The Wolfpack while a small sub-theme of Castle, were a very good series of sets. The wolfpack lent a sense of banditry and lawlessness that rivaled the Forestmen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Tower set is a must for the wolfpack to provide them a base of operations. And it holds many features such as a jail, sides that open and draw bridge for hours ofplay. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four minifigures are included, 3 Wolfpack and&nbsp;1 Ghost. They've got a treasure chest of loot. Also included are a wolfpack flag and a variety of weapons to arm the bandits.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only disappointment with the Wolfpack in the long run has been there were so few sets to collect and get.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"iamcjb","2011-01-16T13:54:54.593Z","Style Over Function","<p>This was my first ""Castle"" base which I got for my birthday many moons ago. I picked it because it had the new Wolfpack faction who were similar to the Forestmen who were my favourite faction at the time.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The instructions were clear as always, as long as you looked thoroughly before heading to the enxt step due to the many small parts. I found I had to do a good bit of demolishing to fit the set back in the box.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There are a lot of small parts in this box as well as several castle tower sections. I found this set to be perfect for modifying existing sets, especially Forestmen sets. However, while it had plenty of tower pieces, the lack of castle walls and floor pieces (apart from the bridge) was disappointing.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>A glow in the dark ghost and 3 Wolfpack with a range of weapons. A good enough return for a set of this size, and a good start for a Wolfpack army.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>The many small parts meant that despite the size, this set took me a long time to build when I first got it. Even now it takes a good amount of time to build it.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>As mentioned in the title I would say this set chooses style over function. The completed tower looks great, and would remind me of a tower built into a mountain or cliff. The entrance is menacing, requiring entrants to cross a bridge over the water and under the dark tower, with its two lanterns adding to the dark effect. Beyond this is when I find problems. The sides of the tower can be opened to see inside. However this reveals to us the first problem.The base of the set is water, but there is no floor inside the tower, meaning either the Wolfpack have to swim around their own base or the water is shallow thus making the bridge seemingly pointless. There also seems to be a lack of defensive points. The bridge is narrow without any guard points, so if somebody is posted on the bridge they leave no room for entrants. At the top of the front and back towers is a red roof, but this takes up space you could place some archers. The side walls, despite having cool battlements, seem to have a lack of space also. Therefore, unless you modify your set, the Wolfpack have to spend their days playing in the water.</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><div>While the set looks cool, it could do with more space for the 3 nice Wolfpack soldiers and the ghost provided. The water base means boats suddenly have a purpose in ""Castle"" and adds to the look of the tower, but does make up for the lack of some vantage points for the defenders. Some bonuses that I do like about this set, are the amount of small grey and black pieces which I found useful for improving existing sets, the 3 Wolfpack models meaning that this is the perfect set to start an army, and the cheap price. I believe it was bought for £20 which is a bargain, and cheaper than some existing sets. While I wouldn't advise people to go out of their way to get this due to there being better, similar sets, I think it's a decent buy, and a good secondary castle which could be used for enemies of your main force.</div>",TRUE,3,3,4,3,4
"SirSven7","2012-01-10T09:15:10.407Z","Lego Steve's review","<span style=""font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt;"">This
is the only structure ever released for the Wolfpack and it’s rather a small
dingy thing. Built on water baseplate the sets introduces itself with a long
walk across a bridge up to a rather foreboding front entrance, from there you
are lead to a bottom floor covered in water (however that’s a good enough place
to leave their treasure), and from this murky basement a ladder leads up to a
haunted tower with nothing inside it but a ghost, no wonder the Wolfpack only
stuck around for such a short time.&nbsp;</span><br>
<br>
<span style=""font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt;"">Despite
this rather poor introduction, the set is really nice; it has a haunted castle
vibe to it and is very different from anything that had come previously the red
slanted roofs contrast well with the black walls and the blue water and grey bridge
complete the ensemble perfectly; and it should be said that the design on the front
is a thing of beauty.<br><br></span><span style=""font-family: &quot;Calibri&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;; font-size: 11pt;"">It
should be noted that the Wolfpack in this tower are really in need of their
wagon riding brothers as they are actually less well equipped than them (which
is surprising for such a difference in set sizes). This set was also the very
first LEGO set to include BURPs (talk about progress).</span><br><br><!--[if gte mso 9]><xml>

"T79","2018-08-27T14:03:49.013Z","Lego for Toccata and Fugue in D Minor","<p>As the go-to music to introduce a haunted castle in film, J.S. Bach&#39;s organ piece should fit equally well with this ominous Wolfpack Tower, just imagine the thunderous night to go with it yourself :-)</p>

<p>After #6077 Forestmen&#39;s River Fortress this was our second castle with explicit water defences. They share several design queues (for good or ill) and seem to be done by the same designer, in fact looking back at my review of #6077 I just noticed I gave the exact same score on both sets. It probably belonged to my youngest brother as I hardly remember playing with this, likely around this time I was entering the Dark Age.</p>

<p>There are four minifigures, three wolfpack members and another ghost. By now the novelty of the ghost wore a bit thin but I don&#39;t think I ever felt sad for getting another one. ;-) The wolfpack members used the existing pirate heads, suggesting that those pirates are decendants of these wolfpack members? For what amounted to a band of brigands they do show a remarkably cohesive attire, but that&#39;s another thing I never minded. Just like in #6077 some more equipment would have been welcome but it&#39;s acceptable as-is.</p>

<p>Parts wise, it&#39;s your typical castle set but this one was special in that it introduced us to what are now known as LURP and BURP, infinitely less flexible than the same rock built out of bricks but a lot faster (and cheaper, let&#39;s not forget that) to get to cover a reasonable area or to reach a reasonable height. Other pieces that stand out are the corner panel with printed stones and the Wolfpack shield and flag, but the pieces that most caught my attention back then were the four black Slope 53&deg; 3 x 1 x 3 1/3 with Studs on Slope. Probably because they were so unlike anything I had seen before, though later on we also got some of them in yellow from #6277 Imperial Trading Post. Besides these there&#39;s nothing truly special, although you get a good amount of arches and corner panels there are no regular wall panels and the big pieces come at a cost of more regular bricks, which shows in the openness of most of the alternatives.</p>

<p>The resulting tower certainly has the look, the black towers with red roof look striking and the gray bridge and accents stop it from looking too dark. Again just like in #6077 there are several gaps left open that could have been covered up but most don&#39;t matter that much, although if you look at the set from behind there&#39;s a rather unsightly gap on both sides of the gatehouse tower. From the front though, that tower looks menacingly good; the lovely bridge leading up to that dark, gaping mouth with the arrow slits above (just like in - wait for it - #6077), and the torches next to it, the red roof... but the gate itself is just a ladder with clips and a bit of a letdown, really.</p>

<p>And again, just like in #6077, my biggest gripe is with the (lack of) interior: the side walls can open up so you can reach inside but there&#39;s really no reason to do so: inside is only water with a small walkway between the gate and the rear tower and a treasure chest underneath. Just two 4 x 8 plates could have made a floor for things to happen on, add a few bricks and plates for a table and chair as in #6077 Guarded Inn and 10-year-old me would have been happy. The gatehouse is also nothing more than just a ledge on top for a guard, if you were hoping to get an archer behind those arrow slits you&#39;ll be disappointed.</p>

<p>Having just rebuilt this with my children it certainly has the look going for it, upon completion it received a well-deserved &quot;wow!&quot; As great as it looks, I can&#39;t help but see a missed chance here. Nothing a bit of modding can&#39;t fix but it would not have needed that much extra to make this one of the truly great sets of Lego Castle: a different take with great looks but unfortunately lacking an interior play area.</p>

<p>EDIT: on a side note, there&#39;s an awful lot of news linked to this old set but turns out that&#39;s all for <strong>7</strong>6075 Wonder Woman Warrior Battle :-)</p>
