Somewhere in my parents old photo albums there&#39;s a picture of me at about 5 or 6&nbsp;years old right after I put it together. I played with this set for years and years, so many times that I could put it together without instructions and my eyes closed.&nbsp;I still have it too, mixed in with 30,000+ other Legos. And I think I still have most of the instructions too. Great set!</p>
