<br />
Very good value for money compared to many other magazine polybags given it doesn&#39;t contain a minifig. Out of those 44 pieces, 7&nbsp;of them are dark red 1x2 plates. You also get a couple of very useful 1x3 jumper plates, 1x1 brackets, the special studs-with-bar&nbsp;used for the guns, and I&#39;ve never seen the parts used for the fins in white before:&nbsp;they&#39;re the same as the 3x4 stands used in the minifig series. Some useful little slopes too. My only wish is that the studs used on the engines were hollow.<br />
<br />
As far as playability goes, the model itself doesn&#39;t do much. The guns can tilt. But what more should&nbsp;you expect from a tiny A-Wing? Landing gear (or some single piece to look like landing gear) might have been nice but I would honestly rather keep the&nbsp;red tiles.<br />
<br />
Overall a very cute little A-Wing, but much more valuable if you like making custom MOCs!</p>
