	This was the&nbsp;only Castle Lego set I owned as a child. I have to say it was one of my all time favourite lego sets that I had. I spent countless hours playing with these guys. I would build my own castles with my general Lego set blocks I had. I always wanted the the big castle set but it was way too expensive, so, these guys were it.</p>
<p>
	Recently, I opened up my old Lego box that I&#39;d kept all these years. I found after 30 years, I still had the majority of the pieces that came with this set. Fun stuff.</p>
<h4>
	Pros</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		It was inexpensive</li>
	<li>
		It had six minifigs and lots of cool things for them such as the swords, shields, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h4>
	Cons</h4>
<ul>
	<li>
		One couldn&#39;t really build much with it. One really needed some supporting Lego to go with it.</li>
	<li>
		None</li>
</ul>
<p>
	This set was great for a child to play with Lego castle for only a few dollars. It was a great deal for the money. Something a child could buy with his own pocket money.</p>
