"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-17T21:59:39Z","more to it than you think","Although it looks bland in the pic, it is actually very interesting.  First of all, it includes two compartments underneath the sloping parts of the bridge. Under one is a prison with a terminally incarcerated occupant.  The other contains a treasure chest.  The raft's attempt at camouflage is eye-catching, but prevents the raft from crossing under the bridge.  3 guards is an adequate force for protecting the bridge, and I praise TLC for adding a Dragon Knight to dump into the water.  Oddly, the knight on horseback's shield contains a blue dragon, rather than the green, the latter being the color of the Dragon Knights.  This set is a good addition to any collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-29T19:19:59Z","Nice Set!"," I used to have this set, until my sister crushed it. At that point, the pieces scattered, never to be built again. I recently got this set MISB for a great price. This was a lot of fun back then, and it still is. The overall structure is fantastic...and the size is pretty decent, too. I always loved the skeletons, and this set has one. This set is equipped with a dungeon for our deceased friend on one side and an enclosed area located on the opposite side of the bridge. Within this area is a treasure chest. Besides that, a collapsing portion of the bridge, and two towers to keep watch from. Included are 4 minifigs. 3 Royal Knights: 1 guard, 2 archers (one on a camouflaged raft). We also see a Dragon Master with (oddly enough) a Black Knight's shield. There are two minor things that brought my grade down. First off, you receive 3 Royal Knights and 1 Dragon Master. I hate how it is 3 against 1. And finally, the collapsable bridge is held up by a single plant, and isn't all that sturdy. This set brings back great memories. If you find it for less than or a little more than the original retail, buy it! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"legotrainfan","2007-10-26T06:09:35.547Z","Huge bricks","Several huge bricks were used to create this castle. I think smaller ones would have been better. But it's still a great castle with four minifigs and a skeleton. The actual drawbridge is the front part of the castle. Under it there is a prison into which you can put the skeleton. So when enemies arrive, just lift the drawbridge upwards and they will run away in terror when they have seen the skeleton. ;-) You also get a treasure chest and two big gray axes. The raft is also nice. The soldier on it can hide behind a big plant leave, which functions as camouflage. I think there is also a drawbridge just directly behind the gate. I am not 100% sure of that part can also be fully lifted upwards. I disassembled this set and put it back in its box some years ago. I haven't played with it for a long time. 

The trapdoor mechanim of the central part of this set is a great feature, but the big black plate is kept in place by a small plant leave. I think that's not enough. A better mechanism to keep the plate in its place could have been invented. And what I really find strange is that the knight on the horse has a shield that normally only Black Knights have. But the knight in this set is one from the Dragon Knights. The parts of the shield that are blue should be green. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-05-09T08:07:56.51Z","Bridge over troubled waters","A bridge, a tower, a raft and a skeleton.  The raft is nicely done... except for the part with the huge big leaf attached to it.  Is it camoflage, is it a shield, or is it something else?  The tower may look nice at a quick glance, but a more detailed examination will show that it's mostly made up of huge big bricks thrown together pretty much the way a child will stack blocks.  There's no finesse in it.  As for the bridge itself it's rather plain - the only feature is the tilting section which is unimaginative and may not even work properly at times.  This isn't one of the best set for Castle.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"blackhand787","2010-12-01T20:26:05.817Z","Great set if you like castle!","This is a great set. Building it is just okay because TLG has used this design several times before. The raft is new though and is awesome. <br><p>The parts are pretty good because of the weapons mini figs and accessories also the pieces can be used to make a castle if you like which is another reason to buy this set if you don't put the sets together.</p><p>This set has a good playability because of the the five mini figs and the bridge which flips over. The raft is fun to play with also.</p><p>A great value because there are a lot of mini figs and the quantity of the weapons and accessories.</p><p>Overall this set is a great set to buy if you like castle like me.<br></p>",TRUE,4,4,3,5,5

	<span style="""">I see that more crusader figs have been &lsquo;borrowed&rsquo; for this set, and it&rsquo;s a little odd to see a Dragon Master considering the last sets to include that fig had released a year earlier (so effectively that theme had been discontinued).<span style="""">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<span style="""">As for the set itself I see something of a mixed bag, the design looks very nice but it&rsquo;s made from too many large parts so it feels slightly juniorised, the trap is clever but the mechanism to hold it in place is not very sturdy so you have a problem of the bridge spinning when you don&rsquo;t want it too and I like the inclusion of the raft but I just fail to see why it&rsquo;s needed. I also miss the inclusion of some higher ranking Royal Knight, the guards look a bit feeble compared to the Dragon knight and as such I see an uneven battle ahead, we also fail to receive a quiver for the crossbow (ARRRRRR).</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<span style="""">I like the set and it&rsquo;s nice to get a proper bridge to span all those imaginary rivers in the LEGO world but I see it more as an average quality set rather than one of the highflyers that is remembered for years to come.</span></p>
