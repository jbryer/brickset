"ratz","2007-03-20T06:34:34.153Z","taxi driver","from today's perspective this small blue cab looks somewhat ridiculous, since it does not even seat a minifig. the proper view would be to see it as a part of lego-history, it represents these few years when there were already minifigs, but buildings and vehicles did not necessarily fit them.
apart from that you get some really nice parts: a &quot;taxi&quot;-printed tile (note how it is placed on the roof!), a clear slope, and a classic minifig.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"shenron","2007-12-28T03:30:38.42Z","Not in scale","One of the last vehicle models that didn't accomodate a minifig inside, this set looks somewhat ridiculous nowadays, and in fact the design is very limited.

However it has a certain appeal to the eye (I don't know why but I insisted so much about getting this set when I was a child) perhaps because of the nice color scheme shared by car and driver.

In a Legoland diorama the car doesn't fit anymore, and this model should probably better just be used for parts to build something else. Incidentally, the 2x1 flat printed TAXI sign is unique to this small set.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"cowboycoder","2021-05-14T16:16:36.07Z","A classic of its time.","<p>Released towards the end of the phase that&nbsp;introduced&nbsp;the Minifig, this is one of the last of the&nbsp;small vehicles which couldn&#39;t accommodate the included figure. It would be easy to judge this harshly, as a failing, especially when viewed in comparison to the sets that have been released in the years since, but this overlooks the set&#39;s appeal at the time.</p>

<p>Clearly aimed at an entry price point, the part count is low, but nothing is wasted. The Taxi itself is based on an established design, having been used in a number of 6XX Town sets, with the rear adapted to represent a larger passenger compartment.&nbsp;An all-black livery may have more readily represented a Black Cab, but the addition of the blue lower half makes for&nbsp;a much brighter and more attractive livery.</p>

<p>The included figure cleverly matches this livery, with the use of blue legs and black printed torso, meaning there can be no mistaking the pairing of vehicle and driver, and certainly adds to the visual appeal of the set.</p>

<p>The parts selection is, as has been stated, minimal, but the addition of the exclusive printed tile, and the associated lesson on advanced connection techniques more than makes up for this.</p>

<p>Scoring then;</p>

<p>Parts:&nbsp;4.&nbsp;A modest selection for sure, but&nbsp;+1 for the printed tile.</p>

<p>Building Experience: 4. Easy to assemble, the instructions are concise, the vehicle comes together quickly. +1 for the way the tile is attached.</p>

<p>Playability: 4. Though it doesn&#39;t have any active play features, the addition of the Minifig adds to the playability, and the back of the box offers a number of alternate builds to fire the imagination.</p>

<p>Value For Money: 5. It has to be top marks on this, as they were so well priced. You could get a Matchbox/Hotwheels car, or a small&nbsp;Lego set like this.</p>

<p>Overall: 5. With the part count, and part selection that was available at the time, it&#39;s hard to see how it could be any better without at least doubling the price point. These days something like this would be a polybag given free with purchase or on a magazine, and wouldn&#39;t get such a high rating, but for its time, it is a perfect&nbsp;classic.</p>

"peti7788","2021-02-17T21:03:50.43Z","You will not get to your destination with this taxi","<p>What was the &quot;artist&quot; (designer)&nbsp;thinking?&nbsp;He&nbsp;certainly didn&rsquo;t think this car should carry passengers either.</p>

<h3><strong>Taxi</strong></h3>

<p>Why release a set that has a minifigure but is not to scale&nbsp;with a taxi.&nbsp;Blue taxis are not very common, yellow would have been better.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifig</strong></h3>

<p>The driver is very stylish, he even has a hat and his red shirt is quite unique.&nbsp;Maybe after work he takes off his cap and plays in a punk band. :)&nbsp;Who knows? After all, everyone needs a hobby, we have lego as our hobby.</p>

<h3><strong>Overall&nbsp;opinion</strong></h3>

<p><strong>The new lego town&nbsp;really needed a taxi, one that could carry passengers.</strong> It looks like an alternative construction of a basic set.&nbsp;Another minifigure would have been good as a passenger.</p>

<h3><strong>My Mod</strong></h3>

<p>The goal was to fit 2 minifigures in the taxi. Preferably from parts available in 1979. I did not use a prefabricated vehicle base.&nbsp;Maybe 1 or 2 parts more of this version than the original set.&nbsp;</p>
