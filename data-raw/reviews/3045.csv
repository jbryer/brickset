There is a jail, secret entrance, and several other cool bits to this set.  A couple more horse riders would have been good, and maybe another tower to help make this set better.  My only real problem is with that dragon head at the front door.  It would make a better figure head placed over the door.  All in all, a set worth the money.

Lots of big chunky rocks, wierd unrealistic dragon head, no living space... bad news. Though a far cry from the horror that was the Fright Knights, the fact remains that this set has a pretty crappy design. It's saving grace is the awesome trapdoor (much better than that in 6081) and the wizards study. Without them, the rating would be a five. We need to see more of the medieval town stuff, I'm tired of this dark gothic crap.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"legotrainfan","2007-10-20T08:16:59.45Z","Nice traps","This castle has two cool traps. First, there is a trapdoor. The minifigs that step on it will directly land in the dragon's cave. Of course, there is a mechanism that allows you to block the trapdoor. The other trap is the dragon head near the castle's entrance. You can put 1x1 bricks in its mouth. Remove a lance and the tongue of the head goes downwards. The bricks fall out of its mouth and thus directly on the heads of unwanted intruders. 

Right under the dragon head and next to the rock brick, there is a castle wall with hinges. The hinges allow you to open it. If this was intended as a secret door or just a way of giving you better access to a particular area of the castle, I do not know. 

It's a pity that the dragon cave needs so much space. There is not enough space for the minifigs. You can only put them on the upper level, where the trapdoor is. On the lower level, there is just enough space for the knight's horse and the prison.

When you buy the set, you get several minifigs: one knight with a cape and a horse, three soldiers, a wizard and a wolfpack minifig. So you should have enough minifigs. And, of course, you get a dragon and a treasure chest. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-05-07T11:41:59.107Z","Dragon Heart","This castle is built atop the lair of a dragon, and it is decorated appropriately with a dragon's head that spews rock from its mouth.  That feature is fun.  The top of the castle is also interesting, with a nice tower capped by the red roof and quite a bit of space for the soldiers to parade in as well as a ladder to get there.  Another nice touch is the brown tree with green leaves to the right of the castle.  What's not so nice is that the dragon's lair is basically a big hole and the &quot;door&quot; to the lair is flimsy.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-08-11T19:16:15.78Z","Well done, Lego! Nice job on this set!","6082 FIRE BREATHING FORTRESS 

This set was released in 1993, though in some countries the date had changes, as example, I saw on a catalog from 1994 (from Brazil) with this set entitled as new. This set is one of the big sets from the subtheme of dragon knights, started in the same year of this set, 1993. This subtheme have too some other knights (and characteristics) of other subthemes, as example, this set includes a minifigure from a character of the Wolfpack. 

This set includes too the first version of the Lego dragon, common among many other themes, like knights kingdom 1 and fright knights. This dragon is a green one (the same of the sets 6056 and 6076). These contents are some characteristics of the subtheme, though the dragons were used on Fright knights too with other colors. As a big set this have a great quantity of pieces. But the quantity isn't much for big prices, there are 393 pieces on this.

The contents are useful for castle and for other fortress, also buildings of city. In consideration that the main part of the set is built on a baseplate 32 x 32 raised with ramp and pit with gray and black rocks pattern (the big piece that is the floor of the set), this so could be considered as not so big set. But actually it is big in details and the uses of the pieces are good, as example some technic pieces compatible in the same time with system makes this set be useful for creations and it's first model be creative. This big piece is practically the main part of the set, and the first steps of building keep with it. The designs of this fits perfectly for the whole set, being the ramp to the main gate of the castle or the great designs of rocks on the piece of green color. 

In the early building of the set, starting from the big baseplate, is easy see being added pieces at the pit of the big piece to add more place to the building of the set keeping hidden a few part of the pit. And this set too have some arch pieces in a side what makes this nicely designed and those are well fixed to the big baseplate. The design of the big baseplate works too for the building and keeps a good design, like the ramp on it that go directely to the main gate of the castle, that opens well and have a nice design along with all the building on the sides and the arch above. 

The second gate of it (one that is on the left side of the dragon's head and don't looks like a door) is too well placed to the set, though it is not made of plates (as in some castles from the 80's years like some from Lion knights and Black knights) this fits well for the entrance and exit of the dragon and don't frustrates the playability of the other side, this that is open to minifigures. The pit is a good place to the dragon and it is too a place where the minifigure can falls from the second floor. Some pillars can helps in the building keeping the second floor, that shares the place with a tree built on one rock piece. To make the castle more realistic, this by slope pieces with studs (what I consider as a rare piece) connected some red plates to it looks like tiles and are great designed along with the floor. Though this fortress was built in a &quot;hill&quot;, this have likeness with castles by pieces known sometimes as panels that are actually wall with holes to looks like with windows from castle. In the set too have some plates and bricks to fix those panels and the second floor, but there are so many forms to do that with this set and due to that, is better searching for the types of buildings than describing one by one the forms to keep the set, as example, by simple bricks or plates, or plates with claws...and many other types of pieces.

Some pieces there turned common on the theme, like the rock pieces, that could be bricks in many sets, but on this works well because it is empty inside and can make some cool traps or only keep space to minifigures inside the fortress. These are relatively next each to other, on the sides of the gate to the pit, or to the dragon's nest. Some parts from the early part of the building helps to playability at all and also to the other steps of the building. The stair on the set as example is putted above the plates that were added to hidden some parts of the pit to keeps the place more playable with minifigures. The stair is a bit visible from the open part of the fortress, and is too a common piece on some sets, and is another example of what could be replaced by bricks, but again in the case of this set this works well. Upper this stair...can be found the second floor...

The second floor have too great design and at all playability. One trap is located too on it, by 2x2 bricks with holes kept on the building of pillars from the first floor, hidden. The trap can be placed very well to don't make the minifigure fall, have a exact place to put a device made by plates and other pieces that follows the old gray color scheme from the second floor and looks like with the black from the first one. With castle turrets and few plates this &quot;device&quot; can be hidden, and the fortress can receive more likeness with castles. Pillars and slope pieces (some that were used in the building of the first floor and to keeps the second one) was made a little place that is well positioned to archers use, because it is above the place of minifigures in the first floor. To add more likeness with castle (or only to adds more contents, because with all those steps follow this set is one great castle)  another panel (or simply wall) was putted next to the second floor above the slope and pillar pieces to above it, the building be increased by archs and too castle turrets and a roof piece (in shape of half pyramid) makes this part of the set a tower, great addition to any castle made with simple pieces (and a roof piece). On the second floor have a big place to keep much minifigures, but a place is dangerous if the device of the trap is removed. This is a bit hidden but fits well to don't remove the plates that keeps the dragon's head on the other side. 

The dragon's head is similar in comparison with the head from the set 6043, but this by one 2x2 brick with hole can have a spear (of joust) to make the tongue of it keeps bricks or small pieces inside the mouth. This keeps well in the castle by technic plates with holes with a technic axle crossing it.

When the building is complete, so is time to play with the set... The dragon can be considered as in minifigure schale or as not, but have some likeness with another contents of lego from the times of the set, and fits well with any minifigure to make it looks like a dragon rider than some other dragons. The designs of this dragon is great and the colors (green and red) makes so much resemblances with the subtheme. Have three minifigures of Dragon knights that are the same, with differences only in weapons (one with crossbow, another with sword and other with longbow), details (one have shield and other have arrows on back) and the helmets (two have helmets with neck protector and other have one included on the set 1289, as example). The other Dragon knight have more equipments like the helmet with details of dragon, have too a cape and on many images this rides a horse, with a special head armor to it. Includes too another minifigures, the Wizard (the classic one), known as Majisto in some sets, and the character of Wolfpack. 

This set have great playability, on the back of the first floor and in almost all the second floor, a playability safe of fall of minifigures in the pit. The back of the first floor is a bit open, and is easy see the three gates, that are exactly the main one (from where the ramp over), another in the front of the castle, on sides of the rocks and the main entrance for the pit. Also in the pit is good to play, but is recommended to play more with it as a trap. Traps are things common on this set, like the third door, that can be named too as a prision. And too the playability with other traps, like the dragon's stones, that the head on the top can throw only removing a piece from it. And this head too can moves to the sides, what makes the intruders have no chance against the fortress. 

It is rare now, but you can find it by internet. In ebay you find this by different prices, but the average is $49.99, but it depends about have box, if it is complete and have the instructions. If you search this item in bricklink you can find a complete also by $50.00. It is the main price of this set currently, due to the rarity it is now, and also (of course) about the pieces included. I think that this price worth if you want to get more additions (like a classic castle) to your collection.  

About useful contents, it have a lot, or exactly 393 useful pieces. This set don't includes stickers, some details are printed (like in the baseplate and in the tower's details), that I consider better than stickers. As in the description of building, this set being not a bucket of bricks, I will not describe the pieces, but some were said to only make know their true importance. Some pieces like the staircase, the rocks and the big baseplate are good to this set, but sometimes it cuts the use of bricks and plates. But bricks and plates, some original pieces are also included with this set, what makes this a great and creative set, inside or outside this castle. 

And other contents are the minifigures, with this set you can get a number of minifigures close to a minifigure pack. The weapons are great too, also spears and lances are on this, if you don't want to put them on minifigures, them along with flags can makes the set have more itens on it. It have also as only Lego can make, other types of building showing on it's box. Examples of those other models are a tower, and the other is another type of castle, don't using the big baseplate, if this you consider as a problem in the set. A 5 out of 5 with no doubt, as a big (or not so big) set, it is very great! :)

"MPH","2009-04-06T14:18:35.797Z","Great colors, pretty good design","Some people don't really like the dragon knights (""the beginning of the end"", as I've read in one of the reviews), but I kinda dig this set. What is probably the most attractive are its colors: very, very contrasty with black, light gray, green and red and a bit of dark gray, brown and yellow. Nice!

The height of the fortress is also impressive, of course partly due to the raised baseplate. The use of that baseplate is OK in this set, but it's a pity the ramp-part is so bare... it makes the fortress very narrow and the ugly, oversized dragon head almost a necessity to beef up the left side. 

Apart from that, I like the rest of the design. I don't really mind that the ground floor is cramped, since there is plenty of room on the first floor and even a small second floor under that nice red roof. There is also a jail cell for the wolfpack guy and a nice stair leading up to the first floor - many sets (e.g. 6074, 6276) lack this kind of realism! The tree structure, combined with the LURPs, really gives this set the appearance of a fortification in a rocky, mystic forest. Well done!
There are also many traps 'n' tricks, such as the dragon head, the fake wall and the falling floor; but I don't really care for them, as I prefer display over play.

Finally, six minifigs is OK for a set this size, but still a bit disappointing as this is the largest set in the dragon knight theme. Most largest-sets-of-a-castle-theme have about ten minifigs (but no dragon, that's true).",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mars4life","2009-01-10T19:19:04.06Z","Best of the Dragon Knights","I recently got this set off eBay for 31 USD, which is a good deal considering it is a 366 piece set. I really like it!

This set has lots of features, including a huge trapdoor, a jail, a collapsing wall and a dragon head that drops rocks. First of all, I have to say that the dragon head looks ugly and terrible, and the rock dropping feature doesn't work. I didn't even bother to put it on, and it looks much better. The trapdoor is really big and you can't tell it is there by looking, so it is really great. The jail is rather small and cramped, but I don't mind, and who cares if the imprisoned person is uncomfortable? The collapsing wall is okay, I'm not sure if it for the bad guys to get in or for the defenders to get out, though it's probably not the latter because it is right next to the door. I also liked that this set has a large tree on it because it looks great and adds to the scenery.

The build for this set was a little difficult because the instructions were somewhat fast-paced, and they didn't have the little box before each step showing what pieces to use. This made it easy to accidentally skip something.

This set has six minifigures, and they are all cool. The wizard has a crystal ball and a cool glow in the dark wand, and there are lots of extra weapons.

If you are a Lego pirates fan, you can easily turn this into a Spanish fort by replacing the soldiers' helmets with the Spanish conquistador helmets, and give them the blue shoulder pad things from the British soldiers(In the new pirate theme there are usually extras included). All the soldier's faces look Spanish already, besides the leader, who has red hair. This would also save you a lot of money because if you buy the soldiers on eBay they are about ten dollars cheaper than the real Spanish soldiers. Considering that Lego never released a Spanish fort, I think that it is a good idea.

If you wanted to make this set REALLY good, you should add Majisto's Tower (1906) as a second gate at the bottom of the ramp and add walls all around the outer edge. If you need more space in the castle you can add another platform in the pace where the dragon goes to make another floor.

I really love this set, it is one of my favorite sets, and I recommend you buy it. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Adrock","2022-02-07T19:59:50.033Z","Has got better with age","<p>it&#39;s funny, but I can still remember the first time I opened a 1993 catalogue and was heartbroken at the fact that the crusaders / Lion Knights had disappeared. In fact, it felt like even my heroes&nbsp;- the Black Knights - had been pushed aside in favour of the new, cool kids on the block. The Dragon&nbsp;Knights&nbsp;just changed the whole feeling of the castle theme, and whilst I went on to receive all of their sets except this one, I never felt that they sat that well next to the older castle sets. They just looked different - different colours, very different armour, weapons and facial expressions. To add insult to injury, they even stole my knights shield design, with just the blue border changed to green!</p>

<p>However, after returning to Lego a couple of years ago, I decided to&nbsp;fill in the few castle gaps from these years. This set was one, and I got it&nbsp;for an absolute bargain in mint condition online. You could tell by the way the pieces looked and snapped together they had never been played with. It was actually a very enjoyable build - much better than many of today&#39;s sets. And what&#39;s more, with my five-year-old, I couldn&#39;t&nbsp;believe just how much play value there is in this design. It&#39;s feels a bit more robust and seems to have more features that some of the earlier, mid-sized designs. For example, the secret entrance, the prison, the trap door, Merlin&#39;s tower, the cave for the dragon with secret potion inside the treasure chest - not to mention an absolutely brilliant set of minifigs. You can play &quot;rescue the wolf man&quot;, or free Merlin, or protect Merlin etc etc so many options! So, I think this set has aged very well, and actually looks classic but not dated with nice bright colours. My solution too - keep all of the dragon knights set separate from the 1992 and before sets. Pit them against the royal knights, with only the odd wolf man crossing over into 92, and that&#39;s your&nbsp;answer!</p>
