"A_Brickset_user","2003-07-13T00:00:00Z","","This set was fun, and is a good Ninja add-on. The ruby and the goblets go inside in the instructions, but are outside on the cover and box (it isn't abnormal, since the cover is commonly a bit different from the instructions.) There is a single axe that falls across the room, when you pull one of those three stud long pins with a stud on the end of it out. There is also a catapult covered by leaves on the second story, and FOUR EXTRA SPEARS (!), two on each side of the stronghold. Could anyone tell me what those stone things that are on the front corners of the baseplate are. My guess would have to be lanterns, but the building has those already, and also there are no pieces that indicate fire on them.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Novelty","2007-07-17T07:00:38.09Z","Hakodate","This tower may not be as majestic as the other sets, but there are a variety of elements in it that deserves some mention - the koi fish on the roof, the attempt to replicate japanese ground lanterns, the flags on the doors and the greenery that is so pervasive on the set.  There is also a nice feature in the set where it is possible to rain down stones onto the front of the door.  However the door itself is a little bit boring and can be easily rammed through with a simple ram - that structural weakness may have been deliberate.  The colours aren't too &quot;out there&quot; but they aren't too cohesive as a whole either.  This may be a middling set, but it's a fun one too.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"WiseWarrior","2008-10-31T19:41:52.06Z","Best Ninja set!","This was the 4th, and last Ninja fortress I got, and my favorite one. It has the awesome doors, vines, and no BURPS. The figures are very cool, and so are the lamps outside the stronghold. While you can only get it online now, it's a great deal if you can find it cheap.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Naylus","2022-01-23T10:53:57.667Z","Vigilant Tower","<p>I remember the feeling, when I learnt that I would soon open a box with Japanese theme Lego. It took me a little time to build the tower itself, but I&#39;m positive that was a pleasant experience.</p>

<p>This set uses the very classic bricks of older times, but they are put together in such a way, that sometimes you are amazed that Lego can have the Japanese look just like that. Besides classic bricks the set has really nice rare details like orient doors, red gem, vine plant, fish statues and some others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set includes katanas and a plastic flag. The tower is equipped with a small trap of falling stones.</p>

<p>The minifigures are also a very nice addition to your collection, including a samurai, a guard and a ninja. Even though&nbsp;there are only three of them &ndash;&nbsp;this makes the set something of a battlepack.</p>

"AETerry","2011-01-25T12:30:55.207Z","Samurai Stronghold Review","<p>Much as I love the Ninja Minifigures, I also love the Samurai Minifigures too and this set provided a way to get some of the Samurai and provide a stronghold or fort of sorts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The set isn't bad, there's 3 minifigures, 1 ninja and 2 samurai. There's just a lot of detail put into this set to really suggest a setting over in Feudal Japan from the Koi Fish, to ribbing of bricks, styling of flags, the stone work at the corners of the set and doors. I greatly enjoyed this set and being able to get more Samurai then Ninja.</p>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,4
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-07-18T12:49:40.77Z","LEGO Castle (Ninja) - Samurai Stronghold Review","This is one of the LEGO Castle (Ninja) sets which you should try to get for sure. It has no stickers which you have to worry about and you get 3 minifigs in this set. The set is easy to build and it's very sturdy. I like the design of this tower. It has two spears on each side, a lantern on each side on the front, some nice flags on the doors and on the top, a gem in the inside, a falling axe and falling rocks. It also has a green rope where the black ninja can climb up to the top and attack his enemies. I'm very happy with the play features we get here but I think there could have been more in this set. But I still think that this model is a cool set to have.<br><br>All

"Harmonious_Building","2012-08-02T09:10:02.647Z","Shogun showdown.","<p>It is somewhat surprising to me that LEGO took such a long time to cotton on to the fact that its not-quite-straight roof pieces make for very pleasant looking Japanese-style roofs, which therefore lends itself almost at once to a Japanese-themed line. I guess LEGO was understandably operating in Euro-centric mode, but it's great that the strangely-titled Ninja subtheme finally made it out of the gates in the end. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Had I not been a pathetic little pre-teen at the time of Ninja's release, I might have considered collecting the entire line simply because it's a (loosely) historical one. Some of the designs were a bit touch-and-go - natural, I suppose, when one considers any brand-new line - but I was lucky enough to pick up Samurai Stronghold, which is one of the best sets of the theme, in my opinion. There's few gimmicks here to detract from the great design, which does an excellent job of conveying a kind of outpost/shrine hidden high up in the mountains. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Three Minifigs in a $20 set is certainly starting things out on a high note; I should state that one of the best things about Ninja was the sheer number&nbsp;of new moulds that we got at the time.&nbsp;The first is the titular&nbsp;armoured samurai, who is very impressive with his gold horns, looking like he walked right out of a Kurosawa movie. He is accompanied by his squire or something - what do they call those guys? Chugen? Zoshiki? Don't remember, but this junior samurai is another wonderful inclusion, and the great-looking flag piece is a nice bonus. Finally, we get a ninja, a forerunner of the&nbsp;now-wildly-popular <a href=""http://brickset.com/browse/themes/?theme=Ninjago"">Ninjago</a> theme, and this was particularly cool not just because he's a&nbsp;ninja, but because he had a little clip behind his hood where one could store his sword. That's Japanese efficiency for you. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The stronghold itself is a pretty simple, symmetric build, and there aren't any real surprises that would baffle even a slightly experienced builder. Instead, it's a clever combination of old and new pieces that work together to give an otherwise simple construction a distinctive ""oriental"" look. From the cross-pattern gate pieces to the use of aforementioned slope pieces and the little stone lanterns adorning the front, this set does a great job of conveying Meiji-era architecture in spite of piece limitations. At the same time, we get a bunch of new pieces to sweeten the deal. The most striking of these are the ""koi"" adornments on the roof, which are absolutely charming and are great for East Asian MOCs of any kind. The printed flags are also great and match up perfectly with the Minifig design.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And if it's playability you're after, this set does that, too. With a jewel placed conspicuously in the front lawn, conflict between the samurai clan and the sneaky ninjas is inevitable, and a variety of tricks and traps will keep young kids busy. Form and function - it can work. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, I do remember this set fondly, and I lament that we haven't really had a new fully-fledged historical theme since Ninja, and with the toyetic Ninjago selling like hotcakes (can toys themselves be toyetic?), it's unlikely that we'll see a slightly more ""realistic"" Japanese theme anytime soon. Still, the world's a lot bigger than Japan, so I can only hope that LEGO decides to take a bold move with another historical foray. In the meantime, fans of Japanese culture won't be disappointed with Samurai Stronghold; hopefully you still have yours, because gods know where mine is. </p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,4
"Ernst","2011-07-24T18:45:36.25Z","Samurai Stronghold - a surprising good set","<p>Although the Ninja theme is connected to my favorite theme Castle I never really looked at the sets until I got my hands on this set being part of deal I made with 12 sets. Now having build it, Ninja has got my attention too, nice theme and this particular set is a very nice set to built and to own.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Building is fun, the stronghold has 2 floors and Lego has used several good recognizable parts, some curved both big and small which make it fun to build. It is not hard to built so 4 bricks here.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The parts get the full 5 bricks, Lego used clever curved parts in several different colours which makes the stronghold definitly an Oriental building. The set contains 3 lovely shields and an equal&nbsp;banner and the 2 Koi Carps are an excelent detail. It has 3 great different minifigures who are well armed although I think the gun for the Shogun is overdue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability 5 bricks because of the completeness of this set, all is present to play with. You don&#39;t need extra sets or figures to have a fun time with it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value gets 4 bricks, Brickline estimates this set on &euro;22,50 which I think is a good evaluation. Being part of a 12 set deal I don&#39;t have an exact amount what I paid for it but in a single sale I would give the Bricklink value for it.</p>
