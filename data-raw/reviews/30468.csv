<p>Attached to the cover of Issue 28 of&nbsp;the Lego City Comic is Harl Hubbs and his whacker plate.&nbsp; You also get a small barrier construction in the packet too.&nbsp; The comic was &pound;4.99 in the UK, up &pound;1.00 from the last issue but containing an additional old comic set too.&nbsp; I got <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/951911-1/Space-Buggy"">951911</a> the Space Buggy which I also gave 5/5 so this was fantastic to get again.&nbsp; The additional older sets do sometimes differ so it may have been another one for some people.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The front of the larger foil packet has a large image of Harl Hubbs using the brick-built whacker plate and shows the bright yellow barrier in the background with the included shovel propped against it.&nbsp; Just under the Lego City logo is an inset image of Harl holding a hammer.</p>

<p>The back of the packet comprises of two blue sections containing safety information and the 1:1 image is of one of the three reddish brown 1x1 round plates that also come with the set.</p>

<p>The two sub builds here are harder than you would expect in a 4+ set, so I think the 5+ age is a fair rating based on those sets.&nbsp; Although I doubt younger children would strugle to build with supervision.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Harl is a great looking Minifigure, there is detail printed on both sides of his torso and on the front of his legs.&nbsp; This exact version of Harl can be found in three other sets <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-minifig-cty1074"">here</a>.&nbsp; This makes him quite rare as of January 2021.&nbsp; The best retail price for a set he is in is &pound;34.99.</p>

<p>He comprises the following parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hair - <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6267760"">Reddish Brown Mini Wig No 105</a></li>
	<li>Head - <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6267083"">Bright Yellow Mini Head No 2916</a> (which is printed on both sides)</li>
	<li>Torso - <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6267089"">Bright Red Mini Upper Part No 4740</a>&nbsp;(also printed on both sides)</li>
	<li>Belt -&nbsp; <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6268126"">Dark Orange Mini Equipment No 2</a></li>
	<li>Legs - <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6267111"">Earth Blue Mini Lower Part No 1724</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The belt is the rarest part currently and only appears in two sets other than here, one of which is priced &pound;169.99 in the UK!</p>

<p>For me the printing here is fantastic.&nbsp; You get two great facial expressions and the open top button of his shirt and broken strap of his dungarees added to the detail on the legs of paint splatter and a patched knee makes him look like he works really hard.</p>

<p>I have never seen the series that Harl is from so cannot compare his appearance in it&nbsp;to how he appears here.</p>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>Not only do you get the best Minifigure to have been attached to the Lego City Comic, but you get a 7 part whacker plate build, that is simple but great.&nbsp; The textured 2x2 round brick works so well to give the impression of vibration.&nbsp; The barrier build is simple too, but when used in any Lego city would give the other Minifigures the protection they would need from the works being undertaken.</p>

<p>The parts used work well and the inclusion of three 1x1 round reddish brown bricks gives you just enough mud to play with.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>This is the best free comic set to date.&nbsp; If you got the Bulldozer from a few issues ago then they compliment each other brilliantly.</p>

<p>For &pound;4.99 this set was great value.&nbsp; Collectable Minifigures now cost &pound;3.49 and don&#39;t have side builds like this or a comic!&nbsp; The only way this could have been improved would have been to give Harl his hammer, pictured in the inset image, as an additional tool to use.&nbsp; That however is the only criticism I can give.</p>

<p>The next issue comes with a diver and a shark, and I hope it&#39;s as good at this set has been.</p>
