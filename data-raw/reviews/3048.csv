This castle set is the king of all castles ever made. This castle is the childhood dream of many people including me. What can i say? This set outshines all the other castle sets with its superbly designed structure and heroic knights. &quot;Black Monarch&quot; itself is a legendary name. Highly recommended to everyone!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-07-16T06:49:59Z","superbly designed castle","When i first bought this set on my birthday i hardly resisted myself to destroy its outer package to reach it. It has a jail, a nicely working drawbridge, a portcullis, high black front walls and leant-shaped back towers. 8 men-at-arms, 3 knights and the dark overlord Black Monarch inhabits this great fortress.When you open it with its hinges into a glorious long wall it seems really challenging. Once the gates of this dark tower are opened no mans heart can overcome the overwhelming fear of being trampled under the charging steeds of the Black Monarch and his knights. The best evil scheme made to date. And the most stylish castle apparently.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

It might be the castle of Sheriff of Nottingham since in UK the forestmen were declared as Robin Hood and his friends. This castle has so delicately thought details that no castle could reach its supremecy. 6080 is too square compared to this. 6086 looks good only from one corner, the other sides are open(raised baseplate limits it as well). 6090 looks magnificent but it has lots of big block pieces which makes some discontinuity on the walls. And 6074 is rather a cottage compared to this although it is good as well .Not to mention about silly knight(i dont think so) kingdoms.

I think this deserves to become a legend(well i had to pay 150usd for an unopened one) I remember it showing on lego brochurres from 1988 to 1992 or so which means it is one of the most-lasting castles set. Its probably the most interesting feature is that it is a black castle which gives it a sinister and impressive look.And with 6080 (after the yellow castle) 6085 is the most crowded castle with 12 minifigs.

other castles. I owned 2 knights stronghold 6059 and joined all of them to have a 
great sized castle. Later using the instructions of 6080 i custom made a black 6080 
and recombined all to make huge castle which is now home to a stable, a

I tried to make that alternate model a few different occasions and got pretty close once.  It's a really neat alternate model!  But the original model is totally excellent.

I like the crests and the flag above the portcullis, which is made of bricks!  This makes the it look heavy and imposing.

It was really great to build it and I was very proud of myself when I had put the last brick in its place. It has a prison and the left and right side of the castle can be reconfigured. Hinges and two bricks with holes and a technic pin make it possible. This also allows you to add other castles. So you can put several castles together with your medieval town in the centre.

Functionally it is interesting, with the Technic clip at the back and the hinges which allows it to be easily reconfigured. There are stairs at the back and a jail cell at the back.

(part two)

This is the second (and last) part of my review about the set 6085 (Black Monarch's castle). As I said before, this set includes many useful contents and feature a nice design, though the color scheme is simple. The building of this set is complex, but with instructions it can be made easily. The 665 pieces included makes this set a great and classic set.

Building steps (part 1, the back of the castle):
In the first steps of the building, this set uses as base two baseplates with size of 16X16 studs. Above, the two baseplates are connected by two 2X1 bricks with hole, which uses as connection a gray technic pin. This technic pin connects very well the baseplates, making it playable and hard to dismantle when playing. The first bricks to make the castle structure are putted after, above the baseplate. On the back of each baseplate, some slope bricks are used to make the walls that will later help to make the back of the castle. Some bricks are used to connect some black panels on it's back, completing the walls of the back of the castle. At the sides, more black bricks will make the walls, and these makes the 1X4 hinge bricks stay a bit hidden. At the back, some slope bricks finish the structure of the walls, and by extension complete the connection of the two baseplates, strengthening the connection, and the whole set.

Yet in the back of the castle, a wall increase it inside, making it a bit assymetric (not outside, but inside), but increasing the building and playability. This part of the back uses exactly eight panel pieces to make the walls, but these pieces are even increased by some gray colored plates (with divergences in sizes, but with sizes like 1X2 studs to 1X10 studs). At the external sides of the wall, (in each side), two torch pieces increases the design of the set, exactly being used as torchs (it is obvious). 

The building of the castle turrets begins above the corners of the wall, using two 3X6 plates without corners (two in each corner of the walls) as the main bases of the turrets, and after, one 3X3X6 panel wall (one in each turret) makes the structure of the turrets recognizable. After it, more panel walls makes the turret's structure, and a space to put the minifigure inside the turret increases even more the playability (the space that left over to put a minifigure inside each turret is exactly a space of 4X4 studs). In the first floor (above the baseplates), a cage can be built, using as base a space of 6X6 in a baseplate, and using a panel as wall. It have a barred door, where the minifigure can hold (with the &quot;hands&quot;), and as the teat, this &quot;cage&quot; uses a 6X8 black plate. The &quot;cage&quot; is connected in the wall by a sequence of double slope bricks (inverted). This &quot;cage&quot; (at least the door makes it looks like a cage, and the space inside, too) add more playability and details to the set. Now, at the second floor once again, the building continues, making some &quot;windows&quot; with arch pieces, above a part of the walls, between the turrets. These windows are increased by some 1X2 bricks above, adding a reallistic design to the castle, and making it very creative too. Above the panels of the turrets, the building continues with more 3X6 plates without corners, and above these, some inverted slope bricks and 2X2 corner round bricks increases the design. The turrets are later finished by some bricks above, adding details and a cool-looking design to the set. You have to note that some panel pieces aren't only black, because some have printed details.

Building steps (part 2, the front of the castle):
This part of the set is a bit more detailed (though the back of the castle have some notable details like the turrets, windows, the &quot;cage&quot; and walls), because it have the gate and the structure to support it. As the central part of the set (central part because you can divide the back corners of the castle, making a wall in the place of a castle. If you make it, this will be the center), this part uses as main base a 16X32 green baseplate. This baseplate is connected with the other two (other two wich are used in the back of the castle) by some bricks. This connection is a bit more weak than a connection using bricks with holes and technic pins, but don't dismantle easily too, because in each side, two hinge bricks connects (the hinge brick used as top, and the used as base). It also can makes the parts of the back divides, making a wall in place of a castle. To increase this part, there are some more slope pieces, that will later be completed by bricks. The front of the castle can be a bit more recognized when the part under the gate is being built. Some panels occupies the incomplete (incomplete until you use the panels) spaces between some slope bricks, increasing the set. Also, some slope bricks are used focused to inside the castle, adding more details to it. 

After it, some hinge bricks connects again the two parts of the set, and can also divides it, making a wall. It add more resistance (and by extension, playability) to the whole set, and don't affects the design, because some plates are used above. Next to the part that the gate will be made, two slope bricks &quot;create&quot; the structure of an arch. Adding some bricks and 1X2 plates, it turn more recognizable. Turned into the castle, (and at the same time, strengthening the part that will later makes the gate), some 1X1 plates with horizontal clips (exactly one in each side) connects two spears (one in each side again), just to add a complex style to the design of the set. The structure turns more recognizable when more panels are putted above the base made by the slope bricks (located at the front of the castle). These panels are connected with the part next to the gate by more gray plates. These are by extension, even more increased by black bricks, adding more medieval looking, and making the front of the castle more compatible with the turrets (not in shape, but in terms of design and color scheme). At the front, some inverted slope bricks, combined with more black regular bricks abuse of the creativity, adding more reallistic details to the castle. And above the gate, there is being formed another structure, a big turret (but more than a simple turret, this features many details). 

At each side of the structure, there is a sufficient space to put many minifigures, exactly, in each side it have space of 5X4 studs. In each side, after it, one slope brick, increased by more plates and bricks. This part also have plates with horizontal clips, but at this time, connecting a sword and a battle axe (but you can connect any weapon). In the same structure, each side is increased by panels, when the front is increased by more bricks and plates (with different color schemes, and shapes). These makes some &quot;medieval windows&quot; with retangular shape, and combined with the other part of the structure, this big turret looks like a face (not really a expressive face, but at least, it is very well detailed). The &quot;face&quot; is later increased by two arch pieces, above the region that is the equivalent of the &quot;eyes&quot; (in the castle, these are the windows of the front). This &quot;face&quot; in the front of the castle is finally finished when a combination among hinge plates is putted above its &quot;mouth&quot; (this &quot;mouth&quot; is made by a inverted double slope brick combinated with two 2X1 slope bricks). It will later makes its &quot;nose&quot;, when it will be connected with the flag. But now, at the fourth floor (above this &quot;face&quot;, there is a fourth floor), using some plates (plates with different shapes, including two &quot;wing&quot; plates) as base, there is also the system to open and close the gate. The gate is very well made, using only plates, and not only a piece (in castle sets before this time, is common to use only one or two pieces as gate). 

The gate is connected by a string (putted in the middle of the 3X2 plate with hole, used in the gate) which is connected in the castle passing through a 2X1 brick with hole, and later being fitted in a technic wheel. After it, there is another gate, that can open like a bridge. This is connected in the castle by a piece which is commonly used as a joust spear (in this case, it supports the first gate of the castle, a creative use). The first gate is also made by more than just one or two pieces, it is made by at least nine plates. To open or close this gate is very easy, you only have to spin the technic wheel in clockwise. This fourth floor is later finished by some bricks, adding to the castle a medieval looking, basically making another turret. After this step, the castle have only some details added, like the flags (located in the turrets of the back, in the &quot;nose&quot; of the front of the castle, and in each side of the castle's main tower). Also, the castle have added one brick 1X2 in each side of the main arch, these are putted in vertical position because are connected by bricks with headlights (one in each side). But it is just to add more details to the design. This set have too a small barrel piece where you can put some weapons (this set have exactly 4 battleaxes, 7 swords! 4 arrow quivers, 4 arrows with bows, 6 lances! 10 shields and 3 spears).

Playability:
Altough this set don't have a catapult, it is very cool to play with. The two gates can be opened easily and by a creative system, this set have 12 minifigures, 10 shields and 28 weapons (useful for the castle theme). Also, this set have four horses, that can be equipped with accessories, and includes many helmets and &quot;plumes&quot; to increase the helmets. These useful contents can add to this set a great playability. And it isn't all, this castle can divide the two baseplates used as bases of the castle's back, making a great wall (not very great, but with a great space to the 12 minifigures). It is hard to dismantle, so don't hesitate to play with this set (if you have, of course, or if you have at least an opportunity to play with this set). The set also features a &quot;cage&quot; (at least, this gray door inside suggests that it is a kind of cage, but you can play with the set as you like). Summarizing, the playability of this set is great.
And also, a interesting fact is that this set shows a playability and building a bit similar with the set 6080 (King's castle, from the lion knights subtheme), though the color scheme is different. But both sets (6085 and 6080) are very different in some terms, and both are without doubts, classic sets. Now, more about the playability of this set: This set have some alternative models shown at the box's back. One is a flagship, other is a small fort with space to &quot;play joust&quot; with the knights, and the other is a bridge between to towers. I couldn't find any instruction of these alternate models, but of course you can create your own castle, or use this to increase it.

Pros and Cons:
Here are the basic Pros and Cons about this set:

Pros:
includes 12 minifigures
lots of weapons and accessories
the castle don't dismantle easily
full of playability
nice design
includes 665 useful pieces

Cons:
none


Overall:
As I said in the first part of this review (this review have two parts, this is the second), this set is very hard to find now (this set was released in 1988, exactly 20 years ago), but you can find it in websites like bricklink and ebay, by a price by approx $90. Not very cheap for a set with 665 pieces, because it is rare, but worth completely the money. If you find this set more cheaper, and by extension, easy to get, don't hesitate! Get this chance! I recommend it.
So, overall, this set is a nice set, to collect,  play with, use the pieces in creations and it have basically none problem. If you are a Lego collector, or a Lego castle fan, this set is a great addition, a &quot;flawless castle&quot;. It deserves without doubt a five out of five. 5/5

The castle is brilliantly designed and has a great mix of light grey and black pieces, the prison features the more modern style cell door and is a massive improvement on 6080.

The walkway at the back is a great idea and the round towers and turrets look spot on. The front tower is imposing and well decorated. The portcullis (made of plates) and drawbridge are both easy to work (even if the brown lance casues it to fall of sometimes).

Brilliant minifig count of 12 including 4 horseman, two with bardings. Set hinges out on three baseplates and allows for more access inside. Def five star set with only two minor issues.

Pros
Loads of men and weapons.
Great colour scheme.
Round turrets look good.

The sloping columns placed in between the wall panels give it a solid, sturdy character that was missing in earlier castles.  And I love the crenelation on the turrets!  It was a very innovative use of a very old brick (the curvy one), that really adds character to the castle!  The front facade is imposing, and the design on the winches is much more natural than in earlier castles.  All in all, a great improvement on the castle design!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

<p>I remembered that magic day on september 2009 when I found it on ebay, coming out from my dark ages, and deciding to present myself the castle I have never had.&nbsp;I received a beautiful like-new model&nbsp;and soon I realized not only that my dream&nbsp;came true but, most&nbsp;important thing, why&nbsp;it is considered&nbsp;one of the real few icons of all the Lego brand.</p>
<p>And only once you build it you can understand and appreciate deeply the&nbsp;refined building techniques, the attenction for details.&nbsp;I'm not only talking about how all these features work well alone, but in particular how they fit togheter and melt each other <br/>in a fantastic overall design. First of all,&nbsp;about how well the wall's panels are incorporated in a more complex way with slope, inverted slope and angle panels bricks giving it, especially in the frontal facade, a very solid and strong feeling like in any castle before it, whereas the same walls were simply lined up and unadorned. The octagonal towers&nbsp;on both the sides close the rear of the castle&nbsp;in a so compact way that is a real challenge imagine to open a breach in and conquer it.</p>
<p>Lego group is here at his best.<br/>I think it stays exactly where it deserves to be, on the podium of the top rated sets, between the Black seas Barracuda and the Medieval Market. Everything&nbsp;comes perfect&nbsp;with this&nbsp;set.&nbsp;The big amount of minifigs and their new dedicated accessories, the colours and their good mix of black and grey, and even the name itself of the set is appropriate: ""Black Monarch's Castle"". It reminds you of something dark and misterious. The perfect opponents of the more bright Lion's Knights (maybe also more just? Nooo.....) </p>
<p>Without doubts, it is simply the best castle of all times and a must-have for every serious collector. <br/>Let's hope Kingdoms line will bring back Castle series to its glorious golden age. I would like. For all those castle fans like me.<br/></p>
<p>Thank you Lego for this authentic masterpiece.<br/>(and thank you everyone for forgiving my english)</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"SiaFu","2012-12-12T12:45:38.78Z","My most prized Castle","I still remember the day I got this castle. It was my largest LEGO set, took a whole afternoon to carefully build with all the other knights assembled and present on the kitchen table. It was to me a vast improvement over the now vaunted <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6080-1"">6080 King's Castle</a>. The overall colour scheme, main gate/tower complex and both crowned round towers were more aesthetically pleasing than the orthogonal grayness of the 6080. And I just liked the Dragons better ;-)<br>So I'll continue this review as a retrospective.<br><br>The four corners in the 6085 are well fortified and the front gate portcullis is closer to the edge of the baseplate allowing the full length of the drawbridge to go over the imaginary moat, whereas the 6080 King's castle has a nice field below the drawbridge, perfect for the attackers to park their siege machines. All openings in the towers also face the inner courtyard, which is not the case in some modern set castles (like <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=7946-1"">7946</a> or <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=7094-1"">7094</a>) whose towers are open in the back like a doll house.<br>The sloped elements in the base of the walls and sturdy tower crowns and crenellation all together make this castle appear very defensible against the many siege machines in the LEGO castle lineup.<br>So, as a medieval fortification - it's great.<br><br>As was customary with LEGO castles in the '80s, it can be opened in the rear section between the two round towers and connect to other castles to get more enclosed space. The only hitch is that it uses flat baseplates so there was always a height difference when I first connected it to <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=6074-1"">6074 Black Falcon's Fortress</a>, and finally <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=6059-1"">6059 Knight's Stronghold</a> which use 1/3 height green bases. Nevertheless, this connectivity and hinged walls were an advantage over 
the newer sets that come on plastic hills. You didn't have to 
disassemble them to connect them to your other (or your friends') 
castles and create a mega citadel to unite all the LEGO knights against 
some epic foe like a giant, dragon or whatever super-sized menace your 
toy collection offered.<br><br>It had several places that sparked your imagination to build on them.<br>The prison used the new frame with a single piece prison door, but had 
no railing on top, so you could use the extra bricks that came for the 
unsaddled horses to add a fence.<br>The space between the portcullis and 
the front tower windows could be used to mount weapons and trophies and the
 room in the main tower could be expanded to a balcony if you shifted a 
few pieces around from the original build, or borrowed from other sets.<br>On the other hand, you <span style=""font-style: italic;"">had to</span> imagine stairs or ladders between levels, as there are none (or build them yourself, say by ""<span style=""font-style: italic;"">borrowing</span>"" from the <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?set=6056-1"">6056 Dragon Wagon</a> like I did).<br>
<br>The generous garrison of four mounted knights (2 of them with then new barding), four footsoldiers and four archers was an instant army-builder (in my case, a <span style=""font-style: italic;"">faction </span>builder) and another good reason to get this set. There were several extra weapons (axes, swords, spears and shields) and the gate tower had a new flag with printed with the Dragon insignia.<br>Newer castles usually include some antagonists in each set, but I don't count that as a minus as I'd rather have the sizable castle garrison such as the one included here.<br><br>All in all it's still my favorite castle and provides a good base to expand into a castle complex, especially if you like its dark elegant colour.<br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5

Far off were the days of juniorization, far off were the massively overpriced Architecture sets. The designs were great too, and the best of the designs were found in the Castle line. This is one of my favorite of those designs, the Black Monarch's Castle.</span><div><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);""><br></span></div><div><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"">First off, the building experience. While I love LEGO's current sets, and many of them present very interesting builds, I've never much liked the insistence on showing us with big arrows where everything goes. The Black Monarch's Castle doesn't do any of this, with ten or so parts put on at a time. It makes it a lot more enjoyable to build.</span></div><div><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);""><br></span></div><div><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"">When the build is finished, it looks amazing. While grey castles look fine, they've always been a bit bland for me, whereas black makes a really imposing, powerful looking castle, that the forest men won't even consider robbing.</span></div><div><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);""><br></span></div><div><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"">The playability is also excellent. Not only are there arrow holes all around the castle, they aren't just there for looks! There are plates running around the full interior, allowing the multiple archers included to run around shooting at Black Falcons. Plus, if the Falcons get too close, the portcullis and drawbridge really work! The castle can also be opened and made into a longer castle with an open back if one so desires.</span></div><div><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);""><br></span></div><div><span style=""background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0);"">And a brief shout out to the minifigures. The newest big castle costs a whole 30 dollars more, yet only has half the number of minifigures this one has. Considering 6 minifigures is &nbsp;about right for a large set today, it's ridiculous to think that that number used to be more like 12!</span></div><div><br></div><div>The castle sets from the 80s are really amazing works, and this one is very possibly my favorite. It combines a great color scheme with a great design and produces an amazing fortress that looks great on display and is great for play. If you can find it at a decent price (It's only about $30 over RRP on bricklink), I highly recommend it.</div>",TRUE,5,3,4,5,5
"Hashem1983","2014-12-11T20:43:20.917Z","Best Living Birthday Present Today!! A Timeless Masterpiece!!  ","<p>Castle was one of&nbsp;my favorite&nbsp;Lego themes when I was a child. I was born in the early 80s so I can say I love the 80s &amp; early 90s Lego sets, and though some castles had&nbsp;the &nbsp;same idea, 2 towers in the back and the main gate in the front, I remember this one was my favorite because it has a full green base.</p>

<p><br />
Going to the toy store with my dad knowing what set I really want for my 7th Birthday, I was disappointed I didn&#39;t find it, there were only the forestmen sets, but then I looked up and there it is, the last box of the 6085 on the top shelf.<br />
What&#39;s not to like about? you get 4 horses and not like nowadays only 1!!! 12 minifigs, lots of weapons and shields. I even love my towers because I think they were the first to be almost round shaped towers.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Honestly, my dad built the castle and my sister continued on building it the next day, but I remember rebuilding it after it was torn apart, I cannot remember, but I had everything under control, my only mistake was in the technic pins, yet&nbsp;it is still really fun to build afterwards, I never get bored when I have to take it apart to clean it and rebuild the set again, I always enjoy it.</li>
	<li>As for the box, Best boxes ever, though my mom threw it away, but that time big sets had a flipped cover to see the inside of the box and a tray, and not like these days, also there are pictures of alternate buildings and good luck trying to build&nbsp;one of those.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Parts</h3>

<p>As a kid, I felt like I almost got every kind of parts that I could imagine:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I loved the wall panels with the window that had the ancient feel of a castle, especially the two printed ones those were my favorite.</li>
	<li>The Cornered wall panels, the slope&nbsp;parts with the mixture of black &amp; grey that gave the castle some style and a beautiful architect design especially at the back towers.</li>
	<li>Using the hinges to open up the castle, these small parts are the reason to give this castle a beautiful shape once you open it.</li>
	<li>The jail part was nice, though I didn&#39;t have any prisoners, but it has a very decent size.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">Having 12&nbsp;</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">minifigures</span><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">&nbsp;is more than super perfect.</span>&nbsp;This was my first castle set, I don&#39;t know how it was before.</p>

<ul>
	<li>For the archers Blue Torsos and Red for the&nbsp;soldiers with what I guess it looks like a chain wear, it was nice rather than having the logo printed on the torso.</li>
	<li>The knights were nice for my time, though I hoped they had a much more heavy armor, not that I don&#39;t like it, but for their helmets I thought they were the kinds that open.</li>
</ul>

<h3><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">The build</span></h3>

<ul>
	<li>Fun, but maybe because of its age some of the pieces are getting loose in some places</li>
	<li>Usually it used to take me two days to finish it, now I can finish it in 1 hour and so after separating the parts into two sections, the back side&nbsp;and the front side separately.</li>
	<li>It really has a beautiful structure especially at the bottom of the towers.</li>
	<li>I hoped for the draw bridge to have a different technique while lowering and pulling it up but I created my own way. The downside of it that when you pull it up too hard the draw bridge gets unattached from the technic bricks on the bottom and its very hard to put it back</li>
	<li>The&nbsp;portcullis used to be built, it doesn&#39;t have any special mechanism.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A Timeless masterpiece, a beautiful structure, my favorite was the towers structure how its held up, I love every corner it,&nbsp;even in the back, I liked using the 1X4 curved bricks that gave this castle a great look and not just a plain look.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">My only and favorite castle,&nbsp;and though I hoped for another castle like the 6086 because of its&nbsp;base plate, but I am really happy of what I have.</span></p>

<p><span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">If you stored this set for years (Even over a hundred) and took it out of its storage area and put it together and display it, it will never loose its style.</span></p>

<p><br />
<span style=""color: rgb(68, 68, 68); font-family: 'Noto Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 16px;"">This is a great set, when I saw it I did not think about color or size, I saw the towers and the horses and it was a very big set to me so I should be grateful of what I have</span><br />

"hashem_1983","2015-12-30T10:02:38.517Z","Beauty From Every Angle","<p>This set is one of the only big sets that I own and the only castle set, I got it on my 7th Birthday, and for a kid at that time, I felt like I owned everything, the set has a total of 12 minifiguers, four horses and tons of weapons.</p>

<p><span style=""font-family: 'Museo Slab', Rockwell, Courier, sans-serif; font-size: 20px; letter-spacing: -0.75px;"">Box/Instructions</span></p>

<p>Back in the day, the castle theme sets were on a yellow boxes, plus the medium and large sets has a flipped cover and have alternate builds on the box, sadly the box has been thrown away.</p>

<p>As for the instructions, it was easy to follow and not boring.</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>The Parts are great, lots of black and grey colors, you get the castle walls&nbsp;two of them has different printing (NO STICKERS) the corner panels with only one of them printed, slope pieces, arcs, plates, hinging bricks, round corner bricks, normal bricks, a few technic bricks,&nbsp;clips for holding weapons, plates and a barrel, not to forget the jail frame and door, and I guess there are a few more.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>4 Archers: wearing blue chainmail&nbsp;torso with black arms and red legs, they are all&nbsp;wearing a chin protector helmet, all of them has a quiver and a crossbow.</p>

<p>4 Soldiers:&nbsp;wearing red chainmail&nbsp;torso with black arms and blue legs, they are all&nbsp;wearing a nose and neck black helmet, 2 of them are holding an ax and the other two with spears, with the possibilities to change the weapons plus they are holding a shield with the Black Monarch&#39;s symbol.</p>

<p>4 Knights: they all have the same torso&nbsp;printing&nbsp;but have different coloring and only the black knight has a black knight helmet as the rest are in dark grey color, but these helmets visor does not open :(</p>

<ul>
	<li>The black knight with the red cape and plume (The most unique knight) on the Black horse with the blue and black&nbsp;barding</li>
	<li>A knight with a red torso, blue legs,&nbsp;and yellow plume on the white horse with&nbsp;red and blue barding.</li>
	<li>A knight with a blue torso, black arms and res legs with red plumes, with a blue saddle on a brown horse.</li>
	<li>Finally the knight with a blue torso, red arms and blue legs with yellow plumes, with a red saddle on a brown horse</li>
</ul>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>As per the instruction, you start with the back of the castle and then you start building the front gate, plus this is the last castle that the portcullis is&nbsp;built with plates,&nbsp;I did have&nbsp;some help with my dad but in general it was a fun build and never boring, even after building the set over and over over the passing years or even when I take the set apart for cleaning I never get bored, all in all fun every time and in every corner.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>A beauty from every angle, even the back side of the castle which might be the most plain side of the castle but not boring, the constructions of the back towers from the bottom to the top&nbsp;a piece of art, the front gate is unique in this set as you could go from side to side with nothing blocking the way, and with the hinges on the sides of the castle gives you a new different shape once you open it, its never a boring set, still standing proudly on my shelf, however the draw bridge could de-atatch&nbsp;from the bottom and sometimes the flag poles gets knocked off easily if you are not careful, these are&nbsp;my most downsides of the set.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>One of Lego&#39;s masterpiece designs, I like&nbsp;to look at it from every angle as its never boring, that&#39;s all I could say to this set, or perhaps I cannot find a proper word to describe its beauty rather than a timeless set that its beauty will never fade away.</p>

<p>I have lost few pieces and lots of weapons but managed to replace the lost pieces with the new ones and I had to buy new accessories from ebay&nbsp;including the shields as only one has survived to this day, a ladder could be added to this set and a treasure chest as well, or even you can build your own, its fun to add your personal touches to any Lego set, makes it more unique and special.</p>

<p>If you came across it second with a reasonable price, buy it and don&#39;t hesitate even if its missing few pieces as it could be solved. Its a great theme and a great set, the Black Knights do have a sense of style, in all of their sets in general.</p>
