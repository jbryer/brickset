Also the copter is pretty lame. The lack of minifigs ain't any better. bought this cause it was cheaper than night lord's castle, mow i feel like i've wasted money instead.",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-11T00:52:14Z","A set to regret buying! ","I also regretted buying this set, but I at least bought it at below half retail price.  On the plus side, it wouldn't be so expensive if it didn't have so many castle parts, and the figures could be worse.  

In the end, I ended up selling this set for spare parts.  The alternative designs on the box were just miserable. ",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"StormSworder","2008-12-28T22:19:27.373Z","I'll get you, my not-very-pretty, and your little spiders too.","When Lego castle first took off, I used to draw pictures of Lego sets with wizards, witches, crystal balls and the like.  Maybe I hoped one day Lego would release sets like that.  So it was a shame that when Lego Castle did start to delve into dark fantasy, they sets had become over-juniorised.  This set has far too many big pieces, which means alternative building is very difficult.  Indeed, putting together an over-simplified main model is an unrewarding experience.  The witch's flying vessel is great, a kind of mystical/medieval helicopter.  But the building is very poor.  What's the point of having a trap to crush intruders who attempt to enter through the main door if they can just walk in through the gaps in the walls?  The room with the potions, spells, crystal ball etc is far too open and exposed.  If you really want a lego witch you'd be better off with one of the smaller sets in this subtheme.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-07-16T05:54:16.137Z","Hubble Bubble","At first glance, this set looks horrible.  The use of BURPs, the mismatch of black and light and dark grey just makes it look bad.  The &quot;manor&quot; or castle doesn't even seem to be visible behind the aweful choice of colour and bricks used to build it.  There are a few redeeming spots - the &quot;drawbridge&quot; is a &quot;hill&quot; that can be raised and lowered on a chain, the skeleton and the revolving wall, the dragon, the knight and the quirky witch aircraft powered by the broomstick.  What's also interesting is a &quot;witch's study&quot; complete with crystal ball and spell on the upper left corner of the &quot;castle&quot;.  The dark forest figure lends a lot more play value to it.  It's not too bad a set, eventhough it looks really horrible.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"legolander","2007-05-18T03:43:48.01Z","Brilliant!","From what I have read, a lot of reviewers hate this set. Well, I don't relly hate it, since this was my biggest Fright Knights set. The boulder gate is good and so are the minifigs. This set has  a lot of mountains and it also has a fair amount of accessories like the crystal balls, the potions, the spell book, the silver chrome sword and other weapons. There's also a dragon, a horse, and a skeleton. The &quot;helicopter&quot; is also nice. I give this set 4/5 stars!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Kiiranaux","2007-07-26T18:20:43.067Z","Great set for fright knights.","I believe this set has alot of playability for many reasons. There are a lot of good pieces, and it comes with a good amount of minifigs.

Pros: Witch
      Dragon
      Witch's Study
      Other Figures

Cons: Gaping Hole in the walls
      Bad color scheme

If you rearrange the pieces to cover the hole, you have a smaller set, but the witch has better defense.

                            THE GOOD THINGS things are the helicopter is really cool and easy to function. and it comes with really cool minifigs and a  dragon and a cool trap that is very strong and a room for the wicth it has potions and a crystal ball and a flying broom, magic spell book. also its pretty big for a set with only 211 pieces, it has a trick room if  go in there is a revolving door with a skeleton to scare out indruders if there not already crushed by the trap.
really cool
 good outpost if you fill in the cracks. alot of good accesories wicth include  a plume really cool armour,like bat sheilds and good weapons like a chrome sword and cool helmets like bullet helmets and a dragon full helm and a wizard hat. bow and arrow and a quiver the witch has a cool spider cape. it comes with cool bodies. it  also comes with a forestman.


                                  THE BAD THINGS  are that if the any enemys wanted to come into the manor why go throught the trap hall why not go through the big gaps in the wall! [ but if you have extra pices to fill out the holes its much cooler]. 

                                    not a bad set to have if ur a collecter like me.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"AETerry","2012-03-01T16:28:39.003Z","Witch's Magic Manor Review","<p>It's been years since this set first came out and I know I picked it up as part of a ""LEGO put out dragons!"" And there were now Wizards and Witches that could be gotten in various Castle sets. So that made the biggest draw and appeal of this set, to get the Witch, Dragon and fill out a Fright Knight army with those cool looking Bat symbol sheilds.</p><p>However, years later now when I've rebuilt this set, I'm looking at the name and looking at the set in a new light and I have to wonder how LEGO could justify calling this set a Manor.<br></p>
<h4>Instructions</h4><p>The instructions are in a large booklet form with step-by-step illustrations. Due to the use of dark grey, grey and black, it's easier to follow in this set when and where to use each piece. Not like other sets where it can get confusing as to what color is being called for.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>There's 250 sets, which at $44 roughly for it's original sale, is a decent size set. There's a green dragon and horse, plus all the minifigures. There's a wide assortment of black, dark grey and grey pieces for trying to convey a mountain setting. There are also several large wall or ""mountain wall"" pieces that make up this set, thus cutting down on a large number of bricks to give the texture for a mountain setting.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>There's a total of 6 minifigures in this set. Most notable are the Witch, Dark Forest figure, skeleton and three Fright Knight soldiers, one on horseback, infantry and archer.<br></p>
<h4>The build and completed model</h4><p>There's several good ideas within this set, but I can't help but feel the execution of the design isn't that well done.</p><p>You have what appears to be the main entrance where a giant rock comes down to capture the lone Dark Forest minifigure. There's a jail of sorts to hold him. Further inside is a rotating wall with a fireplace on one side and skeleton on the other. Above that is where the Witch has her magical laboratory and study at with a place even above that for landing her helicopter type vehicle.</p><p>The Helicopter type vehicle that the witch rides on isn't too bad and functions with being able to spin the black rotor wings around.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>In the end, calling this a Manor is very much so a misnaming of this set. I wouldn't even call it a Fortress or Stronghold given some large gaps in the walls of the place, unless one took into account the possibilities of magical protection and traps not conveyed with the bricks.</p><p>For a random Mountain Setting, there's a lot of decent detail and attempts at coloring or texture with various pieces. It still isn't all that great though and has a feeling of falling flat of expectations if still thought to be a Manor.</p><p>I'm still happy with the set, I think I'd still pick it up again on any kind of a redo as there were various elements and figures from this set that I wanted.<br></p>",TRUE,4,5,4,4,4
"timberalex25","2016-01-06T03:07:17.293Z","Not so bad when put in perspective","<p>So, I&#39;ve had this set for a while. &nbsp;Bought it used on bricklink for around $40 in January 2015. I always really loved the Fright Knights theme as a kid (as much as I prefered Vader over Luke and grew into a heavy metal fan, it&#39;s all about the scary stuff!), but I only got one set when I was younger.</p>

<p>As an adult collector, I see sets as they are: their price value vs. perceived value, their aesthetic, their function, everything. That said, as some of the negative reviews on here make me sad, I must make the point to anyone that this set was created for children, not adults.&nbsp;To restate, I never had this as a kid, but I could only imagine how much fun it would have been.&nbsp;As an adult, however, I will get into my actual thoughts coming up.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>I received this set in good used condition with an excellent set of instructions, but it did not include the box.&nbsp;The instruction book has 27 pages.&nbsp;It is 11 steps to complete Willa&#39;s little flying helicopter machine and 27 steps to complete the structure. The last page of the instructions illustrates the little traps/features of the set. The front&nbsp;cover&nbsp;of course has the picture of the set, and the back cover has a picture of the dragon (with black wings) on one cliff, standing across from the knight with the chrome sword on a horse on another cliff.</p>

<p>One interesting point I feel I should mention in this review is that on the top right page of the last page, it shows what looks like a Dragon Knights&#39; emblem. This is, from what I&#39;ve seen, the second FK set with another emblem&nbsp;on their instructions (6097 has the Royal Knights&#39; symbol on the instructions)</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>I&#39;m actually reviewing this set because I just rebuilt it after deconstructing a MOC I had made from each and every piece of this set. The pieces in this set are generally very basic, containing lots of 1x1, 1x2, and 1x4 light grey bricks, five or six BURPs, and lots of arches. These make it a great set to build an MOC castle fortress with. It also contains a lot of slope pieces, a rotating wall panel/frame, a chain (you can never have enough Lego chains, in my experience), and nice fantasy pieces like (two) crystal balls, two broomsticks (obviously for magical purposes),&nbsp;magic scroll, and dragon wings. TLC loaded a lot of neat/useful pieces into this set, so 5/5 for parts.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>In this set, you get six minifigs and a big green dragon. I&#39;ve gotta say that, while the minifig count sounds good, I feel as though the figures included are lacking. I&#39;ll cover them all individually here:</p>

<p>Willa (the witch) - despite being desensitized by how many WTW minifigs I have accrued, she is a truly magical figure (pun intended). She looks exactly exactly how you would picture a malevolent witch: black sorcerer&#39;s hat, black dress, red accents, big red necklace, and a cape with a spider on it... well, maybe you don&#39;t always picture the cape, but you get the point. I also enjoy the decoration on her face, with the icky tooth and the raggedy-looking hair.</p>

<p>&quot;Black Knight&quot; - obviously not the same as one of the actual Black Knight&#39;s knights, however he is slightly similar. With his black torso, dark grey legs, and dragon helmet,&nbsp;along with the chrome sword and big bat shield, he is a truly cool, good-looking, valuable addition to this set. His appearance is always welcome in my opinion, as I think of this as one of the best knight minifigures that TLC has ever come out with.</p>

<p>Archer - this is the figure with the red arms, light grey torso, and bullet-shaped helmet. He is nothing special to me, just another castle soldier. You can never have too many of these guys, but his appearance doesn&#39;t necessarily add to the set other than just taking up space.</p>

<p>Foot soldier - this is the guy with the dark grey torso and red legs. Again, he&#39;s just another standard FK soldier. I can say the same thing about him as I did with the archer: they&#39;re kind of disposable, in a sense. It does annoy me in this set, however, that he isn&#39;t given a proper weapon. He is given a shield and a flag. I guess you can take the Dark Forestman&#39;s&nbsp;spear, but then he&#39;s a pointless, unarmed&nbsp;intruder...</p>

<p>Dark Forest Guy - I think he was an EXCELLENT addition to this set. He gives the set a good bit more playability, as none of the traps would have a purpose if not for an intruder. I do wish he would have come with a Dark Forest shield as well to make his survival a little more feasible against the FK army, but regardless, he is a good addition to this set.</p>

<p>Skeleton - technically counts towards the minifigure count in this set. Not much to say, just your classic, swingy-armed, smiling white skeleton. Adds to the &quot;creepy&quot; feel of the set and adds to the look, but doesn&#39;t contribute much.</p>

<p>Dragon - not sure if it can be considered a &quot;minifigure&quot;, but you can never have too many dragons! I usually have Willa ride this when she&#39;s trying to save on gas for the flying machine.</p>

<p>Overall, I give the minifigures&nbsp;4/5, just because Willa and the knight are awesome.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>The build for this set is really fun. It&#39;s not hard, but it is similar to sets from the 80&#39;s/early 90&#39;s where you have to pay close attention to when and where pieces are supposed to go on. The build took me about 30 minutes, with a few short breaks to send a message or two. I like how the entrance is built progressively over time. It&#39;s fun seeing the build progress. 5/5 for building</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>The completed model looks nice to me. I agree with some of the complaints about this set being too open around the edges, but I agree with that complaint from the standpoint of kids wanting to play with the set. As is, my hands are almost too big to really fiddle around with putting minifigs on the inside of the set. If it were closed off any more, it probably wouldn&#39;t be possible. The traps are neat, too. I like the falling stone entrance, and I&#39;m a fan of the jail, as a traditional jail would have taken up too much room.</p>

<p>Willa&#39;s little flying craft is pretty neat, too. I like being able to spin the wings with the little wheel instead of having to push the wings, which knocks them out of place (which I am picky about). They also did a good job of designing it so that it can land on top of the structure. Overall 4/5, losing a point because I think it would look better with bigger or more walls around the sides.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>Overall, I give this set a 5/5. While I think that $40 is a bit expensive for this (was then and is now), I do not feel as though the price, the&nbsp;slight design flaws, or the&nbsp;presence of a few lackluckster minifigures&nbsp;outweigh the overall let. I think it looks like what it was meant to be, which is a thrown-together (or perhaps destroyed) fortress/structure of some sort, much like the Dragon Knights&#39; Dark Dragon&#39;s Den. 6087 features a lot of fun little things which I can only imagine would be great for kids to play with. It also looks GREAT when put next to/combined with 6097 Night Lord&#39;s Castle. I wish they would have actually made it so they could connect via technic pin the way they did with old castle sets.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading my review! It was my first ever, so I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll get better :)</p>
