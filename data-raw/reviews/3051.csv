"Novelty","2007-08-20T07:57:30.207Z","Okinawa","A BURP is a Big Ugly Rock Piece... and there are quite a number of BURPs in this set.  The set also adds in the wooden wall pieces and a large amount of greenery.  The end result is that the fortress seems rather symmetrical and man-made when the intention is presumably supposed to be more organic in nature (pun not intended, e.g. forestmen sets).  Again the door is weak - it would have been better if it was a rock that could have been rolled away.  The &quot;action feature&quot; with the turning knob is interesting for the first time, but there are better uses for it than in this set.  The catapault thing also seems rather distorted, thanks to the hidden chamber beneath it - why would anyone want to hide weapons inside a weapon of war?  The flyer again seems to have a raft on his back as is common with most Ninja sets instead of something slick and lightweight.  Overall the colours didn't clash too badly (although red and green on grey and brown is weird), but the design didn't live up to its potential.  This is the worse big Ninja set of 1998.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"WiseWarrior","2008-10-31T19:38:52.967Z","3rd time's the charm...right?","This was my 3rd Ninja Fortress, and by looking at the picture it looked very cool. After picking it up I was pleasantly surprised by it, though it isn't without faults. Like the poster above me mentioned, this does have some BURPS, and they do stick out. This make looks a lot like a mountain hideout, and while that may be what Lego planned, I can't say it looks all that great.

It does have a lot going for it though, and one of the best features are the 2 doors, which open and close easily, and make playing with this set a blast. The winged ninja and the vines to climb down, along with countless other features make this a great set; if only there were less BURPS.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MEGADETH","2010-03-24T07:18:46.217Z","Solid set","A great medium ninja set, it has a huge trap behind the door, the minifigs are great... you get 2 black ninjas + 2 normal soldiers.<br><br>The main thing that I like from this set is the building design.<br><br>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-04T10:35:02.657Z","LEGO Castle (Ninja) - Robber's Retreat Review","This set is one of the coolest LEGO Castle (Ninja) sets which I've got. It has lot's of play value like falling swords if you pull the lever on the one side. One the top you get a jail where you can capture the blue ninja swordsman who comes with a gray helmet, black pants and an armor. We also get opening doors, a cool flag, a blacksmith's shop where you can hide some gold as well. This set also comes with a glider for the ninja with some big fins and a handle where the minifigs can hold the glider. We get two black ninjas with this set and you also get a red ninja swordsman with a black helmet, black pants, black sideburns and a green vest. We also get a catapult which the blue ninja swordsman is using to attack the building.<br><br>I really like the play features and the value for minifigs and it's a great addition to your LEGO collection for sure. The built is long but it's fun. The set is very sturdy and we also get no stickers which you have to put on.<br><br>All
in all this set is a great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
