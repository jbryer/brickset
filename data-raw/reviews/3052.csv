"A_Brickset_user","2003-07-30T00:00:00Z","","This was a great a addition to my Ninja collection. I especially like the origanality of the roof (that the grey ninja is hanging under.) There are two trapdoors in this set. One, which is not the normal type, but rather much larger, a 6x8 plat which tips, not swings, tips, so that most falls downward towards the abyss, but a bit goes upwards, which is more interesting than a single overgrown plank just falling downwards. But there is one of those (normal, two piece trapdoors) in the passage under the tower. Two revolving doors, as well as falling axes, grace this set also. I think five minifigs was reasonable for a set of this size.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

and silicy dicy!The lance the grey ninja hangs on is cool, but when you pull the rod it doesn't fall!Like I said, the idea is cool,but if you show a function,make it work!But it dosen't affect the play value of this set.Look at the vine on the tower!Put the daimiyo up there,then have the ninjas climb up the vine and slice him up!This set is one of the best.Re-release this set!It's a crime not to!!!

This is clearly one of the best!  I usually go with the ninja side rather than the samurai!  This bridge covers either a river or deep canyon.  It has two trap doors on it.  It is very cool to put above a narrrow (NARROW) crack in the ground and make it an actual bridge! Some adventures that'll bring!  You get the gray ninja and the black ninja and two samurai guardmen! The weapons are nice, especially the ninja slings!  You can attach the sword to the back of the ninja's head cover!  The bridge uses nice pieces and it uses a huge baseplate for the trap door! A defanite awesome set.

"Novelty","2007-07-18T11:01:37.06Z","Kitakyushu","This is a bridge that's been copied from may other previous bridges.  At first glance this does not appear to be another bridge.  That's because of all the architectural details that's been incorporated.  The masterful use of large bricks and BURPs gives this set the size it needs, yet small details such as the handrails and the roof tiles on the smaller tower gives this set its charm.  There are a number of play features in this set including the ninja that drops from the smaller tower, the green &quot;vine&quot;, the trapdoor on the main tower to drop stones.  An added plus is that the parts of the bridge are modular so that the bridge can be extended if needed.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-28T03:12:36.57Z","LEGO Castle (Ninja) - Stone Tower Bridge Review","This bridge looks cool and it's epic as well. There're lot's of play features and we also get a nice value for minifigs. This set will take you a while when you build that but it's lot's of fun! We also don't get any stickers which is really nice about this set. It also comes with some cool flags and a wagon which has a treasure chest on it. The platform where the evil swordsman sits on can be opened if you want to hide a katana. On the bridge we get a floor which can be opened to hide some minifigs if you want. The only problem with that feature is that the figures are hard to get out of there. You'll also get a lever which you can use to drop two big axes and a staff where the ninja can hide on the other side.<br><br>The platform in the middle can be tipped over if you move the lever if you want to make the bad guys fall in the ground. I also like the sviwel windows and the fish statues on the top of the bridge. This set also comes with a black ninja, a gray ninja, a good ninja swordsman, a bad ninja swordsman and a ninja king. It's a cool set and I think it's worth the money for sure.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"vith","2011-04-22T09:43:03.207Z","Pretty good","Just dug this set out of the attic and after completion I noticed that I had two pieces missing, the two final pieces of the roof of the tower. Anyway, it's a good set. The traps are nice (there are three!), the size is good, the minifigs are great too. The vine makes a quite interesting game-play piece and the horse-pulled cart is another fun addition. <br><br>Too bad they only gave us one printed wall piece, why is that, I wonder. The flags are nice too, they kinda ""click"" when you bend them, a nice feeling. <br><br>All in all I would say the price of 50 EUR (2000 BEF back in the days when I bought the set) was right for this one. <br>",TRUE,4,4,4,5,4
