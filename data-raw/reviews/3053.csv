Two drawbridges, a fair amount of kinghts, trap doors and a nice foreboding design.  The main problems to the set include the lack of defensive walls, the door for the ghost which goes to nowhere and the lack of a decent jail.

It also has a jail, a well or something like it, three towers, a gate, two big doors, a catupult, which is a cool design, it uses a frying pan and a couple of other commonly used pieces. Also this set comes with a unique land piece and enough weapons so everyone can have two. This set also comes with a hidden stair-case and a trap door so if the king is not pleased with someone you just pull the pin and down he goes! Also this set a rotating thing with two crossbows on it. Towards the front, there are a set of slightly smaller doors that when you open them a ghost pops out. Also, there are a couple of moving shafts in the back, and one has a string in it. Pull the string and a skeleton that is attached to it will pop up, but sometimes it will fall off.

There's tons of minifigures here, ghost, skeleton, the king, 2 generals and alot of soldiers. 

There's 2 main gates on this castle, the first one is the big front gates and the second one is on the right side of the castle. In front of the castle there's a trap door with ghost inside. Inside the castle there's a well, prison, trap floor with skeleton pop up. At the back of the castle there's another 2 trap window. What makes this castle even better is that there's a floor everywhere rounding the castle so you can put a guard almost in anywhere. There's a hidden treasure on the very top of the right tower and also a ladder on the left side of the right gate which lead to a secret floor that can be push from below.

"StormSworder","2011-01-16T04:20:23.513Z","Looks nice, but far too flimsy.","<p>After 1995 there were no more non-fantasy straight-laced castles for five years, and I can't help thinking this set was the reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The raised baseplates were an issue with some people, but personally I think a set built onto one can still be good.&nbsp; This castle looks great from the front, and indeed its tower and drawbridge and impressive.&nbsp; But when you build it you realise there really isn't very much else to it.&nbsp; There are the usual battlements and walls,&nbsp;along with&nbsp;another tower containing the throne room.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where it all falls down (literallty) is where detail and a stable structure have been sacrificed for stupid gimmicks.&nbsp; Like the trap in the throne room.&nbsp; Not only does this mean the interior of the room is taken up by the collapsing floor, but the tower is built on pillars rather than walls.&nbsp; No matter what I did I couldn't make the pillars stay in place.&nbsp; In the end I had to just ""rest"" the throne room on the pillars.&nbsp; Hardly very satisfactory.&nbsp; One tap and it will all come tumbling down.&nbsp; The front of the main tower started coming apart as well.</p>

"Novelty","2007-05-18T09:56:56.557Z","Castle fit for a King","This set is big, and it does that thanks to the large prefabricated pieces to construct a castle fit for a king.  It combines elements from a number of previous castles to give it that eclectic look, and that's where it fails some as the finished product doesn't look as polished as the previous castles.

The drawbridge has been moved to the back which is good as it means the back door can be well defended, but the front door is now basically two large doors and a single piece portacullis, which is a disappointment.

The towers are great, with storage space under the eaves of the taller tower and of course the main gate tower looks great with the printed bricks.  However, each tower could definately use a few ladders to access them.

There's a large amount of minifigs including a skeleton and a glow in the dark ghost, and the obligatory catapault built into the castle.  For all its grandeur though, it does not live up to its potential.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Smallsam99","2008-03-21T11:21:56.793Z","Truley a milestone...","This set shows off what lego really is and marks the end to lego's great era of imagination. What ever happened to lego's creativity after this theme? This castle with a ghost, bridge, and many soldiers shows off the fun that can be had with a set like this. It has no flaws and is truley memorable! I mean lego now in days has castle looking like a fake cheap fanatasy wanabe of the old castle. Lego I believe can only get back to these great sets if they change from making money to truely working on a theme and set long enough to make it perfect exactly like the 90's. I believe many are underating sets now and make the old look like they stink and give all the credit to the new stupid sets! When will we get back to good ol' days and really make a nice set that can be enjoyed for years like this one. This really is the ending and crumble of lego's creativeity, imagination, and thinking beyond what is really out there.

"sudorum","2009-12-28T18:29:57.013Z","Royal Indeed","Why can't modern lego castles be like this? The set has a rare base and a detailed inside, two aspects which modern castles lack. The front of the castle has a closet that hides a ghost. The entrance to the castle is reinforced by doors and a gate. There is also a catapult guarding the castle. The interior is by far the best. It has a well with ""water"" in it, a dungeon that lies underneath the floor, and a flip-up floor with a skeleton hiding under it. Ingenious. The second tower is the king's quarters, which contains a throne and a trap door. The very top of the tower has an attic which can be used to stash stuff in. There are also two other entrances to the castle. These include a lowering ramp and a secret staircase to the side. My only complaint is the use of string which was used way too much.

"OWF","2008-09-03T16:45:55.733Z","Good for any collection","After 13 years of release I bought this set. I wanted it because as far as I know this is the biggest castle ever made. It's not a set to discover more and more when you build it, but at the end it's good.

Qualities:
Lots of minifigs, a total of 11
The only castle who has Skeleton and Ghost, both together.
3 horses, 1 of each color.
2 gates, and lots of traps.

Disadvantages:
All minifigs from Royal Knights looks like clowns.
The King looks also like a clown, Red&amp;White is the most baddest combination for a regal wearing.
There's no queen.
No enemy minifig.

The set also includes a unique 32 X 48 baseplate which I believe was only available with this set and never used again, and it's a really good baseplate.  Two cloth flags and a cloth cape for the king area also included, along with five large corner wall panels with windows cut in them.

I bought this set only a few days ago since I missed out on it back when it was out, and really enjoy it - it's definitely worth up to $300 USD if new and in a sealed box.

"BobaFett2","2011-01-12T17:22:43.103Z","It's....magnificient.","<p>I received this set close-to-complete in a collection from my neighbor. A few bricklink purchases completed it in all but Minifigures and a few flags.<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>From the instructions, this castle has the appearance of something royal. A shining landscape surrounds it, the hills glow with the light of the sun, and soldiers and knights line the walls to defend the castle from the evil Wolfpack, Black Knights, or whatever other nemesis comes their way.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>This set has some superb parts. It has pillars-3 bricks tall, octagonal shape-in grey. They're very nice, and this is the only set in which they are this color. The set has a lot of castle wall pieces-they aren't the most elegant piece for the walls, but they certainly do work and conserve parts. And unlike many castles, LEGO makes very little use of such large parts. The set comes with a large set of double doors as well as a pair of small ones. It also comes with not one, but three sets (2 in a set) of gate ""sliders"" in grey, as well as 4 blue 1x2s with a groove for a gate/garage door in them. There are many 2x2 pyramid pieces, a very large number of arches, and MANY shields. The large diagonal castle wall piece appears in two sets-but the other one is a Castle Dacta set, which as well all know, are a bit hard to find. So they're practically exclusive to this set. Oh yeah-you also get a top-notch castle baseplate.<br></p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>You get 11 Minifigures, putting this set on the list of sets with the most figures on Brickset. Great, huh? As well as many soldiers, you get a king (the crown piece originated in this theme), 2 different knights (one has a ""vented"" single-piece helmet with plume, the other has a visor with plume). You also get some supernatural minifigures, them being a ghost and a skeleton (which could also just be a dead guy-but hey-skeletons were first rejected because the designers said ""Minifigures never die"", and when they were brought in, they were almost always alive, except in pirates).<br></p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>It's fun. I was surprised by the detail in the build. There were some things I missed and had to go back for, and the build was fairly fun. I really like the use of the baseplate-it was quite awesome.<br></p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>The completed model is amazing. It rivals some of the best castles, and with good reason. Not only is there a tall gatehouse and large doors, as well as walls surrounding the castle one all side, but there is also a throne (although it's a bit puny), a little ghost hideout, an exit in the back with it's own drawbridge, yet another exit, this time secret, a jail, and many more parts. The pyramids nicely top of the castle, the battlements are well done, the flags, shields, and arches all add a bit of detail and sparkle to the whole thing, and the Minifigures finish it off nicely. The only thing that strikes me is the fact that there are weapons in places that are unreachable. But this is common in older sets.<br></p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>I highly recommend this set. Unlike a lot of old sets, this set has risen in price. It's very sad-a lot of the cheaper ones have broken baseplates, and the baseplate itself is pricey-undamaged ones start at 10 dollars on bricklink.<br></p><p>Any Castle fan, any Royal Knights fan, or just about anyone else with even a bit of interest in castle would benefit greatly from this set. I recommend it to thee, people of the brick.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"The_Dumb_One","2011-03-06T20:50:56.293Z","The vague begining","<p>This was one of the first Lego sets I ever remember getting. I was about 4 at the time but I nevertheless remember the great amusement it was to build and play with the set and the minifigs.</p>
<p>At that age, I enjoyed all the little trap doors, secret entrances, draw bridge and porticollis. There's plenty of room inside to play around with and all walls, ramparts and towers were well constructed and sturdy.</p>
<p>I'm sad to say that ever since I broke it down about 3 years ago, I've never been able to rebuilt it since I'm missing a bunch of pieces...</p>",TRUE,4,5,5,5,5
"marcus880","2011-04-10T06:29:06.633Z","Magestic. Truly fit for a king","<p>I recently snatched this beauty off ebay for a fair price of fifty pounds. And let me tell you every penny well spent!<br></p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>The set did not come with a box so I can not detail on that. The instructions were of high quality but as with all the pre 21st century sets the instructions are not quite as detailed so you have to do a bit of spot the diffrence identify what goes where.<br></p>
<h4>Parts</h4>There are many rare or useful parts in the set. There are two parts I know are exclusive- the&nbsp; fantastic base plate and the large flag. The kings cape I think maybe. There around TWENTY weapons in the set so if you feel you are short of castle weapons look no futher! There also several pieces rare or in unusal/ unique colourings. Three horses are included.<br><h4>Minifigures</h4>There are eleven minifigs in the set:<br>The king<br>The king is fantastic. He has an awsome red beared face and a surprisingly detailed torso since 1995 had not excactly the most detailed men. He has a great crown which was unique at the time though it is a castle regular now. He also has a cape but I generaly take that off.<br>Archers<br>There are two archers with plain smiley faces. Nothing intresting here though nice arrow holders and bows.<br>Spear guards.<br>Two spear guards with chain mail smiley face.<br>Moustache guards<br>Again two of moustached guards (seeing a pattern here!) with short swords.<br>Red Knight<br>There is a nice red kinght with a great helm. Still quite plain though.<br>Chain Mail knight<br>There is a knight in chain mail with a grilled helm. I really like the detail on this one and it has a captain redbeard (blackseas barracuda) Face. <br>Ghost<br>I have to confess this was my first ghost and I love him/ her! It looks fantastic when it glows in the dark and fits in with any horror, castle or halloween scene!<br><h4>The build</h4>The build is enjoybal and it is really nice to see the castle develop. As said though you have to be careful as instrucions are not as detailed as they are now.<br><h4>The completed model</h4>The completed model is simply stunning.From the fantastic use of assemetry down to little details like a well of gargoyles on the side of towers it does truly look amazing. The front gate house looks partically cool with the huge-siege withsatnding doors and portcullis. The kings tower is also great and I like the neat stroage attic. Some have mentioned how string is use alot and while tying the smallest of knots is annoying if you take time it really adds to the playability. while on that subject do not get this as a starter se for castle if you are after playability as it comes with no enemies like modern ones do so make sure you have other sets.<br><h4>Summary</h4><p>Overall this is a truly incredible set and deserves to be ranked with the lego legends (balckseas baracuda etc.) Wheather your looking for a set for display or play this really is a must and can be grabbed for a reasonble price on auction sites.<br></p>",TRUE,5,5,5,4,5
"Ernst","2013-01-27T08:14:28.5Z","Royal Knight's Castle, still one of the best if not THE best.","<p><strong>Overall 5 bricks</strong>: Hard to add something to 29 earlier reviews, but here is mine. This is in my opinion one of the best Castle&#39;s&nbsp;Lego ever made. It looks&nbsp;thanks to the blue roofs great, it looks realistic and defendable. It is very playable&nbsp;because of&nbsp; the diversity of entrances and gimmicks and has great diversity in parts and several unique ones. The only comment you may have on this set is that you miss an opposite faction. Therefor I distracted one brick for playability. A must have for a true Castle fan despite the price, if you find it I only can advise you to get it.</p>

<p><strong>Building 5 bricks</strong>: Simply great fun to built this set, the biggest difficulty is the use of the instructions. In the modern sets you get shown which bricks to use, here you have to look very good otherwise you forget parts. You sometimes have to built on several sides of the castle in the same picture&nbsp;which makes it&nbsp;harder for real young kids. Globally the sequenze of building is the rear side and bottom parts like the dungeon. The right hand Tower with drawbridge and the&nbsp;escape hatch, after that the front wall with&nbsp;entrance and left rear tower. The finishing touch is the built of the great entrance with wooden doors, hatch and on top the treasure room. All is built with a mix of small parts and several wall parts for the front and left side tower. The result is awesome with a remark for the high right hand tower that gives this Castle a real majestical look&nbsp;!</p>

<p><strong>Parts 5 bricks</strong>: This set offers several unique parts starting with the great base plate. Others are the flags and King&#39;s cape, the big <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=6055"">corner wallparts </a>and <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=6107"">facets </a>and of course the <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=2490pb03"">barding</a> of the King&#39;s horse. All great parts, too much to mention them all.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 4 bricks</strong>: Although this set offers great playability with all the entrances, traps and the presence of 11 mini figures I distracted one here. The simple reason is the lack of an opposite faction, an enemy... In set <a href=""http://brickset.com/detail/?Set=6078-1"">6078-1: Royal Drawbridge</a> we see a Dragon Knight so why not here ? With 2 less Royal Knights and 3 Dragon Knights added it would have been perfect.</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks</strong>: The average value offered in <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogPG.asp?S=6090-1"">Bricklink</a> is now some &euro;113,00 which is already &euro;30,00 more than in June 2011 when I bought this set. If you can get it for a price below the average I advise you to get it, it will only raise in price I think. I was fortunate to pay considerable less so my 5 bricks are well deserved.</p>

	<span style="""">The flagship set, the big one, the set that this &lsquo;so called&rsquo; King states his claim to royalty on, The Royal Knights Castle. And what an impressive place for a King! It is one of the Largest Castles available and was defiantly the biggest set to appear up to this point for the castle theme.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<span style="""">So many parts of this set are unique, useful or exciting, the base plate, corner walls with windows, horses barding, large flag and King&rsquo;s cape all cannot be found anywhere else (I think correct me if I am wrong).</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<span style="""">Minifigs wise the set is also brilliant you receive a pleasant and varied number of troops, no longer are the figs only distinguished by their weaponry and helms but they also receive a slightly varied torso printing (white for archers, red for swordsmen and chainmail for spearmen). Three horses is a nice start to any Calvary and the inclusion of both a ghost and skeleton makes this castle the most haunted structure to date. It should also be noted that this set is the only example of Knights for the whole of the Royal Knights theme, I am really not a fan of the red gloved one as I feel he is touching a little too close to the jelly bean knights that came later (to be reviewed later also) but I can appreciate the inclusion of both of them in this set.</span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<span style=""mso-bidi-font-family:Calibri;mso-bidi-theme-font:
minor-latin"">As for the design of the castle you can see that it is very appealing, the castle gates and portcullis are nice (though I would have liked the drawbridge at the front of the castle) and the splashes of grey offset the black nicely so that this castle look somewhat different to the Black Knights structures which also used a similar colour scheme. I am not the biggest fan of some of the gimmicks in this set, I don&rsquo;t like that the King&rsquo;s throne trap the pop up skeleton or the ugly technic catapult but these are minor quibbles to a great set. </span></p>
<p class=""MsoNormal"">
	<span style="""">Personally I see this set as one of the final greats alongside that of the Black Monarchs Castle, Forestmens Fortress and Black Falcon&rsquo;s Fortress, something any diehard fan should build at least once (and preferably own forever).</span></p>
