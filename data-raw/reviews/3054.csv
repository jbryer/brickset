","This is the largest Knights Kingdom set, and like all castle sets, it comprises of the biggest castle of the subtheme.  It appears big partially due to the fact that it sits on a raised baseplate.  It is also because of this raised baseplate that a ramp/drawbridge is required to access the castle.  Thanks to the height of the entryway, the ramp can only be so long (or short in this case) which results in a rather steep climb to the castle.

The main part of the castle consist of the throne room.  This part fo the building, and the four adjacent buildings all adhere to the standard Knights Kingdom colour scheme of grey/black walls, tan highlights and blue roofs.  The main throne room has a cloth backdrop instead of a wall, probably to reduce pieces and building time.  This gives the castle a weird look when viewed from the back.  The throne room, however looks nice from the front.  Above the throne room is a small room with a stained glass window and a balcony, and above that is a small tower and battlements.

The four buildings at the corners are not only modular, but they are interchangable as well - interchangable with each other and with the 2 buildings from 6094 - to change the look of the castle as and when required.  Three of the buildings included with this set is rather mundane - battlements, a 2 storey building with the compulsory catapault, and a 2 storey jail cell and tower.  The fourth building consists of a hidden lever with the treasure chest on top such that when the lever is depressed... say when fired upon, the treasure chests fly out of the castle.  Why anyone would place a treasure chest on the roof on the periphery of the castle is beyond comprehension.  It would have been better if it was a pile of rocks or something.

For extra play value, there's a siege machine with the spring loaded missile launcher.  Again, nothing special there.  The set is kitted out with a whole lot of minifigs, including a maiden and a skeleton.  There's still room for improvement for this set, but as it is, it works fine.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set is for kids.","<p>I bought this set a while ago because I thought it looked interesting. &nbsp;I thought it might be fun to build, and see what LEGO did during my dark ages. &nbsp;Boy was I wrong! &nbsp;This set was made for playing, not building.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions - 3/5</h3>

<p>I bought the set used, and it did not come with a box, so I have nothing to say about it. &nbsp;The instructions were adequate, with lots of illustrations. &nbsp;It also included instructions for alternate builds, which is nice.</p>

<h3>Parts - 2/5</h3>

<p>The focus of this set is clearly on getting the thing built as fast as possible, so you can get to playing. &nbsp;As such, there are a lot of big parts. &nbsp;In fact, I think that the designers used large pieces wherever possible, to avoid the possibility of someone actually putting two pieces together and enjoying it. &nbsp;So we have a lot of 1x2x5 bricks, and 1x1x5 bricks. &nbsp;The result is a tall, open design. &nbsp;This helps the playability of the set, so that kids can access the different areas. &nbsp;But it doesn&#39;t look great.</p>

<p>Then we have outdated pieces like this number:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/PL/6056.gif"" style=""height:182px; width:78px"" /></p>

<p>Personally, I&#39;m glad these pieces have fallen by the wayside. &nbsp;A useless, short-cut piece, if you ask me. &nbsp;And then there&#39;s this one:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/PL/30272.jpg?0"" style=""height:269px; width:310px"" /></p>

<p>Another useless piece. &nbsp;Dumbed down for kids to keep the piece-count down. &nbsp;I&#39;m glad these pieces have fallen by the wayside too. &nbsp;The piece is used in this set to be the main gate, and the portcullis slides through it to block entry. &nbsp;But when the portcullis is raised, it sticks right out the top! &nbsp;I don&#39;t know about you guys, but I&#39;ve never seen a castle where the portcullis sticks out the top of the gatehouse when it&#39;s raised. &nbsp;A pretty rediculous design.</p>

<p>And then, of course, we have the raised baseplate. &nbsp;I like the idea of it, and it allows the castle to end up being pretty tall. &nbsp;But the raised portion is supposed to act like a castle wall, and it doesn&#39;t quite work. &nbsp;The printed design on the sides just doesn&#39;t look like a wall - it&#39;s too green. &nbsp;If the baseplate was gray it might work better.</p>

<h3>Minifigures - 4/5</h3>

<p>Call me old-fashioned, but I like the charm of these old minifigs. &nbsp;The faces are just too cute! &nbsp;I mean, look at this:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ML/cas035.jpg?0"" style=""height:358px; width:212px"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ML/cas033.jpg?0"" style=""height:412px; width:224px"" /><img alt="""" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ML/cas041.jpg?0"" style=""height:392px; width:220px"" /></p>

<p>Now tell me those aren&#39;t cute!</p>

<p>Also, the knight errant of the castle just happens to be a woman:</p>

<p><img alt="""" src=""http://www.bricklink.com/ML/cas034.jpg?0"" style=""height:428px; width:218px"" /></p>

<p>Let it be known that the Lion king is an equal-opportunity employer!</p>

<h3>The build - 1/5</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve said it before. &nbsp;The build leaves much to be desired. &nbsp;The emphasis on this set&#39;s design was on playability, not building. &nbsp;In fact, as I was building it, one thought kept going through my mind - &quot;Was this designed by a 12 year-old?&quot; &nbsp;I seriously think it was the result of the LEGO designers&#39; &quot;bring your daughter to work day.&quot;</p>

<p>You want a tower? &nbsp;Great, just put these huge pieces together and put a top on it! &nbsp;There&#39;s your tower. &nbsp;Not much thought went into the design. &nbsp;If you have all the pieces together before you start the build, it should take maybe 20 minutes, tops.</p>

<h3>The completed model - 2/5</h3>

<p>The result of the 20 minutes of building is a rather large-looking castle. &nbsp;I say large-looking because it&#39;s all illusion. &nbsp;Everything is open. &nbsp;There are no solid walls anywhere. &nbsp;This allows you to reach into the structure and play, but it doesn&#39;t look all that great. &nbsp;Still, it&#39;s an adequate play set.</p>

<p>Speaking of playability, it has a few fun surprises. &nbsp;There&#39;s a hanging axe trap, which will chop an invader in half if he tries to grab a jewel. &nbsp;There&#39;s the requisite catapult, of which the only available ammo is a helmet-wearing skeleton. &nbsp;There&#39;s a couple secret doors, and a secret compartment under the king&#39;s throne. &nbsp;And there&#39;s a wall that collapses when shot, and propels a treasure chest off the tower, into enemy hands. &nbsp;So the playability is there. &nbsp;The &quot;buildability&quot; is not.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion - 2/5</h3>

<p>I can only give this set 2/5 overall. &nbsp;If this was the first set I built after my dark ages, I would never have gotten back into LEGO. &nbsp;I&#39;ve read all the other reviews of this set, and I cannot understand the high ratings given by some of the reviewers. &nbsp;The only explanation I can think of is that most of the reviewers are looking at this set through nostalgia. &nbsp;I do not suffer from nostalgia, since I never built this set as a child. &nbsp;So I consider my rating pretty objective. &nbsp;If you want to complete your castle collection, you have no choice but to get this set. &nbsp;And it does come with some interesting minifigs. &nbsp;But otherwise, I would pass this one by.</p>
