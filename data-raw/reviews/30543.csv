<p>Mario is an entity that I am personally not well versed in (but I have a soft spot for Mario kart on the Wii) and a fuzzy is the character I got in my mystery Mario pack series one as one of my 2020 Christmas gifts .</p>

<p>The character -</p>

<p>The character is built in a 2&times;2 rounded black plate and has snot bricks in the centre , the top and sides are an alternating pattern of tiles and 1&times;1 black pyramids on all three sides , the face is very goofy and is printed on a 2&times;2 black tile and the back is where Mario scans it with the factory applied sticker .&nbsp;</p>

<p>The stand -</p>

<p>The stand is built on a 4&times;4 light green Mario introduced plate piece , there is a post using a clear part and a hinge to place fuzzy and some hill scenery using various rounded pieces including green and teele .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a very nice set and as someone who could not care less who I got from my random pack , I am very satisfied as I just wanted a taste of this fresh new theme so I recommend it to any Lego fan because whoever you get there will be something to please you .</p>
