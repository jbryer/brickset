<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The set has only 16 parts, which is the least of the Super Mario&nbsp;character series. Half of these parts are for the terrain platform, which has 4&nbsp;fairly new <a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6273589/plate-1x1x2-3-outside-bow"">1 x 1 double curve pieces</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The buzzy beetle comprises the other half of the set. The shell and&nbsp;head both have some nice&nbsp;unique printings. Its design is identical&nbsp;to Spiny&#39;s&nbsp;with the small exception that the shell features spikes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>What I don&#39;t like is that the Lego model does not look like the in-game Buzzy beetle. The shell is too short and geometric and is out or proportion to the rest of the body. I am honestly hoping that they release another version in an upcoming set with a new mold. In addition, it is hard to see the head unless you look at ground level.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stomping on Buzzy twice yields 3 coins, after which&nbsp;he can be rescanned for a single coin. This is a nice change from the many&nbsp;&#39;one coin&#39; enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In summary,</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Has some nice parts.</li>
	<li>Above-average play function.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Low-profile and poor resemblance to the enemy in the game.</li>
	<li>Few parts (although the shell does make up for this).</li>
</ul>
