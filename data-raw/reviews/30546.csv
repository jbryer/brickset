Released in August 2020, these retail for &pound;3.49/$4.99 each and have an average of 23 pieces each. The character we will be looking at today is Bullet Bill&nbsp;who has 24&nbsp;pieces giving a price per part of 14p/20c.</p>

<p>I reviewed the 71360 Adventures with Mario already, please read that review for more on how the Mario figure works:&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/57216"">https://brickset.com/reviews/57216</a>&nbsp;. Let&#39;s take a look at this character and his features.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Character</strong></p>

<p>Bullet Bill is a unique figure to the blind bags, with a larger Boomer Bill in the Boomer Bill Barrage&nbsp;set, he uses 10 of the 24 pieces.</p>

<p>Bullet Bill is build around 4 main pieces that makes his body, two 1x2 plates with a 2x2 plate coming from one side and 2 1x2 technic bricks all in black. In the technic holes are some new for 2020 white arm pieces that has a technic pin and can move 360 degrees. On top of the technic bricks is the interactive tile, one the side plates there is an exclusively printed curved brick in black with Bills eyes on both sides, and on the back plate is a unprinted 2x2 tile. The base of Bullet Bill has a 2x2 rounded plate.</p>

<p>Now what does Bullet Bill&#39;s interactive tile do?, well when Mario jumps on Bullet Bill he will gain 1 point and that is it, unfortunately no unique sounds or coin amounts, but you can constantly jump on Bill without a limit.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>So with every single character in these blind bags you also get a small build to extend your courses with. This is great for anyone not wanting to buy any Mario sets for the builds but wants some of the new 4x4 rounded plates which Bullet Bill&nbsp;has in a yellow&nbsp;colour. Built on this plate is a fairly sized cactus build made using a few 1x1 bricks, headlight bricks with some small arch pieces with 1x1 tooth tiles on all in a green colour. There is also a small clear stand made using two 1x2x2 transparent panel pieces for Bullet Bill to stand on, this assembly is on a 2x2 round tile in yellow. Finally, there is also a small flower with a stud underneath.</p>

<p>Each blind bag also includes extra parts which is great, this set has 3&nbsp;being the 1x1 green tooth tile, 1x1 green stud and 1x1 dark pink flower studs.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I absolutely love these blind bags, they offer great value definitely compared to a minifigure blind bag which cost the same for in some cases 4x fewer parts than what these blind bags have. Bullet Bill is an epic little character build who looks amazing but the interactive feature of him is pretty disappointing because he only gets one coin and no special sound effects. I do love the scenery build, absolutely&nbsp;adore the Cactus build and overall this set is a great little pocket money to, parts pack and a decent extension to courses despite the lack of interesting interactive features.</p>

<p><strong>Pros - </strong>Great build for both scenery and Bullet Bill, cheap way to get some new and exclusive parts, price is brilliant for what you get</p>

<p><strong>Cons -</strong> Quite a disappointing interactive feature, would have liked at least a unique sound for him.</p>
