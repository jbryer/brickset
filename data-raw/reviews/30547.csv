"Minifig290","2020-08-03T15:10:56.897Z","Great way to get a cute little character","<p>Hello, today I&#39;ll be taking a look at one of the 10 LEGO Super Mario 71361 Character Packs.&nbsp;Released in August 2020, these retail for &pound;3.49/$4.99 each and have an average of 23 pieces each. The character we will be looking at today is Bob-omb who has 22 pieces giving a price per part of 15p/22c.</p>

<p>I reviewed the 71360 Adventures with Mario already, please read that review for more on how the Mario figure works:&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/57216"">https://brickset.com/reviews/57216</a>&nbsp;. Let&#39;s take a look at this character and his features.</p>

<p><strong>Character</strong></p>

<p>Now Bob-omb is the exact same as the one released in the 71362 Guarded Fortress, but that is a &pound;45 set and this is just &pound;3.49, so I&#39;m not complaining about him being the same.</p>

<p>He is built quite similar to a Goomba with two 1x2x2 bricks with studs on 3 sides in grey that has a bunch of tiles attached. He uses a 2x2 dark blue tile with some print for his eyes, a 2x2 unprinted dark blue tile on his left side, a 2x2 tile with the interactive tile for Mario to get coins with on his right side and on the back he has a 2x2 jumper plate with an awesome nw colour for the wind up piece in a dark nougat. On the top of Bob-omb he has another 2x2 jumper plate but with a 1x1 round tile with minifigure handle to hold a small flame piece. Finally, all his body is built on a pair of the new for Super Mario legs, this time 2x2 in yellow which is a fairly common colour for this part in the first wave of sets.</p>

<p>Now what does Bob-omb&#39;s interactive tile do?, well when Mario hits the tile he has to keep jumping on Bob-omb for as many times without it blowing up, the more hits you get with Mario and not being blown up you get more coins. If Bob-omb explodes Mario cannot collect coins for a few&nbsp;seconds. Mario&#39;s speakers plays some hissing sounds whiles doing this and also plays the explosion sound when the bomb inevitably explodes.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>So with every single character in these blind bags you also get a small build to extend your courses with. This is great for anyone not wanting to buy any Mario sets for the builds but wants some of the new 4x4 rounded plates which Bob-omb has in a light green colour. Built on this plate is a small hill build made using a 2x3 brick with some sloped pieces in lime green with a 1x2 jumper plate for Bob-omb to be placed on. Next to the hill is a small flower which is made just using the leaf piece in green with a pink flower on top.</p>

<p>Each blind bag also includes extra parts which is great, this set has 4 being the flame, 1x1 tile with minifigure handle, flower and nougat wind up piece.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I absolutely love these blind bags, they offer great value definitely compared to a minifigure blind bag which cost the same for in some cases 4x fewer parts than what these blind bags have. Bob-omb though not exclusive is still a great inclusion for the series and if you&#39;re a course builder this is definitely a pick up, and even if your not a course builder this is great as a display piece or for the parts he has.</p>

<p>I love the features with its interactive tile for Mario as well, might be my favourite of the series tbh.</p>

<p><strong>Pros -&nbsp;</strong>Great value for what you get, cute build, nice way to get some Mario pieces, cheap way to get a awesome character</p>

<p><strong>Cons -&nbsp;</strong>None to mention</p>
