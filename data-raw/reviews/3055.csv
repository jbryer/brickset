"A_Brickset_user","2003-06-15T00:00:00Z","","Well, first I'll go through the good to great small rare or interesting pieces in this set. Two rubies, three yellow goblets, a scroll (Majisto's kind), treasure box with some gold coins, a red mug, and six dolphin roof ornaments that double over as fish for a Pirates'/Adventurers' display. 65 black roof pieces! Yes of course I have the set, but no, I din't count them, someone on Lugnet did. I agree, it could have used another samurai. Plenty of great Ninja building accessories including ten, seven high slanted stone walls, and about thirty five of the 1x2x6 and 1x1x6 white pillars together. Also, the one of a kind mailed samurai (chane-mail in case you know it that way. Behind the door, four long grey axes are waiting for a little pin to be removed so they can come crashing down on the Bull/Longhorn robbers. Plenty of weapons, and extra weapons. There is also a jail that can easily fit three Bulls easily, andfour with hardy any squeeze. I love the design of this set 9My second favorite Ninja design, my favorite Ninja set), and I would probably buy another not becase I want to make them back to back, but my number of Bulls surpassed the eagles by an awful lot, and they took over this place and the rest of my Ninja buildings, and turned this in to a 3 foot tower, so I need a new fortress for my wandering band of 15 or so Eagles. (They were thrown out by the dragon Ninjas after a few days.)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-01-10T23:52:07Z","Best of the 90's castles ","Not counting Fort Legoredo, this has to be the best of the 90's castles.  A very unique and cool theme, excellent ninja figures, a ninja glider, a prison, and sections that lock together so you can build huge walls and bigger castles!

Disadvantages: Sadly, many of the pieces are juniorised, making this set less versatile.  the lesser amount of figures is also disappointing.  A pet hate is that it is still only a 1-sided castle on it's own, although this is offset if you buy 2 sets to build a fully 4-sided square fortress. 

I recommend this set to anyone who can afford to buy 2 of it!  It makes an inimitible tablepiece and also home for the ninjas! ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2004-11-28T13:48:04Z","A legend!","Please Lego re-release this set. It's gotta be the best set for traps ever!!! It has the trap door, falling axes, and a revolving door. Not to mention a solid castle construction and a  cool Ninja (grey) hanglider.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-03-19T13:32:33Z","The Shadow Knows...","Every collection has one set that is considered a ten... and this is it.  First of all, let me point out that this castle has tall walls on 3 of its four side and the ability to combine two of them together to make the ultimate of castle sets.  I am told it is quite a sight.  Also, let's add in some more facts: one trap floor, two flip walls, one four axe front door surprise, lots of figures, a jail, lots of inner details and different kinds of treasure... the list goes on.  My only complaint would be that more horsemen are needed, but that does fit later samurai customs (I think, don't quote me on that!!).  This set was well thought out and created.  One word of warning:  the connections between the three sections are not all that strong, so you need to be careful while moving this masterpiece around.  Either way, this is the ten set for this collection and remember... crime does not pay!!!",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-08-18T13:12:15.91Z","Tokyo","This is the huge base for the Ninja subtheme.  It is huge.  The good thing is that this hugeness isn't built up from a big baseplate, but from castle walls and slopes instead.  The building is easy as the entire set is modular.  There are 6 modules - each module can be built individually and then fitted together in a number of ways to produce a number of different layouts.  There are play features built into each of the 3 towers as well as interesting rooms therein.  The design is about par for the Ninja series, but the good use of printed bricks for the walls and the nice colour coordination makes up for this.  The door is a bit flimsy as usual, especially for such a big castle.  Also, this set is pretty much a facade, but 2 of them can be combined to form a rather grand castle.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"azoxystrobin","2008-07-15T18:23:12.013Z","It's like tenchu, in lego","Wow, this is my second ninja set, simultaneously with Shanghai suprise.

Years after they are no longer released I still managed to get one for a decent price, I think.

It is brilliant !
There are many things to do, lots of working parts and traps.
It's cleverly built too, and modular.

I may be biaised because it's my first lego castle, but so far it's the best one :)

Whereas I will complain about some sets, I can't see anything wrong with this one, it's a clever and intuitive build, it took just the right amount of time to build, for a stunning impression.
I suppose that 10 wall pieces was a bit on the easy side, but they still look good.

"andy0002","2009-03-29T20:57:01.687Z","do not own, but found  alot of the important pieces","I found a large majority of the pieces for this including everything for the towers and the two front doors. (those big rock wall things I couldn't get hold of though .. although, if you're planning to do what I did then another piece you can use is a couple of those soccer advertisement boards from 4466). Anyway, this is a great set and it is gigantic! Really colorful too. It's my favorite castle I own, even if its not official. I also recreated the hanglider using a Viking set. It's a really awesome glider and rarely ever falls apart like you'd think it would! 5/5 this set is awesome :D",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"alldarker","2009-11-25T07:58:22.123Z","Biggest of the Ninja sets","When I was younger internet wasn't as readily available as it is now. 
That fact, coupled with the fact that hardly any of the larger sets from the Ninja subline from 1998 - 1999 made their way to the shops in the Netherlands, made me unaware of this set until a couple of years ago. 
I remember when I first saw pictures of it, I wasn't that impressed. This castle looked mostly tall and thin, but not very exciting. 
Winding forwards to early 2009, I regained a new interest in the slightly obscure Lego Ninja line. 
Searching around on eBay I found out that a lot these sets aren't too expensive, and in a couple of months time I was able to buy most of the larger sets from this underrated line. 
The Ninja line is interesting as it is mostly building centered, and not, as many other Lego lines, mostly vehicle-based. The 6093 Flying Ninja Fortress is the largest set appearing in the Ninja line. It's actually more the walls of a fortress than a castle as such: apparantly, Samurai Castles in Japan often consisted of a huge keep within walls like these. The 6083 Samurai Stronghold resembles this, but might be slightly smallish. What is accurate though, are the sloped walls, which look  exactly like the walls of real Japanse Samurai castles. Some people will complain that the parts that make up teh castle walls are big and ugly, but their bulk makes an imposing wall and convey a sense of sturdiness a lot better than the standard Lego medieval castle walls. Also very nice is the coloring of this castle. The black and white main theme with red and blue details are very pleasing to the eye. 
Lastly, the set is based on combining modules. The towers can be switched around, and, more importantly, the walls can be switched to make either a relatively square and compact castle, or a very long castle wall. In either case, there is the problem that this isn't an enclosabel castle with walls on for sides. However, the setup does allow adding a second Flying Ninja Fortress to the back, creating a large enclosed castle (in fact, I have aquired a second Fortress for just this purpose. 
As for play features, they are good. Amongst the features 
are a large prison cell, drop-down axes in the front gates, a flip-around wall with a skeleton behind it and a bedroom for the Daimyo. Included with the set are also a (slightly large and bulky) glider and a horse. 
The set contains 8 minifigs (or 9 if you include the skeleton). I am always slightly confused about the factions in the Ninja line. It seems that ninja's were often in the service of the feudal lords (Daimyo's) and carried out the dirtier jobs like assassination and spying, whereas the Samurai (also in service with the Daimyo's) prefered honorable, clean and open combat. 
In this set you get the Samurai warrior and his three soldiers, but you also have three Ninja's (two grey, one black) and one robber. It seems everyone looks angry, making it harder to select a 'good' faction or an 'evil' faction in this line: especially the affiliation of the ninja's is slightly vague. I guess this does make using you imagination to select affiliations more interesting than other common 'good guys vs. bad guys' Lego themes. 
All in all, this set is excellent and highly recommended. ",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-08-21T05:37:37.39Z","LEGO Castle (Ninja) - Flying Ninja Fortress Review","This is my biggest and one of my favourite LEGO Castle (Ninja) sets I've got. This fortress is huge and has a boatload of play features. I also can't complain about the value for minifigs.&nbsp; I think younger kids will need some help of their parents to put this set together. I also like the nice wall pieces on the front of this fortress. There're no stickers on those pieces. In fact: we get no stickers in this set. We can also find lot's of flags which makes this set looking cooler and two big doors in the front which you can open. This set also includes a jail for the bad guys which has a coffee mug in it. We also get a place where the blacksmith can produce the swords.<br><br>If you want to enter the fortress you have to be careful because there're 4 big axes on the top which you can use to kill the enemy which is really awsome. You'll also get 3 different towers in this castle. The one on the middle has nothing special in there. The tower which you can see on the left has a treasure chest on the top and on the bottom you can see a wall which you can swivel. The last tower comes with a floor which can disappear and a bed on the top.<br><br>This is not all we get here. We get a flying ninja as well and a horse for the ninja king. The 9 minifigs which are included in this set are 1 black ninja, 2 gray ninjas, 1 skeleton, 1 robber, 1 ninja king and 3 ninja swordsmen. I really can't complain about this model and I think this set is a must have for all LEGO collectors.<br><br>All

this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.

"Ernst","2012-01-22T11:00:30.553Z","The Flying Ninja Fortess, simply GREAT !","<p>Overall 5 bricks: This is a great set, great to built,&nbsp;to play with and great to just show it. Definitly the major set of the theme,&nbsp;colourfull with great traps and accesoires and 9 minifigures.&nbsp;Also useable with other themes like&nbsp;Pirates (as enemy)&nbsp;and of course the successor theme Ninjago.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 5 bricks:&nbsp;Building is a load of fun, not really for the smallest fans. I think a minimum age 6/7 years is advised for this set. First you start with the minifigures with the awesome hangglider, nice and stable. Than the building of the fortress can start, you have to build it stages. First the 3 towers with both small parts and great looking white walls. The roofs are made of broad and small slopes and make it strong. For the ceilings the massive plates are used which also improves stabilty. For an older fan not very difficult but you have to keep focused. When finished the 3 towers you start with the 3 baseplates for the first floors. This is easier because of the use of the big stone walls. The right and left side are the same only opposite with on one side a blacksmith's place&nbsp;and on the other side a good prison. The front entrance is made of 2 massive wooden doors that also is a good solid construction. All over the fortress you use small plates in between to make place for a large amount of banners. When finished making all the separate buildings you put the 6 parts together with as result a great looking strong Fortress !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts&nbsp;5 bricks:&nbsp;parts are&nbsp;perfect but I almost distracted one brick. Although the broad baseplates make a strong whole of the set I dislike them but that is my opinion. Further on this set has nothing but great parts. A good amount of great minifigures with a huge load of weapons for both parties&nbsp;and nice accesoires like the plants, climbing rope, great traps, lovely banners and flags. The Ninja robbers with the great masks that allow them to carry their swords on their backs. The stone&nbsp;wall parts, the white panels and broad slopes and fish ornaments for the Oriental look. Also a compliment for the great colourscheme Lego used for the Ninja sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playabilty 5 bricks: All present here for kids to play with, a great Fortress, 9 minifigures including one&nbsp;horseman&nbsp;and all kinds of traps within the fortress. A big 5 !!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks: more for me than for the average price. Although it is a great set and hard to find an average of €100,00 is a lot of money for a used set with a new price of €70,00. In the end it might be worth it because I think the value will raise and also because you can use it with other themes.&nbsp;5 Bricks for me because I paid less than halve that price.</p>",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"LegoMunchy88","2011-06-03T16:29:54.977Z","My Favorite LEGO Set. Period. ","<p>The Flying Ninja's Fortress is, in my opinion, Lego's best set ever. With an abundance of great parts, minifigs, and amazing playability, this set is great. And, best of all, it doesn't have any BURPS, like other Ninja sets. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, lets talk about the minifigs:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blue Samurai: My favorite minifig of the set. Great parts (that golden horn) and an overall nice figure. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bonsai the Black Ninja: My favorite of the three ninjas included, possibly because he is the most realistic. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ito the Grey Ninja(s): Nice, but I'm not sure why there are two when the official Lego description (From Brickpedia) says there's only one. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Blue Samurai Guards(3): Not that great of figures, but definiately a plus for the playability factor. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Robber: Well, with all robbers, I must say, I'm not exactly sure why robbers are even in this series. They wouldn't been much better off just staying with the pirates theme. I, personally, would have been completely fine with just Ninjas vs. Samurais. But, if they had to include a robber, they should've at least included the robber leader, since this is the biggest set of the series. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Set</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, onto the set. The base of the set, which is enclosed in the slanted rock pieces (which, by the way, are much nicer than BURPS) is just ok. The swinging axes are nice. The jail is great, and I'm so happy as to the fact that it can fit more than ONE person. Finally, the golden swoard holder is ok, but in an awkward place when trying to play with it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first tower, the smallest, is just a nicely built tower, with nothing in it. It's nice, but nothing special, just kind of mediocore. The second tower includes a room for the samurai with a bed and a table, which is neat, and this awesome trap including a revolving door and a skeleton and a really cool chrome crystal. The final tower, the biggest, is also nice. The bottom part is empty, but it get that, since there had to be somewhere for the ninja to fall when the trap door was released. The room above, with the trap door and scroll, is my favorite room. And finally, above that, is a room with a treasure which is just alright. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall, the Flying Ninja's Fortress in an amazing set and a great addition to any collection. (For the Right Price)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
