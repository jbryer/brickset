"Minifig290","2020-08-31T01:18:43.65Z","Great build with really fun interactive features","<p>Hello, today I&#39;ll be taking a look at one of the 10 LEGO Super Mario 71361 Character Packs. Released in August 2020, these retail for &pound;3.49/$4.99 each and have an average of 23 pieces each. The character we will be looking at today is Peepa&nbsp;who has 21&nbsp;pieces giving a price per part of 16p/23c.</p>

<p>I reviewed the 71360 Adventures with Mario already, please read that review for more on how the Mario figure works:&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/57216"">https://brickset.com/reviews/57216</a>. Let&#39;s take a look at this character and his features.</p>

<p><strong>Character</strong></p>

<p>Peepa is a unique character to the character bags with no other variants in other sets in the initial wave. Peepa uses 12 of the 21 pieces in the bag.</p>

<p>Peepa is built on a standard unprinted 2x3 white brick, with four 1x1 bricks with stud on one side, three in the front and one in the back middle surrounded by two 1x2 sloped white bricks. Finally, topped with a 1x2 white brick with two 1x2 curved pieces on either side. Placed on the 3 front side studs is an exclusively printed 3x3 rounded tile with Peepa&#39;s face on, this has its mouth wide open and looks quite joyful, then on the back side stud is its interactive tile with its pre-applied sticker on a 2x2 round tile.</p>

<p>Now what does Peepa&#39;s interactive tile do?, well its actually got quite an interesting feature. When Mario jumps on the tile Peepa makes a scream and Mario is startled which will not allow him to collect coins for a second or two. To defeat Peepa and get coins you need a Star power up from either the Question Block which comes in the start course or a Star block that only comes in Mario&#39;s House set. With the Star block you can defeat Peepa and collect 12 coins.</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>So with every single character in these blind bags you also get a small build to extend your courses with. This is great for anyone not wanting to buy any Mario sets for the builds but wants some of the new 4x4 rounded plates which Peepa has in a red colour. Built on this plate is a small wall build that consists of 3 1x2&nbsp;brick bricks in light bluish grey with 2 1x3 arch bricks and a 1x2 jumper plate to place Peepa on. Coming out of one of the arches is a stream of lava made of just a 1x1 orange plate with a 1x1 modified plate with curve in a light orange.</p>

<p>Each blind bag also includes extra parts which is great, this set has 1&nbsp;being the 1x1 orange plate.</p>

<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>I absolutely love these Character bags and this figure is no exception, the figure is really cute and has some nice pieces, I really love the little build that comes with Peepa too and it&#39;s nice to get the red plates in a cheaper way for anyone who wants the plates but none of the larger Mario sets. Unlike Bullet Bill who&#39;s interactive feature disappointed me, Peepa&#39;s feature is unique and something I appreciate&nbsp;that makes the game play more interesting.</p>

<p><strong>Pros - </strong>Great overall build and pieces, love the interactive feature, cheap way to get some new pieces</p>

<p><strong>Cons -</strong> None to mention</p>

"Romans122","2020-11-10T23:57:09.35Z","Best of the character series.","<p>I don&#39;t like Lego&nbsp;blind bags in general, but this small treasure is worth attention.</p>

<p>The platform features a lava base and&nbsp;some great light bluish gray bricks. It is fairly simple but captures a lot of detail for 9 parts.</p>

<p>The Peepa is the most functional of any on the Super Mario blind bag characters. You need star power to defeat it, which yields an impressive 12 coins! Attempting to kill him normally will&nbsp;make Mario scared. Peepa&nbsp;can be rescanned for a coin under any condition.</p>

<p>My favorite part is this the most economical way to play the new &quot;Halloween Haunting&quot;&nbsp;game variant. This is done&nbsp;by scanning a ghost (Peepa, Boo, or King Boo)&nbsp;and then starting a run. In this mode, Boo&nbsp;will occasionally look&nbsp;at you (with an audio cue), during which you have to stay still. If you are successful you get a generous coin reward. By using this with&nbsp;the Starter Course I was able to get 210 coins!&nbsp;</p>

<p>My only complaint is that Peepa&#39;s&nbsp;face looks too cartooish, although it does use a brand new 3x3 round tile. I wouldn&#39;t recommend this if you have Bowser&#39;s Castle Boss Battle since&nbsp;Boo is functionally identical.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>In summary,</p>

<p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Nice selection of parts- including the new 3 x 3 round tile</li>
	<li>Extremely functional</li>
	<li>Cheapest way to play the &quot;Halloween Haunting&quot; game variant.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Face isn&#39;t my personal favorite.</li>
	<li>Not recommended if you have Bowser&#39;s Castle Boss Battle since the Boo functions the same.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Happy playing!</p>
