"Struhadlo","2020-08-11T18:46:14.063Z","Surprisingly good but could be little better","<p>Now when this set was rumoured I was somewhat excited about the prospect of having this ship in its most refined and up-to-date version. As more details kept being revealed, my excitement started to decline, especially at the point when both minifigs were shown. As with every single re-make folks on reddit kept their whiny attitude about this being too soon for a re-make, but I degrease. It has been six years since the last one and the building techniques have improved noticeably since then, furthermore not everyone was around back in 2014 to pick this up and it is a decently popular vehicle, so why not.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite my hype decreasing below the point of any interest at all, I have recently purchased this set and as per usual when my expectations are none existent I was pleasantly surprised.</p>

<p><strong>PRICE</strong></p>

<p>On paper 30 dollars for a ship of a decent size with a pilot and a droid might sound fine as it works well enough with <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75248-1/Resistance-A-wing-Starfighter"" target=""_blank"">75248</a>, but in actuality the price is perhaps the weakest point of this package as there are not that many pieces and the minifig selection seems poor when the set is completed. The price is not too terrible, there are far worse cases of a blatant theft in this very wave of summer sets, but 30 dollars just does not feel right to me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Either make this a 25 dollars set, or give us one or two more minifigs. Perhaps an updated buzz-droid with a battle droid or a pair of Super Battle Droids considering their criminal lack in the recent years.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, the price is no major drawback I just feel like there could have been wee bit more for the price and this is even more obvious since this has been released right next to <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75280-1/501st-Legion-Clone-Troopers"" target=""_blank"">75280</a>&nbsp;which not only has around 40 more pieces but also comes with four more minifigs.&nbsp;I have asked my wife about her opinion on which of these two sets brings more value and according to her it is the Anakin&rsquo;s interceptor as it is a bigger vehicle than the AT-RT and BARC Speeder so who knows.</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Anakin Skywalker. Galaxy&rsquo;s most charismatic child murderer comes with nicely detailed legs&nbsp;and torso print which represent the Jedi robes worn by Anakin in the film sufficiently. The garnet connects through the waist seamlessly and the belt print is also a nice detail.&nbsp;The skin representation under the neck is pathetic and does not match the skin tone of the head at all. One hand is of the regular skin colour and the right one is correctly dyed in black to represent the glove covering the robotic arm. Head has two expressions one of which is of&nbsp;fear and the other of a mild amusement. Both faces are accompanied by a microphone print. The Jedi mas.. haha you wish, knight is armed with a regular blue lightsaber and the blade is not frosted in this case. The glaring problem of this minifig is the unjustifiable&nbsp;re-use of the torso from the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75269-1/Duel-on-Mustafar"" target=""_blank"">75269</a>&nbsp;which does not make any sense. The burnt&nbsp;robes are burnt&nbsp;by the flames and the lava from the duel on Mustafar and at this point of the film which is the beginning in which this ship gets destroyed, the robes are in a perfect condition. You could argue that Lego is cutting the corners due to the COVID-19 situation, but I call that bollocks! One or rather two re-used prints are not going to save the company a fortune and the production&nbsp;of this set might have started even before the whole outbreak. Why would Lego try to cheap out&nbsp;on such a dumb detail is beyond me considering they have introduced new Clone head, new faces for the Imperial Troopers and new prints and probably even molds for this very wave. Very strange and I hope Lego replaces this in any further iterations of this set. And yeah by the way the hair mold is pretty rad.</li>
	<li>RD-D2. A classic R2 we are used to with no changes or new features, Print is detailed as always and represents the film counterpart pretty well.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>To address the issue of re-making a set which is already good enough, I must say that the building technique is much improved over the 2014 model. The base for the fuselage is more complex and much smarter than of its predecessor. The cockpit area is again different and perhaps little simpler but sufficient still. The wings have an updated and little more piece-hungry build, but it is not much different from the previous one. Overall the building process is fun and since the wings are not identical, there is not much redundancy. There are 8 stickers 4 of which are used as what I suppose are solar panels on the inner sides of the winglets. One sticker is used as a control panel inside the cockpit and the small one-stud circle on the left wing bearing the republic insignia is now a sticker too. In my case the sticker is not centred correctly and thusly there is a thick black half circle&nbsp;on one side. Last two stickers are at the back with the beige and dark red circle. None of these are anyhow difficult to apply even for a shaky-hands drooler like me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The left wing can hold an Astromech droid of the R2 size. Only head shows at the top and the rest of the body is hidden in the wing. Yes, the wing is pretty thick but you can see the body and the legs of the droid from the inner side of the wings. The winglets can move in a 180-degree angle. The wings are joint with the cockpit by two technic pieces and the connection I consider to be rather strong. As for their movement, they can be configured in two position. First is depicted on the official art work and the second is created by lifting the wings into a horizontal position. There is a single clip&nbsp;at the bottom of each wing for a weaponry storage. According to the building manual you are to place a lightsaber in one of these two clips. In my opinion it is better to place the spring-loaded shooter missiles there and store the lightsaber in the cockpit. Speaking of cockpit, whole windscreen&nbsp;is printed and can be opened easily. There is no mechanism to hold it securely in the opened position, but it also does not fall back by itself. Once close, the cockpit does not open unless you open it manually. The minifig fits the seating area without any issues and there is still a plenty of space left. Two spring-loaded shooters are placed at the bottom of the fuselage. The model does not pride itself with any fancy&nbsp;firing mechanism so in order to shoot out the missiles you just press them down at the back of the ship and that does the trick. In other words you&nbsp;can see them sticking out once the guns are loaded.</p>

<p>Whole build is very sturdy and there are no part which would fall down upon the slightest contact. Only somewhat shaky part is the windscreen once fully opened, so there is no annoying wiggle when you play with this interceptor.</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>As&nbsp;with almost every Lego Star Wars ship, you can swoosh it around in peace. Spring-loaded shooters are nowadays incorporated into almost every vehicle from this line, and they are present in this star fighter as well. Unfortunately mere two minifgs do not provide much of a playability and this is where few opposing droids would do a lot for this&nbsp;set&rsquo;s playability. Kids will definitely be able to get some play value here, but other sets will be necessary to get the full potential this set holds as a single ship with no enemies can get wee bit boring after the initial excitement passes.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>At the end of the day, this is more than a decent set. It is a brand new, great looking&nbsp;and improved model with sturdy and well-rounded build and works fine as a toy and as a display piece, maybe even better as&nbsp;the latter. &nbsp;The price is little steep considering the volume of stuff presented here and the torso re-use is just mind boggling. But the pros outweighs the cons here big time, and I can fully recommend getting this one. I would personally wait for a discount for some time so that the Lego can see that we are not supporting their lazy attitude with the torso print, but I myself have lost this battle so who am I to tell you when or how to buy it haha.</p>

"Green_Bricks","2020-10-02T22:50:08.197Z","""This is where the fun begins""","<p>First, apologies for the title; I&#39;m sure it&#39;s everyone&#39;s first thought, but I couldn&#39;t pass up the chance! Okay, onto the review:</p>

<p>I feel like the community is in a weird position with this set; it follows from a rendition of this craft released in 2014, which is admittedly near identical, and as a result it has been shunned by many. However, I find myself in a different boat. It was only during lock down in which I discovered my love of Star Wars, thus I only owned 1 or 2 sets from the theme before this year. That 2014 set is no longer available in stores, so for the purposes of this review, it didn&#39;t have any negative effect on my overall personal opinions. I actually really like this set, and it was one of the few sets I&#39;ve ever bought on release from the LEGO store, without waiting for a sale. It even won me over in competition with the 501st set, and any LEGO Star Wars fan will know that&#39;s high praise! I mean, it&#39;s helped by the fact&nbsp;that it contains a minifigure version&nbsp;of the second most iconic prequel&#39;s&nbsp;character (behind Jar Jar Binks of course), but beyond that it has plenty of merits to be explored...</p>

<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p>As a MOC builder, I find building sets to be a relaxing break from all the tinkering that comes with designing a model, so I usually rate building experience highly. Obviously the wings are near identical, so not a lot of variety there, but the cockpit goes together nicely and the opening cover fits on satisfyingly. Really should have been a 5/5, but the stickers hold it back;&nbsp;more specifically, one of the stickers. That 1x1 round sticker is just cruel; not only would it be easy for LEGO to print, it&#39;s an absolute nightmare&nbsp;to put on! The panels are less annoying, because at least they have nice straight edges to line up. Still, I managed to get my stickers on alright, so I can&#39;t rate it any lower than a 4 overall.</p>

<p><strong>Completed model</strong></p>

<p>Personally, I really like the look of this craft in-universe, and the LEGO version is aesthetically pleasing too. I&#39;m glad they chose to do Anakin&#39;s craft, because the yellow works really nicely here. Nothing too fancy if I&#39;m being honest, but all the lines blend cleanly into one another; if we&#39;re talking specific details,&nbsp;the underwing turrets work nicely for me, as well as the printing on the cockpit pieces. I&#39;m usually a displayer of sets, but if you&#39;re so inclined,&nbsp;it&#39;s at a perfect scale for swooshability, and the designers have sneakily placed a clip on the underside of each wing for lightsaber storage. This allows Anakin to sit in the pilot&#39;s seat and close the cockpit without him burning through any of the controls! I was expecting something bigger, but overall, it looks wonderful, and would fit into any LEGO collection, Star Wars or otherwise.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>Anakin Skywalker - others have already pointed out that this figure is re-used from set 75269 Duel on Mustafar, which is canonically incorrect and pretty lazy of LEGO. However, if you don&#39;t look too closely, this figure is a perfectly good representation of the iconic character. The face printing with headset works well with Anakin&#39;s long hair, which is a really nice piece for someone who hasn&#39;t owned this figure previously. I wish he had a happy expression, rather than just serious or outright angry, but if you&#39;ve seen the prequels, you&#39;d know what kind of person Anakin is, so the lack of happier facial expressions is an acceptable omission. The lightsaber is also appreciated.</p>

<p>R2-D2 - What can I really say about this figure? I only own 4 Star Wars sets, and this is already the second one to contain him!&nbsp;He looks perfectly fine, and he is definitely necessary to the set, being able to sit in the wing and help control the ship, but he&#39;s nothing special.</p>

<p><strong>The 3 Ps</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>P</strong>rice - &pound;24.99 is a bit steep, but if I&#39;d waited a few weeks I probably would&#39;ve been able to get if for closer to &pound;20. As mentioned earlier, the ship felt a bit small for a price that got me a full on playset with 4 minifigures from the Ninjago theme. Anyway, I&#39;d recommend waiting for a sale, especially if you already own the 2014 version</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong>layability - I&#39;ve already said that the ship is swooshable, and additional features include folding out wing flaps, room for R2 to sit embedded into the left wing, spring-loaded shooters &amp;&nbsp;an opening cockpit with room for one minifigure. Plenty for the kids (or creative adults)</li>
	<li><strong>P</strong>arts - a few upgrades from 2014, such as the 2x2 wedge plates, alongside some nice yellow parts for the MOC builders. That cockpit is nicely done, and a blessing that it&#39;s not a sticker! I don&#39;t know if you&#39;d be able to turn a profit on Bricklink, but if you needed to steal any parts for a MOC, you could temporarily tear down this set and it would do the job</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>If I had to summarise this set, I&#39;d say it was the perfect birthday gift for a young Star Wars fan, and a perfectly passable rendition of the craft it&#39;s trying to represent. Slightly off-topic, so you can leave now if you want, but I&#39;m glad that I built this set, because it&#39;s finally got me back into writing reviews after months of not building sets. It feels counterintuitive, but because I haven&#39;t been building MOCs after going back to school, I&#39;ve had to get my LEGO dose in with shorter chunks, and that&#39;s come in the form of reducing my mini backlog despite having a larger workload to deal with. Anyway, I guess that means more reviews will potentially follow, especially with my birthday coming up in a couple of days, so if you enjoyed this one, I&#39;ve got 5 more helpful ones (and a few less helpful ones...) that you can peruse at any time.</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2020-12-27T14:14:23.88Z","A pity that this clearly evolved build suffers from bad decision making on legos part ","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>Anakins Jedi interceptor is a fantastic and accurate build but the Anakin Minifigure included has a major accuracy issue with his torso and the lack of a third figure ( cough cough Dooku hasn&#39;t been in a set since 2013) also in another blow against the set along with another regarding the choice of putting a sticker on a certain piece .</p>

<p>The Minifigures -</p>

<p>The Anakin Minifigure has a nice and accurate hair piece in redish brown , a face print with his pilot headset with a smirking and angry expression , his torso shows his Jedi robes but hang on , why are there burn marks from mustafar&nbsp; as Lego reused the torso from the dual on mustafar which is not accurate to any scene with Anakin near his starfighter from the clone Wars or episode three and his legs continue his robe detail , he wields a standard blue bladed lightsaber , R2-D2 is also included as expected with his printed silver 2&times;2 some head , round canister like body and his two astromech legs in white .</p>

<p>The build-&nbsp;</p>

<p>The build starting with the cockpit uses the large Jedi interceptor windshield piece used since 2005 and this one is the most detailed yet with lots of printing including the republic insignia and silver lining to highlight where the individual windows are in a transparent black colour , this is openable with a technique using a 1&times;2 modified light grey brick to embed it , the front features a 4&times;4 trans blacklist with more TIE fighter inspired cockpit printing which is attached with a snot technique and the interior has space for one figure lying down with a very comfy looking back rest using redish brown slopes and there is a 1&times;2 dark grey slopes with a sticker for the controls . The wings are almost mirrored on both sides and both have two solar panel stickers on the wing pieces in yellow one above and one underneath they are connected with bars and clips and can move in skittles of directions , the ends of rack wings slope in towards the cockpit and both have a light grey nexo knights shield with a republic emblem sticker on each surrounded by grilles and some brick slopes up to the side of the cockpit , there is a variety of different wing plates and angle plates used throughout in yellow and light grey colours , there is a slot for R2-D2 while the other wing that does not accommodate him has a 2&times;4 light grey tile , 1&times;6 yellow tiles lead towards the front and the very tip of the front slopes back a tiny bit , near R2-D2s slot there is a 1&times;1 light grey round tile with a STICKER on it , now I am not the sort to get angry about stickers but having one on a 1&times;1 is ridiculous especially as the previous model from 2014 had this printed and that printed piece came in a MICROFIGHTER republic gunship this makes me more angry than the torso situation and finally the cannons are now dark grey from the usual black using cones , technic axle pins , buffers and long bars and to accompany these cannons there are a pair of tiny ones half way up the wings using a black lightsaber hilt each . And finally the underneath of the ship features two thrusters using 2&times;2 trans light blue dishes and a stack of 2&times;2 black round plates attached with technic at the back , there is also a pair of spring loaded shooters in light trans green and a pair of clips underneath the solar panels one for the lightsaber and one for the spare spring load .</p>

<p>In conclusion -&nbsp;</p>

<p>this would be a very very nice set of Lego hadn&#39;t made so many stupid decisions with the lack of Dooku , an accurate torso for Anakin and the sticker on a 1&times;1 so overall I only recommend getting this if you really need a Jedi interceptor like I did but there is no reason to get this if you have the 2014 one as this is just an evolved rendition of that but still I hope we get Obi-wans Jedi interceptor in summer 2021 .</p>

"CaptainKindling","2020-12-06T18:03:58.267Z","This is where the fun begins.","<p>For all of the flack they drew at the time of release, the Star Wars prequels have aged remarkably well, with Revenge of the Sith being named as many fans&#39; favourite movie of the franchise.&nbsp; But love them or loathe them, one undeniable thing about the prequels was that they gave us some fantastic looking vehicles, particularly from the Clone Wars era, including the Jedi Interceptor as seen in the opening battle of Episode III.</p>

<p>This is the third Lego incarnation of the yellow Jedi Interceptor as flown by Anakin Skywalker, but with this being the only version I&#39;ve built personally I have no point of comparison, so will be assessing this set purely on its own merits.</p>

<p>With an RRP of &pound;25 and coming in at 248 pieces, this is pretty average as far as value for money goes. However, possibly due to so many fans already having a previous version of this particular ship, the price seemed to have sharply dropped upon release, and it&#39;s frequently seen on the likes of eBay brand new for just under &pound;20, making it excellent value.</p>

<p>The build is split across 3 bags, and as you&#39;d expect from the design of the ship there is some repetition to be found.&nbsp; Bag 1 gives you the minifigures and the cockpit, and bags 2 and 3 are the two wings, so are mirror builds of eachother.&nbsp; As an adult, this took me around 40 minutes to assemble, and I can&#39;t imagine younger builders taking much more than 1 1/2 hours to have their Interceptor ready to take flight.</p>

<p>It&#39;s certainly a satisfying build, taking shape nicely in quick time.&nbsp; As with many Star Wars ships, the canopy is a single moulded and printed piece to give the Interceptor its iconic look which would have been difficult to achieve with multiple bricks.&nbsp; Otherwise there aren&#39;t any particularly unusual or unique pieces involved in the build, making it a quick and simple job.</p>

<p>There are a few stickers on this set, and while there are more sticker-heavy sets out there, this does feel like at least a couple of them could have been replaced with printed pieces.&nbsp; Would it really have been that much trouble to print a Republic logo onto a 1x1 round tile? Because applying that sticker was a little fiddly!</p>

<p>Once assembled, Anakin&#39;s Jedi Interceptor is a really nice little ship, and certainly looks the part.&nbsp; The build is sturdy, so should survive younger fans putting it through its paces.&nbsp; Anakin fits snugly into the cockpit, even though he does have to lean back at a slightly awkward angle in order to close the canopy, and of course R2-D2 fits into the astromech slot on the wing.&nbsp; There are two spring-loaded shooters tucked under the cockpit, which only protrude slightly from the back of the ship for firing.&nbsp; The wings and fins can each be adjusted.&nbsp; And there&#39;s even a clip subtly placed under the wings to store Anakin&#39;s lightsaber while he&#39;s flying.&nbsp; All in all, a really nicely designed model.</p>

<p>Minifigure-wise, this is where the set becomes a little controversial.&nbsp; R2-D2 is R2-D2, there&#39;s nothing special or different about him, but of course you can&#39;t have Anakin&#39;s Jedi Interceptor without him.&nbsp; However, Anakin is the issue for many collectors.&nbsp; While he is a nice minifigure with a good level of detail all across the board, Lego have reused the torso and legs from the 75269 Duel on Mustafar set, meaning he has the dirt and burn marks from his fight with Obi-Wan... which doesn&#39;t happen until much later in the movie.&nbsp; At this point, his outfit should be pretty much spotless.&nbsp; As the first Anakin of my collection I wasn&#39;t put off by this, but it is a bit of an oversight on Lego&#39;s part, and has caused some frustration among AFOLs.</p>

<p>So overall, I thought it was a fantastic set.&nbsp; Yes, it is another Anakin&#39;s Jedi Interceptor (at least it&#39;s not as regular as his son&#39;s landspeeder!), and the question could be asked as to why we didn&#39;t get Obi-Wan&#39;s instead, which has only been released once to-date.&nbsp; And yes, some of the stickers really should have been printed pieces.&nbsp; And yes, we have the issues with the innacurate Anakin minifigure.&nbsp; But it&#39;s a clean build, sturdy, playable, displayable, and is great value for money if you have a good look around.</p>

I also missed out on this set in 2014, so hearing that this ship would return, I had to get (plus I got Obi-Wan&#39;s in 2016, so I wanted to complete the duo). The ship looks great when completed, one thing that I liked was that it came with a piece that holds the lightsaber, so now I won&#39;t have to put somewhere else. I was also surprised the flick missiles are made differently (ex: I dropped one, and I did with another I owned, and&nbsp;they sounded different). Figures are okayish, I&#39;m glad I finally own an R2-D2, and another Anakin is nice. Though, I felt it was a missed oppurtunity to give him is normal look instead of the Mustafar printing on the torso.

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set currently exists as a standalone piece: no accompanying trifighters, vulture droids, booster ring, or other ARC-170 fighters to go with it as a play feature, perhaps highlighting the necessity of those &quot;recolor&quot; sets from earlier lines. Despite this, the quality of this single model makes it a fantastic display piece.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The blasters this ship comes equipped with are some of the most effective blasters I&#39;ve seen in LEGO, with a simple push on the bullets launching them across the room (heads up: I was only able to find them after because my cat would run to their landing spot. Don&#39;t shoot the bullets in cluttered areas).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The minifigs included in this set are pretty standard: Anakin with his headset is a nice unique print, and R2 is the same model we keep seeing every time, complete with his tendency to be printed crooked, which really irks me. It&#39;s a good thing one of my many R2&#39;s came out perfect.</p>
