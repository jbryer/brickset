"Automaton120","2020-08-08T15:20:32.507Z","Not bad, but could do with a minifig or two more ","<p>First of all, I think this is pretty good. The cannon is a bit long, but aside from that I think it&#39;s far superior to previous versions of this tank both in terms of shape and parts usage (these two things are not mutually exclusive in this case). Lots of curved pieces and the missile firing system is cleverly disguised, though I do find the exhaust hinges to be a bit loose.</p>

<p>The minifigures are definitely the main draw here. Ahsoka and the clone are excellent (the new clone head is absolutely amazing, and I didn&#39;t even hate the &quot;angry clone&quot; they used previously). This could probably have done with an additional clone or two for the price, especially when the 501st set costs $10 less and contains four figures and two droids, but since the vehicle alone was of interest to me I wasn&#39;t particularly put off by the cost. I do like the green battle droids as well.</p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s pretty solid. I can see why just the one clone, and this set being its only appearance, is frustrating to some collectors but since this era is not my preferred choice for army building it&#39;s not a huge deal for me. Just a great figure that I&#39;m glad to have in my collection, even if it&#39;s just the one for now.</p>

"TheBrickDudeStudios","2020-08-19T12:39:50.9Z","Not the most accurate set.","<p>This is set 75283. It comes with 286 pieces and has four minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Minifigures</h2>

<p>This set comes with four minifigs. They are two AAT battle droids, Ahsoka&nbsp;Tano, and Ahsoka&#39;s 332nd trooper.</p>

<h3>AAT battle droid</h3>

<p>This set comes with two AAT battle droid but the box of the se says that one of them is an AAT battle droid and the other one is a regular battle droid. I think that is there to show that one of them is supposed to drive the AAT.</p>

<p>The battle droid&#39;s head has some sand green printing at the back and some regular green at the front. He has a sand green battle droid body. The rest of the parts of the driver are the same as a plain battle droid.</p>

<h3>Ahsoka</h3>

<p>Ahsoka&nbsp;has the same hair piece as Shaak Ti. It has different printing than Shaak Ti, with some dark blue stripe printing.</p>

<p>Her head is orange which is a little too bright for the color of her skin. She has blue eyes which are not in the older clone wars style. She has white markings on her face that are&nbsp;accurate to the show. She has two expressions on her face. One is slightly happy and the other one is slightly angry.</p>

<p>Her body has printing that looks like Mandalorian bodies with the same hexagon shape in the middle. Below that there is a silver belt print. The back of her body has the back of her belt and some gold markings that mach the hexagon on the front.</p>

<p>Her legs are in light gray with a dark blue hip piece. It has some gold and silver stripe printing on a dark blue background. Her hip piece continues the belt print on the body.</p>

<h3>332nd trooper</h3>

<p>The 332nd trooper&#39;s helmet has orange printing and stripes that look similar to Ahsoka. The helmet has gray printing on the cheeks of the helmet.</p>

<p>His head is the new nougat color for the clone trooper heads.</p>

<p>He has the same body print as the 501st troopers with the blue stripe that is on the front of the body. Below that there is some belt details. On the back of the body there is a lot&nbsp;of detail that I don&#39;t know the names of.</p>

<p>The legs are the same as the 501st trooper with blue knee pads and a white hip piece instead of what most of the black hip piece that most of the other clones had before this year. This trooper even has some feet printing which is rare.</p>

<h2>Build</h2>

<p>This set only comes with one build and it is the AAT. This set would be better if it had a side build of some kind.</p>

<p>The first thing you probably notice is when you look at the set is the cannon, so I will start there. The cannon is too big. It should come to about half of the length it is. The space that the AAT battle droid goes into is too big also. You can open the hatch up and place the battle droid inside but you have to put his head down to fit him in. Next to that there are two antennae. One of them is taller than the other. The cannon on the front can move up and down and the whole top can move 360 degrees around.</p>

<p>The middle of the front has another hatch that you can open up. Inside there are two control panel prints that are both different. You can put a battle droid in there and close it.</p>

<p>The sides of the AAT are the same but in reverse. The sides have a cannon that can move up and down. It is&nbsp;not&nbsp;accurate to the real thing because the taller gun should be on the top but the lego one has the longer one on the bottom.</p>

<p>On the front bottom there are two big quarter round circle pieces that are not the same as the ones from the Diner set. The ones from the Diner set are much smaller than the ones in this set and the ones in this set have studs on the top. Behind that there are the only stickers on this set and it is the Separatist logo.</p>

<p>The back of the AAT is not detailed at all. I don&#39;t own&nbsp;the older AAT but I know that the other one has better detail on the back.</p>

<h2>My&nbsp;opinions&nbsp;</h2>

<p>In my opinion this is a good set. It could use another 332nd trooper and it could use a side build. The big cannon should be shorter and the two guns on the side should be flipped. Other than that this is a good set and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the clone wars.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-11-28T08:26:56.193Z","A Missed Opportunity, But Still a Decent Set","<p>Two sets were released for the final season of the Clone Wars and this is the one I was most excited about as it features Ahsoka alongside one of her troopers. I typically never buy a set solely for the minifigures, but this was one I would have made an exception for had it not been for the price. This set has just one more brick than <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75280-1/501st-Legion-Clone-Troopers"">75280</a>, and has two less minifigures, yet it cost $10 more! Now it does have larger bricks, but certainly not $10 larger, and I really would have loved more of Ahsoka&#39;s troopers, one just isn&#39;t enough. Luckily it went on sale for Black Friday so I picked one up.</p>

<p>But that is not why I call the set a missed opportunity, the real issue with this set is it completely ignored the storyline and had so much more potential. Ahsoka reunited with members of the 501st to aid Bo-Katan during the Seige of Mandalore. A battle between Mandalore and Darth Maul. There were no separatists involved, and certainly no battle droids or AAT&#39;s. Imagine if alongside Ahsoka and her trooper, you also got Bo-Katan, Maul, and a Mandalorian loyal to Maul! Now that would have been an epic set. The build could have been location based as opposed to vehicle based, and we would have had a Lego Mandalore, or at least a part of it, not to mention the coolest collection of minifigures from the galaxy far, far away. Even better, it would have tied in perfectly with the Mandalorian series, although I admit Lego had no way of knowing what would have happened over the first 5 episodes of season 2 at the time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So definitely an opportunity missed, but still a decent Lego set. So on with the review.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Minifigures</p>

<p>Ahsoka of course is the star of the show and she does not disappoint. She has longer lekku on this minifigure than on other Clone Wars variants, putting this set more in line with Rebels. I feel this was a strange choice as she is still very young at this time, but perhaps the shorter ones would have seemed too short. Her live action appearance features shorter lekku out of necessity, so it is kind of nice we get these longer ones as we may not see them again. The other issue is she features dual blue lightsabers, and while the dual sabers are accurate, they should have been white as this is when Anakin gave her the white lightsabers.</p>

<p>Her clone trooper has the same torso and legs as the other new 501st troopers, but has the helmet featuring Ahsoka&#39;s face. It is a very clean design, very unlike the crude paintings the clones put together on a moments notice. In a galaxy where these helmets are always flawless, I really wish that Lego would have emphasized the flaws in the paint jobs, it would have made a very unique trooper just that much more unique.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Beyond that you get two battle droids that actually have some colors to them, but at the end of the day are still just battle droids.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Build&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall it was an easy but enjoyable build. It&#39;s a smaller model so I didn&#39;t expect too much, but it was fun and relaxing. The build was rather predictable and of course was also symmetrical. Like 75280, it features some bricks reminiscent of Classic Space, namely the long antenna and the short adjustable antenna, combined with a blue and gray color scheme, except it uses a navy blue instead of a regular blue.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Model&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is my second AAT as I have the original one from 2000, <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7155-1/Trade-Federation-AAT"">7155</a>. It&#39;s rather amazing how different these are and obviously Lego is capable of producing much sleeker designs these days. The color schemes are completely different and the original set is much larger in size. I think this set could have benefited from being slightly larger, but that isn&#39;t a huge deal. The real issue is the two sets look absurd side-by-side, but this new set does look better. It accomplished the gap in the front at the bottom with design instead of the original model&#39;s print. I also think that individual components of it are much better scaled. It also relies more on appropriate brick selection to give it detail, where the original relies mainly on printing. This set is definitely the better of the two, but the different color schemes obviously dictate which set should be used where.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall</p>

<p>While I have many problems with what this set could have been, as well as some inaccuracies, what this set is is a nice solid set with two very cool minifigures. I enjoyed it much more than 75280 as it is a single larger build as opposed to two smaller builds. Still, I probably wouldn&#39;t ever have bought it if it weren&#39;t for the minifigures and I absolutely do not recommend this set at full price. At a discount at least you won&#39;t feel like your being robbed. If it&#39;s on sale for significantly less, I paid $32, and you really want the minifigures then do it, otherwise save your money for something better.&nbsp;</p>

"Lobo_da_boss_","2020-09-24T16:55:30.79Z","My only set I have significantly modified ","<p>Opening;</p>

<p>This AAT in its default form is very inaccurate but can be easily modified with no extra parts although I still think this is a good set .</p>

<p>Minifigures-</p>

<p>The figures starting with Ahsoka Tano (one of the best star wars characters) her montrals are the same piece developed for Shak Ti and they are slightly inaccurate but that doesn&#39;t really bother me , her head features a happy and aggressive expression this is first ahsoka head on the Orange skin with out clone wars eyes which is another plus , her torso is part of her mandalorian outfit which continues on to the legs and she wields two regular blue bladed lightsabers , the 332nd trooper is great , just perfect , his helmet has the appropriate likeness to Ahsoka , his head is the new for summer 2020 clone head , his torso is the same as the 501st trooper , the legs also remain identical to the 501st trooper , he wields a black blaster , the kashyk..........I mean AAT pilot droid is very nice with its printed head , olive green torso , different arms , tan stationary legs and their blasters are the regular blasters in the gun metal grey colour and there are two of them in the set .</p>

<p>The build-</p>

<p>The build starting with the hood uses a very large dark blue slope on each side , along with some rounded light grey curved plates on top , the sloping continues on to the sides the stops where the only two stickers in the set are the separatist logo one on each side , the middle features some spring loaded shooters with a simple technic mechanism to fire them , the is also sloping on top of that , the very back is fairly flat and Disney look great but you don&#39;t see it too much any way , the neck has a hinged clip connection for a hatch which is sloped on the sides , with the side cannons coming from the side as well on each time with a primary cannon and range finder , opening the hatch reveals a place to put one of the two pilot droids and there is a printed 1&times;2 dark grey cheese slope with a different print on each side , the hatch has a dark blue dish and light grey sloping to compete the look . The base of the head has some forward light grey slope , a 4&times;4 black turntable , rounded dark blue tiles can be found at the very back , there is an angled engine on each side , some snot building for the curve and greebleing on the sides to complete the look , the head is rather large and is built on a 6&times;6 round plate , it also has some blue curved pieces with further light grey sloping on the front , the hatch is ok but effective , there are also some antennas made with a lever and fencing sword , the interior of the hatch can seat one droid but folded up , the cannon is sloped nicely and the barrel is unfortunately very long and inaccurate but can nicely be aimed upwards and the barrel can easily be modified in length .&nbsp;</p>

<p>In conclusion-</p>

<p>this is a good set in my opinion it has many flaws in the accuracy department but excels in the figure department maybe one more 332nd troop would be better but anyone who has watched the final episodes of clone wars will want this set so I recommend it and try modifying if&nbsp;you can I recommend flipping the side cannons , removing the 2&times;2 rounded blue brick from the side cannons and shortening the barrel length .&nbsp;</p>

"Struhadlo","2020-08-27T15:21:25.157Z","A guilty pleasure set if there ever was one","<p>Despite me liking the vehicle, colour variant and the set much more than it deserves since it plays all my notes right, I will do my best to remain as objective as possible while giving you a review of this new and confusing AAT.</p>

<p><strong>PRICE</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, as much as I try to defend each Lego set&nbsp;pricing and I find great many sets reasonably priced, this one just does not work. Demanding $40 for a 286 pieces set of this size and minifig arsenal is wee bit malapert. The finished build just does not feel right with this price tag. Some recent sets around this price provide much better value such as <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75254-1/AT-ST-Raider"" target=""_blank"">75254</a>&nbsp;which is $10 more but has nearly double the piece count and same amount of minifgs while keeping every single one of them unique until this day. Furthermore, with exception to the Ahsoka&#39;s head mold there are no unusual and difficult molds in the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Either include one more 332nd Clone Trooper and few more Battle or Super Battle Droids, or lower the price. Another feasible solution would be to add one or two more regular Battle Droids piloting a Separatist STAPs.&nbsp;For some reason Lego just stopped using any price indivisible by 10 (except for Battle Packs) when $35 would be little more reasonable here while $30 I would consider&nbsp;optimal.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>MINIFIGS</strong></p>

<p>There is this little problem with the box of the set or rather the set itself. The box shows in the&nbsp;bottom right corner the minifig selection for this set while calling one Droid a Battle Droid and the other AAT Driver Battle Droid while both are the same AAT Drivers. Perhaps originally the set was supposed to contain&nbsp;both variants but since Lego has shown an incredible laziness in this wave they decided to use just one and forgot to put back the names on the box. Or they just made an honest mistake.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Ahsoka. Clearly a highlight of the set and a reason why so many people buy it. The whole body shows a nice continuous print from the torso to the knees which lines up perfectly in the waist area. There is a decent print on the back and no arm printing. The head has two emotions one of which is a slight smirk and the other is probably supposed to look angrily but seems more worried instead. The detailing is great anyway. As for the head mold, it is made out of a rubber and is very well shaped. There are few drawbacks though. The colour at the tips of the tentacles gets blistered rather easily. Furthermore,&nbsp;this is not a correct size for the mold as this is an adult Ahsoka head mold which she is not yet by the end of the season 7 of the Clone Wars this minifig is based on. The mold gets attached to the head rather well and is difficult to remove which I find to be a great positive. You need to pull to the side in order to remove it without tearing the head from the torso. Our Order 66 survivor comes with two blue lightsabers of the same size which again is not completely accurate as if I am not mistaken she wields one regular and one shorter blade in the show. I do not mind this too much, but since the set is pretty expensive Lego could have gone the extra mile to mold a shorter blue blade.</li>
	<li>Ahsoka&#39;s 332nd Clone Trooper. If you are the owner of the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75280-1/501st-Legion-Clone-Troopers"" target=""_blank"">75280</a>&nbsp;set this trooper does not hold too many surprises for you except for the helmet, as the body is identical to the regular 501st Legion Clone Trooper. In case you do not, then the body is probably the most detailed Clone Trooper print yet with some signature blue marks on the torso and the legs. The back has a pretty detailed print too, this time without any blue. The orange is the most prominent characteristic of the helmet in which the upper colouring is mimicking the marks on Ahsoka&#39;s face. The cheek light grey shadow is still present and in the contrast of the orange does not look as natural as with the blue-white helmet of the regular 501st Trooper. The last noteworthy change here is the new head and more accurate skin tone. No more angry clone face. And there is also toe printing! Ahsoka&#39;s Clone Trooper is armed with a regular sized blaster.</li>
	<li>AAT Driver Battle Droid. A regular Battle Droid with sand green torso and more sand and regular green printing on the head. This time the blaster is in gun-metal grey. I must say I do not like the combination of the blue AAT and a green Droid, but I know this is actually accurate and my distaste is purely subjective. I am glad Lego chose to go with more accurate approach at least in this case.</li>
</ul>

<p>Overall a great minifig selection but considering the price, there should be more. It looks pretty dumb to have a $30 set in the same wave&nbsp;with two more minifigs.</p>

<p><strong>BUILD</strong></p>

<p>The building process was a lot of fun and since there is some usage of somewhat larger pieces it made me think for a moment that the price might be justified. There are some interesting building techniques and basically nothing feels redundant or boring. I would consider this to be one of the more enjoyable building times.</p>

<p>There are no unique parts as far as I am aware but the triangular grey parts creating the walls of the frontal cockpit are unique in this colour.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The finished model is very sturdy and nothing falls apart even when harshly played with. The blue colour feels extremely calming and the AAT is very nice to look at. As for the detailing, there are two stickers used with the Separatist insignia. Control panels inside the vehicle are printed and the rest is done by traditional and modern building techniques.</p>

<p>The head of the tank can rotate 360 degrees and the canon attached to it can do a 90 degree lift upside. The hatch can be opened and one Battle Droid can be hidden beneath in a sitting position with the option of fully closing said hatch still on the table. In case the Droid rises their head&nbsp;or is in a standing position, the hatch can no longer be fully closed. Side canons will rotate as much as you want until they hit the body, but they can rotate backwards without problems. The engines at the back of the neck area are attached to the body only at the bottom and their upper part can be rotated slightly backwards as well, but will not do so on themselves.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The frontal cockpit can fit one Battle Droid comfortably in a sitting position. Furthermore, it contains few control panels for the detailing purposes. There are two leavers at each side to make the spring-loaded shooters hidden at the front of the vehicle shoot. A pretty well incorporated feature if you ask me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for the downsides of the set, the canon gets a lot of hate for its length which is objectively inaccurate but I do not mind too much. What looks stupid even to me is the head housing the canon. It is just too large for the body and the shape just does not feel right as it is just too wide for my liking. What struck me first as down right ugly was the face of the vehicle. The circular shape gets interrupted&nbsp;right in the middle and the whole front just looks so wide and not too deep. I got used to both of these factors but those are still characteristics I needed to get used to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In case you do not mind the beauty factors this can be a pretty decent display set.</p>

<p><strong>PLAYABILITY</strong></p>

<p>I think this a perfect set playability-wise. The vehicle has two spring-loaded shooters, can be moved around with ease and has movable and openable parts. It includes all the minifigs needed to fully man the vehicle and has a good and strong opposition. It is safe to say that kids or anyone who buys the set with intend to play with it will get a kick out of it. In this category I see absolutely no flaw with this set.</p>

<p><strong>CONCLUSION</strong></p>

<p>At the end of they day I would recommend purchasing this set. Maybe I would wait for some discount but it is not like you are getting ripped off here, the price is just pretty steep. The value mostly lies in the minifigs and the playability. The build is very well-made except for the inaccuracies and the wideness of&nbsp;some parts which is again completely subjective. There is a reason why it is sold out everywhere but that might be just the Ahsoka factor and not the build itself.</p>

<p>A decent set with a bad price and some design problems.</p>

"CaptainKindling","2020-10-08T09:29:27.167Z","In spite of a few scale issues, a fantastic set.","<p>With the final season of The Clone Wars, Lego were kind enough to provide fans with two brand new sets: the long awaited 501st Clone Troopers, and a new Separatist AAT.</p>

<p>The AAT comes in at 286 pieces, so for &pound;35 it may feel like you&#39;re not getting a lot of bang for your buck, hence it losing a star in the value category.&nbsp; I was almost tempted to drop it down to 3 stars, but the minifigures are pretty darn amazing, and from a collectors point of view will probably claw back that initial spend in years to come.</p>

<p>The build is split into 3 bags, and took me roughly an hour to get through.&nbsp; The instructions had no especially awkward or hard to follow steps, and shouldn&#39;t cause an issue for builders of any age.&nbsp; For those who aren&#39;t fans of stickers, they are in mercifully short supply here, with just 2 identical Separatist logos to go either side of the tank body.&nbsp; As these just go onto simple smooth 2x2 plates it would have been nice for printed plates to be provided, but in a set which is pricey enough for its size I guess the use of stickers kept the cost from creeping up that bit more.</p>

<p>The build itself is definitely satisfying, with the striking blue/grey colour scheme taking shape very enjoyably.&nbsp; There is a little repetition with the tank being symmetrical, but due to the size of the AAT it doesn&#39;t take long to whizz through these parts and so doesn&#39;t feel like a drag.&nbsp; There is also only a minimal use of Technic parts, which often form the core of Star Wars sets.</p>

<p>Once assembled, the AAT has a couple of cosmetic issues, but a lot going for it playability wise.&nbsp; Due to its smaller scale, it doesn&#39;t quite capture the front shape of the tank in the way that earlier sets such as 7155 and the more comparable 8018 did.&nbsp; Instead, it&#39;s much more like the tan coloured 75080, with the front end being more of a bump than a smooth curve.&nbsp; The turret, however, is the most glaring issue, being hugely oversized.&nbsp; I don&#39;t know if this was done to put it in better scale with the minifigs, but if you have other AATs in your collection then this will seriously stand out.</p>

<p>On the playability front, the turret turns a full 360 degrees, and the barrel can be elevated.&nbsp; The top hatch and front of the tank both open up, making room for the two Battle Droids provided.&nbsp; The side cannons swivel, and the two spring-loaded shooters can be fired from levers nicely integrated into the back of the body.</p>

<p>Minifigs wise, this is where the set gets a lot of its desirability, with Ahsoka Tano and a 332nd Clone Trooper (called &quot;Ahsoka&#39;s Clone Trooper&quot;&nbsp;in this set).&nbsp; The printing on both of these is fantastic, and at this point the 332nd trooper is exclusive to this set.&nbsp; It is a little bit of an&nbsp;odd choice to pair them up with a AAT, given that canonically the only mission they served together at this point in the Clone Wars was the liberation of Mandalore, but I&#39;d prefer this to the alternatives of a new Republic Gunship or Venator which would have been considerably more expensive!&nbsp; In addition to these, you also get the pair of Battle Droid pilots.&nbsp; The printing on these is clean, but they aren&#39;t anything particularly special, and the fixed legs don&#39;t allow for much in the way of dynamic posing.</p>

<p>Overall, a fantastic little set. Sure, the scale is off on the AAT, and the price-per-piece isn&#39;t exactly a steal, but it&#39;s a nice model on the whole, has a great deal of playability, and Ahsoka and her Clone Trooper are two of the nicest minifigures out at the moment.&nbsp; Highly recommended.</p>

"Scott1","2021-03-26T22:47:17.417Z","Outstanding Minifigs, Mediocre Build, Good Overall","<p>When I hear AAT, my mind immediately drifts to the classic 2009 version. While this one isn&#39;t nearly as good of a model as the old, the minifigures are, in my opinion, even better for the price.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Box/Instructions</strong></h3>

<p>The box was fairly standard for a set of this size, and the instructions were without issue.Though there is an error&nbsp;on the box; the same droid has two different names! One is labeled as &quot;Battle Droid&quot; while the other is an &quot;AAT Driver Battle Droid&quot;. I&#39;m thinking that they originally wanted to include one standard droid and one Kashyyyk/AAT Driver droid, but changed their minds at the last minute.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Parts</strong></h3>

<p>There are some very interesting and somewhat rare parts in the set, though the use of those two giant curved pieces at the front end mean you can&#39;t easily modify the tank to be more accurate. But the build in my opinion isn&#39;t what makes this set.</p>

<h3><strong>Minifigures</strong></h3>

<p>The minifigs are&nbsp;clearly the best part of the set. The Ashoka minifig is just amazing. The headpiece quality is great, the print quality is great, it&#39;s just an outstanding fig.The 332nd trooper is amazing too; the orange and blue looks great together on the minifig. And even the Kashyyyk battle droids are great. They&#39;re still pretty rare, so getting two of them in a set this cheap is good.</p>

<h3><strong>The build</strong></h3>

<p>In my opinion, the AAT is the worse of the two parts of this set. It just pales in comparison with the 2009 version. The saucer-like structure at the base of the tank is just too small and too steep. The gun is roughly the same length as the old, if not slightly longer, to make up for the size discrepancy. But it comes off as disproportioned. The turret design is pretty good though, I suppose. Then there&#39;s the issue of the torpedo tubes not being present on the front in stickered form.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But the design itself doesn&#39;t matter, because this is a toy after all. Kids won&#39;t care if it&#39;s&nbsp;disproportioned when compared to a set that was most likely discontinued before they were even born. But for teen and adult fans, I&#39;d recommend picking up the 2009 version, if you don&#39;t have it already&nbsp;and&nbsp;you want a good&nbsp;AAT.&nbsp;Get one or two of these for the figs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Playability</strong></h3>

<p>Playability is good for the price, with two of the larger missile launchers inside the tank itself. A smaller speeder like a STAP would have been nice if they wanted to improve in the playability department, but the set is fine just the way it is.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Price</strong></h3>

<p>As good as I said the minifigs are, $40 for basically 4 minifigs and a lackluster tank is a little&nbsp;steep. Not really steep, but it falls ever so slightly short of this set being a good value. Another 501st clone or another 332nd clone would have sent&nbsp;this set above and beyond, and would&#39;ve made it an instant classic.&nbsp; Even a Super Battle Droid would&#39;ve been nice. But, considering the quality and exclusivity of these figs, 4 still feels good.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><b>Overall</b></h3>

<p>If you&#39;re buying this set as an adult, chances are you&#39;re buying it for the minifigs alone. And in that case, this set delivers well. All four minifigs are amazing and are great additions to any Lego Star Wars collection. The tank does leave&nbsp;a lot to be desired, and the fact that there&#39;s only one 332nd clone (and this is most likely the only set he&#39;ll ever come in) means collecting a larger number of them is going to be a pricey endeavor. Still, this set is a must-have in my eyes just for the Ashoka alone. But if you&#39;re buying it for a younger fan, this is an amazing set considering the cool minifigs and smaller-sized and easier to build tank.</p>

"CubicWolf","2021-01-27T13:12:14.77Z","Great set for a SW fan","<p>Build: Very nice, but small build. I would prefer a bigger, more fig-scale model, but this is also nice. Keeps most of the proportions (base should be bigger/longer). Looks nice on the display. The build is easy and has a couple of interesting techniques.&nbsp;Unfortunately, side cannons are poorly mounted and can easily come off. Also,&nbsp;the model is too small to fit a droid in the turret</p>

<p>Parts: There are some useful parts. Nothing fancy. On the other hand, minifigs are AWESOME! Ahsoka is so beautiful.&nbsp;332nd troop is fine. Awesome that we have a clone&#39;s head in a different color. B1s look OK. I would be happier if they were fully covered in camouflage (both legs and arms).</p>

<p>Playability: As mention earlier, the model is too small to fit a droid in the turret. Nonetheless, both figs and the&nbsp;model can give much fun to play with. Spring shooters could have easier access (maybe just for me).</p>

<p>Value for money: As all SW sets, could be cheaper, but the value/money ratio still is quite good. We get a nice model and awesome minifigures.</p>

<p>This set includes four minifigures: Asoka Tano, a 332nd clone trooper, and two AAT driver battle droids. the AAT driver battle droids are basically normal battle droids, but they have an olive green torso, and printing on their heads. They are the same figure as in 75233 droid gunship, and 75234 AT-AP.&nbsp;Ahsoka Tano is a really nice minifigure, with some metallic printing on the front and back of her torso and her legs. the only problem is that her head piece is too long, and it should be cut off a little higher. the 33nd clone trooper is also a really cool figure. It has the torso and legs of the 501st legion clone trooper from 75280 501st legion clone troopers. the helmet has orange printing, which is exactly the same color as Ahsokas face. This figure also comes with the new clone head, which I think is much more accurate than the old one.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>build</strong></p>

<p>The build of this set nice. It is a much more accurate size than the previous clone wars style AAT. It comes with a few interesting slope and curve pieces, and has some interesting building techniques, but&nbsp;there are a couple of problems. First, the guns on the side should be flipped. When you look at the AAT from the actual clone wars show, you can see that&nbsp;the longer gun should be on top, not the shorter one, but that should be easy to fix because you can just unclip them and clip them on the other way. the other problem is that the main gun is too long. it still looks okay, but when you compare it to a picture, it just looks sort of wrong. the last thing is that the back of the AAT looks sort of weird, but that is fine because mostly you just see the front. These set took me about 45 minutes to build.</p>

<p><strong>playability</strong></p>

<p>I think that this set has really good playability. the main turret can rotate 360 degrees (which is probably too much, but it&#39;s still fun!), the main gun can move up and down, and the side guns can also move up and down. this set also includes two spring-loaded shooters, which are disguised really well. the are built into the bottom of the AAT, and you can shoot them but pressing on a small piece on the back. this is really nice because they always look weird when they are just sticking out of the set.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>value</strong></p>

<p>I think that this set is really overpriced, and it should be $30, instead of $40. 75280 501st legion lone troopers is about the same amount of pieces, and it includes six minifigures instead of four, and it costs only $30. Both sets include two exclusive minifigures, but the 502st legion clone troopers set includes three of the 501st legion clone troopers. I think this set should include at least one more 332nd clone trooper minifigure. It would be really nice to be able to get two of them.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>

<p>this is a nice&nbsp;set, but it should be ten dollars less, or include at least one minifigure. You should definitely get this set, but maybe wait until you can find it on sale.&nbsp;</p>
