<p>This is set 75284. It has 595 pieces and It is recommended for ages 9+. This set has three minifigures two of which&nbsp;are new to this set.</p>

<h2><strong>Minifigures</strong></h2>

<h3>Kuruk</h3>

<p>Kuruk is one of the Knights of Ren. He has an exclusive head piece that is in the color Gun metal gray. His helmet has two lines that wrap around the back and stop at the front. He has a silver visor and under that there is some grill details in the mouth spot.</p>

<p>His head is a plain black head.</p>

<p>He has a gun metal gray body with line detail on the left and right, and he has some belt details in the middle of the body.&nbsp; The back of his body has some line prints on it.</p>

<p>He has legs in the color gun metal gray with printing that has some silver and brown stripes near the middle that connect to the belt things on the body. Next to that there are the black lines that are the same design as what the body has.</p>

<h3>Cardo</h3>

<p>Cardo is one of the Knights of Ren. He comes with a new gun metal gray&nbsp;helmet piece. His helmet has two round dents on both sides. At the front of the helmet are two eye holes. The helmet also has a stripe that goes around the helmet.</p>

<p>Cardo has a plain black head.</p>

<p>His body is also gun metal gray (the same&nbsp;as all of Cardo besides his head). His body print has a strap with two thermal detonators. And below that there is a strap with two knifes. On the left and right of that there is a lighter gray with a silver criss-cross pattern. The back of his body has the same criss-cross pattern as the front.</p>

<p>On the left of and right of his legs there is the same criss-cross pattern as the body. There are also some other details on the legs that I don&#39;t know how to explain.</p>

<h3>Rey</h3>

<p>Rey is not an exclusive minifigure to this set. She has her classic hair in dark brown with three buns on the back.</p>

<p>Her face print has one side slightly happy and one side slightly sad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She has white robes printing with a brown belt below that. On the back there is a hoodie that is folded down and below that there is the other side of the belt.</p>

<p>Rey&#39;s legs have some skirt printing and a gap from her legs to her shoes. The legs are printed onto white legs.</p>

<h2><strong>Build</strong></h2>

<p>The build of this set is the Night Buzzard. It has no side builds which would&#39;ve made this set better.</p>

<p>I will start at the front. The front of the Night Buzzard has some sort of grill that is not made with grill pieces.</p>

<p>Moving on the right side of the vehicle (my left) mas a gun at the front with some other small details with small pieces. Next to that there are two silver tubes. Behind that there is the engine that is very loose so if you tap the engine it moves. The front of the engine has some grill pieces for detail. The top of the engine has some tiles with some grill pieces at the back. Behind that there are some trans-orange pieces that represent the fire coming out of the engine.</p>

<p>The other side of this set is almost the same as the other side just in reverse, so I will not go in to detail as much. This side has no&nbsp;gun at the side. It also has pipes near the back and it has the same build for the engine but in reverse.</p>

<p>Moving on to the top of the ship there are some small grill details and stuff but I will not go in to that much detail with those. Behind that is the biggest part of interior detail that is not even big enough to hold a minifig.&nbsp;The only detail in there is some grills. Behind that there is a small gun at the middle and a bigger one behind it. right behind the guns there is a spot to put Cardo and Kuruk but have their head and body stick out. Behind the big gun there is a satellite dish or the bridge of the ship.</p>

<p>Now for the underneath... There is no detail underneath. It is not meant&nbsp;to be viewed from underneath. There are three landing gear feet. If you push on a technic rod then the spring-loaded shooter shoots out.</p>

<h2><strong>My opinions</strong></h2>

<p>In my opinion this is a terrible set from underneath and fir interior space. This set does have good minifigs and it is good for display on a shelf that is lower than you. I would not recommend hanging this set from the ceiling because the set does not look good from underneath.&nbsp;</p>

Great design, unique minifigures, makes a great display, but terrible functionality. Can only fit figures in open hatches, the main hull section can&#39;t fit any minifigures, only play features are the little turret hatches and spring-loaded missiles. Honestly would make a far better kind of large hover tank with its hatches, than a spaceship that can&#39;t even fit a pilot. 3/5 for design, great display, and Knights of Ren, but poor functionality&nbsp;</p>

If anyone wants the 3 figures of Knights of Ren (or if he is a fanatic collector like the writer), then OK, bur! The design is very good, absolutely convincing, but &#39;appearance from the outside and disappearance from the inside&#39;: it is an empty (hollow) hull! It loses in playability, the figures have nowhere to fir properly. I honestly hope that it is released again in 2-3 years, upgraded with proper cockpit, more space, etc., even it is at the EUR150 range. The Knights of Ren, due to their latest comic stories, still have a lot to offer.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I&#39;ll start with the positives. When compared with in universe ship, the exterior seems accurate. The set also has three excellent figures. However, the question is whether the positives outweigh the negatives. They don&#39;t. The set lacks depth: there is very little useable interior space, some abysmal hatches on top which make no sense whatsoever, and an unacceptable price. Some reviews have &nbsp;said this is a good price based on the price to part ratio. However, it&#39;s only good compared to the other absurd prices of this wave! This costs nearly 0.22 cents a piece in New Zealand dollars. You get an AT-AP in 2019 for about 0.18 cents a part in New Zealand and for 120 New Zealand dollars&nbsp;instead of 130 New Zealand dollars! This should retail for 100 New Zealand dollars&nbsp;at best. I think that 110 New Zealand dollars&nbsp;would be a stretch, considering that you only get three mini figures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this model: it&#39;s overpriced and to be frank, totally inaccurate to the source material. If you want these figures, and a nice display piece, it&#39;s a good investment. Otherwise, this is just another sad example of an overpriced, badly model.</p>
