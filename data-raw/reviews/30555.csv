<p data-original-attrs=""{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"" style=""text-align:left"">The titular build of this set, Soulless One is pretty well replicated in brick form. The designers pulled off the sleek and round &quot;hot rod&quot; vibes from the movie. They also add some nice bits of greebling on the sides on the engine pods and inside the cockpit! Speaking of the cockpit, Grievous fits inside very well and strikes an imposing figure from here.</p>

<p data-original-attrs=""{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"" style=""text-align:left"">Soulless One has twin stud cannons plopped on either wing and also has a laser bolt slung underneath the main body. These play features well-placed and don&#39;t get in the way of handling the craft during &quot;swooshes&quot;!&nbsp; If you dislike the top stud cannons they&#39;re pretty easy to remove and you wouldn&#39;t even notice them missing.</p>

<p data-original-attrs=""{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"" style=""text-align:left"">However, I do have some nits to pick. The distinctive stripping of this craft isn&#39;t well conveyed. The stripes kinda disappear when the craft is at a distance. Looking at reference images and the previous LEGO kit, these strips are quite prominent from most angles/distances.</p>

<p data-original-attrs=""{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"" style=""text-align:left"">A more minor issue I have is that the ship is a bit front heavy. This leads to issues with the rear landing leg and the cockpit canopy. The rear leg doesn&#39;t really get firm contact with the ground, so the leg kinda just ends up spinning into any position it wants. A similar issue occurs with the cockpit. Any slight tap sends the cockpit flying forward and exposing Grievous. Both issues make the rear area of the kit more fiddly than I feel it should be.</p>

<p data-original-attrs=""{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"" style=""text-align:left"">This may be a old figure, but this is my first time owning this version of Grievous and what a figure it is! Grievous&#39; body and head are molded in gray plastic with a healthy slathering of white paint on top as well as some painting for his face. No see-through white prints here! The legs are also very nice, being molded in white with grey paint applied on top. In contrast to the other pieces, the figures arms feature some of the pretty bad white prints over the gray plastic molding.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-original-attrs=""{&quot;style&quot;:&quot;&quot;}"" style=""text-align:left"">Grievous comes with his iconic four light sabers, two green and two blue. These all stow away in hidden cavities in either of Soulless Ones&#39; engine pods.</p>

"Andersond","2020-10-06T23:30:29.063Z","General Grievous's Starfighter ","<p>General Grievous&#39;s Starfighter is&nbsp;the third adaptation of the General&#39;s&nbsp;personnel starfighter. The set number is 75286-1 and is the second of General Grievous&#39;s starfighters that is based on Revenge of The Sith.This set comes with three minifigures, General Grievous, Obi-Wan Kenobi, and an Airborne Clone Trooper. The set has 487 pieces and sells at the price of $80. This set is $30 more than the last version of Grievous&#39;s ship, which was $50, and the first General Grievous starfighter was $30 cheaper than the second one. While the pricing of the set continues to go up, so does the quality of the build and minifigures go up as well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Minifigures:</p>

<p>General Grievous &mdash; Grievous is the Supreme Commander of the droid armies and thus he is a rather important character during the Clone Wars. Grievous comes with all four of his lightsabers just like he has in the previous six sets that he has come in.&nbsp;This variation of Grievous is nothing new, since the same figure came out in General Grievous&#39;s Wheel bike from 2014, and General Grievous&#39;s Combat Speeder from 2018. This Grievous is white and gray and has the same amount of detail and articulation that the previous Grievous minifigures had. It would have been nice to get a new version of Grievous, or at least have Grievous as tan, like he was in the film. Nonetheless, this figure of General Grievous is still good quality and this is a great set to pick up the fiendish droid general in.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Obi-Wan Kenobi &mdash; This is the second set that this version of Obi-Wan has come in, the first being the Duel on Mustafar set that came out earlier this year. This version of the jedi master comes with his lightsaber, as well a blaster pistol, which he uses later on in the fight to kill the cyborg general. However, the odd part with this variation of Kenobi is that he has the burnt marks on his jedi robes, which he did not have until the end of the film long after Grievous had been killed. This makes this figure technically inaccurate to the set and is a little disappointing. Nonetheless, Kenobi is still a great minifigure and it is still nice to get him in another set.</p>

<p>The Airborne Clone Trooper &mdash; This figure, much like the Obi-Wan minifig, was another&nbsp;controversial&nbsp;piece that added to the set. Prior to this set being release, there was many speculating on whom this character could be. Some thought that it was going to be a Phase 2 Commander Cody, others thought that it was going to be a new magnaguard. These guesses proved to be all wrong thou, as the mysterious figure was a new Airborne Clone Trooper. While this might not be the figure that people wanted it is still a good figure and is a nice addition to this set. The Clone comes with a regular blaster, and has new printing on his torso. Another cool new detail is that all the clones this year have a new head print, which they&nbsp;have not got since 2013. This is the second set that a 212th Airborne Trooper has come out in, and while this may not be the figure that everyone wanted, it is still a good figure to have and adds to the set quite nicely.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Set: When a set has already been made it can be challenging for the designers to go in and make a new and updated version of a popular set. Sometimes it goes well, and other times it goes very poorly. However, this is not one of those cases of the remake being worse. The designer of the ship is just as if not better than the previous two sets. The ship is about the same size as the original, and has an even more sleek build to the ship, than the 2010 ship. The cockpit uses the same piece for the windshield, however this time the windshield more printing of it which is great. The cockpit opens up just like the 2010 version, however, unlike the 2010 version, the cockpit does not stay shut, so if you move the ship around the cockpit will open up and your figure will fall out. Inside the cockpit, there are two printed control pieces which are on either side, and there is plenty of room inside for Grievous to sit in with all four of his ams. Something that he was not able to do in the 2010 set. The engines of the ship are rather bulky and large, however they do have a rather sleek design to them. The 2010 version of this set had a secret compartment that could open and reveal&nbsp;two flick fire missiles, two on each side of the ship. The 2020 version has a similar feature, however instead of missiles, there is room to store two&nbsp;of Grievous&#39;s lightsabers in each engine&nbsp;when he is flying in his ship. The design of the ship has a more accurate color&nbsp;scheme with only a few pieces sticking out. Overall, this design of this ship has greatly improved with a great amount of features that are integrated into the ship rather well.</p>

<p>Conclusion:</p>

<p>This is the third version of General Grievous&#39;s Starfighter, and while the ship looks mostly the same, the design of the ship has greatly improved. The big complaint about this set that I have seen so far, is that there is no Commander Cody, and Obi-Wan is the same from the Duel on Mustafar set. While both of these are true, I do not believe that it takes anything away from the set. While getting Cody would have been amazing, the Airborne Trooper is still a good-looking figure and a nice inclusion. Obi-Wan on the other hand, I see no problem with getting the same figure again. I know that the burn marks on his robes are not there till the duel on Mustafar, however, this is not the first time that Lego has included figures that do not belong in the set, or where not there in that scene. For some this figure of Obi-Wan will be the end of the world, they say that Lego is lazy or that Lego does not care. These are the people who push Lego to make a certain product, and when Lego does, but it&#39;s not exactly what they want, they turn on Lego in a heartbeat. Anyway, another issue with this set is the price. The set costs $80 for only 487 pieces, and while this is rather high, the pricing does make sense. When looking at the set you should look at the price to piece ratio as well as the amount of stuff that you get in the set. You could buy a set with a lot of pieces, but the build is rather small because all of those pieces are little. On the other hand, you could buy a set with very few pieces, but the build is big because the set contains several bigger pieces. To conclude, this is a great set to pick up if you do not own an older version of this set and is definitely worth picking up.</p>

"PjtorXmos","2023-01-26T09:52:54.563Z","So Uncivilized....","<p>Recently I reviewed the <a href=""https://brickset.com/reviews/65044"">set</a>, that was the best way to get a new General Grievous Minifig. Well today I&#39;m going to do the polar opposite. This set is the absolute worst way to get one.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigs</strong></p>

<p>The Minifigure selection in this set feels a little bit like an afterthought. The Obi Wan Figure is super lazy. Instead of doing another print run of his torso, Lego just decided to throw the &quot;Anakin vs Obi Wan fight Version&quot; with the burnt robes into this set.&nbsp;<img alt="""" src=""https://media.tenor.com/Y7eigqgDBUUAAAAd/ewan-mc-gregor-obi-wan.gif"" style=""width: 640px; height: 360px;"" /></p>

<p>General Grievous obviously had to be included. He is as fragile as ever, so the inclusion of two spare arms is a surprise to be sure, but a welcome one. The highlight of this set&nbsp;is the Airborne Clone Trooper from the 212th. Although he&nbsp;feels pretty random in this set to be completely honest, I absolutely appreciate them including him&nbsp;(although a Cody would probably have made more sense).&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Build</strong></p>

<p>The building experience itself is pretty enjoyable, and the star fighter turns out quite sturdy overall.&nbsp;It&#39;s a tad large and doesn&#39;t fully capture the droopy and curvy lines of the original, but it&#39;s probably the closest, Lego has ever come to the original. I&#39;m a bit annoyed at the use of cones in the front, because the shape in the original is so different, but it&#39;s not that big of a deal. Actually the Lego version looks a lot more aesthetically pleasing than the original, because it isn&#39;t quite as lumpy. The sliding action of the stowage space in the engine pods is super satisfying and works great! You can even shut it by flicking the fighter forward. It&#39;s a bummer, that while doing this, the cockpit slides forward too. This is the main culprit of this build. The cockpit slides open with way too much ease and a fixing mechanism with a clip would have been very appreciated. The shooting action is very fragile, it attaches to the bottom of the fighter like it was an afterthought of the design team. The slide trigger action feels very satisfying, but is prone to misfires.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>The Price</strong></p>

<p>We inevitably have to talk about the price. PPP at 16.4 is an atrocious deal no matter how you slice it. If you want a new General, get the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75040-1/General-Grievous-Wheel-Bike"">Wheel Bike</a> used. If you want his fighter, get the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/8095-1/General-Grievous-Starfighter"">previous version</a> used. There is really nothing justifying the price. 49.99&euro; would definitely be a much better suited price point, but that is nearly 40% of the initial price (this is also the price I got it at, in some Amazon flash deal thingy).</p>

<p><strong>The Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>Just don&#39;t get this, at least don&#39;t pay more than 50 bucks for it. Get the two sets and a set of spare grievous arms mentioned above for a combined&nbsp;45 - 50&euro;&nbsp;used, it&#39;s definitely doable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

"StanSUeScotty","2021-03-06T17:00:43.997Z","Don't understand why it's sooo underrated.","<p>I want to say something about this set cuz it is definitely&nbsp;underrated in my opinions. People are talking about 2 main downsides of it: Obi Wan&#39;s figure is not accurate&nbsp;and it costs too much.</p>

<p>They are both true, but I don&#39;t think it is a big issue for the minifig, as kids won&#39;t care. Also, lego&#39;s being lazy of course, but we should blame lego instead of&nbsp;this set. And about the price, you can wait for&nbsp;discounts, as&nbsp;I got one for $56 (w/ tax). I think $50-60 is a fair price range for this set, but $80 isn&#39;t too unreasonable as it still includes a grievous, a printed cockpit window part, and some large pieces.</p>

<p>Here is my review:</p>

<p>Pros:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I enjoyed the building progress. For a small set like this, the designer still includes many fun building details in this set, such as the sliding panels on both sides of the engine.&nbsp;Friendly building techniques to kids, and no stickers.</li>
	<li>The whole model&nbsp;is very stable and tight, unlike many other small sets that are relatively fragile. Also the model is fairly accurate.</li>
	<li>For playability, I really like the design that hides all 4 lightsabers inside the engines. You don&#39;t need to worry about losing one when you put grievous inside the cockpit.</li>
	<li>Minifig includes grievous and the 212 Airborne&nbsp;Trooper, which I think are pretty good.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cons:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Playability: There is a spring shooter under the ship, as it might be dangerous to kids cuz it is normally where we hold the fighter, so that it&nbsp;easily jumps out.</li>
	<li>Value: It costs too much.</li>

"ColbyMerrill","2020-11-10T08:24:51.603Z","glossy looks can't hide this sets large retail.","<p>Overall thoughts and build:</p>

<p>Like the&nbsp;Tie Fighters and X-wings of years past with each update comes a increase in retail cost. I believe that we can all agree that this set is a wallet killer but overall it is not bad. The set like those X-wings and Tie fighters I consider minifigure scale. This set too I consider minifigure scale. And while there have only been 3&nbsp;(not including the cantina which to&nbsp;scale if not very close) UCS sets that are truly to scale with its figures. This set is not branded as UCS but for the time being I have concluded in terms of the actual build which at times is challenging. The set is the closest thing to a UCS version we may ever get Its dynamic presence with dark grey colour scheme surprisingly make it stand out from other sets from the prequels or Clone Wars. The only three&nbsp;that come to mind are the&nbsp;magna guard star fighter, tank droids, and sith infiltrators. And I must add having this next to a magna guard star fighter is pretty cool.</p>

<p>The Figures:</p>

<p>While desirable the figures included seem lack luster, mainly due in my personal opinion to the out cry of fans wanting a phase II Cody figure. &nbsp;Hopefully that figure will come in the UCS Republic Gunship rumoured to&nbsp;release in May 2021. But the true order in ranking the figures goes... Obi-wan,&nbsp;good figure wrong set. Should have stay exclusive to the duel on mustafar set from earlier this year. The airborne clone trooper,&nbsp;really cool fig but again would prefer Cody in this set. And finally the highlight figure General Grievous as usual a great figure. no doubt in my mind that people who don&#39;t yet own this figure will by it just for him.&nbsp;but we&#39;ve had the same overall design for ten years now, so I look forward to LEGO updating the figure.</p>

<p>Final Statement (The Real Cost):</p>

<p>I enjoy this set even though it has flaws but its biggest is not one about build or figures. It is that price tag. $80.00 USD. Now to clarify I think this set is a better value than the sith Tie fighter from earlier this year. It is still a very tough pill to swallow. When you look at the set when it is complete your more likely to say why&#39;d I buy this for $80.00 when I could&#39;ve bought the hogwarts express for the same amount. Then ah yes this will make a fine addition to my collection. Overall score 2/5 a great set, with greedy intention.</p>
