I&rsquo;ve never been to Galaxy&rsquo;s Edge so I don&rsquo;t really know the &ldquo;official&rdquo; background story of this ship, but I love Star Wars vessels that aren&rsquo;t in main stream like the Falcon, or Tie fighters etc. After collecting for a few years, I&rsquo;ve really come to appreciate a ship in LEGO&nbsp;form never produced before.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Minifigures &ndash; 7/10</b> &ndash; Honestly it feels like there are only 2 minifigures in this set, with the droids not really fitting the character vibe. Vi&rsquo;s hairpiece is more of a gradient change from black to blue than the photos suggest here. She has 2 face prints and mine were significantly printed off center. Her torso is amazing with great detail and a hint of reflective printing. The legs are just ok on both figures. Lieutenant Bek is a nice headpiece and torso. Really appreciate getting another Alien in a rebel uniform. The Astromech has a First Order feel to it, great printing and color scheme. The GNK power droid is fine. Doesn&rsquo;t get me too excited, especially when you could just build one out of common spare parts from any old set you have lying around. For a $100 set with only 2 traditional minifigures you&rsquo;re left wishing for more in that area.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>The Build &ndash; 10/10</b> &ndash; The build has a lot of technic structure to provide a very supportive base to build off but I enjoyed how the bricks were incorporated so that it didn&rsquo;t feel like a hollow shell. Some sets it seems like you just cover up the technic pieces with plates at the end but this set integrates bricks, SNOT and technic building very well. It has something of everything which makes the build more enjoyable. I liked the fact that it really takes some time before you see the end build come to shape. The way the cockpit lid fits into place is smooth and the opening doors on the side feel very true to universe. There is more repetition in a set like this but with all those engines, you come to expect that.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Parts &ndash; 10/10</b> - The color scheme of light bluish grey and&nbsp;blue really fit well together. There are random white highlights on the ship that I personally don&rsquo;t care for as they seem out of place. The wide array of parts are well utilized and there are several that are just recently added to LEGO&#39;s arsenal. I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of technic building but this set does a good job of integrating those parts with more traditional bricks making it enjoyable. The finish tile pieces do a good job of giving the ship a textured and complete look.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Value &ndash; 8/10</b> &ndash; When you look at the part to price it&rsquo;s not far off on value. The biggest hit to the value is the lack of minifigures. I mean let&rsquo;s be real here $100 and you essentially get 2 characters, a droid and a brick build droid? I really feel like they should have included 2 more minifigures to make this price justifiable. The ship itself really holds up&nbsp;it&rsquo;s end of the deal. You won&rsquo;t be disappointed as it&rsquo;s a solid vessel with good shape. I understand these minifigures will probably be unique to this set alone, but I just can&rsquo;t say it&rsquo;s worth the price all the way around. Toss in 2 generic rebel troopers or a trooper and Nien Nunb and then it&rsquo;s a must have. I don&rsquo;t think the price needs to come down to complete the set the right way it just needs a few more figures.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b>Overall &ndash; 9/10</b> - &nbsp;I really liked the build, I love having a different variety when it comes to Star Wars ships. I hope they look to incorporate more from Galaxy&#39;s Edge, Fallen Order, Mandalorian and other not so main stream builds. This ship has great cargo space to put a few figures or crates in. Love the ramp/door system and the huge engines look great on the back end. The cockpit however is small and lacking detail. I feel like they could have put control tiles on the sides next to the seat to improve it. Overall the ship is great! Not a lot of stickers as the bricks tell the story. &nbsp;The minifigures that are included are pretty good. I don&rsquo;t think they are essential to any collection but unique to this set for sure. As I said if they would have added to the minifig selection it would be a hit. In the end this is a great build. I can&rsquo;t say that it&rsquo;s a must have because of the high price and only 2 traditional minifigures but worth it to expand your collection if you find it attractive like I did.</p>
