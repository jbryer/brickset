"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-05T09:29:55Z","Not bad","When I bought this, it was my first greater castle set in times. The figs are nice (but faces are to common) The jail is also nice, The tower with the sword is a bit strange, what's the meaning of it? The pieces are a good addition to a greater castle but it could have more little pieces. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-02T20:54:35Z","its... good","It was a pretty good set, but it lacked some qualities. I think it needed another guard, a guy trying to free Weezil and a skeleton. every set needs a skeleton or two... or three.... or four or five, six, seven  or even eighteen!!!",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2008-10-18T16:54:08.623Z","Beware of the falling axes","This set comes with two soldiers from two different factions. With them you can always start duel. The lion knight has a sword and the other soldier has a crossbow, but there are also other weapons in this set. There is that long silver sword, two spears and two big axes. With those weapons they can also fight, and the loser can be thrown into jail immediately after the duel.

The axes fall downwards without any problems. However, as someone has mentioned before, there is no way to block them and thus keep them from falling downwards if you don't want them to. That's pretty annoying, because a slight touch is already sufficient to trigger off the mechanism. 

Two nice elements are those two big bricks with a lion's head on them. They are a fine detail of this set though the bricks themselves are quite big. Apart from those bricks, there aren't many details. Quite many bulky bricks were used. If smaller bricks had been used, it would be easier to construct other models with the same bricks, and maybe these two buildings would also look a bit nicer. Even the baseplates are as thick as standard bricks. It would have been nicer if the two buildings had been put on plates. 

Still, it's quite a nice set to start with castle stuff. The falling axes and the prison cell allow you to go through several adventurous scenarios with the two soldiers. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-09-04T09:43:10.113Z","Prince of Thieves","This could so easily have been divided into two smaller sets, but it also works as one medium size one.  There are two buildings and two minifigs.

The more &quot;mundane&quot; of the two buildings is the jail with the working door and without a way to lock the door.  A barricade across the door or a chain of some sort would probably make it more realistic, look better and be more fun.  The top of the jail cell  is completed to be part of a tower.

The main &quot;tower&quot; seems to contain a guarded sword, drawing its influence from Arthurian myth perhaps.   There's not just one, but two traps for the unwary, although both are triggered together.  The falling boulder and the swinging axe can make mincemeat of anyone who's not able to avoid them in the nick of time.  The thing about this trap though is that there's no way to &quot;lock&quot; it, so it falls quite often during play, and usually when it's not supposed to.

The design of the two buildings are nice - the lion head bricks gives the sword room an interesting look while the crenalated roof of the jail gives it that grim and gritty look.  The tower above the sword room is small and is only a cut-away with the exception of the roof which gives it a nice little look.

One thing that is most often overlooked is that either one of the buildings can be used to replace the corner modules in the big castle 6091/6098 since they have the same sized baseplates/basebricks.  This play feature is not advertised anywhere on either of the sets.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-11T02:45:19.95Z","Love the jail door and the big castle parts","Good set fair value, love the little jail and the door. Two mini figures with weapons. I really like the lion head pieces and the big silver sword. Solid set to add to Knights or any Castle collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-19T10:29:12.173Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom I) - Guarded Treasure Review","This set is a great set to have in any LEGO collection. It comes with some rare lion head statues and two cool minifigs which you can add to your collection as well. We also get two buildings in one set. This set includes a jail where you can put the bad guys in and a tower which has a sword. If the bad guys are going to steal the sword you can kill them if you move the axes. You can also use this cool feature to drop a rock on the enemies as well. It's a great set to play with and it's fun to build as well.<br><br>All

"ClassicLegosAreBetter","2010-09-11T10:01:44.81Z","Guarded Treasury, but just how guarded is it?","<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Tower:</span> This was my very 
first Castle set that I got, and I remember thinking how tall this 
particular building was gonna be when I was about half-way done with 
it. Although it pales in comparison with the majestic heights of 6091 
King Leo's Castle or 10176 King's Castle, it still is quite an 
impressive structure. The falling axes and rock that guard the silvery 
sword is also a nice touch.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Jail:</span>
 This is a neat and nifty little building for putting in captured 
Cedric's Bull Knights. There aren't any other sets that has that feature
 in all the other Knights' Kingdom I<br> sets, so it is crucial to any good knights' war.<br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Minifigs:</span>
 Again as I built this set for the first time, I remember thinking how 
huge the helmets were (especially compared with town helmets) I was 
quite impressed. The minifigs here are amazing and a good match, but 
there is just one minifig for each army. If this is to be a ""Guarded"" 
Treasury there should at least be two of Leo's Lion Knights to guard the
 treasury. <br><br><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">The Overall:</span> I
 would give this set an 8 out of the box, simply because having just one
 Leo Lion Knight to defend this outpost against one Cedric Bull Knight 
doesn't seem quite right. But as far as nostalgic sets goes this one is 
definitely up there.",TRUE,4,4,4,4,4
