"A_Brickset_user","2004-04-17T03:01:35Z","ehhh","I own 2 of this set but my only intention for buying this is to get more barded horses. But like all of the bulls folk this bull guy sucks too. And the printing on the knights torsos are inadequate. Also black visor part doesnt look good on gray helmet part. All in all this is a set which makes me miss old lego castles.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-09-05T05:22:43.363Z","Royal Bull Watcher","This set seems to be for playing rather than building, because there is close to no building involved.  The design includes two knights on horses and a joust contraption with axes and a grandstand for the king.  The latter is the passive part of the set, the former the active.

The jousting axes thing on the turntable may seem interesting at first glance, but it doesn't really work too well when in play.  The design of the whole piece feels cluncky even with the lion heads added to the base.  The colours don't match, the pieces look out of place and it looks way too modern for a castle set.

The knights are nicely designed - black and red for the bull guy and blue, yellow and white for the lion guy, to match their respective logos.  The chains on the bull knight is a nice though, and the armour on both the horses, together with their different colours, makes it easier to differentiate them.

The grandstand is built of huge pieces and is overall very blocky.  Its use of a stained glass window (which is also used in the big castle 6091/6098) gives it a more interesting touch.  There's also the falling axes thing, supposedly to protect the king, but that is so badly built and is so flimsy that it would drop even when it's not supposed to.

Overall, the set seems nice from afar, but on closer inspection, particularly at the blockiness and the lack of building makes this set a little mediocre.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-11T02:50:14.793Z","Unique stain glass window issued only in this set","Two horses and three mini figures a plus. The joist mechanism does work but not all that well. More weapons for battle and some treasure chests. I thought it a bit over priced when I got it but with all the above mentionded things I guess it was fair.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"smiley905","2007-12-19T00:29:06.343Z","love this set","this set is great i realy like the mini figures and the horses. the wepons are cool and the dudes have cool armor. the kings little base is the reson i rated it a four, the axes are dumb the glass is kinda cool and its to big and blocky but other than that its a great set",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-09-06T10:20:28.403Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom I) - Royal Joust Review","This set is a very fun set and if I compare that to the LEGO Castle (Fantasy Era) set 7009 (The Final Joust) I've to say that this is the better set to get. It has more value than this set and one more minifig. This set includes two horses, a barrier which sviwels full 360Â° and a grandstand for the king. For some reason you can see on the cover of the instruction and of the box that there're two treasure chests but we only get one. And there're no gold coins in there just some translucent studs. The grandstand looks nice. I like the way how LEGO designed the lion head statues on the walls and I also like the window which is behind the seat of the king. It's a great little set to have and I like it more than set 7009 as I told you in the beginning.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
