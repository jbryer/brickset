Lego has made that task slightly easier by releasing this set. Set 76167: Iron Man Armoury has several advantages going for it as will be discussed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The box contains two bags, one instruction manual and one sticker sheet. It is easy and quick to build. The satisfaction of owning this set is that it makes a good playset or even a good display for AFOLs. Most of the elements contained within this set such as the hot rod, silver mk2 armour and even the drinking mug hint at scenes from the first Iron Man either when Tony is tinkering in his workshop or improving the mk1 armour to create the mk2 and mk3 version 2.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The first bag contains pieces to make two A.I.M. Agents, Tony Stark, the hot rod and a crate of &#39;Tony&#39;s Toys&#39;. A.I.M. Agents are&nbsp; the baddies here and both are identical. The Tony Stark minifigure head piece has some very subtle variations when compared with the head used on some previous sets such as 30167 which has the mk6 armour. The hot rod curiously seems to be receiving very little attention from reviewers. It is actually a brilliant little addition as it looks very similar to the &#39;32 Ford Roadster that Stark is working on in the beginning of Iron Man 1. It is nicely proportioned and increases play value. This is an important addition since Tony decides to add some red colour to the initial rendition of the fully gold mk3 that seemed to ostentatious. So we have this hot rod to thank for the red and gold colour scheme. Apart from that a cheeseburger is included (which Tony hankers for after escaping from his captives) and an empty crate. Actually I have a pretty good idea of what to put in the crate which I&#39;ll mention later.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The second bag contains pieces to make two armours, the armour holding bays and some accessories. Both armour face plates do not include the opening feature which reveals the wearer&#39;s face. While the feature was nice, the omission of said feature does make the helmet seem more proportionate now. The red armour has design elements from the cinematic universes mk50 and mk85 armours. The silver armour looks very similar to the mk2 armour seen in Iron Man 1. Four armour holding bays are provided which I&#39;m confident many fans will use to extend their hall of armours sets as they can be combined. Also worthy of mention are two tiny Iron Man &#39;nanofigures&#39; provided in this set. These seem unique here and are used in conjunction with what resembles a prototyping machine of some sort. In fact I have chosen to place the second nanofigure in the &#39;Tony&#39;s Toys&#39; crate thereby creating some purpose and backstory.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overall the build is quite simple as it&#39;s targeted towards the 7+ age category. However, Iron Man aficionados will have a good time identifying all the hints at the movies and building up their hall or armours. Only one&#39;s imagination limits the possibilities of this set. Definately worth investing in.<a href=""https://youtu.be/CTLKvGB6TM4"">My quick video review</a></p>
