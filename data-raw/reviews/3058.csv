"Novelty","2007-09-13T01:22:19.903Z","Bull's Eye!","The focus on action has never been greater than this set, which has at least 3 siege machines - a cannon with a target catapault, a catapault and a battering ram/siege tower combo.

The cannon combines all the good elements of the subtheme with a firing cannon, huge big brown wheels, chains and axes into a mean looking siege machine.  The only disappointment is that there are no attachment points for pulling/pushing the vehicle, but that's a minor quibble.  The whole thing is compact, nicely designed and looks nice.

The target tower on the other hand, seems rather basic and could have been better if it was incorporated into some sort of tower or structure, instead of the open frame thing that it is in the set.  Combining it to be a launcher of sorts when it is hit by the cannon seems a bit unproductive - why use the cannon to hit one of your own targets which then throws something at an enemy when you can aim the cannon directly?  The tower has been dressed up with flames and flags but it still looks empty.  This is probably the worst part of the set.

The smaller catapault is also rather basic and unembellished, but it works.  The handle could have been longer so that it's easier to manipulate.  The build is basic, and only a flag adorns the catapault.  Even in the promotional pictures, it's always to the rear and hidden from view.

The main thing of the set is the siege tower with an attached battering ram and prison cage.  The battering ram looks good, but is a bit flimsy and breaks after repeated play.  The cage is an interesting touch, however, the poles holding it in place can become easily dislodged in rough play.  Other than that those issues, the design is good and, embellished with chains, and horse heads and horns, it is the best looking part of the set.

The set also comes with a very well armed knight on horseback and 2 other soldiers to man the machines.  There's also a prisoner to go into the cage.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

cannon- the cannon fires far looks realy cool with the chains and sheilds and when you roll it the axes move up and down to clear the way

target catapoult- kinda dumb idea, i mean why not shust use the cannon and the catapult sepritly. i added a longer handle on to mine and use it like that. it doesnt even realy go that far if you do line it up with the cannon.

catapult- the catapult is ok, it fires about three feet and has ok aim, but it doesnt look that great from the front and is pretty emptie. but its easy to add decoration.

battering ram- this is the biggest and main part of the set. the wheels are the plain brown ones and it has six of them, its ram is ok, but unstable and doesnt look that great, the cage is cool and the bridge works well, the bridge is my favorite part.

ilike this set and is worth buying, it goes well with anycastle",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-03T04:22:06.837Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom I) - Bull's Attack Review","This set is a great set with lot's of play features in it. It's also great for army building and for minifigs. This set includes two catapults, a cannon which you can shoot to launch the catapult with the red base plate and a battering ram.<br><br>The battering ram looks much better than the one from the LEGO Castle - Fantasy Era theme (set: 7037). The bar can slide to the left and to the ride and you can also move it forwards and backwards. On the top of the battering ram is a platform which you can also slide forwards and backwards.<br>This vehicle also comes with a jail where you can lock up the enemies of the bad guys. There's a LEGO Technic bar on each side which you can use to lock the good guys up. It's a really fun build and there're also no stickers to worry about. I really can't complain about this set and the number of minifigs we get here.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
