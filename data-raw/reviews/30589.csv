<p><strong>Building experience</strong></p>

<p>The assembly was very simple, since it&#39;s just a minifigure and a couple of accessories.&nbsp;Took me half a minute.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>There isn&#39;t anything too special in terms of parts, except for Jay&#39;s hood piece, which only appeared in the expensive Land Bounty set. A pair of silver shurikens is also included.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>Obviously, the only minifigure included in this set is SotFs Jay. I am very happy that Jay is complete with his armour and nicely printed&nbsp;dual-moulded mask, which we don&#39;t see too often in cheap sets (looking at you, Lloyd&#39;s Journey). The minifigure itself looks really nice and I have no complaints about it. Jay also comes with a silver katana and a flail.</p>

<p><b>Conclusion</b></p>

<p>Overall, I really like this magazine gift. If you don&#39;t have this version of Jay, I strongly recommend this one. I paid 13.00PLN for it,&nbsp;(around 3 Euro), which is a fantastic price for what you get. However, if you already have this minifigure, you can easily pass on it.</p>
