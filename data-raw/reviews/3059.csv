(last part)

I made a review of this set before, now this is the second and last part. Before I said about the contents of the set, now this will review the buildings of the set. And some contents too, because some needs to be reviewed along with the building steps. This set was released in 1997 with the subtheme of Fright Knights, as the bigger castle of this subtheme, and maybe one of the tallest castles of the theme. 

Maybe you don't know why I made the review in different parts, but it is a better way to read it, and if you see in the building instructions, the building is separated by three parts, the tower, the entrance, and the back of the castle (that I call as main part), that keeps good the other parts. 

 - Minifigures
Starting the building, the first things are the minifigures. This have two soldiers that likes more archers, though only one of those have arrows on back. A different minifigure is a knight, that in some pictures rides a horse (A black one with a detailed barding and helmet), and the minifigure have a helmet included in important minifigures from the subtheme of Dragon knights, but this isn't complete and have plumes on the top. Have too the most known characters of the subtheme, Willa the witch and Basil the Bat Lord, with their completed details, (as example capes) and helmets (or the hat, in the case of the witch). Have too another horse (this is brown), and a black dragon, in the shape of the original dragon. The dragon by some people is considered as in minifigure schale, some not, but is unknown if it is or no. So, those contents are really useful for Lego scenery (they have yellow faces and looks like more the original minifigures, what makes them useful as castle or other types of minifigures), and of course, to the playability of the set or as army makers of the Fright Knights.

 - 1st floor of the tower
Starting the building steps of the castle, in a 8x8 brick (that is used as a plate), are added some red plates and some bricks on it, and too a wall made of two pieces, that if connected, can revolves to reveal the other side of it. Altough those pieces are a bit big, they have a good size to put the skeleton minifigure on one side and some contents on the other side, contents like a scroll and round bricks. Next to the wall have too slope pieces and simple bricks, that keeps well the size of the wall, so is added a plate above the two parts. 

 - 2nd floor of the tower
At the plate above, are added two 1x2 bricks with pins and a plate 2x2 with holes between them (this have two plates above). Above it more bricks and a technic plate are added, to fits a barrel (with a wand and a skull above it) closed with a crystal ball, what makes a really fun detail to the set. If you push the plates above the 2x2 plate, the wand will raises the skull don't being showed due to the barrel. Some panels and bricks are added around the feature of the skull, to put a plate above it.

 - 3rd floor of the tower
This floor have a bit less playability than the previous one, but is good to put minifigs inside. Panel wall corners are added and along with bricks and windows adds more feels of castle to the tower. In a wall of this floor are added plates with clips, where fits a spear of joust, where by more plates with clips makes the door of the prison, another stuff. To close the prision is easy, using a chain included in the set.

 - 4th floor of the tower
The other floor still with the style of castle, due to inverted slope pieces from the previous floor, and the normal ones to this, with a window in the center of it. All the slope pieces of this part of the tower are black, what makes it looks really cool. A double corner panel wall was used too in this floor, keeping the shape of the last one, and red inverted archs were used to finish one part of the tower. To finish the tower are added some embelishments like bats, and bricks above, keeping few defense to who stay in the last floor. And too a telescope, made very well to the set, that adds playability. 

 - 1st floor (Main Part)
Above a big brick, the building of this floor starts. It at the first point have only additions of simple bricks, but at the center, some bricks makes a throne (used as throne to the bat lord), and in the sides, doors (place to doors, but not exactly doors) and too walls, like the rotating ones. The pieces are well putted, like the slope pieces at the back, next to the doors, and too some pillars. Although bricks seem simple, with them is easy make great details, like in this set. As in this floor have four pillars, long archs connects them well, along with bricks. So the building keep strong to add plates above it, and too bricks, like the special parts of the castle turrets. 

 - 2nd floor (Main part)
At the 2nd floor of the main part, have a good place to a trap, made with two pieces, but works with more some pieces (including a technic axle size 3 with a stud), that don't takes a big place, what keeps a good space to minifigures. After that, as in the tower, are added some embelishments to the set, like the shields of the fright knights. 
 
 - Entrance
This part starts as the other part of the floor (the main part), by bricks and pillars. But this have bigger places to doors on the sides (they are placed in this part). Some contents like baskets and windows are added to the set, making this have more looking of a castle and giving of course, details. Going to the second floor, it have a similar building of the other part of the same floor, adding inverted archs plus inverted slope pieces, connecting to the pillars. This have too the panels in corners, being the same color as the others, it turns very useful in the set and in some castle sets. As in the entrance is needed a gate, so next to the pillars, have a good place to a bar piece 9x13 works as a gate, through big bricks with grooves. But the gate isn't putted yet, is needed more things to add. This part in the second floor have too another trap, but it isn't a pit, but a cauldron that releases round bricks. The gate have placed above a plate with clips and a chain on it, with a round brick in the other side. The round brick fits well through an arch piece, don't dismantling any part of the castle. And to raise the gate, is only needed pull the round brick above. If you want to keep locked the gate, you can put the round brick next to any stud near the gate. With some good contents (the flags in the entrance, one is from fright knights), so the building ends.

After the three parts, you can choose other modes to play with. With the Main part separated of the entrance and tower, with the open parts to play in the back, or with the main part and entrance together with the tower above the second floor of it, removing a green brick under it. The parts can be connected by plates. After the building is easy see entrances and open parts, that are considered as not good to defense, but it helps very the playability and design of the set, making different the part of the front in comparison with the back part, so I don't considered it as a con. The playability is a complete 5/5, and the minifigures are nice too.

About the availability, it is now rare, as it is eleven years old. So, if with box, instructions and more, it will be great to any collection. This have useful parts, nice playability, what makes this a good choice if you want a castle or increase one. The prices are very different, average of $90 to $200 in sites like bricklink. This in my opinion is close to be the best castle in it's category, a very great job that Lego made eleven years ago. 
Here are my Pros and Cons:
 -Pros:
Nice Minifigures;
Awesome playability;
Very Useful contents;
Great design;
Have great additions to Lego scenery;
Includes too complete versions of the main characters of Fright knights;
The box shows alternative models of building!
 -Cons:
The pillar pieces are so big, but though that, they still very useful to castle sets or other buildings, but the pillars could be made with more pieces instead of one, but it is only one con, so the pros makes this set be a five out of five.
 
 -Overall:
This set is a very good choice and very great in imagination, building, playability, design, it is a 5/5 by many reasons, I can't describe all details, but hope you enjoyed this review! (:",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

This castle is my absolute favorite lego set ever! i love the Fright Knight line, so their headquarters is my favorite set.

Lets start with the ground floor. The entrance, flanked by two bat shields, leads the way into the great hall. The hall can also be accessed by four other small entrances. inside the hall are racks for weapons, an ornate fire place, and a table with a crystal goblet on it, as well as Basil the Bat lord's throne. Behind the fire place is a hiding place for the skeleton.

The next floor up is kind of like the gate house. It has the mechanism for raising the gate, as well as a lever that can be pulled to drop a cauldron full of stones on enemies if they have gotten into the castle. There is even a table with a goblet on it for the general to lay maps out on and plan attacks. you can remove  a pin, which causes people standing at the table to fall in the great hall below. 

Next comes the tower. The first floor contains Lord Basil's potion laboratory, with another hiding place for the skeleton behind the potion shelf. The next floor up has Basil's chamber, with a mechanism that makes a skull appear inside a crystal ball.

the next floor contains the prison cell. it has barred windows, and a door, fastened by a chain. the cell even contains a sort of bench for prisoners. The next part of the tower is a treasure storage area, with a chest of gems. at the top of the tower is a telescope, for looking at the stars, and spying on enemies.

Included in the set is Basil the Bat Lord, with his cape, scepter/mace, and sword. It also contains, Willa the Witch, basil's advisor, and The well armed General of the Fright Knight army and his armored horse. Then there's Draco, Basil's pet dragon and sometime mount, and three soldiers, one with a spear, on a horse and one with a bow and arrow, plus a quiver. There's also a different more guard-like soldier, with a halberd and shield. Finally, no set is complete without an enemy, so the set also includes one of the Royal Knights, arch enemies of the fright knights. He's armed with a halberd so he can fight, but he can also be locked up inside the prison.


All in all, this set is, in my opinion, the best one ever made.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set originally came out back in the late 90's as part of the Fright Knight series. After the Dragon Knights and the introduction of dragons and Wizards, Lego continued to move in the direction of doing some fantasy based themes and sets. And this set is in my opinion, the pinnical of the Fright Knight theme.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You get a wide arrangement of minifigures. 7-8 if you cound the Skeleton, 2 horses and a Black Dragon. There's plenty do there with the Witch, Fright Knights and their lone Royal Knight Prisoner.</p>

<p>The build is just great, especially with the interior work. Particularly when the tower is examined. A printed scroll piece for the Witch's workshop, the floor above where she does scrying, and the very top where there's a telescope set up for seeing who's coming. There's just plenty to do here, for displays, play and various scenerios.</p>",TRUE,5,5,4,5,5
"Ernst","2014-01-21T17:02:17.52Z","Night Lord's Castle, a good fantasy Castle","<p><strong>Overall 4 bricks</strong>: This is a very nice set in this ""Fairy tale theme"". Not a very realistic Castle but that is in line of the theme. It is fun building it with a nice result with several traps and more than one way to attach the modules. A pity you get only Knights from one faction, not counting the captured Royal Knight, some others to release him would have been welcome. A nice set for a collector, a good set if you want to use the parts for MOC's and great set for kids to play with and if you buy it used still affordable.</p><p><strong>Building 4 bricks</strong>: Not a very difficult built compared with both older and newer sets. You start with the 5 floor&nbsp;tower; first floor with potions and the Magic Book, second floor with the scary skull in the Crystal ball, third floor the treasure room, fourth floor the prison and fifth and top floor with a telescope. A bit weird in a mediëval set ..... After that the front part of the Castle with a front fence and left and right side 2 doors. The rear side on both sides open parts in the walls, a fire place with on the other side a skeleton and on the first floor again a trap.</p><p><strong>Parts&nbsp;4 bricks</strong>: A huge load of very usefull Castle bricks&nbsp;like a lot of slopes, 4 doors, one rare wall part <a href=""http://www.bricklink.com/catalogItem.asp?P=30100"">30100</a>&nbsp;and the 8 big arches.

"Fauch","2014-11-27T20:07:24.82Z","Great castle","<p>Parts</p>

<p>That&#39;s the only lego castle I own so far, so I&#39;m not too sure, there are many nice big pieces, but they may be common in castle sets. The ones which come out are probably the dragon and 6 huge columns. It also comes with 2 swivel doors / walls which is nice.</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>Maybe a low point of this set, though the minifigs are good for 1997, there are only&nbsp;8 of them and the castle look a bit empty. The bat lord is great but was a very common minifigs (I own more bat lords than any other lego figures ever made) and most of the soldiers look&nbsp;quite basic, though the one with the dragon helmet is great and comes with a great horse as well.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>From what I remember this is a quite simple build, and not very long for a set this big. it is quite fun to see it grow taller and taller. Maybe a bit more caution should be used when building the tower.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Awesome, it towers most others models and has quite an impressive, possibly intimidating look. On the minus side, it must be hard to defend since it has doors on all sides. also, whereas the exterior and the tower have good details, the indoor is pretty bare. Can&#39;t say much about the price, I got it a long time ago, and at a discount (possibly half the price) so it was a really good deal.</p>

"Heliatck","2020-03-21T16:14:59.9Z","Not the prettiest castle, but plenty of good parts","<h2>Intro</h2>

<p>The wacky Fright Knights theme has a bad reputation among most castle lovers. That&#39;s perfectly understandable when you compare the sets in this line to those of the factions such as the Crusaders, Black Knights or even the Royal Knights.</p>

<p>I do think there are some truly terrible sets such as 6037 and 6087 and even though 6097 the Night Lord&#39;s Castle is not the prettiest castle either I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a terrible set.</p>

<h2>Main Build</h2>

<p>There are some weird things about this set, such as the huge brick plates that are being used instead of a regular or raised baseplate. The main build consists of a tall tower, standing on a raised platform. Black pillars are used to elevate the platform, which is a neat idea, but it makes the building look very open. The main tower is also a weird structure. Each level uses a completely different style, which makes the whole tower look like a jumbled mess. The fact that yellow and red details are being used throughout doesn&#39;t help either. Like I said, it&#39;s not exactly pretty. There is also a wall surrounding the main building, though it has openings everywhere which kind of defeats the purpose of having a wall in the first place.</p>

<p>That said, I do think kids could have a lot of fun with this set. There are a lot of play features and the castle would be easy to modify.</p>

<h2>Parts</h2>

<p>So what&#39;s good about this set? Well, it has a lot of great parts. There&#39;s a surprising amount of regular light grey and black bricks and arches, which can be used for other castle builds. There are some rare dark grey panel pieces and trap doors as well. Obviously there are the black pillars. These can be used as chimneys, masts or as a way to add detail to a wall. Even the brick plates can be very handy if you want to create a big structure. They are also very easy to combine with Duplo pieces, for example to create a mountain/hill. There&#39;s smaller parts as well, such as the crystal ball, a cauldron, some chains and also the nice lattice pieces.</p>

<p>There are a total of 7 minifigures plus a skeleton, a black dragon and two horses in this set. You get plenty of accesories such as bows, spears and also a chrome silver sword.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>All in all I think this set is great for Castle lovers that want to make their own creations. Don&#39;t be fooled by the ugly looking building and the bad rep of Fright Knights: this is one of the best Castle parts packs out there.</p>
