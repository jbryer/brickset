"A_Brickset_user","2005-04-19T03:02:28Z","It looks great from the front (only)","When I first saw it on the 2001 catalogue, I was totally amazed by its look. I managed to get one last year (2004). After building it, I was a bit disappointed. It looks great from the front but not from other sides.

Personally, I like the new grey colours (starting from year 2004). So, this set looks a bit dull-in-colour when it is put beside the Castle of Morcia.

However, i really like the silver sword and the horse.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-15T10:00:43.623Z","Animal Kingdom","This is the largest Knights Kingdom set, and like all castle sets, it comprises of the biggest castle of the subtheme.  It appears big partially due to the fact that it sits on a raised baseplate.  It is also because of this raised baseplate that a ramp/drawbridge is required to access the castle.  Thanks to the height of the entryway, the ramp can only be so long (or short in this case) which results in a rather steep climb to the castle.

The main part of the castle consist of the throne room.  This part fo the building, and the four adjacent buildings all adhere to the standard Knights Kingdom colour scheme of grey/black walls, tan highlights and blue roofs.  The main throne room has a cloth backdrop instead of a wall, probably to reduce pieces and building time.  This gives the castle a weird look when viewed from the back.  The throne room, however looks nice from the front.  Above the throne room is a small room with a stained glass window and a balcony, and above that is a small tower and battlements.

The four buildings at the corners are not only modular, but they are interchangable as well - interchangable with each other and with the 2 buildings from 6094 - to change the look of the castle as and when required.  Three of the buildings included with this set is rather mundane - battlements, a 2 storey building with the compulsory catapault, and a 2 storey jail cell and tower.  The fourth building consists of a hidden lever with the treasure chest on top such that when the lever is depressed... say when fired upon, the treasure chests fly out of the castle.  Why anyone would place a treasure chest on the roof on the periphery of the castle is beyond comprehension.  It would have been better if it was a pile of rocks or something.

For extra play value, there's a siege machine with the spring loaded missile launcher.  Again, nothing special there.  The set is kitted out with a whole lot of minifigs, including a maiden and a skeleton.  There's still room for improvement for this set, but as it is, it works fine.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"OWF","2008-08-07T06:35:00.107Z","Something special","As castle, it isn't such a big one and it doesn't have a good defending.
Comparing with old castles, this one has some big pieces and I think this is a disadvantage.
As someone else already said, there are too many holes for enemies to enter the castle and the back side is really bad because there's too empty.
When I've built it for the first time I was wondered about empty back and I had to use some old pieces from my different sets to build a balcony and to improve his structure.
Over all I think this is the most beautiful castle from all time because of   strained-glass window, balista, and all minifigs are really special comparing with from other castles.
King Leo is the most beautiful king from all Lego kings, and also Princess Eleonora is the most beautiful princess from all princesses.
This set it's not the best for someone who wants to play a lot, but it's for sure the best chose for someone who wants to have some special pieces and to find all in one single set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-24T16:28:58.577Z","Great for anyone, a true castle","Maybe not the oldest, or the most classic, but this is a great castle! I got this for christmas (and I have no clue which version I have...) a while back and still have it now!

The set is loaded through and through with playability, from invaders (two of them) to defenders, this is a great set to have battles with, especially if you have more of the sets from the series...

The seige cart has tools for the warriors, including spears and shields and a missile launcher. The cart also serves as a battering ram. Since the cart's wheels come off easily when pulled by the builder (purposely of course...) that adds to the playability, since hitting a wooden whell with stone shot from a catapult would deal plenty of damage to it...

The castle itself is divided into seven sections, I will rate each one.

1- the base: this includes the drawbridge (so cool), and the designs all around it. The designs around the base (arches, swords, torches, and so on...) are really cool and add a nice touch since a knight can easily reach up and grab a longsword to do battle. The shiny swords look really, really cool and the whole exterior adds a medeival, akmost European castle feel. (especially with the cobblestone bricks)

2- the main hall- The tapestry makes up for the lack of a back wall, but still... The throne has the fortunes hidden underneath, which adds to the playability even more. The dropiing drawbridge is also a nice touch, since it quickly comes crashing down, no slow suspensefull cranking. The front has plenty of awesome details, and the whole thing looks visually spectacular. The lack of a back wall also allows the builder to flip the castle and perform an epic final battle.

***Please note:(all views are using the gate as SOUTH)***

3- Northwest turret: possibly my favorite turret, since it houses the &quot;axes of doom&quot;! Any unsuspecting raider faces certain peril should they attempt to grab the (false) jewel, while the true fortune is in the throne. The tower also has a spire.

4- Northeast turret: my second favorite, the catapult turret, with launching action. The rotating pillar can also serve as an alcove for a knight who abrubtly attacks when the castle is under assault. Why this includes a skeleton, I'll never know... The turret spins and has a long range, to both the enemy and your siblings...

5- Southwest turret: This turret is okay, but doesn't work that well. The turret is supposed to serve as a post and a target. Enemy seiges will find that hitting the main pillar causes an empty treasure chest to rain upon them (and in real life those things are HEAVY!), but don't get your hopes up, the target is hard to hit, and sometimes doesn't respond due to being too tight!

6- Southeast turret: this turret doesn't have much, but is not lacking. It seves as a lookout for enemy attacks, by visual or by hawk, sent by the knight.

7- Central Turret: The final level of the castle, this is the room for the princess/queen (your choice, she's important either way) and has more than expected. Though there is not much detail, the room has plenty of playability, since the princess fits right in the window...
The room also has a stained glass window for the dramatic entrance of either her savior or captor (or both to be comical...)

All in all a really great, really big, really cool castle to be reckoned with.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"KLOKRIECHER","2011-10-02T07:26:40.353Z","LEGO Castle (Knights' Kingdom I) - King Leo's Castle Review","This castle is one of my favourite castles I've built so far. It has some cool minifigs and some great play features and we also don't get any stickers to worry about. The baseplate is the same piece we've seen in the Rock Raiders HQ set - except for the color and markings on it. I like the way how LEGO did the cannon for the bad guys. It's the only vehicle for them in this set. There's also a tower with a treasure chest on the top. If the cannon of the bad guys hit the wall the treasure chest is going to fly away. Behind this tower you can see another tower with some axes which can be used to kill the enemies if they want to get the gem.<br><br>On the other side of the castle is a catapult which sviwels full 360Â°. In front of that tower is a platform where the guards can patrol. On the middle of the building you can see a ramp which you can move up and down and there's also a big gate which you can drop or lock up if you sviwel the flag. Behind the gate you can see a throne where you can hide some gold and behind the throne is a huge flag as well. On the top of that throne room you can see a room for the princess but there's nothing much going on there. It's a great set to have and it has lot's of cool play features for sure. I really can't complain about this model and the number of minifigs we get here.<br><br>All
in all this set is an great set and I would HIGHLY recommend you to get
this. You can find this set on eBay, BrickLink and Amazon for sure.
