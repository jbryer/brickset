The set comes with plenty of soldiers and a prisoner along with the evil batlord riding on his horse.  I love the idea that the set is pulled by a dragon in stead of a couple horses or whatever.  overall this set is great and you should consider getting it.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-11T03:18:03.06Z","Cool Set ","This is my favorite Fright Knight set by far. It has a black dragon pulling a portable jail. The dudes in the set are great, like the whip-dragons can be stubborn at times. Enjoyable to build and it has alot of playability. Conclusion Awesome set.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-07-16T05:43:59.7Z","Dragon Tales","This is probably the best looking prisoner transport wagon in the entire Castle line before the new millinium, and probably after as well.  The architecture of the wagon part makes it looks more like a small house on wheels than a normal wagon.  It's embellished with flames and wings and chains.  There's also space for the charioteer to sit.  Unlike the other prisoner wagons, this one is pulled by a dragon, again, another interesting touch.  Accompanying the set is a knight on horseback and a prisoner which gives this set quite a bit of play value.  This set is perhaps the one bright spot in the otherwise horrible subtheme of Fright Knights.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
