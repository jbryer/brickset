<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Packaging</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">A very nice looking package for a LEGO Store exclusive. Shows off the set very nicely and the great characters inside. The back even shows of even more fun things you can do with the set while playing with it. Unlike previous years there isn&rsquo;t any name plaque printed on the box when giving this set away as a gift, but that&rsquo;s fine.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The manual in this set is packaged carefully so as to avoid bending or creasing and includes easy to follow along steps for the build. Unlike past LEGO Vignette sets there is no imagery on the back revealing the next set in the line, possibly because these sets were a bit of a surprise to us considering all of the BrickHeadz they&rsquo;ve been making the past few years.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Parts</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This sets most unique elements are the Minifigure parts, some 1x2 yellow hay bricks, the ridged kind with the sculpted detail work and some dark reddish brown 1x1x2 headlight bricks used mostly in BrickHeadz based sets. For a small Brand Holiday Vignette set that&rsquo;s pretty much it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Minifigures</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Driver: This costume clad farmer is dressed as a creepy looking mummy, complete with brand new torso printed with wrappings on front and back and a head covered in wrappings as well, his face is hidden but plainly visible as an ordinary farmer with a rich brown moustache and a gritted tooth expression for scaring children. Or bad Mummy impressions, you decide. No hand held accessories included.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Kid: This little girl is dressed in a dark black hoodie with LEGO skeleton torso painted over it, the extent of her costume apparently, perhaps she could not afford a full costume. Her face includes a happy tooth filled smile and a terrified, o-mouth open scream. Included with her is the Pumpkin Jack-O-Lantern head piece which can double as a candy carrying container for Trick-Or-Treat or an alternate mask she can wear to Trick somebody who doesn&rsquo;t give her any Treats. Very cute and some great new elements in the set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Skeleton: This LEGO Skeleton is standard with the same basic build we&rsquo;ve seen since&hellip; wow, has it almost been twenty years since LEGO introduced the clip-arms to their original Skeleton Minifigure design? Or maybe ten years? I feel this was introduced in 2011 or so when Ninjago first started out and the Skulkin armies used new Skeleton torsos with clips for the arms instead of the wobbly loose original Skeleton design of the late 90s. Either way it&rsquo;s been going strong and doesn&rsquo;t look to have any major re-designs coming up anytime soon.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The build</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This was a simple and quick build, for the most part, a sticker sheet is included instead of printed tiles, so you will need to apply stickers for the sign, the side of the trailer with the wooden slats and some detailing for the tractor. Overall though the build is pretty straight forward, something a bit different from other Holiday Vignettes. Personally I enjoyed it.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">The completed model</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">This set has two separate models, the Tractor with Trailer and then a large Sign showing the entrance to what could be a Corn Field Maze. Both of these models are very well designed, the large sign has a very clever pumpkin design with it and looks great. The only issue with it is the use of stickers for the detailing instead of printed tiles.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">The Tractor includes a towable trailer and is a nice little build with dark reddish brown elements and some additional stickers used to make the thing look suitably Halloween themed. The trailer is loaded with hay bales and a pumpkin (brick-built, not Jack-O-Lantern head piece), which is very cute and looks suitably appropriate for the holiday.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Overall this set does a pretty decent job and looks great next to past Halloween Vignette style builds. Love the overall design behind this set.</p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px""><b><span style=""letter-spacing:-.55pt"">Overall opinion</span></b></p>

<p style=""margin-bottom:11px"">Very well put together, this little set is a must have and I wholeheartedly recommend it. The Minifigures are nice and suitably impressive, the models work great for a yearly Halloween display with past sets in the line and the inclusion of a bay and medium tan/nougat looking spider element are suitably creepy. Highly recommended for the upcoming holiday season.</p>
