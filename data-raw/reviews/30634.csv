The&nbsp;legendary&nbsp;Monkey King is the main character&nbsp;from the classic Chinese novel, in which he along with some of his closest comrades conquers&nbsp;evils and helps retrieve Buddhist sutras.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set consists of 175 pieces, and has&nbsp;some exclusive pieces; including&nbsp;the new pearl gold&nbsp;1&times;1 rounded eye tiles,&nbsp;gold lacquered&nbsp;pieces that are used for the&nbsp;shoulder pads and the ends of the staff, and the front printed shirt piece.The color scheme of this set&nbsp;blends together to provide a stunning royal look to the Monkey King. The yellow/orange outfit highlights the reddish brown head of the Monkey King. &nbsp;As with all other Brickheadz, the playability is limited. &nbsp;These sets are mostly for display. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this set is a must-have for Brickheadz enthusiasts. I believe this set will become a classic one day. &nbsp;</p>
