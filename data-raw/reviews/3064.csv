"Blade","2007-09-04T12:18:03.91Z","A Real Shocker","First to review this one, that is a real surprise. This particular set makes me laugh. It was made in 98, two years after the last Aquazone model, but he is still called an Aquashark. But this is when the new series started so shouldn't he be a Stingray? No he has a shark on his chest. But then why dose this model look like such a half breed of the Sharks and Nauts? Let me explain further.

The vehicle is black with yellow and blue which were Aquanaut colours, the sharks had orange, not yellow, so he must be an Aquanaut. But his flippers are black and he has spears, so going by previous models he must be a shark. But he has a yellow oxygen tank, which makes him a Naut, but all the Nauts and Sharks and the Hydros that I have all have full jacket. The base of the vehicle is pretty solid so he must be a Hydro but he is obviously baddie so he is a Shark. But aren't they called Stingrays...

As you can see its like chasing your tail. I think this guy is a real oddity and really looks out of place with both groups. The vehicle itself is ok, a real thick base, has space for flippers at front, defensive arrows, controls and a small propeller at the back.

Mini-fig has Sharks shirt, blue pants, fluoro yellow hook, bearded face, standard grey helmet and fluoro blue visor.

Overall im not really sure what to say because im in two frames of mind. One is it's just weird and annoying. Two is its still a LEGO model. Look, honestly it deserves a one but its getting a 4/10 from a LEGO point of view as it has no aesthetics no playability, doesn't fit into any set. The only real point to have this model is to say &quot;I have model 6100&quot; or for the fig and maybe a few pieces. Sorry if the truth hurts.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

Nothing outstanding about it, you get a diver with all the stuff he needs to get around underwater. For the price just one more set for the collection. Fits in nicely with other underwater themes in my collection. ",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

<p>It isn&#39;t overly special, but it costs very little, and his hand is florescent. Something to pick up if only for that latter point.&nbsp;</p>
