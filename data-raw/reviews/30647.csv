"mini_mads1980","2021-01-06T12:29:58.777Z","Too Similar to Older Comic Sets","<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>The third diver to come with the Lego City Comic is attached to Issue 29, with a UK price of &pound;4.25.&nbsp; Previous divers we have got have come with issues 3 and 16 and were priced slightly better (&pound;0.26 increase here is not much of a change in a year&#39;s worth of issues since the last one).</p>

<p>This set also gives you a shark, making it very similar to <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/951703-1/Diver-and-shark"">951703</a> from Issue 3.&nbsp; I don&#39;t have a review for the first diver we got, however my review for <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/951906-1/Diver"">951906</a> resulted in a three-star score.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The packet, attached to the comic by a piece of sticky tape, is the large foil pack that the comics currently use.&nbsp; Larry is pictured well with his camera pointed to the front and the shark swimming in the background ready to take a bite.&nbsp; Bubbles and a bit of sea plant complete the underwater element of the picture, and you can just about make out a sunken boat that Larry may want to investigate.&nbsp; The top right has a sunny looking island in the background.</p>

<p>On the back the 1:1 image this time is of one of the black flippers that Larry is wearing.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Initially I am disappointed with this Minifigure, as his torso and legs are exactly the same as Tommy Tube in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/951906-1/Diver"">951906</a>, that came with Issue 16.&nbsp; Add to that that none of the 2020 sets use this colour scheme for the divers, it feels very much like Lego are just using up surplus pieces.</p>

<p>Also, it would have been good to have been given a female diver as the last two comic ones were male.&nbsp; So far in 29 issues, two of which have had two Minifigures, we have only been given two female Minifigures who were both in weaker sets.&nbsp; A look at the back of the comic shows that the next one is male too!</p>

<p>The head element is only printed on one side, however his torso is printed on both and the detail is great for a diver.</p>

<p>Larry is made up of the following parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Helmet - White Mini Crash Helmet [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4298609/mini-crash-helmet"">4298609</a>]</li>
	<li>Visor - Transparent Light Blue Divers Mask [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6244761/divers-mask"">6244761</a>]</li>
	<li>Head - Bright Yellow [Can&#39;t find exact matching part!]</li>
	<li>Air Tank - White Mini Oxygen Bottles[<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6268849"">6268849</a>]</li>
	<li>Torso - Black Mini Upper Part No 3785 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6182771/mini-upper-part-no-3785"">6182771</a>] (printed on both sides)</li>
	<li>Legs - Black Mini Body Lower Part [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/9339/mini-body-lower-part-black"">9339</a>]</li>
	<li>Flippers - Black Frogmans Foot [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6172936/frogmans-foot"">6172936</a>]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Main Build/Parts</h3>

<p>You don&#39;t get anything to build with this set other than Larry and a Shark.&nbsp; You do get to put a transparent round tile on a bright yellowish green camera, but that is not going to tax you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If the parts were different to previous I would probably have liked this more, but as stated above it&#39;s too similar.&nbsp; I would have liked one of the new sand blue sharks with the hammer head rather than the dark stone grey ones that I have loads of.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>This is not the best Lego City Comic set.&nbsp; If you don&#39;t have older issues then you are likely to enjoy it more than me, but I just think it needed to be different from previous more than it actually is.&nbsp; I don&#39;t think it fits with the 2020 City sets as those&nbsp;divers wear red.</p>

<p>Inclusion of different sea life would have improved this - maybe one of the newer pieces like the stingray.&nbsp; They maybe could have had a simple cage build for the diver to be in while photgraphing the shark?</p>

<p>The next issue comes with a jet ski, which keeps up the ocean theme from this issue.</p>

"Adameus","2021-12-31T21:53:43.303Z","Nice suplement, but basically a copy of previous divers","<p>First of all, it is only a minifig, nothing much to say about the build nor parts. Only interesting part is the green camera, which is sort of rare. It is just bad compared to the other diver magazine promotions. The best thing this set can do is to be a supplement, and it looks nice on a shelf, especially with the 2020 deep sea sets.</p>
