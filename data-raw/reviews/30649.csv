"Legoman1001","2022-02-24T13:02:32.327Z","A mini-Classic set done right","<p>I really like this set, everything is oriented around a domestic scene which is appropriate to Ikea and goes along with the origins of Lego.&nbsp;Along those lines you also get the classic smiley minifigs which is what hooked me in the first place, along with the basic legs and torso which is a welcome relief from minifigs with overabundant &quot;personality.&quot;</p>

<p>In my mind this is what a Classic set should be: colours and pieces based around a domestic scene first and foremost. All of the colours and pieces can easily find a purpose during free building,&nbsp;none of them are too odd&nbsp;or niche. The ratio of pieces: windows, minifig accessories, bricks and plates is&nbsp;well-balanced for&nbsp;lots of possibilities.</p>

<p>Being only 200 pieces, it&#39;s obviously limited, but it&#39;s great for what it is and not too pricey.</p>
