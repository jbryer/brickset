"Gus_263","2008-04-21T11:41:37.717Z","The classic castle minifigure pack","This set was released in the year of 1985, in the castle theme. So, it includes some minifigures with characteristics of the classic castle theme. The six minifigures are from the black falcons or the lion knights, making some additions to the army of these. There are three lion knights, these are basic and simple designed, but it still cool due to the color schemes and classic Lego style. Each of these three lion knights looks like to be the same, but it makes a good effect for the army, and it looks like to be more original from Lego. The lion knights features red, blue and black schemes (the black are on details, and also the yellow, in the skin, and in the symbol of the lion). The lion knights includes two shields, two helmets, and another with different shape, also a axe and a longbow. The knights that features the blue, white and black colors are the original black falcon knights. The three of this army are also, basically, the same. But these have three helmets (one with a different shape), two shields, one longbow, one axe and spear. These original knights increased with weapons, shields and helmets are additions to any castle army, and were cheap in that times, because now are rarities. In comparison with other minifigure packs, it gets a 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"SiaFu","2012-12-12T11:08:47.767Z","Way before battle packs","This was my first LEGO set, and the first one I ever saw.<br>The minifigs were a marvel compared to other toys regarding their articulation, the quality of insignia printing and supplied weapons/accessories. And minifigs are what this set is all about - 6 knights, 3 vs 3, almost fairly matched (archer and battle-axe on each side, leaving sword vs spear). Four different shields and different torso prints that allow individuality while clearly distinguishing the Lions and the Falcons. No filler parts or scenery you might not want, just the battle-ready minifig troops.<br>Simple to build, and duplicate sets are not an issue as you can swap the pieces around if you don't want uniformity for your troops.<br>
<br>Too bad there aren't modern LEGO Castle sets like this. It's either one minifig plus some accessories and scenery or a pre-built blister pack with a comparatively bigger price than this set had back in the '80s (when each minifig was worth about four unpainted 1:72 Italieri miniature soldiers).<br>",TRUE,5,4,4,5,5
"Niki124","2023-02-19T19:39:47.893Z","Very useful addition","<p>One thing I liked about Castle Minifigures is that there are more unique figures than you may think, despite everyone looking like a coherently-dressed army. This set is a nice showcase of the different styles used, and of the variety of weapons which came as accessories with these sets at the time. The only issue I recall is that the larger bell-shaped helmets had a tendency to come away easily, they would often get caught on something along the edge.&nbsp;</p>
