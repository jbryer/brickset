<p>The NES itself with it&#39;s working cartridge slot and very iconic easter egg was only the start of the enjoyment this set brings. Altrough the NES is smaller than the real device, which is most notable with the cartridge it still feels as the real thing.</p>

<p>The TV is another masterpiece and such a great addition to the whole set. It is a little small compared to the NES, but hey, TV&#39;s in the past are tiny compared to our TV&#39;s right now.</p>

<p>The build was great. Altrough building the level by it&#39;s nature is repetitive the overall build was not. Due the usage of all kinds of different techniques you are always curious what you will build next and how it all fits together. The Mario figure I find okay, it somehow seems a little out of place, but with the scale I don&#39;t know how it could be done better.</p>

<p>It&#39;s one of the best LEGO sets I have build.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To summarize:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Great design, very true to the original</li>
	<li>Build is very fun to do with all the different techniques</li>
	<li>Iconic easter egg</li>
	<li>TV is somewhat small</li>
	<li>Mario itself looks a little out of place</li>

<p>The Nintendo Entertainment was a very popular video game console released in 1985. I wasn&#39;t even born when this was out for the public. Yet Nintendo of Japan did release the Family Computer (Famicom) in 1983. Using cartridges, you could play many games such as the classics like Super Mario Bros. Third-party developers also had classics like Mega Man and Ducktales from Capcom, Jackal and Castlevania from Konami and even Sunsoft had a nice version of the 1989&#39;s Batman with its own storyline yet felt like the closest to a proper Batman game before Arkham Asylum in 2009.</p>

<p>The NES arrived when the gaming market was at its lowest following the fall of the industry in 1983 when the market was overflowing with consoles, games and multiple releases including the infamous E.T. Today, the industry is in a mixed bag situation with overflowing games, new console releases on five, six or seven years cycle and an ever-growing market with personal computers supporting much higher definition, graphical fidelity and framerate as well as multiple controller support if preferred over the mouse and keyboard.</p>

<p>Nintendo specialises in strong unique brands with colorful and mysterious characters. From the charming worlds of Super Mario Bros., the ever-wonderous landscapes of The Legend of Zelda, the cavernous deeps of Metroid and the glorious jungles and forests of Donkey Kong Country. Mario, originally known as Jumpman, is perhaps the single, most recgonizable character in the video game industry thanks to his mustache, italian accent and his apparels down to having the most iconic cap of all time.</p>

<p>Super Mario Bros., as you may know, was one of the first traditional 2D side-scrolling platformer. You had to move Mario from left to right in order to traverse different levels and obstacles such as enemies, bottomless pits and environmental hazards. While the series has expanded to include larger levels, the original stands as the foundation of basic video game design.</p>

<h3>Before the construction...</h3>

<p>I unfortunately couldn&#39;t pick it up at my local LEGO Store as all sets were out of stock. I eventually decided to order it online and, to my surprise (maybe I shouldn&#39;t be), it became out of stock a few days later. I received the package on August 10th in relatively nice condition with the gift-with-purchase Super Mushroom expansion set. The box itself was heavy as expected. However, I&#39;m a bit shocked that they didn&#39;t do a similar thing than the Star Wars UCS sets on the white box to represent the silhouette of the actual product. You may think this is just for Star Wars but LEGO did it for the 1989 Batmobile, one set I couldn&#39;t pass on because it was indeed a wonderful toy.</p>

<p>With more than 21 numbered bags and some loose parts consisting of the controller cable, the antenna and the base for the NES console, that&#39;s a lot of stuff. However, some bags only include very specific portions of the set to allow the main playable feature to function which is the rotating display of Super Mario Bros.</p>

<h3>Oh dear, you went missing...</h3>

<p>While I did contact LEGO, I have to inform you that I did have a missing piece, one of two-by-one medium&nbsp;blue tile that consists of the sky. This is extremely unfortunate and shouldn&#39;t a thing I expect from LEGO. The missing piece was in fact in the correct shape for it but it was light-grey which is obviously the wrong color for the skybox. Before publishing the review, I did request to receive the missing piece. At the time of publishing, my set is now complete.</p>

<h3>The instructions book</h3>

<p>To be honest, I&#39;m split when it comes to the idea of having two instructions books for such a display piece. I didn&#39;t like it when I built The Tumbler back in 2014 yet all of my following sets did have a single book or booklet. However, I can understand they wanted to make this experience like a 2-player cooperation build and it does the trick as I&#39;ve watched Nintendo fans on stream building the set. It&#39;s also pretty nice to get some info regarding the design and history of Nintendo itself. Seeing the different franchises may say that LEGO is opening the door for future Nintendo collaborations, who knows.</p>

<h3>The construction</h3>

<p>Much like the Star Wars UCS/Master Builder sets, Creator Expert or the 1989 Batmobile, the LEGO NES is quite the experience. From building the core mechanism that makes the console features work to the retro TV that also stands out on its own, you&#39;ll find some really clever design and techniques that you should experiment by yourself if you have the opportunity. While the cartridge is the most simple, the controller was a bit difficult due to the cable being difficult to place with one of the small pieces that holds both extremities as intended.</p>

<p>Repetition is something you have to accept when building the game display due to the amount of small square studs, tiles and printed pieces. Some of the other elements are also original such as the speaker, the channel knob and the back of the TV itself as it feels like an actual retro TV.</p>

<h3>The complete model</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s forget the size of the LEGO NES because the compromise done to get the shape is alright. The end result is phenomenal in terms of functions, authenticity and display. From afar, you would believe this is a clean NES until you see the oversized buttons on the controller that is, actually, the same size as the original controller which is great. I cannot comment on the LEGO Super Mario playable figure as I do not own the starter pack. However, the mechanism to rotate and make the game work on the TV is definitely a nice feature that brings back the memory of going all the way to the right! While it doesn&#39;t truly represent any specific level, it is for sure a nice reproduction of what you would get in the original software.</p>

<h3>So... no minifigs?</h3>

<p>There are obviously no minifigs in this set but I can actually appreciate the printed piece for Super Mario that is shaped to perfection and will become a unique piece on its own. It does feel like it could be a minifig, but that&#39;s not the case.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The LEGO Nintendo Entertainment has some of the best playable features out of a display model apart from the Pirates of Barracuda Bay. With the possibility of placing the cartridge into the console and mimicking the idea of playing the game thanks to the TV, this is a set that will appeal to anybody that has a bit of nostalgia with Nintendo. The designers were definitely fans of the brand and I can only hope Nintendo gave them all the necessary tools to design sets from other franchises such as The Legend of Zelda, Star Fox, Metroid and Kirby.</p>

The&nbsp;original Nintendo system&nbsp;and a tube television has been perfectly recreated. This includes a game cartridge. You turn the crank and Mario starts his trek across the screen. This is an interesting build and the result is truly amazing. I would highly recommend this set that is priced right.</p>
",TRUE,5,5,5,5,5
"ra226","2020-10-10T03:36:20.67Z","The Princess is Definitely in This Castle","<p>This is possibly the most nostalgia-laden set Lego has ever produced--and I say that as an owner of the fantastic Benny&#39;s Spaceship and a Classic Space fan of over 40 years.&nbsp; But if I wasn&#39;t building Lego in the 80&#39;s, I was probably playing Nintendo, so this amazing set speaks to me on more than one level.&nbsp; This set consists of an almost-scale NES, a half-scale 13&quot; Color TV (the actual set here has about a 7&quot; diagonal), and a controller that&#39;s a virtually perfect 1:1 of the real thing.</p>

<h2>Hooking It All Up</h2>

<p>The build was plenty of fun, and the few repeating sections were simple enough that they never became tedious.&nbsp; I got a kick out of the bag that consisted of 60 identical pieces, all assembled in a single step--that was a new one.&nbsp; It was a bit of work making sure all the 1x1 tiles were aligned perfectly while building the game screen, but it was a labor of love and I couldn&#39;t get the original Super Mario Brothers theme out of my head the entire time.</p>

<h2>Putting in the Cartridge</h2>

<p>The NES console is a spot on replica of the original Nintendo console with the various connectors, buttons, labelling, and vents--even the pockets in the casing where the screws fasten it all together.&nbsp; Power, channel select (but come on, we all used channel 3, right?), and RF out are all right next to each other on the back, and for those of you with a proper monitor (not just a TV), RCA jacks for composite video and audio on the right provided slightly improved video quality.&nbsp; The cartridge locks into place and the seams between the tiles on it are used to advantage to form the detailed texturing you&#39;d find on a real cart.&nbsp; While the instructions don&#39;t explicitly state it, if you&#39;re not blowing in this thing before you insert it, you&#39;re using it wrong.</p>

<p>Hidden along the side of the NES is an Easter egg of sorts, a removable panel that reveals a micro-scale vignette from near the end of world 1-2, complete with warp zone.&nbsp; This was a nice touch and while I would have preferred a look at the various capacitors and other discrete components inside, I might be in the minority there.</p>

<h2>Powering on the TV</h2>

<p>While the console excels at realism and scale, the TV shines in function and personality.&nbsp; It&#39;s an eclectic mix of design cues inspired from across several decades.&nbsp; The tacky, faux-wood panelling around the sides feels very 70&#39;s while the silver-on-black lettering still looks very slick and reminiscent of Sony at the top of their game.&nbsp; In fact, while I couldn&#39;t find a single, clear inspiration for the model, the Sony Trinitron KV-1220U comes fairly close in many ways.&nbsp; The end result is a generally 70&#39;s-looking TV with some 80&#39;s design sensibilities, sitting atop very 60&#39;s wooden legs.</p>

<p>The TV has a Channel dial (which has a satisfying click to it), a pair of switches for VHF/UHF and Power, and three knobs for Volume, Brightness, and Contrast.&nbsp; On the rear of the set is a box where the power cord would come out of, a VHF antenna, and RCA inputs for composite video and audio.&nbsp; Those inputs are a pretty high-end feature for a set of this vintage--most of us connected our consoles via an RF converter.&nbsp; Finally, where I might expect to find a standard F-type connector for cable TV/antenna, there&#39;s something a bit bigger, likely the PAL (Europe/Japan) equivalent.&nbsp; I suppose I&#39;ll need to purchase an adapter...</p>

<h2>Good Thing We Get Extra Lives</h2>

<p>I&#39;ve yet to come across a set that I could call truly flawless (the Saturn V comes very, very close) but for the most part the flaws in this set are very few.&nbsp; My biggest issue with this set is the buttons on the controller.&nbsp; The A and B buttons are quite oversized and Start and Select are the wrong shape (they tried, but the parts don&#39;t really exist).&nbsp; I can&#39;t help but wonder if it would have been possible to create Start and Select as simple 1x2 tiles turned on their sides.&nbsp; And for A and B, even using a smaller red sticker on a grey 2x2 might have been an improvement.&nbsp; They&#39;re not awful, but the controller is probably the most iconic piece of the entire set, and everyone is going to pick it up and place their thumbs over the D-pad and buttons.&nbsp; It&#39;s likely to be many people&#39;s first impression and it would have been nice if it were closer to the real thing.&nbsp; That said, the many printed parts on the controller look fantastic and there are some pretty fancy building techniques to make it all work.</p>

<p>Aside from the controller buttons, my other gripes are very minor (and even the controller buttons are not bad, they just aren&#39;t great).&nbsp; The TV has no power cable and while I get why that is (where would you plug it in?&nbsp; And what about the other cables?), it is a bit odd having a hole in the back with no cord.&nbsp; There are also some dark grey bricks with holes (which serve a function on the interior) that distract a bit from the otherwise perfect black form on the back of the TV.&nbsp; If I were feeling generous, I might say they were holes where you could perhaps adjust the vertical hold and tint, but they&#39;re too distracting and I&#39;m forced to conclude Lego simply didn&#39;t want to make that part in black.&nbsp; I don&#39;t usually gripe about stickers but there are a few if that bothers you.&nbsp; Aside from the label on the rear of the TV and the SMB cart, all the other parts are printed--and there are a lot and they look fantastic.</p>

<h2>Here We Go!</h2>

<p>Turning to the functionality, the mechanism for screen scroll isn&#39;t revolutionary or anything, but is very well executed.&nbsp; It runs smoothly though the ratchet mechanism to keep it from scrolling backwards would almost certainly break a piece if someone were to force a reverse turn of the crank.&nbsp; This wouldn&#39;t be difficult for a child to do, so I&#39;ve been warning anyone who turns the crank to turn it gently and not backward.&nbsp; The map Mario plays through does not reflect any particular level from the game that I can tell, though it certainly suggests world 1-1.&nbsp; I do not have the Mario play-set kit to test with, but the implementation is very clever.&nbsp; Presumably there&#39;s a camera in his feet which reads the tag on the unit, telling him what model this is (triggering the music), and then the various sound effects are triggered as the different colors (yellow for coin, for instance) pass underneath him.</p>

<h2>Thank you Mario!</h2>

<p>So what&#39;s the verdict?&nbsp; Well, I&#39;m probably too much of a spaceship fan to say this set cracks my top 5, but it -is- my wife&#39;s favorite and it&#39;s a brilliantly designed set.&nbsp; The realism on the NES is amazing and the TV is charming and a perfect match for it.&nbsp; The nostalgia is absolutely real here and I&#39;m loving that we&#39;re finally getting more than just video games out of the long collaboration between Nintendo and Lego.&nbsp; As for me, I can already see myself making several mods: converting it to a scrolling shooter like Gradius, removing the vignette and adding some capacitors and a circuit board under that panel, and I&#39;ll probably take a shot at reworking that controller.&nbsp; And of course it needs R.O.B. and a Zapper to go with it.&nbsp; I wonder if I should go with orange or grey?...</p>

"connor_g","2022-08-29T16:14:08.977Z","Such a clever and fun build!","<p>Such a great build! I absolutely loved adding pieces on and wondering &ldquo;What on earth is this for?&rdquo; and then seeing it come together into an incredible cosmetic detail or really clever functional mechanism. Building the cartridge pop up mechanism in particular was such a ??&nbsp;moment as it came together.<br />
<br />
Only downsides to this set were 1. all the tiny 1x1 plates and trying to put them on perfectly straight, and 2. some of the mechanisms don&#39;t operate very smoothly, including the cartridge mechanism and the rolling screen. There are some videos you can find on YouTube with ways to improve this mechanism, but it&#39;s still a little sticky by virtue of bricks rubbing against other bricks.<br />
<br />
But overall, the attention to detail and the clever building techniques made this a ton of fun.</p>

"alfred_the_buttler","2020-08-18T06:47:04.417Z","Now Your Building With Power!","<p>Let&#39;s just say that I&#39;ve never been more excited about a set than this one. There are only a few toys that I still own from my childhood, and of those toys there are only two types that were so important to me that I actually kept all of the boxes and packaging (for the most part). If you haven&#39;t guessed already those would be Nintendo and Lego.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<strong>The Box</strong></p>

<p>I typically never review the box, yeah I keep them, but they aren&#39;t usually all that exciting, but this box is the exception. Probably the best design I&#39;ve ever seen on a Lego box, and not because it is beautiful, which it isn&#39;t, but because it looks just like the box that my NES came in. Lego did an incredible job recreating the look and feel of the box I received for my 8th birthday! And while I haven&#39;t bothered to dig up my NES box out of the crawl space, I imagine this box is roughly the same size &nbsp;</p>

<p>So when you open this wonderful and&nbsp;massive box on the left side, you end up pulling out bags 8-21 (including two bags for 10, 16, and 20), the flexible pneumatic tube for the controller, and then a plain white box (making this my first set with a box within a box). Inside the white box is unsurprisingly bags 1-7 (including three bags for 7), the rigid pneumatic tube for the antenna, a dark gray 16x16 plate, and the two instruction books and stickers in their own bag. As you would probably imagine, given the set has two main builds with their own instructions for each, this division of bags should line up with the builds, and they do, kind of. Bags 1-7 assemble the NES console with the second half of bag 7 being used to assemble the Mario cartridge. However, bag 8 is where you assemble the controller, which is technically part of the console build.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Now I&#39;m not an expert on parts, but this set has some rather unique parts that I&#39;ve never seen before. There are a lot of 6x6 tiles, which strangely have a matte finish unlike the usual shiny tiles. Then there are these really cool T-shaped bricks that are designed for SNOT building. You get two spring loaded struts, the only other sets I&#39;ve seen these on are the Clone Turbo Tank, although I assume technic builders are probably more familiar with them. Some interesting gears are included for rotating the screen, and it is built on 60 large treads that I have never seen before. The other big draw are all the printed parts, especially the ones with Nintendo printed on them, I&#39;d love to get a few more of those! There are 3 stickers in the set, but I&#39;m not upset about that because they are actually more accurate that way. 2 of the stickers are the label on the cartridge which always was a sticker. The other is for the back of the tv which would also have been a sticker most likely. But the great thing is that you are getting lots of very large bricks. While the price tag on this set is quite high, the price per brick is actually very cheap, and when you consider how many large (and printed) bricks you are getting, it is really a bargain.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>&nbsp;The&nbsp;Instructions&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>So you get to perfectly bound books, one for the console and one for the tv. I was a little surprised at how these instructions get right to business. The console book only has two pages at the front which contain a paragraph each about the NES and the designers. Then it&#39;s building time, with the end of the book containing a single page about the brick remover (which comes in orange just like the zapper did on later consoles, mine was still gray).&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The second book, for the TV, is much the same. 2 pages at the front discussing the history of Nintendo, and then down to business. At the end you get the parts inventory and that is it.</p>

<p>I do wish that for a set of this size they had more than just 4 spreads about the set, but I did appreciate the fact that it included pictures of other games, most notably Zelda and Metroid. Could this be a hint that they may make expansion packs with cartridges and screens for these games?</p>

<p><b>Minifgures</b></p>

<p>So this is the one thing that the set is missing. It would have been cool to have a Mario and Luigi minifigure to decorate this set with. But you do get the flat 8-bit Mario, so I will consider that to be a minifigure. It is a very interesting brick and is a perfect representation of an 8-bit Super Mario. You also get some printed tiles resembling Little Goombas, Koopa Troopas, mushrooms, stars, coins, and question mark bricks, plus a pipe made of two larger tiles. No, they aren&#39;t minifigures, but they are cool nonetheless!</p>

<p><b>&nbsp;The Build&nbsp;</b></p>

<p><b>Console&nbsp;</b></p>

<p>So you start off building the console which is basically just a gray box, sounds exciting, right? Well it actually is quite exciting. I never thought I could have so much fun and use so many different techniques in building a box. Best of all it isn&#39;t the least bit repetitive. Bag 1 builds the base, which looks like a nothing.</p>

<p>Bag 2 is the most interesting as it is where you build the spring loaded mechanism that allows you to push the cartridge down. Now if you want to be technical about it, the game should go straight in and then straight down, instead this game goes in on a slight angle and then rotated on a hinge to lie flat at the bottom of the console. Quite honestly it&#39;s good enough for me and is designed brilliantly with an axel that slides down along another axel and gets stopped by a cheese wedge when it hits the bottom. At that point you release it and slides a bit further down until it hits a roof shaped tile above it. Now it is in front of the cheese wedge, so when you push it down again, it slides all the way down at which point it moves past the locking mechanism and the entire mechanism is pushed up by the spring loaded struts. It works perfectly, and amazingly it doesn&#39;t even need to be sitting flat to operate it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After that, bags 3-7 complete the console. The technique use to create the grills is rather creative, and while I&#39;ve seen similar techniques, I&#39;ve never seen anything like it on this large of a scale. Of course the interior of the box is filled with all sorts of wacky colors and I sort of imagined that&#39;s how a real NES looks on the inside with all sorts of primitive circuitry. Eventually all of this gets covered up to give you that nice clean design you see in the pictures.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the most fun parts of the build is where you create the vignette of the end of level 1-2 with the warp zone. While this ultimately gets covered, this portion of the cover is removable so that it can be viewed. Also&nbsp;removable is the top so that you can see how the mechanics work.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another cool part is the lid. The patches on either side are thick and built up both on the console portion and the lid, but this was obviously done to give it stability. I own a Lego police set from the NES era that more accurately recreates the thinness of the lid, but is also incredibly fragile. This design is incredibly durable and will not break. The most interesting part of it however is the complex design that goes into creating the lip so that it sticks out minimally but still gives you a way to lift it. As you build this portion it seems so overly complex and unnecessary, but when it all comes together it is absolutely beautiful. The attention to detail that the designers had was amazing.</p>

<p>Finally, at the end of bag 7 you build the cartridge which is incredibly simple. All it is is stacking.&nbsp;While I would have loved to see some better detailing, certainly what they did was acceptable. My only real complaint is that the board that makes contact with the console, besides being missing, is green! Why didn&#39;t they make this white?</p>

<p>Bag 8 builds the controller which I must say isn&#39;t too familiar too me since I covered mine with stickers that I got from Nintendo Power, but looking at my NES Classic, it of course is incredibly accurate. I will say for such a small object that seems like it would be so straight forward, it is a rather complex build. The only inaccuaracy is where it connects to the console as it does not include the cut corner, although I can forgive Lego for that, it would be impossible to create that shape in Legos as such a small scale. However, it does connect to the console with a smooth and strong connection, yet is easy to remove and the cord will never come loose. I was very impressed with this.&nbsp;But be warned, the cord is short, so don&#39;t let your mom see you playing on this console or she&#39;ll tell you that you&#39;re sitting too close to the tv and it&#39;s bad for your eyes!</p>

<p>To build the console, cartridge, and controller took me about 3 hours, although I was taking my time and enjoying the build, I imagine I could have built it faster had I wanted to.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>TV</b></p>

<p>The TV starts out very similar to the console the first bag (9) builds the base, and the second bag (10) builds most of the mechanics that allow the screen to scroll. I was actually fairly surprised by the simplicity of the gears, I was expecting more, but it is a great design. The most interesting part is the device that prevents you from scrolling backwards, it&#39;s just a pin that catches a gear if you try to rotate it the wrong way.</p>

<p>Just like the console, the TV is a lot more than just a box and it uses a variety of different techniques throughout the build. As a result it makes the entire build very enjoyable. The back of the TV is completed during this time and is removable to reveal the mechanics.</p>

<p>Bag 14 is where you begin to build the screen and the bag contains a single type of brick, the 60 treads that the screen will be attached to. Bags 15 and 16 then build the panels that make up the screen and this is the only part of the build that is really repetitive.</p>

<p>After that 17 and&nbsp;18&nbsp;are the mosaic that creates the Mario level, which is 2 dimensional, an important detail as this is what allows Mario to &quot;jump&quot;. I suppose this is sort of a preview of what the new Lego Art line is like, and I completely understand why that line opted for round dots as opposed to square, getting everything straight is quite the chore and I sort of gave up on the minor details. Little imperfections actually look fine as you will be scrolling thru it anyways. The instructions have you build 3 panels at a time and do so by darkening panels completed in previous steps and providing you with a 2-D view. It does however offer 3-D views at the end of each bag when you are adding on the second layer of bricks.&nbsp;It took about 45 minutes to build this mosaic.</p>

<p>Finally you add the little Mario and then construct the front and top of the TV, both of which are removable to reveal the mechanics. The&nbsp;final build being the TV stand which is built upside down. As a result the TV can be removed from the stand very easily and you will need to hold the model from underneath if you wish to keep them together.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The TV build took me about 3 hours and 20 minutes to complete. Despite being much more substantial in size, you are able to fly thru assembling the screen as you are building the same thing 15 times. This is indeed the only repetitive part of the build.</p>

<p><b>Playability</b></p>

<p>Obviously this is a display piece that is intended for adults, it is 18+ after all. However this does offer all the playability you could ever ask for. The fact that the you can open the console, insert the cartridge, and push it down realistically is absolutely incredible. However, I&#39;ve been blowing in the damn thing and I can&#39;t get the power light to turn on for the life of me. How is that for realistic?</p>

<p>&nbsp;The scrolling screen on the TV is also an amazing play feature and I would say is almost flawless. I did have Mario fall down twice over the bricks he should have been climbing, but not a big deal, for the most part it works to great effect! The channel knob also can be turned and clicks, which does remind me a lot of how these knobs worked back in the day.</p>

<p><b>Overall</b></p>

<p>The attention to detail in this set is amazing. The NES is perfect. It perfectly mirrors every last indent and angle in the console, and does a tremendous job with all of the outputs.</p>

<p>&nbsp;The TV, while great does have a few flaws. First of all, it has an antenna, but it is a single antenna. Come on Lego, this isn&#39;t a handheld TV, it ought to have rabbit ears! Plus as you may recall, rabbit ears picked up VHF (2-13) and you would have had a round antenna for UHF (14 and up). Furthermore, while you have 3 knobs for adjusting the picture (I never even had one), you have a single knob for the channel. Typically UHF and VHF has separate knobs.</p>

<p>The other minor omission is you have the cable for the controller but that is it. There is no AC adapter or RF Modulator. You could add RCA cables to that list, but of course those were missing during the 80&#39;s as well, Nintendo was a little ahead of their time there. Of course when those became popular the SNES didn&#39;t offer&nbsp;them, go figure! I would have liked at least the RF Modulator so you could connect the console to the TV.</p>

<p>But that is it, no more complaints, and quite honestly, those aren&#39;t a very big deal. Overall this is one of the best Lego sets out there. It is also my largest set by far. My other 2000+ sets are Tower of Orthanc, Tantive IV, and the Ferris Wheel. This set differs greatly from those sets in the fact that they are all massive along at least one axis, whereas this set is not. Here you get two separate objects, both of which are modestly sized. It&#39;s kind of like you bought a 1200 brick set and a 1600 brick set.&nbsp;The console is indeed smaller than the original but it is not noticeably smaller, the same is true of the controller. However the cartridge is noticeably smaller, probably due to the fact that the console has a thick hinge it needs to fit thru,&nbsp;so it is therefore disproportionately smaller. The TV of course is tall, but is smaller than the console in its other dimensions. Quite honestly, I wouldn&#39;t expect it to be any larger than it is, although it probably isn&#39;t deep enough to house a CRT, not a big deal, the set was expensive enough, no need for it to cost more to make the back of the TV deeper.</p>

<p>For&nbsp;anyone who was a child of the 80&#39;s, this is a set that you need to have. I can&#39;t tell you how cool it was to hold this NES, It&nbsp;just feels so real.&nbsp;&nbsp;In some ways I prefer it to the NES Classic as it offers all the physical features of the original console, and my OLED TV just doesn&#39;t do 8-but graphics the justice that they deserve. While this can&#39;t play games, there is no reason why you couldn&#39;t take it out and put it in front of your NES Classic, blow in it a few times, and then turn on the new system, it certainly is much more satisfying than just hitting the power button!</p>

<p>I highly, highly, highly recommend this set. I&#39;ve never had a more enjoyable and varied build, it&#39;s a tremendous value if you go by price per brick and then consider how many of the bricks are very large or unique. The play features are excellent (and I don&#39;t have the Mario starter set yet). But really, this set will bring you back to your childhood, and really that is what it&#39;s all about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;I really hope that this isn&#39;t the end of the line for sets like this. I would love to get more games (Zelda, Metroid...) as well as a NES Advantage, Zapper,&nbsp;and U-Force. A Power Glove would also be cool even though I never owned one. Just imagine how cool it would be to get those gold Lego bricks for the Zelda cartridge! Let&#39;s keep our fingers crossed that this set will be expanded upon in the future.&nbsp;</p>
