"Novelty","2007-03-30T11:37:29.63Z","Variety is the spice of Lego","This is one of the better minifig packs out there - 2 forestmen, 2 black falcons, a gold lion, but best of all a peasant.  Yes, peasant, complete with pitchfork!  This isn't the only set with a peasant, but it is one of the smallest (6010 is the other small set with a peasant).  You can use the soldiers and archers to battle it out, but that gets stale after a while.  What can you do with peasants?

1. Behead them with the guillotine
2. Hang them from the castle gates

"sijpe","2008-07-19T14:28:27.31Z","A well balanced addition to the castle theme","Compared to the other castle minifigure-sets, this one offers the most diverse selection of faction-alignments and accessories.
Back then in 1988, green coloured lego was quite a rarity, as were the basket and pitchfork. It was tempting enough to make me act on impulse and spend some pocketmoney on this set. How I could make it fit in with my town collection was of later concern.

The one thing in this set that troubles me, is the brown (wooden?!) halberd. The oldgray version of this weapon feels historically much more accurate.

(Why this weapon is persistently called a battle-axe within the lego community, is completely beyond me, by the way.
A battle-axe is a much smaller, offensive weapon used in hand-to-hand combat against other soldiers on foot. An halberdier uses his weapon primarily as a defence against charging soldiers/knights on horseback. Thrusting the attacker out of the saddle first, then using the heavy blade to take him out permanently if the attacker felt the ill-adviced urge to try and scramble back to his feet.)",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

Castle was my favorite as a kid and these guys were a great addition to my realm. The villager was the lone one in my entire realm, so he was constantly being harassed by robbers, soldiers, knights, ghosts, and dragons--although he did romance the princess once, so it wasn't all bad!<br>",TRUE,4,4,1,5,5
"AETerry","2010-11-13T10:45:07.663Z","Castle Minifigures","<p>I picked this up at a time when I was trying to get all the Lego sets out there... and to be honest, I'd still pick up this set. Though now days Lego will call such sets a Battle Pack or include other accessories in a package so there's a bit more a build that can be done.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set offers a wide variety of minifigures for different Castle themes of it's time... including a rare or highly uncommon Peasant figure, Lion Knight, 2 Black Falcons and 2 Forest Men whom I was really into and collecting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And being able to pick up and get Minifigure Collections/Battle Packs like this really allows for diversifying a theme, expanding or creating MOCs.</p>",TRUE,5,5,2,5,5
"Odeinoichus","2010-12-18T22:58:10.593Z","Medieval Populace Explosion","<p>Set #6103 Castle Mini-Figures: Though I am uncertain how many of the actual Mini-Figures I have still actually originated from this set, I have to assume that I still have all the figures even if I don't have all of the accessories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This was a nice little Mini-Figure collection/battle pack style set from the '80s. It included two Black Falcons, a Crusader Lion, two Forestmen and a Peasant. I'm not sure how exactly I wound up with two of them, but I am absolutely positive that I must have had two, since I still have two Peasants and Four Forestmen. The accessories included with this set were utterly brilliant, unfortunately I no longer have the unique backpack piece that came with the Peasant and one of the pitchforks is gone. Also, one of the Black Falcons from the sets lost his shield at some point because instead of the blue boarder shield he's using the yellow boarder shield that came with the small knight's boat set. Which I plan on reviewing at some point even though I no longer own the set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that these style of sets were excellent and it's a real shame that LEGO only offers Battle Packs through their exclusive online store these days (with exception to the Battle Packs of Star Wars.), because I think these types of sets would still sell quite well in this modern age. If you can get one of these sets I highly recommend it, in fact I might just have to pick up a third one some day to have another of those nifty pitchforks and the Peasant's backpack piece. Does LEGO still offer the little feather pieces through their pick-a-brick function I wonder though? All but one of my Forestmen are stuck using the larger feathers from the spool because I obviously lost the smaller ones at some point.</p>",TRUE,5,4,2,5,5
"iamcjb","2011-01-09T18:07:37.88Z","Best ""Battle Pack"" Set","<p>I got this set as a Christmas stocking filler when my my older cousins collected Lego Castle so I could join in the fight. I still believe it's the best mini-fig set released.</p>
<h4>Box/Instructions</h4><p>Not much to stay. The figures obviously fit in the box for storage.</p>
<h4>Parts</h4><p>A great range of parts for a minifig set. Two different black helmets, a grey helmet, three different shields, two bows w/ quivers, a two handed axe, a couple of swords, and the great backpack and pitchfork.</p>
<h4>Minifigures</h4><p>Another brilliant selection. The two Falcons are the same except for the helmets, but the forest men have different torsos and hats. There's a Crusader knight with a grey helmet and the rare villager in blue with the black hood.</p>
<h4>The build</h4><p>As it's just mini figs the build is minimal.</p>
<h4>The completed model</h4><p>Six great mini figs to add to your collection. They have been kept in view, usually on a shelf, since I owned them. The villager is a great piece for the collection and&nbsp;truly&nbsp;irreplaceable&nbsp;to me. The three shields are also useful as I like variance in my armies as it adds realism to appearance. I find you can create some unique characters my mixing and matching the soldiers also (an idea I'm&nbsp;convinced&nbsp;Lego stole from me for Dark Forest).</p>
<h4>Summary</h4><p>As the title says I think this is the best ""Battle Pack"" style set available due to the variance in factions, something which most Battle Packs do not offer, instead offering only one faction. Unfortunately this pack is rare to come by, and is usually expensive to buy due to the demand for the set.</p>",TRUE,4,4,1,5,5

"Ernst","2012-10-20T09:20:11.803Z","Castle Mini Figures, a great variety of minifigures","<p>Overall 5 bricks: This set has a great content and is a great addition for the Castle collector. All the factions of sets in the 1980's are present and the set had a good price for those days.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Building 1 brick: No building experience, just the assembling of 6 minifigures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parts&nbsp;5 bricks: 2 Black Falcons, one swordfighter and one archer which also goes for the 2 Forestmen. One Crusader with an axe and a great Peasant figure with pitchfork. An extra remark for the great Forestman shield ! All well armed with shields so very good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Playabilty 5 bricks: Three different factions and one civilian in this set gives a high playability and even more when you add them to other sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Value 5 bricks: you can estimate the value from different angles. Bought new in the eighties for some €5,00 5 bricks. Buy them new now for prices starting at some €85,00 is in my view too much and used some €35,00 which is a normal price. I paid in a package deal €5,00 so for me 5 bricks here.</p>",TRUE,5,5,1,5,5

<p>There are some stand-out parts here, especially for those of us who were just starting our &quot;Castle&quot; set collection.&nbsp; I remember being particularly enthralled with the &quot;peasant&#39;s&quot; pitch fork, sack, and hood, not to mention &quot;Robin&#39;s&quot; quiver and hat!</p>

<p>While perhaps containing nothing that might be considered particularly groundbreaking, this set certainly sparked my imagination when I was a kid.&nbsp; In a way, I feel as though this set has what so many of the &quot;official&quot; and &quot;branded&quot; sets of today lack- the ability to allow the user to creative their own narrative.&nbsp; Who were the good guys?&nbsp; The bad?&nbsp; Who was left stuck in the margins?&nbsp; I whiled away many a rainy afternoon in the Sherwood Forest, deciding all of that (and more) with just this set.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
