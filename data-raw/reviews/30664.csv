"scolioreset","2020-09-02T08:45:56.08Z","""Together, we can rule this galaxy as father and son!""","<p><em>Full disclosure: The review will not consider the exclusivity factor in the overall rating as it&#39;ll be judged based on the authenticity, value at MSRP, minifigures and packaging. The set has been purchased on release date on August 27th on LEGO&#39;s online store. I do understand people showing their disappointment, yet I do not agree with the concept of leaving a negative review without having the actual product in hand. I would however support the consumers to send a message to LEGO by contacting them with a bit of decency and explain to the brand why the company should&nbsp;avoid this kind of exclusivity and offer suggestions for future sets, lines of product or scenes to be celebrated in the future.</em></p>

<p><strong>75294: Bespin Duel</strong> was meant to commemorate <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, a motion picture released in 1980. At the time of the review and the release of this set, <em>Star Wars: Episode V</em> celebrates its 40th anniversary as one&nbsp;of the most celebrated science-fiction action-adventure films of all-time. It is often regarded as the best episode of the franchise. The original <em>Star Wars</em> (<em>A New Hope</em>) was a light-hearted film yet the sequel goes in a different direction where we see the Galactic Empire winning the battles against the established heroes following the destruction of the Death Star in <em>Episode IV.&nbsp;</em>The lightsaber duel brings a closure to a chase by the Galactic Empire against the Rebel Alliance for a New Republic&nbsp;as Luke Skywalker confronts Darth Vader at the Cloud City on Bespin.</p>

<p>In 2017, a set was produced to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the original Star Wars film: <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/CELEB2017-1/Detention-Block-Rescue"">CELEB2017: Detention Block Rescue</a>. Unlike the present set, the 2017&#39;s toy was purchasable only after a few selected people were picked up at a raffle by LEGO at Star Wars Celebration in Orlando. It was around $60 based on a video from <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f56kx6K_fUE"">MiniSuperHeroesToday</a>. In 2019, the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75227-1/Darth-Vader-Bust"">75227 Darth Vader Bust</a>&nbsp;was also made available for Star Wars Celebration and Target in the USA. Much like the Vader bust at the time, this new set also possesses the regular LEGO number.</p>

<p>The reason I&#39;m adding this information is to give some sort of context as to why this set based on the fateful battle between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader exists. This was the set meant to be sold at Star Wars Celebration in Anaheim on&nbsp;August 27th to 30th. With the situation surrounding the coronavirus/COVID-19 pandemic, most conventions and events across the planet have been cancelled and, as a result, this set became purchasable in some selected stores including LEGO online in North America. In USA, the set was available at Target (RedCard exclusive) while Toys &#39;R&#39; Us in Canada had the exclusivity. At the time of the review, the Toys &#39;R&#39; Us page for the set is unavailable, most likely due to the set being out of stock. I unfortunately have no information regarding Mexico. At the time of the review, the set is sold out and is unlikely to be restocked unless there&#39;s a new wave of production and the possibility of a worldwide release.</p>

<p>Do I wish the production could have been made so it could be sold across all continents? Absolutely! Those vignette-style sets can be exceptional at reproducing authentic scenes that shaped the <em>Star Wars</em> universe without adding too many play features. We&#39;ve seen LEGO offer &quot;duel&quot; sets such as the ones based on the Mustafar battle in <em>Revenge of the Sith</em>, the 2 vs 1 fight on Naboo in <em>The Phantom Menace</em> and, in 2002, small sets based on the Final Duel in <em>Return of the Jedi</em> or the Duel on Geonosis between Yoda and Count Dooku/Darth Tyranus from <em>Attack of the Clones</em>. However, this is the first duel to receive the vignette-style treatment and this is THE scene.</p>

<p>This is originally the third time this scene is reproduced in LEGO form as we&#39;ve seen the first rendition in&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10123-1/Cloud-City"">10123 Cloud City</a> in 2003. In 2018, the first Master Builders Series set included this section as part of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75222-1/Betrayal-at-Cloud-City"">75222 Betrayal at Cloud City</a>. This set represents the end of the sequence that changed&nbsp;popular culture. The culmination of fear, anger and suffering led an unprepared&nbsp;Luke Skywalker to learn the tragedy behind the machine that is&nbsp;Darth Vader, one of the rulers of the Galactic Empire. The result of the duel shaped the fate of these characters for the rest of the series and the way we approached our protagonists, knowing they can be hurt, may have to suffer while the antagonist has ulterior motives, perhaps not the most evil ones at heart.</p>

<h3>Box/Instructions</h3>

<p>A medium-sized black box features the set in a very similar style to the Master Builders series as well as premium sets like the UCS or the Helmet Bust line of sets. It features the Galactic Empire emblem with the name of the set. While it is a duel between two opposite forces, the reinforcement of the Galactic Empire makes sense as Darth Vader has the advantage during the entire fight on Bespin, toying with Luke until the Jedi Apprentice is pushed to the limits of his learning of the Force. With more images of the set on the back of the box including a picture of the actual scene as well as the measurements of the set, not much else is featured as it is a decorative piece. It doesn&#39;t showcase any form of play feature that you would otherwise get. On the side with an additional yet 100% replicated look at the turbine where Luke is holding on, we do see the plaque of the 40th anniversary of <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>. On top of the box, we obviously have an actual size picture of a minifigure, Darth Vader being the chosen one, pun intended. As you might imagine, it doesn&#39;t showcase the actual minifigures as individuals unlike the traditional playsets or the Master Builders Series sets on the front, top or underside of the box so Luke Skywalker is nowhere to be seen except where the set is being actually displayed.</p>

<p>Regarding the instructions, I&#39;ve to say I&#39;m a bit disappointed they were folded. Considering the &quot;prestige&quot; of this set, you would wish that they were sealed like most UCS or MBS&nbsp;sets. It does show the QR code on the cover for online instructions if you wish to build it using your tablet or phone instead of using the actual booklet. You do need the app for instructions if you&#39;ve never used the QR code before.</p>

<p>To my surprise, the pages are ALL black including the construction segment unlike most &quot;prestige&quot; sets. You do have a small message from the creative director at LEGO Star Wars&nbsp;Jens Kronvold Frederiksen. While it says the scene is reproduced for the first time as a LEGO model, it is not entirely true as both Cloud City sets included the bridge and both minifigures. It is indeed the first time this scene is buildable on its own. It also shows two different screen captures from the motion picture as well as the small message translated in French and Spanish with the title of the set being displayed in the same format as the one in English which is interesting and adds a bit of respect for the main spoken languages in North America. To my personal surprise, in the French translation, Vader&#39;s name is still the original name instead of Dark Vador yet the LEGO official page in French-Canadian does mention Dark Vador.</p>

<p>With three numbered bags and a small sticker sheet for the &quot;plaque&quot;, the construction is set and ready!</p>

<h3>Parts</h3>

<p>While I&#39;m not a collector when it comes to LEGO sets, some pieces were relatively unknown to me. Some&nbsp;features of Betrayal at Cloud City are similar so you may find pieces from the previous iteration. The most notable pieces are the pitchfork in grey (also&nbsp;available to the Betrayal set) and the sword pieces in silver metallic that are used as antennas. The transparent 2x2 bricks are a nice addition. The&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/containing-part-6310976"">inverted roof-tile corner</a> has been used in the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/70437-1/Mystery-Castle"">Mystery Castle</a>, yet we have to go back to 2002 where the original UCS <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10030-1/Imperial-Star-Destroyer"">Star Destroyer</a> included two of&nbsp;those pieces. Otherwise, there&#39;s nothing special. If you own the same pieces except for the fork, maybe you can redo the set with your own minifigures.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p><strong>Luke Skywalker</strong>&nbsp;has over 40 different renditions since 1999 including old Luke from the sequel trilogy yet the &quot;<a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw0103/luke-skywalker-(cloud-city-tan-shirt)"">Bespin Luke</a>&quot; has been done only twice in the history of LEGO. Oddly enough, they all are from the aforementioned Cloud City sets. The reviewed one&nbsp;is however <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw0971/luke-skywalker-(cloud-city-dark-tan-shirt)"">the same</a> as the Betrayal set which I personally do not own.&nbsp;With both Cloud City sets being retired and the current set being sold out, this version of Luke as a&nbsp;minifigure remains valuable. The details on the bruised face is fine, yet I feel like his blacked eye isn&#39;t quite visible or evident. I don&#39;t know if they did tone down the detail or there is a bit of misprinting on my minifigure, yet it still looks great. It is more visible with a proper light source. However, the clothing details are great from the front to the back. It is a nice minifigure on its own and great addition to modern versions of <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw0778/luke-skywalker-(tatooine-white-legs-stern-smile-face-print)"">Tatooine Luke</a>, <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw0991/luke-skywalker-(pilot-printed-legs-visor-up-down)"">Red-5/Rogue Leader Luke</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw0635/luke-skywalker-(jedi-master)"">Jedi Knight Luke</a> from the original trilogy. Thankfully, the printing on the torso and legs came out great and were not off-centered.</p>

<p><strong>Darth Vader</strong>&nbsp;has received another major update and this is possibly the reason why Star Wars fans will want this set or <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75291-1/Death-Star-Final-Duel"">75291 Death Star Final Duel</a> (a remake of <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75093-1/Death-Star-Final-Duel"">75093</a>). The previous <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw0636/darth-vader-(type-2-helmet)"">Vader</a> which started in 2015, except for his <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw0744/darth-vader-(white-head-rebels)"">Rebels</a> exclusive rendition, was based on the armor from Episode III which was a continuity error since the character had a different suit in almost every episode.&nbsp;The <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw0004/darth-vader-(light-gray-head)"">original</a> rendition of Vader in 1999 had the proper colors for the buttons on the torso for Episode V and Episode VI yet the <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw0209/darth-vader-(death-star-torso)"">2008 version</a> was correct in featuring the original armor from Episove IV with the original <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10188-1/Death-Star"">Death Star</a> set and the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75150-1/Vader-s-TIE-Advanced-vs-A-wing-Starfighter"">TIE Advanced vs. A-Wing</a> set even though the white button on his breast panel is on the right when it should canonically be on the left. In 2016, Vader received an update with the spongy cape much like some Superheroes from DC or Marvel.</p>

<p>This Vader does include the two-pieces helmet introduced in 2015. However, it is the first time in over 20 years of LEGO Star Wars that the Dark Lord of the Sith receives <a href=""https://brickset.com/minifigs/sw1106/darth-vader-(printed-arms-spongy-cape)-(75291)"">arm printing</a>! In the 75291 Death Star Final Duel, Vader does have the spongy cape and the arm printing yet this Vader in the Bespin Duel set retains the previous style of cape. The printing on his arms are exceptionally done as it gives a complete range for his upper torso with the spaulders even though it&#39;s not totally accurate as it is supposed to be all black at the end,&nbsp;yet the effort is valuable and should be commended. The other details that amaze me about the arm printing, and this is all-around on Vader, are the extra lines for the leather-like clothing which do match the armor pretty well. The size of lines for Vader&#39;s details are also a little thinner which add a little of realism or authenticity. They went as far as to give Vader some printing on the back which is almost unheard of since the Rebels&#39; Vader did get back printing on the torso piece. What makes the back printing on this new Vader even more special is that it does continue the upper torso&#39; shape across the top of the minifigure. The printing on both the legs and torso pieces also came out great yet the legs are slightly off-centered on my minifigure, but it&#39;s not astromech-droid level of bad.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only thing that would make this minifigure perfect by LEGO standards is one little detail and that may be&nbsp;the pickiest thing: the upper button on Vader&#39;s breast panel should be blue instead of green. The buildable figure nailed this aspect, so I don&#39;t know if they try to stick an Episode IV reference. For those interested, this updated version of Darth Vader will be featured in the new <em>LEGO Star Wars</em> video game: <em>The Skywalker Saga</em>. You can expect this Bespin Luke to also be included. Regardless, both minifigures are excellent and I&#39;m glad the printing came out great.</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>Starting from the&nbsp;base with plates and the transparent pieces, there&#39;s a natural progression as you go through the building process. There&#39;s very little when it comes to repetition and the asymmetrical aspect of the bridge thanks to the decoration including the cutoff cylinders and the simili-turbine. As most people did, placing the flexible tubes for the rails was the hardest part because we have to get it right for the maximum of authenticity. It sure isn&#39;t as bad as the Betrayal set since the tube is folded twice. The other thing that I found a little more complicated and almost ruined the construction was the pitchfork that I nearly folded by force due to a specific step where I&#39;ve had to pass the pitchfork through two different pieces. Maybe it&#39;s a &quot;new piece&quot; kind of issue, but I was afraid to break the piece. Thankfully, the rest of the set is exceptionally straightforward and easy to assemble. Placing the trans-orange studs with the grips required me to adjust the tubes a bit, yet it was entirely fine once everything was in place. The turbine at the end of the bridge was definitely the most interesting with some inverted pieces an easy application of Technic elements.</p>

<h3>The completed model</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s get this out of the way: this isn&#39;t a playable set although it is marketed as a building set (or a buildable toy). LEGO still remains a toy company yet people of all ages find value in different things from action figures to video games. There&#39;s a reason why some sets (and large-scaled action figures) may be marketed for adults. This is intended to be a display piece so should be evaluated as such based on what we get.</p>

<p>With the stand and nameplate, you can definitely see that it doesn&#39;t try to be more than that. The recreation of the bridge is excellent and reaches a level of authenticity not seen on the two previous iterations. The scaling of the turbine at the end makes sense with the scene and the minifigures in action. While a bit too high, the cutoff cylinders do show a bit of the evolution in the fight even though they happen to be cut before Luke walks the plank to the turbine, so he could escape Vader. What is also appreciated is the trans-orange studs adding an extra level of authenticity since the previous iterations used trans-yellow or trans-blue pieces for the lights on the rails. Both were obviously inaccurate, but they did add enough to their respective sets.</p>

<p>The use of the microphone pieces adds a subtle connection for the rails of the bridge without being fixed. The sense of levitations thanks to the clear bricks is preserved for the bridge and can bring back the perspective of the studio photos.</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>We cannot escape the fact that this set has gone up in value since it&#39;s now sold out and potentially not returning on the LEGO online store. The exclusivity to North America may have been disappointing, yet similar sets are also&nbsp;rare for different reasons across the globe. However, the review isn&#39;t based on a set obtained from a reseller: I purchased it when it became available online. For the original retail price of $49,99 CAD, this set is clearly expensive to the point of being overpriced, especially for its purpose, minifigures and amount of pieces. Only a few parts are rare and noteworthy and there&#39;s little to no play features. However, much like Darth Vader, there&#39;s a bit of a conflict in me.</p>

<p>My appreciation of the set isn&#39;t based on MSRP, pieces and build. I&#39;ve watched <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> on VHS back in 1999 which means that this set hits me with nostalgia of an era where I discovered Star Wars as I built my first LEGO Star Wars sets: the original <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7110-1/Landspeeder"">Landspeeder</a>&nbsp;and the original <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/7150-1/TIE-Fighter-Y-wing"">TIE Fighter &amp; Y-Wing</a>. This set is the culmination of my appreciation of cinema and my childhood including my initial fear of Darth Vader which then became an appreciation for the character. As Vader said to his former master: the circle is now complete. This speaks to me as much as the 75093 Death Star Final Duel since I appreciated the confrontations between Luke and Vader in the original trilogy. Still to this day, Darth Vader is one of my favorite characters in any form of entertainment, one that struggles with anger and compassion behind the most legendary mask in the history of cinema, giving him the most iconic sound effect ever produced. The shot of Vader&#39; silhouette in the&nbsp;carbon-freezing chamber will forever be remembered and this set, thanks to the packaging and instructions, displays Vader at his prime.</p>

<p>As a display piece, it does its work to represent what it&#39;s supposed to be: a small replica of an iconic scene. This will go down as one of the better vignette-style sets: most people find little to no value in miniature starfighters for dioramas. Minifigures are a selling point for LEGO Star Wars fans and there&#39;s no doubt that this set was anticipated. I do hope LEGO sees the potential in releasing vignette-style scenes of popular scenes or sequences with the related minifigures for the fans worldwide.</p>

<p>With the MSRP for the minifigures and the build itself, <strong>75294 Bespin Duel</strong> may stand as one of the better sets to commemorate a sequence or a film. It takes the most iconic moment of its franchises and it runs&nbsp;with it thanks to a medium-level build in terms of difficulty with a lot of quality on display. Again, the minifigures look wonderful as Bespin Luke is still difficult to obtain and Darth Vader&#39;s new printing will stand the test of time.</p>

<p>I&#39;m glad to own this set, I do sympathise with&nbsp;the fans who may not have that opportunity. I do hope this review has been informative for those who needed a bit of understanding over the anger of the exclusivity and limited stock.</p>

"Lego_Lord_Mayorca","2020-10-20T00:29:51.183Z","A Fun, But Focused, Model of One of Cinema's Most Iconic Moments","<p>In the pantheon of great films of the 20th century, there almost always will be a place for <em>Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back</em>. While that means this is a film that can be celebrated and enjoyed at any time, now, at its 40th anniversary, is a perfect moment to regale it with marketable tributes. So of course, LEGO must get in on the action! The result is a static display model that zooms in on one of the most intimate and dramatic moments in the film, one that shatters what came before and sets up everything else that is to come (for better and worse).</p>

<p>Coincidentally, the 40th anniversary of this darker, more serious film comes about as LEGO provides darker, more serious packaging for its &quot;adult&quot; collectors. The box is as small as some $20 sets, but is black and austere, the image of the Cloud City weather gantry almost garish by comparison. The &quot;18+&quot; label seems inconspicuous, but effectively teases the buyer that he or she is in the big leagues now with LEGO, chain-smoking packs of Kools whilst idly browsing a pornographic magazine prior to opening the box and opening the three numbered bags of pieces.</p>

<p>A couple of pages at the start of the instruction manual contain screenshots from the film and a quote from Jens Kronvold Frederiksen regarding the obvious choice of scene to represent in LEGO form for the 40th anniversary celebration. I whole-heartedly agree, and I excitedly get to work building the set from bag 1. This contains just the foundation and the supports for the walkway. Pretty simple stuff, what with laying out tiles (nice 2x4s, which I already have in abundance) and stacking bricks and slopes.</p>

<p>More fun happens in Bag 2, which begins with the construction of Darth Vader, a splendid variant with printed arms and that new-ish helmet and head part. He definitely puts my previous Vader minifigures to shame! Back ot the model itself, the walkway itself starts to take final form, and the gantry is added to the model. Some smaller, more interesting parts come into play, particularly clips for the railings and a pitchfork for the vane at the end of the gantry.</p>

<p>As far as construction itself goes, Bag 3 gives us some delicate pipe bending for the railings around the main dais, and there is a fair measure of rod insertion through multiple parts for the slashed antenna assembly. Nothing an 18+ person can&#39;t handle, I reckon. At least, this 32 year-old managed alright. And of course, I can&#39;t forget Luke Skywalker&#39;s minifigure which makes up for the inaccuracy of having two hands by having a second face that truly captures the physical and emotional wounds wrought upon the overeager Jedi Padawan by the Sith Lord.</p>

<p>After a short trial-by-sticker-placement, the set is complete. As you might imagine, it looks impressive as a display piece. You can pose Vader on the 2x4 plate with central stud to look out towards a fleeing Luke, but the effect is somewhat minimized by how tall the slashed antenna looks compared to Vader. Honestly, it looks like he is having to peek around it at Luke! Also, while I admire the attention to detail on the whole assembly, I pine a bit for the main walkway before the steps to be another four to eight studs longer in order to accommodate more fighting space for the two combatants. Of course, the simplicity of the design means I am always free to add more walkway in the future, but for $40, I can&#39;t see the harm in the design including a few more bricks for the fans&#39; sake.</p>

<p>Overall, I really enjoyed the set. It is a relatively quick build that indeed looks great and focuses on a scene I&#39;ve wanted in LEGO form on its own for a long time. It is a fitting tribute to the most pivotal moment in Star Wars, and for the most part, it earns its place of prestige and prominence in any LEGO Star Wars collector&#39;s collection.</p>
",TRUE,4,5,4,4,3
"alfred_the_buttler","2020-09-05T09:19:09.377Z","Better than Cloud City","<p>First I just want to say that this set should say spoiler alert on it, because if someone just woke up from a 40 year coma, they are gonna want to watch the movie before opening the instruction book.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a much larger, better detailed, and more accurate version of this scene than the build that is part of the Cloud City UCS set. I never purchased that set, but I did piece together this portion of the set as I really wanted to recreate this scene. When I saw this new set was coming out I was hesitant to purchase it since I already had a version of this scene. Upon seeing all the demand for the set, and considering it was limited edition and still available from Target, I decided I&#39;d be kicking myself later if I didn&#39;t get it. Well I sure am glad I did, it looks amazing and everything about it is great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Box</p>

<p>As an 18+ set it has an incredible looking box that is very heavy duty. Now normally I don&#39;t care too much about boxes, but I&#39;m starting to realize that the boxes for the 18+ line are worth caring about. What I love the most about the box is that it features stills from The Empire Strikes Back which you can reference to accurately place your minifigures without having to pause the movie. Now that said, the box is the only thing 18+ about this set aside from the fact it features no play features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Instructions&nbsp;</p>

<p>They&nbsp;start with a nice little one page intro about this scene before switching to the build. It&#39;s a small set you can&#39;t really ask for much more than a page, and besides, Lucas made 3 movies to explain that one famous quote from this scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;The Build&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is far and away the only disappointment with this set, I&#39;ve never seen such a simple Star Wars build in a set of this size. It is no more than just simple stacking and some very simple antennas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Model and Minifigures&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now this is why you get this set. Both minifigures look superb although I would have loved it if they included a second Luke with a missing hand. The model itself is incredibly accurate and has very few exposed studs. This must be a new aesthetic the 18+ line is going for as the NES is similarly studless. Quite honestly, although it makes it difficult to place minifigures on it, they do give you a few studs for where you really need the minifigures to go, and I think it looks great. It looks more like a model than a toy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In comparison to Betrayal at Cloud City, this set is much more substantial. Not only is it much larger, but the Cloud City one was like walking a plank, whereas this appears to be a substantial structure. Furthermore the base for Cloud City is hideous, it&#39;s simply there out of necessity, whereas this one looks very sleek, not to mention it too is much more substantial. Cloud City is completely lacking in any details, whereas this set hasn&#39;t missed a single one. Plus Cloud City has studs where this one doesn&#39;t. Everything about this set is 1000 times better. It really makes me wonder why they did such a poor job on the UCS set (although at that time it did seem very acceptable).&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p>My only real complaint is that the 40th anniversary brick uses a sticker. I think in what is certainly a very special set like this, a print would have really sealed the deal in making this a premium set.&nbsp;</p>

<p>if you can still find this set, I do highly recommend it.&nbsp;</p>
