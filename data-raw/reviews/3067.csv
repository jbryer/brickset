"Novelty","2008-02-23T02:52:16.717Z","The Deep","Despite all appearance, this is a minifig pack with an aquanaut and a aquashark.  Of course, the set is packed with a shark and an octopus for play and a number of the seaweed plants for the backdrop.

There is nothing special about either minifig, each is the usual minifig found in their respective larger sets.  The aquanaut is equipped with silver daggers while the aquashark has silver harpoons.  There's also a silver crystal for the 2 of them to fight over.

This set has some display and play potential, but there isn't any building involved.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0

"BobaFett2","2011-01-11T13:29:34.317Z","This set has ups and downs-but it evens out in the end","I got this set nearly complete from part of a friend's LEGO collection. I completed it myself with instructions from peeron.com.<br><h4>Instructions/Presentation</h4>So how is this set presented? It shows an Aquanaut and an Aquashark on a cool blue terrain piece. There's two bushes, a crystal just sitting there (I assume the Aquashark is swimming towards it), and two sea animals-an octopus and a shark, swimming around. The set is an accessories pack, but that didn't stop LEGO from making it look good.<br><h4>Design</h4>There's not much to say about design-this is a part pack. I like to think of it as the ""ancient"" version of a battle pack-a few Minifigures, 2 sea creatures, and a few common accessories from the theme. If the animal are counted as Minifigures, that's a pretty nice battle pack.<br><h4>Minifigures</h4>The set includes two Minifigures: an Aquashark and an Aquanaut. The aquanaut is standard, with a sweatband, armor, flippers, and thankfully trans light blue visor (less common than black). The Aquashark has a trans neon green hook hand-awesome. Sharks and Octopi are some of the coolest sea animals, and some of the most useful.<br><h4>Price</h4>For 6 dollars, I'm getting 22 parts. This includes Minifigures and animals. Not the best, I know, but things were different back then. I AM getting lots of knives and harpoons (I just LOVE those knives), plus some animals, bushes, and Minifigures. I'd say it's worth it for the diehard (or not so hard) Aquazone fan.<br><h4>Playability</h4>Well this is obviously not swooshable. It is, however, extremely useful for setting up a little vignette-all you need are a few rocks and maybe some transparent bricks (for a swimming effect), and it's good. Or you can improve the bases (the Aquasharks have no base, the Aquanauts have an awesome one) with an extra fig and bush. Plus you get more of those crystals that they were warring over.<br><h4>Overall</h4>Pros:<br><ul><li>Minifigures</li><li>Chrome Accessories</li><li>Animals</li><li>Bushes</li></ul>Cons:<br><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Not enough parts?</li></ul>Do I recommend this set? If you can get one for a decent price on bricklink, go ahead. It's great.<br>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,3
"Odeinoichus","2011-01-11T18:09:12.86Z","Aquazone Battle Pack","<p>Set #6104 Aquacessories: An appropriate name for this little set. Aquacessories is exactly what this set was all about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It includes two Mini-Figures, an Aquanaut and an Aquashark, it also includes a LEGO Octopus, a LEGO Shark, a few plants and an energy crystal. As well as the weapons that were first introduced with Aquazone. Chromed Silver Torpedoes and Daggers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as Mini-Figure collections are concerned this one wasn't as impressive as some of the others. After all it only included two Mini-Figures instead of four or six, but it did give you a chance to get some LEGO animals to pit against your Aquanauts or Aquasharks, and it did have some nifty looking plants. (I wish LEGO would re-introduce that red color for those pieces in the new under water themes.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd recommend this set to any Aquazone fans. It might not look like much, but it has a lot of useful additions for the other Aquazone sets. Plus you can never have enough energy crystals and this one has two.</p>",TRUE,4,4,2,4,4
