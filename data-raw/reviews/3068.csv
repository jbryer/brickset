I bought a few of these, simply for the wolfpack guy!  Overall, these minifig sets are magnificent, I really wish that Lego would put out a few more like this.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2007-04-29T09:16:13.84Z","Three of these minifigs...","This is the first castle minifig pack with a horse, however, it lacks a lance or a visor to make one of the minifigs a knight.  That's the only downfall.  This is also a great way to get the wolfpack minifig, including the wolfpack shield.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"legotrainfan","2007-10-30T12:53:50.28Z","Quite good","This is the first castle minifig set with a horse in it. The minifigs are great and, as usual, you get lots of weapons. But there is only one dragon shield. There could have been one or two more. A lance is also missing. One Wolfpack minifig is great, but two would have been greater. And there isn't a wizard with his magic wand. ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"MPH","2009-04-21T09:28:35.043Z","Mediocre minifig set","Minifigs are always welcome, but instead of the six that came with 6102 and 6103, this set has to do with only four. To compensate, there is a horse, but unfortunately it lacks the special Dragon Knight head piece. Or maybe there should have even been a dragon instead of the horse - these are the Dragon Knigths, right?

Also, Majisto is missing. Not that there aren't enough Majisto's in other sets, but he should have been included for some welcome variety. An extra wolfpack guy would have also been nice. And maybe another regular Dragon soldier instead of the yellow-plumed knight. Why so many knights and so little soldiers in the Dragon Knight sets? 

Probably the only really good thing about this set is the blue-plumed knight with cape - he is pretty rare as he only appeared in 6048 and this set. The other figs are OK, but I can't help to feel that this set is undercrowded and out of balance. And there should have been one more dragon shield!

"hustla187","2008-08-16T13:10:08.217Z","Why One Wolfpack Minifig?","I don't get that there are 3 Dragon Knights and one Wolfpack knight in this set. If this is an accessories set, there should be at least one more Wolfpack minifigure. This is pretty bad for an accessories set and doesn't impress the Castle fans.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"Gus_263","2008-04-09T09:08:11.827Z","More castle minifigures","This set, basically a minifigure pack, is one of the black knights theme, released in 1993. The minifigures included are four knights and a horse. The horse is like other horses, good designed and simple, don't moves the paws but still in a good shape, this have basically a black color and carries a spear. One of the minifigures is a &quot;knight&quot; (not exactly, this have no armors) of the wolfpack theme, simple designed but still nice, and have a brown color, with a symbol of a wolf and have a sword, a shield and a cap. Other knight looks like to be a knight of the dragon, have a helmet, some blue, black, red  and yellow printed details, featuring a printed dragon. The mnifigure is also simple and too includes an axe. Other two minifigures also looks like to be dragon knights, due to the details on the armor, and these are basically the same, but the faces and helmets have some differences, like the colors. These includes a crossbow, another sword and shield. Altough this set not includes a black knight, it was released in 1993 and still cool, another small set and with no building except for minifigures,  but this small set includes simpleand nicely designed minifigures, good to increase other castle sets, a good option to get some cool minifigures from old lego castle times.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Ernst","2013-03-07T13:01:23.573Z","Nice Armybuilder with something to desire.","<p><strong>Overall 4 bricks</strong>: Although this is the only Castle battle-pack with a horse no 5 bricks from me. The horse is a nice extra but better would have been an extra Wolfpack mini figure. This set is now after 20 years more a collectors item for a real Castle collector, not a great addition for the &quot;normal&quot; Lego fan.</p>

<p><strong>Building 1 brick</strong>: This kind of sets can be compared with the modernday CMF&#39;s. No building, only the assembling of mini-figures so 1 brick here.</p>

<p><strong>Parts 4 bricks</strong>: The present&nbsp;figures&nbsp;are very good with the horse as a bonus. Like said before, it would have been better with an extra Wolfpack figure. A good amount of weapons and the helmets with plumes of the Dragon Knights are superb. Another bonus is the cape for Dragon Knight leader. An extra Dragon Knight shield would have been welcome.</p>

<p><strong>Playability 5 bricks</strong>: A young Lego fan can play great adventures with this mini-figure set and added to other sets also great playability.</p>

<p><strong>Value 5 bricks</strong>: Both the new price in 1993 and the 2013 used price are worth 5 bricks. Buying the set now in mint condition will cost you over &euro; 50,00, maybe worth it but you are obliged to keep it sealed or you lose at least &euro; 35,00. If you buy it used be sure to get some proof (part of the original box)&nbsp;with it that ensures you you don&#39;t buy just some loose left over mini figures.</p>
