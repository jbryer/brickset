Turns out, this wasn&#39;t based on&nbsp;<em>Order of the Phoenix</em>&nbsp;after all, but the scene at the Three Broomsticks before Katie Bell is cursed in <em>Half-Blood Prince</em>, just like the Ron and Hermione figs from this series. The printed hoodie included in this CMF is very much superior to the one featured in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75967-1/Forbidden-Forest-Umbridge-s-Encounter"">75967</a> and <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75980-1/Attack-on-The-Burrow"">75980</a>, with more detail and an overall nicer look, while the pants are almost too much. This pair of jeans features, not only a printed belt, but also printed pockets and stitches down the sides of the legs! That is&nbsp;cool, although superfluous, but the whole thing is kind of ruined by the printed shoes on the feet. I&#39;m a big fan of printed shoes on characters wearing shorts or skirts, like Umbridge or Queenie Goldstein, but a character wearing long pants looks very weird to me with shoe printing. Harry&#39;s head features the same smile found on the figs in the sets, but has&nbsp;an exclusive worried expression on the reverse.</p>

<p>The highlight of this CMF is not the minifig, though, but the accessory! Harry comes with a sand blue book, with a printed cover, which has got to be the nicest book LEGO has put out since the excellent printed books from the first Harry Potter sets in 2001-2002. The cover looks exactly like the Advanced Potion Making book used in the <em>Half-Blood Prince</em> film&nbsp;(and it matches the brown, stickered version that appears in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75969-1/Hogwarts-Astronomy-Tower"">75969 Hogwarts Astronomy Tower</a>), and inside there is a printed tile featuring printed text and handwritten scribbles, among them the spell &quot;Sectumsempra&quot;. This is a good version of Harry (although I hope we get the cool, red jacket from the end of&nbsp;<em>The Half-Blood Prince&nbsp;</em>further down the line), but it&#39;s the Advanced Potion Making book that makes it (sort of) worth paying the incredibly high, new price for CMFs.</p>
