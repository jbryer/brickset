"J0rgen","2020-09-08T08:12:46.29Z","The finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen!","<p>I own every minifigure version of Dumbledore ever released, and until now, no version has ever surpassed the 2001-2002 version (or its fleshie update in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4757-1/Hogwarts-Castle"">4757</a>) in my eyes. The version found in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75954-1/Hogwarts-Great-Hall"">75954 Hogwarts Great Hall</a> is good, but doesn&#39;t entirely&nbsp;capture Dumbledore&#39;s character, and while the <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71022-16/Professor-Albus-Dumbledore"">previous CMF</a>&nbsp;and the version found in <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/75948-1/Hogwarts-Clock-Tower"">75948 Hogwarts Clock Tower</a>&nbsp;are very detailed and good, they&#39;re based on Michael Gambon&#39;s portrayal of Dumbledore, and to me there can be only one: Richard Harris.</p>

<p>This version of Dumbledore is based on Harris&#39; portrayal in the first two films, and sports the star-speckled, dark red and black hat he wears in these films, dual moulded onto white hair. This is actually the first Dumbledore figure to have white hair, and it makes a huge difference! Like the version of Dumbledore in Hogwarts Great Hall, he wears the beard originally made for Gandalf, but this time in white. The combination of the new hair/hat mould and the beard is perfect, and so is the face underneath. One side of the face features a little smile, and ever so slightly contracted eyebrows, giving off an air of polite inquisitiveness, very appropriate for Dumbledore, while the other side features an open-mouthed smile and raised eyebrows, radiating happy surprise. You can&#39;t see all of this beneath the beard, of course, but of all the bearded characters with alternate face prints I have owned, this&nbsp;has some&nbsp;of the most effective different faces. Dumbledore is dressed in a magnificent dark red robe that is printed both back and front, and this is actually the first time a Richard Harris based Dumbledore comes with a dress piece instead of normal minifig legs, which is a most welcome change.</p>

<p>The minifigure itself is spectacular enough, but he also comes with an accessory long missed by fans, a new moulded Fawkes&nbsp;the phoenix. I&#39;m very fond of my 2002 version of Fawkes&nbsp;from <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/4730-1/The-Chamber-of-Secrets"">4730 The Chamber of Secrets</a>, but in terms of accuracy and printing, this has got that beat. Fawkes has nice orange and black printing on a red body, looking&nbsp;exactly like he does&nbsp;sitting perched in Dumbledore&#39;s office, or crying his healing tears onto Harry&#39;s wound in the Chamber of Secrets. Unlike the 2002 version which could be imagined flying as well as perched, this version of Fawkes feels more inanimate, so I hope we might have a flying version at some point too, perhaps in a new set based on the Chamber of Secrets.</p>

<p>If you&#39;re only going to get one figure from the new series of collectable minifigures, it should definitively be this (or <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/71028-14/Moaning-Myrtle"">Moaning Myrtle</a>). You might have a heap of Dumbledores already, but none are as good as this, and the new Fawkes&nbsp;brightens up whichever version of Dumbledore&#39;s office you might have (especially next to the new sword of Gryffindor, if you <em>are</em> getting more than one CMF). It&#39;s hard to justify the new, elevated price for collectable minifigures, but if there is one that&#39;s woth it, it&#39;s this one.</p>

"Th3_3m3rald_M1n3cart","2020-10-12T16:08:15.127Z","The best Dumbledore minifigure of all time.","<p>At first, I didn&#39;t like Harry Potter series 2. Then I saw this Dumbledore minifigure and it instantly became one of my favorite series. Enough of my own opinion, let&#39;s look at Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore.</p>

<p>This minifigure is instantly recognizable and looks awesome. He has the semi-new skirt/dress/robe piece, with a lot of intricate and ornate printing. His torso print lines up perfectly with the legs and looks great. He has two face prints, which I don&#39;t think is really necessary for Dumbledore (since it doesn&#39;t make that big of a difference). His beard is one of the more generic beard pieces, which was first seen on Gandalf from&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. He has a new hair-hat combo, which features his pointed starry hat he wears in&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s stone </em>(or Philosophers stone depending on where you live). He does have some back printing which has his hood (which I wasn&#39;t aware he had). For his accessories he has his normal tan wand, which I think should be dark gray to be more accurate to the Elder Wand. His other accessory is a brand-new mold for Faux the Phoenix, which looks fantastic, and is way more accurate than the 2002 mold, or the 2018 brick-built version from the great hall.</p>

<p>Unfortunately CMF (Collectable MiniFigures) are now $5 in the U.S. However, I think this minfigure is well worth $5, as are most minifigures in this series. Overall, I think this is without a doubt the best Albus Dumbledore minifigure we&#39;ve ever got, and ever will get.</p>
