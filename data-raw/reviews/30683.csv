<p>The figure in general is not bad with dual&nbsp;moulded legs with side leg printing as well. The torso has a pattern on which is accurate to the&nbsp;scene from the half blood prince film.&nbsp;The face is not much different to the Hermiones in&nbsp;the sets&nbsp;but is exclusive and the hair is used in other sets from the 3rd&nbsp;film to the 6th one.</p>

<p>Her accessories&nbsp;is a new butter beer piece which was exclusive to her and the Ron figure until it was used in hogsmeade&nbsp;village and the dark tan wand.&nbsp;The stand is the normal stand from most CMFs.</p>

<p>However, this figure lacks points because there could be a more interesting variant like one from the deathly hallows.</p>

<p>Overall I would say this figure is a good figure but,&nbsp;not one of the best from the series so if you were to get one of the figures I would say try to find a more interesting one.</p>
