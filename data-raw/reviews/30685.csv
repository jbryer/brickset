<p>The lion hat that she is wearing is not that accurate to the film but it is close. It has two eyes and a nose. It has some ribbons gold and brown&nbsp;that are all around the lion hat.</p>

<h3>Hair</h3>

<p>She also comes with hair. It is a blonde ponytail that sort of looks like her hair from the film.</p>

<h3>Head</h3>

<p>Her head has two expressions. One is happy and the other one is slightly worried.</p>

<h3>Body</h3>

<p>Her body has a cool print that has some pink polka-dots and some teal lines. The back of her body has the same pattern.</p>

<h3>Legs</h3>

<p>Her legs are dual-moulded and the top half is pink and the bottom half is dark red. She has some pocket details and in-between the dark red and pink there blue, teal and black stripes.</p>

<h3>Accessory and stand&nbsp;</h3>

<p>She comes with a brown wand and an extra one. She has the regular black stand for CMF minifigs.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>I think this is one of the best minifigs from this series. The prints on this minifig are so detailed. I think you should get this minifig even if you are not a fan of Harry Potter (like me).</p>
