"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-31T22:14:19Z","Nice Set!","This is, despite its size, a realy cool set.  I like the fact that you can carry a crystal or two on the back.  If you spread the figs out enough, you can fit two of them on it.  This set is especially cool if you use it with a bigger stingray set such as 6198. If you need a small scout ship for your fleet, it is a must have.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-22T15:52:12.623Z","A great mini-set","Every series usually has three specific sets: a miniset, which is cheap, has plenty of accessories and enough playability; a &quot;flagship&quot; set, which is midsized, midpriced, and has everything to represent the series; and a larger &quot;kingset&quot;, with plenty of minifigures, accessories, playability, and ties the whole series together.

This is a miniset, it offers a minifigure from the series, some parts of the cholorscheme, accessories (crystal, fins, knives..., something to sybolize the series (in this case the front part with the stingray face), and plenty of playability. This can easily be rebuilt and reused over and over, this is what gets minisets a 5/5.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"Atbin7856","2009-04-29T22:20:42.84Z","Don't judge a set by its box cover.","A great mini set, but don't judge it by its size and here's my review:

Pros: 
Great mini figure.
Has two knives on the set which makes it look intimidating in a good way.
I got this for $2 so its cheap.
Mini figure looks like a ""squid man"" if you were to take off the helmet.

Cons:
No cons but mine is in pieces, (I have to build it again) but other than that, I love this set!

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The chief among them being that there really isn't much to do with this set when it's the only one you have. The model itself is a nice looking submersible craft, it fits in great with the Stingrays Theme, but personally I was a little more partial to the Aquasharks and their menacing looking craft. The Stingray Mini-Figures are great, their head designs were awe inspiring and their torsos looked impressive, plus that helmet... I really can't find fault with this set aside from the fact that it is a rather plain and ordinary style impulse purchase set.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gray flippers and chromed silver crystal are nice accessories too as always. However I can only recommend this set for fans of the Theme who are looking to get another Stingray Mini-Figure. Or who want some unique looking pieces, because quite frankly those pieces are much better suited for a good MOC than just building up the standard model from this set. Kinda wish I hadn't parted with my Aquazone stuff now that I think about it though.</p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,5
