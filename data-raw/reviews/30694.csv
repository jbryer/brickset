Myrtle has two different faces, both perfectly representing Myrtle&#39;s typical moods; one is upset and crying, while the other has a very&nbsp;angry frown. Her skin tone is not white, like Nearly Headless Nick in 75954 Hogwarts Great Hall, but a light blue that almost looks like it&#39;s glowing. Her&nbsp;hairpiece is a new mould, perfectly representing the character&#39;s hair onscreen. The hairpiece is dark blue, continuing the bluish hue of her skin, cemented by the sand blue, old-fashioned Hogwarts uniform she is wearing. Her accessories are a transparent stand to make her &quot;fly&quot;, like the ones from the DC CMF series, and an unharmed version of Tom Riddle&#39;s diary, matching the destroyed version included with the Dobby CMF back in 2018. The diary has a printed tile inside, featuring the first words of Harry&#39;s interaction with Tom Riddle&#39;s memory.</p>

<p>Moaning Myrtle has been among the most wanted Harry Potter characters for years, and this&nbsp;minifigure certainly delivers in every way:&nbsp;Great prints, a new mould, and the perfect accessory. The only drawback is the price, but with a fig this great, it&#39;s almost worth it.</p>
