The other name for the set was crab, but it seems to be more of a cockpit on legs. I just can't imagine this...this thing crusing under the seas around the fish. Fortunatly, it makes up the rating with a good selection of parts including the crystal, sea plant, graber arm, arm joints, and basic bricks. I suggest buying two if you can, and combining the parts into a super ship (so it looks more like a crab).
Good parts, Okay playing ability, and Weird model.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

This set has plenty of cool pars since it has the cockpit base, two arms, two propellors in the back, and the signature grabber arm used by the stingrays. Mine has the baseplate which, unlike the aquanauts promo baseplate, has no apparent purpose other than making the set look cooler (but at least it does).

The parts it has are well used and can easily be well reused if you want, plus the grabber tool is really cool. The fact that this set has the container too makes me think it was meant to be the flagship for the stingrays, but this is too small, and the next set up is too big. 

Note: Be careful, pay no more than $10 unless it has a baseplate or is MISB.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

A nice little set, which sits neat on any underwater diorama. Would suggest a price of 10 EUR if you buy this secondhanded. Sounds about right I think.<br>",TRUE,4,4,5,4,4
