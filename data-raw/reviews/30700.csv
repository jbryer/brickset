<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigure&nbsp;</h3>

<p>This set comes with one minifigure, Digi Lloyd. I like this figure, the new mask mould looks nice in green, the futuristic blue circle/sensor looking pad on the torso and legs is quite nice, and the spring green on his right arm is a nice new green for Lloyd that we&#39;ve never had on any of his Figures. Now, the problems with this figure is that he already comes in 4 prime empire sets, and while it can be good to have an extra of him, this variant doesn&#39;t even come with the shoulder armour, making the figure less valuable. My other problem with this figure is the head, the side that you see on the packaging is a very well-designed print, the alternate expression is very similar to last year&#39;s spinjitzu slam Lloyd from the summer 2019 wave, where the only difference is that the&nbsp;smirk on the face moves to the other side. Overall, the figure is just okay in my book, so I&#39;d rate it a 4/10.</p>

<h3>Accessories/Build</h3>

<p>In this set you get two accessories for Lloyd: his movie sword, and a new dual bladed weapon. The movie sword is an unnecessary inclusion, but I like that its here, since it hasn&#39;t come in too many sets recently, it&#39;s nice to get an extra. Now the dual blade weapon is... unique. Its kind of boring compared to the other builds that they usually do for the magazine packs. The inclusion of the game controller piece is very nice, since you don&#39;t get many spares in the sets.&nbsp;So I&#39;d rate the &ldquo;builds&rdquo; a 5/10.</p>

<h3>Packaging</h3>

<p>the packaging is just a basic foil pack, nothing really new there. I do like that it&#39;s just a tear to open, because it makes it easier to open it. the design on the front is nice, using what looks like a new render for Lloyd and that weapon, and then on the bottom left is a picture of the actual figure with both weapons. Overall, I&#39;d rate the packaging a 10/10.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>Overall, this set I okay, the Lloyd is disappointing, and the weapons are ok all together. I&#39;d rate this set a 5/10.</p>
