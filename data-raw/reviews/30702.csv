<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">This set is PHENOMENAL. There are so many amazing things to admire. It is one of the best designed Lego sets ever. The set comprises 4 sections, each placed on a 16x32 baseplate, which can be rearranged and configured in a variety of ways. By the way, I counted every piece in the set so I could figure out how many pieces are in each section, as I couldn&rsquo;t find the information anywhere online. You&rsquo;re welcome.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none""><span style=""text-decoration-skip-ink:none"">Section A- 1368 pcs</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The first section, comprising Ollivander&#39;s Wand Shop and Scribbulus Writing Implements, isn&#39;t as vibrant or colorful as the other parts, but that&#39;s not a bad thing. It creates a lot of contrast with the other buildings, and it&#39;s very faithful to the on-screen appearance.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Ollivander&#39;s is one of the best shops in the build. The circular display windows are shaped very nicely and the new wand box elements are great as well. The staircase that swings outward is very well implemented and makes sure that interior space isn&#39;t unnecessarily wasted.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Scribbulus is much smaller but I think that&#39;s appropriate as it is by far the most obscure of the included shops. The shelf that is built into the wall containing inkpots and quills is excellent and makes good use of the limited space. The display window extending into the street is also very well done. Unfortunately, the rest of the space is taken up by a very simple table build containing just a lamp and a piece of paper, and it doesn&#39;t do much to enhance the interior. It&#39;s a minor gripe, but they really could have done more. The apartment above is small but really nice.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none""><span style=""text-decoration-skip-ink:none"">Section B- 1092 pcs</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The second section, containing Quality Quidditch Supplies and The Daily Prophet, is by far the weakest of the four, though it&#39;s still quite good.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The display window for QQS is very cool, resting at an angle on a hinge. There are a lot of neat things in the interior, like the rack of beater bats, the Firebolt, and the new Quidditch uniforms, though I find it very disappointing no capes were included. This shop also feels very empty compared to the other ones. The ceilings are extremely high and there&#39;s nothing up there, so it feels like wasted space. This was probably done so that the dimensions of the building would match section D, so they can be placed back-to-back. I actually don&#39;t mind the high celings, but I think they could have been utilized better. Broomsticks and Quidditch balls hanging from the ceiling would have been really cool. Also, this section does not have a staircase, unlike the other 3. It really could have used one, as there is so much available space.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The Daily Prophet Headquarters is tiny. It&#39;s just a crate of Newspapers, a spiderweb, and a really cool sticker on a panel depicting many newspaper headlines from throughout the series. I don&#39;t really mind it being so small, but there&#39;s a lot of wasted space in the upper area. I really like the attic on the very top. It looks great, has some fun details, and has an access hatch to the roof, which is much appreciated. Overall, this section looks great from the outside, but the interior could have been improved upon.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none""><span style=""text-decoration-skip-ink:none"">Section C- 1287 pcs</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The third section, home to Florean Fortescue&#39;s Ice Cream Parlor and Flourish and Blotts, is my second favorite of the four.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Fortescue&#39;s by far the best of the small shops. The tiled flooring looks amazing. The limited space available is used very well, and the canopy outside uses a simple but ingenious build technique.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Flourish and Blotts is one of the shops that I had wanted to see in Lego form for ages so I&#39;m so glad they&#39;ve finally done it. The builds for the bookshelves and the piles of books are excellent and I love how it&#39;s themed around Gilderoy Lockhart&#39;s book signing event. There&#39;s not much room on the lower floor but the upper floor is surprisingly spacious. I&rsquo;m disappointed they didn&rsquo;t include spaces for actual books to fit onto the shelves as all of them are just decorative.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none""><span style=""text-decoration-skip-ink:none"">Section D- 1665 pcs</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The final section, Knockturn Alley and Weasley&#39;s Wizard Wheezes, is by far the best. It&#39;s not even close.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Knockturn Alley is a very small gateway but it&rsquo;s great for what it is. The crooked windows and sign give it a really sinister look and the way it just sits in between Flourish and Blotts and WWW is perfect. The decision to position it here is genius because it allows WWW to occupy a corner like it does in the movies. It&rsquo;s a bummer we didn&rsquo;t get Borgin &amp; Burke&rsquo;s, but I understand its exclusion as it wouldn&rsquo;t fit in with the main part of the street.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Weasley&rsquo;s Wizard Wheezes is incredible. It&rsquo;s got twice as many details as all the other shops and much more interior space because the building is 12 studs deep, while the others are only 8. There are so many fun references to different products like the Basic Blaze Box, Edible Dark Mark, and Skiving Snackboxes. It&rsquo;s so colorful and vibrant and the whole thing is very cohesive because all the staircases are fully inside the building. The hat lifting feature of the giant Weasley statue is also excellent. My only complaint would be that some of the areas in the back are very difficult to access.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none""><span style=""text-decoration-skip-ink:none"">Minifigures</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The overall quality of minifigures in this set isn&rsquo;t the best, which has been a trend of minifigures in large sets recently. None of them have specialized leg prints, which is very disappointing given how expensive this set is. But there are still some positives. All of the minifigures except Hagrid are exclusive and there&rsquo;s a decent assortment of characters. Gilderoy Lockhart is definitely the standout. His double sided cape is amazing as well as his excellent facial expressions. The photographer is my second favorite. His hair/hat combo piece is excellent and I think it&rsquo;s great when we get less recognizable characters in sets like these. Fortescue and Ollivvander are also very desirable along with Fred, George, and Lucius Malfoy. Lucius reuses a pretty generic head which is a bit disappointing but I think it works well enough. It&rsquo;s just strange they couldn&rsquo;t make a new one for him when they did for Fortescue and the photographer.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">This set really could have used a few more minifigures though. I am really baffled as to how Mr. Weasley was excluded. He played a big part in the scene in Flourish and Blotts and he&rsquo;s very difficult to get so he really should have been included. Percy would also have been a good choice as we have never gotten him before. Shop Owners to run Scribbulus, QQS, and Flourish and Blotts would have been nice but maybe that&rsquo;s hard to do since they were never pictured on screen.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:700; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal""><span style=""-webkit-text-decoration-skip:none""><span style=""text-decoration-skip-ink:none"">Overall</span></span></span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">As far as parts go, you can&rsquo;t beat this set. This set has the most unique parts out of any Lego set (for now at least) and there&rsquo;s so many great colors like Lavender, Orange, Pink, Sand Green, and Cool Yellow. The building experience is unmatched (except for maybe the Ninjago modulars) as there are so many details and unique building styles. The detail is incredible though most of them are stickered. This set has a ton of stickers so you should probably keep that in mind. I personally enjoy stickers and I think it&rsquo;s unreasonable to expect Lego to make tons of new prints just for one set but if you don&rsquo;t like stickers YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">This set is very playable for being so expensive, as the interiors are so readily accessible. There are a lot of removable items so your characters can go shopping. Some of the details are just decorative but I think the balance is good.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">The best thing about this set is the display and rearrangement options. You can line them all up together, or put them back to back so they&rsquo;re completely closed. Or you can put them face-to-face to create an enclosed street. It&rsquo;s so amazing and it&rsquo;s great for storage if you&rsquo;re low on space.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">You might think a 5,544 piece set for $400 would be a great deal if you&rsquo;re a PPP person. The thing is, it&rsquo;s not. There are a TON of small parts and not a whole lot of large ones. This set isn&rsquo;t unfairly priced but it&rsquo;s certainly not a great deal. Anything more than $400 would be unfair. If you&rsquo;re buying this set, you should try to get double VIP points and a GWP as well so you can get your money&rsquo;s worth.</span></span></p>

<p style=""margin-top:16px; margin-bottom:16px""><span style=""font-weight:400; font-variant:normal; white-space:pre-wrap""><span style=""font-style:normal"">Most of the cons are relatively minor. Most of the shops lack flooring, which doesn&rsquo;t look the best, and they all feel a bit shallow except WWW. The second section wastes a lot of space which is unfortunate and really could have been fixed. The minifigure selection and quality could have been improved upon, nevertheless I still think this is a fantastic set and I would completely recommend it.</span></span></p>
