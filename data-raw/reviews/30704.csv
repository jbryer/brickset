<p>Continuing the Ocean theme from Issue 29, this time we get a bright jet-ski.&nbsp; Issue 30 was available between 12th August and 08th September 2020 with a UK price of &pound;4.99.&nbsp; This price covered the comic, the jet-ski and (for me) an additional Motorcycle Cop [<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/952001-1"">952001</a>] from Issue 23.&nbsp; Others may have a different extra set.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The foil packet has a good image of Popstar Mike, waving as he powers the jet-ski though shark-infested waters.&nbsp; Behind him is a quiet looking beach, with a large building that is probably a&nbsp;hotel.&nbsp; As the set only has fifteen pieces you can clearly see what is in the packet.</p>

<p>On the back the 1:1 image is of the bright orange life jacket.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>Popstar Mike is the main character for this edition of the Lego City Comic.&nbsp; He is a good generic minifigure, that would look good in any beach set up.&nbsp; Mike includes the torso with the surfer image on a blue / red vest, and is printed on both sides.</p>

<p>He is supposed to be a Popstar, which you won&#39;t guess at all from this set.&nbsp; The inclusion of a microphone would have added to the story - or even the guitar he is seen playing on the poster that comes with the comic!&nbsp; I understand the costs of using the signed photos that he hands out in the story (on 1X2 tiles) would have been too much for a set of this size and cost.</p>

<p>Mike is made up of the following parts:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hair - Reddish Brown Mini Wig No&nbsp;18 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6112609/mini-wig-no-18"">6112609</a>]</li>
	<li>Head - Bright Yellow Mini Head No 1664 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6112623/mini-head-no-1664"">6112623</a>]</li>
	<li>Torso - White Mini Upper Part&nbsp;No 1720 with Bright Yellow Arms&nbsp;[<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4612153/mini-upper-part-no-1720"">4612153</a>]</li>
	<li>Life Jacket - Bright Orange Mini Clothing No 9 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6231925/mini-clothing-no-9"">6231925</a>]</li>
	<li>Legs - Earth Blue Mini Lower Part [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4162916/mini-lower-part"">4162916</a>]</li>
</ul>

<p>The rarest part, Life Jacket, can be found in 12 sets to date.</p>

<h3>Main Build / Parts</h3>

<p>The jet-ski is a simple build, and probably slightly larger than you would expect to find in a comic set.&nbsp; It is made from&nbsp;10 parts and looks really good with the contrast of the colours used.&nbsp; It takes no time at all to build, and is similar to lots that have gone before it.&nbsp; However, it works well and has room to add a second minifigure should you wish, which adds to the play value.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>A vast improvement on the last offering, but still slight room for improvement based on the character in the comic.&nbsp; As a standalone set it is fine how it is, and if you have a beach set up in your own city this will look perfect.&nbsp; The cover price for the comic, and what is included is good value.</p>

<p>Up next in Issue 31 is a Fire Quad featuring Clemmons.</p>
