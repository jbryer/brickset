<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>It is a third rendition of X-wing that we got since the beginning of the Star Wars Magazine. First was classic trilogy one, all the way back in 2015 (first issue). The second was released with issue 11/18 and it was a Poe Dameron version from TFA. Now we got the newest iteration - Poe Dameron&#39;s X-Wing from ROS. And in this model LEGO has done great job improving their design.</p>

<p>This craft is even more similar to the big version than previous. It&#39;s sleeker, more study. Color combo of white and orange works perfectly. Canopy is done with cheese slope, which is better than 1x2 plate taht we&#39;ve seen in previous one. Astromechanical droid is represented with single stud and looks great. Nose is long enough and is ended with new double sloped cheese slope. At the back we get 1x1 tile which is intended to be attached offset which is supposed to mimic a mechanical parts inside the craft.</p>

<p>Wings are too thin for me. They&#39;re made of rather old 1x2 plate with two bars. That allows model to stay narrower, but at the cost of wings&#39; shape. And that also makes guns extremely long. But there are also new type of engines attached to wings. They are much bigger than in classic version, for me even too big. But they resemble the original craft quite well. Wings can be folded, but it looks very weird when you do that. It&#39;s well-balanced, can stand on ends of wings.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>Model features many parts in orange, which is rather unusual color in LEGO. In terms of interesting bricks, we got four of new 1x1 double curved brick, white 1x1 double sloped cheese slope and 1x1 brackets both standard and inverted. So in this case, set is quite worthy.</p>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<p>Model looks good especially next to the older version. It has surprisingly good amount of interesting bricks. I think this small set is worth buying, and worth its price.</p>
