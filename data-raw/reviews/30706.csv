"Butterbro","2021-02-01T15:42:43.4Z","Great set in every way.","<p>I don&#39;t usually get Ninjago sets, let alone the Ninjago City sets, but this is 100% worth it. It was probably the most fun build I&#39;ve ever done, and looks amazing on display. The minifigure selection is fantastic. I mean, we get Clutch Powers, a Golden Wu, young Lloyd, and not to mention Ronin. The new variant of Ronin looks great. Out of all my Lego sets, the price per piece has never been as low as this set. I&#39;m sure if you&#39;re buying this set for yourself, you&#39;ll be very happy you did so, and if you&#39;re buying this set as a gift to someone, they will be even happier. 10/10.</p>

<p><strong>NINJAGO</strong></p>

<p><strong>2021</strong></p>

<p><strong>5685 parts</strong></p>

<p><strong>$299.99 US (2021)</strong></p>

<p>The NINJAGO City Gardens are a beautiful display model, fantastic build experience, and highly interactive playset.</p>

<p><strong>Parts</strong></p>

<p>As with the previous NINJAGO City sets, the Gardens are rife with interesting parts, some in astronomical quantities. There&#39;s a healthy number of spring green and lime green foliage parts, nearly 400 transparent blue 1x2 tiles, several interesting parts in black used for roofs, a sand blue gear rack, a red roller coaster track part, bright and sand green tiles, and a set of Super Heroes weapons in a perforated bag. The set utilises several stickers, but they&#39;re all well-designed and produced, and all of them enhance the design.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The set contains an impressive 22 minifigures, which feels appropriate for a set of this kind. They&#39;re all well-designed and printed, with my favourites being Clutch Powers, the collectable Sensei Wu, and the Exo-Force robot.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Build</strong></p>

<p>This set represents one of the most purely enjoyable builds I&#39;ve ever undertaken. The incredible piece count is intimidating, but the variety of the construction process is astonishing. Even laying the 300-odd blue water tiles over the plate foundation is satisfying. The build is full of new, interesting, and challenging build techniques, and each module is well-designed so that it&#39;s sturdy throughout the build.</p>

<p><strong>Completed Model</strong></p>

<p>This is an incredible model. It&#39;s varied without being cluttered, thanks to some careful colour blocking and combinations of shapes, and it&#39;s quite substantial. The model is tall, but also quite dense. It&#39;s sturdy, and highly modular, which assists with transport. The level of detail throughout the interior and exterior is astounding.</p>

<p><strong>Play Value</strong></p>

<p>The Gardens are entirely modular, which allows for excellent access to the interior. It&#39;s also pretty minifig-acessible, barring the lack of transport from level 1 to level 2, with all sorts of stairways and doors. The few outright play features are really well-integrated and function perfectly, and the number of minifigures and variety of characters make for great play and display possibilities.</p>

<p><strong>Price</strong></p>

<p>$300 is a lot of money, but this set is definitely worth the price in my opinion. The size and quality of the model more than justifies the price, and it&#39;s a fun build, which goes a long way.</p>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>This is one of my favourite sets. It&#39;s beautifully designed, well-priced (albeit expensive), and has a great selection of minifigures&nbsp;and a ton of play value.&nbsp;I wholeheartedly recommend it.</p>

"BelgianBricker","2022-01-12T14:30:59.167Z","Evidence that quantity does not mean quality","<p>I am a fan of Ninjago. It is one of those themes that keep surprising me, year after year, with quality builds, interesting looking structures, beautiful models and great minifigures. It is because I am a fan of this theme, that writing this review does not&nbsp;come easily. Many of you will disagree with my feelings towards it and with the contents of this review, but I feel obligated to tell everyone how I feel about it, even if it isn&#39;t all shimmer and shine, even if it will invoke a lot of negative responses and reactions.</p>

<p>I must admit that I wasn&#39;t a first hour fan of this model. It looked a bit messy (like the original Ninjago city set) and it had a steep price, so I was a bit reluctant&nbsp;on buying it. Yet, when a sweet discount came along, I let all my hesitation slide and went for it.</p>

<p>Truly: I wish I didn&#39;t...</p>

<p>Seeing the finished model on my shelf, I see all of my fears come true. I can understand why many people like this set, though:&nbsp;It is huge and offers some interesting building techniques, construction in weird angles and a vibrant colour scheme. There are a&nbsp;lot of nice details all around and an abundance of references to other themes in the form of stickers. But for me this &quot;quantity&quot; does not imply quality.</p>

<p>So what are my problems with it? Well:</p>

<p>The tree looks horrible. Come on. You have to agree with me on this one. It starts out nicely at the bottom, but going up, it gets worse and worse. The spiral staircase pieces and especially the arches make it look awful and&nbsp;unnatural. Agreed, the part on the second floor is a lot better, but that bottom trunk,...ughhh... I moved the entire model down some shelves, so you would look at it from the top down, just so you won&#39;t notice this ugly tree that much.</p>

<p>Cramped spaces. Yes, we have had cramped spaces before, but now we hit the jackpot. Every house/room/space is so petite and tiny, that it is almost impossible to pose and place figures. Both telescopes are impossible to reach, the restaurant &quot;kitchen&quot; is a joke, the staircase cannot be used buy minifigures, there simply is not enough height,...I could go on forever, but let&#39;s not.&nbsp;<br />
I like interior details, but when there is not enough room, I rather prefer that these details are left out in favour of actual space....</p>

<p>Temple sidebuild. Why? I don&#39;t understand? It looks completely out of scale and&nbsp;out of place. It should have been left out in favour of more terrain detail.</p>

<p>Artificial increase of the piece-count. I wonder why no-one has brought this up, but throughout the entire built, the piece count is increased in an artificial way by breaking up larger bricks into smaller pieces: 1 x 4 plates are replaced by 2 x 2 x 2 etc...The most flagrant example of this is a building step where a 2 x 3 tan brick is replaced by 5 tan plates.<br />
If I was to make a conservative estimation then about 500 pieces could have been left out without any problem whatsoever.</p>

<p>Nope, the more I look, think and talk about this set, the more I hate it.<br />
It will be sold as soon as possible and use my money to buy another Ninjago city docks set, that one WAS brilliant!!</p>

"Spruce","2022-01-21T16:31:12.65Z","Ninjago City Gardens, LEGO set 71741","<p><strong>Pre-Release Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>The Ninjago City Gardens were leaked around late December. I remember many people in the community having a positive reaction to it, as I did. The set looked great and was immediately my top priority for buying.</p>

<p><strong>Build Experience</strong></p>

<p>As one of the people who own the Colosseum 10276, I know what a repetitive build is. This is absolutely the polar opposite. The build is jam-packed with numerous techniques and effective construction. The colours boost the build and every bag is a new challenge to face. The build took me about 12 hours, but I took a few long breaks so perhaps a little less. Honestly, this was my favourite building experience. I could see a nine-year-old completing this model as it&#39;s not too difficult of a build.</p>

<p><strong>Model</strong></p>

<p>The completed model is a sight to see. It is over 2 feet tall and has enormous detail packed&nbsp;onto&nbsp;every tier.</p>

<p>The first level consists of Ronin&#39;s shop and a restaurant. The restaurant is adorably small and packed with small kitchen details. Ronin&#39;s shop has multiple references to the Ninjago TV show with the Fang Blade cup and some Ninjago trading cards.</p>

<p>The next level has a Ninjago fan&#39;s apartment and a tea shop. The fan&#39;s apartment is loaded with nano builds that represent some 2021 Ninjago sets. It has other cool features like a lava lamp and a Zane figurine. The tea shop is quaint and has some art on its walls. All of these first four buildings have a feature where one of the walls is angled and can be pulled off for better interior access.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We now continue to the main floor of Ninjago City Gardens, which is present in the Ninjago City Docks and Ninjago City. It is filled&nbsp;with references to themes like Znap and Power Miners. On top of this layer is Ice Planet Ice Cream Shop. This and the other build on this floor may be my favourites. The ice cream shop is colourful and has cute builds for ice cream. The branding is also a reference to a previous LEGO theme. On the other side is Chen&#39;s Noodle House, a chain restaurant from the show. The restaurant is sort of empty, but has some seating and a small kitchen. A stool protrudes from this building. Both of these buildings have an angled wall that can be detached for easier access to the inside.</p>

<p>On the level above, we have a museum and a painter&#39;s apartment. Stairs from the ice cream shop lead on up to the Ninjago&nbsp;Museum of History, an iconic location in the show. The museum has an outstanding colour scheme of bright orange, dark red, and teal. The interior has a gift shop and loads of painting and nano builds that represent major events in the show. There is even a hole in the wall for robbers to escape that is covered by an advertisement and a painting. The dome on top has a cherry blossom&nbsp;and a model of Griefbringer attached to it. The front wall of the museum is removable, so you can see the interior. The painter&#39;s&nbsp;apartment has 2 opposite walls that can be lifted off. Inside is a bed with paint buckets under it, a TV displaying Gayle Gossip, and a canvas with Ninjago City Gardens painted on.</p>

<p>For the last tier of this model there is a Zen&nbsp;garden&nbsp;and a large tower. The Zen garden is simple, with a small bonsai tree on a table inside. The roof is the most interesting part, comprised of treasure chest lids as tiles on the roof. If you lift these up, you can find a helmet and skates, a reference to an episode in Season 4 of the show. The tower has an arcade below with a playable arcade machine and a hat rack. There is a ladder that can be lifted down to allow access to this floor.&nbsp;The next level of it has a spot for a suit and 2 movie posters that can fit on one side of the tower. The highest level has only a seat&nbsp;for a figure and a screen showing incoming dangers.</p>

<p>There is a small temple island with Zane&#39;s statue on it. This may be one of my favourite parts of this build as it is small and quiet. The nature elements are perfect and make a small and effective build.</p>

<p>The floors all fit together in a modular style and can be easily lifted off. The complete model is an incredible presentation piece.</p>

<p><strong>Minifigures</strong></p>

<p>The minifigure selection is similar to the other sets in that&nbsp;it isn&#39;t very strong&nbsp;but has some outstanding figures. The 10-year golden Wu is exceptional and easily the highlight. The Mechanic is a long-awaited figure done perfectly. Urban Jay, Cole, and Nya are fine, with Jay standing out for his unique torso. Zane and Kai are both present in their Ninja suits which I&#39;m sure many of us already have. Young Lloyd is perfect and all I need in a young version of him. Cece is a decent figure to accompany the Mechanic. Ronin is amazing with a revised and more detailed print. Clutch Powers is nothing new, just a nice accompaniment. Hai is great with his Ice Planet uniform. Misako is a neat addition, as I missed out on the Temple of Airjitzu a few years ago. Scoop is a unique figure that is comprised of unique pieces. Mei, Kaito, Tito, Christina, and Eileen are simply civilian figures and are nothing special. Master Wu&#39;s dog is also present, a random reference to a Season 5 set. There are three non-figures present: The Master Chen mascot, Zane&#39;s statue, and Jay&#39;s ninja suit. Jay&#39;s suit is nothing special, just his Legacy outfit. Zane&#39;s statue is slightly inaccurate but fine. Chen&#39;s mascot is a great figure that completes the look of Chen&#39;s Noodle House.</p>

<p><strong>Value</strong></p>

<p>The play value is off the charts for this set. I could spend HOURS moving minifigures around and telling stories with this set. It truly encapsulates the joy that I get from LEGO. The price is INCREDIBLE, being the same value as Ninjago City, which already had a great value, but this has around 800 MORE pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Great display piece</li>
	<li>Amazing value</li>
	<li>Fun for play</li>
	<li>Some stand-out minifigures</li>
	<li>Unique building experience</li>
	<li>Great parts</li>
	<li>Continues Ninjago City modular line</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Hard to carry&nbsp;</li>
	<li>Fragile parts</li>
	<li>Long build time</li>
	<li>Some boring minifigures</li>
	<li>Pricey</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Overall</strong></p>

<p>Ninjago City Gardens may come down as my favourite LEGO set of all time. Its amazing build and good minifigures certainly boost it, but my favorite part is the play value. I could spend hours dissecting and playing with this set. It&#39;s so unique of a set and I<em>&nbsp;<strong>HIGHLY</strong>&nbsp;</em>reccomend it. If you have the money and the time to build this, you will NOT regret it.</p>

"Orca","2021-06-11T21:20:43.78Z","Ninjago City Gardens: 10 years of greatness","<p>I don&#39;t watch the Ninjago TV show. I have never seen a single episode. But when I saw this set, I knew I&nbsp;needed it. A few years ago, I got the original Ninjago City as a gift. I never bought the docks due to me being in my &#39;&#39;dark ages.&#39;&#39; The original city set is one of my favorites of all time. The architecture was amazing, the minifigures were glorious, and the little details were incredible. I knew I had to buy this set as I didn&#39;t want to regret it. I got it in February of 2021 and built it very quickly. After I finished, I fell in love with it.</p>

<p>Minifigures: There are a ton of minifigures in this set: about 20. While many of them are amazing, I feel like the original had far better ones. The highlights for me are the golden Wu, Urban Cole, and Tito. You also get a husky piece.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Exterior: This is my favorite part of the set. There are so many greatly built sections of this set. I love how they use different pieces that we don&#39;t usually see for the roofs, such as the sushi knives and the gaming controllers. It is so colorful and fun, as this set is a plethora of greatness. It is more of an open feel compared to the original, which is why I still prefer the original. The original had many nooks and crannies, bridges, and small spaces. While this new one still has these, I still prefer the layout of the original. The best part of the exterior is the foilage. There are so many colorful trees which I adore. I also love the radio tower, which I like better than the original.</p>

<p>Interior: Like the original and docks, the interiors are so detailed. Like the city, the theming of the buildings are top-notch. There is a noodle restaurant, ice cream store, museum, apartment, tearoom, and much more. Very quaint and small, the interiors use creative building techniques to create a lovely interior. However, one issue is that they can be very hard to access. The playability is a little restricted as the size of the buildings are not that big.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Value. This set costs 300$ USD. I think it is a wonderful price, and a better deal than the original. There are over 5000 pieces, and it is the largest set I currently own. It is a wonderful deal for anyone who likes buildings and Ninjago. The price is just about right. If it was 350 or even 400, I would still buy it. It has fantastic value.</p>

<p>Conclusion: This set is amazing. It has great minifigures, and interesting architecture, fun colors, and is an amazing display piece. I highly recommend this set to anyone that has a Lego City. In my city, I put it right on the water and it reminds me of Japan. Connecting it to the city makes it greater, and I am sure it is the same with the docks. I am sure this set will be around for a while, so don&#39;t feel like you have to get it right away. I predict it will retire in mid-2023.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Final grade: A+</p>

"MrStardian","2022-10-03T14:57:01.993Z","The biggest and most magnificent Ninjago set!","<p>Okay,&nbsp;let&#39;s start off with saying that this is my first ever review, and im not that familiar with reviewing any sort of thing, so i might not be that detailed in my review.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Foremost, the building experience! Now for me, it&#39;s a 3/5. And this is mainly because of roof of the noodle shop which is made out of black sausage, putting these sausages where they needed to be was an absolute pain in my butt, the same goes with the ice cream shop. Which contains cleavers for the roof pieces. While both of them look amazing, it was really annoying for me to build. And i have a lot of trouble building any kind of tree, so the trees in this set were a little tough.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now, the parts are an easy 5/5. There&#39;s a few big aqua pieces for the top of the build (the radar) and a bunch of special bricks i would have never thought to use. Also, the Minifigures are excellent, and you get 22 of them!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playability is a 4/5 for me. While its huge, and you could easily do a bunch of playing with it, it&#39;s hard to get around it because your hand is very likely to hit and not even fit into certain places. Now, there are a few play features like the ladder on the radar tower.<br />
<br />
And last, the value for money is an easy 5/5. $350 for 5685 pieces and 22 Minifigures, a ton of building hours and looks really good on display.<br />
