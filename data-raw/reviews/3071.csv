"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-11T21:26:01Z","."," I have to say this was one of my favorite sets as a kid. I have the complete sub and the instructions and just recently found the minifig WITH his diving gear. The black piece that can strangely fit an octogonal dome was new for 1998. I don't like the big hole (actually, it's not that big) in the back that would cause water to rush in when the sub is hundreds of feet deep in water, but it's lego.  ",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2005-01-31T22:25:32Z","Prety Good","This is a prety good set.  It's cool how the propellor and flipper holders are mounted, but  This set has one major flaw: that big (but not too big) hole in the back.  And what is that gray piece on top with the hole in it supposed to be, A camara?",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"jman","2007-05-10T07:47:54.197Z","Nice Minifig At Least","I will start with the PROS which is the minifig which has a cool diving contraption on the back with lights and missles on it and a translucent yellow diving mask.

The CONS is all about the vehicle. Which has a huge hole in the back. How can a submarine have a huge hole? I know it's Lego so imagination away. Also the sub is like one big black piece so not much building fun with that and their is no steering wheel or sub control panel to drive it. It is like a rock you just drop in the sea and it sinks.

Unless someone gives you this set (like me) not worth it.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0
"mrmitch","2007-06-11T03:26:58.64Z","Sub would sink underwater","Like every other review of this set I don't know why they didn't give enough bricks to fill up the hole in the back of this litte sub. Solution was simple go to your extra pieces and fill it and keep it with the set(duh). Good diver and the propeller is cool, at the time the green flip up window was a must have. Not a bad set and it was under 5 US dollars - so pick it up and add a few pieces.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-09-03T12:34:46.613Z","Complete Failure","Found this one in the box today and decided id better put in my piece on it. Well they call it Aquazone but i don't. Aquazone was the original series between the Aquanauts and Aquasharks, Not the Hydronauts and Stingrays. More like Aquazone II.

This particular model has none of the true Aquazone colours, 90% of the model is one block which has a gaping hole in it. The don't even give you a block to fill it you have to give it one. The mini-fig can't fit in the cockpit without disassembling his back pack. The sub has no instruments/ controls. It's aesthetics are out the window and has a playability rating of like 1/10.

The only real positives of this model is he has the original spears from Aquazone and the fluoro yellow face shield for his pack. His pack is a repulsive metallic blue. I love metallic and the colour blue but wrong piece to use it on.

Overall this model sucked and deserves a 3/10. I may be slightly bias due to my love of the original series but i haven't yet reviewed another model this small with so many flaws. Buy it to say you have it that's all.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"krysto2002","2008-07-22T16:10:03.153Z","Cool 'fig, bad sub","Like I said, for minifigures the hydronauts were cool. They had some cool colors and the torsos and heads were awesome. 

This set reflects poorly on the series since it has little to speak for. The sub has NO details, no controls, an open back, few usable parts, and so on. 

The set could easily have been made better by scrapping the tile inside and adding a controls array with some levers and moniters. The back could easily have been plugged up, but wasn't (why?).

The only saving graces are that the stow and go of the headset is cool, the minifig is cool (and sort of valuable), and if you have a decent collection, the cockpit, window, minifigure, and propeller, could easily make an awesome spaceship or sub.",FALSE,3,0,0,0,0

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-12T12:43:18.637Z","Hydronauts Scout","<p>Set #6110 Solo Sub: Welcome to the Hydronauts, your mission should you choose to accept it, is to gather the energy crystals before the nefarious Stingrays or their Aquashark allies succeed in claiming them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This set may look cheap in the design category by the picture, but just because it was built using some oddly chosen pieces doesn't mean it was bad. The Solo Sub is a ship that looks almost as though it would be an escape craft for a much larger vessel. It is built using very few pieces and as such some might think the price wasn't very good, but I say different.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solo Sub was perfectly priced for troop building the new Hydronauts. And the model for the sub could easily be modified or merged with larger vessels if you so chose. It also had some nice colors for the pieces. The Hydronaut Mini-Figure of course is the standard looking Hydronaut with breathing mask face print and silver chromed helmet. The torso's printing was fun to look at too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that although the ship's design may be considered weak by some due to the lack of any real building, since the sub mostly uses those two large pieces and a few plates and things to construct it. It is still a worthy addition to your Hydronauts/Aquazone collection and deserves a bit of attention. I'd score it higher personally, but I have to be honest, despite being a fun little troop building style set there really isn't much there for parts and things. If you still don't like it, well buy it for the Mini-Figure then, because those parts could easily be useful for some MOCing.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,3,5
