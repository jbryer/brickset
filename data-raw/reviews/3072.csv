"A_Brickset_user","2004-05-11T21:14:27Z","."," This was my first aquazone set ever. Out of all of the aquashark sets, this is the only one I have. I like the clever design of the levers coming out of the sides, but they pop halfway out of the lever base when the minifig holds it. I think the blue cylinders on the sides are supposed to be buoyancy (I don't know if that is spelled correctly) tanks. I like the front plate thing with the aquashark logo on it.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Blade","2007-08-13T11:05:50.393Z","Super Scooter","Well this was my second Aquazone set. I bought it to see if it was as good as the first (6125) and i must admit it came close. This cool underwater scooter dose alot for me. It has the usual Aquazone fluoro orange fan and helmet holding two spears.

The scooter itself is all black with a touch of blue which personally is  my favourite colour scheme. The front emblem is printed on (NO STICKER) which is an A++ from me. It looks sleek, quick and maneuverable which is a must is this type of vehicle.

The mini fig is nice with an awesome baddy looking face. The Helmet is black with a red shield. He has the two spears which can also be but into the front of the vehicle as defence or to be fired. 

No real problems except this is the other model i could think think of without a crystal and really this is what this whole series was about or after. Also someone mentioned the gear sticks. Yes they do pop out a little but for me its less than quarter so i think it depends on the position of the fig. Also a creature would have been nice.

Overall a great model a solid 7/10 and another recommendation if you are after sea or space or just like to play with your models.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Novelty","2008-02-26T16:22:29.297Z","Shark fin","This is the small Aquashark set and like most small sets, it suffers because of the lack of possibility.  The designers did the best they could - the nice use of black and blue ties in with the rest of the Aquasharks,  but also gives the vehicle a nice look.   The use of transparent orange highlights also ties in with the rest of the Aquasharks, although a little more of it could have been used. The vehicle isn't &quot;sleek&quot; by any defination, yet it does look like an underwater vehicle.  Surprising for such a small set, there's quite a bit of &quot;building&quot; to do.  Playwise, the vehicle is sturdy and the only bits that potentially break off are the leg fins attached to the bottom of the scooter.  No big loss there, those can be attached to the detached figure for better play.",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0
"hustla187","2008-09-04T18:00:04.59Z","Not Bad","If you like the Aquasharks, this is a great way to build a small army. I really like this set becuase of the little water vehicle but is that supposed to be a sub? The back propellor is a nice feature and it's not bad.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Porsche911","2007-08-28T10:53:42.473Z","Good, not great","As a fan of the Aquazone, I like this set a fair bit. It has a relatively good design and some useful parts and a good overall appearance. However, it just isn't as good as the small Aquanaut set for example.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"legoman4694","2008-06-07T21:57:47.67Z","good but flawd","this set is pretty good you get an aquashark and a little scooter. the figure is just a standard figure and the vehicle has a cool piece in the front. the parts are pretty basic and the front of this set is cool. i only have one but i would like 2 or 3. its good for an add on for the shark crystal cave but not that good by its self 7/10",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"Cyborg_Phloyd","2009-06-28T08:37:32.763Z","Well-Rounded Little ","My favorite Aquazone sub-theme was Aquasharks. I remember that I was constructing a super-headquarters for them, and I purchased to of these to act as the base's scouts, just like their named. the set is great, it comes with accessories for the Aquashark like daggers and flippers. And how I love the Aquashark minifigs. Still, it lacks that charm that the larger sets have.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0
"BobaFett2","2010-09-30T08:56:48.48Z","Surprisingly, this set is a great impulse","This is an impulse buy set from the [[1995]]/[[1996]] Aquasharks theme, a subtheme of Aquazone. I got it on bricklink for 2 dollars (no shipping because it's from a guy who lives 15 minutes away).<br><h4>Value for Money and Parts</h4>The set has a great value for money, because even though it is small, it has a cool design and a few great parts. It also contains a great Aquashark minifigure. As for parts, it has a unique ""snowmobile"" front, an Aquashark, and some other nice parts.<br><h4>Building Experience and Playability</h4>There's not much to say abuot the build other than that it is a bit interesting. The set is very swooshable. The set is playable, but works best with the Neptune Discovery Lab.<br><h4>Pros</h4><ul><li>Playable</li><li>Cheap</li><li>Contains a unique part</li></ul><h4>Cons</h4><ul><li>Not too interesting</li></ul>Overall, I give it a decent rating. Nice collector's item, nice gift, but pretty dull.<br><br>",TRUE,4,4,3,4,4
"Odeinoichus","2011-01-12T12:57:28.287Z","Aquashark Scouting the Depths","<p>Set #6115 Shark Scout: This little polybagged impulse set is a joy to behold and an excellent source for cheap Aquashark Mini-Figures.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Shark Scout uses a small undersea scooter to travel from one point to the next. The model is built simply and quickly with very few pieces, there were one or two that were unique looking for this small a set and I especially enjoyed the printed Aquashark logo on the front of the vessel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Mini-Figure of course is the real reason for picking this one up. The ship can be built with any number of alternate pieces lying around, in fact I had built a second un-printed version with spare parts in my collection at one point. But still this set is a great source for cheap Aquashark troopers. There were so few Aquasharks and Aquanauts spread out amongst the sets of this theme that troop building with impulse sets was a must. I strongly recommend this set for those collectors who want a large selection of Aquashark Mini-Figures.</p>",TRUE,3,3,3,4,5
"Pheedle","2016-05-17T07:08:39.547Z","Worth the price of admission. ","<p>Whilst the Shark Scout doesn&#39;t look overly noteworthy from the outside, this was an important personal set for a few reasons: firstly, it was an affordable set, a serious consideration at the time. But more importantly, it started to show how Lego&nbsp;could be manipulated and used from different perspectives to achieve unimagined or unconsidered visual esthetics and function.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Minifigures</h3>

<p>The minifigures of the Aquazone range were excellent in their own right, with the use of the bulky oxygen apparatus with attachments for the common chrome knifes , or spears in this case. The different color options for the face mask also allowed for characterization.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>The build</h3>

<p>For some reason, it has always stuck with me how the blue cylinders give the illusion of connection, but is in fact separate. The use of placing these same cylinders on the pins of the modified plates was far beyond&nbsp;my young mind. A small detail to be sure and a very small example of the creative potential of the Lego system, however it is the fact that this set introduced that idea that sticks with me the most.&nbsp;</p>
