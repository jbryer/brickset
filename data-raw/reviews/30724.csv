<p>This model was designed by Nina Koopman based on sketches from Lego graphic designers Chris Boven and Austin Carlson.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This set comes in three bags within the box with the instructions and baseplate floating freely within.&nbsp; There aren&#39;t too many pieces to quickly organize them before building if you like to do that.&nbsp; The instructions are clear and the building process is quick like other BrickHeadz models.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve seen some people complain about the monochromatic colors but I think it clearly depicts the monster from the Boris Karloff movies which were black and white.&nbsp; There are pieces that are red, yellow, etc., inside the model that get covered by the outer layer of pieces.&nbsp; I think the pearl silver studs were a great idea for the metal rods protruding from his neck.&nbsp; The printed pieces for his suit jacket and forehead work well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is a really good depiction of Karloff&#39;s character and because it&#39;s a BrickHeadz model, we don&#39;t need to get bothered by not being spot on.&nbsp; As with all BrickHeads, the head takes up the majority of the completed model.</p>

<p>Other seasonal BrickHeadz sets have decorative mini-builds to accompany them, such as <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40351-1/Halloween-Ghost"">40351 Halloween Ghost</a> having a Jack-o-lantern, gravestone and such.&nbsp; Because this isn&#39;t considered a &quot;seasonal&quot; set, I can cut it some slack.&nbsp; I&#39;ve seen a couple people give him a flower in one hand but I can&#39;t think of how else to spruce him up unless you wanted to add some pitchforks and torches.&nbsp; ;-)</p>

<p>I want to note that my ratings are based on comparing this with the other BrickHeadz sets I have because I would rate them differently from standard Lego sets that have playable features.&nbsp; If you like Halloween, monsters or film noir, I would highly recommend this set.&nbsp; I think it&#39;s great.</p>
