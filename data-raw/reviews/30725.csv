It is stylish, fun and has some fascinating parts and functions. Overall, I rate this a 5/5, because it is a truly magical set produced by LEGO this year! It fits perfectly alongside previous vignettes such as&nbsp;<a aria-describedby=""ui-tooltip-4"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40263-1/Christmas-Town-Square"">40263-1</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a aria-describedby=""ui-tooltip-8"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40262-1/Christmas-Train-Ride"">40262-1</a>. There are a few negative points that I will bring up, but at the end of the day, this is a marvellous set. Well Done LEGO.</p>

<p>The set comes in a small, tape sealed box, perfect stocking size. There are three bags of pieces, as well as the instructions. The box are is simple, yet very neat and effective.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The building experience was wonderful, I enjoyed building it, whilst listening to festive music and drinking some hot chocolate. It&#39;s a great little set to buy to build on Christmas eve, at a small gathering or with the ones you love. It&#39;s guaranteed to keep the kids entertained for hours. The set uses some really neat techniques, like using&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6210272/plate-1x2-rounded-no-1"">6210272</a>&nbsp;to help create an awesome snow fort! The use of&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/4188189/coupling-plate-2x2"">4188189</a>&nbsp;on the snowman as a scarf and&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6270112/horn-w-shaft-%C3%B8-3-2"">6270112</a>&nbsp;as a carrot makes a change from carrots stuck in back to front.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a aria-describedby=""ui-tooltip-1"" href=""https://brickset.com/sets/40424-1/Winter-Snowball-Fight"">40424-1</a>&nbsp;Includes some really cool pieces, and some amazing new prints for the minifigure torsos. I particularly love torso&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6317894/mini-upper-part-no-5214"">6317894</a>&nbsp;but&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6317901/mini-upper-part-no-5215"">6317901</a>&nbsp;is also very nice. I liked the inclusion of&nbsp;<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6076467/animal-no-17-deco-no-1"">6076467</a>&nbsp;and of the skis (<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6170544/ski-6m-with-knob"">6170544</a>). Having a tree included is nice, as are&nbsp;the aqua and transparent blue pieces.</p>

<p>The set has some awesome play features such as the toboggan slide and the snowball cannon.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Let&#39;s talk. About the price.&nbsp;Seasonal vignettes were &pound;9.99. 11.99 is quite a big jump... I will say no more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The winter snow ball fight is a set with so much to offer in terms of builds and these builds have the best play to cost value in a set currently available that is this cheap.</p>

<p>The Minifigures -</p>

<p>Starting with the girl she has a dark brown plated hair piece , a very cheery expression with an eyes closed laughing face , a very nice orange scarf , a blue coat and some lavender short legs , the boy has a dual moulded red and light tan hat with a cheery child face print , an olive green coat and some black short legs , there is also a husky included , dual moulded in white and dark grey in a marble effect and some eyes printed .</p>

<p>The builds-</p>

<p>There are five individual builds and a roster of little bits , first we have a little sleigh it is built on a 2&times;3 red plate , with a modified 1&times;2 plate in light grey ontop with a dark grey ski attached to each side , a pair of 1&times;2 red slopes at the nose , two white inverted slopes underneath , a flame yellow lower half of a present is ontop and it contains two white hollow studs for snowballs . There is also a table built on a 2&times;4 redish brown plate with two 1&times;2 light nugat rigid bricks underneath for legs and ontop there is a white and pink mug piece along with a 2&times;2 rounded light tan plate with two printed 1&times;1 biscuits on rounded light tan tiles . Next we have a snowman , it is built on a 4&times;4 rounded white brick with four corner slopes in white ontop , the body is built out of technic bricks to attach two redish brown shrub pieces for the arms and snots to attach two 1&times;2 white jumpers and two 1&times;1 black studs for the coal , it&nbsp;has a scarf using a 2&times;3 modified plate in red and its&nbsp;head is built on a 2&times;2 white rounded technic brick with a small orange tooth for their carrot nose and a Minifigure top hat is on a jumper to finish it off . Next we have one of the main builds a ramp for the sleigh it is built on a 6&times;8 white plate and has a collection of 1&times;2&times;2 slopes , 1&times;1 cheese slopes , 2&times;2 slopes , 1&times;3 slopes and 1&times;2 slopes and these are in light aqua , light grey , dark grey and white , there are also 1&times;1 light trans blue studs around and a 1&times;1 light aqua snot brick is towards the back and attached a 1&times;1 trans blue tooth plate to make a very good icicle , the Top is built on a 4&times;4 white plate with some slopes at the back ontop of a 1&times;2 light grey technic brick with an axle running through loosely , there is also a 1&times;2 white jumper plate with a light tan pole attached with a red flag ontop and there are two 1&times;6 white tiles attached to a hinge so when you push the previously mentioned technic axle with the sleigh on a 4&times;4 it goes down the ramp which is a fun play feature . And finally we have the fort it is built on a 6&times;8 white plate with jumpers on one corner and halfway through to attach a wall for the fort , it uses a large amount of 1&times;2 rounded white plates interlocked at a curve with tiles ontop and a 1&times;2 slope in each end with a clip at the corner attaching a light tan rod with a blue flag ontop , there is also a catapult feature here using two light grey technic bricks with a modified 2&times;4 black plate to act as the launch platform and some white slopes on the left with two more 1&times;1 trans light blue studs around , the base that you push on has a 2&times;2 blue tile and a 2&times;2 flame yellow lower half of a present with the same pieces included as before , two 1&times;1 hollow white studs for snowballs . But there is also a pair of dark azure skis , two sand green ski poles and a green moulded tree .</p>

<p>In conclusion -</p>

<p>this is a fabulous little set for KFOLS and TFOLS and AFOLS and provides so much monetary value as well , nothing here feels unnecessary or bad so I recommend it to any Lego fan .</p>
