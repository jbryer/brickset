<p>Model</p>

<p>It&#39;s just 27 bricks stuck together, to be honest. But still, it looks quite cool. As a quad, it is quite typical. It has four wheels on wide axis, big mudguards and lights at the front. You can put one minifig inside, and give him a handle to steer this vehicle. At the back, there is a holder for a ball joint. It is a place where you can attach a trailer, that will be available in the next issue of the magazine (in November I think).</p>

<p>But there are also two great things about this model. First of all, its color scheme is similar to this known from the old Jurassic Park movie. It is a mix between lime green and dark red, with some additions in yellow. For me this is a great thing. And the second, it has a clip, where you can attach a minifig&#39;s weapon. It is a feature, that many bigger set misses, so it is great to see it in such a small set.</p>

<p>Speaking of a weapon, it is horribly oversized. But that&#39;s good. Gun looks weird but fine, it has a telescope of some sort on the top, and funny looking blue cone at the front. It&#39;s crazy big, but does its job pretty good.</p>

<p>Minifig</p>

<p>I&#39;m not a fan of Jurassic World movie, so I&#39;d to check who this guy is. His name&#39;s Vic Hoskins. He has plain black trousers and tan shirt with some belts and holster. Color of the shirt is a bit darker than skin, which is great. On the shirt itself there are some pockets, buttons and wrinkles. It&#39;s OK, because in the movie this guy was rather thick. Which you can&#39;t tell based&nbsp;on his face. On the other hand this face looks good, can be reused in many mocs. He has short gray beard&nbsp;and big eyebrows. On the first expression he is cunning-happy, on the other just mad. He has also nice hair, black and combed to the back. I don&#39;t know why LEGO decided to change the color of the hair from gray to black, but I don&#39;t care. He looks fine.</p>

<p>Bricks</p>

<p>As I mentioned, 27 in quad plus four in gun. Not a lot. But still, some of them are great. For example, we got a pair of dark red mudguard and lime green 1x2 with one clip. Also, gun part is quite unique, though it isn&#39;t so new (was introduced in LEGO Movie series).</p>

<p>Summary</p>

<p>Very small set, that for sure, but one of the better in this year line of magazines&#39; gifts. A fig plus a side build is always appreciated. Price is typical ~$4. It is a very solid set.</p>
