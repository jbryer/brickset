"CyandraZ","2005-05-14T16:24:26Z","Neat little sub","My only aquanauts kit, and it makes me want more! The pieces have a great variety, for example. A trans blue  camopy, two yellow octogonal floats, as well as a few acessories and grabber arm joints (in trans orange and yellow!) I always liked the figure, and it still is one of my favorites, simply because of the sly look on his face and the interesting colors. Playibility is fair, although a crystal and sea creature would have been nice. 
Overall rating: Nice parts, colors, and minifigure, with an okay playability rating. 5/5 (Because the kit is still cool)",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0
"A_Brickset_user","2007-06-05T11:22:32.983Z","Small form, huge entertainment","This tiny little submersible may not seem like much, but don't let the size fool you. With a working propeller and canopy, a claw attached to a tentacle-like, fully-poseable arm and a beautiful diver minifig this set offers tremendous value for money. The only serious design flaw is the lack of storage space for the divers' flippers - the box shot and manual suggest attaching them to the rear of the side pods, but they easily break off this way. A small storage compartment or extra room in the cockpit would have been better and this does knock one point off the total.

Still, don't let this stop you from finding this set. It is a splendid addition to any underwater collection.",FALSE,4,0,0,0,0

"Blade","2007-08-13T10:42:00.097Z","Super Sub","This was my first Aquazone set and it made sure it wasn't my last. It captures everything a child would want in a sub. Clear pieces, grabbing arm, cool mini-fig complete with knives (The first knife i have seen and the first LEGO knife made i believe).

The majority of the model is blue and black which works well with the sea theme but also has the standard yellow and fluoro orange pieces, which complement this model and the theme very nicely.

The mini-fig has the standard Aquazone face and comes with the mask-jacket which is white with blue face shield and is able to hold the two knives.

The only real let down of this model was the lack of crystal. almost all other Aquazone sets have one except this one. Also due to the size of this model there is no room for a control pad. One person made a point about the flippers. They do fit neatly behind the fig but mine clip on the back nice and tight, no problems at all.

These two let downs bring it down to an 8/10 but i had so much fun playing with this model as a child and as it inspired me to get the rest i have to give it full marks for a small model. I would seriously recommend this model to anybody as its great for any collector and any one who like space, sea, town or just like to play with their models.",FALSE,5,0,0,0,0

"Odeinoichus","2011-01-12T13:09:02.28Z","Sea Sprint GO!","<p>Set #6125 Sea Sprint 9: Beinvenu, journey with us into ze briny deep where ze Aquanaut expedition has begun to discovaire some mysterious energy crystals. Where did zey come from? What was dere purpose? Dat is the mystere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forgive my horrible Jacques Cousteau impersonation, but I had to have some fun, after all that's what LEGO is all about. This small set was a cheap addition to your Aquazone collection. In fact there were a lot of small sets spread out in this Theme as opposed to the current generation of Undersea Adventures Sets where we have a lot more 20-50$ price point sets comparatively.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Sea Sprint 9 model introduced me to some interesting new pieces. I'm not sure if the linked manipulator arm pieces were introduced with Space or Aquazone, but these pieces were interesting and brand new back then, and highly poseable. Not to mention flexible. This little vessel only comes with a very small manipulator arm, but it is still useful for picking up the mysterious energy crystals that these expeditions in LEGO Universe are constantly running across. (Aquazone, Rock Raiders, Power Miners, it seems that you can't go more than two feet before finding something strange and exciting in LEGO Universe.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ship is small unfortunately and thus suffers a little in the design, but it was still amazing fun and versatile for playing with and the Mini-Figure made up somewhat for certain lacking features. The printed circular plate with the Aquanaut logo on it was also a fun piece to use when MOCing. I kind of wish LEGO would bring back that awesome looking helmet piece in their new underwater Themes, but I can understand why they might not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overall I'd have to say that this little set is something not to be missed. Since the Aquazone Theme itself only has 28 sets, some of them different boxed versions of other sets it makes it easy to recommend them all. And easy to collect them all too. (Except for the duplications if you don't want two of the same sub.) The pieces are useful for building up MOC subs or wierd space craft as well.</p>",TRUE,4,4,4,4,5
"mcereal","2013-01-24T19:33:17.92Z","Nice Value for a Small Ship","<p>The Sea Sprint 9 is a nice addition to the Aquazone but that's about it.&nbsp;</p><div><br></div><div>This set includes some cool parts. I like the arm/claw feature a lot. The printed tile with the Aquanauts logo is nice too.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Its small size lets it act as a ""support"" vessel for the bigger underwater ships and at $4 or so (way back in 1996) it was a great value. This set would probably be about $6 today if you adjusted for inflation. The minifigure is cool and the helmet design is great. It'd be nice if LEGO brought back this design for underwater minifigure accessories. So for its size and including a great minifig this set ($4 in 1995 or $6 in 2013) it's a great value.</div><div><br></div><div>A disappointing thing is that the chrome-like finish on the minifig's knife wears very, very easily. It'll be white-ish after a small amount of play. It also sort of bugs me that the cap, the sort of ""windscreen"", is not flush with the sides of the ship when its in the closed position. Considering this is supposed to be an underwater theme, our Aquanaut minifig hero would have water flooding into his ship!</div><div><br></div><div>Overall though, I feel that the size of the vessel is a little underwhelming. The <a href=""http://www.brickset.com/detail/?Set=6815-1"">Hovertron</a> (6815) is almost the Space themed (Exploriens subtheme) equivalent of this ship and it seems to have a little more versatility and customization potential. A nice addition but not the best set overall.</div><p></p>",TRUE,3,4,3,3,5
"Pheedle","2016-05-17T07:21:30.11Z","Change, maybe for the better. ","<p>This set encompasses&nbsp;most of what I miss from 90&#39;s Lego pieces. The&nbsp;large, molded, transparent pieces,&nbsp;there were rife throughout the Aquazone&nbsp;and other ranges. Sure there were specific, not overly interchangeable and the connector pins were notorious for either breaking themselves, of breaking the slots within their attachment cradles, but they just gave these sets such a great air of character and realism. &nbsp;The large hexagonal pieces have also vanished. Their use in this set as engine pods is great, and the attachment method for them is rather ingenious. But what I miss most, but the ones I understand really had to go, was the CLAWW!! Oh, the claws. They popped up in so many themes and caused terrible trouble in most of them, with their habit of snapping connectors and not being as fluidly articulated as you may expect.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Overall opinion</h3>

<p>This set very nicely fills out a display of the larger Aquazone sets, matching the esthetics of sets such as&nbsp;<a href=""http://brickset.com/sets/6195-1/Neptune-Discovery-Lab"">6195-1: Neptune Discovery Lab</a>&nbsp;perfectly. Well worth the $15 off Ebay.&nbsp;</p>

"Classic_Brick_Studios","2021-06-07T19:08:08.757Z","Down underneath the surface!","<p><em>On the mysterious planet Nauticus P3 the Aquanauts search for oxygen crystals to ensure their survival. But a rivalling faction known as the Aquasharks&nbsp; are after these crystals as well. In order to stay off the radar of these predators, the agile small Seasprint 9 was constructed for scouting missions...</em></p>

<p>I love small sets! They are so great to collect characters and get a taste of the theme. Due to their inclusion of some nice accessories and equipment, they also mostly stay useful when you go out and buy a bigger set. (and guys did I buy a bigger set of this theme, to be reviewed at a later time)</p>

<p>So it is looking quite good for the lil&#39; Seasprint 9 already.</p>

<p><strong>The Minifigure</strong></p>

<p>I don&#39;t know any official names for these guys, but I think in some countries this figure had one. He is a pretty standard Aquanaut though, which is great to amass your workforce for this theme. I love the design with metallic gold on his torso as well as his diving gear, including flippers and a very very useful visor piece, which could also be used as an astronaut helmet.</p>

<p><strong>The Seasprint 9</strong></p>

<p>This design might not be too impressive, but it does achieve to look like a more futuristic submarine in the same style, which we use today. It also comes with a lot of interesting parts, including the octagonal pieces and the cockpit, as well as the printed Aquanaut Logo.</p>

<p><strong>The Accessories</strong></p>

<p>Accessories are always interesting for sets this small and as far as these go, you receive diving fins and chromed knifes, which is fair enough I think.</p>

<p><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></p>

<p>Now on its own, there isn&#39;t too much to do with this set, since LEGO didn&#39;t include one of the oxygen crystals (which would&#39;ve been perfect). But if you own other sets of this theme, it starts to look a lot better, as the submarine itself has a pretty neat design and I think the value for the money is absolutely there.</p>
