The blue milk moustache facial expressions, both the smiling and seemingly confused expressions are very comedic and loveable! This head also fits hilariously well on other Luke minifigures, such as the Jedi Luke from the recent&nbsp;Dark Trooper&trade; Attack set (75324).</p>

<p>The Bantha milk carton is hilarious as well, and is funny to use in other Star Wars settings such as the Mos Eisley Cantina (75290).</p>

<p>The rest of the pieces in this set are from every recent Tatooine Luke we have got, so nothing special there. The details are great on those parts however, even if they seem to be used more commonly than clone troopers!</p>

<p>I still do not understand why people are actually buying these online sealed for over $50+. I do not think I ever will understand this, either.</p>

<p>Overall, a funny little addition for a Tatooine&nbsp;collector or a Luke fan, although if you missed out on pre-ordering the Lego Star Wars: Skywalker Saga Deluxe Edition&nbsp;game and this little guy with it, then perhaps wait a bit until values go down (as they hopefully will). If they don&#39;t, then this will be the most randomly expensive and bamboozling Lego promotional minifigure I have seen in terms of after market value.</p>

<p>Good figure, don&#39;t pay more than the Deluxe Edition for it alone!!!</p>
