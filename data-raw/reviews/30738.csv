<p>Clemmons&nbsp;makes his debut attached to the front of&nbsp;the Lego City Comic in&nbsp;issue 31 and comes with a great looking ATV.&nbsp; In the UK it was priced &pound;4.25 and was on sale between 09 September and 06 October 2020.&nbsp; This is the fifth fire related comic set, meaning fire is&nbsp;second most popular&nbsp;behind police in the total number of sets given with the City comics.</p>

<h3>Packet</h3>

<p>The front of the foil packet has a great inset image of Clemmons holding onto a white fire extinguisher.&nbsp; He is also pictured riding his quad bike along a city road, racing to get to a fire.&nbsp; The front indicates that this is for 5+, which is probably a little high although the closest comparable set from 2020 is also set&nbsp;at that age point [<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60247-1/Forest-Fire"">60247</a>].</p>

<p>On the back, along with the standard safety information, is a 1:1 image of his bright red fireman helmet.</p>

<h3>Minifigure</h3>

<p>As this is Clemmons&#39; first appearance as a solid minifigure on the front of the comic it is a little disappointing that he is not unique.&nbsp; His appearance is exactly as the Forest Fire set <a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60247-1/Forest-Fire"">60247</a>.&nbsp; However, he is unique to only these two sets.</p>

<p>His torso is the only part that is printed on both sides.&nbsp; This is fine as the helmet would not cover another facial expression, and he looks great exactly how he is.</p>

<p>The parts that make up Clemmons are as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Helmet - Bright Red Mini Fireman Helmet [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6248066/mini-fireman-helmet"">6248066</a>]</li>
	<li>Head - Bright Yellow Mini Head No 3119 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6290549/mini-head-no-3119"">6290549</a>]</li>
	<li>Torso - Black Mini Upper Part No 4594 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6254472/mini-upper-part-no-4594"">6254472</a>]</li>
	<li>Legs - Black Mini Lower Part No 408 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6143335/mini-lower-part-no-408"">6143335</a>]</li>
</ul>

<p>The bright red helmet was introduced in 2019 and appears in nine City sets.&nbsp; The torso is only in four&nbsp;City sets and one Spider-Man set, so is still relatively rare.&nbsp; It is similar to older ones however.</p>

<p>Appearing in 31 sets the legs are quite common, but as would be expected with a named character, his head is only in three sets other than here.&nbsp; Two are City Fire sets that state Clemmons, but the other is the Haunted House [<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/10273-1/Haunted-House"">10273</a>].&nbsp; Maybe it was Clemmons&#39; day off and he went for a day out.</p>

<h3>Main Build / Parts</h3>

<p>The build is easy enough and is made from 26 parts, and constructed quickly in 12 steps.&nbsp; The quad bike looks great and I really like the cool yellow / bright red colour scheme that the fire sets currently have.&nbsp; The rarest parts have to be the Racers Guard 2.5 x 4 [<a href=""https://brickset.com/parts/6291789/racers-guard-2-5-x-4"">6291789</a>] in Cool Yellow as they only appear in the Fire Helicopter Response set [<a href=""https://brickset.com/sets/60248-1/Fire-Helicopter-Response"">60248</a>], which unfortunately had one of the pull cord helicopters that were a big miss for me.</p>

<p>All other parts are quite easy to obtain should you wish to.&nbsp; As this is a comic set you don&#39;t get any extra parts once built.&nbsp; Unfortunately however there is no fire included for Clemmons to put out.&nbsp; Just a 2X2 jumper plate with a flame attached would have added playability to the set.</p>

<h3>Verdict</h3>

<p>This is a really good little set and ideal for the comic line.&nbsp; It falls fractionally short of five stars from me for a couple of minor reasons.&nbsp; I didn&#39;t mention it above, but you don&#39;t get a hair element for Clemmons and the inclusion of some kind of fire to battle would have added to the set.&nbsp; If used with other fire themed sets it will look perfect.</p>

<p>Next up is a bright orange motorbike and Pete Python.&nbsp; He appears to be a private detective, so not exactly another police themed set, but close.&nbsp; So far 9 out of the 31 comic sets have been police.</p>
