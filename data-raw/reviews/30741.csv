I really enjoy the seasonal BrickHeadz because not only are they nice display pieces, but they also appeal to a lot of non-Lego fans. This is sure to appeal to kids and adults alike.</p>

<p>This is the second BrickHeadz model to include a moving feature -- his mouth opens and closes like a real nutcracker with a lever in the back. It&#39;s a really great feature to include. The opening isn&#39;t big enough for a peanut, so this is just for fun! ;-)</p>

<p>All of the seasonal BrickHeadz sets to date have decorative mini-builds to accompany them.&nbsp; The Nutcracker includes some gifts on one side and a nice little Christmas tree on the other. The pearl gold buttons, epaulets and belt buckle on his uniform are nice touches. I think including a sword would have added another level of distinction but you&#39;re free to add anything you like.</p>

<p>This set comes in three bags within the box. The instructions are clear and the building process is quick like other BrickHeadz models. The part selection is great for SNOT building if you want to disassemble him the other 11 months of the year.</p>

<p>I want to note that my ratings are based on comparing this with the other BrickHeadz sets I have because I would rate them differently from standard Lego sets that have playable features. I highly recommend this set. I think it&#39;s great.</p>
