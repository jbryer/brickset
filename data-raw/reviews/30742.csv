<p>In my opinion, this might prompt a lot of people to buy this set. It has a fantastic selection of minifigures. Each has some type of exclusive part and they ALL have new moulded heads (except Oscar). My favourites are Big Bird and Cookie Monster.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Exterior:</p>

<p>- The exterior of this set is almost perfect. The building is so fun to build and looks just like something you would find in New York. There are so many small details I love such as the cute fire hydrant, big bird&#39;s nest, and even that iconic street sign.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interior:</p>

<p>- The interior of this set shines as well. It is so colorful and uses a plethora of interesting pieces to create a fun environment. The first floor is a kid&#39;s bedroom, most likely Elmo&#39;s. Love the new fish piece and that bunny from series 20 returning. The second floor is better. It has some nice stickered elements as well as some nicely built furniture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Issues?</p>

<p>- Only 1 small issue. Hooper&#39;s store is very exposed at one angle, which can look odd. other than that, this set is amazing</p>
